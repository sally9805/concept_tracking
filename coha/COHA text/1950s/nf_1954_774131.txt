txt  | possible you are afraid , way deep down inside , of your homosexual tendencies . Everyone is basically two-sexed . But in the vast majority of cases people try firmly to be entirely what is thought to be a " man , " or entirely what is considered a " woman , " in accordance with the sex organs nature provided . Most people are taught that homosexuality is absolutely dreadful without ever being told that everyone has some of it in him , or her , just as everyone is narcissistic ( loves himself ) to some degree . Some people are even alarmed when they find themselves having feelings or behaving in some way culturally considered as belonging exclusively to the opposite sex , let alone the horror they have of any overt homosexual responses , however mild . Reactions against one sex dressing like the other may very well arise from a fear of homosexuality , or to put it another way , a fear of not being as " manly " or " womanly " as one " should " be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States so far as dressing is concerned . In childhood both sexes are now , a large part of the time , dressed alike by their mothers , in " boys ' clothes , " until the children begin to have personal preferences . Then the girls often dress quite like boys , in shirts and shorts or blue jeans . Women now wear " men 's " clothes when they feel like it without facing much , if any , criticism , and more women feel like wearing trousers more often with each generation .  | There is , of course , a great deal that is useful and efficient about men 's clothes and it seems natural that women who are uninhibited by outworn ideas of what 's proper for females take them up . This is part of the " freeing " of women , and surely " free " women are of greater social and moral value to a world in which they take an active part than those who live a proscribed " womanly " life . People who argue against the equal right of females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dress for it as they please , are waging a losing battle the world over . Free women who wear " men 's " clothes at times are merely increasing their efficiency just as they did when they dropped their crinolines , loosened and lightened their " women 's " clothes in every way . Their femaleness is in no way impaired by all this . They remain as sexually attractive to males and as able to bear children as females ever were . It 's their " womanliness , " their right only to keep house and raise children that 's going by the boards , not their femaleness , American men have been going through a similar metamorphosis , but this has n't gone far enough and is n't widespread enough for it to have influenced their clothes very much ? or , it would appear , their sex lives . There is evidently some correlation between freedom in one 's sex life and freedom in one 's clothes . Whereas the female of the species , just as she has changed her clothes , seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's day , our men are very  | little more male sex-wise than they ever were , perhaps less so . However , American men now cook , clean , wash clothes , take care of children and otherwise enter freely into household and family activities in a way unheard of even a couple of generations ago . The taking up by the man of " woman 's " work is by no means as widespread as the entrance of women into activities outside the home , but it 's a start toward bringing about the kind of equality between the sexes that will result in their sharing the drudgery of life , working at what they feel like regardless of sex , and both sexes dressing alike when they choose . For helping with housework and children , males have perfectly efficient clothing , namely , trousers and shirts , clothing so efficient that a great many women who never wear trousers otherwise have taken to " men 's " clothes for household work . Men 's clothes will really be revolutionized when the male asserts his right to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It often seems to me that men 's bodies have not really been supposed to be physically beautiful since the great days of Greece . However it was much , much later that Western man entirely gave up his right to go about flaunting his charms in splendid or gay attire . The present fashion in which our men dress became completely established only about two hundred years ago , at the time of the French Revolution . It was then that all Western males gave up their  | rights to bright plumage , bequeathing them to the female . At the time of the French Revolution the elegance and luxury of the former French rulers was frowned on by the new rulers of France . Simplicity and a kind of uniformity were felt proper to the democratic kind of government which was being set up . Moreover , instead of important business being done by aristocrats in drawing rooms , now the important people were businessmen and their work was done in offices or supervising workshops . This serious business was felt to require serious clothes . It took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes . Let 's hope it wo n't take another to give our males back their right to dress as freely as their females . The well-cut sack suit is today the sign of the successful businessman , the most honorable position a man can hold in our country . This suit , with its binding jacket ( No . Do n't tell me it does n't bind . I used to wear them sometimes , but now I only wear loose , comfortable jackets which I can scarcely feel on me at all. ) ? the jacket worn with rather tight comparatively uncomfortable trousers , a shirt , tie , socks and heavy shoes , is certainly psychologically and physiologically cramping . Proof ? When American men are out to have a really relaxed time , even the most staid seize the opportunity to wear only some sort of slack or short , a shirt and maybe a sweater if it 's cold . When men go to work , they  | are n't supposed to be going to have a good time . A pity . The correct American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less correct man does n't wear welltailored sack suits any more , even to work . The less correct have replaced the well-tailored tight-fitting sack suit with some kind of slacks , usually gray flannel , and loosely cut sports jackets . The jacket still is n't as comfortable as a woman 's can be , or as not wearing a jacket at all would be , but it impairs a man 's efficiency less than an old-fashioned Brooks Brothers suit . Of course , to wear a sports jacket and flannel slacks is said to be " sloppy " by those clothing manufacturers who deplore the decline of the men 's suit business . But complaints of the tailors ' associations are having little effect . It 's more practical , as well as more comfortable , to wear unmatching jackets and slacks because trousers wear out faster than coats . Many of the younger generation have never owned a real suit and perhaps never will . A friend of mine who needed a job very badly was asked by a friend of his to come and be interviewed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " very well dressed . " He had on a handsome tweed jacket , woven of grays , tans , blacks and browns , his very best dark gray flannel trousers , a rare and wonderful tie in several shades of black , a light gray shirt , well-polished brown oxfords , black socks , and no hat . His friend met him in a large elegant Detroit reception room , took one look at him  | and hoarsely whispered , " Come in here , quick , " hastily pushing him into an office and closing the door . " What 's the matter ? " my friend asked in amazement . " What do you mean by coming here in those clothes ? " his friend demanded angrily . " If you 're going to work here you have to wear suits , and have one for every day in the week . You have to wear white shirts , and you ca n't go without a hat . If anyone here sees you like that , they 'll never hire you . " My friend proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could obtain business suits , white shirts and hats . He was offered the job , which he immediately declined on the grounds he 'd be miserable wearing a businessman 's uniform . It was finally conceded he could dress as he pleased . He is among those men who , in a quiet way , are helping break down prejudices against males being more comfortably and much less expensively dressed in executive jobs in offices of many varieties . But there are still too few of his kind , males who know in what clothes they feel well dressed , and who do something about it . Steadfastly , the vast majority of America 's " white-collar " men stick to those sober clothes ushered in by grim French Revolutionaries . Puritanically they deny their rights to the pursuit of all the mental and physical satisfactions women can get from dressing . For generations women have been supposed to have  | beautiful bodies and to care for them . They are expected to display their bodies and clothe them beautifully . When the results are pleasing , men and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how often does this happen to men ? In this sense , they are supposed to have no bodies at all . A man 's body is regarded merely as a useful instrument . You can scarcely tell at all how a man 's body is built when he has on a jacket and trousers . She has a marvelous back , torso , hair , arms , legs , eyes , lips , hips . She moves beautifully . She has such attractive clothes . What about him ? Well , the American male is displaying symptoms of becoming more man in his dress . The five-day week and the enormously greater amount of outdoor life America leads has brought changes . The other day in Gallup , New Mexico , someone hopped out of a car about a block from me , dressed in red and white checked gingham shorts and a rather vivid blue shirt . Only the shoes told me this was a man so I took a longer look at him and saw with pleasure that he was very well built . I also thought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had on the same clothes and that ten years ago the man would n't have been caught dead in what he had on . In all American suburban communities men and women dress quite alike part of the time . Both have adapted ambi-sextrous costumes composed of what were  | once male garments but done now in female material and color . As the work of the world gets more evenly divided between the sexes and the men have therefore less responsibility and more time for what are considered leisure pursuits , they will gradually cease being " manly " in the traditional American sense . The American male is already ceasing to be manly as far as family work goes . When you , an American man , stop being exclusively manly , as the women are ceasing to be exclusively womanly , you will freely take over whatever you like of " women 's " clothes and no doubt design yourself some better ones . You will no longer fear the loss of your maleness through displaying a perfectly human interest in looking alluring , in being as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have done this , be enabled to say things like , " Gosh , Jack has a wonderful new hairdo , " or " Did you notice the swing of the skirt on Bill 's new robe ? " or " Tommy has the most beautiful legs I ever saw , " instead of just admiring one another 's arrangements for display or waiting to be complimented on our own . I 'm not making jokes . Dressing can be great fun , but what 's the good if it 's only a one-sex street ? The sheiks of Araby , whose sexual exploits are legendary , wore skirts and they have never been considered sissies , to put it mildly . The American male is not only uncomfortable in his suits , but he has deprived himself of practically all  | the pleasures to be had from wearing colors , the feel of certain textures on his skin , the wind blowing on his body through his clothes , the sun and wind directly on his body , or parts of it . That our men are not allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible thing . Equally terrible is the fact that the business suit of America has become a world uniform for " important " men the world over . Before the United Nations had a glass house to live in , men from the East came to assembly and council meetings in their native costumes . Flushing Meadows was a gay place . Now that 's all over . One sees nothing but somber , heavy , tight , Americanstyle business suits at the U. N. If the important men who work in that world-wide institution are going to interest themselves only in business , as indicated by their dress , maybe the women of the world should open up an organization , the aim of which would be to promote pleasure and gaiety . Man can not live by bread or business suits alone .

No wonder a psychologist told me the other day that " women are on the ascendancy . " We women would like some rather definite indication , men , that we are n't going to ascend into that peace religion can not bestow and find the place populated entirely by females .  | How Long Is A Skirt ? GOODNESS KNOWS what will happen to women 's clothes in the next decade . War and depression , peace and prosperity , are all factors in the world of style and fashion and their advent is not predictable . At present , American women are able to dress very much to suit themselves insofar as they , as individuals , know who they are , and care to dress the part . A historical event that brought our women the possibility of dressing individually was the advent in the early Thirties of the American dress designer . The French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , in the roaring Twenties , used to complain that all American women dressed alike . What truth there was in this statement stemmed from the fact there were  | no creative American dress designers and all the original designs came from two or three French ateliers . Designers such as Chanel and Patou were the darlings of American mass-clothing production because they turned out simple things which Seventh Avenue understood how to make . Chanel was accused by some of her more talented fellow designers of turning out only chemises . However , decorated chemises apparently suited American women after World War I and were easy to run up en masse . All during the Twenties those who called themselves designers on Seventh Avenue went regularly to Paris to buy models which their bosses copied exactly and which the " designer " changed in various ways . This practice continued right up to World War II , but it diminished every year because after so and so much changing of French designs , American " designers " gradually got so they could dream up their own ideas . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new , young blood took up clothes designing in the United States , and without regard to what was going on in France . It will hardly seem possible to many of you who read this book that a mere twenty years or so ago nobody in the United States had ever heard of an American dress designer . In 1929 when I was designing in Paris , a man named Amos Parrish , who is still running a large advisory fashion business and known to everyone in the " trade , " came to see me and said , " Come home . America needs designers . " I went home , and to see him . Where I  | was told , " There will never be any accredited dress designers in the United States . " It took a lot of hard work on the part of a great many people to crack that attitude . Those of us who were determined to be American designers , and recognized as such , had to set up our own custom-made places in order to function . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the American press which would only publicize French names . A toast to Dorothy Shaver , now president of Lord and Taylor , is in order . She was the first to push a department store where angels , and Seventh Avenue , feared to tread . She bought American-designed clothes from some of us , had them manufactured on Seventh Avenue , and told the world what she 'd done . It was still a hard pull , but by the end of the Thirties American designers were an accepted fact , although the French still flourished . World War II dented the French couture badly and gave the American designers the time they needed to solidify themselves . When the shooting stopped , a press trickster named Christian Dior appeared , an unfortunate thing for the French . I am told Dior can design very beautiful clothes . But what we know in the United States are his overelaborated things launched with overwhelming press , radio and television hoop-la about length , fullness , tightness , bulk , and **36;1114;TOOLONG mandates . In 1946 Dior decreed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinach , as it merely resurrected what was centuries old in Western women 's clothes and created nothing new whatsoever . Bodices should be fitted , skirts full and about twelve inches from the floor or less , said the Frenchman . American women threw away their shorter clothes ; but whether it was to please Dior , or because they wanted a good excuse to splurge on clothes now the war was over , is a moot question . Having acquired longer skirts , they almost immediately began cutting them off regardless of Dior 's feelings or those of the American mass propaganda media which had backed him about 200 per cent . Dior kept on hurling his fashion edicts with less and less effect until in the fall of 1953 he really got slapped down . He gave out notice that skirts were to show the entire calf of the leg . A typical example of his inability to shell shock America into obeying him was the report from Paris of Eugenia Sheppard in the New York Herald Tribune . Announced Miss Sheppard : " Dior 's new new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are buying it plus extra inches at the hem . Any woman who ca n't adjust the length to suit her own legs best is just plain silly . " The French are doubtless still designing beautiful clothes , but the fact is of little importance to the American dress industry today ; and the would-be worldshaking pronouncements of a Christian Dior , despite the amount of air time and paper space they may get , have  | no real influence on any sound fashion reporter or dress manufacturer . It 's a mighty satisfactory thing for someone like me , who struggled for years to get American women to use their brains about dressing , to find a fashion reporter or dress manufacturer . It 's a mighty satisfactory thing for someone like me , who struggled for years to get American women to use their brains about dressing , to find a fashion writer for a great American newspaper calling a French publicity hound an old silly when he is one . I do honestly believe the triumph of the female mind over fashion is not too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence on the women of the United States and the Italian couture will never attain any real influence . Sure , we will buy what designs we like from all over the world , but we wo n't buy what we are told to buy . It is nice and fine for American designers to travel to Europe , but the real ones no longer go to look at clothes . They go to get a breath of a different atmosphere and escape the familiar air of California , Texas , Missouri , New York , or wherever they work . Going to Albuquerque , Oregon , or Timbuktu would serve the same purpose . So today we have our very own American designers who live here and in general understand American women and their lives . And as one who has gone out of her way to curse Seventh Avenue , the original heart and soul of our dress-manufacturing business , I must say , to the credit of the manufacturers , that whereas twenty  | years ago they insisted they could n't make intricately and well-cut clothes , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it well . However , just to keep my franchise on criticizing the rag trade , it 's about time American women demanded some decent inside finishing , sounder stitching of seams , and a quality of material commensurate with the price they 're paying for their clothes . There is always a rub , and as far as American women being able now to dress very much to suit themselves , here it is : instead of being bewildered into one silhouette which the French decide is most fashionable , women are now presented with a variety , all at the same time . We are also still presented with a considerable amount of nonsensical fashion advice to which some women pay attention . In February 1953 , Time printed the following : THE CARROT LOOK Dress Designer Elizabeth Hawes once held that feminine fashion is spinach and said to hell with it . Gimbel 's Manhattan department store holds that the crop has since changed . Until recently , it said in its ads , fashion was an onion ; now it is a carrot . " Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringbeans , pincushions , fiddles , pyramids and , in one supreme burst of misguided effort , men . But lately things have been pretty undrastic . Until now , that is . Now the fashion silhouette has been stood on its head . The little-top-and-full- skirt ( or onion look ) is not so new as the full-topand-little-skirt ( or carrot look ) . " You get the new carrot look , " said Gimbel 's , " by wearing big collars , rounded jackets , yoked shawls , standaway necklines and stoles . You get the carrot look by wearing slim , clinging skirts . If you will insist on full skirts , for reasons aesthetical or anatomical , you shoo the fullness to the rear and never wear more than one petticoat . It 's also possible to look utterly 1953 by standing on your head . " At the very moment Gimbel 's was humorously promoting the carrot look ( a fine indication that fashion is no longer being taken too seriously ) , they were also , in 1953 , advertising its opposite , the Dior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an American woman to look like a carrot , test tube , pyramid , ballet dancer , and on and on , a fact which can make life quite bewildering . Of course , if you are a carrot , you should try to dress the part . But consider that the spirit of a carrot may reside in its lovely green headdress rather than in its upside down orange obelisk of a root . You ca n't possibly pick what will really suit you unless you are on pretty familiar terms with your own spirit . American designers understand that you may fit loosely into a number of categories , by virtue of your occupation , of the psychological factors which make you want your clothes tight or loose , thick or thin , variously colored . As a basis for individualizing your dressing , you  | may pick a specific silhouette , and then you can set yourself apart with accessories , make-up , hair-do , all of which I talk about later . But when you go to pick the silhouette that is going to make you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of designs . How can you distinguish , with any accuracy , between a well-designed and a badly designed female garment ? To begin with , if the naked silhouette of the female in the garment is very much blurred and distorted by a great number of drapes , bows , flounces , the garment ca n't possibly fuse with the wearer but simply lives a life of its own . No garment which distorts the shape and motion of the wearer is beautiful , nor is any garment beautiful which emphasizes more than one or at most two of your sexual characteristics . You will tire of such clothes , often not knowing the reason why . They are produced by designers out of sheer whimsy ; and if you buy them to fulfill some whim of your own , you will be forever looking for another dress , your clothing bills will be fierce , and it is quite safe to say you are probably largely dissatisfied with your life . American women who buy clothes that are designers ' distorted whims are as perverse and distorted as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for men to brood over this item of information and start paying serious attention to how any female they may be pursuing is attired . The buying of  | this kind of clothes is n't doing anybody any good except the clothing manufacturers and dress shops whose bank accounts it swells . If the garment is so designed as to attempt to attract attention to more than one or possibly two parts of the body at once , the effect is bewildering . In women 's clothes this is an all-important factor . The object of " women 's " clothes being to distinguish them as females , a designer may draw attention to their breasts or welldefined waists or their rounded hips or buttocks . But it is enough to call special attention to one , or possibly two , of these sex characteristics by ornamentation , drapery , fullness or tightness . If your designer tries loudly to call attention to all your especially female sex characteristics at once , the entire objective will be lost because nobody can see and appreciate everything at once in a four-ring circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by women for centuries has been that with the fitted top and flaring or soft full skirt . This accentuates the upper curves of the female torso and , at the same time , adds grace to the body in motion and a certain dignity when the skirt is long . Bipeds never look as dignified as those who are in reality , or seem by virtue of their clothes to be , more securely attached to the earth 's surface . Four-footed animals seem to have more dignity than those with two feet , and when the Roman senators wore togas , they certainly did it to make them- selves seem more imposing and dignified . Arabs in flowing robes or American females in long ball gowns are far more dignified-looking than men in tight trousers or females in short skirts . Not that the object of life any more is to be very dignified , but you should know this in case dignity in your dress is your objective . The shoulder and sleeve treatment in the basic modern Western female garment has varied and continues to vary from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been natural , sometimes high , as in the Directoire . The full skirts have been variously cut : gored , on the bias , gathered . But the over-all silhouette remains fitted over the breasts and back , tight at the waist , and flaring below . The essentially straight silhouette for females of the Western world only came in with that post-World War I female rush for freedom , which included the idea that women should resemble men . Like the male sack suit , it adds no grace to any figure , still or in motion . Somewhere along the line the notion arose in the U. S. A. that very tight form-fitting clothes were more sexy for females than those which were only tight in spots , but this has no relation to what is called a straight silhouette today . The form-fitted look is anything but straight and is associated chiefly with ladies of easy virtue , although anyone disinterested in the possible subtleties of clothes can " get away with it " if she is built like a Venus .  | The straight-silhouetted women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangover of the **31;1152;TOOLONG days three decades ago . However , I lean to the view that women who go for the straight silhouette are reflecting the rigidity of their hearts and souls . They willfully refuse the appearance of grace and easy motion which flowing skirts give . The tight clothes they select ( tight rather than form-fitting ) positively restrict their freedom of motion , and far more than men 's clothes do , since the female who wears such clothes is always thoroughly and adamantly girdled and brassiered . Among those for whom I designed clothes I had my share of the **25;1185;TOOLONG type . They proved to be the most nervous , tight , and difficult of my customers . They were nervous and tight in their homes , with their children , probably in their bedrooms and in bed , as well as in my shop . They led their lives in definitely prearranged patterns from which they seldom deviated . They at once wanted to be bound and supported by their clothes . The milk of human kindness did n't flow from them any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the staffs of our high-class fashion magazines are of this variety . The Duchess of Windsor is also a sound example . She knew what she wanted and she got it and kept it . If she were forced to go about in a comfortable light Greek tunic or a peasant blouse and skirt her entire personality would fall apart . Aesthetically , the worst thing about too-tight-for- comfort , straight women 's clothes is that it 's impossible to sit down in them without having them wrinkle up over the stomach . Any garment which does n't allow full freedom of the motions called for when it is worn is impractical and ugly . And there is sure to be something rather ugly , or at least dull and uninspiring , about the woman who either deliberately or unconsciously lets her bodily motions be hampered by clothes . Perhaps this is somewhat forgivable in men as they 're so sunk in traditional manly clothing that only a major mass effort will free them . But women today do it by choice . Will those of my female readers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they had them on ? It is , of course , quite possible to design clothes with a relatively straight silhouette which do not impede motion or wrinkle over the stomach , and they can be bought . They are n't too tight . They 're just devoid of motion , like Chinese coolie clothes which are quite handsome . A certain number of my customers ordered such clothes , always in darkish colors , for shopping , charity meetings , traveling , or their business offices . They seemed to feel it was " good taste , " when one did not wish to beguile or be beguiled , to become as much a part of the background as possible even to the extent of not attracting the attention a flowing garment always does however unobtrusive the color . A billowing skirt has for hundreds of years happily announced , " Here is a  | female ! " And the time has sure enough come when plenty of American females are n't at all times interested in proclaiming their sex so obviously . Maybe the day is coming when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly occupied with matters other than sex . " Meanwhile , as you undress , consider that the straight , tight women 's clothes of America are usually recommended as " high fashion " because most of those who firmly believe in and promote high fashion are , like Old Man Fashion himself , would-be dictatorial characters who are tense and tight . Just because you may be nervous about how you should dress , do n't let them influence you into relinquishing your right to add grace to your body . However , if you believe your personality will be lost by wearing graceful clothes , then thank heaven you can get a nice straight sheath to keep you partially immobilized . And if anyone tries to take it away from you , pay no attention . Just make sure it truly represents your tight and sheathed attitude toward life . A warning here , lest you be carried away by too much billowing . If you are the type who truly longs to be a Southern belle at all times , regardless of taking up twice the space available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove yourself to a large estate replete with servants . When the manufacturers finally gave in to the idea American women really wanted wide skirts , the miniature crinoline was brought out in an effort to give you a wide , billowing skirt without the manufacturer putting  | in enough goods to get the effect in a sound manner . If you 'll run yourself up a dirndle or gored skirt , using enough goods of proper texture , you 'll get the effect you want without that unmanageable stiff underpinning . Or keep looking until you find a full enough skirt readymade . They exist . Do n't think that the mere wearing of a relatively wide skirt of necessity leads to giving an impression of grace . A crinoline very definitely leads a life of its own regardless of the motion or grace of the wearer .

In the mid-Thirties , I was fighting right in the middle of the hat-removal controversy and here we are , less than twenty years later , with the battle won . The majority of us , taking the population as a whole , permit ourselves to wear or not to wear a hat , or any other decoration or covering on the head , entirely according to our own feelings on the subject . I certainly hope the delightful dreams about other articles of dress which I have in this book will turn true within as short a time .

I have always considered it a tribute to my efforts to make America a freer and more democratic nation that Mr. Bernays , faced with a big job , called me into his office to personally try and set me straight about hats and the necessity for headgear as he saw it . " Hats ? " Mr. Bernays explained to me seriously pacing around his office and eying my hatless head rather , covertly ? " are crowns ! " And crowns , as everybody is supposed to know , are symbols of aristocracy and breeding .

Lower class of me , carrying a hat , I thought . I told Mr. Bernays about the peeress and her remarks . Then I also reminded him that the two Princesses , Elizabeth and Margaret , had gone without hats for some years , like all upper-class British children , and that it was only when the hat manufacturers of England had protested vociferously that the royal pair had been forced into hats . They had not , however , been substituting hats for their crowns .

I had no idea there were any reporters present and certainly no thought that my remarks would hit the front page of the New York press the next day . Not that I cared . But a large millinery association cared very much . They had invited me , weeks before , to come and speak at a luncheon in honor of the hat business unaware that I was one of those women who had willfully discarded her crowns . When the frontpage story broke they phoned to nervously suggest I should perhaps not speak but just come along and sit at the speakers ' table , perhaps . I helped them out of their dire predicament by saying I guessed it would be better all around if I just stayed away . They did not protest . Instead , I guess they decided to hire Mr. Bernays who  | had a deserved reputation as an expert propagandist and let him deal with the threat of a hatless America . Mr. Bernays , of course , had no success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to get at through the press and radio . Maybe if he had propagandized the angle that no girl could get a man without a hat , he 'd have succeeded . As it was , his timing on trying to pass off hats as crowns or signs of respectability was way off . Why , after all , did we ever wear hats in the first place ? In the early days of big migrations of hatless European " peasants " to this country , it was felt necessary for all who wished to make it plain they were above the immigrant class to advertise that fact by wearing a hat . By the time Mr. Bernays tried to rake up and set fire again to that un-American feeling , we had no peasants ; every- - body had a hat in America and nobody even remembered why you had to wear one . There seemed to be some unwritten law enforced upon the young by parents , schools , churches and social arbiters about hats . Since the law served no useful or delightful purpose , people just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really interfere with their personal pleasure . The milliners would have done better to appeal to the more imaginative American designers in 1936 than to a propaganda expert like Mr. Bernays . One day , I recall , Muriel King , a New York dress designer , Mr. John , the fabulously fine hat designer , and myself were invited to  | have a drink by a group of top fashion writers . Neither Muriel nor I wore a hat . We were no sooner greeted than we were taken to task by the fashion gals who said , among other things , that we were ruining our friend Mr. John 's business . John just snickered at them . " Listen girls , " he said , " what do I care whether women wear hats ? If they do n't want to wear hats I 'll sell them hair ribbons for $50 each . " The equivalent of which , as smart America knows , he proceeded and continues to do . But today his " ribbons " are more likely to sell for $100 than $50 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a considerable number of men in white-collar jobs who meekly continue to wear hats to work because " one must . " When these mice , masquerading as men , get up the gumption to please themselves rather than conform to custom or what the boss wants them to do , the men 's hat business in the U. S. A. will be in a worse way than the women 's , since men do n't permit themselves such charming or frightening frivolities as women and are not likely to turn to fifty- or hundred-dollar " ribbons . " The bulk of the women 's " hat " business today is done not in hats at all but in little doodads which are sometimes quite charming and sometimes quite ugly , or just sheer nonsense . You may , of course , still buy a real hat if you like , which likewise may be ugly or beautiful , amusing or serious . However , there are comparatively few men and very few women left who feel they must  | wear anything on their heads except to certain ceremonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats , fashion no longer operates as a potent force and this I believe to be the straw in the wind which is blowing that dictator Herr Fashion the Fuehrer out of the dressing picture and leaving individuals to figure out , and dress in , their own style . The straw is blown by a wind composed of the accumulated pooh-poohs of myriads of American women . I had better , right here , differentiate for you between Fashion and Style , according to Webster , Hawes and Shakespeare . Mr. Webster says Fashion is dressing in a way which is favored at the time , while Style implies a distinctive manner of dressing adapted by those who have taste . In Fashion Is Spinach I defined Fashion as a dictator who not only once forced people to dress in the way he favored at the time but also did his best to force perverse changes in women 's clothes as rapidly as possible so that American business could sell more things . Fashion , said Shakespeare , is a " deformed thief . " By Webster 's definition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , they dress in a way which is favored now but with so little distinction that one is seldom justified in saying any one of them is displaying much taste . American men , as a group , behave much more like sheep than do women . A great many men who have plenty of taste , insofar as other things go , do not permit themselves to use taste sufficiently in their  | manner of dressing . American men have never really been stylish . They are , however , fashionable ? in a drab , somber and uncomfortable way . Many of our women are also merely fashionable , usually as boringly and with as little distinction as the men . These women look like department-store-window dummies or mannequins , like photographers ' models on their way to work , or the successful women business executives as depicted in the movies or on TV . Fashionable as women may be , they at least have more distinctive differences in their clothes than men do when viewed in occupational groups such as housewives , young girls trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show the world that their husbands are successful , or the simple clothes-horse group . And within all these occupational groups there are those females who in some way manage to express their own individuality in their dress . They are not merely fashionable . This thing called Style , which Mr. Webster says implies a distinctive manner of dressing adapted by those who have taste , is another matter . People who follow fashion edicts put forth by alleged " fashion experts " have no taste . They do n't savor what 's offered them and accept it or reject it on the basis of whether it suits their lives and personalities . " Good taste " in dressing is a tricky thing to define because what 's " good taste " in one place is " had taste " in another . What 's good taste in the 1950 's , such as a woman wearing a pair of shorts and halter or a  | man wearing shorts on certain occasions , would have been said to be in terrible taste in 1915 on the very same occasions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? Good taste can properly be defined as what is consciously and thoughtfully found by a certain person in a certain place at a certain time to be suitable . It not only involves the individual and his reactions but it also involves the feelings of others which must be taken into consideration if one does n't want to make people unnecessarily uncomfortable . For example , if your grandmother thinks strapless dresses are disgusting , you avoid wearing them in her presence . Beautiful , useful and practical innovations in dressing are brought about by socially secure people who are not swept off their feet by new ideas but thoughtfully consider situations and come up with answers which are sound . In America these people may be in any income group . They have taste , good taste . They take their time making decisions , and are quite certain about what they do and why they do it when they at times appear dressed in some startling way . The first American women who wore slacks as public dress endured an enormous amount of social criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because they were n't trying to make spectacles of themselves . They had decided that slacks could be useful and practical and attractive , and therefore could be worn by almost anyone and in every public place .  | Slacks are , however , not always attractive . It depends on how they 're cut and on the figure and movement of the one who 's wearing them . But since they are certainly practical and useful , women who ca n't be beautiful in them , like plenty of men , wear them anyway , especially when being attractive is n't the main objective . Style in dressing has long been associated with a manner of dressing adapted by the upper classes of various nations , such as the dress of the early Egyptians , Greeks , Japanese , Chinese . We have very little positive feeling about how the slaves or serfs looked , but we have a fairly clear picture of how the nobles of Greece and Rome and the gods and goddesses were dressed . They were garbed in a pattern developed in accordance with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and always beautiful in that it was an expression of the relatively satisfactory lives of the wearers . These ancients had taste , but it was a kind of group taste allowing very little for the expression of individual psychology . Individual taste was expressed only by subtle differences in dress , such as color , print or embroidery , jewelry or other ornaments . The basic form of the national garments was identical . Some American men maintain today that they dress stylishly and that they display their individuality in subtle ways : through their ties , shoes , and so forth . They very decidedly do show individual differences in such ways , but the total effect of the way American males dress  | most of the time is essentially ugly . This is partly because men wear , a large part of the time , what is clearly not suitable to the occasion , and partly because half the time when men try to get comfortable they do it by effecting some sort of unattractive compromise between what is considered " proper " and what is merely more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the American male of today needs most is a sense of style . Meanwhile he remains smug enough to think men 's fashion is really something better than spinach . American women have ways of dressing suitable to many occasions and temperatures and , insofar as they exercise individual taste , may be quite stylish , quite handsomely dressed , although that 's rare . The exercise of really individual taste in dress is still in its infancy considering all we are beginning to know about the psychological differences between individuals . But it is along individual rather than fixed national lines that I have always believed real style in the U. S. A. would develop . Individual style seems the logical outcome in an individualistic free-enterprise system . However , there is today the distinct possibility that we Americans will end up dressed like a bunch of robots . The means are now at hand . For years I have dreamed and talked and written about a new production process for making clothes , shoes , bags , and innumerable other items . A synthetic substance would be poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipped into a chemical mass and , presto , the whole garment or object would come out in one piece . All the raising or gathering of natural stuff ? wool , cotton , flax , hides ? would be eliminated and so would all the weaving , tanning , cutting and sewing . One of the many Mr. du Ponts has engaged , I 'm told , in perfecting some such process . It means that when he gets ready ? and if he does n't hurry up , please , someone else will ? we shall have enormous masses of similar things to dress in , all very cheap . These clothes I always thought would settle the problem of all dressing of purely utilitarian purposes : work clothes , army uniforms , all things worn when being attractive is n't a main objective . Armed with a du Pont , or someone else 's , Futuro Dress for all purely utilitarian purposes , Americans could then develop very special ways of garbing themselves . Individuals would have designed and made for them wholly individual costumes which they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because there are basic likenesses among certain people , they would , as a group , dress somewhat alike , differentiating themselves through their accessories and colors , manner of dressing their hair , or in minor ways . But there would be a vast variety of differently oriented groups and some people would not quite fit into any pattern or would dress in entirely different ways at different times , according to how they felt . Of course , it could turn out that in case of a bad war or  | long depression , we could all find ourselves , of necessity , wearing a Futuro Dress . Dressing like a robot is very easy in one way ? like being in the army ? : we would n't have to make up our minds about clothes . But the more we accept orders , or robot clothes , the more we are apt to become robots . Therefore , just in case we have to go through some such period , I think we had better give some extra thought to our Selves , to who we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves for displaying the facts . It would be terrible to have us turn out like men from Mars , working with clocklike scientific precision , slick machines , all dressed in Futuro alikeness . You are n't afraid it 'll happen ? Well , let me tell you that most serious students of dressing end up either predicting or tentatively suggesting that the future of it all is nudity . It seems to me that nudity would be , like robot clothes , a completely colorless bore . And one soothsayer , Mr. Gerald Heard , foresees the day when we shall all have little shiny shells which will serve us both as clothes covering and as a personal means of flying about anywhere . A flying suit , as it were . You surely would like your little personal flying equipment , but if it means relinquishing the delights associated with dressing and undressing , might you not choose to remain earth-bound ? As to how you must dress , earthbound , this surely is your own affair . When it seems necessary to make compromises it should certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unduly upset the humanly sensitive feelings of other beings . So why are all these white-collar-job males still going to work in hats ? Many women in similar jobs with similar responsibilities and similar pay do n't find they are upsetting the humanly sensitive feelings of most people by going hatless . The hatmakers may be upset , but only because of their dwindling profits , not their love of humanity . To what extent then are hats , or head coverings of any kind , a practical necessity ? Only when hats are vital to keep excessive heat , wet , or cold off one 's head . And what is excessive for one person is not for another . It would seem that people who must work for hours in hot sun need a head covering . No one forces them to wear hats , yet they , nevertheless , have done so for centuries . It may be vital to your hairdo to keep it out of the rain , but it is not vital to your health unless the rain is very cold and you 're out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital to health to keep one 's head covered except in extremely cold weather . The proof of what I say is before everyone 's eyes daily and increases yearly . Just look at the kids of America who have never worn hats . To what extent , and why , are hats or head coverings a social necessity ? The church , of course , requires women to cover their heads . And there are a few occasions still left when the older generation is mortally offended to see men arrive without hats , which , if worn ,  | must then be removed . On many similar occasions women arrive without hats which , if worn , have to be kept on . Most of us , on occasion , humor the old people who find hatlessness offensive . Except for the fantastically old school rules about proper garb for " the armed forces , " there seems to remain only the economic necessity for wearing a hat . Bosses who want their employees to wear hats , must themselves also wear them to work , otherwise the employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not respectable to be seen without a hat must either risk being fired , or wear a hat to work . This is patently so silly that it just ca n't go on much longer . Thus at least one miracle of undressing has occurred recently in the United States of America . The vast majority of the civilian population have decided that outside of church , 99.9 per cent of the time they are free to do as they please about covering their heads . I prophesy that this attitude will ultimately extend to everything connected with dressing . It is so pleasant and logical a human attitude that eventually we will grow up to it . But just how many of you feel perfectly free to dress entirely as you please , or even really know how it would most please you to dress ? As you undress , ask yourself whether the thing you are removing from your body is a thing that you , of your own free will and out of your own personal desire , have put on . Or did someone demand or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Barefoot Boy With Cheek ANATOLE FRANCE once said that if , a hundred years after he 'd ascended into heaven , he could have but one book to tell him what was going on in the world , he 'd choose one which showed him how people were dressing . This , he said , would tell him more than any philosophical , historical , or fictional work purporting to explain about life . More than any other single article of dress , the shoes people wear can tell how they feel about life and what it all adds up to . Most people are sublimely ignorant of this fact . They undress their feet for sheer animal pleasure but few ask : Why was I wearing these particular shoes , or any shoes , in the first place ?  | Men today have very little choice of footwear , and yet it 's perfectly amazing how much you can tell about a man by his shoes if you study the matter a bit . When I was a very young girl and used to enjoy hunting , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable amount of gadding about to dinner parties where everyone was dressed in evening clothes . I used to sit down at the start of the hunt , sip a cocktail , and let my eye run around the floor to find out whether there were any men present wearing pumps . They were permissible , but the fashionable male evening footwear then was patentleather oxfords . Pumps are much more comfortable and suede pumps are , of course , softer and therefore nicer than those of patent leather . Whenever I spotted a pair of pumps , I 'd arrange to get myself introduced to the wearer . I knew , by virtue of the fact that my quarry was the wearer of the most comfortable footwear considered socially correct for the occasion , he would be far more interesting than any of the men in oxfords . And , generally , that he would have a good sense of humor . To be sure , he often turned out to be quite an old gentleman , but sometimes even quite young ladies are on the hunt merely for intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the country a good deal and was often the only civilian on a flight , the rest being khaki-clad officers . I found I could  | play a similar game . American officers do have some choice of footwear , and one type was a shoe with perfectly plain leather covering the front of the foot from toe-tip to the arch and up over the instep . The back of the shoe turns into a strap which buckles over the instep . The shoe originated in England long before the war but was seldom worn here . When an officer was the type who saw to it he got a seat on the aisle so he could get his feet out into it , or would throw one of his legs over the chair arm , he almost invariably had on this shoe . I deduced , and experiment proved me correct , that his nature was akin to that of the men who wore evening pumps . He wanted comfort ( namely , the aisle seat ) , and although he was n't permitted any really comfortable shoes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got so I 'd go peering around the floor in the waiting room before the plane left , spotting that type shoe . The wearer almost always turned out to be a good and interesting conversationalist , matching the quality and interest of his shoes . Men whose oxfords , however otherwise designed , have the widest toes , are more open , secure , comfortable characters than those who prefer more pointed toed shoes . It may be that in Medieval times the long pointed toes of shoes were phallic symbols . The Freudians see them as sex symbols today . Sheer nonsense ! Modern pointedtoed shoes , for either sex , came along in our day because  | they differentiated the wearer from the common laborer who simply could n't bind his ( or her ) feet and still get his work done . If you start examining men 's oxfords you will find that men who wear those with more pointed toes are in some way tight and insecure about their social position . There are a few super-refined American males who consciously associate slimness of foot with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority of the more-pointed-toe group unconsciously associate long slim feet with being aristocratic . It is important to these men , whether they know it or not , to make sure they have the outward and visible signs of what they consider " aristocratic . " Perfectly fine sandals and comfortable moccasin-type shoes are available for men today . But it is still not considered manly to wear sandals except for beach or country sports , and even so most American males would n't be caught dead in a sandal . Sandals , the footgear of millions of males for centuries , are just not masculine enough for American men . The moccasin-type shoe is a fine thing in a way because it stretches fast and gets like bedroom slippers . But when men have tried wearing the moccasin-type when they were supposed to be " properly dressed " there are those around them who exclaim , " Oh , how sloppy ! " and they keep on carping and criticizing until few men with any aspirations toward getting  | on in the business world have the courage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footwear . The man you 'll meet in the " right " place in the " wrong " shoes knows he is indispensable in his job or can easily get another just as good or better . He does n't have any awed respect for the boss , goes hatless when he likes , quietly and unostentatiously asserting his rights to be at least ten per cent as comfortable as the women around him in the same office . The majority of American men wear unnecessarily stiff , heavy , and ugly shoes most of the time and rigorously cling to them . Either they are afraid of losing their jobs or their manhood , or , as they so often assert , they need " support " from their shoes . This is the type of " moral support " certain kinds of dressing offers . What you wear can anchor you in life as it is , and outwardly proclaim you are a part of it . In the case of men 's shoes , the male is firmly attached to earth , no flighty dreamer . Fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course , when people say they need " support " from their shoes , they mean they must have a stiff , tight shoe with some sort of arch support . Otherwise , they believe , their arches will fall . Most people have perfectly fantastic misapprehensions concerning the healthy functioning of the human foot . They not only willfully see to it that their toes are pinched , but honestly believe it is the arch of a shoe that keeps the arch of the foot in place . Some- one observed to me quite seriously lately that all American Indians had flat feet due to wearing moccasins . Quite the reverse is true . When I had my big custom-made dressmaking establishment , we used also to design and sell accessories . Among other things , we made to order little soft suede shoes with absolutely flexible elkskin soles about an eighth of an inch thick . Except in winter some of the customers , including myself , seldom wore anything else even for mountain climbing . Foot Gloves , we called them . The size was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper and drawing its outline . I was immediately accused by any number of people of trying to ruin my customers ' feet , break down their arches . This was absurd . If a person with an arch wears a shoe with a thin , flexible sole , the sole , after a few wearings , molds itself to the foot and goes right up into the arch . The arch of the foot is held up by a beautifully interwoven set of muscles which come from under the arch and go up and across the back of the lower part of the leg . It is only by constantly exercising these muscles that the arch is kept up , strong and firm . One exercise for strengthening the arch is picking up marbles with your bare toes . If you try it you 'll feel the muscles in the back of your leg above the ankle get tense . Dancing in bare feet is also very good arch exercise . Finding that my unprofessional opinion did not silence the critics of my soft shoes , I consulted a well-known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that the type of shoe I was making was by all odds the most healthy imaginable . Going barefoot , she said , would be ideal except that people who constantly go barefoot develop a very thick callus where the foot touches the ground , and if an infection develops under this callus it can be extremely serious . It is therefore better to wear some flexible foot covering . She went on to say she feared an increasing number of city children in the U. S. A. were going to develop flat feet . This she blamed on the increasing use of elevators . Most American children are made to wear stiff-soled shoes , and in such shoes about the only time the foot really bends and exercises the arch muscles is when the wearer walks up and down stairs . I took my Foot Gloves once to a well-known manufacturer of play shoes who agreed with me , and the foot doctor , that the shoes were perfectly fine . He knew about feet . Yet his play shoes had narrow toes and stiff soles . My shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he had all the machinery for making his and they were selling like hot cakes , there was no reason in the world that he could see for making any improvements . Later I tried to get justly famed Mr. Delman to make my shoes . He took me from his Fifth Avenue establishment to his factory , and one of the shoemakers , after examining my shoe curiously , said , most aloofly : " If you told me , Mr. Delman , these things were dug up  | in Europe back in the sixth century , maybe before Christ , I would n't be surprised . " Progress in civilization may perhaps be measured by the extent to which we Americans are showing signs of returning to the old custom of keeping our feet on the ground . In the last fifteen years , as compared to the two centuries previous , shoe progress has been quite phenomenal in the U. S. A. Of course , this is partly due to most of us having had not only one pair of shoes but two pairs at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a woman wants to explain the poverty and deprivation of her childhood , she will say , " I never had any Sunday shoes . " Certainly the American male , if he was poor as a boy , must have had the same feelings about " Sunday shoes . " Among the first moderns to regard the matter of foot covering from a purely utilitarian point of view were those who have always had plenty of shoes , including a selection just for Sundays . When it was n't going to make others squirm , they often chose not to wear any shoes at all . Let us call these people Innovators . Those that have shoes can afford to go barefoot and these Americans are now going barefoot or in socks or stockings to an amazing extent . I know one family who has a large and beautiful modern house and when you go in the first thing you often notice is a line of shoes by the door . If you 've been there before , and know what this means , and you feel  | like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , wiggling your toes pleasurably , proceed to join the bare- or stocking-footed family . The father is a Wall Street tycoon of no mean stature . Needless to state , he wears shoes in Wall Street . And when it appears that it would be really offensive to guests , the family keeps their shoes on at home . Last summer I was visiting a very nice woman who has a large estate , and a large family . It certainly did not occur to me to go down to dinner barefoot , nor during cocktails did I observe any bare feet . But after dinner I suddenly heard my hostess say , " Andy ! I wo n't have it . I do n't mind at all if any of you want to go barefoot , but I ca n't bear seeing the entire living room strewn with socks and shoes . Either come in barefoot or leave your shoes on . That girl , Patsy , whom you brought to dinner the other night did exactly the right thing . " A ripple of laughter went around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " " She left her shoes outside the dining-room door as she went in , " Andy said . " And that , " my hostess remarked , crossing one elegant high-heeled slipper over the other , " was perfectly all right . She arranged them neatly and they were out of sight . " In case you do n't care to go barefoot , and are a woman , you can find lots of very decorative , flat , opentoed sandals . The only trouble with them is they have  | stiff soles , and if you ever get into the habit of feeling your foot on the ground , bare or encased in a perfectly flexible sole , you begin to hate the feel of that rigid thing keeping your foot more or less immobilized . And opentoed sandals have to have stiff soles or the front ends of the sole bend under . There is , also , in the more comfortable female shoe department , a fair selection of ballet-type shoes , which a lot of young ladies wear in both summer and winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the soles are not soft or flexible enough to grow into the shape of the feet like Indian moccasins . When they have no ankle fastenings , these foot coverings , as they stretch , become very " sloppy , " and a number of wearers have n't achieved the knack of holding them on securely by curling their toes to clutch the soles . Therefore some young ladies sort of shuffle along , not a very alluring sight . Also , amazingly , these ballet shoes have fairly pointed toes , seeking to proclaim the slim , elegant , aristocratic foot despite the fact that they also say a girl would like to dance through life , or at least go through it with her feet on the ground . A slight confusion of arts and motivations , as one ca n't really dance or walk comfortably through life with one 's toes pinched . This type of ballet shoe is , surely , the forerunner of others , better-designed , softer , more flexible , and with soles the shape of real feet , not those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both  | sexes are becoming wider and roomier and are required to be worn less and less , we can expect both sexes in coming generations to demand , and receive , some very comfortable coverings for their feet . And this footwear will be beautiful once the principle is established . The high heel , which men gave up wearing with the death of the French kings , is certainly dear to many American women . Some say they ca n't wear anything else . This is true to the extent they have so long and consistently worn high heels that the muscles in the backs of their legs have been shortened . It hurts them to take even a few steps barefoot in their own boudoirs . Of course , if they cared to , they could exercise their leg muscles and gradually get them back to normal . American women were n't born unable to walk freely . Some of them have simply adapted a handy method of making it impossible to do any heavy work , or anything which requires them to stand for long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do this sort of work . A good many women can shift with ease from high heels to low heels to bare feet , and do . Why do they wear high heels at all ? After reading a very down-to-earth best-selling novel about a woman by a woman , I encountered the author . To my astonishment she wore three-inch spike heels . They absolutely did not go with the mind that had created the book . My curiosity increased so much in the following days that I wrote to ask her why she wore those  | heels . She responded with the brief but pointed explanation : " All the men I know who are really male want their women to look like whores . " It is rather a shocking surprise when anyone tells you the bare-faced truth , especially if you 're discussing high heels . American women are more touchy about high heels than about Dr. Kinsey 's report on their sex lives . There is obviously something shady about these heels in the minds of most of the wearers , or they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing them . A woman will say , much too firmly , " I wear high heels because I like them . " If you ask why , the subject is apt to be changed or , fairly often , one hears , " High heels make my feet look smaller . " If you ask why a woman wants her feet to look smaller , she will either evade the question or , sometimes , tell you that men like women with small feet . That 's an extremely broad generalization since , if it were a truth , a minimum number of women would be receiving all the male attention . We American women are not small-footed creatures . In the last two or three generations the length of the average American woman 's foot has increased by three or four sizes . And the American male does n't seem to care at all . According to my most recent poll , a great many young men prefer their girls to wear high heels for " dates . " A girl may go about her work or sports activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility of amorous delight floating about , the lady should wear high heels .  | A female in high heels appears more helpless than one in low heels , never mind the size of her foot . Wearing high heels , she presumably should succumb more easily to a male 's cave man tactics , although I hasten to add that I am not implying high heels are a synonym for round heels . High heels signal that the American female ca n't run away so fast and does n't even want to . That she has been quite as active as the male in bringing about a situation where he might act like a cave man is beside the point . The idea is that he , in his heavy shoes , should feel stronger and more capable than she on her fragile stilts . Never mind the realities . " Make the boys think that . . .

If she has by then actually grown into being a high-heeled type , and since practically nobody has any servants any more , life will be filled with complaints because the high-heeled type ca n't do housekeeping and child care without suffering . Will the women present now please pause for station identification and ask themselves : Do you wear flat shoes for housework and high heels for parties ? Why ? What do you think your high heels tell the world ? Do you find them sexier than low heels ? Why ? As to you men , it is imperative , if you 're considering marriage , to undress the feet of your possible future  | wife and find out why she wears the kind of shoes she does . If she wears flat shoes , there will be little need for discussion unless you prefer high heels . If she wears high heels , even though you prefer them , what does this forecast concerning her ability to be perfectly charming over morning coffee unless you make it ? Some women wear high heels at times for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is nothing more seductive to most American males than a female gotten up in a pair of fragile high-heeled sandals , a simple wide-skirted or slim housecoat , or tea gown , depending on the male , and with some knitting in her hands . It apparently gives a girl everything a man wants : fragility , grace , and all the attributes of a kind grandmother . This I know from personal experience , and if you think I ever confessed to my prey why I was gotten up as I was at the time of masquerade , you 're crazy . Women would cease being enigmatic to men if the men would examine thoroughly and critically how each individual woman is dressed , and why , instead of mentally or actually undressing the female with an eye only to what 's underneath the clothes . Nowadays I seldom wear high heels . I 'm very uncomfortable in them and I 've discovered that the kind of men I prefer like me barefoot or in flat shoes , although they 'll tolerate high heels when I find them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an act of  | some sort , like being a movie director 's idea of a successful dress designer , or authoress , or when I want something ? possibly a job , possibly money or co-operation for some cause . There is one point I feel should be brought up for discussion in mixed company by all women who are really interested in the effect their dressing has on men . This is the female shoe , with either high or low heel which has a hole in the toe just big enough to let the big toe protrude . This kind of shoe is apparently on the wane , but it tends to persist because a woman can wear a shoe which is really much too small for her if her toe can get through the end , and also because the opening does give some ventilation to the foot . According to my research , most men do not like these shoes . The Freudian symbolists say the hole with the toe sticking out is a phallic symbol and that American males are embarrassed by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phallic symbols for Freudians and not progress in electronics . The sight of a big toe feeling its way out of a too-short shoe is so aesthetically displeasing . I think we do n't have to go any further to explain why the American male dislikes such shoes . If Anatole France could survey the shoes worn in the United States today , he would find male life had changed very little since his day , when men stuck grimly or steadfastly to their responsibilities of running the na- tion , produced everything the nation needed except the children , and provided the " necessities of life " for the family . But what in the world would Anatole France deduce from the assortment of female footwear we could show him ? He might point out that we have in America a greater psychological variety of women than men , since no one has forced women to have so many varieties of shoes . Women need many kinds of shoes because they behave in many ways and do many different jobs . Anatole France would be pleased to note that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on in the U. S. A. But are American females merely gyrating from one thing to another ? Anatole might wonder . Have they made up their minds about their role in our twentiethcentury society ? No , he 'd have to conclude . Still , he would certainly feel that women are far freer , more imaginative , and may turn out to be more creative than the men if things go on the way they are going , to the end of this century . With a new century , men could turn into a bunch of drudges for the women who are today already developing new patterns of life .  | Whose Little Accessory Are You ? AN ACCESSORY , says Mr. Webster , is a subordinate thing . By that definition everything that goes into preparing one 's Self for public or private display should be an accessory . Today , women habitually use a large variety of what are commonly considered accessories , and men a fair number . As you strip yourself of your assortment of accessories , start investigating whether your accessories are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female who says , " I would be lost without my lipstick " is clearly being used by that lipstick . Gloves . How are you doing with your gloves ? If you 're a man , with the rarest possible exceptions , you never  | wear gloves except to keep your hands warm , or if your work requires them . If you are a woman , with the majority of you it is the same thing . But there are many women who , when they go out , always wear , or carry , gloves . Originally , this was required for " ladies , " who must not soil their hands . There is something quite delightfully insane in seeing a woman walking along a sweltering street in summer wearing a dress which leaves her arms , half her legs and half her back exposed . She is hatless , has dressed her stockingless feet in high-heeled open-work sandals , and then covered her hands with gloves . Her feet , of course , are getting filthier at every step . And whereas she can quite easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store or hotel , there are no public provisions for washing the feet . Moreover , this same woman may pick up her gloves on the way out of her house and never put them on at all . Or , if she has them on , she may remove them , to feel a piece of goods , or to eat , and then she often does n't put them on again . In such a case , about fifty per cent of the time , she loses them , or just one of them , which is even more aggravating . To the woman who clings to gloves through thick and thin , I should like to say that , as with the hat , you are no longer considered a primitive savage lowdown charwoman type if you own only a pair of nice warm winter gloves . And if you find you are constantly losing even  | those , sew them onto a long tape or ribbon which you can pull through either coat sleeve , just as thoughtful mothers secure their younger children 's gloves . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shorter winter coat sleeves continues , logic does not demand that a woman buy longer and longer and more and more expensive gloves . The same woman who assiduously covers her hands and arms usually has on a gossamer-thin pair of stockings , which , if they are nylon , are as cold in winter as they are hot in summer . Your arms can certainly get just as used to cold as your legs . In fact , except for necessary work gloves , there seems to be very little sense to gloves at all unless the temperature makes your skin get chapped . There are times when wearing gloves may be positively dangerous . I have a very sad story involving gloves and a bag which needs to be told in this book . It should serve to underline the fact that you have to determine your own course of action all along the line in the matter of dressing . Social demands may be so important you ca n't achieve that personal peace we 're after without social compromise . One warm spring night I acted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were taking two young ladies to the movies . It was the first time these young men had honored these particular young ladies . The young men had on neat woolen slacks and clean white shirts , well-polished shoes , argyle socks , per- haps underpants , and that was all . This was in a small , conservative , rich suburb on the East Coast . I did n't take notice of what the young ladies had on , but they looked neat and fresh and attractive to me , and they did not wear hats . The next week I was again requested by the two young men to be driver and noted with interest that only one of the former young ladies was being picked up . The following day I asked what had happened to the missing young lady . " She did n't pan out , " I was told . " What was the matter ? " " She wore white gloves and carried a bag . To the movies ! " After a long horrified silence I said , softly , " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shrug said everything : that any young lady who could dream of , or be talked into , wearing gloves and carrying a bag to the movies in that town was beneath contempt . I could weep when I think how the young lady must have felt after the episode , alone at home with her bag and gloves , for later I ascertained she had learned about the error of her ways through the school underground . If she had also worn a hat I ca n't imagine to what lengths the outraged feelings of her male escorts would have carried them . Often people can be terribly cruel to those who dress " wrong . " This type of cruelty is by no means limited to  | adolescents ; and while I am frankly saying what I think about this and that , it is not for purposes of influencing you but of causing you to think for yourself . It is as likely as not the young lady read about how to dress for a date in one of her magazines . Glove manufacturers and bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the editors usually know on which side their bread , and the publishers ' cake , is buttered . In the interests of simple humanity , fashion editors and writers should start reporting to the American people what exists and stop handing out edicts on how to dress based on theories unrelated to practices . One of these days , I have no doubt , all Americans will dress entirely as they wish . But before that happy day arrives , everyone in the world must have become secure and self-assured enough not to feel the necessity of seeking to burn at the stake all those who see life , and hence dressing , differently from themselves . Of course , if I felt like wearing white gloves to the movies , or not wearing them , and my escort took exception to my foible , I 'd probably just laugh in his face or tell him to go back from whence he came . However , like most of my readers , when I was young I sweated plenty of blood wondering whether I was dressed " right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloves , except when it was cold , because one summer day a man I liked a lot said to me , " What are you , of all people , doing with gloves in this weather ? "  | I said they were to keep my hands clean . He stared hard , then laughed uproariously . I looked too . I was n't wearing my gloves at all but carrying them . Bags . My grandmother , who stood about four feet nine up and down and across , to the day she died around 1912 , wore square-toed high-buttoned shoes , highnecked shirtwaists , ankle-length full skirts , and in all her skirts there was a pocket in the right side-seam . In all my girlish skirts there were no pockets . I wanted pockets so badly that once , when I was about five , I cut a slit in a brand-new dress , trying to make a pocket . My mother was furious and I was severely punished . That is , I had to sit on a chair for a whole hour . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a pocket , I did n't tell her what I 'd been trying to do , or I might have escaped the punishment . I 'm sure that this is one of the reasons why , as soon as I had mastered the art of cutting clothes and could turn my attention to details , I began putting some sort of side pockets in every dress I made that had a full skirt . On the right-hand pocket , I put a zipper . That was the money pocket . Both pockets were good and large , cut like men 's side-pockets . What price then a bag when there were pockets to be used ! Men do n't carry bags ? and for a most obvious reason . There must be millions of American women who would prefer not to carry a bag . Hanging it on oneself  | is not so bad , but even then it is an extra appendage and generally unnecessary . Men insist they need the dozen or more pockets which are to be found in a man 's suit , but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can carry a comb , a very flat powder case , a lipstick , Kleenex , my money , keys , shopping list , a couple of letters or other documents , my glasses , a few samples of material , or the equivalent of all this . What more does any woman need when she is just out for the day , or a few hours ? Yes , sometimes the pockets bulge quite a lot , but , being addicted to pockets , I almost always wear full skirts , so there is ample room to take care of the bulge , which is well below my hips because I have the large part of the pocket begin below my hip . The side pocket has started to turn up in a considerable number of women 's clothes , so much so that whereas it seemed as if no one except my nineteenthcentury grandmother and myself had ever conceived of such a thing when I started offering them to my customers , women now say firmly , " I think a dress without a pocket is impossible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manly in shape , and if they will put that zipper on one pocket , then women will be free to choose to carry a bag or not carry one . The one-pocket-zipper idea , by the way , should be incorporated into all men 's trousers . Carrying a bag is terrible if you like to walk along swinging your arms , and even the shoulder-strap type is  | always getting in the way . Once the useful pocket for women becomes an established fact , all women will demand pockets just as all men get them without asking . And even as no man I have ever met has said he wants to start carrying a bag , so , I think , all women will abandon their bags except at such times as a man carries a brief case or a dispatch case . And , to complete the thought , perhaps the men will by that time realize the enormous virtue of being able to hang a bag on themselves when necessary rather than encumbering their hands with a brief case . Men , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . Let them broaden the practice . Undressing includes inspecting that bag you are carrying . If it 's a large one there are probably a dozen things in the bag you do n't need , and in any case it is usually quite difficult to find what you want immediately . The condition of a woman 's bag betrays the condition of her mind . When I have to carry a bag it makes me so mad and frustrated that I can never arrange it so I can find anything , but must stir and take out and hunt until I am ready to scream . My mind becomes anything but neat and orderly . Some women who always carry bags manage to keep them in a state of complete disorder ; others keep everything in its place . The orderly type buys her bags with a view to whether they open easily , with one hand , and in such a way that  | the total contents can be surveyed . The neat-minded will make sure there are enough pockets and compartments in a bag so things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so many places to stow things that she inevitably forgets where she put anything . This type of woman will have various sizes of bags so she can have the amount of space she needs for the occasion . She will always empty her bag of anything she does n't need on a particular occasion and generally empty her bag entirely when she gets home and brush it out regularly . Yes , by their bags you can know them . And to the American male I 'd say that if you want a quick tip on the type of woman you 're out with , manage to get a good look inside her bag . To be fair , if the contents are in a horrible mess , ask her whether she likes bags or wishes she did n't have to carry one . Judging by myself ( a dangerous practice ) the fact that I lose everything in any bag I carry does not indicate that my kitchen is always in a mess or that my bureau drawers are continuously concealing chaos . A lot of women can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside , having learned to put on public dress skillfully , but what the public dress is covering may be of quite a different character . And if you are thinking of marrying the girl , remember that in the privacy of every home the public dress gives way to the private dress , which is far more revelatory.  | Neckties ? Male . Neckties can be quite beautiful and since they are the only way American men are allowed to be a bit gay , when not in sports clothes , it would be sad indeed if neckties disappeared just now . A way should be found to make them an accessory rather than the present " must " in the male wardrobe . This would be a real help to all white-collar men since neckties are so damnably uncomfortable in summer . It 's time a man realized that on a hot day he carries four thicknesses of material in his collar and collar band and then ties another three or four thicknesses around his neck . One day , in a favorite New York tie shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just what I needed for myself . It was winter , of course . I generally wear sweaters and skirts and scarves all winter long , assembling various color combinations . I saw that I could use men 's ties as scarves , not tying them tight around my neck but in any way I fancied . A bow tie can be knotted like a four-in-hand . A four-in-hand can be tied in a loose bow , or with just one loop and two ends . I told the salesman my idea at which he groaned loudly and said , " Miss Hawes , if you start wearing these ties , I will kill you . " " Why ? " ask I. " Because if you give the women ideas and they start wearing them the men wo n't buy them any more . " He was right , you know . Not altogether right but  | partly right . If women would start buying and wearing men 's ties from every possible source in the country , just the very men who have n't the gumption even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome with a terrible fear that maybe neckties were no longer manly and masculine . And the large mass of men who openly loathe wearing ties when it 's hot might be encouraged to do what numerous school and college boys do , namely , leave their collars open and tie their ties so the knot is below the opening . At least this gives them a little ventilation . Several young men I worked with on a coat-designing job wore clip-on bow ties . When they got to their shop they immediately removed their ties , opened their collars and clipped the tie onto a collar corner . The effect was quite delightful . And just to show the timorous this sort of thing goes on in all circles , a young social registerite I know who is in the army knotted all his ties in the prescribed fashion , cut off the part that was supposed to go around his neck , and then ran a piece of wire through the back of the knot . The two ends of the wire fasten under his shirt collar . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he obliterated four thicknesses of material under his collar . How extraordinarily silly it is that clip-on ties are thought by some to be very " lower class . " What a lot of snobbery there is in our great democracy . Is it a sign  | of that aristocracy , which we are n't supposed to have here , to wear four extra thicknesses of material about the neck ? Nonsense , gentlemen . A terrible flaw in a highly interesting book , The Second Sex , was that Mlle. de Beauvoir , after making an extremely well-documented case for women becoming as free as men , ended her book by saying that the men must free the women . Men can only encourage women . They can assist . But the women must free themselves . Women can go about asking men why they wear ties when ties are uncomfortable . They can say , " Why do n't you take your tie off , " or , " I wish you 'd stop wearing a tie in hot weather . " But so long as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties , then , heaven help them , they have to wear ' em . To be sure , if one man started to come to a conventional office in a sports shirt without a tie , the boss would undoubtedly send along word that ties were required in that office . But it is extremely doubtful that any boss would fire an entire staff if , in union , they found the strength to simply refuse to wear ties . A summer necktie sitdown is in order in these United States . And why not make it also a coat-removal strike ? There is nothing that shows up the timidity and unaggressiveness of our American males more than the fact that so many of them persist in wearing neckties and warm jackets in hot weather . If the U. S. A. , as some say , is in danger of turning into a matriarchy , it can happen only  | because most of the men are in reality mice . Perhaps they are aggressive in the dark with their neckties off , but even then , too often , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America . If your forefathers could get rid of George the Third , surely you can arrange the necktie situation as satisfactorily as the women 's hat situation has been arranged . Take them or leave them , but stop letting the necktie be your boss . Neckties ? Female . To wear something colorful up near the face unquestionably makes that face more appealing or radiant or gay . The female necktie can do what lipstick does ? brighten up the face ? in a far more original and individual way . Also , the necks of some older women become very scrawny and are more pleasing aesthetically when covered . I have mentioned the possible use of men 's ties to this end . But a piece of ribbon can do it , too . Remember the black velvet ribbon that used to be worn around so many elegant throats ? Or a colored handkerchief just big enough to knot is nice . Larger squares take more handling . A great many women believe they ca n't tie a scarf . But if they would experiment a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way they are getting better and better at tying that scarf , they 'd be able to tie it . Most scarves can be tied in a variety of ways .  | If you get a long scarf about eight inches wide and long enough to put one end over the other and then tuck the ends into your skirt , you 'll have something very slimming . You can put the loop up at the neck or lower down , between your breasts . The same scarf can be tied in a big bow . It can be twisted in the center for six or eight inches , which shortens it , and then tied in a knot . Any scarf that seems unmanageably large can be easily made smaller by just twisting the part that goes around the neck . It is easiest to work with a triangle about eighteen inches on the length and about twelve inches from the center of the length to the opposite point , or to work with a perfectly straight scarf about eight inches wide and three quarters of a yard long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around your neck . Try the knot on the side ; in the back ; with the ends together or with the ends pulled apart . Try tying it with one very short end , making one loop with the longer end . You just tie the very short end in a knot around the looped end . Now go get all those scarves you have been receiving for Christmas and putting away in a box , and start playing with them . You can always cut them in half if they are too big for you to arrange easily . Or consider tying anything at all around your neck that 's of a color and texture you like . There 's lots of fine cord and string . You can just knot the ends or put bells on them or but- tons . Stick a flower in the knot . If you 're inventive and not a sheep , you can make yourself endless neckties which can all be worn in a variety of ways . They can be fine attention-getters and conversation pieces as well as livener-uppers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , throw it in the wastebasket . I have so far in my life never met a living soul who felt she had to wear a scarf . Jewelry . There is only one piece of jewelry without which most American women over twenty-one feel lost . That is the wedding ring , and it ca n't properly be regarded as jewelry at all . It is the badge of success in a society which says that not to get your man is worse than death . The value of the engagement ring is a symbol of the dollar value of that man and therefore that ring ca n't be considered as jewelry . So few men wear wedding rings that sometimes it makes one almost uncomfortable to see one on a male finger . Society does not demand that a man be faithful to his wife , not really . Is this male wedding ring a true symbol of everlasting fidelity to a wife , or is it a sort of brand which warns : Private Property . Keep Off ? Anyway , it 's not jewelry . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious stone or made of glass or glazed . The vast majority of jewels worn today are of glass , some quite frankly , others  | simulating precious stones , so that no one but an expert can tell the difference . There is , let me assure you , absolutely no necessity for your fiance to go out and buy a real fifteen-carat diamond even if a part of the front you wish to present to the world is that he could afford it . We live in an age of synthetics ? including diamonds . Once I costumed a play whose characters included several very rich women . I bought and rented to the producer the very best imitations of precious jewelry : false diamonds and emeralds , mostly , set like precious jewels in white gold , which is seventy-five per cent gold mixed with nickel and zinc , and looks like platinum . When the show closed , the jewelry was mine . One night when I was going to a dinner party which I knew would be lush with real diamonds , I decided to wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat next to a man I 'd known for some years and who has spent his life surrounded by precious stones . Toward the end of dinner , I said to him , " How do you like my new ring ? " " It 's beautiful , " he said , something with which I did n't at all agree because if you really looked at it , it did n't have those iridescent stabbing lights going and coming as a real diamond does . " Where do you think I got it ? " Remember , he was a good friend of mine . " That , " he said frankly , and laughing , " is what I 've been wondering all evening . " He knew I did n't make that kind of money in my business and was n't the type  | to be receiving large diamonds from interested males . " Well , what did you decide ? " I inquired . " I decided you 'd turned in all your old jewelry and got one big ring . " Suddenly I realized that nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough on social occasions at a really splendid piece of imitation jewelry to detect whether it 's real or false . If you look hard enough you can tell , although usually the easy way to decide whether a woman is wearing real or imitation jewelry is to appraise her clothes . The shoes can tell . If they are really beautifully made , elegant , the jewels are apt to be real . But not necessarily . I certainly had on the most expensive clothing and accessories that night . Even my fake ring had cost around $150 , wholesale . I explained to the man how I got the ring . Then I started really using this ring . I did n't wear it socially as I do n't particularly care for this kind of jewelry , which can be very beautiful , but is still too often used as an ostentatious display of wealth when real ; and when false , it is too often being used to fool people . I used this ring particularly for getting favors when traveling by air . I used to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night , and often , if one was lucky , one could get at least two , if not all three , of a row of seats . That meant a good sound sleep . Or I would want to take something very large and breakable , which I had n't packed properly , into the plane cabin . There is  | always room for such things on planes where the coats are hung . One night , to the obvious rage of several other passengers , I not only got onto the plane before loading time with a porter carrying several large packages , but I also got three seats . This is how you do it : You dress very conservatively in the simplest of dark , plain clothes , including a small but nunlike hat . You put on plain opera pumps with middle height heels ; make sure your stocking seams are straight ; wear one of those make-ups which looks almost not made-up , and enough , but not too much , lipstick . Your nails must have a very good manicure but even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . Just well-kept nails . You carry a middle-sized very neat bag and wear a pair of snow-white gloves . The above is a description of the way most women who have names like Pratt , Rockefeller , Cabot , Lodge dress for travel . When you get to the ticket counter at the airport , you slip off your gloves in order to get out your airplane tickets . Then with a worried expression on your face , rub the fingers of your left hand up and down on your chin , with the ring toward the boys you 're going to have . to get on your side . The ring is the only jewelry you have on . It 's so large that if you had on a wedding ring , it would n't show . One of the boys comes over and you explain in a low voice that you had to leave in a great hurry , that no one had time to pack your things properly or to phone about  | getting them into the plane cabin , which , with a small smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , butlers , ladies ' maids come before the eyes of the boy at the ticket counter . He begins to wonder whether you are the wife of the president of the airline , but is already certain you are his boss 's best friend . " I 'm really terribly sorry to bother you this way , " you say softly and convincingly . The boy says just a minute and consults with someone who takes a good look at you without appearing to do so . If you have turned in a good performance , pretty soon the things you were too lazy to pack properly are in the plane and you are explaining to the hostess how terribly tired you are and you hate to bother her but does she know whether the plane is full . She is escorting you to the three seats you want and saying she ca n't promise but she hopes . If there are two adjourning empty seats next to your rightful one on that plane , you get them . Sit in the aisle side seat of the three you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarked . Without the diamond ring , it would never work . With two diamond rings , two clips , and four bracelets , it would n't work either . If you were the sort to wear that much real jewelry traveling , you can just bet the office would have phoned and arranged about the luggage . A man named Noel Coward once wrote a song called " Limehouse Blues . " It was about Poor Broken Blossom ,  | she 's nobody 's child , and went on to say something about : Rings on her fingers and tears for a crown , that is the tale of old Chinatown . It 's also the story of a lot of other Blossoms in a great many places outside Old Chinatown . And any time you get to thinking that using jewelry , real or false , to set yourself apart and gain special privilege is a good way of life , you 'll sure enough eventually have tears for a crown . It happened to me when airlines started assigning numbered seats on planes . Happily , the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woolworth 's . They wear all sorts of gilded-metal ornaments , sometimes encrusted with glass or glaze , which are often well designed and make not the slightest pretense to being anything but just what they are . This kind of jewelry , when it first appeared , was given the slang name " junk jewelry . " But those days are over . It is no longer considered " junk " merely because it costs so little . How much of it are you wearing ? Glittery things attract the eye . Are you making his eyes dart from one hand to another wrist to your ear to the other hand to your neck ? Supposing you are not distracting him or your friends in this fashion , have you thought where is the best place for you and on you to make them look ? One of the ten best-known society women in the world has something the matter with her which makes her fingernails break off . She can not , therefore , wear them with  | long sharp points . In her set this is pretty terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by wearing only a wedding ring and never wearing bracelets . She does n't want to attract attention to her hands . She wears earrings , necklaces , clips , pins , anything out of a vast assortment of precious jewelry which can be attached to herself or clothes down to her breasts , thereby distracting attention from her ignominious short-nailed fate . Now it might be that you have an unattractive bump on your cheek near one of your ears . Why wear earrings ? Or maybe your arms just go right on to your hands without any noticeable indentation at the wrist , which has apparently never been considered aesthetically pleasing to judge from even the most ancient of sculpture and painting . If you put bracelets around your wrist , everyone is going to notice the wrist . Maybe you do n't care at all . Maybe you do . Maybe you have an extremely thick neck or a small goiter . Why do you wear a necklace to point to it ? This is all your business , but if you will take a good look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing , perhaps your shell-like ears , you can then make a specialty of drawing attention in the proper direction and to your best bodily feature . In any case , I most heartily suggest you do not distract your audience by an overabundance of jewelry , real or otherwise . A queen , when called upon to appear as a  | symbol of the wealth of her empire , may have to be loaded down with jewels . On anyone else , similar loading makes people feel the wearer is possessed by her possessions , money-precious , or preciously necessary to bolster her self-assurance . Not feeling her Self attractive or important enough , instead of just highlighting some part of herself , the bejeweled woman attempts to create an important , sparkling personality by turning into a Christmas tree . Of course , if you like to be disguised as a Christmas tree and are getting just what you want out of life , you will continue to wear multitudinous glittery objects . Fine . But watch out , as time goes on , that the glittering objects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying and falling from the branches . How revolting it can be to glance at some flashing rings and have one 's eyes slide immediately to fleshy , pudgy hands , or to weak , spindly-fingered ones , unable to do a thing but put on the ornamentation . If you 're a man , I rather hope you have on a large , precious-jeweled ring because that is considered by many of those women who constantly wear quite a lot of jewelry to be " in very bad taste " ( for a man ) . Our grandfathers wore quite flashy stickpins , now out of style or in " bad taste . " But who says so and who cares ? The addiction of men to wide gold wrist-watch straps is clearly an indication of the fact that they , too , would often like to brighten up the corner where they are with some  | glitter . Perhaps , soon , American men will develop enough self-love to spend some of the jewelry money in their family on themselves . Why Are Your Accessories ? Many of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take them all off in the undressing process and have a good look at them . Find out first whether they are indeed accessories or have become you , and if so , why . The collar pin : are you afraid your collar will fall off ? The tie pin : because the tie gets out from under your coat and falls in the soup ? The bunch of sables around your neck with the temperature at eighty . The tiny bejeweled wrist watch so small you ca n't possibly tell the time from it . The dog on that leash you hold in your hand . Is it your best friend , a good friend , or an accessory ? The man or woman by your side . Merely an accessory ? Even your children : are n't many children viewed as accessories ? To some people everybody and everything is an accessory , the world subordinated to themselves . These are the very people who are most apt to find it necessary to endow themselves , oftener and oftener , with more and more worldly accessories . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Alvin Johnson , that interesting silver-haired founder of New York 's New School for Social Research , and we were agreeing how awful most of the women around us in the restaurant looked , he said , " It 's not that I 'm against make-up . But when Cleopatra used it she had dozens of people entirely occupied with mixing up exactly what she wanted . And the way she applied it was an art . " Make-up in the United States is in a deep rut and it 's been that way for a long time . Women 's clothes have vastly improved in design and the choice has broadened immeasurably , but make-up has remained stupid and boring . Day after day , year after year , American females put almost identical masks on their faces like an army of robots . It 's high time for the American woman to un- dress her face and make a thorough inquiry into the cosmetic facts of life . Why do women wear lipstick ? It is n't primarily to please men . If it were an essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dislike lipstick . Most men simply accept it . They did n't demand that women wear it , but they put up with it as another foible of the female sex . Many men prefer their women with lipstick . It makes a girl colorful , they say . A girl need n't have wits , natural vivacity , a colorful personality . Just wear lipstick , deeer . The first and most essential ingredient of make-up today is , however , lipstick . Little girls often start smearing it on , from time to time , beginning at age three or four . ( If your little girl wants to , for heaven 's sake let her . Maybe she 'll either be cured of it by the time she grows up or will manage to develop some new way to use it . ) A great many women say they would " be lost " without lipstick . Pause a minute and think that over . What does such a remark really reveal ? I remember one time when Ingrid Bergman came into New York in a hurry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview . I kept thinking it did n't matter in the least what clothes she wore because the sight of her with no lipstick and her hair simply brushed was sufficient to stop the American press dead any time . Of course , the American craze for lipstick will go by the boards one of these days . The time always comes  | when the advance guard suddenly takes a look around and realizes they are doing what everyone else is doing and either it bores them , or they know they can attract more attention by defying the majority rule . But how defy it ? The courage it takes ! A friend of mine had a very amusing experience leaving off her lipstick . It serves to show that , should you be among those whose man dislikes lipstick , or among those women who dislike it , or just want to stop looking like everyone else , you better make sure you can withstand pressure from practically everyone before you take up natural lips . My friend Alice is a jewelry designer , works for a large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was working on a study of what women 's magazines and the advertisers therein keep telling women to do , I remarked to Alice that to read the cosmetic ads you 'd think no woman without lipstick could ever get a man . She said : " Really I 've always loathed the stuff and I do n't know why I wear it . " It so happened that the very next night one of her favorite men suddenly looked at her very intently . After the look , he asked : " Why do you , of all people , wear lipstick ? " Alice said she did n't really know except that she 'd been wearing it so long her lips were utterly pallid without it . To wear lipstick is very like keeping a Band-Aid constantly on a certain place . The skin under- neath gets bleached from lack of light . So the outside skin of one 's lips becomes a sort of pale gray . Alice went off to the country for two months . She removed her lipstick and got her lips back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town nobody but her intimate friends noticed for quite a while that she had on no lipstick . The boss 's wife , some time later , noticed Alice 's cultural aberration and took the subject up with her husband . He at once called Alice on the office phone . " I understand you are n't wearing lipstick , " he said . She admitted to the fact . " Well , put it on at once . This is a fashion business we run and you ca n't go around without lipstick . " " How many times have you seen me in the last month ? " Alice inquired . The boss did n't know . It was plenty of times . He 'd never noticed she was n't wearing lipstick . She offered to quit , was refused , and the matter was dropped . Alice has n't worn any lipstick for about five years now . It has n't deprived her of men friends , on the contrary , it rather tends to attract the type she likes . Several of her women friends have fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of boredom for a conversation piece , and sometimes a good laugh . One day , an extremely socially correct and kindly woman , intent on being motherly , told Alice she had forgotten to  | put on her lipstick . When Alice said she never wore it , the woman exclaimed : " How very courageous of you , my dear . " Occasionally the information seeps through the underground , from Paris or the Riviera or Capri , that chic women in Europe have removed their make-up . Either the cosmetic manufacturers keep the news out of the papers , or all public reporters of such interesting nonsense know it 's false . In this day and age any time you hear the international set has removed its make-up you may be sure what they are really doing is varying the monotony of their lives by making up so no one can tell they 've done it . A good many women practice this in all or part of their make-up . It 's a high art . Elsa Lanchester , Charles Laughton 's wife , confided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up her eyes so they look further apart and so that nobody will know she ever touches them . After a press showing of my made-to-order clothes , I snickered when I read a piece in the paper by Gilbert Seldes , he of the Seven Lively Arts , in which he solemnly said I wore no make-up . It was an evening party I gave and I 'd been pretty tired . Only I knew that I 'd spent a good fifty minutes in making up so that I 'd give the illusion of no make-up . Like this : Put on a careful , thick , pancake make-up , any shade not too far removed from that of your arms . Pat it dry and powder your face thoroughly and thickly . Take some- thing similar to honey and almond cream and pat it very lightly , gently and thinly , all over your face . You now look as if you had a lovely , smooth , unpowdered complexion . If you have n't too many deep wrinkles and lines they will have been filled in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like baby oil , on the tips of your fingers , very little , and lightly touch the tip of your nose , the tip of your chin , the upper part of your cheekbones , and your forehead on either side at the top . Highlight the protruding parts of your face , in other words . Lo and behold , you will now have that washed , fresh , healthy , nomake-up look . You will have so much stuff on your face that after a couple of hours it is best either to go home , or keep out of bright lights since lines and wrinkles become more and more evident as time passes when you have on a really thick make-up . Put mascara very thinly on only your outer top eyelashes and make sure it graduates into the unpainted ones . Get a so-called " natural " shade lipstick , like Tangee , and paint your mouth thoroughly along its natural lines . Then wipe off all the lipstick . All of it . Your lips , perhaps formerly pale with fatigue or gray from constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pinkish color . If anyone at the party suggests you have on lipstick , just wipe your lips as hard as you can with the back of your hand and show them that nothing comes off . Even so-called indelible lipstick ca n't stand this test . For  | heaven 's sake , remember to wash your face before you go to bed . Quite a long time ago I happened to see a very fine book full of reproductions of Indian heads in war paint . I 'd always thought make-up in the U.S.A. was rather dull and it suddenly occurred to me how very marvelous it would be if women really made themselves up for ceremonial occasions . Rich American women could hire fine modern painters to design make-up which would be put on with the colors available for theatrical make-up , blues , pinks , browns , anything that suits their mood , and make a sort of wonderful weird mask painted on the face . The thing that had started Elsa Lanchester telling me about making up her eyes so they would n't look made up was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had unfolded this great new make-up idea to them . When I finished there was a prolonged silence and then Charles said , " You are , you know , trying to make a revolution in the United States . " I was dumfounded but interested . The war came along just then , so I had n't time to find out about whether a revolutionary make-up could provoke a revolution . But the idea stuck in my head and after the war I did a piece for a magazine on the subject , which I illustrated by drawing my own designs on picture stills of movie actresses ' faces . They looked so extraordinary and really fine that the magazine had me decorate a live model and took a color picture for the cover . The piece caused  | no end of comment . But nothing happened . No revolution . I have seen not one woman going about in war paint , nor have I heard even a single revolutionary and rebel yell from among my fellow American females . But if they will now undress their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make-up . Many psychiatrists say the use of make-up is a " flight from reality . " These psychiatrists believe that any advance in civilization is marked by an ever increasing ability to face things as they are , not to deny the actualities of your own body or those of the external world . Certainly the way most women use make-up today is extremely unrealistic . Havelock Ellis told about the gift of a pair of stockings to a royal bride . The donor was rebuked by the court chamberlain for what were held to be the indecent implications of his gift , with the words : " The Queen of Spain has no legs . " The way things are in the make-up department , you 'd think few American females over fifteen had faces of their own . Their goal and desire is to be made-up as identically as possible with all other American female faces . The use of make-up in the United States may once have been a sign of greater freedom of the female , but it seems today to have become a symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no woman who works in any business remotely connected with fashion , except its manufacture ,  | would be permitted to go without some make-up on her job , especially lipstick . If the question arose , lipstick would be found a " must " for the vast majority of socalled white-collar women workers . If you 're a working girl who dislikes lipstick , you 'd better think hard before you abandon it . You may be accused of trying to start a revolution , or you may lose your job . If , as you undress your face , you find the feel and bother of lipstick , and the fact it comes off on napkins and water glasses , forks and men 's clothes , annoy you sufficiently , you 'll decide to take some action . You may get away with it if you proceed as follows : Transfer to a " natural " lipstick . This is more like lip salve than lipstick and looks orange in the stick but turns a sort of pinkish-red on the lips . Use a good deal at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on and then wiping off all but the dye . Whether or not you continue to use your natural lipstick at all will depend on the general state of your health . Gray lips are rather unattractive , to put it mildly . I have often thought , while studying the faces of women in our crowded cities , that in town only the rich should make-up in the daytime ? women who ride in cars , take taxis , walk merely for a bit of exercise and who have plenty of leisure time and opportunity to completely renew their masks when the make-up gets a bit worn . A really smoothly made-up woman is rarely seen powdering or lipsticking in public , dabbing new over old  | make-up . She makes up her undressed face at home , thoughtful of the length of time she will be out and just how long her make-up will last . Mr. Watson 's sign THINK , which hangs everywhere throughout the International Business Machines establishments , might profitably be placed over the make-up mirrors of America . For the woman who ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be out a long time on a job or shopping , it is suicide to use a lot of cosmetics . As the powder base dries , the powder falls off and the dust settles . Adding another layer of powder is what makes people wish you 'd go somewhere ? anywhere ? and wash your face . New lipstick over old makes your mouth messy-looking . If you feel make-up is absolutely essential at all times , then you 'd better get very realistic about how you put what on when . You should look at yourself in all lights , especially including sunlight , and keep looking at yourself off and on all day until you 've discovered some way of making up which does n't fizzle out on you , like a bottle of opened soda , hours before you can completely renew it . And if you want to get very realistic about everyday make-up , go a step further and consider why you use it and why so much of it . The very young , when not plagued by nerves , have nice fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't take advantage of this fine thing by using no make-up . Of course , the American  | publicists urge them to make-up . It 's to the advantage of our advertising media and the cosmetic manufacturers that the females of the species take to make-up as early as possible and that its use be continued until the last lipstick is applied by the mortician 's make-up man . Nowadays the mothers of many young girls urge them to make-up , even demand it sometimes . There is a considerable amount of strongly concealed jealousy felt by older women toward the young , especially by mothers toward daughters . It is silly not to admit what certain psychologists affirm : the propaganda which causes all American women to make-up results in a certain leveling between the young and the old . The older women cut their competition by helping foist lipstick and powder on the young females . The young are pushed thoughtlessly into making up without being given a chance to consider they are being adroitly maneuvered into giving up the big advantage their fresh natural complexions give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the normal human course of existence , has become flabby and wrinkled , whose coloring has paled , they are often quite hideous with their bright red lips and powder and rouge which seems embarrassed to be on their cheeks and is ever trying to get away , standing off slightly from their skin . It may be a long time before youth and beauty in our country cease to be more highly prized than brains and experience , but , meanwhile , trying to preserve youth and beauty with  | cosmetics is often aesthetically worse than death . A colorful scarf or ribbon may prove a more graceful livenerupper for the fading female . No , I 'm not trying to take away all your make-up . I 'm just trying to make you stop using it as if there were a law requiring it , and start thinking about make-up in relation to your own life and face . Making up was never thought of as an essential of every day life for the total female population until American mass production came into being . American women have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they feel like it . It 's about time they dropped the whole thing , or evaluated their making up in the light of the fact it can be an art and should be a personalized one , and that Cleopatra did n't go to work or out shopping in a filthy dusty city . If you have any pretensions to being an individual rather than a mass female , the most startling way to point up that individuality is simply to go about with a clean face , an undressed face . But if making up is a form of fine fun for you , get yourself a theatrical make-up outfit : colored sticks , fancy grease paint , and go mad with it . Temper the madness until you develop something that is slightly different and marks you as an individual among millions of your fellow women . There 's one woman I know in Chicago who puts a blue pencil line about a half inch long out from the corner of each eye . It 's a very small thing , takes no time , and is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't thought up four or five such simple tricks so she could vary her effects . Since we are free to paint our faces , why do n't we make them into works of art , humorous or serious , when an occasion like a party or any ceremony offers ? We can decorate ourselves practically for our work and playfully and artfully when we play . And how about undressing the fingernails ? Have you faced the fact that red nail polish is no longer really the thing ? Are you very courageously leaving it on , or did you very courageously never use it at all , or have you very courageously replaced it with something else ? After some two decades of bloody-red fingernails , after practically every young woman and many older ones had adopted them , those who were using them for an attention-getting device realized that red claws were n't working any more . The red fingernail had become acceptable to the point that nobody noticed it . So the avant-garde attention-seekers began replacing their red polish with pale pink polish , or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The advantage of wearing deeply colored nail palish is that you never have to clean your fingernails . If you are wearing it , no doubt you can think of many other reasons for your using it . It keeps your spirits up , you may say . A good reason , but , oh , dear , just how sad can life get ? Your men like red polish ? This does n't agree with my poll . Do you work for a fashion magazine that  | sent out an edict that its employees were not to give up their red polish as long as the advertisers advertised it ? Red or whatever color , why are you wearing your fingernails a quarter inch , more or less , longer than your finger at the point ? The long fingernail is , of course , symbolic of not having to do any heavy work with the hands . Page the ancient Chinese . They really did develop ways of publicly showing they were n't coolies . To be sure , American women have to do a good deal of manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badges of idleness . Perhaps they are attempting to elongate their fingers because there is a superstition abroad to the effect that long thin fingers , like long thin feet , are more aristocratic than any other type . There is another , less well known school of thought , which believes people actually develop long thin fingers when it is their nature to grasp after things . Why are your teeth so long , Grandmother ? The better to bite you , my dear . It seems to me fingernails are only useful when they are just about the length and shape of the end of the finger , a bit longer than most men wear them . In that case one can often use them , without breaking them , to do important things like removing those awful extra covers on the tops of liquor bottles in the absence of a knife . They become , in effect , a rather dull but handy blade , ineffective for scratching people bloodily , but useful in minor ways when lacking tools . Long nails are obviously useful to many animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of what earthly use are long fingernails to us today when we have knives , guns , bombs and tongues which can scourge . As to red toenails , there has been the theory that when wearing open sandals in a city in the summer the paint conceals the dirt . This is totally phony . In practice , the paint calls attention to the feet and they are often so filthy , especially the edge of the skin around the toenail , that the less attention they get the better . However , feet are more easily washed than stockings , and what 's a little dirt compared to the coolness and comfort of no stockings ? But why the red toenails ? I myself find them rather nice . They do n't make me think of anything unpleasant the way red fingernails do . If a person feels gayer for wearing them , why not ? It seems to me any serious consideration of the use of so-called cosmetics in the United States indicates that most women wish to appear about the same age as all other women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of universal American make-up will create this illusion . There is less variation in make-up among women than in any other branch of dressing . The present use of it is essentially a flight from reality , which is why so many women get so angry if one starts discussing make-up .  | Permanents Rule The Waves LET 'S TAKE our hair down . Men first . The way the majority of men arrange their hair is very little trouble to them . They find some barber who suits them and get their hair cut once in so often , brush it a little , comb it into place maybe three times a day . They wash it and apply a little tonic of some kind when necessary . Some of them complicate their lives by using stickum . As far as I can make out there is little dissatisfaction among men with the present social requirements concerning hairdos . There is , however , a kind of dull uniformity about the male coiffure despite the fact that one man parts it here , another there , and some not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you men wore it longer . It would be interest-  | ing if we could see a sprinkling of Puritan Fathers ' haircuts , and pirate hair tied back with a ribbon , and more male hair allowed to be naturally curly . If men felt themselves free to dress as they pleased , there would surely be a wider variation in the way they fix their hair . It 's beards that cause trouble for a lot of men . One young man remarked to me that he thought having to shave every day was a worse curse than the monthly one of the female . I have no reason to dissent . One is merely a slight inconvenience to any healthy woman . The other is perpetually with the male . If you ask men why they do n't grow beards , they will tell you they would itch , implying they 'd be dirty . Yet , men manage to live perfectly happily without shaving their heads . Let 's assume there is some sound reason for men not to wear beards . Still , there is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnecessary male shaving . Why should n't men be permitted to go unshaven if they like , when some outside force like a boss is n't making it absolutely necessary ? There are very pleasurable sensations to be had by a female from a male 's rather scratchy beard . A stiff brush is great for a massage , but a beard is better . Obviously , women would accustom themselves happily to men 's beards if men wanted to wear them . But if beards are really unbearable to the bearded ones , the sensible thing to do would be to start breeding beardless men . I have no doubt something could be invented which  | would permanently dispose of the roots of the hair . They can , of course , be removed by electrolysis . But it hurts . I expect that if anyone discovered a sound method of permanently disposing of the beard , most men would not care to use it . We do n't mutilate our bodies very much compared to so-called primitive tribes , who , among other things , cut off their teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorate their bodies by scarring them , shave their heads in fantastic fashion . Our feet are somewhat pinched , and often permanently disfigured . But , for the most part , our only acts of what anthropologists call " mutilation " are shaving or otherwise dehairing armpits , legs , eyebrows , and chins , and the cutting of our nails . These are not permanent forms of " mutilation " since hair grows back , and nails continue to grow and would break off anyway if not cut . The last serious mutilation of the human body in the U.S.A. vanished with the waspwaisted corset . We shall probably live to see the day when , having uncovered legs and armpits , women no longer find it necessary to endeavor to prove their complete femininity by being hairless except for the hair on their heads and on the mount of Venus , which , as we are about to consider the female 's hair , raises an interesting question . I have never thought to take a poll on the number of bleached blondes who also dye their Venus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether one will endeavor to make the blondeness complete or have a piebald ap- pearance in the nude . How many women give to this most sex-appealing of all hair the tender care they do to the hair on their heads ? How simple life is for those women who have found some way , which pleases them , of leaving the hair on their heads in a state of nature , tying it up pony fashion , pulling it together and out of the way , in an active life , with some sort of comb or barrette or three hairpins . Or perhaps interfering with nature only to the extent of cutting some hair off . The increase in casual ways of fixing hair , and wearing hair straight , unquestionably presages more widespread originality in female coiffures . By now , everyone has had a permanent , can have one , or , thank heaven , does n't want one . It 's terrible , since the advent of the permanent wave , how extraordinary alike most women 's hairdos are . The hair is short , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , or it is smooth on top , parted somewhere , and the ends curled rather flatly in an even line at the lower extremity . With all the latitude women could allow themselves , the vast majority display practically no originality in their hairdressing . And goodness knows it 's not the men who are stopping , or starting , anything in this department . It ca n't be that American men in reality have as little interest as they express in the arrangement of women 's hair . A man must have preferences as to the dressing of his own woman 's hair , unless he has completely lost in- terest in her and she is merely his wife . American men are a rather downtrodden group as far as getting what they want from their women in the costume department goes . I know it is not considered " manly " in our country for men to have much knowledge of , or feelings about , female adornment . But , as it is manly in other countries , and sometimes here , it seems likely too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long period for expressing themselves , so the men now look , listen , but do not speak . Or maybe this sad condition came about because men as a group have so little leisure compared to women , and they do not care to waste this leisure considering women 's costumes . But , in the case of hair , which is ever present , surely they must have opinions . How many of you women have lately asked : My dear , would you prefer my hair long ? Do you mind these bobby pins I use in public which look as if I 'd forgotten to fix my hair since going to bed ? Shall I find a way to do my hair so I do n't have to go to bed in curlers at night ? Shall I dye my hair , or would you rather I 'd let it turn gray ? Shall I try my hair straight and see how you like it ? For whom is the lady dressing her hair ? Or undressing it . For the hairdresser ? Her best female friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Least of all , I 'd say , for the latter . Surely it was the women who decided to cut off their hair . After World War I , the women of the Western  | world and especially American women set out to be " free . " That they had been pretty much locked in the home and deprived of the right to take part in world , national , or even civic , events is a historic fact . But that they felt they should bind their breasts , cut their skirts off to the knee , and clip off their hair was a question of deciding that being " free " meant being " men . " It was a highly logical deduction in a man 's world and one from which we have not yet recovered fully . It seems to be very convenient , freer , for a woman to have short hair . It would be very convenient if all it involved was cutting it off periodically , like a man . But most young ladies and many older ones seem never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originated as " bobbed " hair . Equally as surely as the women decided without consulting the men that they would cut their hair , so it was they who originally decided they should almost all have curly hair . There is a kind of very fine soft hair which is extremely difficult to arrange in most approved modern ways without benefit of a permanent . And there are a great many women who feel that curly hair is far more becoming than straight hair . So long as they feel more attractive , more socially secure with curled hair , then they should certainly have it . But it is rather sad that one 's attraction and security should have to be secured by artificial means . Any honest person must admit that love , passion , and the family continued for aeons without  | benefit of curls or waves . There are a great many women who would be far more distinguished-looking if they would find some method of wearing their hair straight . If , during this undressing period , we could only by magic get our hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut or curled , then at least in the privacy of our own rooms we could consider what might be done with it . Most men would n't give a thought to radically changing their hairdressing habits . But if a woman really wants to start fresh , she can make quite a nice thing of calmly letting her permanent or the dye just grow out . A marvelous woman I worked with in Paris had hair which , for years , she dyed a sort of reddish-chestnut . One season she decided to stop dyeing it and created quite a sensation over a period of months as she went calmly about with more and more inches of very beautiful white hair above the reddish-chestnut . If you will let your hair grow out , then you can spend some time trying it this way and that before you decide whether to cut it , or curl it , or maybe dye it . In the final analysis nobody can figure out how you should fix your hair but yourself . The average hairdresser will persistently arrange , perhaps cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not suit you at all . If you are going to go around picking your hair styles from ads or magazines , you have to be sure your face is the shape of the advertising model 's and that you have the type of hair to be fixed that way , or the whole thing may be a terrible  | fiasco . If you look very critically at pictures of hairdos , or those on your friends or enemies , or on movie stars , you can fairly well judge , after a little practice , whether you and your hair are sufficiently like what you 'd like to copy to succeed . If you are really searching for inspiration , go to the library and look in some books of historical costume . You have also to decide whether , even if you could do your hair a certain way , the general effect goes along with your behavior . A complicated hairdo on a rather simple young girl can look as foolish as would Queen Elizabeth in a page-boy cut . If you 're the type who goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a cap , goes hatless even in high winds , then unless you wish to look a mess , you have to fix your hair so it stays , come hell or high jinks . Perhaps some women could n't do it , but a certain number cut their own hair . For quite a few years , after I got completely sick of sitting in a hairdresser 's chair ( not to mention the sums of money it cost ) I used to cut the front of my hair and leave the back long , putting it up or tying it together with a ribbon , as the spirit moved me . Lately I 've taken to cutting the back . It is easy if you use a triple mirror . Otherwise you take a hand mirror in your right hand ( if you 're right-handed ) and survey the back of your head in another mirror . You carefully select a wisp of hair that wants shortening , take it in your left hand , put down the mirror , take up the scissors and cut  | off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can always cut more hair tomorrow , but you ca n't put it back on . There is no sound rule whatsoever for the way any woman " should " arrange her hair other than that it accord with her own idea of what is attractive for her and that it stay put for as long a period as she will be absent from home , or removed from a ladies ' room . The minute someone produces an idea that if your head is narrow on top and your jaw broad below , you should fix your hair so it sticks out on the sides above your ears and thus create an illusion your jaw tapers ? because this is said to be more attractive ? the minute anyone gets up such an idea , or any similar type of notion , you invariably walk right out on the street and run into one of the most attractive women you 've ever seen who has her hair skinned back tight over a head with the narrowest top you ever saw and above a perfectly square jaw . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars of stage and screen , and otherwise . They were women who could afford to spend whatever was necessary to solve any sartorial problem . Off and on I would send a hair-harassed woman to my hairdresser , Michael , at the Waldorf . I sent them there because I knew Michael would never assist them in working out any hair arrangement which did n't suit their hair and lives . Several times my customers from out of town went to him and requested he do their hair in the current  | New York fashion . He would always refuse if it was a fashion they could not arrange for themselves , and if he knew they 'd never find a home-town hairdresser who could do it properly . Among the women I 've dressed there were no distinguished ones , no really attractive ones , who did n't work out for themselves the way they wanted their hair to look , perhaps with a hairdresser arranging it .

Perhaps it is a fine thing for young ladies , if they want , to dye their hair . The young and the fresh can get away with practically anything . On the other hand , apparently , it is quite difficult to dye hair so it does n't turn out looking like metal . If your hair is mouse color maybe that makes you feel like a mouse . If you do n't wish to feel that way and brightening it up cures you , then it should be dyed . There 's certainly nothing wrong with dyeing your hair if it really makes you more attractive .

Droopy elbows can be spotted at more than fifty paces . The United States is the worst country in the world for trying to convince a woman that after she is forty , or even before , she is dead . But when the muscles start sagging , as they will sometimes no matter how much exercise anyone gets , when the hair starts losing its original color and silvering off , then is not the time to start dyeing it unless you can go continually to the most expert person in the whole world who can make your hair a color and texture which is as beautiful as an angel 's and as flattering , as soft and as becoming . I do n't know of anyone who can do that , or who can dye hair so as to make it harmonize with the texture of an older woman 's skin .

More American men and women than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wearing no underwear is still rather like petting : It 's okay so long as no one who 's against it finds out it 's being done . When people who consider underwear a necessity are pressed for reasons why , they are , in my experience , most likely to produce at least the following answers : Everybody needs underwear to keep their outer clothes clean ; and sometimes because fabrics are itchy . Women wear skirts , and so must wear something in the nature of under- pants , and most women have to wear brassieres and some sort of girdle . Let me knock down all these reasons and a few more . In the case of the vast majority a completely new attitude toward underwear will have to emerge if they are ever to feel themselves perfectly dressed . If a person does n't wear underwear his outer clothes will get dirty , is quite a fabulous statement in our day and age . The enormous preoccupation of our citizenry with cleanliness has often been noted by psychologists and foreigners . This phobia , which so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be based on the prodigious amount of advertising making cleanliness practically more important than Godliness . The ads would fall on deaf ears and blind eyes if people were n't educated from birth to believe them . When United Statesians are babies and toddlers they are regularly condemned , if not punished , for having their enjoyable bowel movements where they can get the most pleasure out of them and for wetting their beds , wetting themselves , and wetting other people , although some psychologists believe babies only wet people they like . The punishment for wetting is the beginning of learning one must be clean . One 's most enjoyable pursuits are called dirty , disgusting and smelly . The pattern continues as long as the subject is interested in playing with mud and dirt . Childhood pursuits almost all involve getting dirty . And that is called bad by mothers .  | People who are n't brought up to think it 's vile for children to get dirty are had at by advertisers in another way . The ads try to make you believe that if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be socially ostracized . This is about as compelling an argument for producing cleanliness phobias as being told from birth that all natural bodily odors and half the important bodily functions are disgusting , including sex . Innumerable well-groomed men and women wear certain kinds of clothes off and on for weeks , or even months , without having them cleaned or washed . The clothes are quite clean enough to arouse no complaints from their most fastidious friends . These clothes have often been protected from the female wearer 's skin only by a brassiere and a small pair of pants and from the male skin only by underpants . The chief worry over keeping the body away from clothes so as not to dirty them is taken care of by the underpants . Why is that ? Is one part of the body actually any less clean than another now that we have deodorants and ample washing facilities ? Of course not . It is merely that most of us have been taught evacuating and having sexual intercourse are dirty and we therefore dream up the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dirty even though well washed and healthy . The average person 's clothes will require some sort of cleaning from dirt accumulated on the outside a hundred times sooner than  | from being next to the person 's skin , with the exception , of course , of clothes worn when one is perspiring like mad , and then the amount of underclothing worn is no protection to the clothes as far as their over-all cleanliness goes . Women wear skirts . Yes , short skirts which can blow and all that . The most intimate part of the female anatomy might be exposed if not well covered . It might , but it would be a very , very rare thing . The most exquisitely dressed of my customers wear silk lingerie from France , or made elsewhere along similar lines . What covers these ladies ' intimate parts is a kind of flared skirt about the length of a pair of short shorts , thin and lacey or embroidered . The little skirt is joined together between their legs in one fashion or another for about two inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , or should the ladies lounge around very much , as women do in slacks , little would be left to the onlooker 's imagination . This type of underpants is certainly very desirable lingerie , but it is good for absolutely nothing but its decorative and alluring quality and the fact it is very delicious to feel silk against the skin . If women who wear this kind of lingerie have no difficulty preserving their respectability in public , neither do women who go about their business wearing no underpants . Of course , some women do n't wear pants under shorts and often wear none under slacks . Most women have to wear brassieres . Kindly think  | that over from an historical point of view . Today most women think they must wear brassieres . Although I think it is fair to say all men would prefer women not to have to wear brassieres . A man friend of mine told me he went to his manicurist one day and found her in a real rage . She had just been to see her daughter , age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And what do you suppose she had gone and done ? " the manicurist said , practically sobbing . " She 's put on a brassiere . I told her if she did n't take it off for good , I 'd take her out of school and have her live with me , so I could make sure she did n't ruin her figure . " A whole generation of women completely ruined their pectoral muscles , broke them down deliberately , by binding their breasts after World War I in order to have that boyish form which was to help make them free . The brassiere is an invention of some devil who hates wellformed young women . The strapless brassiere with bones to the waist is calculated to dig holes in you , and anyone who is wearing a strapless brassiere without bones and feeling good about it certainly does n't need a brassiere at all . One of my customers who did n't need a bra at all was rather recalcitrant about removing it . She 'd got the habit of that constant hugged feeling about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom properly hugged these days , they stick to brassieres as the next best thing ? The customer in question was little hugged by her hus- band , that 's for sure . She wanted an evening dress which was off the shoulders , old-Southern-charm type . With this she could n't wear a bra with straps , so off she went and invested $35 in a boned strapless number . After we 'd zipped her into it in the fitting room she gave that sort of wiggle all women who really wear clothes well do when they get them on , to settle them into place . " My God , Elizabeth , " she said . " This certainly was n't made for necking . " ( P. S. Madame decided she did n't need a bra , first not with evening clothes , later not at all . ) One of those women who is so attractive there are always six men near her panting a little , a woman about fifty-five , whose name mostly everyone knows , has rather small but quite pendulous breasts . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the slight sway of her breasts under the folds of material is most seductive . If your breasts hang down , and practically everyone 's do to some extent , and you have the rare courage to remove your bras completely , wear loose-topped clothes like the lady . Get your sweaters several sizes " too big , " and if you wear men's-type shirts , be sure they are also very loose . After a while you will get less self-conscious about not looking like that surreelle character in the brassiere ad and can wear tight tops when you feel like it . I recently made a short speech on brassieres along the above lines to a gentleman of my acquaintance and he fell into a real rage . He said I should have more sense  | than to think the women of America wanted to look like African natives , or that their men wanted them to . I was delighted he got so outraged because from now on I am sure he will give serious consideration to the matter of women 's breasts and the treatment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breasts , or what she does about them , is none of my business . All I 'd like to see is fewer American breasts quite needlessly looking as if they were cast in concrete . Women must wear girdles ! That 's the edict . Ugh ! How about the way women look in those satin and elastic things which should be called chastity belts , the kind that are underpants and girdle in one and supposed to make you so smooth in outer clothes . That 's one of the kinds of girdles that have turned this age into what males who use their eyes call " the one buttock era . " I 'd like to see a woman get out of one of those things gracefully . Then will she please immediately wash away all that dead perspiration and try to obliterate as fast as possible the pattern of the seams and elastic from her flesh . Even then , unless she is doing stomach exercises day and night and rolling around on a hard floor like mad on her fanny , if she 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't have to look at her to know her buttocks and stomach are as flabby as her breasts . Some women get into girdles when they are young and slim and hard and for a while no noticeable change  | takes place . The muscles break down slowly . The woman has a couple of kids . Her husband has a couple of secretaries who do n't wear girdles , or who are still not broken down from same . Well , anyway , the wasp-waisted corset is gone . The old-fashioned whaleboned corset is gone . And I do not hesitate to predict that all girdles will have disappeared by the year 2000 except when needed by the physically ill . Older women I 've dressed who had never worn girdles felt no need of them and have infinitely better figures than those who had worn corsets . Underwear is necessary because some materials are itchy , so I 'm told . There are now enough fabrics which do n't make anyone itch , so that this reason for wearing underwear could be obliterated in a hurry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fabrics in the clothes they buy . There has to be something highly psychological about being " itched " by some fabrics . It happens only to a minority of people . How is it the Scots who wear their kilts without underpants are n't itched by the wool ? It 's certain this itching exists , but I noted with interest that a young man I know who kept refusing to wear flannel pants because they " itched " him was presented by someone he admired very much with a beautiful pair of British gray flannel Daks ( those marvelous trousers with adjustable waistbands ) , and this pair of trousers did n't make him itch at all . It seems probable to me that some people who itch from wool  | were too much covered with it when they were little , got hot and sweaty and itchy , and later the mere feel or thought of wool produced the same effect . In any case , the itch does n't seem a reason for keeping underwear on most people . I have now endeavored to obliterate everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garter belt , used to hold up stockings , and the slip and the petticoat . Now to knock these off in the order named . I expect by the year 2000 , when the girdle and its garters will have disappeared , stockings will have evaporated so no means of holding them up will be necessary . Practically no women wear stockings in warm weather any more and a certain number never wear them . To be sure , they paint their legs to make them look tan , and stockings are now so sheer one would never know whether a person had them on or not except for the seams , so one hardly notices bare legs in winter . Painting legs is a nuisance , but maybe the fair white leg will become acceptable again . Clearly stockings are n't necessary for warmth in average cold weather , or thousands , maybe millions , of bobby soxers would have perished . When a woman now finds it absolutely necessary to keep her legs warm , she wears trousers . It will be marvelous when stockings disappear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to mention its uncomfortable qualities . There is something so repulsive about all brassieres , girdles , garter belts that if  | women really cared how they looked as they undressed , they 'd throw them all away . What a farce all this dressing to be madly attractive is when removing the outer layer reveals so many artificial and aesthetically displeasing means to the end . Slips and petticoats are worn sometimes to prevent the itch which I admit to have left hanging in mid-air . They are also worn to prevent men from " seeing through " women in thin dresses , which are , in turn , often chosen because the wearer believes she feels cooler in them . I can say from long experimentation that a dress thin enough to make its wearer feel she absolutely must wear a slip is less cool than a somewhat thicker dress worn without a slip through which one can see a bit in a strong light . What if a man does see through your clothes a bit ? What with modern sportswear and beach clothes , almost every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a peeping Tom . Compared to the number of slips and petticoats worn fifty years ago , one might say only the relics remain . I think they will not last much longer . It is true that slips , and also underpants , keep many fabrics from mussing as badly when sat on as they would if worn right next to the skin . But there are now available a great many fabrics which do not muss , and when they crease , you can just shake them or pull them and the creases come right out . There could obviously be developed any number of fabrics which had this prop- erty . The department stores may send out a special mission to hang me , but I most earnestly advise that if you are buying anything , while the saleslady or salesman is not looking , you take up a bit of the material between your thumb and forefinger and twist it very tight . Then spread it apart and stretch it out and see if there are wrinkles . Even in the 1930 's when there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric salesmen by doing this to all the fabric samples that interested me . And I found plenty of goods which were crease resistant to the point that one could wear them a whole season without pressing . Pressing clothes absolutely kills them . If your clothes are somewhat mussed or creased , hang them on a proper hanger over the bathtub , turn on the hot water and let them steam a bit , pull them into shape , and then they will dry out smooth . The gentleman who presses his trousers by putting them under the mattress is far kinder to clothes than he who is always sending them to be pressed . Before concluding my general thoughts on all the underwear you have taken off , I must speak a bit about the only two articles most men ever wear : undershirts and underpants . The undershirt had almost vanished except when worn to absorb sweat under those too-thick men 's shirts and coats , but in the last few years it has reappeared to some extent in a rather fascinating way . More and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool shirts made of " women 's " material . The richer men wear them for leisure over their skin and with no coat . In town , these men always wear coats no matter how hot the weather is . Less rich men who go about anywhere coatless in hot weather , wear these shirts when they are " dressed up , " over undershirts . This , to a certain extent , defeats the purpose of these thin shirts , and why some men feel it necessary to wear the equivalent of the top of a slip under them is obscure to me . I have the feeling they , or their wives , find there is something vaguely indecent about seeing the hair on a man 's chest and his nipples through a shirt , at least in town . This is odd because it 's always been considered " manly " to have hair on your chest , and it is not yet commonly known the nipple can be a feeling part of the male sexual system . When this gets around it may be felt necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventuality I devoutly hope will not come to pass . Maybe I should n't have brought the matter up . Let 's forget it and abolish the last of the undershirts quickly . As to men 's underpants , when I asked one man why he wore them he said he did n't want to give them up because they were one of the few things left him to wear which could be gay . A man likes a few colorful gadgets in his wardrobe just as much as a woman does . And men 's woven cotton underpants are often quite gay and attractive , but they usually get so terribly mussed that by the end of any day they are a real mess . They  | should be made of fine material which ca n't wrinkle , and I believe a great deal of improvement could be made in the design . One of my husbands was always begging me to design some " crotch happy " underwear . There are those knitted briefs which a great many men wear . They are too medicinal-looking to be attractive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing uglier ? not even a woman 's panty girdle . I should think wearing knitted briefs all the time is rather the equivalent of wearing a brassiere . Both seem to prevent the parts covered from leading a normal life . The brief certainly looks like some object used by doctors to aide the mutilated or broken . " Garments which , through their lack of ornamentation , are clearly not intended to be seen ( such as women 's corsets and suspenders , the coarser forms of underwear , men 's braces . . . ) when accidentally viewed , produce an embarrassing sense of intrusion upon privacy that often verges on the indecent . It is like looking behind the scenes ' and thus exposing an illusion . True modesty and true aesthetics should alike seek either to eliminate such purely useful garments , or else to incorporate them into the total aesthetic scheme of the costume worn . " So says my favorite clothing author , Mr. Flugel . If your underclothing is not such that , aside from social prejudice , you 'd be delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should either throw it all away forever , or institute a reform . Let us be truly modest .  | RE-DRESSING DRESSING ! What crimes are committed in its name . We Americans are supposed to forever believe that we can cover all defects of our bodies and souls by dressing according to some pattern laid down by pontificators . We are supposed to subscribe to the notion that we can achieve a personal peace such as religion can not give by putting on ourselves a combination of objects which are socially acceptable to flocks of Americans , as wool is acceptable to flocks of sheep . Do you subscribe ? Here we are now , all naked : the bosses , the office workers , the clubmen and clubwomen , the Rotarians and Elks , the professors and the students , the fashion and women 's page dictators , the radio and television commentators , the soothsayers and propagandists . And you and me.  | We stand or sit or lie , hatless , shoeless , skirtless , underpantsless . We are stripped of jewels , lipstick , trousers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that either does or is supposed to make you and me and our fellow men and women a pleasure to behold . Yet , even in our nakedness , none of us looks or feels like all the rest . You are you and I am I. Each one of us now has just one thing in common : We 're bare of clothes and may redress the dressing wrongs we 've committed , or which , more likely , have been committed against us . Maybe you feel like joining a nudist camp or forgetting the whole thing by getting into a uniform for the rest of your life . Do n't do it until you 've read this section in which I 'll try to lure you into finding out who , what , why , where , and how you are . Of course , you may know all these things and be dressing accordingly . You may be divinely built , a living human Venus or Adonis . Perhaps you were brought up from birth to live , move , think and garb yourself freely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fewer still , if we examine the matter seriously , were brought up to be freethinkers , free doers , or free dressers . Only those who found that while laying themselves bare they stripped themselves only of what they had personally and individually chosen to put on can claim to have fully asserted their rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of dressing perfectly .  | To dress perfectly you must know yourself and be yourself . Here I 'll give you some means to that end . As there is nothing more enjoyable than thinking and talking about one 's self , we should all have a thoroughly satisfactory experience applying the suggestions I 'm about to offer .  | The Naked and The Live I 'M NOT in cahoots with any mirror manufacturer , but I ca n't imagine how anyone can get that consciousness of being perfectly dressed without the use of a full-length , triple looking-glass . This is not at all to imply any necessity for surveying yourself from tip to toe , back , side , and front , every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to know how many of you have a means of taking a good long look at your body . Your spirit and your brain have infinitely more to do with solving any dressing problems than your body . But the condition of your body , the way it moves and hangs , together or apart ; the texture of your flesh , the state of your muscles ; your general physical health ? these things  | are also important to being attractive . It 's imperative to be as critical of your body as if it belonged to someone else . The human body can be a very beautiful sight , to human beings anyway . I dare say we look pretty frightful to any other species ? hairless , featherless , and all that . The fact that it is our human nature to decorate our bodies is a sure sign we regard our naked selves as a bit colorless . The type of body we seem most to admire is one that stands effortlessly erect and can move smoothly , efficiently , gracefully : what one thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has that somewhat disgusting " indoor look , " as if it never breathed the air , felt the sun , or was used physically to anything remotely approximating its capacity . The body of a dancer looks as if it lived ? alive . To be specific about recommending articles of dress for an individual is dangerous and silly , since what 's satisfying to one is not to another . But there are a few specific physical means I 've run across that can be used to make or keep the body beautiful . The proportions of your skeleton may not be those considered most pleasing by current standards . You may be somewhat " fatter " or " thinner " than is said to be attractive at the moment , but none of that is very important if you have good control of your muscles . The very best form of exercise in the whole world for getting control of your muscles is ballet dancing , or  | ballet-type dancing , or ballet exercises . Even if you do n't know a thing in the world about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do is play some kind of music you like and then dance to it with a view to using every muscle in your body in every way it is supposed to be able to bend or stretch . Take your shoes off , of course , and anything else that impedes your movement in the slightest way . If you dance in a normally furnished living room there will be plenty of handy apparatus . Figure out how many kinds of bends you can do around and over and on all the chairs , for example . Practice swinging one leg up and over the backs of the chairs or corners of the tables . Bend , reach , get in a few somersaults , preferably in fairly slow rhythm . All this does n't have to be done alone . In ballet-type dancing the dancers are sometimes together , sometimes apart . The way people usually dance together today is scarcely dancing at all , just hanging onto someone and moving the feet about a bit in time to the music . All right . You can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to stand up straight and get rid of your potbelly . Half the potbellies ? male and female ? in the U.S.A. would vanish tomorrow if the wearers of these curious objects would just stand up straight . It 's a matter of sucking in your guts , quite simple when you have the habit of it , quite terrible to achieve if you have n't . You can not do it with a girdle on . By an effort of the abdominal muscles you simply pick  | up the potbelly , pull it back and drop it between your hip bones . To learn to do it , open your bedroom door , stand with your back against the thickness of the door , your heels just catching it on either side . Suck in your guts until your spine hits the door all the way down . Then hold your abdominal muscles in that position and walk away from the edge of the door a few steps . You 're now standing up as straight as possible . It has nothing whatever to do with your shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Relax your muscles and let your potbelly fall out . Pull it in again . When you 're driving a car , pull the muscles in until your spine is hitting the back of the seat all the way down . It 's the same exercise . If you stay at it , you 'll get so you unconsciously stand with your guts tucked in . If your stomach muscles are all flabby , lie with your buttocks just on the edge of a high bed , and putting your legs together , raise them straight up in the air , then down so your feet just do n't touch the floor , and repeat . It 's a marvelous exercise . You can only do it a short time . If your buttocks are flabby , do a lot of kicking exercises . Also roll over and over on the floor . l Female breasts which are n't broken down beyond repair can be built up by flexing the pectoral muscles by your armpits over the breasts . Massaging the breasts rather roughly can also help . Indian club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep their elasticity .  | Once I asked a woman about sixty-five how she 'd kept her fine upstanding figure . She said , " Every morning as long as I can remember , I 've gotten out of bed by putting my head on the floor and turning a somersault . " Taking exercise except for fun is such a bore it 's no wonder so many people let their bodies fall all to pieces when their work does n't make them move around . And we Americans are continuously riding in cars . But dancing is wonderful fun besides being good exercise . Now , if you 've finished looking at your body from the general point of view of whether it can move anything like as much as it was designed to , and whether a little special attention to a few glaring sags would n't be worth while , I 'd like to call attention to your bare feet . Are your toes all limber and can you see the full outline of all of them as you look at the top of your foot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the one next to it , having so much the habit of being squeezed by your shoes ? Are your feet all fine and smooth , or do I see a great big corn on that toe , a small red bump on several others ? What is the cause of your bumpy heel ? Are your arches in working order to the extent you can pick up a marble with your toes ? After the thousands of years it took for feet to develop , after man fought his way from barbarism through savagery , well into civilization comfortably shod , why does " modern " man insist on abusing his feet ? Most of you take a part of your anatomy without which you 'd be  | practically immobilized and deliberately , or unconsciously , frustrate its functioning , and beauty . Of course feet can be beautiful . It 's perfectly usual to hear hands called beautiful . The only reason it 's equally usual to think of feet as ugly is because of what our shoes do to them .

Did you do it this way and that and hard ? Hair likes exercise . Look at yours in the mirror . Male or female , if it 's summer and you have been a great deal in the sun , or if female , and you have had many permanents , your hair very likely looks all dried out , more like thin straw than that soft , silky or slightly wiry , rather electric-looking stuff people like to feel . Take a leaf from those who live in the tropics . Impregnate your scalp and hair thoroughly with some thin oil , and let it stay on for some hours , or all night if it does n't interfere with your pleasure , then wash your hair very thoroughly . The secret of washing you hair clean is to use enough soap . When you rinse your hair and it squeaks as you pull it through your fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It feels good .

Some people have such good muscle control they can wiggle their scalps without touching them . Now will you please scrub your face thoroughly with a softish brush and some nice pure unscented soap . Scent dries your skin , but there is nothing like soap for really cleaning your face . If you have dry skin , oil it up with something pure and thin .

If your complexion is bad it will help to use a mask occasionally as it stirs up the circulation and helps bring those bad things out . It is my opinion a bad complexion comes from a nervous condition . Adolescents are apt to be nervous , not sure how they should behave in a dozen situations both intimate and more broadly social . If they get nervous enough , they are very apt to break out in spots . When the  | nervousness disappears , so do the spots . I do not believe spots are caused by eating chocolate or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made you believe that is so . If she has and you eat chocolates anyway , you think you have committed a sin . And that makes you nervous . Spots are not caused by anything you do or what happens to you except what makes you nervous . Adolescents who have no nerverackingly important problems do n't have spots . Some doctors are going to say I 'm completely wrong , but I know just as many who agree with me . Young people are rather likely , in the United States , to feel they are misbehaving when indulging in practices common to the majority , like petting . It would be nice if someone took down data on bad complexions in relation to the feelings of adolescents as regards their sexual behavior . There is n't much spiritual gratification in " misbehaving , " even if all your friends are doing it , and it seems probable that many adolescents have bad complexions because they are highly nervous about their sex lives .

Perhaps I got this idea because a large number of people know fairly well whether or not they will feel good in clothes cut a certain way ? tight , loose , flowing , or static ? but comparatively few are absolutely certain about what colors really suit them theirselves . Ultimately I stumbled upon a color theory called Quantacolor , which formalized my feeling about the relationship of color to individual personality .

A great majority of the clothes bought and then left hanging in closets are found unsatisfactory because the color is wrong for the spirit of the purchaser . Let me strongly emphasize the fact that the right colors for you depend entirely on your personality , on your psychology . The shades of color which will make you most attractive bear no relationship to the color of your hair , dyed or natural , or of your eyes , or of your complexion , painted on or natural . It is what a certain shade of a color does to your spirit that matters . If a certain shade or tone of a color " gives you a lift , " then it is toned to your own Self , to your feelings about life and being . If the tone of a color is not just to your inner taste , eventually it will make your spirits droop . There is no such color as red or blue or yellow or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every color , and only such shades or tones as are in the same palette , as have the same cast , be they red , blue , yellow or any color , go together harmoniously . All good painters work in what is called a certain palette . At any given period in their work they paint all the pictures they are painting in the same palette . They may use every color imaginable , but always each color has the same cast to it and all the colors used in all the pictures of a given painter in a given period of his work will harmonize .   If you want to go to a little trouble to understand and use the Quantacolor Theory as I have used it for so many people , you may be sure that the tone of your clothes will harmonize with the tone of you , that you and your clothes harmonize at least as far as the color goes . I have written about Quantacolor before in a book and in an article for McCall 's Magazine and some people think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way I understand and use it does n't exactly coincide with the way the founder Mr. Elcock finds it works . However , I can assure you the method I evolved for using it , as far as one 's own clothes go , has failed no one in my experience . According to Quantacolor there are only four palettes in the world . In case there are any purists around , let us admit at once that this is in a sense an oversimplification , but as it is useful , do permit yourself to indulge . Every color , says Quantacolor , exists in each of the four palettes , but each palette contains a different shade or tone of the color . As I see colors , Quanta I is the way colors look in the rising sun ? alive , vibrant , what some people call pure color . Quanta II is the way colors look at noonday with the sun coming straight down on them . The color is flat . Quanta III is the way colors look just after the sun goes completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quanta IV is the way colors look when that brilliant yellow reflection which comes into the sky after the   sun has sunk falls upon them . The colors are all goldish . The colors in each palette are equally beautiful abstractly , but not to all people . Some people can not abide vibrant , Quanta I , colors . Usually children 's toys are painted in Quanta I. It is difficult for any but vibrant people to wear Quanta I because less vibrant personalities are wiped out or blurred by the strength of the color . Children can often feel perfectly fine in Quanta I colors , but not all children . And a certain number of adults I have dressed have wanted Quanta I , but I learned , after a while , that it was apt to sort of wear them down on days when their vibrancy was knocked out of them . Quanta I people are the innovators of this world , like Franklin Roosevelt , who was always ready to try something new . Women in Quanta I are apt to go about fast and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at home anywhere they can start something . Quanta II people are calm and helpful to others . They never rush about and they speak gently . They are the really loving mother or father type who do n't eat you up but help you along quietly and most kindly . In my experience , a woman who is mostly a II ( for no one is all one palette ) must always have the waistline of her dress exactly in her own waistline . She always wants some sort of small collar on all day clothes and she would never dress ostentatiously or excitingly , but always conservatively . Quanta II people are very much at home in quiet flower gardens .   Quanta III people are nostalgic and romantic . Their hearts bleed for the woes of the world and of their friends . They are often moody and shy . They belong in the spirit of the days of Mme. Recamier and love highwaisted dresses , lying on chaise longues , or walking in the dusk , dreaming . Quanta IV people like to put things together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to make a new world , but he loves manipulating to keep an old one going . The heads of a lot of women 's clubs must be IV 's . Women in this Quanta like rich materials , velvet , fur , gold . This is the Quanta of the Renaissance , the fulfillment of much that went before , and the glowing end of a day . To find out which are your preferred palettes , go to a museum or get hold of some good color reproductions and look at some pictures by the following painters : Quanta I ? Miro , Goya , van Gogh ; Quanta II ? Winslow Homer , Matisse , Renoir ; Quanta III ? ( early ) Picasso , David , Paul Klee ; Quanta IV ? Braque , Vermeer , Juan Gris . Of course , there are dozens of artists who have painted in all four palettes , but any of the above painters will serve to show you the tone of the different Quantas . You could take any color out of any painting in a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same Quanta and not cause a color clash . It is my belief that if we were all whole people , we would all like , and be , all four palettes equally . But at  | certain times we would prefer one or another . I have tested innumerable people by using twenty-four color reproductions , six pictures from each Quanta . In almost every case my subject reduced the set of pictures by preference to two in one palette and one in another . As there has been very little study of the psychology of people in relation to color , I am treading on somewhat dangerous ground . However , I have often enough tested my customers and friends to be able to say that if you can find a positive preference by looking at the work of the painters I 've mentioned , you are absolutely safe to buy clothes in that Quanta , and I think they will never become odious to you . I think that if once a palette has become part of you , or you have become part of it , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on buying clothes in Quanta I. A second palette may , over a somewhat lengthy period , become even more agreeable than the former favorite . It has happened to me . I was very positively a Quanta III for years , liking for myself the grayed nostalgic colors . Then , one year , something began coming over me . I got out the palettes and left them lying about for days . Finally I picked up the one I wanted most and it turned out to be the fourth palette . So in case you find your major preference is Quanta II and you seem to think you do n't really want more than anything to be the loving mother or loving father of all living , just let time pass . Pursue what interests you like  | most and one day you may awake to find you are quite as ready as Sir Winston to start putting all the pieces together , or in the dusk are dreaming of a lovely peaceful world , or , at dawn , are arising to help make it . Male or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all of your clothes in your primary palette unless it is Quanta I. In that case use your second choice chiefly . You will be happy in your primary or secondary palette colors and they will all harmonize , so that you can wear this shirt with that skirt or pants and the other jacket . One coat will mix agreeably with any dress in the same palette , no matter what the actual color , since the tone is the same . If you are at home in two or three palettes , you must have complete costumes in all of them , which is fine but expensive . For although I think no one has ever made a very thorough study of the extent to which people , onlookers or the wearer , are upset by a mixture of palettes in such a close relationship as a costume , it is certain that a good many are repelled whether they know why or not . I know that when I have to look at samples of material all morning , the palettes all mixed up sample by sample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm through . " Did n't Henry look terrible yesterday ? I wonder what 's wrong with him ? " It could be that Henry had on a tie in Quanta I , a shirt in Quanta II , a sports jacket in Quanta IV , and Quanta III trousers . Perhaps you , like an editor I know , think I am being   mystic . I have no objection to being mystic if it gains a good end . And I have proved to my entire satisfaction that as far as clothes go , the Quantacolor Theory works as I have used it , and you can easily use it . Then , of course , you can go further with it if you like . One night , in 1948 , I gave my test to twelve architects who had worked on the United Nations building . I did n't explain the thing until everyone had chosen his palette or palettes . I watched with great interest as one of the architects hesitated between a Quanta III picture and a Quanta IV . He kept saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I 'm afraid I simply must have the other , the III , if , as you insist , I am to live with it constantly . " When I 'd tested everyone and explained the various Quantas as I understand and use them , the man who had to choose the Quanta III picture , the dreamy one , instead of the IV picture , sighed and said , " Now I see why we are all so dissatisfied with the UN building . We have kept on and on trying to get what we want . But it 's impossible . The only thing we feel we can get right are the secretaries ' quarters . All the meeting halls we know will be changed again and again as the UN itself changes . We would like to design a completed building , a IV , but it 's impossible when the whole form of the UN is in an embryonic state . " Poor man . No wonder he was feeling rather nostalgic and having to dream . The architects were in no position  | to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations were n't really united . But you are now in a position to discover which palette or palettes are most satisfactory to you . And if you ca n't get that garment in the right Quanta , do n't buy it . To be sure , maybe you are that man or woman who can love and be all four Quantas equally well . If so , you could use your knowledge of the four palettes to make sure that at any given time , for any given occasion , you have put on a set of clothes in the appropriate palette . For example , how confusing it could be if you had decided to make a stirring speech to a large audience which was calculated to send them tearing out of the auditorium to accomplish some great purpose , and you absentmindedly dressed yourself in the grayed tones of Quanta III , in Picasso 's early palette . The audience would instinctively expect you to read them a poem by Lorca . They might not know it , but they would spend a lot of time musing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors you had on , the difference between the way they perceived you externally and what they would be half-hearing you say . If you were making a rather revolutionary speech , there could be something about your costume , maybe only a flower , that was pure exciting color . It is not by accident the American flag , a revolutionary flag , is Quanta I , " pure " red , white , and blue .   If you were exhorting your audience to hold the republic together in the face of some threat , to stand firm , you 'd do well to somehow achieve the Quanta IV effect of a stained-glass window with the setting sun Bolding its colors . This , of course , is part of the art of stage costuming . Let 's bring the use of the palettes a bit nearer home . Suppose you are a girl who has a beau you might even consider marrying . Suppose you love pure bright colors , Quanta I. Suppose your beau drops a remark now and then about how he ca n't stand red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is n't really the name of any color because there are dozens of shades of red in all four palettes . There would be some shades of " red " your beau would like . But when people say " red " they are normally thinking of Quanta I red and your beau has unquestionably tipped you off to the fact that " pure colors " get on his nerves . Could you tone down your color schemes a bit , or would that make you feel sort of dead ? I doubt it , because , as I say , everyone seems to have a major and a minor palette . To be a major I and a minor III is not at all rare . You go about starting things , but you also spend plenty of time dreaming over life . It 's terrible constantly to be wearing colors in a palette someone you see a lot of ca n't stand . Terrible for the someone . Life is full of compromises , and maybe here 's a time to make a slight   one . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing vibrantly dancing colors , then you 'd better get another beau . Until I discovered the Quantacolor Theory , which checked so well with my own unformalized discoveries and feelings on color , I used to have a terrible time putting any clothes into my collections in Quanta II , that calm-mother palette . It 's the palette I have the most difficulty liking or being . And yet , in the Thirties , the majority of my customers preferred Quanta II to all other palettes . After I stopped going by my instincts when I selected the colors for the models , I could deliberately assort the collection to make sure I would n't depress most of the customers by turning out everything in my own then favorite palette , Quanta III . If you are an art student of any kind , I believe you will find this Quantacolor Theory very useful . It differentiates shades of color in such a way as to bring out all a person 's color consciousness . Art student or not , there is so much pleasure to be gotten from really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worth a little effort to teach yourself for purely abstract aesthetic pleasure .   Did Your Parents Sin ? YOU ARE still , I trust , as naked as the day you were born , a day when you certainly were n't the least bit interested in dressing or in full-length triple lookingglasses . Indeed , if no clothing had been forced on you , it is debatable whether you would have had much to remove while reading this book . Among the many wrongs that need redressing , one much easier to set right than most is what 's done to children as far as dressing goes . The personal pleasures one can get from nakedness are innumerable ? child and adult . One can move with complete freedom , enjoying all the fine sensations of stretching and contracting muscles . The feeling of wind , air , and sun on one 's skin can be enjoyed to the full . One can admire , exhibit , and play with one 's body unhampered . All these pleasures are most happily indulged in   by babies and young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and healthy for the young by modern psychologists and an increasing number of parents and teachers . But despite the recognized pleasures and healthfulness of nakedness , even the small minority of children who are allowed to enjoy it off and on are often dressed at times when social custom demands adults be dressed and for no other reason at all . Even in the privacy of their homes , when protection against heat or cold or dangerous objects is nonexistent , most children from birth are never without some clothing unless they are being bathed . They are forced to accept what is put on them , even if it 's cumbersome and their heads and arms are twisted getting it on , and in danger of being torn off when the garments are removed . Instead of searching out or inventing some sort of garment which obviates these tortures , thoughtful mothers invent peek-a-boo or **33;1212;TOOLONG games to distract from the horror of it all . Above all , the male and female genitals are kept covered , which is a great annoyance leading to many wet pants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , this lays a sound base for the embarrassment or downright shame felt by plenty of people , even mates , at the sight of these unthinkable , untouchable objects . For the most part , one would think clothes , those movable houses in which one lives , played no part at all   in a person 's psychological development , so little real thought is given those worn by children . In many cases clothes must be the first disagreeable , entirely objective fact of life a modern person has to face . It 's a tribute to our civilized ability to conform without question that the majority of people wear what they do , unnecessary , ugly , uncomfortable as so much of it is . The basis for such thoughtless acceptance is laid in childhood . Let us consider children 's dressing from the point of view of the most basic reasons for , and reactions to , doing it . All anthropologists agree that the first desire of a baby is nakedness although occasionally being comfortably cuddled in something soft and warm is pleasurable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord , start adorning its body with gay , glittery objects like beads , ribbons , feathers . That 's about as far as a young child goes without being influenced by the external world . Let 's assume the child 's parents know all this and want it to get as much pleasure out of life as possible . They are faced with certain external facts . The temperature indoors as well as out may vary . The environment is not generally set up for children but rather for adults who do n't love themselves enough to make it always thoroughly pleasant for a naked person to brave that environment . Eventually , the child is going to have to wear some clothes in public . What are parents to do , and why ? In this day and age the parent ? or any adult who  | wants the child to learn to make up his own mind and function with as much pleasure and as well as possible ? can surely help develop these characteristics by the manner in which the problem of dressing is faced . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal , if so moved . Children can be encouraged to go naked outdoors a great deal more than they are . When social custom makes it imperative that children dress , they can very early adopt the attitude that even if it seems perfectly all right to their parents that they should not wear clothes , one has to take into consideration the feelings of other people , most of whom would be deeply shocked . It is quite the same sort of attitude taken by parents who do n't believe in any formalized religion , and bring their children up likewise . Such parents say : " We may not believe in it , but if they do let 's accommodate ourselves so as not to embarrass or outrage them . " Let the kids learn true clothes modesty from the start , the modesty that takes in important feelings of other people rather than that which seeks to conceal something which is somehow " indecent . " All thoughtful parents and child-helpers make sure children have access to the kind of decorative objects they like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on themselves and otherwise be " savage , " naked or dressed . The results , when worn to a party or school , are often rather horrifying even to the parents who promote them . But it 's only by personal experimentation   with dressing that anyone ever really gets the feeling for and about how to dress which results in dress , body and inner Self being one . Insofar as clothing is necessary , when it must be put on the child , it should be as light and unencumbering as possible , and that is a very great deal lighter and less encumbering than most people think . By giving a little thought to the matter , diapers can often be left off and such baby or toddler 's clothes as threaten to dismember the child as they are put on and off can be replaced , with a little effort , if you use your imagination and knitting needles or cloth , scissors and thread . Overalls , and later the blue jeans , have proved a great boon to children , in that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being scolded for being dirty or tearing his clothes . This seems a rather inhuman reason for needlessly encumbering legs , which are easier to clean than overalls and enjoy going free . This is merely one example to show how thoughtlessly children are dressed . You can think of plenty of others if you let your mind dwell on the matter and also refer back to your own childhood . What were you made to wear that you hated ? One of the worst things done to young children is overdressing them for cold weather . It may be that the young ones are susceptible to colds and must be carefully protected , but this should be a process of bundling up with a view to removing at least part of the covering as fast as possible . If the Tierra del Fuegans can go about   naked in the snow and be quite healthy , their children must very early get accustomed to the same practice . There has never been any sort of thorough study made of the actual value of warm clothes in retaining bodily energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised for the body which can automatically adjust itself to heat and cold . What sort of winter clothing were you made to wear when young ? Certainly the healthiest of adolescents today , when left to their own devices , wear very little outdoors in cold weather compared to what even their own parents wore . The boys generally have on the equivalent of a pair of brief cotton underpants , blue jeans , shoes , socks , a cotton shirt , a short woolen jacket , often unlined , sometimes gloves , and less often a cap , unless it 's snowing or raining . The girls have on approximately the same thing , or are going about bare-legged from the tops of their bobby socks to their knees with the wind whistling up their skirts . Left to their own choice , children would soon develop far more healthy ways of dressing than adults now follow . They would wear lighter , looser , less and more comfortable clothing . And , as children , they would certainly select more decorative , colorful clothes than those with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less like their mothers and fathers and not according to their own imagination . Horrors ! Who lately conceived the idea that   little girls from the age they could wander about in a bathing suit must cover their breasts ? Their male companions are certainly not lusting for them . It looks like another piece of that plot to turn all our women into as complete narcissists as possible . Some of these young ladies will spend a good ten years concerned with hiding their breasts before anyone , other than their mothers , has the faintest interest in these sex objects . From a purely utilitarian point of view , children 's clothes can be infinitely improved , and it is the children themselves who could offer the soundest advice on the subject . But , as I 've said , their advice would by no means end there . They would very much concern themselves with the decorative qualities of their clothes . Given the opportunity , a child will dress to be a large variety of people : cowboy , policeman , fairy princess , goblin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a manner of speaking , the child has no Self but tries out being anything that strikes its fancy . It 's a pity there is n't a wide variety of really beautifully designed costumes available for kids which they are encouraged to select and wear for " real " clothes . " Western " clothes are about the only sort of costume provided today . Sailor suits came to be considered " sissy , " but if they were made like real sailors ' clothes , I fancy they 'd have quite a success . There is some provision made for being a " man from Mars " now , but nobody takes all this seriously enough . When an imaginative artist draws an imaginary char- acter for a book or movie that appeals to children , a clothes designer and child psychologist , or someone who knows a lot about kids from all angles , could get in there and make a practical reality of the clothes . Also , the clothes of such imaginary characters could often be beautifully designed . Today , usually , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice if a few of our emerging science-fiction authors conceived of some planetary characters who wore enormously practical and beautiful clothes adaptable to children . It is very strange that in the minds of science-fiction writers there never seem to be any children existing on other planets . If I have managed to lead you to think seriously about children 's clothes and what you may be doing to your children , you have probably also given some thought to what was done to you in childhood by way of impeding your freedom of motion , your freedom of thought about sex , your pleasure in your own body , your imagination and the development of your artistic perceptions . To the extent we can see our real selves today as clearly and nakedly as one can see a newborn baby , we can recognize the dressing wrongs we 've committed , or that were and are committed aginst us , and set about redressing them . The next chapter should help you quite a bit to figure out how rightly or wrongly you are dressing your real self today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing as there are people . But unless you have some fairly clear idea of why you dress as you do , you can scarcely hope to achieve whatever you 're after . I am now going to list the major motives for dressing , discuss them briefly one by one , and then I 'll use myself as a guinea pig and show you what motivates my dressing . Of course , our motives and manner of dress change in relation to where we are and what time of what day it is . No matter how you dress , it 's for some combination of the following reasons : We are dressed for the purpose of : 1 . Purely decorative effect 2 . Displaying the body   3 . Displaying wealth , real or imaginary 4 . Sex appeal We are dressed to prevent : 1 . Excessive heat or cold as its affects the body 2 . Bodily contact with dangerous or disagreeable objects 3 . Social criticism 4 . Self-criticism We are dressed to please : 1 . Ourselves 2 . A mate or potential mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or women socially 5 . The boss et 's discuss the first set of reasons , for the purpose of which so much time and money is spent in the U. S. A. 1 . Purely decorative effect . To dress solely for this reason would be to turn yourself into an interesting and beautiful , an aesthetically pleasing , living moving human being , in the sense that a picture or piece of sculpture or building may be aesthetically but statically pleasing . This effect is often quite unconsciously achieved by peasants or people in native costume . When the costume is somehow a real part of the wearer , whether it has grown to be from appropriateness and long wear , or because it has been carefully chosen by a connoisseur , the same pleasure is derived from seeing a harmonious whole . The face may be wrinkled , the hands gnarled , the body bent , or  | the wearers of the clothes may be Greek gods : if their dress is an integral part of a worthy character , it is somehow beautiful to behold . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than consciously . Men and women in worn work clothes are more often really a pleasure to behold than either sex consciously trying to achieve some effect when they are n't even clear what they want that effect to be . However ? Those of you who are reading this book will surely not unconsciously be able to achieve , or have achieved , a completely decorative effect in your dressing . By very virtue of the fact you are interested in reading a book concerned with dress , you have clearly already eaten something of the fruit of the tree of dress knowledge and can never get that consciousness of being perfectly dressed without fully understanding the art . It is more than likely that most of you are n't consciously or unconsciously trying to be completely decorative objects , let alone what other things may be making you dress as you do . Did you ever look at yourself in a long mirror every time you dress and ask whether any great painter would be interested in doing a full-length portrait of you ? The painter , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you , dressed ? Is your personality hidden and distorted by your manly clothes , your make-up or hairdo , what you have led yourself to believe is fashionable , what someone has convinced you   is proper for the occasion ? Or are you a pleasure for the artistic student of humanity to behold ? The artistic student of humanity , being human , does n't expect complete perfection , is n't looking for prettiness , chic , fashion , but for a human being interestingly and harmoniously set off by whatever he 's chosen to do to that end . Anyone who consciously dresses only for decorative effect is either subhuman or superhuman because other motives are absolutely bound to be present . But unless the decorative motive is ever present , one can not possibly hope to come near being perfectly dressed . I can think of nothing that can better help you begin to have a deep sense of the true decorative potentialities of dress than spending a highly enjoyable time in art galleries , or with books , looking at the sculpture and painting which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the history of the times . Always you will find the painter or sculptor has given you a harmonious whole as between the person depicted , his body , his face , hands , and the way he , or she , is dressed . The total effect may be revolting , terrifying , wicked , sly , gay , exuberant , peaceful , but whatever it is , it will be harmonious . The color , character , composition will all be telling you the same thing , and when it is inspiriting it will be beautifully decorative , just as you will be if you are being your best self and dressing it . This seems to me to be the ideal for which all conscious dressing must strive if we are ever to gain that peace religion ca n't bestow .  | 2 . Displaying the body . You may be dressing for the purpose of displaying your body , for self-display . Male or female , a certain number of you have beautifully built bodies you yearn to show off simply to glory in the compliments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can arouse . All of us certainly have some of this in us although it may be completely buried , perhaps because the body did n't turn out beautiful , perhaps because men are n't supposed to have such feelings . A woman may have some part of her body ? her legs , her thighs , her arms , it can be any part ? which is in a more pleasing proportion than another part and she may , quite naturally and rightly , try to dress in such a way as to accentuate this . Men do it only to the extent they dare . If self-display is the only motive in your dressing you are , believe me , a narcissistic bore . 3 . Displaying wealth , real or imaginary . I believe the majority , not all , of the rich women in the United States who admit to being thirty years old , dress primarily to display their wealth and the kudos they derive from it in our society regardless of their brains , education , knowledge , common decency , or manners . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as a major part of one 's motivation in dressing is a display of wealth , the person is perhaps dressing her self , but it 's a pretty disgusting self and the fact always shows on her face . A jewel or a beautiful piece of fur can be very attractive on one person and perfectly disgusting on an- other . It just depends on why it 's being worn . If there is one reason for dressing , above all others , that ruins the appearance , it 's dressing to show off your real or imaginary wealth . Quit it , if you can get around to admitting you do it ! 4 . Sex appeal . Are you dressing for this interesting reason ? It is quite different from dressing simply to permit other people to admire the shape and movement of your body . A man with whom I discussed this book before writing it asked me what age group of women it would be for . It 's for women of all ages , I told him . " I am afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not sufficiently encouraged in this country to make that possible . " This comment was interesting in more ways than one . It showed the man felt the only reason American women give real thought to dressing is sex appeal . Around nineteen million women work , and this means the majority of the time they dress for work and not sex . Only a sixth of American women workers are secretaries and even all secretaries are n't forever out to get the boss into bed ? legally or otherwise . If American women dressed mainly for sex appeal and were seriously eager to greatly enjoy their sex lives , extramarital sex experiences once or twice a year for a couple of years would not be defined as marital infidelity . Most American women not only attempt but succeed   in blotting from their minds all thought of infidelity after marriage . But this is not what causes them to cease all thought of dressing for sex appeal at the average age of thirty . A sad fact of American life is that practically all women lose their sex interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much sooner , either because they 're broken down by housework and children , by money worries , by sheer boredom , or because they were never particularly interested in their husbands sexwise , in the first place , and merely married because , after all , a girl must . Most of my fellow women , after twenty-five or thirty , find some sort of boring way of dressing which is socially acceptable , or if they pay attention to their clothes , it 's positively not because they are trying to be attractive to . men . Some of them who seem to be trying to be attractive to men , who even think they are trying to be attractive to men , are dressing primarily for everything but sex appeal . Otherwise , they 'd be having much more sex than they have , inside or outside marriage . Although Dr. Kinsey did n't bother to mention it , the human male is not difficult either to seduce or keep . seduced if the human female really is interested and determined to seduce him and keep him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what American women are told in print and over the air about how to dress and behave , I am by way of being something of a specialist on the subject . I can say with   authority that the advice is positively not concerned with how a female may enhance her sex appeal . Unmarried girls are advised how to get men to marry them , not how to dress or act to assure themselves of a full sex life . Married women are advised how to hang onto their husbands , not how to try to assure themselves of abundant marital or extramarital passion . Although I could write a whole book on the subject , I will sum up my thoughts on the American female dressing for sex appeal by saying I do n't believe the vast majority have the foggiest idea of what it consists . A rule of thumb for achieving this end would be that only the opinion of the male ( or males ) by whom a female wishes to be seduced counts in deciding what her dressing sexfully would consist of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country have as their only firm opinion of desirable female dress the idea that women should be " neat , " dressing for sex appeal will in no way be a national necessity nor could anyone possibly consider it a national custom . As for males dressing for sex appeal , it is very little consciously done , but it appears to me many males have some primitive instinct for it which has not been blunted by " fashion expert " advice . Insofar as sex is felt to be concerned with a well-built and smooth-functioning body , containing considerable energy , it is remarkable how many men manage to convey that fact publicly . However , practically no impression of the shape and   motion of a male body can be conveyed if the man is dressed in a stiff sack suit . The male who is , however unconsciously , going in for sex appeal , will wear rather soft and loose clothes so that there is a distinct impression of the male body inside by the very fact that the clothes are sliding around over it . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made when they 're rigidly encased in well-creased tight-woven worsted . But soft flannel is different . And a loosely cut sport coat of softish , loosely woven material has the same ability of accommodating itself to the wearer 's motion and shape . In shorts or beach clothes a man can openly display his physical strength and manly build , if he has any , and this is supposed to be sex appealing . But is it ? No study has yet been made public of the correlation between the American idea of a well-built male body and the amount of sexual satisfaction it may give or receive . Therefore , the primitive ways in which many males endeavor to be sex appealing , being entirely based on physical matters reminiscent of the cave man , do n't necessarily prove anything at all . They simply are felt to prove something , which may be half the initial battle , but certainly does n't necessarily end , up with a female having any fun in bed . When the human male in the United States gets to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Self perfectly and where sex appeal is a motive , I expect he 'll discard the idea   that his sex appeal depends primarily on physical strength . He will find means of indicating that his artistic sensitivities and imagination are at least equally , if not better , developed than his physical attributes . By that time , no doubt , the human female will have learned that to the extent she is interested in dressing for sex appeal , a display of bare flesh is n't necessarily indicated . And , I should think , she too will have discovered that some public display of real personal artistry in dressing would indicate she might be more interestingly seductive than a cave woman in the privacy of the bedroom . Now we have covered briefly four things for the purpose of which you may be dressing or wish to dress : purely decorative effect , displaying the body , displaying real or imaginary wealth , and sex appeal . What may you be dressing , or wish to dress , to prevent ? 1 . Excessive heat or cold as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically before . People seem to be getting over feeling they must cover up very much to prevent cold , or sunburn , for that matter . And women have made big strides toward being comfortable in hot weather . Hurry up , men . 2 . Bodily contact with dangerous or disagreeable objects . Enough thought has n't been given yet to making houses and other buildings and their furnishings agreeable to skin and in such a way one ca n't mutilate one 's  | self if inattentive . And why ca n't all the surfaces one walks on be as agreeable to bare feet as the earth ? 3 . Social criticism . To prevent this is a very major motive for the way practically everyone in the United States dresses today . If you will calmly and quietly think exactly why you dress as you do under innumerable circumstances , maybe all the time , I believe you will discover it is because it 's the " proper " or the " right " way to dress . This is the foundation on which the fashion business for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . If you ask yourself a question about what to wear , it will usually be worded in such a way as to ask , " What will I be expected to wear ? " You will never be perfectly dressed to your own satisfaction if you depend on outside judgment as to , whether or not what you choose to wear is " right . " It is important that while a person is learning the art of dressing his or her Self other people 's opinions be sought and considered , both on what that Self really is and just what the effect of your current manner of dress makes on other people . But the objective is entirely to get you in a position so you can , as an adult American , make your own decisions . 4 . Self-criticism . You have to learn how to criticize your own dressing in advance of appearing anywhere prepared for display . There are some people who literally do n't care to what extent anyone adversely criticizes what they have on . However , such people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so imbued with a desire of dressing to please myself that when I feel like wearing blue jeans and going barefoot and am invited someplace where that " wo n't do , " I generally just stay home . However , when commerce rears its ugly head the situation can be different . Too much self-criticism can have dire results and it can , if it 's operating unconsciously , cause you no end of trouble . For example , it might be that you are dressing to go someplace where you hope to meet a potential mate . You may , if you 're the type who attempts in your primitive way to dress for sex appeal , put on a very low cut gown . Then you might survey yourself in the mirror and say , " Oh , no . This is too obvious . " Maybe nobody at the party would think so at all . But because your motive ? to hunt a mate ? is not felt by you to be good and pure , you 're self-conscious and perhaps too selfcritical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of underground fear they may be doing it to display their wealth , have an awful time deciding what amount to wear and when to wear it . If their motivations were quite clear to themselves , and they decided that showing off their wealth was perfectly fine , or they were just wearing the jewels because they thought it pretty , they 'd have no problem . Now let 's think about who you may be dressing to please .   1 . Yourself . Anyone who does n't dress to please himself or herself is losing the real pleasure to be derived from clothes . " Love thy neighbor as thyself . " If you are to get all the possible pleasure from dressing , you should dress as much for your neighbor as yourself , but surely no more . Here the vast majority of men , consciously or unconsciously , certainly do not permit themselves all the possible pleasures of clothes . They obey a standard set of rules which make their costuming hot , uncomfortable , and drab in appearance , most of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must make an extra effort to be recognized as gay , happy personalities , to offset the dullness of their clothes . And even the men who are grim or serious , like most of their clothes , were not born to be uncomfortably dressed . To the extent men insist their traditional clothes are comfortable , they are demonstrating they have renounced their Constitutional right to at least the pursuit , if not the attainment , of one kind of happiness . However , with the wide variety of dressing permitted to women today , any woman can dress to please herself , and others , to the extent she wishes . 2 . A mate or potential mate . We have seen while examining sex appeal as a motive for dressing that it little exists in the U. S. A. and is very primitively worked out . Maybe some of my readers will write me what they consider is really dressing for sex appeal . Then we can start a True Sex Appeal Magazine with a big section on Dress .   There are , sure enough , plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the way has nothing to do with mating . The more I write about all this , the more certain I feel that a splendid way to document the meaning of the U. S. A. and the American way of life from every point of view would be to do a socioeconomicpsychologic study of American dress . If you have a mate and he or she is influencing your dressing , what are the motives in this influencing and in being influenced ? Are you patiently paying your wife 's too large clothes bills because you are in hearty accord with her that she must dress as well as the boss 's wife ? If she is seeing to it you dress in a certain way all the time , is it so you 'll be more comfortable , more colorful , more agreeable , or because she thinks you do n't dress " right " ? " Right " for what ? " Right " for whom ? If your mate is influencing your clothes , or you those of your mate , why is it ? Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a good deal about the state of your marital and extramarital life . You may be dressing to please : 3 . A man or men socially , and 4 . A woman or women socially . These motivations have , in part , reference to the fact that in any social group there is apt to be a man and a woman who more or less set the dressing standards for the two sexes . If it is n't a single individual of either sex , it may be a kind of group feeling that solidifies what 's " right . " I do n't  | think I need spend any time enlarging on this type of motive for dressing . It is , of course , dressing to prevent social criticism in a way . People who go in for it fall instantly in line with the decisions of the arbiter of their set . If you have achieved a kind of artistic and psychological triumph by appearing for display with your body , dress and soul all one harmonious whole , you are gratified by the congratulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in any event , appreciate the results of those who rise to it . Even if you have arbitrarily figured out a soul , and then blended your body and dress to it , although it may be a sort of hoax , when well done it is very delightful . However , I 'm not trying to push any of you into becoming consummate actors of parts you dream up . And now for the dreariest motivation for dressing of all . You may be dressing during working hours , and even all the time , to please the boss . 5 . The boss . If you want to hold your job it is generally considered necessary to dress to please the boss . Those who will refuse a job because . it carries with it the necessity of violating their personal preferences in dress are rare but by no means unknown . That is , they are not unknown if one makes a habit of investigating the dressing realities of life in relation to individuals , as I am asking you to do in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to please the boss , to   suit the job rather than yourself , is that if you go on doing it long enough you turn into the job , and not , I might add , into the boss . I suggest you seriously consider your job or jobs , paid or otherwise , and question yourself on whether what you do in that job really suits your self . The answer will , I fear , usually be no . It is really remarkable how many people in the United States spend their lives working at something they do n't enjoy at all . It 's my sincere feeling that insofar as this is usually an economic necessity , or the inevitable result of marriage , and absolutely unavoidable , the least you can do to make your working life more pleasurable is dress as you really please . Should the boss object , you can assure him or her that your efficiency is definitely heightened by being able to dress as you please . I will now list again what I hold to be the major motivations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , someone suggested to me that most women who spent a great deal of time on dressing did it purely because they had nothing else to occupy them . Should you be in that category , perhaps you can get more fun out of your major occupation by deciding arbitrarily to start adorning yourself for whatever seems to you the most engaging of the reasons I offer . You and I dress as we do for some combination of the following reasons , and the combination may vary , depending on circumstance . But we make a very bad job of the dressing if we are n't conscious of the motivation .   We are dressed for the purpose of : 1 . Decorative effect 2 . Displaying the body 3 . Displaying wealth , real or imaginary 4 . Sex appeal We are dressed to prevent : 1 . Excessive cold or heat as it affects the body 2 . Contact with dangerous or disagreeable objects 3 . Social criticism 4 . Self-criticism We are dressed to please : 1 . Ourselves 2 . A mate or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A woman or women socially 5 . The boss Let 's see now what motivated my present costume . It is a cold , damp , rainy day in summer near the New Jersey shore . I am typing in a room with a large window open to keep the place from becoming a smoky horror . I shall almost surely be seen by no one . I have on what is to me a very beautifully faded and worn blue denim jacket , open-over a black and white striped " man 's " shirt , a pair of shocking-pink rough cotton Mexican pants , and very stretched , clodhopperish , rather stiffsoled moccasin-type shoes . What am I dressed for ? 1 . I blush to admit I am clearly not dressed for the
