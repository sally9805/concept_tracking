 | OLD CENTURY 'S RIVER ALMOST as soon as he found those two miraculous bottles of whiskey he knew that they meant the end , and were to be the means of it . He did not state this explicitly to himself , but felt it below the level of worded thoughts or of admission , as a wild animal knows that its end is coming , as an old jungle hand , by the time he had reached his age , should have learned to know . He saw the little suitcase that contained them by pure accident , because one of his awkward , improvised crutches slipped as he was turning away , after he had cut his ' fourth heart of palm . Four hearts of palm were n't much of a supply , but that was all he had strength for now . It was better to go short , and be sure of making it back to his shelter and his mosquito net before dark . He turned slowly , one crutch slipped , he caught himself , and it was then hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-growing racoon palm . His faded blue eyes studied it for several seconds while he remembered that Tolling had looked for it , and had said that , among other things , he had two bottles of good whiskey in it . He lowered himself to the ground slowly , with elaborate care not to jar his bad leg . The slightest jolt , twist , or even just wrong position meant a white swirl of pain which was not quick in going away . Presently he was on the ground , his legs out in front of him , and had pulled t he little suitcase into the open . He felt the case gently with the palm of his hand , studying it . It was about eighteen inches long and a foot wide . It had been badly scratched , probably bounced off a couple of trees when it was thrown from the plane , and one end was slightly charred . Three weeks lying on the damp ground had done it no good . St ill , you could recognize its quality , the quality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanning . The brass locks were neat and solid . The initials under the handle were clear , " J.H.T. " Tolling 's case all right , and because he had not yet given up his fight , he could think that it was too bad that by now Tolling and McDaniels , two young and healthy men , might well be dead , and to consider with a hit of triumph and a bit of laughter that he , old , injured , his system charged with God only knew how many tropical infections , was still alive and still fighting . An Indian would have given up by now . An Indian 's reason would have told hint that it was all over days ago , and very reasonably he would have given tip and avoided a lot of discomfort by deliberately ( lying , the way Indians know how to do . A white man goes beyond reason , not with hope so much as with determination , and so a lot of times he wins out when he ought not to . Thus the first thing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at that moment applying to his situation the meaning of the thing he had just admitted to himself , his belief that Tolling and McDaniels had failed to @#  | make it . He thought of their probable demise only as a contrast to his own survival , with the triumph that the aged , the sick , the disreputable feel over the downfall of the young , the strong , the correct . He remembered the ridiculousness of being hired by those two young fellows to guide them in the air . He remembered their tale of gold cached in an ancient mound , and the map and the old letter they had to prove it . He knew better , but they offered him nice work , good pay , and a cut in everything they found , to fly around and identify places from the air , later to run their camp and supply train . In honesty he 'd warned them that they were starting too late , with the rains coming on ; but they wanted to make a scout now , and come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyway , he 'd long wanted to know what it was like to fly . He sure as hell found out . Sick and frightened , right from the start . And then good and lost ? everything looked so different from the air . All he could do was feel awful and hang onto himself , and hang onto the gleam of the river , when he could and it . After the crash , Tolling had delayed awhile , looking for the valise , before he and McDaniels started out . He had hoped to find it , not only for the liquor , but because it contained personal papers and a large-scale map of Chiapas . Tolling set a lot of store by maps . The trouble was , he had looked too close to the wreckage of the plane . From where he sat , the old man could not see the clearing in which they had come down , but he could see , like shafts between the great trees , the glow of light which marked it . The clearing was of no interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Except where the plane had cut a swathe and made a scorched area , it was all oleander , high as a man . They were dead and he was on his own , all right . IIe was sorry about them . It had been fine , the way they dragged him away from the burning wreckage , the way they splinted him and fixed up his shelter under his directions , and the generosity with which they divided the salvaged supplies with him . They had wanted to try carrying him out , but he knew that that would never have worked . Even then , when they stood before him , ready to go , he 'd figured that forty miles of this kind of bush , with the swamp to cross , was going to be tough going for a couple of complete greenhorns . The bearing of their failure upon his own situation began to impress him . To free his mind of it , he concentrated on the suitcase . He was a trifle lightheaded , not with the familiar fever of malaria , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poisons being manufactured in his leg . He tried the catches . The two locks snapped open . Good . He lifted the lid . The top layer of socks and some brightly striped drawers kept the rest of the contents snug . Under them were various papers in several bundles , the folded map , and the two bottles . He did not touch them , but sat studying the labels and seals . The best , bottled in bond , aged , one hundred proof , the kind of liquor the very existence of which a man completely forgot in the little towns of the back country , drinking barbed wire , aguardiente , most of the time , and Habanero when he was flush . The pale golden-brown contents of the two bottles promised him pleasure and relief from pain . The continuous throbbing of his leg this last week had at first broken his sleep , and the last few nights had allowed him to doze only in snatches . With one of these under his belt .. . Seldom in his life had he tasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold and sold out , and went clear to Mexico City . It had been his plan then to go to the States , with all the cash he had , but Mexico City had everything , even blondes . He suspected that that blonde of his was synthetic , but if so she had done a job of it . She was blonde all over . He frowned over her name . Rita ? Rita something , claimed to be half Polish . She was expensive as hell , but worth every peso of it . The memory of those six weeks had stayed good for years . She 'd gone in for all sorts of mixed drinks , but he had mistrusted them ; that was when he got onto the fine Bourbon . It goes down like tea , and it 's as strong as anything that ever hit your stomach . He closed the valise . Drawing his machete , he cut a length of narrow , flexible liana . The act took two flips of the wrist . He handled his machete with old skill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade down as though it were heavily weighted . There was no more strength in him . With the liana he slung the valise from his shoulder . Then he sheathed the machete and went through the long , careful , effortful process of getting to his feet and onto the crutches Tolling and McDaniels had made for him . 2 IT WAS about a hundred feet from where he stood to his shelter . He had come so far only because he had cleaned out everything edible nearer , at least everything that grew in places open enough for him to penetrate . Cutting a path into the really thick places was quite beyond him in his condition . As he inched his way back , he made a remarkable picture . He wore a fairly new , straw sombrero , set aslant on his longish , white hair . His three weeks ' beard was scraggly , curly , and nearly as white as the finer hair of his head . His face was deeply tanned , of a sickly color under the tan , lined and sunken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? with the advance money the young men had given him , but these now looked as if he had had them for years . They were filthy . The shirt  | had several rips in it . The left trouser leg , over his bad leg , had been cut away at the knee . On his left foot , the newly purchased , high laced boot had likewise been cut away above the ankle , leaving a sort of shoe . In between was the splint , fashioned out of pieces of the wrecked plane and wrapped with materials which had become gray-black , fuzzy , rotting rags . In his left breast pocket , four slender , white hearts of palm stuck up like candy sticks . His machete and knife hung at his waist , the little valise , woefully heavy , slid around against his hack and his side . He concentrated on his panting progress , leaving for later the endless , rambling self-communions of a man who has been long alone . The forest in front of him lightened , there were the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neighborhood of the clearing . He came out on the edge of the river beside his shelter . He rested , looking at the river . It was familiar ; a great part of his life had been spent along it . Its presence supported him . Within easy distance of him were a number of traps , the simple arrangements of sticks the Indians make for catching the smallest animals . He scanned them carefully , without expectation ; he 'd been living and moving around here too long for the little creatures to be coming by . His shelter was a simple affair of palm branches and a tarpaulin , a lean-to facing the river . One end was over the roots of a massive mahogany , the other was partly closed by a smaller tree . In a rise of ground between two roots was his bed , a pile of palm branches and a blanket with the mosquito net suspended above . Behind that , on the raised shelf of another root , were his rifle and his supplies . In front of the shelter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fire . The edge of the circle was cut by a frying pan with a spoon in it and a blackened tin can , its top bent , backwards to form a sort of handle . His supplies were cached in the empty tin cans beside the rifle . In one was a small bag of salt and another bag containing a handful of rice . A second was half full of carefully saved cigarette stubs , and on top of them an empty quinine bottle containing two whole cigarettes . In others were some money , some pieces of newspaper , a dozen matches wrapped elaborately in part of an oilskin tobacco pouch , and a bottle of insect repellent , nearly empty . Between the bed and the fireplace stood a badly dented , Army issue canteen , its upper part fire-blackened , lacking its canvas cover and its cup . Most of the cans showed the effects of fire . The rifle had a charred place on the stock . Along the barrel were a number of spots of rubbed-down rust . After a moment 's hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid it carefully on a root . He hefted the canteen , and was relieved to find it full . It had become difficult to remember whether he had stuck to his routine of working his way to the water and filling it before he went looking for food . He tended to his fire , uncovering the coals , laying on twigs and bark , fanning gently with his hat , until he had a dependable little flame . Daylight would last at least an hour more , but already the river was beginning to fill with shadow , while the sunlight became sharper , more emphatic , on the far bank . The occasional bole of a great tree , exposed directly to the light , turned gold . The water was a living , dull metal , moving in an oily , quiet , powerful , yet sluggish way , with blue here and there in its swirls . The Chacalja ? the river had a dozen names , Spanish , Nahua , Mayan ; from among them this one , the one the Indians of the headwaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant the whole . The name Concha used for it . The hut he had lived in with Concha had n't been far from here , when he 'd been a young sprout . A doll , a kind of toy , a live toy who could love you and keep house and laugh and make you laugh . He wanted not to think of her , but could not stop the sequence , first of Concha in those good months and then of how she screamed and wept when El Nopo , that bandit bastard , and the troops of his private revolution came through and took her along with them . You were a young Gringo and you worked for the oil company . You were a Gringo and strong and wonderful , and you were supposed to be able to cope with anything , and you stood there looking into the rifle barrels while they tied your girl on a saddle . That was what started off the first big drunk . He quit his job clearing trail and got really in Dutch with the company . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He certainly had stayed drunk a long time . 3 HE OPENED the valise and got out the bottles . They were fair prey ; and maybe , if he got out of here , he could use the clothing , but the papers belonged to Tolling . Some of them were handwritten letters . They ought to be sent home . Holding one of the bottles , thinking of that , he really thought out and faced the first fact . In the end of the dry season as it was now , with the bush at its driest and openest , you could figure on a couple of healthy men taking ten days to go forty miles , if they did n't hit a made trail further down the river and if they were green at bush travel . You could figure even on two weeks . But you could not figure on three . He knew where he was , as he had told them , about five miles below El Salto , the first fall , and forty miles above Ocantan . At Ocantan there were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two double canoes with outboard motors . They would have been here by now ; the river was low and mild . Being completely green , the young men had not gotten out . There was only 22 THE ATLANT  | one answer to that one , they were dead by now . Easy enough to happen , too . So here he was . He opened the bottle slowly and smelled of it . Then he lit the cigarette . Boy , this was life . A remark he had heard somewhere came to mind : " James , serve the champagne in tin cups , the gentlemen wish to rough it . " He took a pull at the bottle . It was really prime stuff . He had smoked little the last few days , because the smoke tasted foul , but now his cigarette was good . He meditated taking a swig of water , but decided in favor of letting the liquor glow in his mouth and throat and stomach . He set the bottle down with care and smoked , looking out . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Concha , when he was a young sprout full of beans and had a regular job . If you could go there now , you probably could not find the spot , any more than you would be able to find any trace of this camp a few years from now . now long ago was that ? Ile had to do a little counting to figure that this was nineteen fifty , not forty-nine . Usually a little thing like that made no difference . He came out in nineteen hundred , the leap year when it did n't leap , the turn of the century . He liked to say that , after the lapse of time had made it impressive , " I came out here at . the turn of the century , when I was a young sprout , " so that back when he was hardly fifty the Americans had taken to calling him Old Century . Those two boys , Tolling and McDaniels , had called him " Mr. Century " when they first met him . The cigarette was half gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly half a century , and not much to show for it . No sign of that fortune he 'd been going to make . Ile 'd had one real friend , Whittaker , and old Whit was long gone . Up this same river , too . He wished old Whit were here now to sit with him and pull at the bottle and watch the day go over the Chacalj ; c and night come down . It would be a pretty night , with a moon , if it did n't cloud up . There 'd been a lot of clouds around lately . Be a hell of a note if the rains started tonight and ruined this hinge . Old Whit had said one time , when they were both good and drunk , that it was a pity he , Century , had n't stayed school and gotten an education . He 'd have been a poet or a philosopher , Whit had said . Funny thing , he 'd felt something that way about Whit . Apart from Whit , he could n't say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of men of different kinds , yes , liked some of them , been able to work and live with a lot of them , but not friends , not really . First he guessed he was too brash , and then maybe too much of a rum-bum . Besides , the more you live in the bush and along the river , the more you want . to be let live inside yourself . There had been a variety of women , some of w horn he remembered sharply , some of whom were mere whorehouse blurs , vague punctuations to @# drinking , but none of them had lasted . He 'd have liked to have had Eufemia last , but Eufemia was a Tehuana , and she ended up by going home with a Tehuano man , the way they always do . He guessed his kid was a good Tehuano , speaking Zapotec as his mother tongue . The chief thing he could say for all these years was that he 'd never worked hard , not steadily that is , and he 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that here he was , sick , old , and crippled , and still alive after three weeks . Most white men would be dead by now . The grub left him would n't have lasted ten days . If his leg cleared up he could tough it out indefinitely , even after the rains came if he had to . And the two young men were dead . Apart from his leg there was nothing the matter with him . Of course , he guessed he 'd been orating to himself a lot , but anyone does that who lives much alone in the bush . He had a drink to his own mastery of the wild country . As that drink took hold his mood changed . He thought of the great joke of being hired by those two young fellows and how , to clinch the job , he had artfully let them draw out of him every fool story he had ever heard of gold being found . Anyone knew it was all bunk . He 'd seen it proven a dozen times . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 4 Acurassow , big and black looking , lit on a branch not twenty feet from him . Be stiffened and reached for his rifle , almost lasting the meat . The bird flew off again . lie swore . Ile had moved too soon , before it got settled . IIe looked at the little package of rice and his slivers of heart of palm , studying The rice for a long time . He looked at the bottles , then out over the river . The higher bank opposite was completely in shadow , and the shadow was mounting rapidly up the trees . With a manner of finality he built up the fire , poured water in the tin can , and set it to boil . IIe watched it in a sort of blankness until the water bubbled properly , then with the same manner of finality he poured in the last of his rice and added salt . I Ic cut the hearts of palm carefully into small pieces and added them . The extravagance which wiped out his entire larder was committed under compulsion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank again , this time following the drink with a brief chaser of tepid water . He did not want to empty the canteen and be forced to the difficult process of going down the bank to the water . Do that in the morning , on a morning drink . If only his leg started mending he 'd be all right . If he could get around even as well as he had at first , he would n't worry for grub or for being able to tough it out . He 'd last until he could walk like a man and then , rains or no rains , he 'd get out to Ocantan . They would have made sure he was dead .  | He chuckled . It had happened before . Old Century dead and buried a lot of times , and he turns up again . Just a bad old man , but powerful hard to kill . In one of the tin cans , underneath bits of newspaper , he still had a hundred pesos , part of the advance the boys had given him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocantan , the known limits of hospitality and the extension of those limits to be made by the judicious buying of drinks all round , and he planned himself a pleasant stretch of time once he got out . The Swiss , Anduller , set a good table . The rice was clone . The stew lacked meat , but latterly he had been eating little , both to stretch his small reserve and because he lacked appetite . Now his stomach had come magnificently to life under the influence of the whiskey . The stew was delicious . Cooked , it just about filled the can . He cleaned it all out , at first greedily , then with more leisure and appreciation of enjoyment . When there was nothing left : but a few inaccessible grains , with a sense of lavishness and pleasure he threw the can high . It sailed through the air , turning over on itself , and dropped beyond the bank . He listened for a splash , and was disappointed when he could not hear one . The dinner called for another good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched and sighed luxuriously . Briefly the strong light remained on the treetops across the river , while the wall of the main mass was mysteriously blue ; then the light went , and almost without transition the far wall became a black strip rising to the sky while the river itself , which had been dark , acquired reflections of light . Beyond those trees , to his left , he could see indications of the moonrise . Tomorrow would be the full moon . He greeted the night with another drink . The bottle in his hand brought his mind back to the boys and the plane ride with them . He had been pretty well lost until , just before the engine stopped working , he had recognized El Salto and the S-bend of the river by the big swamp . The swamp it was most likely that had got the boys . Then everything had come unstuck at once , and he had n't done anything but pray until they pulled him out from under the wing and brought him round . It had been a satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just where they were . Ile remembered now their look of respect , just as he remembered trying to tell them how to get by in the hush , and feeling even then that you could n't tell it to someone , it had to be learned . You had to live it . He could not exactly say that his leg had stopped hurting , but he did n't mind it much . He wished he had some coffee to go with his dinner and lead back into the drinks in a proper manner . He wished Whittaker were here . There was mist in the enclosure of air over the river now , and the moon , coming up beyond the ocean of trees , began to reach the upper wisps of it and make them glow . As a result of light at the higher level , the river itself was lost in darkness . It would be nice , to have Concha here now , Concha or ? he remembered a phrase ? or the equivalent thereof . It was MacNamara at Frontera who used to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine it , but Whit would be better . It would be the end of both bottles , sure enough , if he could turn up again . Old ( Century , fifty years in the bush , and what had he to show for it ? Lying here like a goddamned sultan , looking at the moonrise over the Chacalja , with a full belly and a rotting leg , and more of the finest whiskey in the world than he could possibly get : down in one night . That was a hell of a note . IIe held the bottle up to the moonlight to see how far he had lowered it , and as it was not even halfway yet , he drank again . " Or the equivalent thereof . " This stuff had no equivalent . MacNamara , he 'd gone back to the States . A lot of them had gone back , some of them had stayed here , dead . Why did they all go back to the States ? IIe could have gone back , two or three times , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time , like that best of them all , his visit to Mexico City , he got to somewhere where the facilities were good and there he stayed until he was broke . It never made him feel bad , winding up broke . Who the hell wants to go back to the States ? Drinking the best whiskey in the world on the moonlit banks of the Chacalja , when by good rights he ought to be dead a week ago . It seemed to him that there was some connection between the lowering of the level in the bottle and the lowering line of the shadow around him . Ile was not able to keep pace , however , and he did not really try , because to have emptied the bottle by the time the moonlight reached him would have been to force his pace unpleasantly and bring pleasure to an end too soon . It was just one of those fool ideas that used to amuse Whit " Do n't kill the bottle , just squeeze it slowly to death . " That had been Whit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full . Ile took its light on his face . The light was a ragged silver line along the edge of the cut-bank in front of him , and shortly , or he thought it was shortly , it reached the river . The fact that each change he was watching was totally familiar did not in the least decrease his delight in it . As drunk as he was beginning to be , his appreciation was intensified and he felt , as he had when he was young , and on other drunken occasions , that there was much more in this than the eye beheld . Although familiar it was unique , it was a manifestation of something great which hovered just beyond the line of comprehension . The thin mists lay between him and the moon , 11  | forming streaks of luminosity . The jungle on the other side was a jagged silhouette of deepest blueblack with silver edges and curious sprays and spurts of silver , or of white , ice-cold fire along the top . The river swirled black designs in the brightness of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the edges , merging into an area of blackness on each side . The ice-cold fire lay on his hand ; it lay , barred and mottled with shadow , around him and between him and the edge of the bank . The thing was enough in itself ? he needed no one , lacked for no company . He drank slowly but at some length . The liquor now really did go down like tea . This is what Old Century 's got , he told himself . He 's got the Chacalja River . He 's got this . I got this and I got the bush , and the satisfaction of knowing that even this old and bad off I can stay alive here and have the love of it . This is what I 've got and it ai n't hay . He put his bottle to his lips , tilting his head well back , and felt insulted and fooled when it ran dry at the second swallow . He looked at the empty bottle and then at the untouched one . He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone down . IIe hefted the empty bottle , set it down , picked up the full one , and as he ( lid so , feeling the second bottle 's weight , the inner realizations which had been working to the surface ever since he saw these two miraculous containers , which he had been holding back and denying since they began gathering days before , came to the top . There was the simple , central fact of his leg . It did n't only hurt him like fury , it was not only swelling , it smelled . Unable to wash or change his clothes , he had gathered about him a general , ripe , definite smell , but after enough time has gone by , a man ceases to notice his own odor . This was different . He knew perfectly well what it was and what it meant . With food and shelter , still he and his leg had only a few more days to go , days of increasing pain and wretchedness . And he was at the end of gathering food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of that God-sent bottle , but he could not survive on that . He was through . It was , of course , quite unnecessary for him to restate all the factors of his situation to himself . IIe knew the bush , the river , himself , and how men die much too well . IIe simply admitted their sum and told himself , This is what I 've had . So now what ? The surface of the river was now entirely covered with a low-lying mist which lay in slight , irregular waves , shining white , with decorations of soft , bluish shadow . From the main body , higher elements detached themselves here and there . This soft brightness gave a new background for the silhouettes of the growths immediately in front of him , a new value to the dark , silver-topped block of the far side . This phenomenon , too , he knew the upper wisps of it and make them glow . As a result of light at the higher level , the river itself was lost in darkness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concha or ? he remembered a phrase ? or the equivalent thereof . It was MacNamara at Frontera who used to say that . Concha or the equivalent thereof .

The light was a ragged silver line along the edge of the cut-bank in front of him , and shortly , or he thought it was shortly , it reached the river . The fact that each change he was watching was totally familiar did not in the least decrease his delight in it .

The thin mists lay between him and the moon , OLD CENTURY 'S RIVER 25  | was no trick to sit on it and balance with the water up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The old Chacalja , he thought , this is what I 've got , this is what I 've had . The high boot laced on his healthy leg kept the good water from washing about it as it did the other . He wished he 'd taken it off , but it was too late for that now . Balancing on the log , he dug out the bottle , hoping the water had n't got into the liquor . That was one place the river did not belong . He took a solid drink , his face raised towards the soft whiteness which covered him . Faintly here and there he could make out the outline of the black shadow of a tree . It seemed to him that he was experiencing the essence of the river . He was sitting in the middle of a misty sphere , which in the direction of the moon contained a great , luminous circle with that brightness in the center . I sure as hell wish Whit was here , I wish he could see this . The good old Chacalja @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , waiting . The river and all that that term embraced in its true sense . The slow waters were waiting for him , the lagartos , the alligators , were waiting for him . Along the banks the countless roots which drew their life from the river waited for him , and so did the big and little fishes , the water grasses , the buzzards , the insects , and all the various and beautiful snakes , the nauiacas , the masacuates , the culebras , and the rest . The only people who did not form part of the river , and who therefore did not have sense enough to be waiting for him to join them , were the men who lived along it . They would be curious , perhaps even worried , about his disappearance ; the others would know . The graceful animals who drank at the river and who fished in it , the deer , the lions , the iguanas , the jaguars , the big , slow-moving dantas , would know , the mists , and the days and nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sands and rocks . He was conscious of them all , and he embraced them . The sphere with its area of brightness , in which he could see nothing and beyond which he could see everything , contracted and expanded . The moon-spot tended to whirl , or else he was whirling . It seemed to him that he had experienced this manifestation before . He took another good , long pull at the bottle , a longer pull than he really wanted , forcing himself , because he did not think that he would get to take many more . Holding the bottle by the neck with its bottom resting on his thigh , he stared at the moon-spot . It was all waiting for him . He knew it all ; if Whit were here right now he thought he could explain to him what that thing was you felt in the beautiful moments , that thing that had always been just out of reach when you watched the moonrise or the dawn , and at such times .
