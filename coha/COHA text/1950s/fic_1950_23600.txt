It is not that competitors are now being ruthlessly squeezed out , consumers gouged , and the door of opportunity closed . It is that this may happen in the future . The gist of the Court 's action is prophylactic and preventive ; and it is this . in fact , which brings it so much sympathy in Congress and with the public . Thus the essence of the Supreme Court 's new view of the law is in the fact that it is concerned with potential future abuses rather than past ones . " Actual exclusion " of competitors is not necessary to a Sherman Act violation ; and the Court takes into account " prospective " and " putative " competitors as well as present ones . The same fear of the future was expressed by Representative Emanuel Celler , head of the House judiciary sub-committee " on the study of monopoly power , " when he said , referring to a recent Federal Trade Commission report : " Suppose that instead of 46 per cent of the total net capital assets being concentrated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 100 or 125 manufacturers ; and I fear that is going to be the result in the next 25 years . " ( Author 's italics . ) Perhaps the peak in such apprehensions was reached in the Circuit Court 's decision in the recent case of the New York Great Atlantic k Pacific Tea Company . Said the Court : " The inevitable consequence of A P 's whole business pattern is to create a chain reaction of ever-increasing selling volume and ... purchasing power for A &; F , and for its competitors , . . . conceivably , ultimate extinction . " T HERE are reasons for doubting such a trend , or that , to paraphrase an old saying , " the big are getting bigger and the small are getting smaller . " It does n't seem to be working that way . The big ones , true , are getting bigger  --  but only proportionately ; the little ones also are getting bigger , as well as more numerous . There seems to be some kind of balance at work , as in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , for instance , figures published in the past two years by the Commerce Department and Federal Reserve Board would seem to indicate that ( 1 ) the number of separate business enterprises , in relation to the non  --  arm population , is about the same as fiftyyears ago ; and ( 2 ) in recent years the small and middle-sized firms have actually grown faster than the big ones . And the alleged trend is sometimes quite a legal fiction . Thus in the A P case the government brief charged that " the picture . . . is one of an ever-broadening . . . spiral of monopoly and trade restraint in the hands of A &; P. " But during the period under review A &; P 's share of the nation 's grocery business fell . And in recent years independents in this field have been gaining at the expense of chains , voluntary at the expense of incorporated chains , local at the expense of national chains , and other national incorporated chains at the expense of A &; P. And in the above-mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little fellows tripled their share of the cigarette business . A recent study by the Federal Trade Commission of The Concentration of Productive Facilities , 1947 , of twenty-six selected industries , shows a widespread big-three and big-four dominance . But this study is not comparative with previous years . It relates , for instance , that in 1947 the United States Steel Corporation had some 35 per cent of the ingot capacity of the industry , but does not mention that thirty years earlier , Big Steel had 60 per cent . In general the percentages of concentration shown for 1947 for the various industries were actually unchanged or shrunken from a generation earlier . There are reasons for this " dynamic stability " in the relations between big and little business . For one , bigness seems to fit with some industries , like petroleum , tobacco , and rubber processing , and not others , like textiles , printing and publishing , and apparel . For another , big firms ca n't move fast enough to compete with little ones in some fields , any more than foxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact the managements of many large corporations are acutely aware , for business reasons , of the desirability of " sticking to their last . " For instance the Bell system has shucked off its developments in radio and sound movies , and most recently , with some sentimental wrench , in hearing aids , since these were what started Alexander Graham Bell on his telephone experiments . But " our business , " say telephone men , " is two-way communication . Period . " Some of the giant oil companies have kissed off developments in chemicals into which their laboratories were leading them ; on the other hand the president of du Pont recently said . " We feel that the chemical industry is our business . . . where we can make a substantial technical contribution . that is our opportunity . Where we do not make a substantial contribution , we leave it to others who can . " Nor is big business as impervious to trouble and failure as some people fear ( or hope ) . Like the sequoias , big firms reach their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biology , by casualties . A nearly 20 per cent mortality of managements of large companies since 1930 may be reassuring to those who fear big business will take over the earth . The relations between big and little business seem  --  again to resort to biological analogy  --  to involve less competition than cooperation , and mostly " symbiosis . " More men are employed selling , servicing , and repairing cars than in making them . Some of the giant firms have thousands of suppliers and thousands of customers . T HE present effort to protect the country against a danger which may not be as bad as feared , involves heavy cost and risk , especially because of the way it is being done . The law is confused . Innovation is discouraged . And the consumer may get hurt . And whether or not the danger is as great as some people conceive , the present method of preparing against it sometimes has the earmarks of frivolity . Thus in a bare 5-4 majority the Supreme Court recently upset the legality of seven thousand dealer contracts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil , automobile , farm machinery , and other industries . Congress should have the say on such things . This was the case in which Justice Jackson , dissenting , was moved to say that the judicial process " is not well adapted to the exploration of such industry-wide and even nation-wide questions . " And the Supreme Court majority itself remarked in the Columbia Steel case : " It is not for the courts to determine the course of the nation 's economic development .

The inspector A Story by John . Fraiser Robinson Drawings by Lou Block As HE drove along over the rocky gravel roads winding through cutover longleaf pine , red clay banks and past shabby shotgun houses , the inspector , on his way to investigate today 's case , kept thinking of yesterday 's  --  the suicide of a young man , younger than himself . There had not been much of a clue as to motive , only that he had failed in his first business venture , timber cutting and logging in a hilltop corner of the county  --  too small a thing , everybody said , since any number of people would have lent him the money he needed . To the inspector it all seemed circumstantial and useless and the words of a grocery clerk he had interviewed kept recurring to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked . " Why , he could have dug ditches and lived . " He had been counting off the houses as he passed and now he stopped before the one he was looking for . The house was painted white on the front , the sides were raw pine with a rash of knot whorls like a thousand eyes . Zinnias filled the flower beds on both sides of the front door , the flowers pinched and old before their time , starved for water , blooming prema-parched death advancing . up their lot next to this one sloped upward , of houses , crowned with pines , a few trees very tall . The lot was covered all over with dark round mounds of Cherokee roses , solid and assertive , pushing out long tentacles of white single flowers , surviving from times when they and the pines were part of the virgin Forest , A path , worn into a ditchIike rut , wound into this maze of bushes  --  they towered above it twice as high as a man 's head . The inspector only glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that short time a rabbit jumped from one bush to another , signing the air with a flourish of white tail . The heat lay visible in waves . He closed his eyes and still the glare went up in rings under the lids . Taking a notebook out of his pocket , he swore at the sight of his soggy shirt sticking to his body . Still sitting under the steering wheel , he flicked the pages until he came to one marked " Jim E. Thomas  --  Urgent . " He read the notes from the home office of his company and the questions at the end : " Is double indemnity involved ? Was our insured the aggressor ? " Opening the door of the car , he put one foot out . " Christ , I hope she does n't cry , " he said , the thought making him feel suddenly tired . He reached for the car key and it fell to the floor . Leaning over to pick it up there flitted through his mind an irrelevant and fragmentary scene  --  something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came up with the key , there was a faint smile of self-satisfaction on his face , and in his eyes a sudden tenderness and a sort of dependence  --  dependence upon the world . M RS . Thomas answered his knock on the door . She was a frail woman and walked in a stooped , hurried fashion , rubbing her hands together as though to keep them warm . She had a pinched , driven face and hair that was a tangled mixture of black and grey , like dead moss . " Oh ! " she said , as though relieved and the inspector was someone expected . " Come in out of the heat . " He tried to tell her who he was and why he was there but she seemed to take it in only vaguely , as though she never understood at all , as though understanding were not necessary . " I declare it 's so hot today , " she said , pulling forward a chair . " Ill just leave the front door open . " They sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pine boards of the wall exuded drops of resin . A magazine cutout was pasted on the wall before him , a colored picture of a barefoot boy fishing in a miniature pool , a dog beside him . Mrs. Thomas perched stiffly on her chair . She fumbled at arranging a wrinkled scarf on a folded-up sewing machine . Behind her a vanity dresser , oak-veneered , garish , ambitious for this room and house , reflected the movement three times . A kewpie doll , baby and harlot obscenely mixed , stood in front of one mirror , its fat hands extended in a coy gesture , as though playfully repulsing a lover . The inspector wanted to be sympathetic but he never could hit on any satisfactory professional attitude . Besides interviewing widows , he often had to consult undertakers about dead bodies , and his many experiences with their reception  --  the limp hand extended , the voice too quiet , too full of concern  --  had led to a manner more brusque than he intended . But for Mrs. Thomas no overture was necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , now pushing forward another chair . " I forgot that one 's got a rickety leg , " she said . " I been trying to get Junior to fix it . " She sat down again , pushed at her hair , folded her wrinkled hands on her lap . It seemed to the inspector it was the hands " Seems like once started he could n't stop . " that were waiting . He shifted self-consciously . " Well , Mrs. Thomas , suppose you just begin at the beginning and tell me what happened , how long you were married , what led up to the  --  his death  --  just the whole story , if you please . " " I will do my best , " she said . " The Lord knows what a trial it is to me but I try to be cheerful around the children . The Lord wo n't put upon us more than we can bear , they say . " How long we are married , you say ? " she began , thoughtfully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months this coming Tuesday . My first husband died and Mr. Thomas and his first wife divorced . I never did know why . He never said and I figured it was none of my business to ask . Drink , I reckon . I have two children by my first husband , none by him  --  Junior and Eula Lee . Junior is eighteen and Eula Lee will be sixteen next month . " Mr. Thomas was a good man when he was n't drinking , a man to be around his home . He built this house with his own hands , laid off from the mill a month . But he would drink on pay day . When he cashed his check , he would have a drink and seems like once started he could n't stop . Then he would get mad and seem to see everything different from what it was . We would all try to please him then . He would say things " I could hear him breathing hard . " that did n't make sense . His people said he was part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he would fly off the handle and the way he liked knives . He always carried a knife on him . Two months ago he drew the butcher knife on me and looked like he was going to cut me . I run out of the kitchen and all the way to my sister 's house  --  Mrs. Scoggin , down the road . Christmas time last year he come into our room , the front room there , and I was sleeping on the bed . I did n't even know he was home and when I looked up , he was standing over me with that two-bladed sharp knife . I screamed and jumped up and he laughed and slashed a hole clear across the counter-pin . I can show you . I sewed it up but you can still see where it was . He would lay down and grit his teeth when he got mad . " T HE inspector tugged at his damp collar . He had been studying a cactus plant on the window sill , a cluster of tight , small spheres in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , " she continued . " I stayed home most of the day and then about laying-off time I got Mrs. Brimmer next door to go with me to meet him . We come on home from the mill and later we went to town to the grocery store , him and me , and paid our bill and got our groceries . Then Mr. Thomas said we would go to the saloon . I did n't want to as I do n't drink , but I went and drank one bottle of beer with him . I had to buy Eula Lee a hair ribbon then and I went to the dime store . When I come out , he was gone . I waited and when he come back I knew he was drinking and I told him please not to drink any more . " She reached out again to even the scarf on the sewing machine . The inspector wiped his face and folded his wet handkerchief . " He did n't start to get mad until we got home . That was about six o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen he was getting mad so I just put the things away quiet-like . He went out the back door and stood in the chicken yard , then he come back through the house and went out the front door . He mumbled something about going back to town . I did n't want people to know there was any trouble so I did n't try to stop him or call him back . I just went out to the edge of the lot and watched him down the highway . He did n't look back . When he was out of sight I knew there would be some trouble but did n't think it would amount to so much . " I waited about an hour , all the time getting more worried . Junior had robbed a wild bee hive and I tried to pick out the bees from the honey  --  you know how they all fall in the honey and drown when they are being robbed . Then I called to Mrs. Brimmer and asked her if she 'd go with me to look for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . I went back in the kitchen and cut me a piece of pie and then I heard somebody at the back door . I looked around and saw Mr. Thomas had come in . " He said : You have n't gone to bed yet ? ' I said : ' No . ' He said : ' Why ? ' I said : ' Because I was afraid to go to bed by myself . ' He started cussing and calling me names . ' Where 's Eula Lee ? ' he said . ' Gone to the carnival with Velma , ' I said . He got real mad and said : ' A hell of a raisin ' she 's getting from you . You 'll make a  --  lie called a bad name  --  out of her yet . ' I asked him if he wanted me to fix him some coffee . He said : ' No , I do n't want you to do anything for me . ' " I knew he was bad drunk then . I stayed in the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . I heard him pulling off his clothes and tearing them and throwing away his shoes . I passed through the room and noticed that he was lying on the floor nekkid with a pillow under his head . " I fooled around a bit , I did n't want to go to bed . There was only him and me there and I just did n't know what to do . I unlatched the back screen and went around to the front and sat on the front steps and put my ear to the door to see if I could hear him sleeping . I could hear him gritting his teeth and breathing hard . I eased up from there and went back to . the kitchen and cut a piece of pie and laid it on a plate to take to Mrs. Brimmer . Just as I started out I heard him getting up saying : ' The back is open . ' " I stepped behind some clothes I had hanging in Eula Lee 's room to dry . He looked for me but did n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing he was getting madder , I went in . He did n't say anything , just kept putting on his clothes . I got my shoes and clothes off in a hurry and got in bed so he would see me , thinking he would go to bed . " He was hunting for his shoes and I asked him what he wanted . ' I 'll show you , ' he said . Just then Junior come in and said : ' Mr. Thomas , what are you doing ? ' " Mr. Thomas turned on him and said : Where have you been ? ' He started cussing Junior . I could see Junior getting mad and I said : ' Junior has n't been anywhere , ' and I motioned Junior to go on out . From that we got into an argument about Junior and he said I let Junior and Eula Lee run around all night and that I was running after Gus , that 's Mr. Scoggin , my brother-in-law . He always talked about Mr. Scoggin when he got drunk . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up  --  a long time ago . That was Long ago in Mississippi . " He was sitting on the bed . It was almost nine o'clock I guess , I did n't look at the clock . He looked at me kind of funny , then , all of a sudden , grabbed one of my arms and I saw he had his pocket knife open . I broke away and run out the back door to Mrs. Brimmer'shouse . I run up her back steps and tried to open her screen but it was hooked and before I could get away he caught me . He twisted my arm and the next thing I knew I was back here and I was nearly dead , my heart is so bad , and he still had a-hold of me . " She put her hand to her flat chest and touched a breast-pin that was yellow gold with one murky diamond in a grimy setting . " I told him to please get the doctor , I was smothering to death ; so he turned me loose . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1 could hear him going from room to room plundering through drawers , looking for something in the dark . I cut on the lights . " ' Where is my knife ? ' he said . ' I do n't know , ' I said . It was the dirk knife he was looking for , I knew , sharp on both sides . ' Get it right now , ' he said . I made like I was looking for it and when I got near the door I run out the back and to Mrs. Brimmer 's house . " I stepped behind some clothes I had drying . "
