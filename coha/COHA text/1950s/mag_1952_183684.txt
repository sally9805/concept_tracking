In moviemakers ' jargon , a " lap dissolve " consists of a movie scene slowly fading out while the next scene builds up right on top of it . According to M-G-M Production Boss Dore Schary , one of history 's most fascinating lap dissolves happened in 1620 when the Pilgrims on the good ship Mayflower faded out at Plymouth , England , and appeared 96 days later , anchored off what was to be Plymouth , Mass . Nearly two years ago Schary set M-G-M Scripter Helen Deutsch to digging into all the facts and legends about the Pilgrims ' mysterious voyage . The result , Plymouth Adventure , was finally on film last week . <P> If M-G-M has , as it claims , helped set the record straight , graduates of U.S. high-school history courses are due for a surprise . In the movie , only 40 of the Mayflower 's 102 passengers are separatists from the Church of England , fleeing King James I 's persecution . Even those refugees emerge as an earthy , red-blooded lot . The rest of the voyagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever set sail . Aboard is a young cooper named John Alden ( played by Van Johnson ) , who keeps the passengers ' whisky and beer barrels in repair . Captain Myles Standish is below-decks most of the time ; Researcher Deutsch decided that Standish was already married and probably not courting Priscilla Mullins . <P> None of the goings-on aboard the movie 's Mayflower is in the popular tradition of the Pilgrim Fathers . The big romance is between Captain Christopher Jones ( Spencer Tracy ) and the seductive Mrs. Dorothy Bradford ( Gene Tierney ) . wife of the colony 's Governor-to-be William Bradford . By the time the ship drops anchor in Plymouth Harbor , Dorothy and the captain have done a little light romancing and she takes the easiest way out of the triangle by drowning herself . <P> All in all , the Pilgrims ' transatlantic high jinks , may not be absolutely factual history , but Producer Schary hopes the film will be " a contribution to the American idea . . . " In Massachusetts , Henry Hornblower , president of Plimoth Plantation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not yet know the worst . " I suppose , " says he , " that the movie will show Priscilla spinning . There is no evidence that a spinning wheel was brought over on the Mayflower. "
