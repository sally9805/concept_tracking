OPS last week gave the Ford Motor Co. the green light for a price boost averaging close to 5% on 1952 models . But Ford said no thanks . Instead , Ford boosted prices a scant 3% on most models , actually reduced prices slightly on three . Ford was following the lead of General Motors , which did not take the full hike permitted by OPS under the Capehart Amendment . <P> The auto men could still change their minds and revise prices up to the ceiling . But they were taking no chances of pricing their cars out of the market . In the past six years , car prices have risen enough to cause many a motorist to think twice before turning in his old car on a new one . Sample factory list prices on four-door models : <P> 1946 1952 <P> Ford Customline $1,004 $1,685 <P> Buick Super " 51 " 1,397 2,245 <P> Chevrolet Styleline Special 894 1,533 <P> Cadillac Series " 60 " 3,099 4,323 <P> Pontiac Chieftain 1,434 1,995 <P> Chrysler New Yorker 1,945 3,135 <P> Plymouth Cranbrook 1,225 1,689 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,040 <P> Prices in 1946 rarely included extra equipment such as radio , heater , etc. , while some of the 1952 prices do include extras . Auto men quote factory list prices ( usually Detroit ) , but to figure out his bill a motorist must add on shipping charges , taxes and equipment which is optional . These charges to a customer in New York , for example , can push the bill up as much as $700 on low-priced cars and $1,300 on high-priced models .
