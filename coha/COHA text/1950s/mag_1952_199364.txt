As primary day neared in New Hampshire , Dwight Eisenhower 's forces spread across the state to speak for their man . Pennsylvania 's big Senator Jim Duff , Ford Foundation President Paul Hoffman , Connecticut Governor John Davis Lodge and Kansas Senator Frank Carlson were out on the campaign trail . Television 's Tex McCrary was roaming the mountains and valleys with a troop of entertainers , which included Tony Lavelli , onetime Yale basketball star ( he shoots baskets at rallies ) , Maestro Fred Waring , Entertainers Les Paul &; Mary Ford . Tex 's wife , Jinx Falkenburg , was there ( " as a wife &; mother " ) to decorate the scene . <P> No Snow-Under . As the campaigners whooped if up , the Eisenhower organization 's national manager , Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , was anything but overconfident . He knew that Governor Sherman Adams and some other big-name Republicans would be elected as Ike-pledged delegates . He also knew that the polls showed Eisenhower running ahead in the preference race . But he realized what many an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory just because top Republican brass of the state are in his corner . In the lower echelons of the G.O.P. organization , there is many a Taftman , and Bob Taft is not going to be snowed under . A defeat for Ike or a narrow victory would be a serious blow to the key argument that he is a winner and that Taft is n't . That argument blared last week from 21 billboards along New Hampshire highways : " A vote for Ike in March means a G.O.P. November . " <P> The Taft bandwagon was ready for a threeday , 500-mile swing through 20 cities and towns . With most voters thinking about the March 17 income-tax deadline , Bob Taft will dwell on two of his favorite subjects : Government extravagance and high taxes . As the Ohio Senator campaigns , 26 strategically-placed billboards will call attention to Ike 's non-campaigning status : " We 're for Taft because we know what he stands for . " <P> " Be Human . " On the Democratic side , Tennessee 's Senator Estes Kefauver was driving along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wintry main streets , drawling , shaking hands and winning votes . Harry Truman 's friends , suddenly worried , hammered together a campaign . They hit something , not necessarily a nail , on the head with a slogan : " Be human , vote Truman . " <P> Next Tuesday , New Hampshire voters will gather for town meetings to decide local issues ( e.g. , should the old covered bridge over the Contoocook in the town of Boscawen be demolished ? ) . Then , with the political eyes of the U.S. on them , they will step over to the polling booths to 1 ) select delegates to the national conventions , 2 ) cast their ballots for the man they prefer for President . By next morning the first real straws will be eddying in the 1952 political wind .
