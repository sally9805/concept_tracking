txt  | become identified thereby . Thus the contemporary young man no longer sees in a pretty girl a pleasant companion with whom he can enjoy himself in flirtation , and to whom he may make love eventually if they find that they appeal to one another , but an object , not even for proper intercourse , but for petting ' . He has no use for purity or restraint : on the contrary , he demands that she must be sexy ' : she must , in fact , conform as closely as possible to the image of the Blonde . The girls , with lipstick , brassieres and skin-tight trousers , do their best to comply , and nowadays we find the greatest ladies apeing the allurements of the prostitute . The social questions involved in all this are outside the scope of this work : I wish merely to indicate that the problem of sexual behaviour represented by the Blonde is a very real one , and that it is becoming increasingly widespread . From the social point of view there are two sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least the merit that it is an attempt to abolish the harsh distinction between pure ' and fallen ' women , with all that that implied , which disfigured the Victorian era . The question with which we are concerned here is that of the psychological background , for the Blonde , as we shall shortly see , represents far more than mere sexual behaviour . In the Blonde we are dealing , not with objective woman as she actually is , but with the image of woman in the mind of man . Women , being by nature pliable and desirous to please , will do their best to conform to the ideal set up for them by men , but that is beside the point . Our interest lies in what man wants , or believes that he wants , as it is revealed in the pictuxle of the Blonde ; and this is not because of its effect on his sexual behaviour , which is a comparatively minor point , but because of the light it throws on his general mental attitude . In the Blonde he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own lust ? a figure supremely portrayed in Swinburne 's Faustine . There have been all kinds of other ideals of womanhood . At various times and places it has been customary for men to see her as austere and queenly , as ethereal , or as gentle and submissive ; man has sometimes been moved to regard woman as a sublime mystery , sometimes as an ideal of purity , and  | sometimes as the source of his inspiration or of his sins . It goes without saying that all these notions are merely projections and have nothing whatever to do with objective women as they actually exist , for women have always been , as they are today , ordinary , self-contradictory human beings , very like men . What we are concerned with , therefore , is a content of the mind which is seen either in projection , in the form of the pin-up girl and her flesh-and-blood equivalents , or else directly as an inner image ? as the Blonde . This erotically-toned image of the recognition-elements of the mating pattern , representing the outer form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mating pattern and all the higher mental aspects of man 's relationship to her , is , of course , nothing new . In a later volume we shall find that it was an important component in the make-up of the classical goddesses : the Blonde , in fact , differs very little from Aphrodite ? or , paradoxically , from Artemis , who was anything but chaste . Individual men have always known her , but she has not always corresponded with the collective ideal . In the Middle Ages , for instance , although as the Lady Venus she was still well known , the emphasis was placed on a very different aspect of womanhood ? that of the Queen of Heaven . The Lady Venus , moreover , in her appearances as the Lady of the Lake , the queen of elfland , Melusine etc. , is not only a sorceress but also the repository of supernatural wisdom  --  an attribute notably lacking in the Blonde , with whom the adjective dumb ' is pre-eminently associated . We are interested in discovering why the image of woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time . Is it merely the consequence of Freudianism ? I think rather the reverse : the theories of Freud are to be regarded as one of the consequences rather than as the cause of the general attitude . To what , then , is the latter to be attributed ? We shall shortly see that this generalized symbolical image of woman which appears spontaneously in the minds of men has been identified by Jung as an Archetypal image which he has named the Anima , and we may anticipate here by using this term for convenience of reference . The answer to our question is best to be found by putting it in another form : what does the Anima want ? What does she seek to achieve by  | presenting herself in this guise ? We have just noted that she has other roles at her disposal ; why , then , does she prefer at the present time to adopt that of the Blonde ? I am not , of course , naively imputing conscious motivation to a disembodied content of the mind , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the purposes of the symbol itself is a valuable one which will be constantly used in this study , and the reader must familiarize himself with it . Provided that we accept the proposition that such phenomena have any purpose at all i.e. that they are produced for a purpose by something , whatever it may be ? it is clear that this approach merely represents a convenient abbreviation . We say , for instance , that the purpose of the telephone-bell is to inform us that a call has been put through , but nobody will accuse us on that account of imputing conscious volition to the bell . We know perfectly well that the purpose , in the strict sense , resides not in the mechanism but in the minds of the officials of the telephone service who have had the bell fitted ; in the last resort , indeed , it is to be found in our own minds , those of the subscribers , who wish for audible notification of a call . The answer to the question why is the bell ringing ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to me ' . It is not strictly correct , for it should be the bell has been fitted so that I may know when somebody wishes to speak to me , and it is ringing now because a connection with my line has been made at the exchange ' ; for it may , after all , be a wrong number . But such a form of words is superfluous and cumbersome , the short answer sufficing , for people who are familiar with such devices . Similarly the question why is the Anima behaving in this way ? ' is because she wants such and such ' , and this will suffice for those who are familiar with the theory of the Archetypes . The full answer would be the Archetypal symbols have been evolved with the purpose of bringing to the notice of the conscious mind certain mental situations which it has no other means of learning about . The Anima is now appearing to the conscious mind in this form because the condition associated with it obtains . ' If it be asked in whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol resided , the answer is that it was in our own , just as it was in our own minds that  | the purpose which produced the telephone-bell existed . But just as it was not the conscious mind of any particular subscriber which caused the bell , or the telephone service , to be introduced , but the sum total of the requirements of all potential subscribers , most of whom had never consciously considered the question , so are the Archetypes the product of the collective unconscious mind . Humanity as a whole requires certain information regarding what is going on in the unconscious part of its mind , and so it has unconsciously evolved the Archetypal symbols : they have a purpose , although that purpose was never consciously formulated in any individual mind . This method of treating the Archetypal symbols as living , purposeful entities has also the advantage , as Jung points out , that it helps us to objectivize and visualize the influences which they represent . The speedometer in a car does not only provide factual information : it also helps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per hour which , hitherto , have been mere abstractions to him . As a driver he must learn to deal with them as practical realities , and if he approaches the question in the light of the idea that the purpose of the speedometer is to tell him when he is going too fast , then the process is greatly assisted . In the matter of symbolism we are all novices , and the concept of the mental factors represented by , say , the Anima , are far harder for most people to translate into terms of reality than is that of abstract speed . The novice must first convince himself that they exist at all , and it is often easier for him to do so if he treats the symbols in the same light as outerworld realities . These symbols , as we have seen , really do behave in a characteristic , significant and apparently autonomous manner , just as the pointer of the speedometer does , and what we have to discover is what their behaviour means ; in doing so it is helpful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , perfectly legitimate to ask what the Anima wants when she appears as the Blonde , provided only that we bear in mind the fact that the wanting does not , strictly speaking , reside in her , since she possesses no independent mind , any more than the telephone-bell does . Her desires are the desires of an aspect of the collective , unconscious part of the human mind , in which all individual minds participate . Her purpose , then , is obviously in the first place to draw  | attention to herself , since she makes use of the recognition element in the mating pattern for which man is permanently on the alert , whether he wills it or not . This implies that she ( the Anima , not objective woman ) is in danger of being neglected or overlooked ; when she presented herself as the Queen of Heaven she was in no such case : what she then required was evidently respect and reverence , but today she is prepared to forgo everything else provided only that attention is paid to her . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater danger of forgetting their sexual nature today than they ever were : it is not simply with the purpose of promoting sexual intercourse that the Blonde is making such a parade of her sexuality . It might be contended that in the aftermath of Victorian morality men are still in danger of paying too little respect to the sexual side of life , and the fact that the Blonde is so particularly conspicuous in the Anglo-Saxon countries , in which the repression and humbug of Victorian morality was carried to its greatest extremes , lends colour to this suggestion . In most parts of the Continent a far more broad-minded and realistic attitude towards sexual questions obtained throughout the nineteenth century , and in these places the cult of the Blonde is less developed . That , however , is only the superficial aspect of the matter : the significance of the Blonde goes far deeper . Carrying the matter to a higher ( or perhaps deeper ) plane we may seek the answer in that inexplicable tendency of the Blonde 's , which we have noticed in No Orchids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counter to the simple wish-fulfilment ' of sexual intercourse : she is not prepared to remain in the crude and ignoble role of the blonde in black pyjamas : she aspires , evidently , to become something more than a mere appeaser of male concupiscence . Here , on the superficial plane , we may find a statement of the personal problem of those men whose interest in women is solely erotic ? those who habitually short-circuit the intermediate , approachand-courting elements in the mating pattern , in order to proceed direct from recognition to coition . This , as we have seen , is probably contrary to the true instinctual pattern , although that can not be taken as scientifically proved ; however  | that may be it unquestionably does violence to those elements of the image of womanhood which have been added to the instinctual nucleus in the course of human mental development . These , as I have suggested , form part of the collective unconscious and are unconsciously and involuntarily absorbed by everybody from his mental environment . However cynical he may believe himself to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself from the influence of the feeling values which have grown up round her figure in the course of centuries : I refer to such matters as the respect and protectiveness due to her , the challenge which she represents , and the respect and confidence which must be won from her in return . These things , together , probably , with the characteristic instinctive responses of courtship , form an integral part of the universal image of the Anima which exists potentially in every man 's mind ; if his relationship to women is to be satisfactory he must bring them to consciousness and do justice to them . It is not , however , solely a question of a man 's relationship to women , important though that is , but of his whole feeling life . It is noticeable that all the elements mentioned , even including the instinctive responses of courtship , are matters of feeling as contrasted with the intellect or the senses . The inference , therefore , is that the Blonde 's purpose when she insists on her temperament and her sentimental demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to raise these aspects of the totality of her nature to the surface : here we find part of the explanation of her appearance in an incomplete form , either with her lower half concealed , as behind the counter , or as a mermaid in which it is not yet humanized . The Blonde , in fact , is an incomplete version of the Archetype of the Anima : a version in which the feeling values have been overlooked and remain concealed in the impersonal unconscious . Once again , however , this matter is not confined to sexual behaviour , nor even to a man 's general relations with women , for the feeling life extends to far wider spheres . The trouble is not simply that his feeling relations with women are inferior and inadequate , but that his whole feeling life is ; that is the general cause of which the defective sexual pattern is merely a consequence or special case . This question of the repression of one or other of the mental functions is a wide one with which  | we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jung 's theory of the mental functions and psychological types will appreciate the point , which will be considered in detail in the next volume of this series . It must suffice for the moment to say that thinking and feeling are opposites , and where the one is cultivated to excess the other is habitually repressed ; men tend ( although there are plenty of exceptions ) to prefer thinking to feeling , and women ( although also not without exception ) the reverse . To man , therefore , woman , as his opposite and counterpart , tends to symbolize the feeling life in general ; since her image also stands for the unconscious mind , and the greater part of his feeling life is often inaccessible in the unconscious , the symbolism has a double application . In the unconscious the feelings degenerate and become inferior and often dangerous , which explains Slim 's sadistic tendencies ; in order that this condition may be cured it is necessary that the domination of the one-sided , repressive conscious attitude be broken and the feeling life as a whole accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with civilized values and refined by the higher part of the mind . What this means in terms of life will not be clear to those who are not acquainted with Jung 's system , but it is unfortunately impossible to elucidate the matter at this point . This brings us to part of the explanation of Miss Blandish 's mission : she must descend into the underworld of the unconscious in search of her counterpart and lover , who has been denied access to the world above , in order that she may raise him to the light of consciousness . It is not merely the personal problem of those individuals in whom the feeling life is repressed by an intolerant conscious attitude based on the function of thinking , but the problem of the age , for we have raised the intellect to the position of an infallible divinity , and are in serious danger of losing our psychic equilibrium in consequence . That is why it is so vitally important that the Anima should draw attention to herself and beguile man , by any means , however unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does so there is at least a chance that she may be able to teach him the error of his ways . As we have already noted she is wise after her manner , although at the moment she is studiously concealing the fact in order to avoid arousing the mistrust of men .  | Lastly , moving to a plane still higher , or deeper , we may consider the Blonde 's role of guardian of the door which leads through the Barrier . This is a matter concerning which we have not yet collected enough information for a full discussion , but I may anticipate by saying that it is a matter of the Two Worlds , or of man 's two natures , the one individual , the other generic . As I have suggested above , in our obsession with personal consciousness we have largely cut ourselves off from our universal roots , which are to be found in the unconscious mind , and this is an even graver danger than our loss of feeling values : some of its more serious implications will be discussed later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoble externals of the Blonde , stations herself at the door in order to lure men into the world of the Other Side . If they trust her and understand how to deal with her she will act as their guide in these mysterious regions , and they will be able to return to This World wiser , freer , and possibly in possession of the Treasure of wholeness . The Anima , who is the Queen of Heaven as well as the hashhouse waitress , is , as we shall see shortly , nothing less than man 's soul . We have seen her as a mermaid rising from the waters of the unconscious in search of the love of man , in order that she may win a soul : that is only another way of saying that she is man 's soul seeking the completeness that only his love can give her .  | NO Orchids is the record of an expedition beyond the Barrier into the world of the Other Side , and the predominant characteristic of that world is that it is devastated by the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first conspicuous , for the earlier episodes of the story are concerned mainly with the abduction of Miss Blandish ; it is true that that at once leads to a conflict , but at first it is only the enmity between two gangs with which we are concerned . But as the story progresses , and the writer penetrates more deeply into the hinterland of the Other Side , the dichotomy crystallizes out into the opposition of two clearly defined parties , each representing definite principles : they are the upper world of John Blandish and the underworld of Ma Grisson . Once these two characters emerge the conflict assumes larger proportions and eventually envelops the whole scene : it reaches its climax in the pitched battle between the Blandish police army and the Grisson gang in which the latter 's stronghold is taken by storm . The situation , we have seen , has its mythological prototype in the Persephone myth in which the princess of the upper world is also ravished by the ruler of the underworld , and we can now discern another parallel : the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plot may therefore be regarded as Archetypal , that is to say as representing a fundamental mental pattern , and we have now to attempt to discover in what this schism of the mind consists . Attention has already been drawn to the way in which the  | theme of dichotomy pervades the book : not only is it manifested in the conflict between the opposing factions for the possession of Miss Blandish , but also in the division between This World and the Other Side ; it is , however , important to appreciate that these two cleavages are not identical : the two halves into which each of them divides the totality of the world of the mind are not the same . This point is of vital importance in the study of the mind , and failure to appreciate it has led to many misconceptions . It can best be illustrated by the analogy of the sphere . Parmenides envisaged the totality of all things ' in the form of a sphere , and this image is of great and far-reaching importance . The sphere is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view ; no point on its surface is inherently distinguishable from any other point ; and it is the body which contains the largest volume for a given superficies : regarded as a container it holds the maximum possible content . For these reasons it has always been the symbol of perfection and completion , for however one looks at it it remains the same , no part of it has greater significance or importance than any other ( as , for instance , the apex of a cone has ) and its content can not be increased by any change of shape . It is the essence of wholeness . As a result of these properties it is possible to divide a sphere into halves along an infinite number of planes and the result will always be the same : we obtain two hemispheres similar in every respect to one another and also exactly similar to the hemispheres resulting from bisection along any other plane . This is the position in its purest and most absolute form : it suggests that in whatever way we divide the totality of Being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall obtain basically the same result , that is to say two halves which are fundamentally interchangeable and which are always capable of reunification into the same perfect whole . We may , for our own purposes , differentiate between the two hemispheres by colouring one of them red and the other blue , but such a distinction is superficial , arbitrary and fundamentally irrelevant : i The ent ' or essence of Being , which is imperishable , whole , indivisible , continuous , unchangeable , perfect and evenly extended in every direction : therefore a sphere .  | ultimately , on the highest plane , where such accidentals are of no account , we are left with two perfect halves , indistinguishable from one another and whose only characteristic is that they are halves of the perfect Whole . The image is strikingly expressed in the famous passage on the origin of sexual love in Plato 's Symposium . Aristophanes describes the original human beings as follows : Secondly , the shape of each human being was wholly in the round , with circular back , circular sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one head with two faces looking opposite ways , four ears , double genitals and everything my description implies.l Jove then bisected each being as men slice apples for pickling , or cut eggs with a hair ' , turning the faces and subsequently the genitals to the inner ' side of the resulting hemispherical beings . The consequence was as follows : Now , when their natural state had been bisected , each half yearned for and tried to approach the other ! Round each other they threw their arms , entwining themselves in their desire to fuse . . . . As our study progresses we shall find the significance of this symbolism confirmed in one example after another : I may anticipate by saying here that the figure of a single human being , divided vertically , each half revealing the characteristics of one of the sexes , and with two heads , or two faces on one head , is the conventional image of REPIS , the double thing ' of medieval alchemy . The basic meaning of this picture is the division of the original perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the desire for reunion ' between the halves , which arises from the actual incompleteness of each in itself , and from the ever-present , potential completeness which consists of the union between the two . The union of the sexes is pre-eminently the symbol of this union between opposites which are at the same time counterparts of one another ; their union results , of course , in restoring the original unity in the form of the child . We are dealing here with a figure of the mind , not with a Footnote  | mere allegory of the facts of biology . If regarded in the latter light the parable would be merely silly ; the appearance of the sphere , in any case , denotes that there is more in it than that . This is only a single particular case of the general principle of dichotomy in which , instead of colouring our two hemispheres red and blue , we have named them male and female . And , incidentally , Plato maintains that there were originally three sexes : double males , double females and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halves of an androgyne , but the bisection of the other two produces male and female homosexuality . In other words we have here a statement that the two halves are really indistinguishable : that union with the counterpart is in the last resort the subject 's union with himself , seen from a different viewpoint . If the subject identifies himself with maleness then he necessarily has a counterpart which appears as female , but it is perfectly possible , as we shall see later , for him to identify himself with femaleness , or with the androgyne , instead . The trouble about this wholeness , seen as the sphere , as an object of thought , is that its parts are all indistinguishable from one another and its form invariable from whatever point of view we regard it . We can think of it only as an undifferentiated whole , and beyond that point we can make no progress . But in order to live we must see the world as something distinct from ourselves with which we can establish relationships , and here already we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemispheres of subject and object , or self and not-self . With the implications of this differentiation we shall be concerned later . Again , in order to understand life we must endow objects of our experience with individuality , seeing them as identities over against the remainder , which is everything else , but not the identity in question . Proceeding further , we discover similarities and dissimilarities between the various identities which we have established : one class is living , the other inanimate , one pleasant , the other unpleasant , and so on : here we have further dichotomies into classes or categories , each consisting of a pair of opposites . The functioning of the conscious mind , in fact , consists basically in discrimination , which means the dichotomy of the totality of experience , or Being as it presents itself to us , into pairs of opposites , each of  | which implies its counterpart . With this theme we shall also be concerned later : it is sufficient for the moment to indicate that conscious life may be symbolized as a continuous series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind all appearances , and which contains all possibilities in an undifferentiated state within itself . The result of carrying out this process over a period of years may be visualized in the image of a private reproduction of the absolute , universal sphere , and this is the personal mental world of the individual in question . This replica , however , differs from its universal prototype in that the individual has made it comprehensible to his own perceptions by arbitrarily identifying points on its surface and establishing their relations to one another . The result is something like a terrestrial globe , the uniform surface of which is marked off by lines of longitude and latitude and covered with a complex pattern of identifiable areas . It is now no longer immaterial from what point of view the sphere is regarded , nor along which plane it is bisected : each bisection , although still producing two hemispheres of identical form which retain the property of potential reunion to re-establish the perfect whole , is characterized by the different marked areas which are separated by it . To take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it along the Equator we obtain the conventional northern and southern hemispheres , the peninsula of India being contained in the former . If , however , we tilt the plane of bisection through some twenty degrees , so that the point on the line of cleavage nearest the North Pole is on the same longitude as India , the latter area will now be included in the hemisphere containing the South Pole . The two new hemispheres differ very little from the former two and may still reasonably be designated northern and southern , but the slight difference in the plane of bisection has resulted in the transference of an important area from one to the other . In the mental world such a transference may be exemplified by a man 's attitude to , say , his own body . Seen from certain points of view it is part of the hemisphere of self as opposed to that of not-self , but if the viewpoint is only slightly changed it becomes part of the outer world from which the subject , seeing itself as a mind , is separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , is treating his body as something external to himself on which he is working very much as he might on a horse which he was preparing for the same purpose . During the actual race , however , his viewpoint changes and he is identified with his body , which becomes part of himself as contrasted with his competitors ; he now no longer stands over against it as an object , deciding that this will be beneficial for it and the other harmful , but is identified with it in the effort which mind and body are making in unison . ( Sir Winston Churchill brings out this point in a passage in World Crisis in which he says that a horseman should train his horse as though it were worth ten thousand pounds and ride it as though it were worth half a crown , an analogy which he applies to the utilization of military and naval forces in war . ) Failure to understand this matter leads to false identifications . Thus , if we divide the sphere of totality into male and female , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very similar but not identical . Failure to appreciate the difference leads to such false assertions as that the masculine is ' positive and the feminine negative . As an approximation this statement may be serviceable , but it is no more strictly true than would be the assertion that the feminine was beautiful and the masculine ugly , the former dark and the latter bright , or true and false , heavy and light , or any other irrelevant pair of opposites . We have to guard against the tendency to pick out one particular line of bisection and to attempt to understand everything in its terms : philosophers , particularly , are liable to attempt to force the whole of existence into such Procrustean beds . Each dichotomy is individual and unique and the resultant pair of opposites differs , however slightly , from every other pair . Only the fact of dichotomy itself , and its specific and irreducible implications , are universally valid : these are the production of a pair of opposites which are the counterparts of one another ; between them there is tension which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposites of repulsion and attraction , hatred and love ; and finally the opposites inherently contain the potentiality of fruitful reunion . In No Orchids the sense of duality which pervades the story represents the principle of dichotomy and the resultant tension  | in general , but the two forms in which we have so far found it expressed represent two distinct cleavages . That between This World and the Other Side represents the division between two modes of the mind , the personal and the universal ( or generic ) respectively ; that between the factions of John Blandish and Ma Grisson , on the other hand , is the conflict between the principles of constituted authority and the rebellion of the dispossessed . We may now turn for further information on the subject to the persons of the two leaders of the factions , who are the representatives of the principles concerned . THE CAUSE OF THE CONFLICT We have already noted that both Blandish and Ma make their first appearances as disembodied voices on the telephone ; this reveals that they reside in the further reaches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are always present in the background . Furthermore , we have seen that once they appear the latent conflict , which has been in the air from the start , flares up and involves everybody even the empty-headed Blonde is compelled to take sides . Here again we have the symbolic representation of an important characteristic of the mind . The process of differentiation by bisection of the sphere is essentially a working of the conscious mind . In the collective or universal part of the unconscious mind , the nature of which we shall consider later , the process of discrimination has not yet been applied : its contents , therefore , exist in a state of undifferentiated potentiality in which the opposites have not yet been separated out and the tension between them has not therefore come into existence . It is only when any such content reaches the conscious mind that the latter seeks to make it intelligible by splitting it up into pairs of opposites . Thus there exist in the mind two departments , or areas , or modes of functioning , in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet being seen in the light of the polarities self ? not-self , subject ? object , particular ? universal , good ? bad , inner outer , spirit matter and so forth , whereas in the other everything is so seen and is thereby allotted a place in the personal scheme of ideas and values . This dichotomy has always been known to mystical thinkers  | and is symbolized in the tau ' cross : T. This figure indicates that the area above the horizontal line is undivided , whereas that below is bisected by the vertical into the pairs of opposites . The horizontal is the Barrier . Another version is to be found in the ancient Egyptian ankh : . Here the loop at the top is a distorted circle , signifying the sphere of undifferentiated totality ; the figure appears again in the astrological symbol for Venus : c . Mental progress is achieved by raising ' contents from the undifferentiated area into the light of consciousness , thereby assimilating them into the personal world-picture or personality and subjecting them to the control of the Ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lying below ' that of consciousness : it is the universal or collective unconscious seen as the sea , the mother of all things , the contents of which are captured and brought up into the light by the function of intuition just as the fisherman catches and lands fishes . With the symbol of the fisherman we shall be concerned again . The three symbols illustrated above , on the other hand , show the undifferentiated area lying above ' the differentiated : there it is regarded as the realm of spirit ' from which divine inspirations and revelations descend ' into the world below . The difference is only one of viewpoint . As we shall see later the admission of contents to consciousness is controlled by a selective mechanism , itself unconscious , which has been built up by the individual , and arbitrarily so constituted that it excludes whole categories of experience from consciousness . We can not go further into the matter at this point , but any reader of maturer years will probably be able to remember how in the course of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded , revealing to him whole departments of mental experience of which he has hitherto been completely unaware : it may have been music , or other people 's feelings , speculative thought , religious experience , or something more concrete such as the delights of gardening , the refinements of cooking , the joy of possessing exceptional or beautiful objects , or the practice of some art or handicraft . Looking back it is hard to realize how one had hitherto lived in total ignorance of all the richness of experience and the living implications of one 's discovery ' : how all awareness of them had apparently  | been witheld from the mind without one 's knowledge or consent . These are cases of spontaneous and felicitous adaptations to the mind 's inherent tendency to expand the area of consciousness by assimilating contents of the unconscious : cases , however , often arise in which the conscious attitude opposes obstinate resistance to such assimilations . The reasons for this will appear later ; for the present we must be content to accept the fact that the situation occurs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of the selection of conscious contents and the class of content thereby denied admission : it is as though a doorkeeper who had received orders to exclude all candidates for admission having certain characteristics were fighting with an indignant mob of such people clamouring to be let in . The doorkeeper , and the authority which has issued the orders which he obeys ? in other words the mechanism governing the admission of contents to consciousness ? are themselves unknown to the conscious mind : the conflict , in fact , is taking place wholly in the unconscious . The conscious mind is not aware of the existence of a conflict , for the latter exists only in a latent or potential condition , only becoming manifest in the state of tension and exhaustion which it produces . Here we have the explanation of that atmosphere of depression and drained vitality which we have noted , and which provides the incentive for the venture into the hinterland beyond the Barrier in search of the Treasure of renewed life , energy and decisiveness which has disappeared into it . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conscious discrimination into dark regions normally inaccessible to it , and the effect of such illumination is that the opposites , hitherto concealed in the unconscious , immediately become apparent and fly apart . All the latent tensions and hostilities inherent in the situation flare up and become actual , leading to a savage battle in the conscious mind . Such penetrations of the Barrier , therefore , are dynamic and often agonizing experiences ; they are also dangerous , and that is the basis of the theme of the forbidden door in the fairy-tales : ' Footnote  | the hero always opens it , thereby falling into great danger and suffering , but he sometimes succeeds in securing the Treasure . For if the conscious mind is strong and adaptable enough to retain its identity and sense of orientation in the midst of the turmoil of the great forces which it has unleashed , their confrontation and coming to grips with one another acts as a discharge of tension . Even if the Treasure is not secured and slips back , like Eurydice from Orpheus ' arms , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longdrawn devitalization of suppressed conflict . Something has been achieved in the uprush of repressed forces , and it often takes the form of a creative work . If , however , the conscious mind fails to contain and master the powerful figures which erupt into it from the unconscious , some form of personal catastrophe ensues . The subject becomes possessed ' by blind forces which usurp the control of the conscious will , and he is either driven to symbolical and ultimately self-destructive actions or succumbs to suicide , neurosis , or at best neurotic collapse . Creative work is a dangerous activity , but needs must when the devil drives . FATHER AND MOTHER John Blandish and Ma Grisson are the remote focal points of the two opposing factions . It is noticeable that they never meet ; they never even encroach on one another 's territories , for Ma throughout the story never leaves her premises , and when Blandish wishes to join in the pursuit of his fugitive daughter and her lover he is turned back by Fenner . Both are Archetypal figures : Blandish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of No Orchids is no less , and he is specifically described as the meat king ' and essentially the Father . Ma is no less a queen , for she has carved out a kingdom for herself in the underworld . She has created the gang which controls it : The Grisson mob was the most vicious murder machine in the State . Ma had built it up and she was proud of it . ' And of course she is essentially the Mother ? the mother of Slim , the villain-hero . We do not see very much of Blandish personally , but throughout the story we are aware of his authority . Right from the start it is of him that the gangsters are afraid , for the police are  | no more than his agents : He ( the gangster ) began to realize that this job was going to be big . . . . He could imagine how tough Blandish would get with the cops ' ; or : If we rub her out her old man will spend every cent to catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could dig up would make us dizzy . ' And Blandish himself is implacable in his hatred of the underworld : " I think my daughter is dead , " Blandish said quietly . " I hope she is , otherwise . . . . " ' And immediately afterwards : " I want those men caught . I do n't want them to get away with this . I should be more satisfied if they were killed than arrested . " ' His daughter 's honour ? that is to say , his own honour ? is dearer to him than her life , but his hatred of the underworld is the strongest motive of all . In his person Blandish represents the grim world of the industrial West . Its moral virtues are those of the godly , righteous and sober life : industry , respectability , purity , toughness and a shrewd common sense : a successful ideal , but a narrow one . We see it all expressed in his portrait : Just above middle height , a thin face , clean-shaven , and heavy jaw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Deep-set , in dank sockets , they were hard , shrewd and vital . ' He is cold , impersonal and unfriendly ' . One imagines him dressed in rusty black , a Bible under his arm : the personification of sour Puritan intolerance . Ma resembles him in many respects : grim , unscrupulous , authoritative , determined and power-loving , she is his replica . Only in the activities they favour are they diametrically opposed , for Blandish represents respectability , chastity and orderliness whereas Ma cultivates licentiousness , lawlessness and all the vices . Some of these characteristics are not revealed in their own persons but in those of their minions : Fenner , for instance , displays orderliness and chastity , for he has an office in which he sits during the conventional hours , whether he has anything to do or not , occupying himself by repulsing the advances made by Paula his glamorous secretary : on one occasion he explicitly declines to make love to her during office hours ' . This chastity of Fenner 's is important : we have seen that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without succumbing to the blandishments of the blonde who guards it . He is the one character who is free of both worlds , it  | being explained that in his previous career as a journalist he had got to know all the hoodlums . He has the right of entry , which Blandish and the police have not , but he can enter freely only when he goes alone : as soon as he comes accompanied by the police army the underworld resists , and although the resistance is eventually overcome , the effort , as we have seen , is fruitless , for when the victors at last penetrate to the innermost citadel they find that Miss Blandish , the Treasure , is no longer there . Nevertheless , by his impregnability to the advances of the Blonde , and by his determination and toughness , Fenner is able to preserve himself in safety in the underworld , and it is he who discovers the Treasure although he fails to secure her , for , like Eurydice , she slips back into the darkness . Ma , likewise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but apart from racketeering she runs a night-club in which every kind of luxurious dissipation is practised ; it is she , also , who brings about Miss Blandish 's debauch by Slim . Now in stories which we shall examine later we shall find this theme of the estrangement and conflict between King and Queen , or Father and Mother , recurring . In Rose Macaulay 's The World my Wilderness we shall find the couple playing exactly the same roles , the father representing conventional rectitude while the mother personifies the amoral , orgiastic principles ; but in Dickens ' Great Expectations the roles are reversed . We must , therefore , be on our guard against ascribing the roles of arbiter of rectitude and of anti-moral rebellion to Father and Mother respectively as representatives of the male and female sexes . We have noted that the similarities in character between Ma and Blandish outweigh the differences ; confining ourselves , therefore , carefully to the deductions permitted by our material we are entitled only to the following conclusions . First that this couple , as man and woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union ; secondly that instead of being united by love they are separated by hatred ; thirdly that they are powerful and authoritative figures ? in fact parents . But it seems probable that in the specific roles they play as leaders of the warring factions they may be interchangeable . This point may perhaps be explained if we turn to the instinctual basis of the images .  | THE GREAT ADULT Unlike a foal , a lamb or a duckling , an animal which , like the human baby , is born in a helpless condition , is under no necessity to identify its mother . The young animal does not have to follow the mother about ; the mother either carries it with her or deposits it in a safe place and visits it in order to feed it . It is safe to assume that an instinct which is entirely valueless to a species will not be found to exist in it ( unless , of course , the loss of value is due to an artificial change of environment ) : it is therefore highly probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to identify any single being as mother ' , that is to say as the protective , nourishment-providing centre of youthful existence . By the time the child has grown sufficiently to get about on its own its intelligence has developed to a stage which enables it to identify a number of beings as such , its mother among them ; by then , of course , if she does happen to be the being who exclusively cares and provides for him she will have come to occupy a special place in his world , but only as one person among others ; there is no justification for assuming any inherent tendency to make a mother-projection ' as such , in the way that the duckling and the foal do . We are , moreover , far too apt to assume that the artificial picture of the family ' consisting of mother , father and children is something fundamental . Human beings have always lived in communities , and pre-human beings almost certainly in herds ; the primitive household , moreover , is generally a large one , accommodating several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move independently , and hence to get into trouble , the relationship of greatest importance in preserving it from danger would be that to other members of the herd in general rather than to its two specific parents . It is , therefore , a fair conjecture that the child would be equipped with an innate instinctive impulse to imitate , follow and obey any adult human being , with whom it would tend to take refuge when afraid . This surmise seems to be supported by the actual behaviour of young children , who are extremely accommodating in the matter of attachment , being prepared to accept the ministrations and authority of almost anybody who approaches  | them in the right way . Unfamiliarity may for a moment arouse their mistrust , but they very soon habituate themselves and are often no more and no less attached to nurses , servants , aunts and others with whom they are familiar than they are to their own parents . As a contrast to this it should be observed how a lamb which has wandered away from its mother will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , passing numerous other ewes without a glance , or how the foals , in a herd of horses on the move , remain close to their own mothers . If this is a true picture of the human instinctual pattern in the matter we may assume the existence of a single mental figure of a very indeterminate nature towards which the child would tend to manifest the reactions of seeking protection , imitation and self-subordination . Such a figure would necessarily possess the quality of authority which would evoke the related feelings of trust and dread , submissive love and its converse , rebelliousness ; it would be experienced both as the terrible arbiter of rectitude and the incitement to sin , as loving protector and stern judge . As to its external characteristics , it need only be human and large : its sex , in particular , would be indeterminate . Here , evidently , we have something which might have served as the nucleus around which there crystallized the figure of the Semitic paternal ' deity and his counterpart Satan , originally seen as two manifestations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , truly paternal ' , but rather parental ' , for the feminine element in the composition of Jahweh is revealed in the symbolism of the Ark and the Mercy Seat ; subsequently it splits off into the independent figure of Wisdom ' or Sophia in the later Hebrew canonical scriptures , and of the Glory of the Lord , or Shekinah , of the Kabbalists , who is seen in female form . I shall call this figure the Great Adult . In my opinion it provides the basis of all superordinated or authority-deities who , as a class , are distinct from the deities based on other inherent images , such as those of the mating and other patterns to which humanity is predisposed . I must , however , make it clear that I do not for a moment advance this theory as an explanation ' of the nature of Deity or Divinity as such : to do Footnote  | so would be to adopt the typical superficial reductive ' attitude . But to advance a theory designed to explain why human beings experience the principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ultimate nature of that principle than a theory concerning the mechanism of the eye and its effect on the images which we see is an explanation of the nature of light . We are concerned for the moment only with the nature of the human mind which interprets the essence or principle in the form of images with particular attributes . A differently constituted mind would form different images of the same essence or reality , just as an abnormal or differently constituted eye would do . When the figure of the Great Adult is brought to consciousness it is necessarily split into pairs of opposites , and this dichotomy appears to tend to follow one of two planes of cleavage : that between male and female and that between good and evil , or constituted authority and rebellion . The former produces the Father and Mother images , the latter those of God and the Devil . The second of these dichotomies may produce a pair of deities of equal status , as in the Ormuzd and Ahriman of the Zoroastrian system : these I shall call the Upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as belonging to the same sex , in which form we shall meet with them later . The Father and Mother form of dichotomy involves the sexual images , which have basically nothing to do with the Great Adult . The resultant figures are therefore composite : Authority plus Man ( King ) and Authority plus Woman ( Queen ) respectively . As such they give rise to mixed and unsuitable projections in which elements pertaining to the relationship between the sexes are entangled with others belonging to the relationship to authority : in the subsequent course of this study we shall find examples of the troubles to which this confusion may lead . The theory , incidentally , offers an alternative explanation of those phenomena which the Freudians have interpreted as fixations ' on the figures of the personal father and mother . In No Orchids both forms of dichotomy have taken place : Father and Mother , or King and Queen figures have appeared and have been allotted arbitrarily to the opposing factions of upper world , representing constituted authority , and of under-  | world , representing rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite allocation . It is possible that personal factors play their part in the choice , but if so they are accidentals and we need not trouble with them . For the time being we must assume that Father and Mother are interchangeable . THE TERRIBLE MOTHER The question still remains why Ma , whose prototype in Sanctuary is more of a humorous sketch than a vision of horror , should have become something so very repulsive , evil and dangerous . The explanation is to be found in part in the nature of an Archetypal figure to which Jung has drawn attention , giving it the name of Terrible Mother . Out of deference to the conventional attitude towards motherhood she is more commonly seen in the role of Wicked Stepmother , or , even more closely disguised , as a monster , dragon or wild beast with which the hero must do battle . Jung has given a large number of examples in his Wandlungen and Symbole der Libido , ' and others will appear in later chapters of this study , in which the significance of the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard her simply as the shadow side of the image of motherhood . The light side of the Mother , the guise in which we like to see her , is that of a protective , lavishing , nourishing , wise , provident , guiding and prolific principle , but this representation necessarily implies its opposite , the shadow side . This negative or dark aspect of motherhood derives from the awareness of individual separateness , of the position of the living organism over against its non-individualized environment . Physical life represents a perpetual effort on the part of the individual organism to maintain itself in a state of differentiation from the great inorganic world . Let the effort once fail and the physical body loses its coherence : its carefully regulated temperature equalizes itself with that of its surroundings ; the complicated and unstable molecules of its chemical constitution break down into simpler forms ; the law of Entropy asserts itself and the few pounds of matter that had borne a living intelligence merge back into the millions of tons of unintelligent matter from which they were once drawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely the same with mental life : consciousness arises Footnote  | from the great undifferentiated mass of the collective unconscious ; it burns more or less brightly for its allotted time and finally decomposes into the materials from which it was drawn , which return whence they came . Its maintenance is a perpetual effort , from which we find relief in sleep , and at last release in death . Thus the Mother , from whose body we once drew the constituents of our own , stands for the great earth from which all living bodies are formed ( And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground , and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life ; and man became a living soul ) . She is also the great sea of the collective unconscious , in which the individual consciousnesses swim like fishes . To return to her is rest for the weary , but it implies also extinction for the spark of consciousness . In the last resort the personal self is nothing but a coherent stream of consciousness , and what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else . Therefore we also fear the Mother , for she is the Abyss and the darkness which comprehendeth not . In this respect , therefore , the Mother is an object of fear , and in another she is an object of loathing . The Blonde is an artificial synthesis of all the elements which are erotically pleasing in woman and I have already indicated that such a selection leaves a number of other constituents of the inherent image of the opposite sex unaccounted for . These consist of those elements of the mating pattern which have no direct erotic value , and which , from the erotic point of view , are irksome and undesirable . These , being excluded from the conscious ideal , sink into the unconscious where they tend to crystallize into a shadow image of womanhood , representing her as possessive , exigent , tyrannical , parasitical and so forth . Personal , objective experiences of women are similarly divided , attractive elements being incorporated in the conscious ideal while everything distasteful and repulsive is relegated to the unconscious , where it associates itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images of the hideous old hag and other distasteful aspects of femininity . Ma Grisson , therefore , is the shadow side of the Blonde , as repulsive as the latter is beguiling , as harsh and intractable as the Blonde is amenable , as overbearing as she is submissive . We have seen how Chase , evidently with an uneasy feeling Footnote  | that the blonde in black pyjamas lacked something of full femininity , experimented , in the person of Anna , with some of those less welcome characteristics which , as of course he knew , do occur in objective women . Anna is not entirely submissive : she has a temper ; and she is not satisfied with endless sterile couplings with her lover : she begins to hanker for some more binding arrangement . But then the author begins to have misgivings and has Eddie ruthlessly reduce her to order . The most revealing episode , however , is that in which the Blonde makes her brief appearance as a fat girl . Here the writer , feeling that the unbroken succession of perfect figures was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced the Blonde to accept a typical feminine shortcoming : the tendency to run to fat . The consequence is startling , consisting in the sudden materialization of Ma with her tommy-gun . Evidently the insistence on the anti-erotic quality of fatness has activated the shadow image , and the fat girl is virtually transformed into Ma , thus revealing their underlying identity . Thus it becomes apparent what the quest of the complete nature of the Blonde entails : it is nothing less than reconciliation with Ma Grisson . That means not only the acceptance of the less enjoyable , even the less edifying aspects of femininity , but a coming to terms with the whole collective unconscious with all its terrors . Before leaving this figure I wish to emphasize again how easy it is to fall into error by presuming the existence of parallels between the inner and outer worlds before it has been conclusively shown that they exist . It is clear that the complex figure of Ma Grisson contains an element of motherhood and , proceeding from that point , it is all too easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the particular , characteristic relationship of the child to its mother in the outer world . But this relationship , as we have seen , has virtually no counterpart in the inner world , since the human child is almost certainly not equipped with any innate motheridentification pattern . The characteristics of Ma derive partly from the relation of the conscious to the unconscious , partly from that of man to woman as mate , and partly from the innate tendency of subordination to authority . The element of motherhood occurs only in the first of these , and then only indirectly , in symbolical form .  | DEADLOCK AND RELEASE The latent conflict between the opposites personified in Blandish and Ma which cast its shadow over the opening scene amounts to a mental deadlock . The position , as already indicated , is that the conscious attitude , represented by Blandish and the principle of constituted authority , is obstinately refusing to allow the assimilation into the conscious mind and personality of a whole category of experience . The explanation of the nature of this discrimination must be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with indicating that in the present case it is connected with the feeling life . That is why the courtship , matrimonial and parental elements of the mating pattern are unacceptable : they are matters of feeling relationship as opposed to erotic attraction . Jung , on the basis of clinical experience , tells us that this situation is the essential cause of neurosis . It derives from the fact that the conscious attitude ( which , as we know , is itself unconscious until the attention of the conscious mind has been drawn to it by an outside agency ) has built up a set of prejudices against certain categories of experiences and functions which are inherent in the mind . These it sincerely regards as inferior , unreliable , misleading , dangerous and repulsive : at best trivial and foolish and at worst definitely evil . Consequently it rejects this type of experience , flees from it , combats it and attempts to suppress it altogether . But its efforts are worse than useless , for the functions and modes of experience in question are as much an integral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of the body : it is impossible to eliminate them , and the attempt to do so only arouses inner resistance : in a serviceable analogy which must not be taken as a scientific statement , we may say that this attitude provokes ' the elements discriminated against to hostile activities . These may take the form of obsessions , compulsions and similar neurotic symptoms , or simply of devitalization , depression and general misery . When this situation obtains Jung shows that the conscious mind is not only helpless , but that its attempts to deal with the condition can only aggravate it . Every conscious effort implies an intensification of the repressive conscious attitude and hence an added provocation of the repressed elements , which react  | with increased hostility . The action of the conscious mind is essentially discriminative , and therefore the more the problems in question are revolved in consciousness the more widely are the opposites sundered and the greater grows the tension between them : the possibility of reconciliation grows more remote than ever . In these circumstances a solution can only be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical experience that it does offer suggestions which , if accepted by the conscious mind and followed in practice , do in fact cure the condition . He has named this mode of activity of the mind the transcendental function ' because it transcends the strife of the opposites and thereby brings about reconciliation and the restoration of the lost unity of the personality . Its working may be visualized as a direct intervention by that Centre of being which must of necessity remain intact for as long as individual life lasts . The schism between the opposing and sundered halves of the personality may go very deep , but if it is followed downwards far enough the point of union in the Centre must at last be reached , and from this point it is possible to take a truly impartial view of the conflict which does justice to both sides and from which it is therefore possible to formulate a solution which satisfies both of them . The solution , however , is not produced by the conscious mind except in so far as it makes itself receptive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies , so to speak , in the innermost recesses of the unconscious : it can not itself by any possibility become conscious since its essence , being absolute unity , precludes the differentiating function which is the essence of consciousness . It is That regarding which we can predicate nothing and which is therefore always inaccessible to our thought . This matter will be considered in closer detail later . The solution emanating from the Centre , therefore , always appears to consciousness as corning from outside itself : it may be in the form of an inner image appearing in a dream , vision or fantasy , or which simply writes itself into ' a story or other work , or it may appear in the form of a projection on to an outer object which suddenly acquires significance of an unexpected kind . But , whatever the form of its appearance , it is certain to give the impression of something new and unfamiliar , or something demanding a fresh approach , hitherto untried ;  | for its very essence is change . In consequence it will evoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reluctant to accept it , but everything depends on its finding the insight and adaptability to overcome this reluctance . Frequently the new departure demanded of the conscious mind takes the form of the acceptance of something hitherto despised or feared , and of this we shall find numerous examples . Maud Bodkin , in her Archetypal Patterns in Poetry , draws attention to the exposition of this situation in Coleridge 's Rime of the Ancient Mariner . The Mariner , having committed the crime of shooting the albatross , is becalmed : he has , in fact , reached the condition of deadlock and is stuck fast . In this situation he is in danger of dying of thirst , as his shipmates in fact do : in other words he is cut off from the waters of life ' , an old and fundamental symbol of the life-giving powers of the unconscious with which we shall meet again . Attention has already been drawn to the condition of being parched and exhausted in connection with the opening scene of No Orchids , and the theme is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world during her daughter 's absence ; it occurs again in a slightly different form in Wagner 's Ring of the Nibeiungs which will be considered in a later volume . As the Mariner suffers the torments of thirst among his dead companions he sees loathsome creatures in the sea , from which he averts his eyes in disgust : The many men , so beautiful ! And they all dead did lie : And a thousand thousand slimy things Lived on ; and so did I. I looked upon the rotting sea , And drew my eyes away . . . . Then the moon rises and he is overcome with a sudden love for the creatures of the sea : O happy living things ! no tongue Their beauty might declare : A spring of love gushed in my heart And I blessed them unaware : Sure my kind saint took pity on me , And I blessed them unaware . After this reconciliation he finds himself able to pray again , the  | shameful corpse of the albatross , which had been hung about his neck , falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . While he sleeps it rains and he is refreshed ; then the wind springs up and the ship moves once more . Maud Bodkin , in a detailed analysis of the emotional effect of the various passages , states that several readers of the poem have confirmed her own impression that the atmosphere of hopelessness and depression which pervades the account of the becalming is suddenly lifted by the line which tells of the moon 's rising : it is in fact the appearance of the feminine principle in her pure and celestial form which breaks the deadlock . Coleridge , in his marginal notes , places this matter beyond doubt . These are the relevant items : ( The Mariner ) despiseth the creatures of the calm , And envieth that they should live and so many lie dead . In his loneliness and fixedness ( i.e. the deadlock ) he yearneth towards the journeying Moon . . . . By the light of the Moon he beholdeth God 's creatures of the great calm . Their beauty and their happiness . He blesseth them in his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the holy Mother , the ancient Mariner is refreshed with rain . Here , evidently , we have a complete account of deadlock broken by the love and acceptance of something hitherto despised and rejected , and it is the holy Mother ' who reveals to him the unsuspected virtue , grants him the power to love and to pray , and at last restores to him the waters of life and the ability to move onwards . No Orchids is a very different story , and yet , as we have seen , it is the appearance of Miss Blandish which brings new life to Footnote  | the situation and transforms the trivial tale of a jewel robbery into the fantastic epic of the rape of Persephone or Helen and the siege of the Paradise Club . Her relationship to the holy Mother ' will shortly become apparent .  | HAVE already spoken of the way in which Miss Blandish outgrows her prototype , the shallow and vicious girl of Sanctuary , . Ind of the strange respect with which her creator handles her . It would , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numen of divinity surrounds her , but there are moments , as when Rocco penetrates to the upper floors of the Paradise Club and finds her in her luxurious prison , which have at least fairytale magic about them . They are followed by such brutal scenes as Slim 's coupling with her on the bed in Rocco 's flat while the owner 's freshly murdered corpse lies on the floor beside them , but that again leads to the unexpected moments of pathos in the epic flight and Slim 's last stand . The writer has left the painstaking realism and the subtleties of Sanctuary far behind , and , in a way , has risen above them . Miss Blandish 's sordid humiliations somehow acquire dignity as essential constituents of a high destiny . Miss Blandish 's superior status is expressed in a symbolical form : she is habitually to be found upstairs , and , as I have already mentioned , Slim is constantly to be found climbing stairs : in two cases in order to reach her . And we may note a second point : for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as she is brought down the killing starts . It is worth giving a summary of these descents and their consequences . When she is first abducted she is taken by her captors to an upstairs room in their hide-out : they try to conceal her there , but Slim arrives and orders her down . Her descent is vividly visualized , and it is followed immediately by the killing of all  | three members of the first gang . The Grisson mob then remove her to their headquarters , where they hold her captive in an upstairs room , and for so long as she remains there , which is for a considerable time , virtually no killing takes place . On the contrary , Slim , instead of ordering her down to him , begins his career of stair-climbing , and eventually wins her love ( even though it is only with the aid of his mother 's drugs and rubber hose ) . Then she is removed to the new Grisson premises , the Paradise Club , the topography of which is described in some detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maisey , the blonde , and beyond it are the club rooms , the scene of the luxurious debauches which characterize the underworld and culminate in Anna 's strip-tease act . Upstairs , ' in the author 's words , was nobody 's business . ' There , in a private room , Miss Blandish is held captive . Every night , in the small hours , Slim brings her down for a walk , and for so long as she is in his company all is well . But one night he is away and one of the minor gunmen deputizes for him : he is promptly murdered by Rocco , who removes Miss Blandish to his own fiat , and there he , in turn , is murdered by Slim . Slim 's ascents to Miss Blandish 's room in both houses are described with a wealth of detail altogether disproportionate to the outer significance of the act , and in order to gain access to Rocco 's flat he has recourse to the service lift , which is a peculiarly striking visualization of the theme of ascent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels , but nowhere is he seen coming down : there can be no doubt that the theme of ascent is intimately associated with his figure . From Rocco 's flat he takes Miss Blandish down for the last time , and the final battle begins . They escape in a stolen car , and after various vicissitudes we find them trudging together up a mountain road . They rest together at the top , exhausted and woebegone , sitting side by side at the road 's edge ? an unexpectedly touching spectacle ? and then they set off down the other side to their deaths . At last they are cornered in a barn , and Miss Blandish , upstairs again ( this time in the loft ) watches Slim below her as he exchanges shots with the police . Suddenly she retires from the trap-door , and it is then that Slim virtually commits suicide . He marches out into the open and is shot down . The inference to be drawn from this pattern is that Miss  | Blandish belongs on a higher plane than the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason which we have yet to discover but which , we may already surmise , has something to do with Slim . This descent , however , implies the dragging down of the ideal to a lower level and it is followed by suffering and strife ; worst of all , the majesty of John Blandish , the King , is dishonoured and his authority defied , and that entails the mobilization of all his powerful forces of repression . The better solution is for Slim to struggle upwards to Miss Blandish 's level . We have now to ask what it is about Miss Blandish that sets her in so high a place . In the first place , of course , she is the King 's daughter , a princess and the heiress to all the power and riches of the upper world . But there is something else which is even more important , and it is revealed at her first appearance . Here is the description of her impact on the gangster Bailey on that occasion : She was unspoiled . That was what got him more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls he had run into before . She had everything they had and then a lot more . ' What she had is shortly revealed by Eddie , reporting to headquarters : She 'd a lot of red hair , a figure like a bra . advertisement and enough oomph to give a corpse wicked thoughts . ' Except for the red hair it is simply the picture of a super-glamorous blonde ; yet she had a lot more ' : she was unspoiled ? in other words a virgin . The Glamorous Blonde has never been a virgin : her first experience of love , whenever we meet her , always lies far behind her in a nebulous past . In Kafka 's Trial , which we shall consider later , she appears on one occasion as a misshapen little girl of whom we are told that in spite of her youth she had already been debauched . As Athene was born fully armed the Blonde comes into the world already soiled . She is also sterile , for the element of motherhood has been carefully excluded from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : as a virgin she is potentially a mother , and it is a mother , to bring forth new life , that the situation requires . With her appearance the vicious circle of endlessly repeated sterile matings with the incomplete Blonde has been broken . Miss Blandish is complete because she has not yet been touched , and now she is in search of a lover .  | THE SPLENDID TALE OF PRINCE DIAMOND We have noted that bloodshed ensues whenever Miss Blandish comes downstairs , and now we may note another form in which this fatality which attends her is revealed , and that is that every man who comes into contact with her is killed . To begin with it is the playboy who was her escort on the occasion of her first abduction , then her three captors , then the gunman who deputizes for Slim as her escort for her nightly exercise , and who is killed by Rocco , and finally Rocco himself . Only Slim is exempt until the very end , and then it is not until Miss Blandish at her trap-door withdraws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we shall see shortly , he had already accomplished his destiny : Miss Blandish 's withdrawal , otherwise unmotivated , may be taken as confirmation of the fact . Slim , evidently , is her fore-ordained lover , and for him she is reserved : every other man who seeks to take possession of her is destroyed . The theme of the princess whose unsuccessful suitors lose their heads is a familiar one in the legendaries of all peoples . We may now examine one such tale as a reassurance that we have not gone astray in our exposition of the universal elements in No Orchids . It is taken , once again , from the Arabian Nights , and is called The Splendid Tale of Prince Diamond . The story is presented in that vein of ribald bawdiness which is typical of so many in this collection , but the elements of the original legend are clearly discernible . It relates how Prince Diamond hears that the hand of a beautiful princess is offered to the royal suitor who can answer a riddle which she has propounded . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already suffered it , he resolves to try his fortune , and he refuses the offer of his father the king to send him with an army with which to take the princess by force . Here , already , we have a parallel with No Orchids , for we have seen that the attempt to win the Treasure with the aid of the forces of constituted authority is useless : she , and the kingdom which goes with her , can only be secured with her consent , won by the merits of her lover alone . Diamond immediately penetrates the Barrier , in the form of the wall round the palace garden , by means of swimming under it through a conduit ? a striking image of the passage down-  | wards ' into the waters of the unconscious ; inside he meets the princess and her girls , and both she and her favourite attendant fall in love with him . The latter offers herself in marriage , which he promises , but only after he has successfully answered the riddle ; in return she informs him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that it is he who has propounded the riddle , and that its answer is to be learnt only in his remote homeland . Diamond therefore sets out for this distant kingdom , and on the way penetrates into no less than three successive walled gardens , each inhabited by a princess of ravishing beauty who offers herself to him ; in each case he promises marriage , but only after he shall have succeeded in his quest . One of them , a Circe figure , transforms him into a stag , and he has difficulty in escaping from her garden ; his attempts to do so by jumping over the wall are fruitless , for he always finds himself inside again , and it is not until he discovers the door through it that he is successful and is restored to human form . This theme of the difficulty of returning from the Other Side will concern us later . In the course of the quest Diamond slays numerous negroes . At last he successfully discovers the answer to the riddle , which concerns the estrangement of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the girls as he passes , and on reaching the palace of the original princess he marries first her favourite and then the princess herself , although she is discredited by the discovery of the negro under her bed . The latter , needless to say , is slain by Diamond . It is probable that the numerous marriages have been added , in a late recension , for the sake of the opportunity they offer for salacious descriptions of their consummations ; the essential is that Diamond refuses all the advances of the Blonde in her various embodiments until he has completed his quest . The parallels with the theme of No Orchids are obvious : apart from the quest itself and the penalty for failure we have the repeated penetrations of the Barrier and the invariable discovery of the Amorous Blonde behind it , the necessity of abjuring dalliance with her until the whole quest has been completed , and the theme of the estrangement between king and queen which lies at the back of the whole complex . A  | characteristic of the underlying Persephone situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark figure under her bed : the legend as a whole , however , is inferior to the others which we have discussed in that no attempt is made to deal seriously with the implications of this awkward element , which is simply brushed aside in the conventional happy ending . It is in points such as this that we are justified in discriminating between superior and inferior versions of a mythical theme in the matter of their faithfulness to the matter of symbolical truth . Judged from this point of view No Orchids must be rated high , whatever its defects from the aesthetic or moral viewpoints may be , for its author never defers to the conventions or to sentimentality by distorting the situations which his intuition presents . We can not say the same for some among even the greatest masters of literature : in our study of Dickens , for instance , we shall find constant evasions and distortions of unpalatable truths ; we shall see , moreover , how the attitude of mind which led to such inner untruthfulness revenged itself in the disfigurement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , although it is no more than a superficial and perfunctory tacking together of symbolical elements into a salacious romance , is of value as showing how , in an environment as remote from that of No Orchids as the Islamic culture of the middle ages , the identical symbolical elements have coalesced into the theme of the Quest . THE DYNASTIC UNION The male is not without the female , and conversely the female is not without the male : the very existence of Miss Blandish presupposes that of her lover , and we have already seen how he was , as it were , drawn up out of the darkness of nonentity by her appearance . The essence of Miss Blandish , however , is that she is singled out as one partner in a very special and fateful union . The casual copulations of the Blonde have always been a superabundant feature of life on the Other Side , but they are unsatisfactory because they are both unworthy and sterile : now a longing is making itself felt for something higher . The new union must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must therefore embrace those elements which are lacking  | in the nature of the Blonde , and these are symbolized in the first place by the high origin and the purity of Miss Blandish , the virgin princess . But if the fruit of this union is to fulfil the great demands which are made of it , which are nothing less than the resolution of the conflict which is devastating the inner world , the princess 's partner must be no less carefully selected than the princess herself . The project contemplated is no less than the reconciliation of the irreconcilables , and in order to bring it about the partners in the union must each embody and personify one of the contending factions . That is the reason why Miss Blandish 's lover can be nobody else than Slim , for if she is a princess , the heiress to the upper world , he is no less a prince and the heir to the lower : only through the union of these two can a total and complete reconciliation be effected . The theme is the old one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fairy tales , and one which forms the basis of Romeo and Juliet . But Montague and Capulet , in conformity with most of the fairy-tale versions of the contending factions , are seen simply as antagonists in a traditional feud : there is no disparity between them in status or worthiness of aim , and the conflict between them has no material basis . In order to reconcile them it is only necessary to transform their traditional hatred into love , and thereby to show them that they have no real grounds for contention : they have only to forget old scores in order to realize that it will be more beneficial to both of them to live in amity and concord . This problem is difficult enough , but it is overcome by a device of the psyche with which we shall meet again : it consists of the evolution of what might be described as a special organ of attractiveness by the offending or repressed principle , which is thereby presented to its opponent in a beguiling and desirable form which disarms him and causes him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the last resort , is what the Blonde herself is : she represents the bait held out by the spurned and neglected Other Side , or collective unconscious , in order to persuade the self-obsessed personal mind to approach it in a conciliatory spirit . T his device , however , is not proof against the selective powers of the conscious mind , which may succeed in nibbling off the bait without swallowing the hook :  | it concentrates on those aspects of the Blonde which are compatible with its purposes and ignores the rest , which are relegated to the unconscious where they build up into the threatening figure of Ma . In order to free itself from the unsatisfactory situation which ensues it is necessary for the personal mind to undertake the quest of the Blonde 's full nature , or in other words to make a determined effort to unearth the roots of the conflict . Passing through the Barrier and ignoring the Blonde in her familiar incomplete aspect it must penetrate into the interior of the Other Side , where it discovers the contending factions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now apparent that the trouble lies in the strife of these equally matched opponents : neither will ever succeed in permanently suppressing the other , so the only solution lies in reconciling them . The means to this end also lie to hand , for now the Anima appears in the fuller and higher form of the virgin princess , heiress to one of the kingdoms . Reconciliation can therefore be achieved by her union in love with the prince , heir to the opposing party , who is her foreordained lover and who must necessarily exist by virtue of her existence . The venture is a difficult one , for it is essential that none but the right lover shall take her . He must , therefore , first be found and identified , and then prove himself worthy of her , and it is for this reason that such difficult conditions are attached to the suit and that the penalty for failure can be nothing less than elimination . If the personal mind accepts this situation all is well . The conflict is seen as a futility which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear , and it is taken for granted that the prince should be in every way worthy of the princess : handsome , brave , highly born , virtuous and wise . Union in an ideal love then follows as of necessity . But if the personal mind takes sides in the conflict the problem remains unsolved . The opposing factions , in this case , no longer appear as of equal status and worth , and one or other of the lovers is consequently seen as inferior to the other . Their love is no longer an ideal union hindered only by the prejudices of the older generation : it becomes something dangerous and wrong , involving the risk of the victory of the inferior faction . Nevertheless it has to take place because it is dictated by forces in the collective mind  | which the personal mind is powerless to circumvent : it runs its course , therefore , in face of the horror and misgivings of the latter . It is clear that this is what has taken place in Sanctuary , and the theme was taken over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proved too strong : they have caused the personal mind to side with the Father , whose regime , although recognized as oppressive , harsh and intolerant , is still seen as essentially right and superior . There is nothing at all to be said for the other side , which appears solely vicious and evil : no compromise with it can possibly be considered . The longedfor reconciliation , therefore , does not appear in the form of a happy union between two idealized lovers , but as the sordid humiliation of the princess by a loathsome ravisher . No good could possibly come of such a union , which is accordingly abandoned in despair . Yet , if her creator could only have brought himself to see it , Miss Blandish , in her short sojourn in the underworld , gives considerable proof of her powers of ennoblement and reconciliation . She succeeds in inspiring pity and admiration in the hearts of several of its inhabitants , and in the heart of Slim she inspires love . Only Ma remains implacable in her hatred , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Blandish , which is the cause of the failure of the venture . The root of the trouble is that the figure of the Father is still too strong . In this story he represents constituted authority , or authority imposed from without and accepted simply because it has always obtained , and it is not until that force has been overthrown that the mind is free to take a truly impartial view of the conflicting factions and thus to allow the lovers to fulfil their destiny of reconciliation without interference . To accept an ethical system , or any system of values , uncritically and without question is to deliver oneself into the power of John Blandish , and that implies the adoption of a prejudiced and intolerant attitude towards Ma and her faction . If authority is thus vested in any one-sided system which fails to take due account of inherent tendencies in the mind of a nature which happens to be uncongenial to it , then the authority principle ( the Great Adult ) will be split into light and dark halves and will manifest itself through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superordinated or dominant nature by compelling the subject against his will to adopt types of behaviour which are directly opposed to the dictates of the light half , and he will fall into the unpleasant and dangerous situation of being in conflict with himself . The further implications of this complex matter must be left until later ; we may anticipate here , however , by stating that emancipation from this condition of servitude is symbolized by the weakening of the authority and finally the death of the father and mother figures . We shall meet with examples of this in works to be considered later ; in Sanctuary and No Orchids , however , we find both figures still in their prime . THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTIONS The principle of the Opposites , which shows the manifold nature of the phenomenal world as deriving from the division of an ultimate unitary essence ( TO ( I : ' rrtpos , the Indeterminate or Infinite ) into contrasting pairs or opposites was first introduced into Greek philosophy by Anaximander around 600 B.C. although its appearance in oriental thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbolize fundamental mental patterns and will be found reappearing in various forms and contexts throughout the history of thought . A striking example of such a reincarnation ' of an idea is to be found in the modern scientific principle of equal and opposite reactions . When we fire a rifle the bullet is projected in one direction with a certain momentum , and in consequence the rifle recoils with an equal momentum in the opposite direction ; when we concentrate an electrical charge in one plate of a condenser an equal and opposite charge is automatically induced in the opposite plate . Precisely the same law applies to mental life : whenever we make a conscious effort in one direction a precisely equal reaction is produced in the unconscious in the opposite direction . The harder we try to be good the more insistently does the devil tempt us ; the more we force ourselves to be gay the gloomier grows the background of our thoughts ; if we compel ourselves to be hard-headed and tough in the world , we develop an indulgent sentimentality in our private lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unscrupu-  | lous financier whose mistress or daughter can twist him round her finger are well-known figures ; so also is the high-minded philanthropist with the unedifying private life . If our conscious attitude is too one-sidedly based on principles of Christian love and forbearance we shall provoke an unconscious reaction in the form of unadmitted impulses of hatred and vindictiveness and shall begin to persecute and oppress , or at best to call down the wrath of Heaven on the heads of those of whom we disapprove . This melancholy frustration of our best intentions is not only occasioned by excessive devotion to principles consciously chosen ; it can also be brought about by the intolerance of that attitude of consciousness of which we are not conscious because it is itself the censor and selective filter which controls the contents of the conscious mind . The functioning of this selective mechanism constitutes in itself an act of dichotomy , a violation of the primal indeterminate unity which calls forth its equal and opposite reaction . An explanation of the peculiar savagery of Ma and her minions may be sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction to an excessively civilized outlook , based on the principles of reasonable restraint , forbearance and the absolute and unconditional rejection of violence in all its forms . Such an outlook , while it may or may not be characteristic of this author 's personal attitude , is evidently typical of our international life , with the notorious contradiction which it displays between its professed aims of pacific collaboration and its overmastering proclivity towards quarrelsomeness , persecution and violence . No Orchids , in its sure intuitive correspondence with Archetypal situations , is a portrayal of the mind of our times ; its author , in grappling with his personal problems , whatever they may have been , has risen above them and presented us with a picture and a diagnosis of the ills of our whole civilization . It tells us that our conscious aims have reached a state of inflation which has cut them adrift from the roots of our humanity , and that the resistances which we have thereby provoked are ineluctably undermining and frustrating our misdirected efforts towards the conquest of the material universe and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with this matter in later  | chapters ; for the present we may note that violence begets violence and the orderly and disciplined world of John Blandish is compelled to defend the position which it has usurped , by the employment of henchmen like Fenner and the police , whose methods are hardly superior to those of their opponents . It is immaterial who started it ' : all that matters is that hatred reigns and has given rise to a conflict which in its bitterness descends to the employment of progressively ever more ferocious methods . I do not speak of outer-world movements , of the battle between the Haves and the Have-Nots , the Capitalists and the Workers or between any opposing movements or political systems . It is immaterial , as we shall see later , on whom the image of the Adversary is projected . Humanity can be , and has been , divided and brought to bitter strife on the basis of distinctions between religious confessions , racial cultures , and national policies , no less than on that between political and economic ideologies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another 's throats and degrade them to a level lower than that of simple , unadorned barbarism is that the natural impulses towards hatred and fear should be canalized , concentrated and projected on to an arbitrarily chosen figure , be it that of international Jewry , Communism , the coloured races or religious dissidents . War and persecution are psychological phenomena and we have to seek their roots in the study of the mind , not in that of material conditions . If another man is richer and more privileged than I am I may accept the relative position as being justified , or I may set out to equalize it by methods which we both accept as permissible ; in either case I may legitimately envy and dislike him , but that is quite a different matter from giving rein to a savage hatred which impels me not only to hang him from a lamp-post , but to cut the throats of his wife and children as well . The difference is obviously purely a psychological one . THE REDEMPTION OF SLIM In no character is the functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in that of Slim . Fundamentally , as we have seen , he fills the role of Prince Charming ,  | the princess 's fore-ordained lover , yet he is portrayed as a loathsome monster of ferocity and unnatural viciousness . That , in the first place , is because he is contaminated by his underworld origins ; but in his case there is an additional factor , and that is the reaction which he represents against the element of purity imposed on the Blonde in order to create the figure of Miss Blandish . The traditional fairy-tale prince and princess ? Florizel and Perdita , for instance ? are quite simply and naturally virginal and chaste because they are no more than the embodiments of the organs which their respective factions have , so to speak , developed for the purpose of reunification in love : they are the Lovers and nothing more . But into the figure of Miss Blandish there enters an additional element which complicates the situation : she had all that the other girls had but she had a lot more , for she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Blonde , and her purity is therefore something positive , something arbitrarily imposed . Just as the selective concentration of erotic charms in the figure of the Blonde herself produced its equal and opposite reaction in the repellent characteristics of Ma , so does the selective imposition of purity on to the figure of Miss Blandish produce its equal and opposite reaction in the viciousness of Slim , who is unequivocally portrayed as a sadistic pervert . This hypothesis is substantiated by the fact that the Blonde , in her original unimproved form , also has a partner , but he is far less repellent than Slim . This is Eddie , the gay philanderer of the Grisson mob . He never commits any atrocities  --  he does not even kill anybody in the course of the story ? and for a gangster he is really quite an acceptable person . I think that he represents the Blonde 's partner in the process of her rehabilitation , and this is probably why he is the only gangster to survive the story . He suffers for his membership of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the police , but he is allowed to survive because the process of the Blonde 's rehabilitation is not yet complete . The major venture , Miss Blandish 's attempt at a total reconciliation , failed , and she was lost as Eurydice was lost ; but the more modest enterprise of the Blonde 's rehabilitation has shown some solid gains by the time the story reaches its tragic end . The psychological process whereby the underworld lover has  | to take upon himself the vices corresponding to Miss Blandish 's virtues had already taken place in the creation of Faulkner 's Pop-Eye who , we know , evidently served as the inspiration for Slim . It is therefore interesting to note in what respects Slim 's picture and development differ from those of his prototype . Pop-Eye was irremediably impotent , yet his impotence did not prevent his debauching and degrading , by indirect means , the unfortunate girl who had aroused his lust . The meaning of the parable is evident : it is that the image of the pure princess can be besmirched and degraded by impure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it finds expression in normal sexual activity , for it is incomplete , lacking the true essence of virility , which is to vitalize and fructify . It is no more than what James Joyce , in Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man , describes as cold lust ' . Slim begins by following his model faithfully : he too is a sadistic killer , and whereas Pop-Eye is armed with a pistol he , more ferocious , has a knife . His impotence , however , is not irremediable , his reason for never having had anything to do with girls being only that he was afraid they might laugh at him ' . Miss Blandish , by inspiring his passions , gave him not only his physical virility but his manhood also , for it was in defence of her that he first dared to defy his terrible mother . He , moreover , indubitably inspired an answering passion in her . Chase , true to his model , depicts this love in a revolting form , yet he can not prevent elements of devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect Miss Blandish from his mother , but in the end , when destiny is closing in on him , he does not seek to save his own skin in solitary flight : he takes Miss Blandish with him . That makes death inevitable , but he will not give her up . Miss Blandish 's task in the underworld thus becomes clear : in order to achieve the reconciliation which is the main purpose of her mission she has first to redeem Slim , her fore-ordained princely lover , who has been degraded by his environment and brutalized by the reaction from the very virtues which she herself has assumed . Here we find another familiar fairy-tale theme : that of Beauty and the Beast . It is to be found in a number of forms in the Germanic folk-tales , in which the lover appears in a variety of ignoble shapes , such as that of a frog ,  | from which he is released by the love and devotion of the princess ; in order to demonstrate the universal nature of the theme it is worth mentioning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we find the enchanted lover in the forms of dog , ape and even he-goat . In one of them , which reveals similarities to the Lohengrin myth , to be discussed later , he is even confined in an underground cavern into which the princess must descend in search of him . THE RIVAL In dealing with the images in which the Archetypes express themselves in consciousness we have to beware above all of the besetting danger of facile identifications . The inner world is quite unlike the outer in that it is not inhabited by identities strictly circumscribed and separated from their environment and from other identities by a physical envelope , as appears to be the case in the outer world . I say appears ' advisedly , for the more closely we study the outer world the less definite and strictly circumscribed do we find these identities to be : the human body , for instance , is made up of individual cells , each of which has its independent existence and life-history , and some of which , such as the phagocytes , behave almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are the cells separate identities or merely parts of the whole ? And what becomes of the undoubted identity of a drop of water when it falls into the sea ? The question of identity , with which we shall be concerned more closely in later chapters , is a difficult one , even in the material world ; in the world of the mind it is infinitely more complex . Having identified a mental tendency , therefore , and discovered its identity with some typical fantasyfigure , we must be cautious about assuming without further consideration that the latter derives solely and exclusively from the former , for the image may well be a composite one in which two or more heterogeneous elements are confused and combined . Striking examples of such figures are those of the father and mother which we have identified in John Blandish and Ma Grisson , the composite nature of which has already been discussed . Another case is to be recognized in Slim . We have already identified the Prince or Lover element in his  | composition and noted how it tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from another source , so that Slim , under the beneficent influence of Miss Blandish , begins to acquire the rudiments of the nature of the Lover . The repellent exterior we have derived from the equal and opposite reaction to the purity imposed on the Blonde in order to form Miss Blandish , and to the rectitude and propriety of the upper-world system . There remains , however , one element , symbolized by his knife , his sadism and the general feral quality of his nature , which has still to be accounted for . Its explanation , I believe , is to be found in another Archetypal figure , namely that of the Armed Rival . In discussing the mating pattern we identified one element to which we have devoted no further attention : that is the masculine impulsion to drive away rivals . There can be no question whatever that this element exists in the human species , for it is universally recognized that men become pugnacious and cantankerous when their sexual interest is aroused . Since the same tendency exists in animals it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses a special neuro-sensory mechanism for recognizing members of his own sex exactly as he has one for recognizing his mate . Normally this image is only activated in conjunction with other elements of the mating pattern of which it forms an integral part : in other words it is associated with the image of the mate . Obviously in a gregarious species it would be disastrous if all males invariably attacked one another on sight : the predominant impulse in normal circumstances must be one of trust , friendliness and attraction in order to hold the herd together . It may therefore safely be assumed that the image of the male 's own sex receives its hostile and menacing colouration only when that of the opposite sex as such has been activated . The two form a pair , closely associated and imbued with opposite emotional tones . Now we have seen that the image of the mate may be activated and appear in consciousness in the absence of the appropriate external stimulus , and in the circumstances we are justified in expecting that when this happens her appearance might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the guise of a hostile and menacing rival . This we find in fact to be the case . The figure in question I have called the Armed Rival , for  | he is almost invariably equipped with some weapon , and the hero is compelled to do battle with him . The Rival 's weapon plays a double symbolical role : in the first place it represents his hostility and dangerousness , and in the second it symbolizes his sexuality . Weapon ' is a familiar colloquialism for the penis in more than one language , and it has been demonstrated that weapons , and particularly weapons which shoot , such as the pistol and the bow , frequently represent the physical element of virility in dreams . The Rival , in fact , is man in his sexual aspect , not simply man as a fellow-member of the species . We shall meet the Armed Rival in a number of exemplars as this study progresses , and I shall therefore postpone a more detailed consideration of his attributes and trends of development ; for the present one classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother Valentin , with whom Faust is compelled to fight a duel . The relationship of brother to the mate image which , beside the more obvious one of wronged husband , the Rival habitually favours , will also be explained in its place . Another very striking example is worth quoting at this point : it occurs in a film , Les Belles de Nuit , directed by Rene Clair , which appeared in the early 1950 's . The plot is briefly as follows . A poor young teacher of music has a series of dreams in which he is involved , in turn , in fantastic romances with all the pretty women with whom his profession and his daily life bring him into contact . There is a theme-song to the words I shall be thine , but only at night ' . But in each adventure his love-making is interrupted by the Armed Rival : husbands , fathers , brothers , equipped with every kind of weapon , make their appearance , and the dreams culminate in a nightmare flight from a crowd of pursuers threatening him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gigantic pair of scissors . These last , incidentally , are first produced when he is trapped in an oriental harem , and are introduced with the sinister intimation that the outraged brothers of the lady intend to keep a souvenir of the dreamer 's visit . When he attempts to defend himself with a sword the great scissors snap it off at the hilt , which is an evident allusion to the symbolic penalty for trifling with the Blonde . It is worth noting that the Rival has his counterpart in the  | feminine psychology , but needless to say she is not armed . She may appear as a seductress , but more commonly she is portrayed as an insensitive , practical , managing type of woman who ensnares the heroine 's true love into matrimony . She makes him a good wife ' from the worldly point of view but is seen as destroying his soul ; the latter , needless to say , is truly understood by the heroine alone . Examples are to be found in the Rebecca in Daphne du Maurier 's novel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Constant Nymph . This element in the mating pattern , however , has almost certainly less force at the instinctual level in woman than in man ; the feminine Rival , therefore , plays no such important role as her masculine counterpart . Returning to the male pattern it is easy to see that this particular element may be unacceptable to the typical civilized conscious attitude , which deprecates all forms of violence and enjoins courtesy and brotherly love in all circumstances . The highly civilized man , although he may welcome and approve of the impulse which he discerns in himself to seek and win a mate , is apt to look with distaste on the concomitant desire to commit physical violence on other males , for which purpose he may , in any case , be ill suited by temperament , physical endowment and training . If he is of a retiring and self-conscious disposition he may even deprecate any tendencies which he discerns in himself to clear the field of rivals by means of an assertive and masterful demeanour ; he considers such behaviour in bad taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by reason of the critical attitude of his conscious mind , which insists on pointing out to him that it is not objectively justified , he lacks the confidence to carry it off . If he attempts to do so he is apt to collapse in a humiliating manner and becomes obsessed , like Slim , with the fear that girls will laugh at him . He therefore finds the aggressive side of the mating pattern unwelcome and attempts to suppress and ignore it . IIe can not , however , get rid of it because it is rooted in an innate mental pattern , and the attempt to ban it from consciousness merely results in its building up in the unconscious , where it takes the form of archaic urges towards the most primitive forms of violence . The distinction between subject and object and that between self and not-self is by no means clear in the unconscious ,  | and impulses which ought properly to be realized by the action of the subject may very easily be interpreted , in fantasy , as influences acting on him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , they really are , since his instinctual disposition is external to his conscious mind . Hence the figure of the Armed Rival represents not only the danger inherent in the mating pattern of possible attacks from outer , objective , rivals , but also the danger which the subject feels as emanating from an uncongenial aspect of his own sexuality . This may manifest itself in the form of alarming and distasteful archaic representations of violence which are none the less filled with an unholy fascination . This image is clearly one of the principal ingredients in the figure of Slim . In the conventional love-story , such as that which we have seen in the tale of Prince Diamond , and of which we shall meet with further examples later , the Rival appears as an evil and inferior opponent whom the Lover must overcome , but in Slim the two roles are merged and combined . In the former case the union of the lovers is regarded as an ideal possibility which can take place in all chastity and purity once the impediments represented by undesirable archaic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indeed seen as an integral and indispensable part of the pattern . The difference between this view and that found in Sanctuary and No Orchids can be attributed to a fact to which attention has already been drawn , namely that the conscious mind of the narrator has taken sides with one of the opposing factions , which it sees as superior to the other . This leads to the stigmatization of one of the pair of lovers as inferior and unworthy , and hence to the denial of the possibility of an ideal union . What is far worse , it leads to conscious interference with the natural process of reunification which , if left to itself , would follow its own proper course . Slim , therefore , like Ma , is a composite figure made up of heterogeneous elements . The appearance of such a figure in consciousness implies that mental contents of a disparate nature have been left to languish too long in the unconscious and are in need of raising to the conscious level where their ingredients can be analysed and separated . Until this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards any aspect of  | life in which the complex in question is concerned , because the mixed projections which it engenders provoke incompatible and often mutually contradictory reactions . The process of mental development , therefore , and the progressive adaptation to a growing field of conscious experience which it implies , may be seen in terms of a continual raising of such composite figures to consciousness and of their analysis into their separate constituents . Such an analysis , of course , does not consist of a merely intellectual process but of an actual sorting out of the impulses , feelings , etc. in question in terms of life ; this process constitutes one of the principal themes of this study . THE ANIMA In Miss Blandish herself we have a representation of an Archetypal figure which Jung has identified and named Anima . The Latin word , of course , originally meant breath ' , hence life ' , and finally acquired the meaning of the animating ' or lifegiving principle , a concept which is commonly called soul ' . But ancient philosophy generally regarded man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . The body it recognized as being like in nature to the inanimate substance , the earth ' , dust ' or clay ' into which it decomposes when it loses the anima or breath of life . The best known formulation of this doctrine is the passage from the second version of the Creation myth in Genesis quoted above , which , in the Vulgate , reads as follows : Formavit igitur Dominus Deus hominem de limo terrae , et inspiravit in faciem ejus spiraculum vitae , et factus est homo in animam viventem . God takes the clay , breathes life into it , and man becomes a living soul ' ( anima ) . From this passage it is apparent that the soul , which man actually is ' , results from the impregnation of the lifeless clay by the life-giving breath of God ; the breath ' here is not the anima but something else : it is the impersonal , divine essence commonly called spirit ' , a word which is of course also derived from another name for breath ' . Spirit was thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , variously conceived , but never regarded as personal , which it could not  | be because of its formlessness and universality . Both the two elements which went to the making of man , therefore , were impersonal : universal earth and universal spirit ; between these two the soul was a connective medium which , on the one hand , held or contained the formless universality of spirit , thereby enabling it to manifest itself in a particular form , and on the other animated ' lifeless matter , transforming it into a living , individual body . Soul was therefore at the same time personal , when seen as the particular soul inhabiting a particular body , and universal , when seen as the world-soul or vessel of the spirit . It is only in more recent times that the dichotomy between spirit , or mind ' , and matter ' in the modern scientific sense , has been developed . Until about two centuries ago no precise dividing line between the two was recognized , the difference being regarded rather as one of degree . Spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now call matter only in the degree in which they possessed an attribute described as subtlety ' . According to the modern way of looking at things , on the other hand , everything is either matter or not-matter ; spirit and soul , therefore , fall together into one group , standing in contrast to its opposite , which includes the body as matter . The Church almost seems to have anticipated this development , for it has long ago reduced the ingredients of human nature to two : soul and body . Spirit has apparently disappeared as a separate constituent , being seen as a Divine Substance external to man , and in which he has no part . The various theological dogmas concerned represent a complicated subject on which I am not qualified to speak , but the ordinary current beliefs in this matter are certainly that man consists of an immortal soul inhabiting a material body , and that there is no third element in his composition . But such beliefs as that of the threefold nature of man are precisely of the type to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been held for a long time and by many people and it is certain that they are no mere idle speculations , but represent some inner-world reality . In confirmation of this it may be mentioned that Berdyaev , l himself a mystical Christian , comments on the regrettable fact that the concept of a spiritual ingredient in human nature has disappeared , Footnote  | leaving us with the confused notion of a soul which embraces the whole non-material nature of man . There exists , in short , a definite need for a fresh analysis of man 's mental or inner nature which takes account of the fact , long recognized , that it contains two separate and contrasting elements , once distinguished as spirit ' and soul ' . Jung has made a beginning in this formidable task by his identification of the Archetypal figure of the Anima . This figure , like most of his discoveries , was not the outcome of theoretical speculation in vacuo , but of the empirical observation of his material , consisting of the fantasy-products of his patients , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Anima has virtually no connection with the current conception of soul ' described above : she is a psychological fact , an image in feminine form which he has identified in the masculine psyche and which does actually constitute a kind of mediating link between the two worlds of the personal mind and of the universal Archetypes : this , evidently , is why we have found her guarding , and personifying , the door through the Barrier . He has named her the Anima for this reason , for she is both the personal soul and the world-soul , and thus preeminently the bridge over which we may pass into the Other Side . The Greek word psyche , which means literally butterfly ' and has come to mean something similar to soul ( providing , of course , the root of such words as psychosis and psychology ) he uses in a sense almost exactly equivalent to the English word mind ' , for which there is no exact equivalent in German : it embraces the whole mental , spiritual and psychic ' nature of man ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German seelisch , the adjectival form of Seek , the soul ) both conscious and unconscious ; it includes the typical contents and patterns of the mind and has a dynamic as well as a static aspect . The Psyche , as the word is used by Jung , is a world in itself and corresponds approximately ( but only approximately ) to what I have described as the inner world . The Anima is one of the Archetypal contents of the Psyche , and as such a living , objective reality with her own characteristic tendencies , which become manifest not only in the images of fantasy but in actual human behaviour .  | Jung , taking the existence of the Anima as an empirically established fact , explains it as deriving from three sources : ( a ) the actual relationships of the individual with women in his personal life ; ( b ) the natural feminine ' characteristics in every man , repressed and confined to the unconscious as a result of his conscious and unconscious striving to shape his character and behaviour in accordance with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothetical mental heritage from man 's experience of woman in all her roles and aspects in the course of past generations . ' It will have become apparent from the foregoing that I would add to these sources the innate mate-image determined by the special neuro-sensory mechanism of the instinctive mating pattern . As to the element described in ( c ) above , I regard it as an accretion , embodied in the collective unconscious , in which all individual minds are contained and in which they participate at their more primitive levels , not ordinarily accessible to personal consciousness . It is at this level that such images as those of the Queen or Mother arc to be found . We have , moreover , already seen that variants of this image may be of a composite nature , and here we come up against one of those problems adumbrated in the introduction to this work : what , exactly , are we to define as the identity in question ? Ma Grisson , Miss Blandish and the Blonde are all variants of a figure which falls under Jung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already established the fact that each of these contains ingredients which are absent in the others . We have , moreover , noted that each of them is liable to transform herself suddenly into one of the others , and additional evidence of the same phenomenon will shortly appear . We are therefore faced with the problem of deciding whether to place the emphasis on the common elements , thereby building up the picture of a single underlying identity , Anima ' , which exhibits different attributes when exercising different functions and when seen from different viewpoints , or , alternatively , emphasizing the diversity of elements and defining Anima ' as no more than the form resulting from a particular combination of these elements . As I stated in the Introduction the material Footnote  | available and the present development of the terminology and definitions of the science of the inner world are not as yet adequate to permit of a final decision being reached in this matter ; for the time being we must accept a considerable degree of uncertainty and imprecision . We shall be concerned with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later volumes , and perhaps it may be possible , after considering the additional material which will be adduced , to reach some more precise definition ; the reader , however , is warned that the study of the Anima , as of all the inner-world figures , will inevitably reveal much that is irrational and contradictory . This difficulty is inherent in the task of raising the contents of the unconscious , a region of the mind in which thought is still at what LcvyBruhh describes as the pre-logical ' stage , to the light of consciousness . It is worth mentioning at this point that according to the theory there should exist a corresponding male figure in the feminine Psyche , and this is found to be true in fact . Jung has called him the Animus , and in our study of Wuthering Heights ' we shall find him dominating the scene . THE FAILURE OF THE VENTURE The basic theme of No Orchids is the attempt to achieve the reconciliation of the irreconcilables by means of the age-old device of the Dynastic Union . For this purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine origin ( Persephone is represented by most mythographers as the daughter of Zeus ) is compelled to descend into the underworld in order to unite with , and if necessary to redeem , its ruler or heir . In the face of all opposition the union takes place , but only at the cost of unleashing a titanic conflict in which most of the contestants , and the lovers themselves , are annihilated . In this respect the story resembles that of the rape of Helen and the Trojan War . I have suggested that the cause of this failure lies in conscious interference , in that the conscious mind of the narrator can not restrain itself from siding with one of the parties in the conflict , or in other words from identifying itself with one of the opposing Footnote  | principles . Instead of encouraging all efforts directed towards the attainment of reconciliation , peace and harmony , which is the true desideratum , it views the prospect of any concessions to the underworld with such horror and misgiving that it secretly connives with the Blandish faction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . In order that the reconciliation may succeed it is necessary for the lovers to be left alone in trust and confidence to fulfil their inherent destiny . But to do this requires considerable courage and insight , and in this case they were inadequate . Insight is necessary in order to perceive that no reconciliation is possible for so long as Blandish upholds the harsh intolerance of his attitude , claiming the sole and exclusive right of defining good and evil ; courage is required to defy his authority , which is the authority not only of the universally accepted social code but also of those sacred principles and values on which the individual has built up his own personal code . Unless Blandish is held in check with both firmness and clarity of vision he will find means of frustrating the attempt to overthrow his tyranny . These means are personified in the detective Fenner . It has already been pointed out that he is a kind of offshoot of Blandish 's , sharing the latter 's rectitude and coercive respectability and adding to them a knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous region of the Other Side . Once he had been a journalist , that is to say an impartial observer and reporter of the doings of the underworld , and hence an invaluable function in the mind ; now he has sold himself to constituted authority . He is no longer impartial , and he treacherously exploits the knowledge and the connections which he had formerly acquired in order to subserve the cruel tyranny of Blandish . It is he who tracks down the lovers and is responsible for their destruction . The figure of Fenner is also a composite one . In his aspect of former reporter and penetrator of the Barrier he represents the mental function of intuition , which as we shall see later is the means whereby the contents of the unconscious are revealed to the conscious mind ; he is the faculty which enables the author to draw on his creative fantasy for the making of this story . In his invincible chastity , however , and in his inveterate hostility to the unfortunate lovers , he represents a far more  | powerful figure with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume : it is that of the Child-Hero . The beginning of the trouble lay in the escape of the princess . She is , to begin with , an empty-headed little thing who , like Persephone , is given to running around innocently plucking flowers in the neighbourhood of the gate to the underworld , without an idea of the existence of anything so dangerous . But on account of her exalted origin and her virginity she is the focus of great forces and the bearer of a great potentiality . Like Emma Bovary she has always had callow dreams of a great love , but she is innocent of any conception of the realities of lust and passion . And although she has no knowledge of the fact , her fore-ordained lover exists , and he is very close to her , namely just below her feet . The unalterable law of her nature , moreover , is that once she has seen him she will be his for ever . All this is only too well known to her father , and for this reason he generally keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in myths and fairy-tales are innumerable : the classical type is Danae , and several examples are to be found in the Arabian Nights and in Germanic folk-tales . But love always finds means of circumventing the father 's most careful precautions , for the drive to reunification is a necessity of spiritual survival and emanates with irresistible force from the Centre of the individuality . It is to this drive that the princess owes her very existence , and she is its principal instrument . The lover , therefore , succeeds in penetrating to the princess , or else she escapes and flees with him , and this is the first step on the road to reconciliation . In No Orchids the theme of escape is spread over two episodes : the visit to the night-club which leads to her abduction , and the flight with Slim at the end . In the latter case , although the stronghold from which she escapes is her underworld prison , it is with her lover that she flees , and it is from her father that she is escaping . But although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuality it represents a disaster for her father , the upholder of the established regime whose oppressive tyranny has brought about the conflict which his daughter was born to reconcile . He , therefore , remorselessly pursues the pair ( unless , as in some cases , his natural affection triumphs over his prejudices ) and in doing so he sometimes , as in No Orchids , makes use of another  | fanatical upholder of the ancien regime , the Child-Hero Fenner . We must postpone consideration of this figure until later . Sometimes we shall find him in notable opposition to the Father , for , like those of all Archetypes , his nature is full of inherent contradictions ; but when he allies himself with him the two make a very formidable combination which may easily succeed in frustrating the budding romance . This is clearly what happened in No Orchids . RENEWAL Since the Anima , by definition , embodies all that woman represents to man without exception , she must in particular combine in her single figure the four cardinal roles of mother , sister , mate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we shall have ample opportunity to consider its implications in a variety of situations during the further course of this study . At first sight this statement might appear a truism or a matter of merely academic interest . It is obvious that many women combine all these roles , but of course in outer-world fact they stand in each relationship to a different man ; we can , of course , also construct an abstract notion of woman ' which embraces all these mutually exclusive practical relationships in just the same way as we can form a notion of , say , state ' , which embraces mutually exclusive forms , such as those of absolute monarchy and democratic republic . But we are dealing with an inner-world , not an outer-world entity : the Anima is a pattern of the mind , and as such is perfectly capable of combining attributes which , in the outer world , are mutually exclusive . The importance of this consideration lies in the fact that if one of these attributes is touched upon or activated the others tend to present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collective unconscious ) involves those to the sister , mate and daughter images , and the same applies to each of the others . In the world of the mind there is no harm in this : the recognition and acceptance of the identity of the Anima , as soul , behind all these forms is , indeed , a necessary stage in the process of self-realization . Difficulties , however , arise when  | mixed projections are made on to individuals in the outer world : a man 's relationship to his wife , for instance , will obviously be falsified if elements proper to the relationship to the mother creep into it , his relations with his daughter will suffer if they are contaminated by elements belonging to the relationship with the mate and so forth . It is an obvious and well-known fact that such confusions constantly do take place , and that alone affords considerable support for the hypothesis of a single underlying image . The fourfold nature of the Anima is also constantly to be found in symbolical form : some random examples will illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gospels : their exact identity is a matter of some uncertainty , but the number four is associated with them with the same insistence as that of twelve is associated with the Apostles ; just as the Virgin , moreover , is essentially the mother , Mary Magdalene , as harlot , obviously plays the part of mate , and Mary and Martha are a combined type of sisterhood . Again , in Bernard Shaw 's Pygmalion Higgins and Pickering , on learning Liza 's name , declaim the following poem : Eliza , Elisabeth , Besty and Bess They went to the woods to get a bird 's nes ' : They found a nest with four eggs in it : They took one apiece , and left three in it . To this Liza retorts Oh , do n't be silly ' ? a very appropriate comment , since the interpolation has no purpose whatever . It is neither funny nor apposite , nor does it add anything whatever to the story , nor characterize the situation : it is completely pointless . The only explanation of its presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has crept in with Liza in exactly the same way as the image of water crept in with the Blonde : Liza is the Anima , and she is four-in-one . As I have already observed , the next thing which happens to her is a bath : the image of water has also crept in . Finally we may take Evelyn Waugh 's Put out More Flags , which is a story of the four women surrounding Basil Seal : his mother , his mistress , his sister and a young girl evacuee who is entrusted to his charge and thus stands in the relation of daughter to him . Of the four three are unequivocally stated  | to be in love with him and the fourth , his mother , is seen entirely in the light of her preoccupation with him : it is once again a picture of the fourfold relationship of woman to man , and it indicates the possibility of confusion between the various roles . The complete picture does not appear in No Orchids , but we have already seen how the image of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mate . Now , at the end of the book , we find the third element , that of motherhood , insistently presenting itself . When Slim has been killed and Fenner has rescued Miss Blandish he takes her to a hotel and conducts her to a reserved room . She walks to the window , where she stands looking out at the white clouds that piled up in the blue sky ' , and she tells Fenner that Slim is still with her ? that he always will be . Attention has already been drawn to the vividness with which the significant scenes in No Orchids are visualized ; a susceptibility to the beauties of nature , on the other hand , is not one of its characteristics . This image of the clouds , therefore , is all the more striking , and we are justified in looking for some symbolical significance in it . The clouds are piling up ' : the wind is penetrating their swelling forms . One is reminded of Titania 's to see the sails conceive And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fecundating power is an image as old as mankind ( it is animus , the counterpart of anima ) . Then Miss Blandish says that Slim is still with her and always will be . The inference that she is pregnant is inescapable , and it is perhaps worth mentioning that in my first draft of these chapters I drew attention to it . It was not until later that I had the gratification of finding my conclusion confirmed in a sequel , The Flesh of the Orchid , of which I had no knowledge at the time : it centres round Carol Blandish , Miss Blandish 's daughter by Slim , it being explained that Miss Blandish had survived her attempted suicide for long enough to give birth to this child . Orwell also , in the article referred to earlier , mentions parenthetically that there is another possible conclusion ' to the story , namely that Miss Blandish was pregnant ; but whether he too had interpreted the image of the clouds , or whether he had knowledge of the sequel we shall never know . The notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author 's mind when he brought his story to its dramatic  | close . To what extent it was conscious only he himself could say . We may conjecture that it had presented itself to him as a possible further development , only to be dismissed , mainly , perhaps , because his story had reached the requisite length and seemed to have arrived at its fitting and dramatically inevitable conclusion in the death of Miss Blandish , including that of any possible unborn child . But it is typical of the Archetypes , as we already know , that they take no account whatever of the decisions of the conscious mind . Anybody who has written fiction will know this : if a situation which has spontaneously presented itself is arbitrarily altered in such a way as to suppress any essential content , then the suppressed element will soon present itself again , either in the same or in some alternative symbolical form . It was Miss Blandish 's destiny to become a mother , and a mother she became . The attempted suppression of Miss Blandish 's motherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ venture was to bring about reconciliation through dynastic union , and the union is not complete until the heir is born . He , or she , is the heir to both worlds : it is only in the person of the heir that the irreconcilables can be truly reconciled , for this paradox can only become truth in the creation of a new individuality . In the sequel Carol Blandish , the daughter , is portrayed as half heroine , half maniac , and in this combination we may trace an additional reason , possibly more cogent than the mere desirability of bringing the story to a close , for the initial rejection of Miss Blandish 's motherhood . The conscious mind has taken sides : failing to understand that Miss Blandish had been drawn into the underworld in a mission of redemption and reconciliation , it insisted on regarding her abduction as a tragic disaster . Failing to perceive that Slim is Prince Charming transformed by enchantment into the Beast , it persists in portraying what was really an ideal of devoted love in the light of a foul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a union could be the Divine Child , born to inaugurate a new era of peace and concord : Slim 's child , on the contrary , is seen as inevitably tainted by her heredity . Another significant point is that the child is a daughter . We shall find later that this automatic and uninterrupted self-  | renewal is typical of the feminine principle known as the Anima . The situation with which No Orchids ends is precisely the same as that which divides Wuthering Heights into two halves , when the elder Catherine in dying reproduces herself in the younger . Mother and daughter are one , each for ever transforming herself into the other . It is the male , not the female principle that must pass through the maternal darkness on the way to self-renewal . It is therefore true that the venture failed . The story contains the statement of a problem and the suggestion of its potential solution , but that solution can not yet be realized on account of certain impediments in the mind . Therefore the cycle , having reached its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on to a new plane , simply recommences : Miss Blandish renews herself as the daughter of the virgin . If the problem had been solved the child would have been a son . ELEUSIS The mysteries of Eleusis played a very important part in later classical times . Thousands , from the Emperors downwards , yearly attended the ceremonies , in which they were initiated into some secret which , on the testimony of several reputable authorities , possessed a high spiritual content and served as an inspiration and a solace to many . Speculation concerning the nature of the secret imparted to the initiates has naturally been prolific , but no adequately authenticated evidence on the subject has ever been discovered . There are , however , grounds for supposing that the identity of Demeter and Persephone constituted one ingredient : an inscription has been discovered in which Demeter is celebrated as both mother and Kore , or maiden ) . One point , however , which deserves attention is that only in one rather unreliable reference to the Mysteries is there any reference to the birth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least of it , is surprising , since the pair are represented as living in wedlock for a part of every year . Only two inferences are possible : either the union is seen as inherently sterile , or else there is some mysterious reason for hushing up Footnote  | the birth of an heir . The former possibility receives some slight support from the detail , related in one version of the myth , that Persephone , who had gone out to pick flowers , was admiring a narcissus at the moment of her abduction . Sterility is of course inherent in narcissism , a theme with which we shall be concerned later . The alternative supposition , however , is suggested by a certain dark rumour which became current regarding the rape . Persephone , in some versions , is Zeus ' daughter ; Pluto or Hades is invariably his brother , the two having agreed to divide the sovereignty between them , Zeus ruling the upper , Hades the lower world . Hades , in other words , is Zeus ' other self ; his dark half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unconscious . ' With this couple , the Upper and the Lower God , we shall be concerned later , and shall find them appearing spontaneously in widely diversified contexts : they are , in fact , Archetypal images . Now a number of mythographers have suggested that there was some secret connivance between the brothers in the matter of the rape of Persephone , and this can only mean that it had become necessary for Zeus to seek union with his own daughter . This supposition is lent some colour by the fact that there exists another myth concerning one Klumenos who committed incest with his daughter Harpalyke ; concerning this legend Farnell2 states that it probably arose from a forgotten Hades cult contaminated with Orphic-Zagreus elements ' . The theme of incest between father and daughter seems therefore to have been associated with this complex , but it is important to realize that the vital point is not the incest , but the fact that the male principle seeks union with a female principle which it has itself engendered : the notion of incest as such arises only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer-world context . It was , of course , out of the question for even Zeus to carry out this scandalous project openly : he could not , indeed , even Footnote  | admit it to his own consciousness . In consequence he was compelled to carry it out , apparently by proxy , through the mediacy of his lower or unconscious counterpart . Yet in fact , without admitting the damaging identity to himself , he did ravish his own daughter , who thus became his wife . Supposing that there was issue of this union Zeus would be both the father and the maternal grandfather of the child : he would , in fact , be its male progenitor on both sides , making use , for the purpose of engendering it , of a female principle which he had himself produced . To put this situation in another way the Deity , having separated off the femine side of his own nature , proceeds to unite with it , thus procreating himself in renewed form . This theme of self-renewal or rebirth is one with which we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must postpone a more detailed consideration of it ; as we shall see later it is by no means incompatible with the theme of narcissism . In the light of the above it is a not completely unfounded conjecture that some intimation of this mysterious relationship may have formed part of the Eleusinian secret . Farnell discusses the possibility that the theme of a mystic birth ' may have formed part of the mysteries , a suggestion for which ancient authority exists ; while leaving the question open , however , he inclines to doubt the reliability of the evidence . Thus , while the matter is by no means proved it is not impossible that there may have been some suggestion that the Heir , the reconciler of two worlds , had been engendered and was born , or about to be born , in the hearts of men . The connection of this theme with that of the regeneration of the Deity will become apparent later in this study ; in the closing centuries of the classical era it was very much in the air . THE STORY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point we may once more have recourse to the remote world of the Arabian Nights for confirmation and reassurance . The story named above relates how Nur el-Din and Shams el-Din , sons of the old wazir , become , on his death , the joint wazirs of a certain sultan . In consequence of a trivial quarrel ,  | however , Nur el-Din goes away in a rage ; arriving in a distant kingdom he becomes wazir to its ruler and never returns to his home . This situation of the two brothers separating and each ruling his own territory shows an obvious parallel with that of Zeus and Pluto . The quarrel which causes the separation arises in the course of a discussion in which the two brothers agree that they should marry on the same day , that Nur el-Din 's wife should give birth to a son , Shams el-Din 's to a daughter , also on the same day , and that the pair should eventually marry . Here we already find the longing for reunion between the two sundered halves of the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consciousness of dichotomy : hence the antagonism between the opposites is intensified and the estrangement becomes complete . The project of reunification now crystallizes into the picture of the pair of predestined lovers . The events predicted duly come to pass , the two brothers , having married on the same day , being presented by their wives with a son and a daughter respectively , also on the same day , but of course without one another 's knowledge . When Shams el-Din 's daughter grows up , however , his sultan , enraged by the wazir 's refusal to grant him her hand in marriage , condemns her to marry a repulsive and ignoble hunchback . Nur el-Din has in the meanwhile died , and his son , Hasan Badr el-Din , has fallen into misfortune . An ifrit now takes a hand in the game , substituting young Hasan for the hunchback on the bridal night . At the wedding ceremonies the two men stand side by side , and later the ifrit removes the hunchback and stuffs him down the privy  --  a characteristically Arabian Nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Prince Charming . After the consummation of the predestined union the ifrit removes Hasan , whom he accidentally leaves in a remote spot , where he is compelled to remain . A son is born of this union , but of course nobody knows who the bridegroom was , and the latter , ignorant of the bride 's identity , has also no knowledge of the existence of his son . The boy is therefore brought up in the belief that Shams el-Din , his maternal grandfather , is his father . This is that same mysterious relationship to which I have drawn atten-  | tion in the case of Zeus and Persephone on the supposition that the latter had given birth to an heir , and the situation is evidently basically the same . Shams el-Din and Nur el-Din are two halves of the same identity who desire reunion but can not achieve it except by producing a mediating feminine principle . One half produces this principle and the other half unites with her , albeit under the polite veil of a rejuvenated version of himself , for Nur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his son . All the participants in this rather questionable procedure are ignorant of exactly what has happened , yet the underlying purpose is achieved in the birth of the reconciling principle in the person of the heir . The true situation is revealed in the explanation given to the boy that Shams el-Din is his father : the latter is thus seen as the husband of his own daughter and the procreator of his own rejuvenated self , or , more precisely , of the totality which had existed before his division into a pair of brothers . The name of the heir is AjIb , which means wonder or marvel : he is the Divine Child born to reconcile the estranged parties , and this he eventually succeeds in doing by discovering his lost father . Before being restored to his bride of one night , however , the latter , who had fallen to the low estate of a pastrycook , has to go through a process of regeneration or rebirth symbolized by his being shut up for long periods in a chest : here we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which necessitates passing through the maternal darkness . THE CHRISTIAN PARALLEL It is evident that this light-hearted and rather indecent little fantasy contains the essential elements of the birth story ' in the Footnote  | Christian legend . There are plenty of parallels for the theme of the mysterious and supernatural factors involved in the paternity of the Divine Child : the story of King Arthur 's origins , as related by Mallory , may serve as an example . The interesting point about the Arabian Nights parallel , however , is that it goes further , incorporating the question of the origins of the Divine Mother . This matter has been formulated by the Roman Catholic Church in the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary ; although this tenet was not promulgated until 187o and has never been accepted by the Protestant churches , it did no more than sanction a belief that had been widely held for centuries : it is , in fact , a psychological truth , and it clearly implies that the Mother of God is his daughter as well as his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legend , is , we saw , unequivocally revealed in the symbolism of the Islamic legend in the suggestion that Shams el-Din was the father of his daughter 's child . The parallelism substantiates the point raised in the Introduction , namely that if the Gospel stories are of universal psychological significance it is unlikely that they will be found to be unique , since the basic symbolical truths which they embody will almost certainly have been discovered by other people at other times and places as well . The recognition of this fact does not in the least detract from their value to an unprejudiced mind ; rather , on the contrary , it enhances it , since it demonstrates the universality of their content . Nevertheless the idea will come as a painful shock to many people , and the reason for this is twofold . First there is the unpleasant contrast between the two treatments of the theme : the cynical , lewd frivolity of the Arabic story on the one hand and the deep reverence associated with the Christian legend on the other . This is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does do violence to feeling values ; I am aware of this fact and regret it , but I am writing for likeminded people who are in search of psychological and intellectual truth and who insist on the right to state it as they see it without fear or favour . If , in the process , we wound the feelings Footnote  | of others not so minded we can only be sincerely sorry ; we can , however , comfort ourselves with the reflection that it has often happened before and that the devout , once having recovered from the shock , have succeeded in accommodating their beliefs to the new outlook without their suffering any real damage in the process . Darwin 's refutation of the Biblical legend of the Creation is an obvious case in point . To quote Jung : The man who simply believes and does not reflect always forgets that it is he who is continually exposed to the attacks of his own specific enemy , namely doubt ; for where faith rules doubt always lurks . To the man who reflects , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves him as the most valuable step to better understanding . People who are able to believer should be somewhat more patient with their fellows who are only capable of thinking . For faith anticipates thought by reaching in one bound the heights to which thought seeks painfully to climb . The believer should not project his own familiar enemy , ? doubt ? into the mind of the thinker , thereby attributing destructive motives to him . ' 2 The second cause for the revulsion experienced by many people against theories of this nature lies in the failure to discriminate between the differing natures of the two worlds , and the consequent tendency to interpret symbolism in terms of fact . The stories in question are purely symbolical : they are concerned with the renewal in the mind of a unitary principle of individuality which has become split into two conflicting halves or opposites by the excessive activity of the conscious mind . The conscious mind is itself incapable of bringing about this reunification because it is itself indissolubly identified with one of the pair of conflicting and irreconcilable opposites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Centre , the Self , God , or whatever we choose to call it , to step in . This Centre can only act on the conscious mind through the unconscious , and the unconscious disposes only of a symbolical mode of expression : it is simply incapable of thinking in Footnote  | abstract terms  --  - of dealing with such abstruse concepts as reunification ' , principle ' , factor ' , mind ' and so forth . It is therefore compelled to present its message in terms of parenthood , the fruitful union of the sexes , birth , death , and similar images which have held profound significance for humanity from time immemorial . It is the task of the intellect to accept these messages and interpret them in its own abstract terms , which are free of the emotional irrelevancies which cling to the archaic symbols . Virgin births simply do not occur in the outer world ; consequently the symbol is not associated for us with any strong emotional implications , and we can accept the story that one once occurred , very long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . It was a miracle : something manifestly impossible which nevertheless happened ? once and once only . Any attempt to prove that the story was not impossible in the outer-world sense at once destroys its value , for if it was possible according to the laws of the world we live in today , then it was not supernatural and it might happen again , and this time in trivial , everyday circumstances . Incestuous relationships , on the other hand , do sometimes occur in the world we live in , and they are regarded with horror ; the symbol , therefore , is associated in our minds with a powerful negative emotional reaction . We must , however , learn to free ourselves of this prejudice when we are considering what is purely symbolical ; we must remember that the incestuous relationships which form an ever-present background to the myths of all peoples in all ages have absolutely no connection with the sexual relations of individual men and women in the outer world : they are simply the expression , in archaic symbolism , of certain processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one male and one female principal there can be no question of incest , since these two must necessarily stand in every possible relationship to one another . The last thing we should do is to attempt to discover a factual basis for the symbols by asserting that they are generalized formulations of real ' incestuous impulses between actual , outer-world people : such thinking is not only embarrassing and repulsive , but reductive ' , regressive and misleading as well .  | VIRGIN AND MOTHER In all this some adumbration of the mysterious totality of the Anima is discernible . She is the mother who is celebrated as a virgin , the virgin who becomes a mother and whose virginity is perennially renewed . She is the daughter who becomes her father 's wife and mother , the indwelling feminine essence who is mother , wife , sister and daughter to the principle of identity in the mind . She is at the same time the dark origin of our individual being , the incentive and the goal of our striving , the fruit of our labours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have said , is no mere intellectual abstraction : it is a living force which is continually acting in the mind , presenting itself to consciousness at all times and in all places in images of the type which we have been considering . If any one of these partial representations is pursued to its origins on the Other Side , other aspects of the totality of the Anima will inevitably come to light . One such eventuality we have seen in No Orchids , where the pursuit of the Blonde ( the mate ) led to the discovery of Miss Blandish the daughter and Ma Grisson the mother . These discoveries are often perplexing and disquieting , not to say painful ; this is not only because of the repellent implications of such identities as those of mate and mother when transposed into outer-world terms , as the Freudians have transposed them , but because of the association of heterogeneous elements with some of the Anima 's forms . An example is to be found in the authority aspect of Ma Grisson which , in the classical Persephone myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lower God , who has no connection with motherhood . The Mother , it is true , must always be connected with the image of the Abyss , but not necessarily with any compulsive authority emanating from the darkness . This confusion was evidently one of the impediments which frustrated the attempt of Miss Blandish and Slim to achieve reconciliation and regeneration ; the other was the identification of Slim , the princely lover , with the menacing figures of the Rival and of another Archetype with whom we shall meet presently , namely the Shadow . Thus another potent reason for hurling Miss Blandish , the daughter , back into the depths rather than admit her  | motherhood was that to acknowledge it entailed acceptance of her identity with the repellent figure of Ma . This monstrous figure , like that of Slim , arises from false identifications of disparate elements in the unconscious : they form the basis of those troublesome phenomena colloquially known by Jung 's designation of complexes ' . The mental process of self-realization can not proceed to fruition until these images have been broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the first stage in disposing of them : the understanding thus achieved must then be lived out in the pattern of individual life . THE DESTINY OF PERSEPHONE We set out to answer three questions : who Persephone was , why she was carried off to the underworld , and why she was compelled to divide her life henceforth between the two worlds . With the help of No Orchids we are now in a position to offer tentative answers . Persephone is the Anima , the soul in the sense of the mediating principle between various pairs of opposites . The most important of these from our present point of view is the polarity particular ? universal : the mind of civilized man has become split into these two halves , seen as This World and the Other Side , and it is sometimes urgently necessary for him to restore the primal unity between them . If he fails to do so he is liable to be deprived of the Waters of Life , which are available only on the Other Side , and he becomes parched and exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide them he must pass through the Barrier , and it is the Anima who incites and enables him to do so . But the Anima , in her personal aspect , actually is the individual himself as he exists on the Other Side : when he passes through the Barrier he becomes identified with her . This matter of the mystical change of sex we must postpone for later consideration : all that we can say for the moment is that Persephone 's disappearance into the underworld represents the passage of the Barrier by the individual himself . One of the few things which we know with comparative certainty about the Eleusinian Mysteries is that the initiate carried out certain  | ritual acts in which he personified the goddess : even though he was a man , in fact , he was identified with her , and he regarded this identification as subsisting throughout his life . The Emperor Gallienus even had coins struck in commemoration of his initiation on which he is referred to as Galliena Augusta ' in allusion to this ideal It represented , in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his soul . Thus Persephone is in fact the type of every human individual in one of the most important aspects of his life . She shows the division between the two halves of the mind , and their fundamental identity ; her destiny of dividing her life between two worlds is the universal , inescapable destiny of humanity . The proportions of two thirds above and one third below into which the myth divides that life has surely less correspondence with the cycle of vegetation than with the traditional division of the day between sleeping and waking . We are always , throughout our lives , compelled to spend one third of our time in the darkness of unconsciousness : that is the most familiar form of the pattern , but the coming and going of Persephone is also concerned with a greater rhythm . The whole of life , as we shall see later , can also be divided into three periods , and Persephone 's descent into the underworld and her return are images of the transitions between them . The second descent represents the conclusion of personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final secret of the Eleusinian Mysteries concerned the promise of resurrection , for it is that promise , and that only , which can give solace to all , from Emperor to beggar . RECAPITULATION This concludes the analysis of No Orchids , and before turning to the wider significance of the main theme which we have discerned in it , it will be advisable to summarize the conclusions which we have reached up to this point . ( I ) The extraordinary popularity of No Orchids for Miss Blandish can not be adequately accounted for by its sensationalism or by any other superficial characteristic ; the story must therefore be regarded as a contemporary myth , the figure and Footnote  | destiny of Miss Blandish having become embedded in the collective mind in the same way as those of Sherlock Holmes , Alice , etc. , in modern times , or those of Hercules , King Arthur , etc. , in the past . ( 2 ) This acceptance of an image in the collective mind implies that it has fitted into and filled a place there : in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active in the unconscious mind , but for which the conscious mind has not yet found a rationally intelligible formulation . Thus it provides the generality of people with a form for the expression of something which they sense ' but can not express for themselves . ( 3 ) The basic forms which appear in such cases are the symbols of the Archetypes , which are the fundamental structures or patterns of the mind . They present themselves to consciousness in the form of characteristic symbols , consisting of typical figures , situations , etc. , and their typical activities or developments . Hence their behaviour appears autonomous , since the activities of the figures and the development of the situations are inherent in them and can not be arbitrarily changed . Any attempt to coerce them into a form incompatible with their inherent nature is a falsification of psychological truth exactly equivalent to a falsification of factual truth . Hence the creative ' artist or thinker does not really create ' his material  --  ex nihilo nihil fit ? for it exists already , and his task is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he succeeds in doing so he has produced a formulation which is universally valid , because he has found the solution of a problem which exists unconsciously in the collective mind of his time and therefore in every individual mind ; hence its universal appeal . ( q ) No Orchids is evidently such a successful formulation . It falls short of the criteria by which we adjudge a work a masterpiece , because its presentation is inferior and unacceptable from the aesthetic and ethical points of view ; but in respect of its symbolism  --  i.e. its presentation of the bare bones of psychological truth ? it must be rated more highly than many works which are superior in other respects . ( 5 ) If we analyse its plot in the light of these considerations we find the following outstanding features .  | ( a ) Its basic theme is of Two Worlds divided by a Barrier , ( b ) The dichotomy is seen in the following two characteristic forms : ( i ) The division between This World and the Other Side , or between fact and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular and universal . ( ii ) The conflict between two factions : on the one hand the upper world of constituted authority and rectitude , ruled and personified by John Blandish , on the other the underworld of the rebellious dispossessed and of vice and licentiousness , ruled and personified by Ma Grisson. ( 6 ) The division between This World and the Other Side is expressed by an awareness of unseen presences , who communicate symbolically by telephone from a Somewhere Else , or become visible in emerging out of the darkness of the night . Figures which have appeared in the light in this way may be banished when they become inconvenient , but they always reappear , although sometimes disguised ? usually thinly enough . ( 7 ) The separation between the Two Worlds leads to an impoverishment and devitalization of This World , and this to a longing to penetrate the Barrier in order to experience the richer life of the Other Side , and to recover some of the vitality , life-force or libido ( in the sense of that which confers value ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality , etc. , is seen as the Waters of Life , an age-old symbol for the life-force residing in the unconscious or generic part of the mind . Its absence is symbolized by the parched and exhausted conditions of This World , as revealed in the opening scene in Minny 's hash-house , or by the danger of dying of thirst , as in the Rime of the Ancient Mariner . ( c ) Water is associated with a female figure who , in No Orchids , is always found guarding the door through the Barrier ; in other legends she is found residing in the garden which it encloses . ' ( to ) Another form , in which the goal of the quest into the world beyond the Barrier is seen , is that of the Treasure , which Footnote  | is an object of supreme value . This treasure may be seen in the crude materialistic form of an object of pecuniary value , a piece of information conferring power , the rulership of a kingdom , etc. , and in this form it constitutes the nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme , however , the Treasure appears in human form , signifying that it represents the voluntary allegiance of a free agent . In No Orchids the Treasure is first seen as a diamond necklace but transforms itself into the person of Miss Blandish , who has a will of her own and insists on accomplishing her inherent destiny . In this transformation we may see a deeper penetration behind the Barrier , with a consequent raising of the standard of the symbolism , taking place as the story progresses . ( i i ) In the last resort the Treasure represents the capacity for free and independent decision residing in the individual . So long as this remains inaccessible in the unconscious the individual is not really free , but remains in the status of the Treasure in inanimate form , which is the helpless object of the contention of forces external to itself . This is because we can neither accept nor reject tendencies and impulses of which we are not conscious , i.e. which we do not see and understand as forces acting on us from within according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this we are either identified with them , seeing them as manifestations of our own individuality , or else we project them , seeing them as emanating from the outer world which is not subject to our volition . In consequence we can not will ' , and either relapse into a supine condition of dependence , or else are driven by forces which we can not control to commit actions which are contrary to our superior understanding . The nature of the forces in question , and the manner in which they act on us , are matters which remain for later investigation . ( 12 ) The only solution to this state of deadlock is to adventure into the dangerous world of the Other Side into which the Treasure has vanished , as the author of . IVo Orchids did when he wrote this story . This is the explanation of what we call creative activity . ( 13 ) The consequence of such a venture is that the discriminating light of consciousness is brought to bear on a number of mental contents which had hitherto been hidden in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the potential opposites contained in a latent state in them become apparent and fly apart , creating new conflicts and problems in the conscious mind . These have now to be dealt with , which is a difficult and dangerous process , entailing an adjustment of the conscious attitude to enable it to deal with the new and unaccustomed contents and problems . If it fails in this task the consequences may be serious , but with luck it is generally possible to break off the experiment temporarily , in time to avoid serious trouble . If , on the other hand , it is successful , a work of creative value will be produced , even if it is only in the form of an enrichment of the subject 's personality . In any case some of the life-force incarcerated in the unconscious will have been released , and the condition of devitalization will have been at least temporarily relieved . ( 14 ) This process is revealed in the state of war between the kingdoms of John Blandish and Ma Grisson which gradually pervades the scene as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paradise Club : this exhibits a parallelism with the legend of the rape of Helen and the Trojan War . At the beginning the conflict was only latent , but the resolve to pursue the Treasure brings it to actuality. ( 15 ) It is discovered that each of the rulers of the two irreconcilable factions has a child and heir , and these two fall in love and eventually consummate a forbidden union which ought to produce the heir to both worlds . This happy outcome is thwarted by the scruples of the author , who is prevented by a number of mental impediments from accepting it ; the venture is therefore temporarily abandoned , but the Archetypal symbols , undeterred , continue to force the outcome demanded by the inherent laws of their nature into consciousness ; the author therefore eventually writes a sequel in which the birth of the heir is admitted and her mixed inheritance unequivocally accepted . ( i 6 ) This theme of the Dynastic Union is familiar in the legendaries of many peoples in various epochs , and it illustrates the only possible solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Two Worlds . Neither can ever eliminate the other , since both are inherent parts of the mind ; the only possibility of progress therefore lies in reconciling thee , and  | this is symbolically achieved in the triumphant and fruitful union of the opposites which is represented by the union of the sexes and the resultant procreation of a new individual who combines the opposites in himself . Only thus can the selfperpetuating vicious circle be broken and a fresh start made . For this purpose the two factions present themselves in the form of the pair of idealized lovers through whom alone reconciliation and reunion is possible . ( 17 ) The theme is characterized by the care necessary in selecting the pair : this is usually symbolized by the arduous tests and ordeals which the male lover must successfully undergo , and the penalty for failure in which is death . The point , however , is not so much that he should prove his merit as his I ; 1 inherent right to the hand of the princess : the fairy-tales do not see the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hero is generally assisted by supernatural means which are anything but fair ' . The meaning is that the hidden agencies which are directing the play are insistent that he , and he alone , should win her . This theme is also illustrated in No Orchids in the fatality which befalls every man who comes too close to Miss Blandish , saving Slim alone , for whom she is reserved . No attempt to fob off on the Princess any lover acceptable by ordinary standards must be allowed to succeed , for the whole point of the undertaking is that she must be united to the one lover who is utterly unacceptable to her faction , namely the representative of their opponents . CO Romeo , Romeo ! Wherefore art thou Romeo ? ' ) ( 18 ) A successful outcome implies the termination of the rule of the Princess 's father , the king of the upper world ; knowing this , he therefore first attempts to preclude her foreordained love-affair altogether , by shutting her up , or by imposing , or allowing her to impose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these expedients fail , he remorselessly pursues the pair . This theme is embodied in No Orchids in Blandish 's pursuit and eventual destruction of his daughter and her lover through the agency of Fenner . ( I think my daughter is dead . . . I hope she is . . . I would rather ( these men ) were killed than arrested . ' ) ( 19 ) The meaning of this paternal opposition is that the existing conscious attitude , the one-sided intolerance of which  | has brought about the trouble , is not prepared to make any concessions to the innovations demanded by the attempt at reconciliation : it seeks to maintain its supremacy even at the price of sacrificing the only chance of regeneration . If the subject is unable to break his identification with his now outmoded conscious attitude he surreptitiously sides with Blandish and assists him to thwart the venture . This has evidently occurred in No Orchids , as in Sanctuary , which provided its inspiration ; the fact is revealed in the hostility displayed towards the male lover and in the ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be further removed from the idealized union of the fairy-tale prince and princess , such as Florizel and Perdita , yet the underlying theme is the same . ( 20 ) The means of attaining this end in No Orchids is the venial treachery of Fenner , once a free agent , who had obtained access to the underworld , but who now sells himself to Blandish and makes use of his privilege of entry to pursue and destroy the lovers where Blandish and the police , unaided , would have failed . The nature of this figure , and of the subtle and treacherous methods by which the conscious mind is prepared to thwart the projects of the unconscious , will be the subject of later investigation . ( 21 ) Turning to the female figure who guards the Barrier , we approached her from two different viewpoints , those of symbolism and of the scientific study of instinct . The former revealed that she may be identified with a figure which has haunted the minds of creative artists throughout history . She appears for preference as an incomplete female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is either concealed or is represented in non-human form . She seeks the love of men , and her purpose is to win a soul . In No Orchids she appears at the gateway through the Barrier , and it is evidently her function to lure men into the Other Side beyond it . If , however , they succumb to her charms and dally with her at the gate they achieve nothing ; in order to win the Treasure they must resist her blandishments and press on into the world beyond , as Fenner does . ( 22 ) The investigation of her instinctual background revealed that she is a development of an inherent image of the mind , namely that by which man recognizes his mate . Pursuing  | this line we concluded that she is a partial representation of a more generalized figure of wider import , which Jung has named the Anima , and which represents man 's soul ' : she symbolizes that side of his nature which has become lost to him through his concentration on his individual consciousness . In this capacity she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side , since she embodies those richer experiences of which he has deprived himself by concentrating on his conscious existence in this world and thereby delivering himself into the power of John Blandish , the intolerant and one-sided conscious attitude which condemns and rejects whole categories of experience to which he has an inalienable right . She is also the dispenser of the Waters of Life . ( 23 ) We noted that in No Orchids the Blonde displays a spontaneous tendency to widen and enrich her nature by developing characteristics of temperament and feeling which run counter to her apparent function as a mere wish-fulfilment ' or appeaser of lust . This tendency we traced to the fact that in her original form as the hash-house waitress or the anonymous blonde in black pyjamas she represents an incomplete and distorted version of the image of woman inherent in the mind of man . In this guise she is no more than a pin-up girl , or an exaggerated representation of the mate-recognition image to which male lechery has been artificially added . The elements of the total image which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the courtship stage of the mating pattern , and to the feeling elements demanded by the specifically human components of the relationship between the sexes . These latter are not solely contemporary conventions , but contain a large ingredient from the image of womanhood that has grown up in the course of the centuries of human history . This has become embodied in the collective system which shapes so much of our thoughts and values that no individual is free of it ; any attempt to ignore or defy it therefore produces a reaction in the unconscious mind . This reaction is expressed by the Blonde 's tendency to fill out her character by the acquisition of feeling values , and by the mermaid 's search for love . The essence of the matter is that in the guise of the Blonde she is incomplete , which means not only that the sexual life of those who see women in this light is defective ,  | but that they are not in possession of the totality of their souls . If they are to fulfil themselves they must seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling values is by no means solely a matter of sexual behaviour or standards : it reaches into every department of life , and the contemporary cult of the Blonde or pin-up girl is no more than a special symptom of the general tendency to neglect the feeling life in favour of the intellect . A further elucidation of this matter had to be postponed for the present . ( 25 ) Finally the Blonde , as the guardian of the gate through the Barrier , personifies that gate and all that lies beyond it , for it is in her figure that it first becomes apparent . The Other Side is the lost side of our nature ? the side that transcends personal limitations and the viewpoint bounded by the ego . It is to this that the Blonde beckons us in the challenge to undertake the quest of her full nature , which is the missing component of our own full nature . ( 26 ) The Anima has a variety of roles at her disposal and has favoured different ones at different periods of history . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blonde is that it has become vitally important that she should attract attention to herself . Her purpose in doing so is to persuade man to turn his attention to that which he has lost : sound feeling values ( which , for instance , include the ethical sense as opposed to intellectual principles and legalism ) and the suprapersonal , universal side of his nature . ( 27 ) The penetration of the Barrier and the refusal to dally with the Blonde which are symbolized in the early part of No Orchids do in fact lead to the discovery of both a completer form of the Anima and a superior apperception of the Treasure . Both are embodied in the person of Miss Blandish : as a virgin she is untouched and complete , and therefore potentially capable of filling all the Anima 's roles ( which the Blonde , as such , is not ) while as a human being she adds to the conception of the Treasure the element of freedom of decision . ( 28 ) It becomes apparent that her mission is to descend into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the suffering entailed , until she has redeemed her bewitched and degraded lover : she must transform the Beast into Prince  | Charming . When an attempt is made to restore her to the upper world before this mission is completed she resists vigorously . ( 29 ) A distinct parallelism is discernible between this story and the myth of Persephone , which formed the central theme of the Eleusinian Mysteries . The latter evidently contained a spiritual message of great importance , and their central theme appears to have been the identity of Demeter the mother and Kore , the maiden , known as Persephone the daughter . Behind this again lies a mysterious relationship between her and the father who is the husband of his own daughter and at the same time her son : the son is the Divine Child who is his own father ( I and my Father are one ' ) . ' ( 30 ) This latter theme has nothing to do with incest , but is a symbolical intimation of the totality of the Anima , who is at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle ( and of the Animus , who is father , brother , son and husband to the female principle ) . The male and the female , or creative and receptive principles , necessarily stand in every possible relationship to one another . The regeneration of the lost unitary principle in the mind takes place by means of a process of rebirth which involves union with the Anima or soul , who also stands in the relationships of mother , sister and daughter to that principle ; the process is represented symbolically in myths and legends which necessarily seem to imply incest , but that is only because of the archaic symbolism which is the only language at the disposal of the unconscious mind . ( 31 ) This matter of the multiple relationship of the Anima to man , and the incompatibility of her various roles with one another , finds its place in No Orchids in the development of Miss Blandish the virgin daughter into the mate and finally the mother . It was the last identification from which the author drew back in alarm , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Terrible Mother , which is another of the Anima 's roles ; the fundamental identity of the figure of Miss Blandish , with its almost divine implications , and this loathsome and frightening image , is one which is very hard to accept ? a fact which we shall find confirmed in the analysis of other works . Nevertheless its acceptance is unavoidable in the quest of the totality of the Anima 's nature . Footnote  | ( 32 ) One of the most characteristic and significant elements of the Persephone myth is Persephone 's participation in two worlds and the consequent necessity of her dividing her life between them . In this she typifies the human soul , which is both particular or individual , and universal or generic , and is compelled to live concurrently in these two contrasting and incompatible modes . These are the Two Worlds between which we are condemned to share our lives ; we can not afford to neglect either , and we must at all costs learn to distinguish between them . Their natures are irreconcilable , and it is our task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accomplished by participating in the destiny of Persephone . I have referred repeatedly to the Two Worlds but have only given vague indications of what they mean in terms of life . It has seemed preferable to begin with the symbolism of the theme , rather than with a reasoned disquisition , because the living symbol acts directly on the intuitive mind , engendering a sense of conviction in its own right . It is only those who set some store by intuitive perceptions who will be interested by a book of this nature ? I am convinced that anybody not so minded will have laid it down in disgust long before reaching this point ? so that nothing will be lost by appealing to the intuitive faculty first . At the same time it is advisable to seek confirmation of the conclusions of intuition in a more logical approach ; abstract statements , moreover , are apt to remain empty formulae unless their application to what we call real life ' is directly experienced . This consideration is in itself a differentiation between the two worlds , for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ' is the outer world . A theory is constructed in the inner world and applied in the outer , which explains why theory and practice do not always correspond ; each world is incomplete without the other , and a careful distinction must be made between the two . This particular distinction , however , does not exhaust the differentiation between them , which is a complex one , and difficult to formulate clearly . An attempt to do so must nevertheless be made , and it will form the Second Part of this volume .  | ONCE upon a time , I , Chuang Tzu , l dreamt that I was a butterfly , fluttering hither and thither , to all intents and purposes a butterfly . I was conscious only of following my fancies as a butterfly , and was unconscious of my individuality as a man . Suddenly I awakened , and there I lay , myself again . Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly , or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessarily a barrier . The transition is called metempsychosis.2 ( Chuang Tzu , translated by Herbert A. Giles . ) Footnote  | A FIGURE which has gripped the popular imagination in the same way as Miss Blandish 's did , taking its place in the second rank behind such leading personalities in contemporary mythology as Sherlock Holmes , Jekyll and Hyde , Alice , Tarzan and Peter Pan , is that of Thurber 's Walter Mitty . The pathetic , ineffectual , hen-pecked little man who is perpetually losing himself in dreams of glory is a figure of whom almost everybody has heard , even if he has not read the original sketch : Mitty , in fact , has been accepted as a formulation of something real in the collective mind . His function , I think , is much the same as that of the poignant figure created by Chaplin in his earlier films : he serves as a harmless , because wryly humorous , release for our self-pity . Self-pity is a dangerous weakness , which may easily degenerate into a victimization complex and a permanent grudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is repressed . In itself it is a natural reaction , for we try so hard , and the intentions of most of us are so good but we are for ever being frustrated and misunderstood by an obtuse , perverse and intractable world which goes its own way , refusing to accommodate itself to our good intentions . If we take the trouble to think about it we know perfectly well why this is so : it is because good intentions are not enough . It is necessary to learn in the hard school of practical experience how they can be made effective in a refractory world which was not made to our order . There is a danger , however , that we may not take the trouble to think about it : instead we build up a private system of self-justification based on the feelings of resentment and humiliation occasioned by our failures . As soon as we  | become aware of this tendency we are , to be sure , fore-armed : we can catch ourselves in the act of cherishing feelings of selfpity and resentment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unworthy , and dismiss them without more ado . But unfortunately this course , apparently so sensible and full of insight , represents the essence of that mental pattern which we have seen symbolized in Fenner 's subservience to Blandish , and the latter 's exploitation of the ex journalist 's right of entry to the underworld in order to frustrate the attempt at regeneration . The intuitive faculty ? Fenner provides the conscious mind with information concerning what is going on in the unconscious , but it is essential that that information be utilized in a tolerant and conciliatory spirit , and not perverted by the conscious attitude to subserve its own despotic repression of all that is uncongenial to it in the unconscious . If the subject 's situation evokes a feeling-reaction such as self-pity or resentment , then that feeling must be accepted and faced as a reality possessing its own inherent justification , irrespective of what view the conscious mind may take of it . If it appears unworthy and unsuitable to the circumstances it must , certainly , be prevented as far as possible from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it must on no account be brushed aside as unworthy of consideration . The latter course evokes in the subject even more unsuitable and unadmitted feelings , this time of superiority and self-righteousness , which will colour his attitude and affect his behaviour without his realizing it : his last state is therefore worse than his first . There is an anecdote of a man ? I think George Moore ? who had been unintentionally but culpably injured by another ; when the latter came to apologize , the victim , instead of concealing his resentment behind the conventional , and therefore expected mask of magnanimous forgivingness , greeted him with the words Go away ! I never want to see you again ! ' This reaction may appear and indeed it was ? pettish and selfindulgent ; yet if forgiveness did not spring spontaneously from the heart the outburst was in many respects better than a false and hypocritical pardon , which would have poisoned the relationship between the two men indefinitely , and left the injured party wallowing in unadmitted self-adulation . The childish outburst was , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once and for all , and was much fairer to the culprit . This trivial story illustrates , by the censorious criticism which it evokes in most people , how apt we are to judge our feelings according to principles , and therein lies a danger of disowning them , which may develop into an ingrained and vicious habit which distorts the whole personality . Feelings can not be reasoned out of existence : if we refuse them consideration , for whatever reason , however praiseworthy in itself , they descend into the unconscious , where they accumulate and fester . In the end they find means of evading the repression of the conscious attitude and of expressing themselves in ways which are far more objectionable , and generally more harmful , than a little spontaneous self-pity and resentment . Therefore we must learn to accept our self-pity and live it out , because we can not get rid of it in any other way . In this connection such figures as those of Mitty and the early Chaplin are helpful ( Don Quixote is another example , on a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the absurd , well-intentioned little man who is for ever being made a fool of in his attempts to bring a little kindliness , or some colour and excitement , into a hard-headed , tough , unsympathetic , humdrum world which is ruled by mean trivialities . Their function is cathartic , for they release feelings which most of us really entertain about ourselves but disown as unworthy . The essential point is that Mitty 's position is a universal human one , for even the toughest and most hard-headed individuals suffer in some way from this distressing paradox : we all live in two worlds and often have difficulty in reconciling the two . The only difference between individuals in this respect is that some arc more conscious of the fact than others . To put the matter in its most prosaic terms : things are not always as we should like them to be or think they ought to be , and we are faced with the problem of either changing the outer world to accord with our desires , or of adapting our requirements to it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not always as bad as we feared they might be , in which case we are thankful ; but in either case we are faced with the contrast between two conceptions : of things as they are and things as they might be .  | THE REAL WORLD ' For so long as we concern ourselves merely with concrete cases the problem seems simple and obvious enough : we live in a real ' world which exists independently of us , having its own characteristic nature and following its own inherent laws ; in our minds we imagine situations concerning which we believe , rightly or wrongly , that they exist , or could exist , in the real ' world . If we are right in our supposition , then the real ' world behaves as we expect it to behave when we apply our ideas to it , and we thus succeed in our purpose ; if , on the other hand , we were wrong , and the situation we have imagined does not exist , or is incapable of existing , in the real ' world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confronted . Our task , therefore , would seem to be simply to discover as much as we can about the real ' world and the laws according to which it operates ; once we have succeeded in understanding it fully we shall no longer make mistakes , because we shall no longer attempt things which are impossible , or at any rate unsuited to the circumstances of the moment . When we look a little deeper , however , we find that the position is not quite so simple . In the first place our thoughts and imaginings are by no means confined to the real ' world , for we are also interested , not only in abstractions which have only the remotest connection with it ( if they have any at all ) but also in situations in fiction , legend and fable which are frankly impossible in the context of the outer world and which we freely admit to be so . These matters undoubtedly have value for us , for humanity has always prized them , and there can be no question that they exercise at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , therefore , exist what we may describe as an inner world ? a world of thought and imagination which exists separately from the outer world which we call real ' , and is in many respects independent of it . APPARENT SUBJECTIVITY OF THE INNER WORLD At first we are apt to assume that this inner world is merely subjective ' : everybody , we think , has his own , which need have  | no connection with that of anybody else , whereas the outer world is the same for everybody . This assumption , however , is also open to question ; the matter will be elaborated as we proceed , but we have already adduced a considerable quantity of evidence which suggests that certain basic images such as that of Miss **25;1401;TOOLONG have a habit of appearing spontaneously in the minds of the most various individuals at the most diverse times and places ; when these Archetypal images appear , moreover , they tend to behave autonomously , in accordance with ascertainable laws which are in many respects equivalent to the laws governing the phenomena of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus appears that there is a definite objective element in the inner world , which is to some extent the same for all individuals in the same sense as the outer world is . THE SUBJECTIVE ELEMENT IN THE OUTER WORLD Turning now to the outer world , we are compelled to admit that although it appears to be completely objective , i.e. the same for everybody , this common element is confined to its basic principles , for each individual experience of it is essentially different from any other . Even if two people are looking at the same object at the same time they can not see exactly the same picture , if only because they are necessarily looking at it from points of view which are different , however slightly . Each , to be sure , normally constructs from his visual impression a mental picture of a three-dimensional object which he can imagine from any point of view , and thus , so long as the object is familiar and can be clearly seen , both observers will draw identical conclusions from what they see . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretations of sensory data which each observer makes on his own account , and it is easy to imagine cases in which their interpretations may differ materially . If , for instance , they are looking at an unfamiliar object from opposite sides they may come to very different conclusions regarding its three-dimensional form , and when we go on to consider their conclusions as to the nature , purpose and potentialities of the object , it is obvious that their conclusions may differ even more widely : the conclusions of a  | savage and a civilized man , for instance , may be imagined when they observe a television set in action . It is thus evident that the outer or real ' world exists very largely in the mind of the individual : he draws conclusions from his immediate sensory experience ? i.e. from the images on his retina , the vibrations of his ear-drums and the pressure on the skin of his fingers ? in accordance with pre-conceived images in his mind . In other words he recognizes what he sees , hears , feels , tastes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of which are built up from experience , but some of which , as we know , are innate ; he then interprets what he has recognized in accordance with his individual , subjective knowledge and understanding of the outer world , the objects it contains and their relationships with one another . It is on this complex and largely subjective basis that the conclusion regarding what he is experiencing rests , and this conclusion is probably the only part of the whole sequence which reaches consciousness . It may justifiably be objected that the outer world must be completely objective after all : astronomers , for instance , predict an eclipse years in advance , and at the due moment it is visible to every single observer in the predicted area , and in absolutely identical form ; the phenomenon , moreover , may be photographically recorded and the individual impressions of the observers confirmed by comparison with the picture . It is perfectly true that an absolutely objective element in our experience of the outer world may be determined if we take enough trouble to circumscribe it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only we took enough trouble and had enough understanding we might succeed in reducing the whole of outer existence to objective terms . Even scientists , however , are beginning to discover limits to this process ofobjectivization , within their own most special spheres.l The same consideration , moreover , undoubtedly applies to the inner world : we are already beginning to discern objective elements in it , and we have not as yet devoted to this sphere of experience one ten thousandth part of the attention that has been devoted to the outer world in the course of the last two centuries . Footnote  | EQUIVALENCE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SUBJECT TO INNER AND OUTER WORLDS If we accept the hypothesis that the individual does not independently create his thoughts and imaginings , but simply perceives what is presented from an inner ' source in exactly the same way as he perceives the data of the senses or outer ' source , it will become apparent that his relationship to the inner world is basically the same as his relationship to the outer : neither is inherently more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , any apparent disparity in these respects being almost certainly attributable solely to the difference in the amount of attention which has been directed in modern times to the two spheres . Thus if the subject bases his interpretation of his inner ' experience on the methods which he is accustomed to use in interpreting outer ' experience he will be just as certain to make mistakes and experience disappointments as he will if he does the reverse . THE TWO WORLDS AS MENTAL SYSTEMS OF INTERPRETATION There are thus sufficient grounds for assuming a priori that two alternative , contrasting , largely incompatible modes of experience are universal in the civilized mind , and that each individual builds up , on the basis of his experience of each of them , two separate bodies of knowledge , or systems of principles and values , which he uses to interpret his actual experiences . It is in these complex images , not in the immediate perceptions themselves , that his true experience of life , i.e. of meaning , is to be found . Thus , if he hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , but if it is in a familiar language he already possesses a complex mental image of sounds , words and syntax with which he can compare the sensory data from his ears : thus he hears ' not sound but meaning . Similarly , when a certain pattern is projected on to the retina of his eye he sees , not forms and colours , but , let us say , a chair or a human being ; l but that is only because he knows what these Footnote  | objects are and recognizes the essential features characteristic of the visual impression produced by them when seen from a variety of different viewpoints . When the viewpoint is unfamiliar ? e.g. a human being seen directly from above he may have difficulty in identifying the image . In the same way , once he has become familiar with , for instance , the characteristic impressions produced by the symbol which we have identified as the Anima , he will be able to identify it as it is presented from a number of different individual viewpoints ? in fiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is comparing a particular perception with a generalized image pre-existent in the mind . If all the images connected with , and derived from outer ' experience are brought together , classified , and arranged in a coherent , consistent and intelligible system , they constitute the subject 's individual picture of the outer world . But this , it is found , leaves a certain amount of material unprovided for : this is of an irrational symbolical , mystical , occult , coincidental and obscure nature . It is my contention that it is possible to arrange this material into a corresponding and opposed pattern Footnote  | of the inner world ' ; this can be just as coherent , consistent and intelligible as that of the outer world , although the system of classification and reference required to make it so differs widely from that which is appropriate for outer-world material . The reason why so few people nowadays make any serious attempt to do this is simply that the contemporary outlook is so strongly prejudiced in favour of the outer-world system that we take it for granted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fitted into our outer-world picture or , we believe , it can not be fitted into any intelligible picture at all . Consequently , when we meet with anomalous material we either do violence to its inherent inner-world nature by forcing it into the Procrustean bed of an outer-world ' system , or we attempt to explain it away as merely subjective ' , or in other words unreal . At this point I am begging the question of the possibility of two alternative and intrinsically opposed and incompatible methods of interpretation , each of which can produce a coherent and intelligible system . It is a hypothesis , and we have yet to discover to what extent it is capable of explaining the phenomena which we actually experience . These two systems , or complex images by the aid of which we interpret life are , if taken as wholes , of unimaginable intricacy and scope , and it is justifiable to call them worlds : they are , in fact , the only worlds we know , for our conceptions of any world or part of a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images inside ' them . Very often we do not realize that there are two of them : the outer world , we believe , is the only one which really ' exists : everything else in our minds is just nonsense , or fancy , or superstition , or psychology . But in fact , as will shortly become apparent , we do constantly discriminate between the two , and this implies the existence of an image of the inner world , however nebulous and incomplete it may be in comparison with our rich and highlydeveloped image of the outer . The contemporary mentality , in fact , is strongly prejudiced against the inner world in all but one respect ? that of rational thought ? which simply means that we are incapable of making sense of it , just as we are incapable of making sense of speech in an unknown tongue . This study is mainly concerned with the manner in which the awareness of this duality of experience works its way into  | consciousness , of how the images of the two worlds arc built up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are found to differ . THE MIND AND THE BRAIN We think that we know where the outer world is , and it is hardly necessary to warn the intelligent reader against the ingenuous assumption , common in more primitive thought , that the inner world is in another place , e.g. above the sky , or beyond the sea or the mountains ; it is , however , perhaps advisable to make it clear from the start that one is not inside our heads ' and the other outside . This is the basic misconception against which we have to fight , and the background and causation of which will become apparent as we progress . The contemporary picture of the world , which is accepted as self-evident by even the majority of leaders of thought , is that of a host of individual minds , often confused with brains , each confined within its own individual skull and all contained in a common outer world which exists in its own right , independently of them , and is the same for all of them . At least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it properly , for the sole function of these brains is to form a picture of the outer world , as revealed to them through the organs of sense , which shall correspond as closely as possible with its workings , again as revealed by the organs of sense . It is generally assumed , and often expressly stated , that the only things which the subject can know ' with certainty are those which have been revealed to his brain as a result of sensory experiences , and the sole purpose of knowledge or understanding is seen as the correlation of the sensory experiences of the past in such a way that those of the future can be predicted . The consequence of this attitude is that mind comes to be regarded as a mere function of the brain , and it is this misconception which gives rise to most of our difficulties . The brain is a physical object , situated at a precise point in time and space . It possesses extensions , in the form of the organs of sense , which provide it with information regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects , thereby defining that position and giving it a central or nuclear  | quality . The mind , on the other hand , although in its personal aspect it is linked to one brain or another , is by no means exclusively confined to any point in time and space . Time , space and material objects , including the brain and the sense-organs , are contained in the mind , not the mind in them . ( Time and space , of course , can not be perceived in themselves , but only as relationships between objects , states or situations . ) While personal consciousness is normally very largely determined or shaped by the precise position in time and space of the brain with which it is associated , it is perfectly capable of escaping from this bondage and turning , instead , to the other aspects of mind which are not so confined . This latter aspect of mind is commonly unconscious i.e. personal consciousness is averted from it ? but it is always available as an alternative mode of experience , and some individuals who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are even capable of making the transition ? passing through the Barrier at will . This matter will become clearer as we progress ; the contemporary prejudice against accepting mind as something separate from , and to some extent independent of the brain is , however , extremely hard to eradicate and can not be attacked too often . Let it then be repeated : the inner world is not confined within our heads , nor is the outer world confined outside them . Both are aspects of the mind . THE TWO WORLDS OF WALTER MITTY Yonder see the morning blink : The sun is up , and up must I , To wash and dress and eat and drink And look at things and talk and think And work , and God knows why . Oh often have I washed and dressed And what 's to show for all my pain ? Let me lie abed and rest : Ten thousand times I 've done my best And all 's to do again . ' Most people must have felt at some time or other the tragedy Footnote  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This World ? that misery immortally rendered in terms of the human body in Michelangelo 's figure of Dawn on the Medici tombs . She does n't seem to be very happy about it , ' somebody seeing a picture of this reluctant awakening for the first time once said to me . Indeed she does not ; but how many people have seen the point ? Reference has already been made , in connection with No Orchids , to the delights of the Other Side and the cheerlessness of This World when contrasted to it ; one more example of the expression of this feeling , taken this time from a highly reputable source , may complete the picture . Be not afeard : the isle is full of noises . Sounds and sweet airs , that give delight and hurt not Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears ; and sometimes voices , That , if I then had wak 'd after long sleep , Will make me sleep again : and then , in dreaming , The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd I cried to dream again . ' This inner world , which is in some respects so much pleasanter ( although in others so much less pleasant ) and nearly always so much more exciting , colourful and full of meaning than the outer , can not be simply dismissed as the expression of longings for pleasures which we have once enjoyed but lack at the moment in the outer world : it is no mere substitute for real ' experience but a complete alternative to it , existing in its own right . It is true , of course , that we are often led to turn to it as a refuge from an unsatisfactory outer life , but on the other hand it often forces itself on us , not infrequently in unpleasant forms , quite of its own accord . This , incidentally , is the difficulty with which Freud was confronted , and which he attempted to explain away ? in my view quite unsuccessfully ? in Beyond the Pleasure Principle . If we are open-minded we are compelled to admit that virtually everybody is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience in which things have a totally different significance from that which they have in the outer world , and in which they conform to totally different laws . They long to hear of arduous journeys to fantastic places , of catastrophic loves and even of extravagant torments , not because they have ever experienced anything even remotely resembling these situations in their personal lives , but simply because the stories have symbolical significance . They are enabled to experience the symbolical pattern in imagination , and the symbol , being a living force and no mere allegory , acts on the mind , relieving tensions and showing the way out of deadlocks . When , on rare occasions , such symbolical patterns do appear in their outer lives they experience them , of course , with even greater intensity ; but on such occasions the very intensity of the experience produces repercussions , in that part of the mind which is orientated towards outer experience , which are so powerful that they tend to be overwhelming . Hence such experiences are invariably disturbing , and are generally unpleasant rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to be lost , becoming overlaid by the multitude of practical repercussions which it engenders , and very few people who have gone through really dramatic experiences have any desire to repeat them ? although they will talk of them endlessly . An outstanding example of the overpowering and crushing effect of such coincidences of the two worlds will be seen when we come , in a later volume , to consider the case of T. E. Lawrence . It is only the tough and insensitive who are capable of enduring much symbolical content in their outer lives . Thus fantasies , and an interest in the inner world in general , are not to be regarded as morbid symptoms of maladjustment to the outer world : on the contrary , they are the signs of a very healthy adjustment to it . An understanding and objective interest in the fantastic , the dramatic and even the sensational are evidence that the subject is aware of mental needs which can not possibly be satisfied in his outer life without disrupting it completely : he therefore very wisely satisfies them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining himself as a responsible and productive agent in the outer world , and he knows that this task is a difficult one which can only be  | accomplished by a patient and persevering concentration on his outer life : there is no scope there for the volcanic and shattering manifestations of the spirit , which is the pure essence of the active power of the inner world . But such a concentration on the harsh and dreary necessities of the outer life leaves something in the mind uncatered for , and he experiences a craving for the wider horizons and the intenser , more dramatic life of the Other Side . If he is wise he will not dismiss this craving as a temptation to waste time and energy in escapism , but will offer it the expression and the scope it demands : when he finds waking unbearable and cries to dream again he will allow himself to dream ; or , if he lacks talent for it , he will participate in the dreams of the story-tellers . He must , however , beware of one mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify his outer-world personality with his inner-world experiences . The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is Thurber 's masterpiece , but its theme is by no means unique in his writings , many of which hinge on this contrast between fact and fancy . Generally Walter Mitty appears as the writer , who never tires of presenting the unworldly , unpractical , fantasy-ridden personality ( which , he implies , is his own ) in its humorously painful collisions with the prosaic outer world of machinery , policemen and domestic servants . Yet behind the wry self-depreciation may be discerned an insistence , sometimes gentle but at times almost arrogant , on the fundamental superiority of this incompetent and indecisive , yet poetic figure , which he makes himself out to be , over all the hard-headed and efficient persons who form his environment , and who think so highly of themselves . But he has also another vein , in which he mildly ridicules all that is pretentious , or that lacks a sense of proportion , or that horse-sense ' which spontaneously discriminates between the factual and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitty type and its justification in its own right is wholesome , for the contemporary world is inclined to accept extravert values too uncritically . Hard-headedness , efficiency and competence are its gods , and it is all too apt to overlook the fact that these virtues , valuable though they undoubtedly are , tend to crush and suppress the delicate growths of the mind . Life , the Tao  | Teh Ching ' says , is soft , tender and fragile ( like the bud ) ; it is death which is hard and tough ( like the seasoned timber ) . The success of a Thurber suggests that contemporary people are in need of some little comfort and reassurance in face of the harsh demands of the Blandish system . This unworldly trend in Thurber i at first sight hard to reconcile with the insistence on realistic common sense and sobriety of statement ? the tendency to debunk ' ? which we have also noted . If he insists on the value of fantasy and of the irrational over against the intransigently practical , utilitarian standpoint , then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concealed by his mild and almost apologetic tone ) such extravagances as Salvador Dali 's autobiography , and the theses of those purveyors of popular psychology who attribute road accidents to the idea that a motor-car is a sexual symbol ( ' because of the mechanical principle involved ' ) ? The answer is that he makes a fine distinction between two worlds : those of fancy and of fact . Probably he does not visualize the matter in these terms , yet his writings are a perpetual affirmation of his intuitive apperception of the truth that two worlds exist . Fantasy , he asserts , has value , however irrational it may be ? or , rather , precisely because of that irrationality . It is the enemy of the factual , down-to-earth , practical attitude which is perpetually trying to suppress it ; the man who is gifted with fantasy and who lives a part of his life in a world of imaginings is for ever at loggerheads with the outer world of facts and its ineluctable demands . He makes a fool of himself when faced with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car efficiently ) and is despised by his fellows and his wife , yet he feels superior to those who lack his gift , for he knows that his inner values are real . Yet at the same time those who possess the gift of changing the scene of consciousness from the outer to the inner world ? from the realm of fact to that of fancy must for ever be on their guard against the danger of overlooking and underrating the requirements of the former , and of distorting their Footnote  | perception of its true nature in accordance with the requirements of fantasy or theory . Thus Thurber insists that facts and the world of practical living have their own validity and obey their own laws , which are totally different from those obtaining in the world of fancy . These laws , and the pattern of this outer world , must be recognized and respected ; that is why he is moved to scornful attacks against those who impose their theories and their fantasies on to factual material in defiance of the totally different patterns of the factual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ever describing the absurd predicaments into which he , and those like him , are constantly falling when they come into contact with the intractable world of matter , and of human prejudices and presuppositions . Fact and fancy , he inferentially insists , must be kept strictly separate , for they are irreconcilable . Seeing himself in the unpleasant situation of living at the point of collision of these two powerful and irreconcilable forces he is a little sorry for himself and makes a determined effort to overcome his sufferings ( which , like those of all such people , are real enough ) by laughing at them . Humour is an invaluable aid in smoothing over the minor frictions of terrestrial life , yet it must not be allowed to obscure basic problems , and the irreconcilability of the two worlds is a very real problem which must be tackled in all seriousness . A valuable first step in escaping the dilemma in which we find ourselves is precisely this , of visualizing these two modes of experience as two separate worlds which , while they interpenetrate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the symbolism of the two interpenetrating triangles called the Star of David ' : s ) . This conception is of course no more than a heuristic aid towards understanding the problem : the two worlds are neither of them objective facts , although many of their contents are , and every entity which is perceived by a consciousness exists concurrently in both of them . What we are concerned with is the form in which anything appears in consciousness , i.e. the manner in which it has been shaped and interpreted in those levels of the mind which select and form the objects of consciousness . The nature of the ultimate image in consciousness , which is what we conceive the external object to be , depends on ( among other things ) whether outer- or  | inner-world principles have been employed in its selection and shaping . The story of Walter Mitty is a brilliant exposition of this theme . Its most striking feature is that the passages of the conscious mind from one world to the other are made without transition or indication of the change : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of a naval commander taking a giant hydroplane through a hurricane , and in the next paragraph , without a word of explanation , we find poor Mitty being reprimanded by his wife for driving the car too fast ; he passes the hospital and suddenly we are in the operating theatre , with Mitty performing prodigies of surgery . If told conventionally , of course , the narrative would contain explanatory transitions : The sight of the hospital evoked pictures in Mitty 's mind of what was going on inside . Probably , he thought , an operation was in progress at this moment ; a human life lay in the balance : everything depended on the surgeon 's skill . Suddenly the scene took shape before him : he saw himself , etc . ' The result would be a trite description of a pipe-dreamer 's ' fantasies , but Thurber 's method leaves the reader , with a delighted thrill of perception , to make the discovery for himself : Of course ! He 's imagining all this ! ' It is in gratitude for that thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure ; it is unlikely that he realizes that he has been put in the way of understanding far more . For the point of the story is not the fact , which everybody knows , that people in general , and more particularly , perhaps , the ineffectual and unsuccessful , are given to seeking compensation for the poverty and disagreeableness of the experiences afforded them in the outer world by availing themselves of the richer and more colourful experiences provided by fancy ; it is far rather that the consciousness of Walter Mitty , which is no more than an artistically exaggerated type of human consciousness in general , exists alternately in two modes , and that , so far as that consciousness is concerned , there are no grounds for saying that either of them is more real ' than the other . This question of reality ' is of the essence of the problem : it will form the subject of the next chapter , and for the moment we may content ourselves with noting that the exclusive reality  | of the outer world , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may touch or see ' , is by no means so self-evident as it might appear at first sight . At other times and in other places , indeed , the prevailing prejudice has been of the opposite nature : the civilization of ancient India , for example , was founded on a philosophy of life which insisted that the material universe was a mere illusion , and that reality was to be found only in the mind ; even in our own Middle Ages the inner life ( often seen as the after-life ' of the soul ) was definitely valued more highly than life in this world . It may at first sight appear absurd to see such abstruse philosophical ideas in the humorous little sketch of Walter Mitty ; but philosophical ideas need not necessarily be expressed in philosophical form . Or , to put it in another way , the philosophical is only one of the possible forms in which an idea can be expressed : it is essentially an academic and intellectual form , from which all but logical and conceptual elements have been rigorously excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a reality on the Archetypal level , is a pattern which embraces aesthetic , symbolical and feeling values besides the intellectual , and it may be brought to expression in any of these media just as well and as truly as in a philosophical dissertation . The Archetypal idea ' of the Two Worlds is clearly expressed in Beethoven 's music , and there is no reason at all why it should not become manifest in a humorous sketch by Thurber . The basic pattern is there , to be seen in the insistence on the equal validity of Mitty 's two modes of experience . The conventional novelist describing Mitty would have used some such forms as I have indicated above : taking the outer-world Mitty as the point of reference he would have insisted that here was the reality ; the excursions into the world of fantasy would have been described as thoughts produced by this character , precisely on a par with his thoughts about his wife or his car . But Thurber shows us that there are in fact two separate Walter Mittys , united , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they share a single stream of consciousness and must therefore alternate in their possession of it . For the inner , the secret Mitty is always the same , no matter in which of the trite heroic roles from film or thriller he appears , and the situations in which he finds himself , varied as they are ,  | have the one characteristic in common , that they are as exciting and dramatic as Mitty 's outer life is dull and prosaic . The picture of the two contrasting lives and of the two contrasting personalities who live them is brilliantly worked out , with an extraordinary economy of means , and the final impression is that , of the two , the inner is the more real : Mitty regards his outer life as no more than a series of vexatious and incoherent interruptions in his far more vividly experienced heroic career . That is why he devotes so little attention to it , and is for ever making a mess of his outer-world activities : he does not build a fantasy-world for himself as a compensation for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer world because , for him at least , the world of fantasy is so much more real than the world of fact . Here we reach the point mentioned earlier : Mitty 's mistake lies in his inability to distinguish between the contrasting natures of the inner and outer worlds , and of the two selves who experience them respectively . It is for this reason that he is a pathetic and , in the last resort , contemptible escapist , who flees from the difficulties of the outer world by taking improper advantage of the facilities of the inner . If he understood the problem he would be able to appease his unsatisfied craving for the symbolical , the dramatic and the colourful elements in which his outer life ( like most outer lives ) is deficient , by the perfectly legitimate and harmless means of imagining exciting situations without seeing his outer-world self as their central character and hero . This is the form of imagining of which the creative artist makes use , and Mitty is potentially creative ; his only trouble is that he stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness , and it is because most people know the creative fantasy only in this distorted form that it is commonly regarded as inferior and even harmful . Thurber himself , of course , is perfectly well aware of this fact . And when we turn to the consideration of actual cases , do we really find that it is only , or even predominantly , the incompetent , the unsuccessful and those who lead dull lives who indulge in fantasies ? From my personal experience I should say it was rather the reverse , for I have known several individuals whose lives were full of interest and excitement and who , in their way , were far from unsuccessful , but who none the less  | indulged in fantasies to a pronounced degree . Such types reveal certain weaknesses in face of outer-world problems , being generally undependable , lacking in consistent application , and liable to act on occasion with a hair-raising irresponsibility and ineptitude ; they may , however , learn to overcome these shortcomings . Often they exhibit outstanding enterprise and determination , and the urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances : in the study of ' T. E. Lawrence a case in point will be considered . Imagination , after all , is indispensable to greatness , and it may well be that the idea that fantasies are nothing but ' inferior and infantile substitutes for real life ' activities is only another product of the contemporary prejudice against the inner world . Fantasies , nevertheless , as the study of Lawrence , and , still more , of Hitler , will show , may be dangerous , or even catastrophic : this is the case when the subject fails to appreciate the contrasting natures of the two worlds and attempts to coerce the outer world to comply with the pattern of the inner . It is impossible to elaborate this thesis until we have progressed considerably further in the study of the characteristic patterns of the two worlds and their contrasting natures ; for the moment we must content ourselves with the observation that Walter Mitty 's dual mode of experience is universal , in a greater or lesser degree , in all human beings ; the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to which the two modes are brought to consciousness and their irreconcilability appreciated . VARIATION IN THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE TWO WORLDS AS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS This is a vital point , because , as we shall see , there is no universally valid dividing line between the two worlds . They consist , as we have noted , of mental systems , according to which diverse experiences are interpreted : the difference lies not in the material itself but in the manner in which it is , so to speak , processed ' and given significance in the mind . Thus , to take a simple example , one man will interpret a feeling of depression and malaise in outer-world terms , attributing it to his digestion or to the weather , whereas another will see it at once as the
