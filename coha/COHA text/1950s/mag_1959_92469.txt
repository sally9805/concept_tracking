It is unfortunate that ballplayers do not arrive in the big leagues neatly packaged in tin cans , with all the specifications on the back label and a tag saying " Do not open until 1959 " on top . Had this happened to Vada Edward Pinson Jr. , the stripling center fielder of the Cincinnati Reds would be well on his way to becoming Rookie of the Year by now . // Pinson was too good for his own good . Opened up a year too soon , at the age of 19 , he went to bat 96 times last season , thereby disqualifying himself from being a 1959 rookie by some six times at bat . The six surplus appearances were acquired in two brief trips to the majors , one at the beginning of the season and the other at the tail end , while most of Pinson 's summer was spent whaling the daylights out of pitching in the Pacific Coast League . But a rule is a rule and this one , passed by the baseball writers one day two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinson is no rookie . He should worry ; for a fellow who is n't a rookie Vada Pinson is the doggondest rookie baseball has seen in years . // He is the only member of the Reds to have played in every game . He is batting .334 , third-best in the National League . He has scored more runs than any player in either league ; he has more doubles and more triples . Only Henry Aaron has more hits . All this has Cincinnati fans howling like happy banshees and opposing pitchers turning red around the ears . // Vada is so trim that he appears frail , but he has muscles that do n't show from the stands . He is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 175 pounds , and he has whacked 16 homers and batted in 73 runs . Fred Hutchinson , the Cincinnati manager , says Pinson has n't yet learned to get a good jump on the pitchers . Still , Vada has stolen 17 bases . And in center field he is leading the league in putouts , a department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Phils for nine of the last 10 years . // " That Vada , " says Frank Robinson , " is making a joke out of this game . " // Pinson is modest , pleasant and almost embarrassingly polite . He has delicate features , sparkling teeth and a pair of soulful brown eyes . He never talks back to his elders or loses his money shooting craps or spits on the dugout steps or takes a snooze on hot days in center field . All he does is play baseball . // Opposing players , who are seldom impressed by headlines and minor league averages and batting-practice home runs , hesitate to elect any new whiz kid to the Hall of Fame until he has been around the league a couple of times . But Pinson has been around the league now half a dozen times , and no one has yet found anything they can do about him . Except go ahead and mark up the ballots . // At the plate , where Pinson hits left-handed , his swing is just like Vada : smooth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes a short , controlled stride , and the bat comes around in a short , controlled arc . If the pitch is in where he wants it , he pulls sharply to right ; if the pitch is away , he goes to center or left . He has not allowed himself to become hypnotized by the home run . // Vada Pinson is so good that he is almost boring . Except that he can run . Boy , how Vada Pinson can run . // " Do n't too many run much faster , " says Hutchinson. // Where Luis Aparicio scurries like a rabbit and Al Kaline moves with a long , deceptive lope , Pinson just flows . His gait resembles the controlled smoothness of Mickey Mantle more than anything else , although he lacks Mantle 's pistonlike power . // He goes down to first in a fraction over three seconds ; if the ball bounces twice he 's there . From first to third he really steams , taking off at the crack of the bat as if launched from a slingshot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust which seem to hang , marveling , in the air . He turns singles into doubles and makes stand-up triples out of base hits that would send most ballplayers sliding frantically into second on the seat of their pants . // " Sometimes , " says Wally Moses , the veteran Cincinnati coach , " he 'll take that turn at first and keep right on going , and I 'll think , ' Boy , you 're out . They 've got you dead this time . ' But he always makes it . Nobody ever throws him out . " // WHAT A SET OF WHEELS ! // " He kids me about my leg hits , " says Frank Robinson , who rooms with Pinson and big-brothers him and occasionally likes to just sit and watch the kid play . " Man , I 'm hitting .315 and if they took all my leg hits away , I 'd still be hitting .315 . But if I had those wheels of his , I 'd be hitting .350. " // In the outfield Pinson is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercepter . As Casey Stengel used to say about Mickey Mantle , " He outruns fly balls . " // It was his dazzling speed that got Pinson into this nonrookie rookie status in the first place . He bewitched Birdie Tebbetts , then Cincinnati manager , at the Reds ' spring training camp at Tampa in 1958. // Tebbetts , who delighted in entertaining the visiting press with stories of his ballplayers , found himself running out of stories . He had to find someone new to talk about or face a fate worse than finishing last , which in this case meant losing his audience to Casey Stengel , who always had a bushel of interesting rookies for wintering journalists to write about in the Yankee camp across the bay at St. Pete . So he turned to Pinson , a kid who had hit .367 and stolen 53 bases at Visalia the year before , leading the Class C California League in just about everything but peanut sales . // Birdie was honest from the start . " Pinson 's not ready , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gives us something to talk about . " // Pinson did . He hit .364 in spring training , stole bases and covered center field like a circus tent . He almost broke Tebbetts ' heart . // " How in the world , " said Birdie , " can I send him down where he belongs as long as he plays like that ? He does a lot of things wrong , but he outruns his mistakes . " // So Pinson stuck with the Reds for a couple of weeks after the season began , hitting a bases-loaded home run in his second big league game and doing well in the field . But eventually his inexperience began to show . His average dropped off badly , and the Reds , with a clear conscience , sent him down . At Seattle he hit .343 and stole 37 bases . // That Pinson 's tremendous performance this season seems to have escaped detection by the headline writers is due to several factors . First , since he does not qualify technically as a rookie , the reams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by . Second , with a Henry Aaron in the league , one does not take much notice of a mere .330 hitter . And , finally , despite the hitting of Pinson and Robinson and Johnny Temple and Gus Bell , the good hit-no pitch Reds have hardly been hot on the trail of a pennant . // Still , it has been an experience to watch him . He was named to the All-Star team , although picked second behind Willie Mays , and his consistency has been remarkable . Only a short slump in midseason , when it was evident that Pinson was getting tired , has slowed him down . // " He needed that break at All-Star time , " says Wally Moses . " He was pooped . It 's been hot , and all he does is run . He 's on base all the time , and he works like a dog in center field . Those fellows on each side of him do n't cover too much ground . " // Is Pinson tired of running ? // " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just rather hit . " // Appreciative as Pinson is of his gifts , he prefers to conserve them . At McClymonds High in Oakland , California  --  which also produced Frank Robinson  --  he played only baseball , passing up basketball and football and track . // " The coaches wanted me to go out for football , " he says , " but I never could see any sense in carrying all that heavy stuff around on your back . I tried basketball awhile , but all you do there is run up and down the floor . And track , well , that interferes with baseball . And besides , I guess nobody really knew I could run very fast . " // Pinson was a pitcher and occasional first baseman in the spring and played a trumpet the rest of the year around . He has since given up pitching and playing first base , and the trumpet is back home on a shelf . // " Bobby Mattick  --  he signed Robinson and Curt Flood , who is with the Cards now , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be an outfielder . So mostly I 've played in the outfield . I pitched one game at the end of my second year in pro ball . Lost it in relief . I do n't care about pitching any more . " // BARGAIN DAY FOR THE REDS // " The Reds were the only team after me big . Some others talked to me , but Cincinnati was the only one offered me any money . And I liked Mattick , the way he treated me , and Robinson was with Cincinnati ; so when I graduated I signed up with the Reds . " They gave him $2,000. // " I 've been very fortunate . Wally Moses has helped me a lot , and my old high school coach , George Powles , helped me most of all . He still works with me in the off season . That 's about all I do all year round is work on baseball . You know , bunting and things like that . I just go up and knock on his door and say ' Hey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Always been like that . " // In the off season , Pinson , an only child , lives with his family back in Oakland , where his father is a stevedore . " I guess that 's where I get my strength , " he says , the muscles rippling across his chest and back and up and down his powerful arms . " But I do n't go looking for those home runs . I just try to hit the ball where it 's pitched . If it goes out , fine . If not , I 'll take what I can get . " // Vada Pinson wo n't get to be Rookie of the Year because of a rule . He wo n't win the batting championship because of Henry Aaron . He wo n't win a Most Valuable Player award this year , either , because the Reds are going nowhere . But all Vada Pinson has to do is keep on swinging and running . First thing you know he 'll have a trophy case full of batting championship and Most Valuable Player awards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been turned into a plaque on the wall at Cooperstown , the first left-handed trumpet player in Baseball 's Hall of Fame . // How can you stop a guy who outruns his mistakes ?
