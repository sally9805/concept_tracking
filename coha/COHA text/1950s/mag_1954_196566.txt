In this congressional election year , the vote-chaser 's farm program would be a pleasantly flavored nostrum designed to produce a surplus of votes . This week , in the farm message he sent to Congress , President Eisenhower turned away from the politically expedient course . He faced the facts of life down on the farm . <P> The facts are uncomfortable . Granaries and warehouses are bulging with surplus farm crops-wheat , corn , cotton , dairy products-all paid for by the Government . Present farm laws still encourage production of surpluses . To meet 1954 commitments , the Administration had to ask for an increase from $6.7 billion to $8.5 billion in the amount it can spend on the price-support program . To meet the long-range aspects of the problem , the President and Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson proposed a basic change in the farm program . <P> " Insulations . " Most important of the proposals : a shift , in 1955 , to flexible supports for basic farm crops , e.g. , wheat , corn and cotton . The basic-crop prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower program , a return to the principles of the farm bill passed by the 80th Congress , support prices would slide down to 75% of parity when a crop is in surplus , rise to 90% when it is scarce . The theory : farmers , with an eye on the support price , would base their planting on the law of supply &; demand . To cushion the effects of the change to flexible supports , the Federal Government would limit the rate at which support prices could drop to 5% a year . It would also " insulate " $2.5 billion worth of Government-held surpluses , taking them out of the normal channels and diverting them to special uses , e.g. , school-lunch programs and famine relief abroad . <P> There would be specific changes for various crops , e.g. , corn-support prices would be allowed to drop faster than others because most corn , used to feed livestock , never leaves the farm on which it is grown . <P> Said Eisenhower , in his State of the Union message : " This farm program . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply , and move food into consumption instead of into storage ... It promises our farmers a higher and steadier financial return over the years than any alternative plan . " <P> Help Needed . Other possible ways of handling the farm-price problem : <P> 1 ) Ending price supports . This is politically unthinkable . <P> 2 ) Continuing the present system , in which Government supports build up bigger and bigger surpluses for the Government to buy , thus encouraging still bigger and bigger surpluses , and so on . <P> 3 ) Keeping rigid supports while cutting surpluses by stricter limitations of acreage , farm by farm , thus putting every farmer under Government control . <P> Despite the danger of these three other courses , Ike 's program faced a rough time in Congress . The 1954 elections may well turn on the farm vote . Farmers are worried , sore over falling incomes , restive . If Benson is to get his program passed , he will need all the help Ike can give him . <P>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
