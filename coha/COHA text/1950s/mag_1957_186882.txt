A tractor-trailer to take some of the drudgery out of long-haul trucking has been developed for National Van Lines by General Body Co. and White Motor Co .

Back half of the unit is the equivalent of a rolling motel ; instead of a cramped bunk behind the driver 's head , the tractor has a small room with two bunks and a lavatory for the crew . Cost of the tractor : $12,500.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
