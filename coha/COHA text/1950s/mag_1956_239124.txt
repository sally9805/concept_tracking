Dear TIME-Reader : <P> <P> NEWSPAPERMEN generally keep a sharp eye on TIME 'S Press section , which always keeps a sharp eye on them . Last week Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Political Reporter Frank M. Matthews prefaced a story with an excerpt from TIME 'S Oct. 8 Press report , " The Campaign Trail " : " The Nixon and Stevenson campaign tours are models of efficiency . The pampered newsmen with Stevenson need not even bother to register at their hotel stopovers . " Then Pittsburgh Reporter Matthews whooped : " Well , Mr. Luce and TIME Magazine , we 've got news for you . " <P> His news : Clouds grounded the newsmen in Elkins , W. Va. , buses bounced them over back roads to Pennsylvania , hotel rooms were reserved and unreserved in Pittsburgh , and eventually , when they caught up with Candidate Stevenson in New York , the rally for him in Harlem was over . In short , wrote Reporter Matthews in his light-hearted spoof , most of the efficiency and all pamper had been lost on the campaign trail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps the revealing cover story on Michigan State Football Coach Duffy Daugherty and the detailed diagrams of some of his key plays ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) might have given powerful Michigan the edge to win again this year . Gamblers around New York made Michigan a 2-to-5-point favorite , but Duffy 's team knocked over the Wolverines ( see SPORT ) and now appear headed for another Big Ten title . <P> <P> WHEN Contributing Editor Spencer L. Davidson went down to Herman Talmadge 's 2,400-acre plantation below Atlanta for a closeup of this week 's cover subject , he discovered that his visit was a bit untimely . It was the tail end of the dove season , and Governor Talmadge , an ardent hunter , was eager to get out into the millet fields . Writer Davidson , a city boy from Baltimore , went along . " I guess , " he says ruefully , " I 'm the only guy who ever went dove hunting in a grey flannel suit . " On the second afternoon afield , " Spence " fired and missed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with watching his sharpshooting host . <P> <P> AS this issue of TIME closed , our editorial staff discovered it had some lovely reasons for an impromptu party : three orchid-decked researchers ablush and abeam with plans for marriage . Education 's Marjorie Burns will be married to Research Physicist A. Bruce Brown Jr . on Oct. 19 , Art 's Joan Dye to Artist Alan Gussow on Oct. 21 , and Foreign News 's Monica von Swogetinsky to Lawyer Dudley Devine in December or January . Cheers and best wishes to all ! <P> Cordially yours ,
