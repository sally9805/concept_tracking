In many of Louis Wolfson 's battles and deals , his associate was David B. Charnay , longtime New York Daily News reporter , now chairman and part owner of a Manhattan public relations firm . Last November Wolfson sold a trailer company controlled by one of his interests to Detroit 's Trans Continental Industries , of which Charnay is chairman , and it became Trans Continental 's chief asset . Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered a ten-day suspension of trading in Trans Continental stock on the American and Detroit stock exchanges . Reason : " To prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices . " <P> The SEC charged that Trans Continental shares were being sold by telephone by high-pressure operators , with the claim that the stock would double in 30 to 60 days and that the company had a good profit position and would soon declare a substantial dividend . The truth of the matter , said SEC , is that the company has operated at a loss since 1955 . It can not pay dividends until it pays off $3,000,000 in loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being conducted by an unnamed " foreign source , " which had pushed the stock from 2 ? to 4 in a few days . <P> Trans Continental management denied any complicity in the selling , said it did not even know about it . One question the SEC may want answered as it investigates : Where did the high-pressure operators get their hands on a large enough chunk of stock to peddle ?
