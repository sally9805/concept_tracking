Back in wartime February 1945 , when the U.S. and Russia were still allies , Rumania was a free country , its King a well-intentioned young man named Michael . Last week in London , before a committee of U.S. Congressmen , Michael of Rumania recalled one of the incidents which led him to fire his own Premier , and in time led him to become an ex-king . Soviet Diplomat Andrei Vishinski had dropped around to the palace in Bucharest several times before to complain about unrest on the Rumanian home front . " This time , " said ex-King Michael , " he was extremely violent . He again demanded to know what was happening . <P> " I said : ' I am doing things in our manner and according to the interests of my country , and besides , the conference at Yalta says that every country is free to choose its own form of government . ' <P> " Whereupon he said , ' In this case , I am Yalta , and I tell you what to do . . . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table and said that this evening , at 6 o'clock , he wishes to hear that Radescu the Premier has resigned and at the same time wishes to hear the name of the new man I appoint ... It was then 3 o'clock . <P> " After he got up and banged his fist , out he walked and slammed the door so hard the plaster wall shattered . I was told later that as he was walking to get into the car , he and his interpreter were both laughing their heads off . "
