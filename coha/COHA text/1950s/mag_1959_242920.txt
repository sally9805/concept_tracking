Much can be said of Fidel Castro 's wild schemes , but no one can accuse him of lacking imagination . In the high name of the revolution last week Castro nationalized 1 ) Cuba 's bat guano caves , 2 ) every chicken egg in Havana province and 3 ) Santa Claus , who has gradually become the symbol of Christmas through much of Latin America . <P> Santa , ruled Castro 's director of culture , Vicentina Antua , is out because he is " a recent importation from the U.S. and foreign to our culture . " From now on Cuban children will expect presents from the Three Wise Men on January 6 , the feast of the Epiphany . No cardboard Santas or reindeer will be permitted . " Decorations must be made of Cuban materials , with traditional Cuban scenes , " ruled Senora Antua , " and Cuban Christmas cards must be used instead of imported ones . " Yankee Christmas trees are out ; everyone will use the good Cuban palm . <P> Havana 's egg business became exclusive property of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castro is upset about overproduction and a drastic drop in prices . Farmers must sell their eggs at dictated prices to INRA , which will hold back part of the crop from market . Bat guano is an even more ambitious INRA undertaking , first sparked by Entrepreneur Bud Arvey ( son of Chicago Democratic Bigwig Jake Arvey ) , who hit Cuba last spring with a plan to join the Castro government in a $500,000 partnership to scrape the guano deposits from caves in Pinar del Rio and Matanzas and ship it abroad as fertilizer . Castro decided that the commodity was much too valuable to share . In turning over exclusive control of bat guano to sprawling INRA , Castro noted that INRA Director Captain Antonio Nez Jimnez is an expert spelunker , just the man to get in there and get the merchandise moving .
