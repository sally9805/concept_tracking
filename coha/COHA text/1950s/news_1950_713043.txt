txt Frank Erickson , the gambler , was sentenced yesterday to two years in the penitentiary and fined $30,000 , the maximum , on his plea of guilty to a sixty-count criminal information charging conspiracy and bookmaking . The heavy-set , 54-year-old defendant also received an additional three-year suspended sentence with the court 's proviso that he " never again engage in professional gambling . " The sentence , imposed in Special Sessions by Presiding Justice Nathan D. Perlman and Associate Justices John V. Flood and Frank Oliver , came almost two months from the day in April when Erickson testified in Washington before a Senate subcommittee studyij-g the interstate transmission of racing information . This move , which was later described by his attorney as " ill advised , " enmeshed Erickson in an unhappy situation where , to explain his livelihood , he had to admit that for the last thirty years he had violated the laws of every state . Silent During Proceedings After sentence was pronounced by Justice Perlman , the defendant was whisked by courtroom officers to an adjoining detention pen . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pronouncement , Erickson was silent . As he headed into the pen , a reporter asked , " Have you anything to say , Frank ? " " Not a word , " he replied , waving his left hand in a motion that caused his gray fedora hat to whirl about his finger . Later , Erickson was transferred to the City Prison . This morning he will be taken by prison van to the city penitentiary on Rikers Island . Yesterday afternoon Erickson passed his first hours of imprisonment in a lifetime that had been marked by ten arrests but never had included a day spent in jail . Although receiving a two-year sentence , the prisoner , who has been called the " biggest and most notorious bookmaker in the country , " may be eligible for release in October , 1951 , after serving sixteen months . An official of the Department of Correction said that Erickson would be entitled to ten days off each month for good behavior . Hogan Urged ** Term Prior to the imposition of sentence , District Attorney Frank S. Hogan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the defendant a straight five-year term as well as the maximum $30,000 fine . The information in which Erickson was cited was composed of one count of conspiracy and fifty-nine counts of bookmaking . Both conspiracy and bookmaking are misdemeanors and the penalty on each count amounts to one year 's imprisonment and a $500 fine . The gambler 's counsel , Sol Gelb , a former chief assistant under Mr. Hogan , argued that Erickson was a victim of a prevalent social evil and that his case should be considered in that light . When both attorneys completed their extended remarks to the court , the three justices retired to their chambers to deliberate . Justice Flood 's appearance on the bench was a late change that occurred when Justice Joseph V. Loscaizo asked to be excused for " personal reasons . " Justice Perlman did not amplify his statement other than to say , " The Chief Justice John J. Bennett has assigned Judge Flood in his place . " It was recalled that on Oct. 25 , 1943 , when Frank Costello testified during the unsuccessful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court Justice , the gambler said that Justice Loscaizo had telephoned him for " political advice . " The name of Justice Loscalzo , then . a former Assistant District Attorney in Queens , was brought up by Justice Aurelio in his telephone call to Costello assuring him of " undying " loyalty for his aid in obtaining the Democratic nomination : for the Supreme Court , the gambler said . Costell testified that he was informed that Mr. Loscalzo was anxious to be nominated either for a county judgeship or the District Attorneyship . Costello said that at Justice Loscaizo 's request he introduced him to Michael J. Kennedy , then leader of Tammany Hall . The justices returned to the bench within ten minutes and Erickson rose to hear their finding . The jurist commended Mr. Hogan for his " vigorous prosecu-1 tion " of Erickson and told Mr. Gelb his client had been " wise " in pleading guilty to the charges on June 19 . The court then announced a sentence of one year and a $500 fine , on the first count  --  the conspiracy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the second count  --  the first of the fifty-nine , bookmaking allegations . Justice Perlman ordered the sentences to run consecutively . As the justice imposed the jail sentence , Erickson 's chin sagged and he looked questioningly a ' , his attorney . Then he resumed his , stoical attitude as Justice Perlman went on . tently at the man who for years paid him $70 weekly to bank his funds , made no attempt to approach him . Mr. Hogan , accompanied by a retinue of aides , including the head of his rackets bureau , Assistant District Attorney Alfred J. Scotti , came in shortly after Erickson . The justices filed into their places at 10:09 and Justice Perlman said , " All right , " to the court attendant . The latter called out , " Number 4 , Frank Erickson , " and the gambler and his attorney took seats before the bench as Mr. Hogan flanked Erickson on the defendant 's right . Gelb Seeks to Follow Hogan Justice Perlman then announced " for the record " that Justice Loscalzo had asked to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the District Attorney , but this request was denied and the defense lawyer began to petition the court . In his plea for leniency , Mr. Gelb said that Erickson as a gambler and bookmaker " was part and parcel of the weaknesses of our society manifested all too clearly day by day . " He said bookmaking was considered " an evil influence in the community , " but ' pointed out that it was " a product , of the public . " " The defendant is charged with being a large bookmaker , " Mr. Gelb said . " How should society treat him ? Mind you , bookmaking is a subject that has baffled the best minds of our country . No one knows how to solve it . " Saying that there " are not enough jails to house everyone who would be jailed for violating the bookmaking law , " Mr. Gelb declared that the efforts to enforce the prohibition law twenty years ago were not much different from those used to enforce the bookmaking law . Mr. Gelb characterized the investigation and prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked , " Are we looking for a sacrifical offering to ease the public for its vices ? " Calling upon the justices to use " judicial statesmanship " in considering his client , Mr. Gelb asserted that whatever might be said about Erickson " he was never anything else but a gambler . " Mr. Hogan , saying he would address the court " without vengeance in my heart , " denied that in any bench , each seemed a proponent of the two sides of a debate on cause and effect . To Mr. Gelb , Erickson was the natural development of the public 's propensity for gambling . Mr. Hogan contended Erickson had developed through financial maneuvering with " infamous characters of the underworld , including notorious Frank Costello . " The prosecutor said investigation of Erickson had " evolved " a new technique for the prosecution of bookmaking suspects . He said the method would be to utilize all financial records of a defendant and to bring in for trial testimony as many of his betting clientele as could be found . The method was put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate subcommittee . Mr. Hogan raided the gambler 's Park Avenue office and seized " voluminous " records . Through bank statements obtained from an institution where the gambler maintained a sizable account , the prosecutor uncovered the names of many " business men bettors " who placed their wagers with the bookmaker . These bettors were called in to testify before a grand jury and their testimony resulted in the return of the information on May 31 . Referring to Erickson 's complex business set-up , which was uncovered after a seizure of the gambler 's financial records at 487 Park Avenue on May 2 , Mr. Hogan declared Erickson 's employes served* as a " protective layer " between himself and the law . He of the employes had gone to prison but they had always protected Erickson . Mr. Hogan contended the defendant was a " top man in a dirty business , " who had served as a " master mechanic in the nation 's biggest racket . " Saying that the defendant " has been adroit in circumventing the law , " the District Attorney attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to gain a position as the country 's biggest professional gambler . As both attorneys Petitioned the Alternative on Fines On counts three , four an ' .. five , the court stayed execution , of oneyear terms but imposed the fine of $500 on each count . Summing up the fifty-five other counts , Justice Perlman said there would be a fine of $500 on each with th alternative of thirty days in jail foz each $500 not paid . However , Justice Perlman said the $30,000 fir. : could be paid at any time before the expiration of the penitentiary term . At 9:55 A.

As he walked down the long corridor leading to Part VI of Special Sessions , photographers and newsreel cameramen lighted his path with an eerie incandescence of flashbulbs and kleig lights .
