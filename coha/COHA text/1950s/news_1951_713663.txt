txt WASHINGTON , March 2 ? Roy Fruehauf , Detroit trailer manufacturer , swore before a Senate investigating subcommittee today that Joseph H. Rosenbaum , Washington attorney linked with charges of influence and favoritism in the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , had boasted to him that he had two R. F. C. directors  --  Walter L. Dunham and William E. Willett 1 ? " in his hip pocket . " Mr. Fruehauf then accused Mr. Dunham of blocking plans to save the Lustron prefabricated housing enterprise at Columbus , Ohio , from bankruptcy when a $10,000 check delivered to Mr. Rosenbaum as part of a $100,000 fee was withdrawn . Mr. Rosenbaum entered prompt denial to the " hip pocket " charge and to further testimony that he had stated at a meeting of Lustron stockholder representatives that Mr. Willett sought his advice on Lustron matters . He denied also that he had watched out for the interests of E. Merl Young , a former R. F. C. examiner since cited as an influential power in R. F. C. matters . Mr Young , who carries a pass for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been in // vestigated intensively during the R. F. C. inquiry , was simultaneously an $18,000-a-year Lustron vice president and $10,000-a-year official of the F. L. Jacobs Company of Detroit , another R. F. C. borrower . Denies Knowing Dunham Mr. Rosenbaum declared that he did not even know Mr. Dunham and never had seen him . His contacts with Mr. Willett , he said , had been few . Mr. Fruehauf testified under subpoena as a witness having almost a 63,000,000 stake in the Lustron case . His company had a $4,000,000 contract to build , all in one vehicle , a trailer that would serve as assembly line , warehouse , and transporter of Lustron houses to their site . The Fruehauf stake represented the unpaid balance . Lustron had borrowed ? $37,500,000 from the R. F. C. The lending agency foreclosed . Mr. Rosenbaum , in one of his several recalls for testimony , was asked to explain how it was that Mr. Young , after Mr. Rosenbaum had sold him for $500 a half interest in an option on the stock of the Atlantic Basin Iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrow some $30,000 from that company for the purchase of a $52,000 home . Reports from New York had been to the effect that Atlantic Basin was sold to Blair &; Co. , New York investment bankers , in 1947 , that its industrial property had been sold at auction in 1948 and that its buildings were disposed of early last year , apparently before the Young loan was made . Mr. Rosenbaum said the Atlantic had assets , some of which were tied up in controversy . Mr. Rosenbaum explained that the Rialb Corporation ( " Blair " spelled backwards ) had been formed and that if the RosenbaumYoung option was picked up within a certain time the assets of Atlantic could be acquired for $9,000 but that the price would rise to $24,000 later . As the continued his explanation , Senator Fulbright interposed to observe that he had become lost beyond his comprehension . It might be better , he said , to have the Blair Company forward a written explanation to be put into the record along with the contracts involved . Mr. Fruehauf told the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Lustron and about being urged by Mr. Buckley to rush to Washington later in January of last year . " I went directly to the Wardman Park Hotel , " he said , " to the suite occupied by Mr. C. L. Schneider vice president of Fruehauf Trailer Company , and James Gottlieb , head of the hauling company , Commercial Home Equipment Company a company formed to handle the Lustron trailer business , arriving there about 8 P. M. " Buckley was in the suite * * * and told me that there was only one man who could save the Lustron situation and that was a Washington attorney who had represented Buckley in several matters previously . After a few min= utes Col. Joseph Rosenbaum entered the suite and joined the conference with Buckley and me . I had never met Rosenbaum , but I had hehrd of him before about two years ago when some of the Fruehauf officials told nfe he was at our office and wanted to represent us in some of our tax work . Talked With Rosenbaum " I know that reputable lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and.told the other officials to have nothing to do with him and to get rid of him . Schneider and Gottlieb left the room , but Buckley remained with Rosenbaum and me . " Rosenbaum told me that he absolutely could save Lustron through his friends at the R. F. C. , Dunham and Willett , who he said were ' in his hip pocket ' ; and he was confident that no one else except himself would be able to save Lustron . " Mr. Fruehauf said Mr. Rosenbaum told him he ( Mr. Rosenbaum ) had made arrangements for a conference with Mr. Dunham and Mr. Willett at the lending agency . the following morning , but that he wanted to confer with Alfonso Landa , his regular Washington attorney , before going farther .. He said Mr. Rosenbaum objected to this but finally agreed that Mr. Landa could go too . After Mr. Rosenbaum left the suite , Mr. Fruehauf resumed , Mr. Gottlieb returned and showed him a letter which he said Mr. Rosenbaum had left with him . " I read the letter , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be signed by Commercial Home Equipment Company , and provided for the immediate payment of a retainer to Rosenbaum of $25,000 , with further future payments of an additional $75,000 . Rosenbaum had not discussed a fee with me . " The following morning I reported the details of my experience to Landa . Landa disapproved emphatically of Rosenbaum 's employment and said the entire proposal , including the approach , bore all the earmarks of a Washington ' fix ' . James Gottlieb told me he would not employ Rosenbaum . " The same day , while I was still in Washington , I received a telephone call from Rex Jacobs . Jacobs told me that I was making a mis- , take not to join forces with Rosenbaum and that I had the wrong attorney . Later in the day Jacobs ely.betra , te4 on his advice that I would be foolish not to take Rosenbaum 's proposal . " Mr. Jacobs , recalled , said his advice concerning Mr. Rosenbaum had to do with Commercial Company tax matters , not representation before the R. F. C. Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had conferred with directors of the lending agency and had found them apparently eager for the working out of a plan to save Lustron . This was in the morning . By afternoon , when he returned for a conference with Mr. Dunham , he testified , Mr. Dunham 's attitude had changed . " He was outspoken in his resistance to any suggestion , constructive or otherwise , " he said , " to help Lustron . His statements became incoherent and irrational ; he was most adamant that Lustron must cease operation . " I was completely puzzled at Dunham 's change of face until a short time afterward when James Gottlieb talked to me privately . He told me that some days before he had given Rosenbaum a check for $10,000 under an agreement that it not be cashed for one week . * * * Sees Reason for Reversal " Then the reason for Dunham 's reversal of attitude was clear between my 9 A. M. conference with him and my noon appointment . Between my two visits , Gottlieb had gone to see Rosenbaum and taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time limit on holding the check had not been one week , but an indefinite period . The check was withdrawn , he insisted , the day after Mr. Freuhauf had left Washington , not while he was here . He said John Gottlieb , a brother of James and also an officer of the Commercial Company , had come in and asked for the check , giving no explanation and that he had returned it without asking for one . He said his caller had rushed in and rushed out . Another check for $10,000 , Mr. Rosenbaum said , was taken under an agreement , a copy of which was produced for the . record , under which an additional $90,000 ' would be paid if matters worked out to the satisfaction og the company , in one payment of $40,000 and $25,000 mere for each of two years . The fee , was asked as an attorney , Mr .. Rosenbaum said , and it was his right to charge one . He said he cashed that check . , Mr. Fruehauf told a meeting of stockholders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men , representing nearly 100. per cent of Lustron stock , had offered to set up a new plan designed to accord with R. F. C. requirements .
