On their own , Nationalist pilots flying U.S.-built F-86 Sabre jets put on a superb show against the Communists ' faster , Russian-built MIG-17s last week . <P> As the Sabre jets were flying cover for reconnaissance planes one morning , three swarms of MIG-17s buzzed in from the north , south and east , tried to box the Nationalists against the mainland . The Sabre jets were outnumbered , 100 to 32 . But in a stop-and-go , five-hour battle that extended along a 400-mile arc along the coast ( and 50 miles inland ) , the Sabres danced a jig around the MIGs . When the Nationalist pilots rolled back to Taipei to be saluted with firecrackers and garlanded with flowers , the scorecard read : ten MIGs downed , at least three others crippled . Nationalist losses : none . <P> Since the battle of Quemoy began Aug. 23 , the Nationalists have downed 29 MIGs , damaged nine . Nationalist losses : none . A major factor is the superiority of Nationalist pilots , many of whom have logged up to 1,400 hours in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. pilots stationed on Formosa . The Communist pilots , kept from training by a jet-fuel shortage , have proved no match for them . The gun camera films show that the Red Chinese pilots scatter across the skies . Trained in U.S. tactics , the Nationalists fly in tight pairs and foursomes , allowing them to jump single Red stragglers with impunity . Despite official reticence , there are reliable reports that the U.S. has equipped some Nationalist planes with Sidewinders-a deadly , heat-seeking missile that guides itself to its target by seeking out the heat produced by a plane 's jet blast . The Chinese Reds have no answer to the Sidewinder . <P> Under fire , Red pilots have shown their inexperience . Some have crash-dived into the sea trying to escape . One Nationalist pilot came up on the tail of a MIG . To his astonishment , the confused Red panicked , put on his brake flaps , slowed to 100 m.p.h . " I should n't really take credit for that one , " said the pilot . " It was just like shooting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
