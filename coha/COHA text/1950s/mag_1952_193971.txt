At the tag end of an 18-hour workday , General Mohammed Naguib , Egypt 's reluctant strong man , and his eager-beaver officers gathered around a radio in Abbas-sia barracks . They tuned in to hear their hand-picked Premier , Aly Maher , report to the nation . When the Premier had finished , the officers were disappointed and mad . Why had n't Aly spelled out his proposed social and economic reforms instead of merely saying that reforms were on the way ? The Premier had been long on generalities , short on specifics . His only hard &; fast promise was a pledge to lift press censorship . To a country tingling for change , this was hardly enough . <P> The officers set to work . Shortly after 2:30 that morning , Cairo editors got a statement , bearing Naguib 's signature , that was as sharp and pointed as Aly 's had been rambling and evasive . Naguib , speaking for the army , called for elections in February , measures to encourage industrialization , the breakup of large estates and distribution of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for taxing the poor man 's tobacco . <P> The next morning , restless Cairo buzzed . Had the split come between the army and its chosen politician ? Had Naguib now decided to abandon his nonpolitical " simple soldier " role and to rule in fact instead of by proxy ? Emissaries from Egypt 's most powerful party , the corrupt Wafd , rushed to Aly 's side offering their support should he decide to stand up to the army . But though annoyed by Naguib 's counter-proclamation , Aly snapped no and went into conference with the general who later announced that a special committee would synchronize army and government policies . <P> Naguib 's undiplomatic show of strength accomplished its purpose . . Aly Maher 's cabinet announced the details of the army 's land-reform law , and proclaimed the law as its own . <P> The fertile Nile , cradle of a once-great civilization , is today one of the world 's great slums . Desert covers 96% of Egypt , leaving less than six million acres of arable land , clinging in a narrow green strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , in the most densely populated rural area in the world . The wealthy one-tenth of one percent of Egypt 's landowners hold almost 60% of the land . The army proposes to break up all estates of more than 200 acres , sell the surplus acreage to fellaheens with less than two acres apiece . This would create more than 350,000 new peasant landowners . The government would repay the landlords in 30 years ; the newly landed peasants would have even longer to repay the government . Landlords could be jailed for five years for obstructing redistribution . <P> Naguib 's plan was a bold one . He showed his hand elsewhere : <P> The government set up seven purge committees to probe every dark corner of Egyptian public life-from dealings in public lands to cotton-market manipulations and the Palestine arms scandal .
