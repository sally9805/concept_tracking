" There is nothing wrong with being a hack writer , " says self-styled Hollywood Hack Leslie ( The Marriage-Go-Round ) Stevens . " I would point with pride to the inspired hacking of Shakespeare , Michelangelo-you can go through a big list . I am a firm believer in Hollywood 's golden future , and thumb my nose at those who cry ' Twilight in the Smog . ' " <P> Commanding a null income at 35 , pudgy , archangel-faced Leslie Stevens is one of the hottest writer-tycoons in or out of the smog . He is also one of Hollywood 's new breed : the curious combination of corporation executive and creative artist that is taking over the town . On Broadway , Stevens ' Marriage-Go-Round , with Charles Boyer and Claudette Colbert , is spinning briskly into its second season . The pilot shows for a couple of TV series are ready for production . The Pink Jungle , his new , Broadway-bound comedy about the cosmetics industry , is in rehearsal . And last week he was busy editing the film of Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevens , Property was produced in Stevens ' own Hollywood backyard , has Stevens ' actress wife ( Kate Manx ) as its star , cost only $60,000 , and has already brought bids of more than $300,000-although the movie has yet to win Hollywood 's Production Code seal of approval . <P> Profit on Property . Chances are only fifty-fifty , Stevens admits , that Property will get the code 's approval . It is the story of two switchblade hoodlums and their step-by-step seduction of a sex-starved housewife . Murder ( at the bottom of the Stevens swimming pool ) , sadism , and an uncommonly forgiving husband are all crammed into the script . <P> Stevens confidently expects to turn a profit on Property . " There 's been a firm connection between writing and money in my head , " says he , " ever since I was ten and my father* paid me a penny a line for learning Shakespeare . " <P> To learn the writer 's craft , he ran away from a Washington , D.C. high school to tour with Orson Welles ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put in a couple of years in stock , went to Yale Drama School . Then he moved hopefully to Broadway . " As a playwright , " he remembers , " I achieved the rank of hotel night clerk at 22 , nightward attendant in a psychiatric hospital at 25 , a magazine copy boy at 28 . " It was while he was a copy boy ( at TIME ) that his play Bullfight became an off-Broadway hit . <P> A couple of Broadway turkeys slowed him hardly at all . He moved to Hollywood , began to grind out TV shows , a movie script and , finally , The Marriage-Go-Round . Everything he touched turned to money . And as he tried to fend off the tax collector , his corporate complex became as complicated as any in the New Hollywood , where tax angles are more important than camera angles .
