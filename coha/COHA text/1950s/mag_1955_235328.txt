Are virgin births possible in nature ? In guppies , yes , because the female may be a hermaphrodite and , by producing sperm as well as ova , fertilize herself . In rabbits , fatherless reproduction has been observed after the doe 's ovaries are chilled . But in humans ? Maybe , says the Lancet of London , and last week doctors went to work to see whether there are living proofs in England today . <P> Britain 's interest in a topic long pigeonholed by science was spurred by a report that Eugenist Helen Spurway gave at University College in London . Among humans , she declared , virgin birth could not happen in the case of a hermaphrodite , who would not be self-fertile . However , parthenogenesis* might occur . This is the process by which an ovum begins to divide spontaneously , without having been fertilized by a sperm-perhaps after it has made up for the missing male chromosomes by a form of doubling . It is almost certain that the offspring of parthenogenesis would be a female , since the ovum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur at all , it is extremely rare , " said the Lancet , However , this is no reason for dismissing the idea entirely : " A rare event which is hard to prove is likely never to be reported at all if it is also . . . ' known ' to be impossible . . . Possibly some of the unmarried mothers whose obstinacy is condemned in old books . . . may have been telling the truth . " <P> How to be sure ? Dr. Spurway suggests that a woman who claims such a pregnancy can be tested by a skin-grafting operation if the child is born alive . Ordinarily , no skin graft from one human being to another ( except between identical twins ) " takes " permanently , because of cell differences . A normal child 's cells are slightly different even from the mother 's , because they have some of the father 's antigens . A successful graft from child to mother would show that the child had received no antigens from any other source . <P> As soon as Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward with claims of virgin births . Two were married . Doctors promptly began checking the claimants ( names withheld ) , first to be sure that they were serious and sincere , next for blood types . Any blood difference between mother and daughter would throw out the claim . Only after these tests are passed will there be occasion for the decisive skin-graft tests . <P> <P> * From the Greek irapOkvos , virgin-as in Parthenon , temple of the virgin goddess Athena.
