But Mr. Dove is much too keen To let a single bird be seen ; To show the pigeons would not do And so he simply paints the coo . <P> <P> Thus , in 1912 , the Chicago Tribune 's Bert Leston Taylor lampooned an extraordinary show by a 31-year-old painter . Except for its jeering tone , the jingle was an accurate enough statement of the creed of Painter Arthur G. Dove ( 1880-1946 ) , who avowedly intended to paint such things as the sensation of the wind blowing on a hill , without necessarily showing either wind or hill . Chicago was as unconvinced by Dove 's works as Manhattan had been a few weeks earlier . ( " They were over the heads of the people , " admitted pioneer Art Dealer-Photographer Alfred Stieglitz . ) Broke but not discouraged , Dove borrowed the train fare back to New York . <P> How far he traveled on his lonely way is shown by the largest-ever collection of Dove 's work now starting a crosscountry tour at Manhattan 's Whitney Museum , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Dove ; University of California ; $2 ) . Together they go far to establish Dove 's status as the U.S. 's first abstract painter and a pivotal figure in contemporary art . <P> Much as Maine Painter John Marin ( another Stieglitz protege ) chose the sky as his province , Dove made the earth and sea his domain . To get closer to both , he moved out of Manhattan , where he had been a successful illustrator , and bought a farm in Westport , Conn. , began raising chickens . When that venture failed , he tried his hand at being a lobsterman . Art , he decided , should not depend so much on natural forms as on substituting equivalent images for them . He was searching for a means of expression that would not depend on representation , that " should have order , size , intensity , spirit , nearer to the music of the eye . " <P> <P> At the age of 40 , Dove left his wife and son , went to live on a scow on Manhattan 's Harlem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy an old 42-ft. yawl from his friend and benefactor , William S. Hart , oldtime cowboy star of the silent movies . With his second wife , he cruised Long Island Sound for the next eleven years . Wind , water and sand became the essence of some of Dove 's best work . Ferry Boat Wreck-Oyster Bay ( 1931 ) catches the essence of a lurking hulk beneath the sound 's green water and the fiery color of rusting iron ; Fog Horns ( 1929 ) is an abstraction of sound any sailor becalmed in a fog would recognize . <P> Toward the end of his life , as he lay dying in an abandoned post office in Centerport , L.I . that he had bought as a studio-home , he watched the sea gulls flying past his window . " Their beaks , " he wrote , " look like ivory thrown slowly through space . " In words , it was the quality and response to nature Dove had spent all his life attempting to capture in paint .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
