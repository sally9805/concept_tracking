txt The administration has won its long-fought battle for a flexible farm . price-support system , and the flsenhower-Benson policy now becomes an issue in the November elections . The President 's victory on the agricultural front was settled Aug. ' 9 when administration forces in the Senate routed the " farm bloc " in two key tests . They won flexible price supports on five basic crops  --  wheat , cotton , corn , peanuts , rice  --  and beat down attempts - to raise props on dairy products . A Senate vote of 49 to 44 on a compromise version of the original administration stand  --  permitting price supports to dip from 90 per cent to as low as 821/2 per cent instead of the original 80 or 75 per cent  --  was the margin of victory . There is sharp dispute as to the likely political effects from the administration 's flexible-support stand . Senator Milton R. Young ( R ) of grain-growing North Dakota forecast the Eisenhower victory would turn into Republican defeat in November . Others warmly disagree . GOP Backs President Thirty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Democrats made it more of a party-line fight , voting 33 to 12 against the administration . During the final arguments , the administration received a strong assist from Senator Clinton P. Anderson ( D ) of New Mexico , under whose regimen as Secretary of Agriculture in the Truman administration the flexible idea was worked out . Senator Anderson argued that in 1948 President Truman carried the farm states while favoring flexible supports , whereas Adlai Stevenson did not win in the farm states although advocating rigid supports . Despite all the political excitement , a change to flexible price supports on five basic crops will have only a modest present effect . Wheat , the most directly affected , will drop 16 cents a bushel in 1955 , to $2.05 . The five basic crops account for only 20 per cent of the value of all farm products but , together with dairy products , they constitute the tremendous pileup of farm surpluses now in excess of six billion dollars ' worth which are bulging out of storage warehouses . ( Benson Campaign Later , on Aug. 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing off an effort to give mandatory support to feed grains and soy beans . The administration has argued widely throughout the farm states that a sliding scale of supports is essential to bring a better balance between production and consumption . Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson 's crusade has paid off , although he has had to compromise . Mr. Benson 's idea is to lower the support level on specific crops in times of surplus , to discourage production , and to raise it in years of scarcity . Farm-bloc senators argue that a drop in supports now will have disastrous effects on agriculture , since farm ' income already had suffered a 13 per cent drop last year . One problem is that no years of scarcity are in sight . It is very nearly a situation where there are too many farmers . In the Senate battle the farm group had demanded continuance of the rigid 90-per-cent-ofparity system of price supports . Secretary Benson originally had recommended that the flexibility range between 75 and 90 per cent . Senator George D. Aiken ( R ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an **26;508;TOOLONG rate . But as the vote neared , some senators wavered , so the final vote came on a further compromise with 821 per cent set as the floor for supports . The compromise amendment was introduced by Senator Andrew F. Schoeppel ( R ) of Kansas . Characteristically opposing the administration , Senator Joseph R. McCarthy ( R ) of Wisconsin proposed a different amendment requiring even higher supports than at present , ranging from 90 to 100 per cent of parity . This was rejected overwhelmingly . In the administration 's second victory , the Senate , by a vote . of 49 to 43 , defeated a drive by farm state senators . to lift the level of supports on butter , cheese , and dried milk from the 75 per cent of parity figure set by Secretary Benson last year to 85 per cent .

Senator Anderson said " a few hours " of debate should be sufficient to underline what opponents believe to be the " **27;536;TOOLONG " Ma. tures of the atomic energy bill .
