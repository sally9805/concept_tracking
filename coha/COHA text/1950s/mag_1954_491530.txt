The Party is Over for the Eskimos By SALL CARBIGHAR Eskimo workers in Barrow , Alaska , were averaging $140 a week . Then , one day last spring , the Navy project was called oft Electricity and fuel for their new ' houses became luxuries . But how do they go hack to snow huts after a taste of civilization ? BARROW , ALASKA . T HEN you will be able lo live . " When I mid it , I was not trying to reassure Samuel Simmons , the young Eskimo who had been telling me of his people 's plena . I was ex ? pressing my Etat isfact ion at hearing once more of the Eskimos ' primitive ways of surviving . Whet theydid formerly they condo now , I thought ? with relief that was premature . For nine years . during the Navy 's exploration for oil on the arctic coast , the natives at Barrow have had their first chance to earn white wages ; they have been able , at last , to buy things that ill civilized people consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suddenness of a Navy nn.nouncement , however , the Navy project is being suspended . The income of the whole settlement has abruptly stopped . In Boston , reading that this would happen . I was alarmed for the welfare of Eskimo friends and made the trip hack to this farthest-north tip of Alaska in order to see for myself what their future will he . I started by talking to Samuel , assistant to Ed Burnell , the white fuel dealer , for aL Barrow the quest ion of heat IN Ili least as pressing as hunger . There , in July , the polar ice pick still nudged the beach ; eleven Navy ships , come to remove equipment , had been blocked by the ice farther south , near the Sea Horse Islands . Yet less than 100 yards from that most remote arctic shore I found Samuel in an orderly office , businesslike in his setting of modern oil stove , electric steel filing cabinets and lete  --  model typewriter . Samuel is tall for an Eskimo , perhaps live feet ten , with a pleareintly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve that seem Oriental . I told him that I had come to learn what is ahead for his neighbors , and he explained how the wildlife economy formerly worked at Barrow . But then , when I showed that I thought their problems could all be solved , Samuel , in a reproachful tone , said , " It is not enough for us now to be fed and warm . We have known modern living . " And will they , in fact , all be fed and warm ? I soon found Hutt their ancient and perilous ways of surviving have become even more uncertain because of some side effects of the Navy project . The Eskimos on the coast of the Arctic Ocean were scattered in earlier days , in a few cabins here and there , in sonic cases a hundred miles apart , distributed widely enough so that the wildlife resources . the SATURDiN EVENING POST February 20 , nu of the project . The final notice that operations would be suspended was made on March 6 , 1953 . The Eskimos read of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane . During the height of the operations , 125 Eskimo men were employed at wages that averaged $1.10 a week . A few families with grown sons have had two or three times that amount to spend . These were a race with hide experience in the handling of money , but they learned quickly that wages would buy a new life for them . Steve Hopaon , a half-breed , built a theater ; later the Native Store , a co-operative . put up another . Each theater shows a different new picture , flown from Hollywood , every night . Entire families have been going , some attending the first show at one theater and the second show at the other . Few of thei ; e Eskimos ever have left their primitive icebound coast , few even have been to Fairbanks , but now they have seen electrified kitchens , living rooms made luxurious with upholstered furniture , rugs , draperies , Venetian blinds ; and beds  --  no white people , they found , sleep on caribou skins . To someext en I I hey were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the Barrow homes of the teachers and trailers and missionaries . But now I hey have ranged the world . They have watched fictinnal murders , which many of them believe to have really happened , and vicariously they have attended smart cocktail parties . Their minds have become a confusion  --  which 111Utit 1112 extremely uncomfortable ? of sophisticated and aboriginal points of view . For a white person its an amazing experience to sit in an Eskimo audience . 1111 of them drinking pop , as they eagerly seek more hints as In white men 's ways . The music of jazz hands moans out of the theater doors and over the limitless , silent ice pack . After t he show , chairs are cleared away 111111 t he young people jitterbug . Met it-order catalogues quickly arrived to transform the new wishes into realities . The postmaster keeps his record of money orders in n long ledger . For the entire year of 1942 there was only in page and a half of entries ; in 1940 the listing required lifty-live pages . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color , it must have seemed that they could have everything they desired . With the encouragement of the Alaska Native Service , a branch of the Bureau of Indian Affairs , they were building new houses . After these homes were furnished for civilized living , and after the families were dressed all in Stateside clothes , they still had money . One man bought himself six expensive watches . They have become photographers . A Navy official , in town for the Nollantrole , the celebration after the whaling season , was ashamed , he told me , to bring out his small camera when he was surrounded by Eskimos shooting the scene in color with movie equipment . Several families sent for TV sets , ' though the nearest station was more than 500 unites away and only in the planning singe . The Eskimos st ill wear their parkas for warmth out of doors . Under the parkas , men , women and children dress like Americans anywhere . The girls are truly smart in their wool skirts and sweaters and little silk scarfs ; their black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent - waved , The Eskimos are not so plump as they look when photographed in their parkas , and today most of the Barrow woinen are dieting . These natives have learned , too , the ways to make life more easy . It is the Eskimo custom to drive to the edge of the sea ice by dog sled and fish . All the men still love fishing , but one charters a bush plane to take him out . Or he recently did ; now he wonders how soon he can reassemble a learn of dogs . Their changed life has meant more Than comfort : a modernized outlook and a different kind of self-confidence . That was made clear as I talked to Ned Nusunginya . He ire one of the older men and is famous throughout the arctic because he carried the mail between Barrow and Kotzebue , the most hazardous route , more than 500 miles by dog team , for nineteen years . Ned is of medium height , lean , with skin taut and polished over his facial muscles . Lately he has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a profitable experience , working with Stateside lnborers : " Fine men , A few were not good . but remember there are bad Eskimos too . " As we talked of the hardships during his years on the trail , we were in his new house , which is warmed by an oil heater ? his wife 's modern enamel cook-stove operates on propane gas  --  a house where it seems normal to find electric lights and a washing machine , a davenport , portieres ; on the tables The Saturday Evening Post , The National Geographic Magazine and the Fairbanks News-Miner . One of the finest radios I have ever heard was bringing in symphony music , rebroadcast by the Navy transmitter . Everywhere that one looked there were comforts that will require a cash income for maintenance . And soon there would be no income . Ned can not even go back on the trail , for planes now carry the His lit this grit ndann came in. a ruddy-checked cherub in It blue snow suit trimmed with yellow ducks . Ned looked at the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eskimo baby , " he said . meaning he would have been riding his mother 's back in the hood of her parka . Ned , with affectionate pride , added , " Now he is like children everywhere . " To be like people everywhere has become nearly as important in Barrow as to he warm and to know that one 's next meal is sure . There will be less readjustment concerning meals than most other things nit Barrow . When I found Ned in his well-equipped home , he was dressed in slacks and a wool sport shirt ; he could hardly , even in featUres , have been distinguished from a labor foreman in the States , except that he was eating the lest bites from in plate of whale meat . On the table was only that  --  pieces of raw whale cut through the black skin  --  which I myself find delicious  --  and on into the gristly blubber . In size and shape the pieces were similar to watermelon plugs , and Ned ate them the same way , in his fingers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whale meat furnished the dinner . The Eskimos prefer their own foods when those are available , and the summer of 1953 had produced some of the best hunting in local history  --  eighteen whales , and the record is nineteen . Walrus , too , had been plentiful , also seals and caribou . In June there had been a lemming migra- tion , and in " lemming years " other // animals are apt to reach a peak  --  no one knows why . The men who worked at the Navy haw had been buying the natural foods from the others , the hunter ' ' , thus spreading the Navy wages . They paid wall ? $1.50 n pound for the mukluk ? the black whale skin . Neverthehiet few civilized foods to supplement these bsve become almost necessities to the Barrow Eskimos . They want milk for the children , ( lour for pancakes , and canned fruits . They will mien some of our delicacies , which they have been quick to appreciate . On the shelves of the Native Store I saw canned blue-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a loaf . But even better than these , to the natives ' taste , are whale , seal and earlbOu meat , fish and waterfowl . With the freight rate on air-borne foods twenty cents a pound beyond Fairbanks , the prices of Stateside products were very high . To get an estimate of a typical homily 's food budget I called on Lee Suvlu , the Eskimo .. manager of the Native Store . He is a large and impassive fellow , intelligent but unsmiling behind his huge desk He said that the store grossed $300,000 last year , and that an average family spent at least $300 a month for food . When I asked him about next year , he replied by shifting his shoulders . None of the six other stores is as large as the Native Store , but all offer general merchandise . I noted one woman 's order : 3 coos of blueberries 2 Ca 71-4. of fruit salad 6 small pbc butes of atke 3 rolls of toilet paper I lb of butter The bill was $12.75 . None of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . But the woman would soon not have money enough to buy them . Hunger is intermittently II most urgent problem at Barrow . The fearful cold , however , the danger of actually freezing to death , must be coped with continuously through more than half of each year . Therefore most discussions of the present emergency start with the recently built houses : are they practical ? Will they be warm ? The houses are more than shelters . They have resulted in better health , greater cleanliness , a degree of privacy never known by the natives before . But the homes must also CIO something that we in Stateside communities take for granted ? they must save the occupants ' lives . In the arctic , winter weather is lethal . The Barrow Eskimos never lived in ice igloos . At one lime the men hunting caribou would build little snow huts in which to camp , but for many years Lents have been carried along on the dog sleds . The houses in town were of timber ; earlier they had whalebone supports . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheathed to the roof line with earth and sod blocks . The resulting shape was a mound that was covered with snow in the winter . Earth and sod are excellent insulation ; so is snow . Scientists in the arctic find that snow less than three feet deep may maintain a temperature at ground level as high as twenty-one degrees F. when the air above is more than seventy degrees colder . It is no mammoth problem to heat a house surrounded by a temperature or twenty-one degrees above zero under its roof of snow . The blubber lamps kept the interior of the houses even warmer than white people like . Ezra Ekalook is still living in one of the old sod houses , and he let me go through it . From the outside it appears that a stovepipe is sticking up through a hillock of grass . But n low door leads into one side , to a short entrance passage that opens into Iwo rooms , one perhaps ten feet by twelve , the other room six by eight . The inner floor , walls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linoleum on the floor . The window in the main room is in the roof , and inasmuch as it faces the sky , all the sunshine is caught all day during the summer . The owners , incidentally , have a washing machine . Any household tucked into such quarters would obviously be crowded  --  undesirable everywhere , but especially in the north , for there is scarcely an Eskimo family that has n't an active case of tuberculosis among its members . Hospital beds are so few that up to the present time there has been it delay of about two years before It patient could he admitted . While hi ' waits , if he can hold out that long , he lives with his family , rind in a house of but one or two rooms everyone else will certainly be exposed to contagion . When the new Barrow houses were going to he built , it was therefore important that they should be somewhat larger  --  that is , they should have included more rooms . The rooms still could have been smell and the houeee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have proved beat in that climate  --  close to the ground and insulated with earth and sod blocks and snow . However , the natives rind their advisers among the white men saw in the high Navy wages a chance to provide modern civilized housing up on that arctic coast . Except for its layout of streets , Barrow today looks like a suburb of Boston . But where is the bank ? Where are the huse nese enterprises in which owners of houses like these could earn their up-keep ? There is a kind of town square ' , rimmed by the school , hospital , church and parsonage . The fourth side of the square is the shore of the frozen Pell facing toward the North Pole . Near the open area are the telegraph station , run by the Army Signal Corps. the post office , air-line office  --  a Quonset hut  --  the coal hunker and several little stores without show windows . The houses are grouped in two sections . " Browerville , " to the west , is occupied by the families of Charles Brower'e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other , the older town , scatters out from the square . Nature decided where the original boutees were placed , often on frost mounds or in them . An the old tette , were used for the new lionnal , they are set here , there , anywhere , and connected by wander-mg lanes . The effect is casual , rather charming . The Eskimo men themselves put op the modern houses , and the pleasing proportions are an evidence of the builders ' innate good taste . No two are alike . A fair number are two stories high . An average house will have three or four rooms ; at least one has eight . The rooms are of generous size . They have eight-foot ceilings , the reason apparently being that moat of the inner walls have been faced with plywood supplied in sheets eight feet long . The outer walls are of composition or wooden aiding , though some of the houses are shingled . Most are painted ; the others are weathering , not unattractively . A visitor who is also a northerner will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house harder to heat ; and so many certainly are not needed , For most of the Eskimos spend the summer months out of doors , at fish and duck camps , and in winter , night lasts around the clock . In the Stites we associate windows , and therefore light , with health , but the distribution of sunshine throughout the year is simply one of the ways in which living conditions at Barrow are vastly different . The houses are resting on frozen ' oil ; therefore none has a basement or , of course , central heating . Most of the outer and inner walls have been nailed onto two-inch studding , with commercial insulating material filling the spaces between . To hear the Eskimos spmk of the insulation , one would think it a miracle product , for here it is , the fluffiest sort of stuff , and yet the advertisements say it will keep a house cozy ! Yes , a house in Ohio , where a thermometer reading of ten above zero makes it a very cold day . But the Barrow homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , hills or other protection . in temperatures of fifty degrees below zero at times , and the winds may blow at 100 miles an hour from over the polar ice pack . Arcot Castel , a respected trader with almost a lifetime of experience in the country , told me his house at Barrow had walls composed of three layers of wood , interspaced with heavy tar paper , and with an outside covering of corrugated iron ; and the inside well of that house on the northern , windward side , behind the stove , would be coated with ice all winter . At Ieast two stoves are required to heat most of Barrow 's new houses . With oil priced at thirty dollars a drum . sometirma more , and with a stove burning five gallons a day , each oil stove costs ninety dollars a month to run . Coal is a little cheaper , but it is poor coal ; one can not bank a fire through the night with it . It sells for forty-two dollars a ton arid , according to Samuel Simmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be needed to keep a house warm . The coal comes from a " hallow mine about seventy-five miles away at Meade River . The mine was developed by the Alaska Native Service and is operated under contract with that agency by Ed Burnell . He brings in the coal to Barrow by tractor . He else supplies electricity for the homes , with a thirty-kilowatt A.C. Diesel generator . A family with two or three light bulbs and a few appliances pays a flat rate of twenty-five dollars a month . No one liken to think of a Lime when the current would be turned off , but under a wildlife economy , twenty-five , dollars may be a family 's total income for a month or much longer . In far Bronller houses , blubber lamps would have furnished both heat and light , and would have cost nothing . Sinks were installed in some of the houses , though no water will over flow out of the beautiful chromium faucets , and drainpipes can not be laid in the frozen ground . In one of the Barrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands by dipping a pan of water out of the melted ice in a barrel , carried the water to a washbasin set in a luxurious levatory , later emptied the water into the lavatory , from which it run into a bucket , to be carried outside and poured onto the ground . The washbasin could just as well have been set on n shelf . The plumbing only wasted the natives ' money . A truly alarming mistake was that of allowing Kane of the Eskimos to construct wooden chimneys . In the house where I was quartered , the oil heater feeds into a chimney made of wood ? now , of course , very dry . Oil stoves . 4111 we know at Nome , invariably soot up their chimneys and almoot as inevitably the soot at some time catches tire . In Nome , metal stacks from the stove are enclosed in larger metal sleeves to reduce the danger . For everywhere in the north , fire is thought of with special horror . With all water frozen for much of the year . it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gales one burning house can mean the destruction of an entire town in hours . If the temperature should be fifty below zero that day , bow would the people fare after their homes were gone ? One man at Barrow is tearing his house down , reducing it to a single room . Others are moving out into the old too-crowded huts . Still others are trying to build superstructures of snow blocks around the new homes , but the larger ones  --  those at least that are two stories high  --  can not be cased in snow , and unless a house contains all of its heat , the snow melts away from the outer walla The housing on St. Lawrence Island may indicate what will happen at Barrow . The island Eskimos , too , were encouraged to put up frame houses during a time when a high price for fox pelt , ' had increased their prosperity . As soon as the price came down , the islanders found 1 hat they could not afford to heat the while men 's kind of dwellings , not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the problem 's final solution , most island families live in their civilized houses only in summer , between trips to camps . Even then , fires are needed , and it is told that one old woman , for warmth , pitched a tent on her living-room floor . Although the outcome of the St. Lawrence situation was known intimately to the Alaska Native Service , that egeneyeponsored the housing project at Barrow . The ANS appears to see its own function as furnishing a protective guidance for Alaskan Eskimos , Indians and Aleuts ; for decades ; it has duplicated the territorial departments of Health , Welfare and Education , administering these services to the natives , and it has supervised the efforts to establish reindeer herds . At Barrow , the ANS runs the school and hospital ; it controls the coal mine and concerns itself with the co-operative Native Store . The school principal is the ANS representative . He has many duties , from authorizing the store 's requisitions to sitting in on the Eskimo Council meetings . His influence 18. of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program was initiated end carried out , the project lasting through the regimes of two principals . The lest one states that it was the ANS policy not to restrict the Eskimos in their choice of architecture . He did , however , he imp , insist that they buy good materials . If he could do that , he could have insisted on a good ? which is to say , practical ? type of construction . He knew , as everyone did , that the future of the Navy 's explorat ions was doubtful ; he knew there was nothing sure about the Eskimos ' incomes . He also knew what it costs in the north to maintain a frame building . The ANS provides all its teachers with conventional stateside housing , and the teachers order the fuel . A few years ago the district supervisor in Nurne told me the ANS pays an average of $125 a month for heel , lights end wilier in one teacher 's house . That house is comparable in size to the natives ' houses at Barrow . but is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triple-insulated and in every way built as tight as 11 stateside contractor could make it . No one could hope that the Eskimos ' houses would not cost more to run . The ANS pays for the upkeep of the teachers homes , but no such subsidy has been proposed for the Eskimo families . It seems , therefore , en incredible lack of judgment to let the natives build houses so wholly unsuited to people without dependable income " ? to aid them in doing it . since the ANS was the sponsor . And yet even today the ANS is defending the Barrow housing . if judgment was lacking in the overall plan , the financial arrangements between the ANS and the natives were canny . Some of the Eskimos built the houses in one operation ; some a room every summer . In either case , during the winter the natives , in consultation with the ANS principal , decided what materials they would need . Payments started at once . The ANS procured the materials through t heir Seattle buying organization and Ihey came up the nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully paid for . Commercial freighters do n't go to Barrow . The North Star , a ship owned by the ANS , makes the trip once every mummer , unless ice condition ' prevent . It delivered the building materials , and in the beginning so also did some of the Navy ships when they brought up supplies to the base . The materials in both cases were carried freight-free . The Navy was in no way responsible for mistakes in the housing project , however . It is true that the natives wanted the houses they built , and they have been criticized for foolish choices . Those who worked at the base quickly learned civilized skills , such as carpentering and operating heavy equipment ; as good mechanics , why did n't they realize that modern homes would require an immense amount of expensive heat in their country ? They did have new skills ; they did not have experience . They had never owned houses like these before . They had never installed insulation . They had seen pictures of civilized houses in movers and milgazinme and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no one explained that down in the States activity almost conies to a standstill , while people hover around their radiators , on winter days that an Eskimo would call warm . The natives had known that similar houses are built and occupied by the white people at Barrow  --  the teachers and staffs at the hospital , weather bureau , CCA . Army Signal Corps and mission ; also the trnders . The Eskimos had no way , however , to estimate what the white men were paying for heat . The maintenance of a house in terms of colds outgo is not in an Eskimo 's background ; it is not in his understanding . If the Barrow natives did stop to question the future expense , their great longing to be like people everywhere must have hurried them into the wrong decision , They have known u gap between their own comfort and I hat of white neighbors that hue no equivalent in the States . Until lately , relying upon a wildlife economy , they could not afford even necessities of a civilized life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet they have gone into the while people 's quarters , have walked on the sumptuous carpets , eat in the overstuffed chains , admired the floor lamps , the vacuum cleaners , the washing machined , and especially perhaps the space , the warm airiness under ceilings amazingly high . Their arctic may be unique , but Eskimos are themselves like the rest of us in their wishes . The dream has been handed along for a century , since the first white men apiwared , that someday they , too , might live as the white men do . The Navy project gave them that chance 111 Imo . They took it and found that they liked their new luau-rim quite as much as they had ex-peeled . Then the dream ended . What lies ahead for them ? I have been netting that question of Eskimos and of white observers , teachers , traders and Navy men . Some of the white men 's replies have shown real concern ; some have been glib ; " They 'll get along . They 'll go back to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SATU RIMY EVENING Filfirunr:i 211 , Ifni they know their most premising nesdafuel and at least partial incomes in cash . There will be oil for the blubber lamps in the years when wildlife is plentiful , and driftwood in small amounts will wash up on the beach . A fair stock of ii has collected during this time when the natives bought coal and nil , but without trees on the arctic slope , there is no driftwood except that which comes more than 500 miles from the Mackenzie River , in Caneda . It takes a long time to reach Barrow , with the sea open only a few weeks in summer . The pipe line from a Navy gas well lo the base runs within two miles of the village , and the Eskimos wander why they ca n't have the output now . They told me that a committee of ANS officials recently came to Barrow , and when the villagers asked them about the gas , they were told that the ANS wants the town to continue the use of coal in order to Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamlet of sixty people . Nobody suggested where the money will come from to pay for the coal . I myself asked Navy Cmdr. Ralph C. Jensen , in charge of the arctic construction , aixsul the gas . Speaking unofficially , he explained that gas wells and pipe lines require skillful handling in the far north . Ice crystals may block the lines , and heaving by frost may break them . In other words , certain difficulties would have to be overcome , as the Navy was able to do , by any organization arranging to furnish Barrow with gas . One hears that the supply could he augmented , to some extent , by sinking another well near the first , at n rumored cost of about $30,000 . No agency has come forward with undo , though the ANS hoe spent more than eight limes that amount in the lust year on a handsome new Barrow school . I t is also protested that some of the gas he used to create a supply of electric power for the town . The Rural Electrification Administration is investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well open for the duration of the study and an appeal was made to the Bureau of Indian Affairs . But that agency declined to associate itself with the undertaking . At the last moment the Navy , out of a sense of gratitude to 11w native workmen , assumed the expense . The Navy , and the civilian contractors who conducted the oil explorations , have all along been concerned for the Eskimos ' welfare . Neither the Navy nor the imported civilian personnel were allowed in gel nut of hand , and on an informal basic much was done for the settlement Does the Navy owe anything more to the Eskimos ? No one implies that an unpromising project should be continued , but the fact r  --  f:mine that the natives ' whole way of life has been dislocated . The question is asked : Is there not other work that these people could do for the military ? Eskimo women at Nome made the clothing taken by Admire ! Byrd on one of his antarctic expeditions , Perhaps a small factory established at Harrow could supply some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least by the Eskimos in the Alaska National Guard . Other equipment required by the armed forces for far-northern operations might be made by the Barrow men . The only cash products in the wildlife economy , as it is at Barrow , are polar-bear skins and white-lux pelts . In the last exceptionally good year , bearskins brought the village about $1000 and fox pelts ten times us much . With the population of Barrow 1100 , that is a monthly income of less than five dollars per family . Unemployment insurance is cushioning the transition , and other Government benefits help . The suspended Navy base will employ four or five watchmen . A similar number have jobs et the Native Store , school end hospital , and seven girls work as nurse 's aides The Eskimo men who serve  --  proudly and well  --  in the Alaska National Guard will each earn the Army 's base pay for forty-eight days per year . But all these sources of income will not heat the houses . They will help to buy incidentals as important to Eskimos as to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Segevan , a thoughtful old Eskimo with a high-domed head , what is the beet thing that white people have brought to Barrow . He answered without hesitation , " Cigarettes . After cigarettes , coffee . " Other necessities would be soap , toilet paper , stockings , toothbrushes , a dozen more items perhaps ; and the money the natives will have will not buy ninny such things , in addition to ammunition for hunters ' guns and gasoline at eighty cents a gallon for the engines of whet , ing boats . As the Barrow men have learned trades , they might move to Fairleinka A few families have , and most have come back . They are not , happy in and no friend of these Invable people wishes to gee them there , for Eskimos are like Indians in their susceptibility to the white mane vices . Will they return to their hunting economy ? To an extent ; but many seem spoiled for that too . It is a hu . ardour life . In October , 1952 , eleven men , in four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that coast . Last July there were seals in the ice  --  I saw five on the beach at one time  --  and yet most of the men wore not hunting , They had not lost their skill during the years at the base , but they had lost the wish to secure their living in such a precarious way . Eskimos always have had to wail for prosperity ; they could not force it . Nothing that they could do would make the whales , fish and ducks arrive any sooner or any more driftwood float up on the shore . Beyond the outwitting of animals and beyond finding the means to survive in the arctic cold , initiative was of no use to the Eskimos ; therefore they never developed much of it . it will be logical , almost the only poesible thing , if the Eskimos wait , now , for us to teach them a different approach to a livelihood . And with our initiative it will he logical , and humane es well , if we set up a program to do t hat ..
