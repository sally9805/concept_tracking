AMERIGO AND THE NEW WORLD ( 323 pp. ) - Germn Arciniegas-Knopf ( $5 ) . <P> Everyone knows that Christopher Columbus discovered America , but did he really ? A Colombian diplomat and historian , Germn Arciniegas does not ask the question in his Amerigo and the New World , but the reader is bound to . Columbus boldly sailed through the curtain of fear and superstition that had kept men from trying the dread Atlantic crossing . But he died believing that he had reached Asia , never accepted the fact that the New World was really another continental land mass . The first man to name it the New World was the Florentine navigator and businessman Amerigo Vespucci ; at least , according to Author Arciniegas , he also reached the mainland before Columbus. * Arciniegas has given him one of his few book-length biographies five centuries after his birth . <P> Clearing the Name . The names of Amerigo 's contemporaries in Florence read like a glory roll : Lorenzo de ' Medici , Domenico Ghirlandaio , Leonardo da Vinci . Good Florentine that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and ideas with the art of business . While he was in Seville , Spain , as an agent for Florentine interests , he came to know Columbus and King Ferdinand , who gave him the chance to go on voyages that resulted in the first useful maps of the New World 's continental coastline . <P> Columbus had been given the proud title of Admiral of the Ocean Sea , but his rewards could more accurately be measured in abuse than in wealth or glory . Amerigo was made Pilot Major by King Ferdinand for all of Spain , and no captain could sail without the certificate that Amerigo alone could issue . His voyages may have been as epochal as Author Arciniegas says they were , but for centuries one school of historians has held that he chivvied his friend Columbus out of his due . Even Ralph Waldo Emerson found it " strange . . . that broad America must wear the name of a thief . " <P> A Name Stuck . The plodding research that has gone into Amerigo may help clear its hero 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the publisher 's blurb : " What sort of man was Amerigo Vespucci ? " So little is known for sure about him that it could easily fit into a tightly written essay . Author Arciniegas pads out his book with heavily-written filler about Florence and Spain , never comes close to presenting a talking , walking Amerigo . <P> During World War II , a retreating German unit dynamited the town of St. Di , in Lorraine . One of the buildings blown up had worn a plaque which told of something that few Americans , North or South , know about . It was there , on April 25 , 1507 , that a group of scholars and poets ran off on their press a book named Cosmographiae Introductio . In it , for the first time , appeared the name of America . Wrote the author in Latin : " I see no reason why we should not call it America , that is to say , land of Americus , for Americus its discoverer , man of sagacious wit . . . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus discovered Cuba , Puerto Rico , Jamaica , etc . Only on his third voyage ( 1498 ) did he reach the mainland . Author Arciniegas claims that Amerigo actually reached the continent the year before . From the meager evidence ( mainly letters ) , other scholars doubt this , believe that Amerigo followed Columbus by a year .
