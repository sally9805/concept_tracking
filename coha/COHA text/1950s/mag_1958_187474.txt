An actress strolled into a CBS television studio in Manhattan last week , eyed a motley crew of amateur technicians assembled for rehearsal of her daytime serial . " Which one of you , " she asked facetiously , " is Mr. Paley ? " CBS 's Board Chairman William S. Paley was not there to lend a hand with the show , but he might have been . In eight cities across the U.S. where CBS owns TV and radio stations , some 1,300 members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O . International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers had walked out , abandoning cameras , microphone booms , control panels and projectors . Quipped a studio wag : " CBS now means the Confused Broadcasting System ! " <P> Bloopers &; Booms . But as the week wore on , there was only slight confusion . Months earlier , CBS 's Manhattan headquarters had held quickie training courses for about 300 executive-level staffers . As soon as the I.B.E.W. men left their posts , their amateur replacements poured into the breach . In Los Angeles , CBS Radio 's vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer on a radio drama ; in Manhattan , William B. Lodge , another v.p. , assisted at the network 's master control board . Publicity men , time salesmen , casting directors and accountants leaped to unaccustomed tasks , in some cases worked 17-hour days . <P> Many programs predictably muddled through bloopers born of the green crews ' clumsiness and uncertainty . Boom dollies were knocked over ; commercials and credits were run twice , or upside down , or not at all ; sound faded away or leaked sudden bursts of studio chatter and laughter . A few shows , regularly broadcast live , were replaced by film substitutes . But most programs-and the strike-rolled on as scheduled . <P> Tape &; Technicians . The strikers professed to be uninterested in CBS 's offer of a $185.50 weekly minimum wage unless it was accompanied by a tighter job-security clause in their new contract . But behind the talk of security was a looming new threat to their jobs : video tape , the electronic wonder that can record both TV 's sounds and images on a magnetized plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can reproduce what it has heard and seen-a second or a century later ( TIME , Feb. 4 , 1957 ) . The reproduced image on the TV screen is far superior to film , and distinguishable from live shows only by experts . <P> The union 's fear is that video taping will largely replace live broadcasting from studios and the I.B.E.W. crews that such broadcasts employ . They further worry that the taping will be taken over by outside companies that do not employ I.B.E.W. technicians . Negotiators for CBS and the union began wrangling in Washington at week 's end , with a federal mediator on hand to keep them tuned in to each other .
