When Mamie Eisenhower called her first White House press conference last week , Washington 's newshens , elegantly hatted and with pencils poised , flocked to the White House radio-TV room ( once part of the kitchen ) for the big event . Mamie invited the male correspondents , too , and though they outnumbered the ladies , the men hung shyly back , asked only one question : How was the White House food ? Fine , said Mamie . <P> The First Lady looked radiant and chic in a grey suit , handled herself with aplomb . After the picture-taking , she flashed a big smile at the ladies , sat down at a desk and said " Good morning . " " Good morning , teacher , " burbled the New York Times 's Bess Furman . " That 's just what I feel like , " said Mamie . Then , as if she had done it a thousand times before , she reached for her engagement list and read it off , tea by inexorable tea . Among the coming events : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " I think it 'll be a lot of fun " ) . <P> News of Upstairs . Then Mamie was ready for questions . While pencils flashed like knitting needles , Mamie let the girls in on some of the upstairs news .

Mamie usually stays up until 10:30 or 11 , alone or with her mother , watching television . <P> News from the Zoo . After the conference , the First Lady hurried upstairs where some special house guests were waiting : her three grandchildren , who had arrived with their mother , Mrs. John Eisenhower , the evening before . Young Dwight David Eisenhower II , who will celebrate his fifth birthday this month , Barbara Anne , 3 , and Baby Susan Elaine , 1 , were paying their first visit to grandfather 's new house . One fine afternoon they played on the back lawn under the budding magnolias . When the photographers arrived , David obligingly lifted Skunky , the family 's portly Scotty , for a moment , but had to give it up . " She 's too fat , " he puffed . Then he and curly-headed Barbara Anne peddled their tricycles over a stretch of grass made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
