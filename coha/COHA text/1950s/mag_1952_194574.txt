" Americans do n't have the guts to be bullfighters . " This remark , tossed off in a Mexico City caf , infuriated a young poster artist with flaming red hair and a temper to match . He flared back : " Americans have more guts in their little fingers than the rest of the world put together ! " To make good his boast , Brooklyn-born Sidney Franklin had to learn enough about bullfight technique to get through a face-saving appearance with yearling bulls at a rancho in the country . That was back in 1922 , and with time off for wars , revolutions and surgical operations , Franklin , the only American ever to become a topflight matador , has been in or around bull rings ever since . <P> Tedious , backbreaking cape and sword lessons with Rodolfo Gaona , " Mexico 's best and one of the three greatest matadors* of all time , " taught Franklin that bullfighting was grinding work . He learned to respect the brave bulls , too . " But what enthralled me most , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the crowd held the fighters . " Extroverted , extravagant , foolish and flamboyant , Franklin surf boarded through the ' 20s on this idolatrous wave , bathing himself in a thunderous surf of resounding Ols . <P> " Cold Valor . " Franklin hobnobbed with royalty and other big-name people - Mary Garden , Fritz Kreisler , Pablo Casals , Douglas Fairbanks Sr. At another extreme , he once engaged in a memorable ten-day spree with a tribe of back-jungle Mexican Indians who were fascinated by his red hair , and took steps to see that the next batch of children all had it . <P> As a reporter for the North American News Alliance , he covered the Spanish Civil War with his good friend Ernest Hemingway , who wrote , in 1932 , in Death in the Afternoon : " Franklin is brave with a cold , serene and intelligent valor . . . He is one of the most skillful , graceful , and slow manipulators of cape fighting today . . . No history of bullfighting that is ever written can be complete unless it gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last week , characteristically sparing no superlatives , Franklin published his autobiography* for armchair aficionados . And , characteristically , Franklin was far away from the literary tea set . He was in Spain making his debut as a teacher of young bullfighters , in the small ( pop . 18,000 ) Andalusian city of Alcal de Guadaira , eight miles from the famed bullfight center of Seville . Franklin had patched up the local bull ring , unused for 25 years , with $6,000 of his own money to provide an arena for his school . <P> Warm Reception . Now 49 , his body scarred by repeated gorings and 20-odd corrective operations , Franklin knows that his career as a top matador is finished . But like all good fighters , he hates to call it quits . His first practice corrida at Alcal was quite a comedown for a matador once the toast of two continents , but Franklin did not seem to mind . In fact , he was delighted with his pupils , even though some of them reacted to the tension of their first appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
