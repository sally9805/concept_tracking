According to the French , " BB " - short for Brigitte Bardot-is going to replace MM as a symbol of sex . Brown-haired Brigitte , 23 , is slender but softly rounded . From the neck up , though , she looks about twelve years old , and bears a striking resemblance to Shirley Temple at that age . Her movies have smashed attendance records from Norway to the Middle East , and Hollywood has bid high for her services . So far . Brigitte has preferred Paris , where she gets about 30 million francs ( more than $70,000 ) for every picture . <P> Last week , with La Bardot 's most notorious film doing record business in Manhattan , and another set to open soon , U.S. moviegoers had a chance to see what all the European excitement is about . It adds up to a brouhaha in a bias cup . <P> And God Created Woman ( Kingsley International ) opens with a shot that promises a good deal more than the picture delivers . There lies Brigitte , stretched from end to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a censor 's eyeball . In the hard sun of the Riviera her round little rear glows like a peach , and the camera lingers on the subject as if waiting for it to ripen . Pretty soon an aging lecher ( Curt Jurgens ) appears , and the two converse with only a sheet between them . <P> After a lot of dull plot and duller dialogue ( Brigitte : " I 've got a flat . " Man helping her with her bike : " I 'd never have suspected " ) , the hero ( Christian Marquand ) refuses to marry the girl , so she takes his brother ( Jean-Louis Trintignant ) instead . She does her best to make her husband 's brother jealous , and the moviegoer curious-here comes that sheet again . She wraps it around her so that the husband can see what 's inside and the audience ca n't . But by this time , the spectator , if he happens to be grownup , may not be looking anyway . If sex is the object , there is just about as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in promulgating Brigitte as a full-blown enchantress , the French have clearly sent a girl to do a woman 's job . <P> Please ! Mr. Balzac ( DCA ) offers Brigitte in a part appropriately cut to her girlish measure , but in a picture that ought to be cut in half . Brigitte is cast as a girl of good provincial family , who has secretly written a bestselling novel-a fact which so horrifies her father that he ships her off to a convent . Wrong train , of course , and Brigitte winds up in Paris in the company of two young journalists ( Daniel Gelin and Robert Hirsch ) who have no money but plenty of notions . Brigitte soon gets one of her own , and enters a striptease contest to get rich quick . It turns out to be slow work , though , especially for the audience . Most of the time the journalists seem to be doing a class-day imitation of Martin and Lewis , and though Brigitte undresses charmingly , she 's just a bit too sisterly about it . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language she speaks can be understood without subtitles .
