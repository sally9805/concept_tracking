Birth control was unanimously approved last week by the 95th annual convention of the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church ( 500,000 members ) , meeting in Los Angeles . Said the resolution : " An unrestrained production of children without realistic regard to God-given responsibilities involved in rearing children . . . may be as sinful and as selfish ... as is the complete avoidance of parenthood . . . The power to reproduce is His blessing , not a penalty , upon the sexual relationship in marriage . "
