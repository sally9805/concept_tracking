txt Letters to The Times Titoism in Peiping Queried Mao 's Theory of Contradictions Held No Indication of Rift With Moscow The writer of the following letter is Permanent Reprksentative of China to the United Nations . To THE EDITOR OFTHE NEW YORK TIMES : In the Khrushchev interview on C. B. S. and the subsequent discussions in the press and on radio and television in the United States during the past ten days I have been somewhat puzzled by the cdnsiderable attention given to Mao Tsetung 's theory of contradictions and Khrushchev 's assertion that such contradictions do not exist in the Soviet Union . Some commentators think that they have found a difference between Mao and Khrushchev , that this difference is of ideological im. iJortance and that it may be a sign of Titoism in Peiping . , Mao 's theory of contradictions between the leaders and the popular masses was advanced in a speech which he made before the so-called Supreme State Council on Feb. 27 of this year . It was further discussed by Mao in his speech of March 12 before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two speeches have not been published , but there has been considerable discussion in the Chinese Communist press . Party Organ Comment The most notable contribution Is a long editorial in the Jen Min Jih Pao of April 13 . As this paper is the Pravda ofthe Chinese Communists and as this editorial vas published when Mao 's speeches occupied the center of public discussion , we could safely assume that the editorial expressed Mao 's views accurately . The editorial began by explaining the . difference between conflicts of interest between " enemy . classes " and contradictions within the internal ranks of the . people . From this ' point on the editorial devoted itself to the idea of contradictions : " How do contradictions occur between the masses of the people and their leaders ? This is decided by the different positions they occupy in the life of the state . The masses of the people directly participate in production labor , principally physical labor , and generally find difficulty in exercising direct power of control . This situation they occupy makes it easier to observe questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , makes it easier for them to attach importance to current interests and local interests , but harder to understand the overall situation and over-all difficulties in socialist construction as a whole . On the other band , the leaders directly exercise control powers and generally find it difficult to participate in physical labor . They are in the better position to see long-range interests and over-all interests , and comparatively more easily neglect the concrete conditions and immediate demands of the masses of the people . " Jen Min Jih Pao indulged in much abstract talk . To put the whole matter in more concrete terms : the chief contradictions are the Communist policy of collectivization versus the peasants ' resistance to it and the Communist emphasis on heavy industry versus the people 's demand for consumers goods . Mao 's prescription to meet these contradictions consists of two items . First of all , he tells his followers that the Chinese Communist party should redouble its efforts in the ideological and political education of the people with the hope that they will appreciate the long-term anti over-all interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the leaders should cure themselves of bureaucratism . In fact there is being conducted on the mainland of China all energetic " rectification " campaign . The Chinese term used in this connection is " kuang -- laoism . " It connotes red tape , impatience with the peasants and the people in general , inadequate understanding of orders from above and oversolicitude for the physical comforts of life on the part of the bureaucrats . It should he noted that Mao 's " contradictions " expressly exclude tile idea of conflict of interest between classes . It should also be noted that Mao did not promise a change'of policy ; what he called for was better implementation . In effect , his speeches on the subject were pep talks for the campaign of rectification . I do not see anything of idedlogical importance in such a theory of contradictions . Khrushchev in his interview tried to brush it aside . When he was pinned down , he had to be very curt , as he felt that such a question deserved only a curt answer .

Eureka Spring* , Ark. , June 9,195V , Unifying the Armed Forcei Conflict Over Missiles Cited as Example of Waste Within Services The writer of the following letter has been a Teaching Fellow at tits Harvard Defense Studies Program . To TtIE EDITOR or TstsNigwYosx Tassels Secretary of Defense Wilson recently appeared before Congress to explain our $35 billion defense budg , et . In the course of events it became apparent that Congress , whether for political motives , or not , was beginning to question seriously tile management of our military affairs and now wants to reduce the budget . On this question of reducing the budget is the point made by Senator Symington , Congressman and others as to whether or not unie fication of the armed services Nvoulfe be beneficial to the nation snit whether or not . it would reduce en . penditures . Secretary Wilson said would not . Others say it . will . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1945 to 1950 , it is also true that since then tile forces have spent much of their time trying to convince Congress that their strategy and theirs alone will win another war . The competition of the services has gone to extremes , as evidenced by the hearings on the ** The result of that fracas was that air power was supposed to have won a victory because our large carriers were canceled . Carriers and Missiles Today one only has to read the front page of The New York Times to see that , not only do we have large carriers but that the Navy is trying hard to convince the President and others that it should receive the most money . This year one of the major conflicts will emerge over guided missiles . At present the competition between the services for appropriations and position is almost unbelievable . The amount of taxpayers ' money spent Ion public relations probably can not be counted . It seems to me that we must out of political necessity have the strongest military force in the world , capable of deterring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $35 billion defense budgets is not in sight . In fact , these budgets are expected to increase as we shift into the ballistic age . What we must do , it seems to me , is to keep our planning in pace with our technological developments and get the most for our money . When over $200 is spent each year for every man , woman and child in the United States , then there is an obligation to see to it that our military forces are rur. most efficiently and most economically . It is my belief that we can do a much better job . Econpnly Study A. complete study of the possibilities of unification should he undertaken to see whether or not this would net save billions of dollars a year . By unification I mean not abolishing the three services , but providing for one Chief of Staff and one supply corps . We can not go on year after year with the Army , Navy and Air Force each tFyin ? to convince Congress that its guided missile is the best . The present system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best . reasons for unification . At present the Army is attempting to produce a 1,500-mile missile , the Air Force a 3,00-mile missile and the Navy some other type . As a result the competition for scientists and engineers is wasteful . In an economy-minded Congress , ever aware of the need for a strong and well-staffed Army , Navy and Air Force , the case for unification should be as integral a part for consideration as the budget LAufteNcr .
