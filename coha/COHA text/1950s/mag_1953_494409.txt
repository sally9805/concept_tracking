NOVEMBER 2 , 1953 THERE NOW rages a controversy as to how fast and how comprehensively we should build our conti ? nental defenses against sudden attack , although the President of the United States has recently declared that the Russians now have the capability to launch such an attack and that their capabilities will rapidly increase . The experts with respect to continental defense may well have differences of opinion as to the most desirable nature of such defenses and as to the degree of their effectiveness at best . But the current confusion in the public mind on this subject does not stem primarily from this kind of disagreement among the experts . It stems rather from a widespread and false assumption that we can not afford large expansion of this type of defense without a sacrifice of sufficiency in the size and caliber of our deterrent striking forces . This fallacious assumption puts on opposite sides of the fence , and engages in bitter controversy , those experts who are concerned with deterrent striking forces and those experts who are concerned with continental defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? stances , there would be some hard-to-resolve differences between these two groups . But the current unmanageable and confusing and dangerous character of the current differences exists largely because both sides are following the false premise that our economy can not afford , or would be weakened by , the development of both types of defense in the amounts which all the experts in all fields would agree upon as the minimum safe necessity if they were not bedeviled by the economic nonsense that the United States can not afford to do what we must afford to do . Until this economic fallacy is revealed in all its stark nakedness and relegated to the oblivion which it deserves , there can never be anything but confusion on the subject of national defense in particular and economic policy in general in these perilous times . At its worst , the stubborn adherence to this dangerous Leon H. Keyserling , now a consulting economist and attorney , was Chairman of the President 's Council o Economic Advisers from 19561 to 1953 , and Vice Chair ? man from 1946 to 1950 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIO Conference on Taxation , October 16. economic fallacy is tied in with political commitments to reduce expenditures , to reduce taxes , and to balance the budget . Yet I can not for a moment believe that Presi ? dent Eisenhower would not discard these political com ? mitments with abandon , if the full truth were brought home to him that they rest upon an economic fallacy . Unhappily , the difficulty goes deeper than mere political commitments . The erroneous belief is sincerely held by many men that we must tailor our defense outlays , not to the true requirements of national security , but rather to the fancied requirements of an economy which is far stronger than they realize and which has a productive potential beyond the range of their vision . While these mistaken notions about the relationship between the na ? tional defense and the national economy existed in some parts of the past Administration as well as in some parts of the current Administration , there is less excuse for them now , because in mid-1950 there were only a few who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while today the few who foresaw it have been vindicated by actual develop ? ments . I emphasize this example only because we should all realize that arriving at the best attainable answer with respect to our national security policies , which can be done only in the context of sound economic thinking and sensible economic policies and programs , is infinitely the greatest problem confronting us as a nation . If we get the best possible answer in this matter , there can . be no doubt that the American economy despite some ups and downs will continue its timeless progress . But if we get the worst possible answer on this question , or even a poor answer , neither a prosperous economy nor lower taxes nor a balanced budget will avail us anything in the long run . Mindful of these considerations , I advance these propositions : 1 . Due to increases in national output since , the Korean outbreak , our economy is much stronger in all important respects than it was in 1950 , despite a much heavier defense burden . It is stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is less threatened by inflation , which was supposed by some to be the terrible danger of a big and sustained defense burden . 2 . The nation now has the economic potential , with 10 out excessive strain or undue controls , to lift its annual output year by year , more rapidly than any increases in defense outlays proposed by any responsible experts in this field . Consequently , the nation is able ? insofar as security needs dictate ? to undertake any responsibly pro ? posed defense program , and at the same time further to increase its economic strength . 3 . Under conditions now pertaining and foreseeable in the American economy , current and foreseeable tax revenues should be adjusted to the level of public spend ? ing required to support the national security and to advance the economic well-being and promote the con ? tinuous growth of the economy , instead of public spend ? ing being adjusted to current and foreseeable or desirable tax revenues . The assertion by some of us in mid-1950 that an all-out program of expanding production would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden was regarded as heresy by many . But those who came to scoff have remained to pray . M EASURED in uniform prices , our total gross national product , which was at an annual rate of about $300 billion in the first half of 1950 , has risen to an annual rate of close to $375 billion now . This gain of about $75 billion in our annual rate of production has enormously exceeded the rise in public outlays resulting from the defense program . Total government purchases of goods and services -- -federal , state and local ? measured in the same uniform prices , have risen from an annual rate of about $45 billion in the first half of 1950 to an annual rate of about $82 billion now , an increase of only about $37 billion , or not much more than half of the increase in our annual national product during the same period of time , In consequence , despite the huge diver ? sion of a large part of the nation 's productive resources to security purposes , there has been far more left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an enormous expansion of our productive facilities . On all scores , our economic strength has increased at a very heartening rate , despite the defense program . It is true that the nation underwent a period of rapid inflation in late 1950 and early 1951 . Perhaps different types of programs might have contained this inflation better during the early months of the defense program . But looking at the economy as it is now , hardly anybody can be found who will say that the spurt of inflation did us harm comparable to the enormous economic gains registered since mid-1950 . In any event , we have had a remarkably stable price level since early 1951 , thus refuting the idea held by many a few years ago that full employment and full production are necessarily infla ? tionary . If we should be confronted by a new emergency , call ? ing for as rapid a spurt in our defense efforts and in the building of our productive facilities as took place shortly after the Korean outbreak , we would have to find better ways of checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there is no reason to suppose that the maintenance of full employment and full production during the next few years , which means continuous expansion as technology and population increase , would have substantial inflationary consequences measured against the real economic gains , even if there should be a substantial but not an extreme increase in the defense program . Therefore , the most unassailable of all eco ? nomic propositions is that we should now and in the years ahead bend every energy toward maintaining full employment and full production . Without the forced pressures of a full war economy , and without the use of direct controls , we have the re ? sources , the technology and science , the business brains and labor skills , and the growing population , to lift the annual rate of our national product from the current level of about $375 billion to close to $500 billion by 1960 . It is perfectly palpable that , if we succeed fairly well in this effort , our economy can grow much stronger year by year , even if the requirements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest amounts proposed by any responsible experts . Indeed , the fact that our productive potential at an annual rate is due to increase by close to $125 billion within seven years means that we shall be challenged to find ways to utilize all of our economic resources intel ? ligently , instead of letting them lie idle , even if public outlays at an annual rate should rise 10 or 20 or more billion dollars above current levels . Even at the $20 billion figure , we would still by 1960 have to expand consumption and business investment enough to absorb about $100 billion more per annum than currently . The argument is advanced by some people that we certainly have the economic resources and the productive strength to fulfill the obligations which the world situa ? tion thrusts upon us , but that we do not have the fiscal strength to do so . This argument runs along the line that the basic test of our economic position is to be found in the condition of the Federal Budget rather than in the condition of the national economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deficits , and an enlargement of the national debt , would bring us to ultimate ruin even if we maintained full employment and full production and constantly enlarged our national product . The facts are that , since World War II , the fiscal affairs of the federal government have been managed on a very prudent basis , in terms of the relationship between expenditures and receipts . During the fiscal years from 1947 through 1953 , and including the current Treasury estimate for the fiscal year 1954 , the government for the eight years as a whole will have achieved a surplus of receipts over expenditures in the neighborhood of $13 billion by the consolidated cash method of accounting which most economists and businessmen agree is the most valid method of accounting for purposes of eco ? nomic analysis . Even under the conventional budget method of accounting , the federal government for these eight years will have run a deficit of only about $10 billion , which amounts to only about one-third of one percent of our national output during these eight years . We must learn to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy . If we should exper ? ience in calendar 1954 even the kind of moderate eco ? nomic recession that some people are talking about as inevitable , our total national output in 1954 could be $40 to $60 billion lower than if we maintain full em ? employment and full production . This $40 to $60 billion would represent a real and irretrievable loss to the whole nation and to all the people . Just by way of adding to the perspective , if $5 or $10 billion of increased outlays next year for con ? tinental defense were to mean the difference between this " moderate recession " and the maintenance of full prosperity , it is clear beyond ques ? tion that we would be economically better off with this continental de ? fense than without it ? even if it meant a larger federal deficit . Be ? sides , if we had a drop of $40 to $60 billion in our national output next year , tax reduction would be inescap ? able , many types of public expendi ? tures would necessarily rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level off or be reduced ? would be greater than the federal deficit would be if 1954 is a fully prosperous year and even if defense spending is decreased . Looking further ahead , if we follow those policies which help to lift our annual national output to near $500 billion by 1960 , and if through building our strength we can avoid a total war , the condition of the Federal Budget over these seven years ahead is going to be Very good indeed under any foreseeable levels of expenditures and taxes . Whether there is a federal sur ? plus averaging less than $5 billion a year during these seven years , or a federal deficit averaging less than $5 billion a year during these seven years is not a large enough question to justify us in shrinking from vastly more important tasks and responsibilities . O N THE expenditure side , it is my belief that expendi ? tures for purposes other than national defense are now near an irreducible minimum , and that some types of prime resource development might even be in ? creased somewhat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With respect to defense expenditures , I am not an expert and have never claimed the ability to judge what they ought to be . But if the expert opinion is that they should be considerably higher than they now are , particularly with reference to improved continental defense , then I insist that we have the economic strength to do this and to grow and prosper at the same time . If defense expenditures should be substantially in creased , it would seem to me desirable to adopt legisla ? tion bringing the tax structure into line with what it now is , instead of allowing to remain in force the tax reduc ? tions scheduled for early next year . Somebody might devise a better tax structure than we now have , but the experience of recent years has shown that it works fairly well , and the controversies attendant upon extensive tax revision might distract us from more important prob ? lems . However , I think that the excess-profits tax should be allowed to die , because it tends to restrict productive advance . To obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , renewed and more vigorous efforts should be made to close tax loopholes . In view of the likely economic situation next year , unless defense expenditures were to be increased by many billions of dollars , I would doubt the desir ? ability of trying to increase the tax burden in the aggregate , because this would do more harm to economic progress than it would do good by balancing the budget. , Even if defense outlays should increase so greatly as to make some tax increases essential , I would not favor a comprehensive sales tax either at the manufacturers ' level or at the retail level , because it is not a fair kind of tax , and because it would , repress consumption . Even if there should be a quite large increase in defense outlays , consumption probably needs to be stimulated if the economy is to continue to advance . On the other hand , if defense outlays should level off or be reduced , in accord with current plans , there will be need for an enormous expansion of consumption to maintain growth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction scheduled for early next year should be allowed to remain in force , and the next priority should be a lightening of the tax burden on low income families , either through a raising of the exemp ? tions or in some other way . If signs of an economic reces ? sion should become more pronounced , further tax relief should be granted to reactivate the economy , but I do not think that this should be done precipitately because it seems to me that the longer-range economic trends are still very strong . Most important of all , we should not get into such a bog on the subject of taxation or budgetary policy that we neglect our supreme task . That supreme task is to place ourselves in a better position to negotiate toward peace by improving our defenses against sudden attack and by continuing to build our deterrent striking forces . In the accomplishment of this supreme task , our basic economic policy should be directed toward maintaining maximum employment and production , for only by in ? creasing our output every year can we with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inter ? national situation .
