Sworn in last week as Argentina 's new President , replacing deposed Strongman Juan Pern : Major General Eduardo Lonardi. 59 , a career officer whose name was unknown to most of his countrymen one week earlier Origins .

Graduated from the national military academy as artillery lieutenant . Taught tactics at Superior War College in 1930s . Appointed Argentine military attach in Santiago , Chile in 1943 , where he succeeded Colonel Juan Pern who had been suspected of espionage by Chilean government . Served as Argentina 's representative on Inter-American Defense Board in Washington in 1947-48 . Retired as two-star general in 1951 after dismissal from command of Frist Army ( HQ Rosario ) for allegedly plotting against Pern Underground Career .

Suspected of participating in another plot the next year , he successfully defied police by demanding that a general of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept under surveillance until Pern in a moment of clouded foresight , decided he was harmless . <P> Private Life . After retirement , lived modestly in a Buenos Aires suburb swung an occasional business deal to supplement his pension . Father of three sons ( one a U.S.-trained engineer ) , two daughters . With slightly stooped shoulders and horn-rimmed reading glasses , looks more like a professor than a general when in mufti . <P> Political Outlook . Reportedly a middle-road conservative without party affiliation . Nationalistic , in the Argentine army tradition , but not rabidly so Prospects . Clearing away the rubble of the shattered Pern regime is only the beginning . Problems are mainly political ; economic ailments nagged the country under Peron . but Argentina is a basically rich country with wonderfully fertile soil probably needs little economic doctoring beyond a healthy dose of freedom . Toughest task is likely to be dealing with the sullen labor-confederation members who won substantial gains under Peron and hated to see him go .               @ @ @ @ @ @
