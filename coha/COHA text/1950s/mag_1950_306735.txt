Last week Washington 's Corcoran Gallery opened the liveliest art show the capital had seen in many a month . Its big , rambling " American Procession : 1492-1900 " filled twelve galleries and six corridors , and was as exciting and various as the history it recounted . Moreover , there was n't a painting that the average summer visitor could n't grasp at first blink . <P> For eight months , 15 Corcoran staff members had scoured the U.S. , made expeditions to Canada , Mexico and Europe to round up paintings , prints and Americana . In Paris they uncovered a 1775 mezzotint of A Society of Patriotic Ladies at Edenton , N.C. emptying their tea caddies in protest against George III 's unwelcome taxes . From Canada 's National Gallery came Benjamin West 's enormous , detailed <P> Death of Wolfe , on loan for the first time . The Mexican National Museum of History contributed scenes from the Mexican War , and from his private collection King George VI sent a print of a naval engagement on Lake Champlain . <P> The Corcoran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait of Columbus , ended with realistic turn-of-the-century studies of New York 's lower East Side . Along the way there were pictures of battles and historic meetings done in the grand style . <P> When gallerygoers got tired of pomp &; circumstance , they could relax with many a pleasant glimpse of U.S. manners , e.g. , Edwin Elmer 's A Lady of Baptist Corner , <P> Ashfield , Mass. , or a visiting Russian watercolorist 's impressions of early 19th Century Night Life in Philadelphia ( some young fops and a floozy gathered around an oyster barrel ) . <P> Besides gleanings for the curious , there was some good art : early genre studies by Winslow Homer , William Glackens ' moveing paintings of the Spanish-American War , and Thomas Eakins ' The Agnew Clinic , 1889 , a monumental study of an operation in an early hospital . There was even a small painting by the great French impressionist , Edgar Degas , of 19th Century Cotton Merchants . But the show 's main appeal was to the ordinary American with a warm heart and a taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by the time the Corcoran closed its big cavalcade in December , Americans trooping to " see the show would break all attendance records .
