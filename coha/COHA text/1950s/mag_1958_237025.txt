Philadelphia 's Mayor Richardson Dilworth was crying as he groped for a phrase that could crystallize an emotion . " It is a horrible thing , " he sobbed finally , to 50 mourners at the lamplit coffin in a small West Philadelphia funeral home , " that this could happen in our city . " The mayor 's tears said it better . In the coffin lay the patched body of 26-year-old In Ho Oh , onetime interpreter for U.S. troops in Korea , onetime honor student at Seoul 's National University and currently enrolled as a University of Pennsylvania political science exchange student . An eleven-member teen-aged Negro gang had pummeled In Ho Oh to death with a blackjack , a lead pipe and hard-toed shoes , while looking for the admission price of a 35 neighborhood dance . <P> The street-shadows assault was even more brutal because it was luck-of-the-draw . As police put the thing together , the gang decided to roll a passer-by for money . In Ho Oh , in shirtsleeves , had slipped out of his uncle 's apartment close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was attacked as he was doubling back . Two boys shackled the Korean 's arms , others knocked off his glasses , hammered him to the ground , dragged his body behind a parked automobile and frisked pockets and socks for money that was n't there . When police reached Oh , his face had been chopped to unrecognizable pulp . He died ten minutes later . <P> Within 42 hours , police , swarming into the integrated area around the Penn campus , collared all eleven of the junior-grade thugs , aged 15 to 19 . In municipal court a pursed-lipped judge quickly ruled they must be tried for murder as adults . Philadelphia , its brotherly love strained like many another U.S. city 's by the mounting onslaught of teen-age warfare ( TIME , April 7 ) , was patently disgusted with sociological explanations , was angry enough for a hard approach to juvenile delinquency . Urged the Philadelphia Bulletin : " A soft policy toward the owners of hands dripping with blood is a frightful mistake . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
