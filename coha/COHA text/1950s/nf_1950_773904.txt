txt // control grid and the injector grid to control the electron stream and is known as electron coupling . The composite tube , termed a triode-heptode , has a common cathode with the triode mounted above the heptode section . The screen grid , which shields the injector grid and serves the same purpose as in the screen-grid tube , consists of two internally connected portions with the injector grid located between them ; control and suppressor grids are located in their standard positions . The addition of the injector grid introduces a new tube factor analogous to the transconductance factor in a triode . This factor , termed con-version transconductance and expressed in micromhos , is defined as the ratio of the intermediate-frequency component of the out-put current of the converter tube to the high-frequency com ponent of the input-signal voltage applied to the control grid . The action of this combined oscillator and mixer tube may also be realized in a single structure , the pentagrid converter , which has five grids in addition to the cathode and the anode . This tube combines the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one structure . The simplified circuit of Fig. 4 ? 30 shows that grids 1 and 2 are used as the oscillator grid and anode , respectively . Emitted electrons , after passing through these two grids , are further influenced by the control grid 4 , which is shielded from the oscillator anode by the screen grid 3 and from the main anode by the screen grid 5 . The two screen grids are connected together within the tube . In the construc tion of one form of the tube , grid 1 surrounds the cathode , but grid 2 , which is used as the oscillator anode , actually consists of a pair of side rods but no grid wires are attached to them . Many of the electrons approaching these rods possess sufficiently high // velocities so that they move beyond the equivalent oscillator anode ; the majority pass through the screen grid 3 and approach the negatively charged grid 4 , which retards the oncoming electron stream . The concentration of electrons between grids 3 and 4 constitutes a virtual cathode for the tetrode or equivalent screen-grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero potential or is only slightly negative or positive , the virtual cathode has an ample electron supply for the tetrode portion of the tube . Whenever grid 1 assumes a more negative potential , as it does when it functions as the oscillator grid , the number of electrons arriving at the main anode is temporarily reduced . Consequently , current pulsations at oscillator frequency are supplied to the tetrode portion , and the electron stream to the main anode is modulated in addition by the high-frequency signal voltage on grid 4 . The main anode current , similar to that in the previously described tube , contains the desired intermediate frequency , the other three high frequencies , and the low frequencies that modulate the carrier . The bias for the control grid is partially obtained from the voltage drop across a resistor in the detector diode circuit and varies , of course , with the strength of the received signal . By impressing this variable grid bias on the control grid of the converter as well as on the grids of the other radio-frequency amplifying tubes , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , automatic volume control . This eliminates variation of the receiver output even though the received signal fades and prevents blasting or overloading from strong local stations during tuning . Since converter tubes combine the function of an oscillator , mixer , and amplifier in a single tube , they find extensive application in automobile and midget-type radio receivers . They are also used where dual grid control is important , as in multivibrator circuits to obtain frequency division and in phonograph amplifiers to modify the frequency response characteristic . Problems 1 . A tube manual gives the following characteristics of a screen-grid tube : anode voltage 250 ; screen-grid voltage 90 ; control-grid bias -3 volts ; anode current 4 milliamperes ; screen-grid current 1.7 milliamperes ; plate resistance 600,000 ohms ; transconductance 1050 micromhos . What is the // amplification constant at these operating values ? How much power must be dissipated by the screen grid ? 2 . The screen-grid tube described in Problem 1 is used in the circuit shown in Fig. 4-2 . The load resistor in the anode circuit has a resistance of 17,500 ohms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to obtain the correct control-grid bias ? 3 . A cathode-ray tube is operated with - 1150 volts on the cathode and +1500 volts on the intensifier ring . Other electrodes are at zero or ground potential . The distance between the cathode and the center of the screen is 16 inches . With what velocity do electrons strike the fluorescent screen ? 4 . A 110-volt 60-cycle supply line is connected to the vertical , and a 5-volt 180-cycle third harmonic is connected to the horizontal , deflection terminals of a cathode-ray oscilloscope . Both amplifiers are adjusted so that each maximum deflection is 2 inches long . Plot the trace that appears on the screen if : ( a ) the voltages are in phase at the beginning of any cycle ; ( b ) the 60-cycle fundamental voltage leads the 180-cycle harmonic by 60 ? or A-6 o second . 5 . In determining the anode characteristic of a triode by means of a cathode-ray oscilloscope , as shown in Fig. 4-16 , two tests are made using ( 1 ) an alternating voltage and a battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfiltered output voltage of a full-wave rectifier . The alternating voltage is adjusted so as to reduce the total anode voltage to zero at the end of each cycle , and the maximum anode voltage is made the same in both tests .

( b ) Why or why not is the anode characteristic of the tube as shown on the screen the same for both tests ? 6 . A radar antenna covering an area of 40 square feet delivers a radio beam through a plane angle of 7r/12 or 15 ? . The energy is reflected from a target 60 miles away . What is the ratio of received power to that received from a broadcast transmitter of the same average power ? 7 . The grid and anode of the second section Vv , of the twin triode , shown in Fig. 4-28 , are not directly connected to the d-c power supply .

Why can not the Wheatstone bridge described in Sec. 4-11 be used to measure accurately the resistance of iron-cored choke or transformer coils ? 9 . Assume that the potentiometer R5 in Fig. 4-28 is a uniformly wound 800-ohm potentiometer and that a fixed resistor of 800 ohms is connected from the slider to the point where R5 joins R7 . Remembering that the resistance of two resistors in parallel is equal to the product of the individual resistances divided by their sum , plot the curve showing the variation of the resistance between the slider and the junction of R5 and R7 against percentage of slider rotation . 10 . In the pentagrid converter circuit , Fig. 4-30 , no bias voltage is shown on the oscillator grid . For proper operation the average negative // voltage on the oscillator grid is as much as 30 to 40 volts , and the maximum instantaneous negative voltage may be 60 to 80 volts . Describe in detail how the oscillator grid receives its bias when the tube is first energized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special-purpose Vacuum Tubes There has been a great demand during recent years for tubes capable of generating ultrahigh frequencies for use in radio communication , television , and radar equipment . This need has been met by the development of tubes that incorporate changes in structural design and by others that utilize new principles of operation . We shall review some of these types and shall also consider several other tubes that have been designed for specific but very important purposes . Moreover , we shall find that some of the special-purpose tubes utilize novel and interesting methods of circumventing basic limitations , while others , such as X-ray tubes , which extend man 's vision , and cyclotrons , which transmute elements , are an important part of our modern world . 5-1 . Disc-seal Tubes The high-frequency response of the previously described tubes and circuits is limited on the one hand by interelectrode and parasitic capacitances , and on the other by inductances of the leads from the electrodes to the tube terminals and the connections to the resonant circuits . It is apparent that the leads in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in glass , act as the plates of a capacitor , and consequently an ordinary triode has an appreciable capacitance between the leads that connect the electrodes to the circuit , aside from the interelectrode capacitances . The grid connection at the side of the triode , shown in Fig. 3-1 , is arranged to reduce capacitance between the grid and the cathode leads and thus increases the frequency response of the tube . Further steps in this direction lie clearly 165 // in the reduction of the size of the electrodes within the tube and in the elimination of long leads from the tube electrodes to the resonant circuits . The triode shown in the cutaway view of Fig. 5 ? 1 is of the external anode type and is arranged for forced-air cooling . It is designed with a coaxial fila ment stem and a grid struc ture which terminates in a ring-type grid seal that allows the tube to be seated in direct contact with the chassis or mounting . Single-turn induc tors serve as the external por tions of the resonant circuits and are combined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate . Ring-type grid-seal tubes de-liver an output of several kilowatts at a frequency of 110 megacycles per second , whereas ordinary triodes can be operated to produce full power at frequencies only as high as 50 megacycles per second and at slightly higher frequencies if the maximum values of anode voltage and power input are reduced . The disc-seal tube is a further improvement on the basic idea of combining the tube and the circuit . This tube may be described by considering first the simple resonator shown in the upper portion of Fig. 5-2 . The cross section shows a cylindrical cavity fitted with a solid metal stud through the center and separated from the lower electrode by a small air gap . The stud is the anode , and the lower electrode is the grid . Multiple spring contact fingers complete the circuit between the metallic discs that form the ends of a glass cylinder // and the separate , external portion of the cavity . All surfaces are silver plated to insure low electrical losses and good cir cuit contacts . The two opposing surfaces , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the surrounding metal wall acts as a single-turn inductor . At a certain frequency this single-turn , completely inclosed , resonant cavity is identical to a parallel resonant circuit if a variable-frequency voltage is connected to the two surfaces of the air gap . The changing electric field is concentrated between the two surfaces at the axis and decreases uniformly to zero at the periphery of the cavity . The changing magnetic field is also confined to the cavity , and con sequently the structure is completely shielded . Energy is ex tracted from the cavity by means of a coupling loop and a transmission line . In the lighthouse tube , shown in cross section in Fig. 5-3 , one such cavity is the grid-to-anode section , and another , similar , inverted cavity is used as the grid-to-cathode section . The former is placed above the latter to form a double resonator . A portion of each cavity is made a part of the tube with a metal to-glass seal . Each cavity is equipped with a coupling loop , con nected to a transmission line , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the input circuit if feed-back is desired or if the tube is to act as an oscillator . // The cathode , grid , and anode are placed in close proximity , and hence the transit time of the electrons is extremely short . The grid , located between a flat cathode and the anode , consists of a woven mesh of very fine tungsten wires brazed to a . cup , which is deformed during construction to stress the wires to a plane surface and to keep them taut at the processing and operating temperatures . Power-supply connections are made through the base of the tube , which fits a standard octal socket . A mica bypass capacitor is built in as a part of the tube and is used for the isolation of the direct voltage on the grid . A cutaway view of a small triode of the lighthouse type is shown in Fig. 5-4 . This tube , when used as an amplifier , has a power output of 20 watts at an operating frequency of 400 mega-cycles per second . A somewhat similar but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is capable of generating up to 10 kilowatts of pulse-output power at a frequency of 1200 megacycles per second . 5 ? 2 . The Klystron The close spacing of the electrodes and the utilization of cavity resonators extend the upper frequency limit in triode oscillators to about 1000 megacycles per second , but the power capacity is limited by the intense fields between the electrodes , and the interelec-trode capacitances are too large for efficient resonant circuits . Moreover , high-frequency resistance of the conductors and dielectric losses cause inefficiency in these circuits . For sharp resonance , inductors and ca-pacitors must have a high figure of merit or Q , which is defined as where X is the reactance in ohms , and R is the effective resistance in ohms of the inductor or capacitor . Values of Q range from about 20 to 100 for coils on iron cores used in broadly tuned low-frequency resonant circuits to approximately 30,000 for the sharply resonant silver-plated cavity resonators used in ultrahigh-frequency circuits . The frequency limitation imposed by the interelectrode capacitances of the tube may be seen by noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequencies of 3000 megacycles per // second , with an inductor as low as 0.1 microhenry in the resonant circuit , the required capacitance would be only a fractional part of a micromicrofarad ? a value impossible to achieve except with microscopic electrodes . Furthermore , the transit time required for electrons to pass from the cathode to the anode , even with high anode voltages , consumes the time equivalent to several cycles . These factors , therefore , definitely bar the use of triodes in ultrahigh-frequency amplifiers and oscillators . The idea of producing a velocity-modulated electron beam was conceived by S. F. Varian in 1937 , and shortly after this he with R. H. Varian and 1V . W. Hansen developed a vacuum tube , termed a klystron , that utilized this principle . In an ordinary triode , the electron stream varies in density according to grid potential changes ; with velocity modulation the electrons are emitted from the cathode in the form of a beam of uniform density , accelerated to a constant velocity by a smoother grid , and then , in passing through another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive or decelerated if it is negative . If an alternating voltage is applied to the control grid , the electrons that pass through it during the time it is negatively charged move into the space beyond at a lower speed than those that pass through the grid at a later time when it is positively charged . The higher-speed electrons overtake the slower ones , and this results in concentrating or bunching the electrons in the field-free drift space beyond the grid . A suitable collector or catcher electrode is placed at an appropriate distance from the grid . The beam of electrons imparts its energy to the catcher in the form of periodic pulses , which correspond to the bunches , and the pulsations are then conveyed to an external circuit by suitable coupling means . Basically , therefore , velocity modulation consists of converting a uniform-density constant-velocity electron beam into one in which the electrons have a periodically higher and lower velocity , by virtue of which the electron beam is converted into one of variable density . This variable-density beam of electrons imparts energy to a resonant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving bunches of electrons . The location of the parts of a klystron amplifier may be seen by referring to Fig. 5-5 . All grids are designed Nvith radial strips similar to the spokes of a wheel . The buncher consists of two grids that form the opposite walls of a re-entrant-type input // cavity . The catcher or output cavity is similar to the input cavity , and both are equipped with small hairpin-shaped loops by means of which energy may be extracted from the output cavity through a coaxial terminal or inserted in the input cavity . Any energy that remains in the electron beam after it passes through the catcher is dissipated in the collector , which is equipped with fins for air cooling . The bunching of electrons may be visualized graphically by means of the space-time Applegate diagram , Fig. 5-6 , where for any given electron the distance along the drift space is plotted as a function of time . The velocity of any electron at any instant , therefore , is represented by the slope of the line at that point ; high electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of the diagram show that the electrons enter the buncher as a beam of uniform density and velocity . Transit time across the buncher electrodes is assumed to be negligible , but the velocity of each electron as it crosses the gap is modified by the high-frequency field which varies according to the buncher voltage drawn below the diagram . The electron velocities increase , decrease , or remain constant , as indicated by // the slope of the lines in the drift space . The beam current at the catcher is nonuniform with respect to time and has a frequency component equivalent to the high-frequency buncher voltage . This voltage is shown at the top of the diagram . A simplified circuit of a klystron oscillator is shown in Fig. 5-7 . Adjustment of a klystron is very critical because tuning , which is accomplished by changing the capacitance between grids , also affects the spacing . The gain of a klystron amplifier varies between 5 and 20 . As oscillators , the tubes are capable of delivering continuous power of about 50 watts at a frequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-cavity reflex klystron oscillators deliver about 1 watt at 10,000 megacycles per second and are capable of generating fre-quencies as high as 30,000 megacycles per second at an output power somewhat less than 0.1 watt . High-frequency oscillators are frequently referred to as micro-wave generators , the frequency f in cycles per second and the wavelength A in meters being related by the equation where c is the velocity of electromagnetic radiation , that is , 3.00 X 108 meters per second . For the radiobroadcast band , covering from 550 to 1600 kilocycles per second , the corresponding // wavelengths range between 545.5 and 187.5 meters , whereas the radiation produced by a klystron operating at 30,000 megacycles per second has a wavelength of only 1 centimeter. 5-3 . Magnetrons Magnetic control of an electron stream in a vacuum tube , even though proposed as early as 1921 by A. W. Hull , found very little practical application until the principle was adopted in ultra high-frequency oscillators . A simple magnetron is a diode in which the electrons are controlled by a magnetic field arranged so that it is perpendicular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anode . The electrons , emitted by a centrally located cathode , proceed in straight radial paths to the sur rounding cylindrical , positively charged anode , but when an ex ternal magnetic field is applied the electrons are deflected in a curved path . As the field is increased the curvature of the paths of the electrons increases until they just miss the anode , with the result that the current to the anode drops abruptly to zero and the electrons return to the cathode after having gone through a heart-shaped path . Anode current in a simple magnetron is a function of the anode voltage and the strength of the magnetic field as shown in Fig. 5-8 . The controlling magnetic field is con- // veniently obtained by inserting the iagnetron in a , solenoid through which an adjustable direct current flows . In an alter nate arrangeinent a permanent magnet supplies a constant mag netic field , and anode-current cutoff is then obtained by lowering the anode voltage . By combining the magnetron principle and a multicavity resonator in an electron tube , a iagnetron oscillator capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained . The tube comprises a complete radio transmitter except for the power supply and the antenna . As indicated in the cutaway drawing , Big . 5-9 , the centrally located heater-type cathode is surrounded by a cylindrical anode which contains a number of symmetrically arranged resonant cavities . Vanelilce metallic scginents , extending between adjacent cavities , form the parallel surfaces for the capacity portions of the reso nators The magnetic field , indicated by the clotted line rectors , is supplied by a permanent magnet . A coupling loop for the extraction of high-frequency energy is mounted within one of the cavities . During operation , a given electron emitted by the cathode is accelerated toward the positively charged anode and as it moves // the stationary magnetic field causes it to traverse a curved path which is in a clockwise direction for the field indicated in the figure . An alternating electric field , due to the cavities performing as oscillating circuits and with opposite polarities on adjacent segments , also reacts on the flight of an electron . Its path is that of a cycloid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short distance away from the cathode , after which the action is repeated until the electron reaches the anode . At each step , that is , at the end of every excursion where the electron has moved with the d-c field for a greater distance than it has moved . against it , energy has been transferred from the stationary electric field to that of the oscillating field . Each step of an electron requires one-half period of the oscillating frequency , and in this time the electron moves from one cavity to the next . The oscillating field is directed so that it opposes that motion , and energy is delivered to the oscillating field until the electron ultimately arrives at the anode . Magnetrons are built in a number of sizes and vary in diameter from about z to 10 inches or more . The smaller tubes , such as those shown in Fig. 5-10(a) , generate 3-centimeter wavelengths and are used widely in airborne radar equipment ; the larger tubes generate longer wavelengths . They have from 8 to 18 resonant cavities . When used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microseconds and deliver a peak output of 1000 kilowatts or more . They then remain inactive for the succeeding several hundred microseconds , and during this time they cool . The duration of the ultrahigh-frequency pulses is controlled by energizing periodically the anode with a direct voltage . Multicavity magnetrons are essentially fixed-frequency devices and are not adaptable to tuning over a wide band of frequencies . Slight changes in frequency may be made in certain designs by adjustment through vacuum seals . A tube of this type is shown in Fig. 5-10(b) . Transmission lines and hollow wave guides are commonly used to couple magnetron transmitters to radar antennas. 5-4 . The Resnatron A klystron can deliver about 100 watts and the magnetron can " supply only a few kilowatts of ultrahigh-frequency energy continuously . In 1938 D. H. Sloan and L. C. Marshall developed // the resnatron , which is able to generate 50 or more kilowatts of ultrahigh-frequency energy continuously . The tube , as shown in Fig. 5-11 , is a tetrode and consists basically of a cylindrical cathode ( composed of a large number of flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid , an anode , and two resonant cavities . One of these cavities is located between the cathode and the control grid ; the other , between the accelerator grid and the anode . The control and accelerator grids are arranged so that the flow of electrons from the cathode to the anode is not obscured ; that is. radial beams of electrons leave the filaments of the cathode and have a clear path to the surrounding anode . The operation of the tube closely resembles that of the class C triode amplifier described in Sec. 3-7 . The accelerator arid and the anode are at high positive potentials with respect to the cathode , but the control grid is biased negatively beyond the cutoff point . No electrons leave the cathode until the control-grid bias exceeds the critical value . As in a class C amplifier , this occurs only for a brief moment during any one cycle when electrons pass through the control grid at relatively low speeds and are accelerated to a high velocity by the positively charged accelerator grid . Their final velocity is governed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grid , and they arrive as a bunch . In the meantime the oscillating field has reversed the phase relations of the resonant cavity , of which the ac celerator grid and anode are a part , and the electrons find themselves in a negative field where they slow down , impart their // acquired energy to the field , and reach the anode with negligible velocity . The important problem of cooling is met in the resnatron by circulating water through the accelerator grid and the anode . The upper horizontal rod is the cathode-cavity tuning drive ; the lower one adjusts the anode cavity . Coupling loops are used for feedback and for the removal of ultrahigh-frequency energy . A diffusion pump associated with the tube maintains the requisite vacuum . A number of large resnatrons were constructed and gave excellent performance as radar countermeasures in World War II . Typical operating conditions require a filament power supply of 1800 amperes at 2 volts and an anode power supply of approximately 8 amperes at 17 kilovolts . At these operating values , the tube delivers an output of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube , variation of the intensity and twodimensional deflection of the electron beam is obtained ; in effect this is equivalent to three-dimensional control . Either electric or magnetic fields provide the control means and make possible other special-purpose vacuum tubes . Several years ago , R. Adler proposed an ingenious tube terined the phasitron . It employs a focusing electric field to produce a horizontal circular disc of electrons ; another electric field bends the disc in a vertical direction so that the edge follows a sinusoidal line and by its variation produces rotation of the profile about the vertical axis ; and a third alternating magnetic field deflects the electrons in a circumferential direction and advances or retards the phase of the rotating corrugated electron disc with respect to a mean or normal angular velocity . This tube offers a simple means to phasemodulate a constant-amplitude carrier frequency in accordance with an audio frequency and greatly simplifies the circuit and construction of a frequency-modulated transmitter . The tube is constructed with an axially located cathode , as shown in Fig. 5 ? 12 ( a I . An upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conjunction with another focusing electrode 2- , both at a positive potential with respect to the cathode , cause the centrally emitted electrons to form into a tapered , thin-edged disc which we shall consider as a neutral I // plane with the cathode as the axis . Electrons in the disc move radially toward two concentric anodes that have a still higher positive potential with respect to the cathode . The inner anode is made with a group of 24 evenly spaced rectangular holes , each alternate one being located above and below the neutral plane . No outer-anode current flows except when the electron disc is deflected so that electrons pass through the openings of the inner anode . // The deflector grid consists of 36 concentrically arranged wires with the top portion of each turned at right angles , like the spokes of a wheel , and located below the neutral plane . Grid wires are interconnected in three groups with every fourth wire connected to a particular group . When these wire groups are connected to a three-phase sinusoidally varying alternating voltage , the resulting field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sinusoidally displaced , and gives the disc a fluted configuration as shown in Fig. 5-12(b) . The three-phase voltage on the deflector grid also produces a revolving electric field and synchronous rotation of the fluted electron disc . As the disc rotates , all electrons above the neutral plane pass through the upper holes , and those below that plane pass through the lower holes of the inner anode and proceed to the outer anode . At the instant when the A group of deflector-grid wires are at a maximum negative voltage , the 12 upper portions of the fluted electron disc pass through the corresponding upper holes in the inner anode , while the B and C groups , being positive at that instant , cause the remaining portions of the electron disc to pass through the 12 lower holes of the inner anode . The outer-anode current at that instant is , therefore , at its maximum , and the inner-anode current is at its minimum , value . At an instant one-half cycle later , the fluted portions of the electron disc are opposite the spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer-anode current is then at its minimum and the inner-anode current is at its maximum value . Either anode current varies sinusoidally and at a frequency determined by the three-phase alternating voltage on the deflector grid . The tube is mounted within a coaxial coil through which a varying audio-frequency current flows . The resulting magnetic field acts on the electrons comprising the fluted disc and displaces them counterclockwise or clockwise , that is , it increases or decreases the angular velocity of the electron disc in accordance with the direction and magnitude of the magnetic field . Rotational oscillations of the electron disc find a mechanical analogy in the hunting of an insufficiently damped rotor of a synchronous motor . The displacement of the disc produces a phase shift in the output current of the outer anode , and a phasemodulated carrier-frequency voltage is developed across the terminals of the load through which that current flows . // The simplicity of a frequency-modulated transmitter , incorporating the phasitron , may be inferred from the block diagram , Fig. 5-13 . A modulation coil surrounding the tube is energized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed so that it contains very little resistance and consists of practically a pure inductance . Its reactance , therefore , for all practical purposes varies directly with the frequency , and the current through the coil decreases as the modulating audio frequency increases . The magnetic control field varies in conformity with the magnitude of the current and consequently phase-modulates the crystal-controlled oscillator frequency within the tube and effectively produces conversion of a vary-. ing amplitude-modulated signal into a corresponding frequency modulated carrier . The two factors that change in an audio-. frequency voltage are frequency and amplitude . Frequency finds its counterpart in a frequency-modulated carrier in the rapidity with which the carrier shifts in frequency about the crystal-con trolled mean frequency ; amplitude is reflected in the extent or deviation of the carrier frequency from its mean position . The block diagram shows a phase-splitting network that changes the carrier voltage from single phase to three phase . In a specific example , a 230-kilocycle-per-second voltage is impressed on a phasitron grid , and the changing magnetic field introduces a proportionate phase shift equivalent to plus or minus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phasitron passes through a group of frequency doubler and tripler stages , yielding a total frequency multiplication of 432 . Such a transmitter delivers an average or a mean carrier of 99.36 megacycles per second , which remains constant because of the crystal-controlled oscillator but which is frequency-modulated to plus or minus 75 kilocycles per second . 5-6 . Electronic Transducer Tubes If the anode of a conventional triode is flexibly mounted , any mechanical acceleration causes a change in the relative position of that electrode with respect to the cathode and grid , and a corresponding change in anode current . This effect is utilized in an electronic transducer tube , where the movement of an anode translates a mechanical acceleration or displacement into a cor responding measurable voltage . A tube of this type , such as the one illustrated in Fig. 5-14 , can be used to measure accelera tions of high-speed aircraft , parachutes , and seat-ejection equip ment used in jet-propelled airplanes . The tube contains a fixed , indirectly heated cathode , and two anodes in the form of plates are elastically mounted , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates are deflected by an acceleration , the anode current changes proportionately . Accelerations can cause movement only if they are directed normal to the plates , and consequently , depending on the number of axes to be explored , two or three tubes must be used to obtain a recording of other than linear accelerations . The elastic mounting of the plates has a fundamental frequency of about 800 cycles per second . The tube is commonly used in a Wheatstone bridge circuit , and a low-pass filter , which impedes the passage of any frequencies above 200 cycles , is inserted in the circuit to remove any natural frequency response . High output and wide frequency response make the recording of a rapidly varying acceleration possible ; no auxiliary amplifier is required . Accelerations of the order of 10 times gravity may be measured directly on a standard oscilloscope . In another electronic transducer , the vacuum-tube electrodes of a triode are inclosed in a small metallic tube approximately 1 inch long and about ' inch in diameter . The cathode and grid leads are brought out through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anode is attached to a very thin flexible metal diaphragm at the top of the tube , and the anode circuit is completed through the metal housing . A small arm projecting from the diaphragm on the outside of the tube , when moved , converts a mechanical displacement or movement into a corresponding variable anode current . 5-7 . X-ray Tubes While studying the performance of an electric current in a simple vacuum tube , W. K. Rontgen in 1895 noticed that a cardboard coated with barium platinocyanide salts fluoresced even though it was located some distance from the tube . Subsequent experimentation disclosed that the rays , which he termed X rays , are produced when rapidly moving electrons are suddenly stopped on striking a target ; that they are propagated in straight lines ; and that they , like light , may be reflected , refracted , diffracted , and polarized . In fact , they are a part of the electromagnetic spectrum and cover the range of wavelengths between about 0.25 and 1000 angstrom units . Early X-ray tubes consisted of two or sometimes three electrodes mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation the electric field between the cold cathode and the anode ionized the residual gas , and the resulting positive ions bombarded and released electrons from the cathode . These , in turn , bom-barded the anode , or anticathode , as it was termed , and caused X rays to be generated . The intensity of the rays was varied by changing the voltage between the anode and cathode and by regulat-ing the residual gas pressure . Development by W. D. Coolidge in 1912 of the hot-cathode high-vacuum X-ray tube introduced stability and uni-formity of performance and also gave complete control of the intensity and penetrating power of the rays . The cathode of the Coolidge tube is made in the form of a coiled tungsten filament , and the anode usually consists of a tungsten target . The anode surface is placed at an angle with respect to the axis of the tube , and the X-ray beam , originating from the focal spot on the anode , passes through the wall of the tube . Only about 1 per cent of the kinetic energy acquired by the electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converted into heat , and provisions must be made , particularly in the large sizes , to cool the anode . In some designs the target is imbedded in a copper mount-ing arranged so that water may be circulated within the mounting ; in other types the anode extension beyond the seal is equipped with radiating fins for natural or forced air cooling ; still others allow the tube to be operated while immersed in oil . A Coolidge X-ray tube , suitable for operation in oil , is illustrated in Fig. 5-15 . The anode voltage , which 185 // ordinarily ranges between 30 and 400 peak kilovolts , is obtained from a half- or preferably from a full-wave rectifier . Current through an X-ray tube varies between 2 and 1000 milliamperes and is adjusted by changing the filament current which changes the cathode temperature . X rays are absorbed differentially in their passage through matter , and the results are determined by noting the densities of the shadows on a fluorescent screen or on a photographically exposed X-ray film . Films used for this purpose consist of a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and coated on both sides of a transparent base material . Since less than I per cent of the incident X-ray energy is absorbed by the film to forms the latent image , calcium tungstate-coated intensifying screens are placed adjacent to the film on each side . During exposure the calcium tungstate salt fluoresces in proportion to the intensity of the X rays ; it emits ordinary light that intensifies the exposure and reduces the exposure time to as much as 4 ' - , of the time required without intensifying screens . Tubes with small focal spots produce better definition in radiographs than large ones but are limited in their current-carrying capacity and can not be used for long exposures without causing serious anode erosion . The anode of a standard diagnostic X-ray tube must withstand loadings of the order of 200 milliamperes at 80 kilovolts distributed over a focal spot area of about 0.155 square centimeter . The generated heat , equivalent to 103 kilowatts per square centimeter , causes the focal spot to reach temperatures almost equal to the melting point of tungsten . X-ray equipment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radiographs are taken of steel castings , which require a great deal of costly machine work , or of parts which on failure may cause serious damage and possible plant shutdown . A radiograph of a defective casting is shown in Fig. 5-16 . X rays are used to inspect machine parts or castings for cracks , slag or oxide inclusions , shrinkage areas , and the like . They are a valuable engineering aid in checking casting design . Fluoroscopes activated by X rays are used industrially in the examination of automobile tires , packaged foods , and citrus fruits ; as an inspection tool in foundries ; and for checking inserts for proper location in molded plastics . // Powerful X-ray equipment , in which the tube and auxiliary equipment are designed for operation as high as 2,000,000 volts , has been developed within recent years . The tubes are of the multisection type and consist of a number of glass cylinders fused to metal rings equipped with internal electrodes to focus the electron beam which originates from the cathode located at one end . A sectional drawing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate continuously at a current of 1.5 milliamperes , is shown in Fig. 5-17 . The resonance power-supply // transformer , which is designed to operate at a frequency of 180 cycles and which does not require an iron core , is arranged with the X-ray tube mounted in the central space . This construction facilitates making electrical connections to the 23 intermediate stainless-steel electrodes and also provides electrostatic shielding for the tube . Narrow silicon steel strips are welded to the interior of the tank which houses the unit ; they offer a low-reluctance path for the magnetic flux of the transformer . Freon gas at a pressure of about 55 pounds per square inch within the tank supplies the necessary insulation and cooling . The copper-backed tungsten target is located in an extension chamber ; both are water cooled . The lower terminal of the coil and the anode are grounded as shown in the simplified circuit , Fig. 5-18 . A three-phase motor M drives the separately excited 180-cycle alternator G , which is // connected to the primary winding P of the resonance transformer . Capacitance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformer together with other capacitances and the inductance of the secondary winding are chosen so as to make the natural frequency of the transformer 180 cycles per second . In the diagram this is represented equivalently by the addition of the capacitor C1 in the primary circuit . The secondary winding has taps for connection to the intermediate electrodes . The filament current is adjusted by means of a variable reactor L1i and the diameter of the electron beam , which determines the size of the focal spot , is controlled by vary ing the magnitude of a direct current through the focus coil L2 . A d-c milliammeter M1 registers the electron current through the tube ; the a-c milliammeter M2 , calibrated in megavolts peak , indi cates the secondary charging current that passes through the capacitor C2 . The unit is of the self-rectifying type ; that is , electrons emitted by the cathode are accelerated toward the anode only when the anode has a positive potential with respect to the cathode . An industrial high-voltage X-ray installation is il lustrated in Fig. 5-19 . The penetrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a target-to-film distance of 3 feet the exposure time for a 1,000,000-volt unit , operating at 3.0 milliamperes through 4 inches of steel , is only about 1.5 minutes . // The 2,000,000-volt unit produces an even more intense beam and requires still less exposure time ; for the same conditions and with an operating current of 1.5 milliamperes the exposure time is only 6 seconds . An analysis of X radiation discloses that a range of wave-lengths exists , that the longest wavelength depends on the trans parency of the tube window , and that the shortest wavelength depends solely on the magnitude of the anode-to-cathode voltage . Kinetic energy acquired by electrons , which are accelerated in a // vacuum within a diode , was given by the equation Ve = 11 ' 1 ' 1v2 ( Eq . 1-9 ) . In the case of electrons that are accelerated within an X-ray tube , their energy of Ve electron volts is transformed , when they are suddenly stopped at the target , into electro-magnetic radiation according to the equation where V is the maximum voltage applied between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.60 x 10-19 coulomb ) , in is the electron mass ( 9.11 X 10-3 ' kilogram ) , v is the electron velocity in meters per second , h is Planck 's constant ( 6.62 X 10-31 joule second ) , c is the velocity of light ( 3.00 X 108 meters per second ) , and Ao is the mininnun wavelength in meters of the specific group or band of X rays . From this equation the minimum wavelength in angstrom units and the maximum voltage across the tube are related by the expression The continuous radiation intensity of X rays varies directly with the current through the tube and approximately as the square of the voltage across it . Furthermore , it varies with the atomic number of the target material ; the higher the atomic number , the more intense the beam . When the anode voltage for a given target material is increased to a sufficiently high value , for instance up to 80 to 100 kilovolts for tungsten , characteristic rays appear superimposed on the continuous spectrum . These rays consist of a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They occur in groups , and the major ones are designated as the K , L , and M groups . Tungsten , for instance , emits groups of characteristic rays which have wavelengths of the order of 0.2 , 1.4 , and 6.9 angstrom units . They are produced when target material electrons are dislodged from atomic shells that have the same letter designation . The fact that electrons move from outer to inner orbits and in doing so emit radiant energy accounts for the various X-ray groups and the individual characteristic rays within them . The greatest energy changes , that is , those which occur near the nucleus and are designated as the K group of wavelengths , are the shortest // and the most intense . By interposing a suitable absorbing metal filter between the X-ray source and the point of application , the continuous X-ray spectrum may be eliminated and only the characteristic rays remain ; even some of these may be absorbed to the extent that only the most intense rays remain to yield a beam of monochromatic X rays . 5 ? 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X rays was clarified in 1912 when von Laue and his assistants diffracted the rays by means of the natural grating of crystalline plates . Although this demonstrated that X rays are electromagnetic radia tions similar to - visible light , the later-developed quantum theory regarded X rays , and light as well , as quanta of energy or photons . Both concepts have contributed greatly to the development of modern physics . Von Laue 's analysis was sim plified materially by W. H. and W. L. Bragg , who considered X rays to be reflected by the parallel planes of a crystal and who showed by experiments that diffraction may be considered to be the simple reflection of an incident , monochromatic X-ray beam . In Fig. 5 ? 20 the successive parallel planes of a crystal , separated by a distance d , are designated as Sl , S2 , and S3 . Two parallel rays RI and R2 of the X-ray beam impinge on the crystal at an angle B. The line P1N is drawn perpendicular to R1 , and from the drawing it is evident that the ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 before it strikes the reflecting surface S3 . If either distance NP ; ; or N plus P3M is equal to a wavelength A or an integer number of wavelengths , the reflected waves from the succes-sive crystal faces are in phase . Reflection , therefore , takes place only at the incidence angle given by the expression nA , = 2d sin B. See also Eq . 4-46 . When the wavelength , the order of the spectrum , and the incident angle 8 are known , X-ray diffraction can be used to determine the distance between molecular or atomic planes , and consequently analysis can be made of any material by measuring and com-paring the pattern recorded on a photo-graphic film . For instance , some antifouling marine paints are made with certain per-centages of cupric and cuprous oxides . Since each of these oxides yields its own diffrac-tion pattern and the relative densities of the lines in the composite pattern indicate the relative amounts of each oxide , an analysis is easily made . The Pyrex glass of ordinary X-ray tubes absorbs the rays quite readily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the rays are longer than 1.5 angstrom units . Beryllium is much more transparent . A typical water-cooled X-ray diffraction tube , having a target arranged at a 6 ? angle and equipped with two beryllium windows , is illustrated in Fig. 5-21. 193 // Diffraction equipment for industrial use is commonly designed in the form of a self-contained unit and arranged so that the X-ray tube is mounted vertically in a central position at the top , as shown in Fig. 5-22 . Diffraction cameras of various types may be mounted on accurately adjustable ways . Three major methods of analysis are illustrated in Fig. 5-23 . In ordinary diffraction with a Laue camera , the X-ray beam passes through the specimen and , if the specimen is a single crystal , produces a diagram of spots symmetrically disposed about the center . Fine powders of chemical substances or crystalline aggregates may be substituted for a single crystal , in which event the reflectX-ray // ing surfaces of a sufficiently great number of particles in the random displacement are turned so that reflection occurs and the pattern on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the electron diffraction pattern shown previously in Fig. 4-24(1) ) . Each of these rings has a uniform intensity and corresponds to one set of reflecting planes . A sec tion taken through a diameter of a diagram yields a line spectrum . Such a pattern is conveniently obtained on a camera where the strip of film is arranged around 360 ? with the specimen located at the center , as shown in Fig. 5 ? 23 ( b ) . A small hole in the film allows the X-ray beam to pass and acts as an index point . Diffraction spectra of the powder type , such as those given in // Fig. 5-24 , are employed for routine identification of unknown substances . The back reflection camera , Fig. 5-23(c) , is used for the precise measurements of lattice constants , measurement of surface stresses , observation of distortion in crystals , and the deternunation of composition of solid-solution alloys . X-ray diffraction patterns give us the distances between interplanar spacings of molecules and atoms . These data should permit us to accurately produce a photographic representation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedure was originally pro-posed by W. L. Bragg . The diffraction spots are assigned indices denoting the orientations of the reflecting planes of the atom relative to the unit cell . Intensities are measured and correc tions applied to arrive at certain structure factors which , however , are independent of the crystal structure . In the second step , successive exposures are made on a single film through a number of special masks consisting of films on which there are previously prepared patterns of various widths , spacings , and orientations . The masks used are determined by the indices of the X-ray diffraction spots and the structure factors which also control the // relative lengths of exposure . The photograph obtained after the multiple exposure shows the structure of the molecule or atom . A molecule of hexamethylbenzene magnified about 50,000,000 times is shown in Fig. 5-25 . The carbon atoms are indicated clearly , but the hydrogen atoms , of which there are 3 to each of the 6 carbon atoms of the outer ring , do not show because their diffracting power for X rays is negligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is precisely that previously deduced by organic chemists . Although the finished picture is not a simple print through a negative , the mathematical steps // involved in obtaining from the X-ray diffraction pattern the information about the band patterns to use , and the exposure times through each , satisfy rigorously the laws of physics . The final result can , therefore , be said to represent a true picture of the actual molecular structure . 5-9 . Field-emission X-ray Tube A tungsten-filament emitter is entirely inadequate to supply the electron current to produce the high-intensity X-ray beam required for exposures of only a few microseconds . This limita tion has been removed by the development of a field-emission X-ray tube , which consists of a cold-cathode emitter , a discharge-initiating electrode , and a tungsten anode , acting as the target , mounted in an evacuated envelope . The cathode is a small rectangular piece of molybdenum ar ranged within a slot of a trough-shaped auxiliary electrode which also acts as a focusing cup . As may be seen from the schematic circuit diagram , Fig. 5-26 , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high resistance R2 . During operation , the sharp edges on the anode , located close to the cathode M , concentrate the electric field , and a discharge is initiated which is then forced by the voltage drop across the high resistance to transfer to the anode . A very large but brief burst of power of approximately 600,000 kilowatts is supplied by a Marx-circuit surge generator shown to the right of the tube . The rectifier tubes V1 and V2 charge each of six capacitors C to a potential of 50 kilovolts through a group of resistors . The individual spark gaps G2 and the special // gap G3 arc adjusted just below the point of voltage breakdown . Capacitor C2 in the trigger circuit is charged to about 1000 volts . When the switch S is closed the charge on the grid of V4 in the timer circuit is dissipated , and C2 then discharges through the primary winding of the induction coil T2 . The secondary winding delivers a high-voltage impulse to initiate a flashover at the spark gap G3 , causing all the gaps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total output potential of all the capacitors C in series , that is , 300 kilovolts , is impressed on the tube electrodes M and N. The high field causes electrons to be emitted from the cathode , and the discharge of the capacitors develops into an arc between the cathode and the focusing anode and then immediately thereafter to the anode , with the consequent production of high-intensity X rays . The high stabilizing resistance R1 is connected across the cathode and the anode to facilitate consistent firing . A surge generator with X-ray tube is illustrated in Fig. 5-27 . The timing circuit may be adjusted to produce a time interval ranging from 20 to several thousand microseconds . With slight changes , the circuit may be arranged to cause operation when the switch S is opened instead of closed , and exposures of this kind are made when the object under observation is used to break a conducting lead . The series of radiographs of a golf ball starting its flight , shown in Fig. 5-28 , was made with such a timer connection . X-ray equipment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is helpful in the solution of many mechanical problems , such as the determination of strains in the blades of steam and gas turbines and the analysis of valve action in reciprocating engines . 5-10 . Artificial Radioactivity Other large special-purpose vacuum tubes , installed mainly in research laboratories , contribute to the extension of our knowledge of atomic structure and make available other important research tools . These devices resemble electric generators in size and with their auxiliary apparatus look like power plants . Their development dates from about the time of the discovery of X rays , when A. H. Becquerel noted that invisible radiation , termed radioactivity , was emitted spontaneously by various uranium compounds . Later P. and M. S. Curie verified this action on a number of the heavy elements and discovered the radioactive elements polonium and radium . Subsequent analysis disclosed that this radiation consists of three components , designated as alpha , beta , and gamma rays ; these were later identified as positive ions or nuclei of helium , high-speed electrons , and extremely short electromagnetic waves , respectively . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tubes active substance gradually disintegrates into an clement of lower atomic weight and number . Radium of atomic number 88 , for instance , passes through at least ten distinct forms before it reaches stability as lead with an atomic number 82 . Some transmutations are accompanied by the emission of alpha par ticles , and others by the simultaneous emission of beta particles and gamma rays . The time required to convert one-half the substance , termed its half-life , varies from 1690 years for the change of radium to radon to only 3 minutes for the change of radium A to radium B. The rate of disintegration is propor tional to the remaining number of original particles of the radioactive substance , and the disintegration time varies log arithmically as given by the equation where 11fo is the initial mass , M is the mass at a subsequent time t , e is the Napierian base , and 8 is the decay constant of the substance . Alpha particles are ejected with very high velocities and are able to ionize air and pass through thin metal foil or sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of these nearly reach the speed of light , but because they are so much lighter than the alpha particles they are more easily deflected during collisions with air atoms . Gamma rays are extremely penetrating radiations and have wavelengths which range from about 0.005 to 1 angstrom unit . They are utilized in medical therapy and in industrial radiography . Two typical gamma radiographs taken through thick steel castings are illustrated in Fig. 5-29 . Artificial transmutation of an element was achieved by E. Rutherford in 1919 by bombarding nitrogen with alpha par ticles and causing protons or hydrogen nuclei to be driven from the nuclei of nitrogen . This astounding discovery received an additional impetus in 1934 when I. and F. Curie Joliot announced the production of an artificial radioactive substance obtained by bombarding aluminum with high-speed alpha particles . The relative scarcity and high cost of radium coupled with the paucity of alpha particles for large-scale experiments caused the development of electrical apparatus to accelerate large numbers of helium ions or , preferably , deuterons . Deuterons are the // nuclei of deuterium , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atomic weight of 2 . The necessary acceleration is obtained by impressing a large difference of potential between the two electrodes of a vacuum tube , liberating the positively charged or ionized particles at the anode , and having them proceed to the cathode where they act on a suitable target material . Many problems are involved in the construction of a linear accelerator ; the required voltage may range up to several mega-volts , and the associated insulation problems are complex . An interesting research laboratory installation is illustrated in Fig. 5 ? 30 ; it is shown partially sectionalized in Fig. 5 ? 31 . The 47-foot high pear-shaped pressure vessel mounted on the build ing contains a high-voltage generator and a special vacuum tube . A Van de Graaff electrostatic generator , consisting of an endless fabric belt that acquires a positive charge at the low portion of its travel from a vacuum-tube rectifier , carries the charge to the top , and delivers it to the high-potential terminal , supplies the requisite accelerating voltage . The apparatus , enThe // closed in the tank with gas under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained without flashover , and this potential difference can be applied to the terminals of the 40-foot vacuum tube . Protons , deuterons , or alpha particles , released at the top , are accelerated in their travel down the tube and bom bard the desired target to produce artificial radioactivity or to effect transmutations. 5-11 . The Cyclotron and Betatron Slightly more than a decade ago E. O. Lawrence developed the cyclotron , a device that accelerates ionized particles by giving them a group of periodic impulses as they travel within two cylindrical sections of an evacuated chamber . The cutaway view , Fig. 5-32 , shows an electromagnet arranged to contain the acceleration chamber between its pole faces . Two hollow , semi-circular , D-shaped electrodes , slightly separated from each other // and insulated , are mounted in the chamber and connected to a high-frequency vacuum-tube oscillator . An electron emitter is located at the center of the chamber and arranged so that it causes ionization of a small quantity of hydrogen , deuterium , or helium which may be injected at that point . A positively charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the momentarily negatively charged electrode and because of the magnetic field assumes a circular path . At the moment it emerges the polarity between the electrodes changes and another semicircular excursion takes place . The electric field in the mean-time accelerates the ion , and the circular path is modified into a spiral path of gradually increasing diameter until the particle finally emerges from an opening at the edge of one of the elec trodes . The final energy resident in the ion is equal to the energy acquired in passing from one electrode to the other multi-plied by the total number of passages between them . Even though individual ions within the chamber travel longer or shorter paths , depending on their distance from the center , all reach the edge of an electrode at the same time , and , therefore , for a given magnetic field intensity , the impulses on each ion can be synchronized with the frequency of the oscillating electric field . The time t required for an ion to move through the semiThe Cyclotron and Betatron 207 circular path of one electrode is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velocity . The mechanical deflecting force of an ion having a charge e and moving at a velocity v in a constant magnetic field of intensity H is equal to Hev . The centripetal force of the ion of mass m , which has a value of mv2/r , is equal to the deflecting force , or From this we see that and that r and v are directly proportional ; that is , an ion traveling in an outer orbit has a greater speed than one nearer the center . Substituting the value for r/v in Eq . 5-6 , we obtain which gives the value of t as independent of the radius of the path . Magnetic field intensity and the radius of curvature govern the velocity . The kinetic energy IV in joules residing in an ion of mass in kilograms as it leaves the acceleration chamber at a radius r meters is The first cyclotron had magnetic pole faces 5 inches in diameter , and a later model was then constructed with this dimension increased to 28 inches . The latter , built around a 75-ton magnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an energy of 4,000,000 electron volts . Dimensions and output of subsequent cyclotrons were still further increased , and in 1948 a huge device containing an electromagnet with pole pieces 184 inches in diameter and weighing about 4000 tons was constructed . With a 50-kilovolt potential across the acceleration chamber this cyclotron is able to accelerate deuterons to energies of 200,000,000 // electron volts and alpha particles to twice this amount . This energy enables the particles to penetrate the nuclei of atoms , causing nuclear fragmentation and the generation of cosmic rays . The acceleration chamber is illustrated in Fig. 5-33 , and a view of the device , which provides an index of the size of the electromagnet , is shown in Fig. 5-34 . The rotating capacitor , by producing a varying capacity at a modulation rate of a few hundred times per second , varies by about 20 per cent the oscillator frequency , which is in the neighborhood of 10 mega-cycles per second . This feature makes possible the circumven tion of the limitations imposed by the relativistic effect , which are encountered at high velocities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energies . From this method of opera tion is derived the term frequency-modulated cyclotron or synchro-cyclotron . When beryllium is bombarded with high-speed deuterons , the beryllium disintegrates into boron , and neutrons are liberated which , in turn , may be used to bombard other substances . A net // result of bombardment by various particles , including neutrons , has been the production of more than 350 radioelements or isotopes during the last decade . A typical example is provided by radiophosphorus 131 ' 32 , which can be produced by bombarding 16532 with neutrons , 15P " with deuterons , or 14S29 with alpha particles . Radiophosphorus emits only beta particles , its half-life is 14.3 days , and the end product is the stable element sulphur 16S ' ' 2 . Since a radioactive isotope is chemically identical to the ordinary element of the same atomic weight , it may be used as an economical substitute for radium in medical radiation treat ments or as a tracer element . For example , a small quantity of an artificially produced soluble radioactive element may be added to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced by determining the presence of the emitted particles or rays . A new instrument , termed a betatron , has been constructed , which produces electromagnetic radiations of even greater pene210 Special-purpose Vacuum Tubes Crating power than the X rays emitted by the 2,000,000-volt unit described in Sec. 5=7 . This electron accelerator , originally developed by D. NV . Kerst , is built similar to a transformer and contains a laminated magnetic circuit with pole faces and magnetizing coils ( I ( signed for low-frequency a-c operation . A glass tube , composed of sectors made with a conducting layer of silver on the inside to prevent the disturbing effect of accumulated charges and cemented together , is located within a larger doughnut-shaped vacuum tube mounted between the pole faces . An electron gun projects into the inner tube and emits electrons which are accelerated uniformly and move in a spiral path during that portion of the cycle when the magnetic field is in the proper direction . At the end of their travel , they strike a target and produce electromagnetic radiation . In the 100,000,000-volt model , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electron volts for every excursion around the // tube and are accelerated almost to the speed of light . The result ing electromagnetic radiation of extremely short wavelengths lies in the range of gamma and cosmic rays . 5-12 . The Mass Spectrometer The mass spectrometer is an instrument wherein a gas is ionized and segregated into streams of different masses which are measured both qualitatively and quantitatively . Chemical analysis by the separation of positive ions is not new . It was proposed and used by J. J. Thomson many years ago , but more recent developments , such as simplified methods of obtaining a high vacuum , high-gain amplifiers , and unusually well-regulated a-c and d-c voltages , have aided in converting this purely scientific device into an important analytical production instrument in the petroleum , tire , and general chemical industries . A small quantity of the gas to be analyzed in the mass spec trometer passes through the end portion of a high-vacuum tube and is ionized by electrons emitted from a heated filament , as indicated in the simplified sketch of Fig. 5-36 . The ions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slit in the anode , and are then made to travel in a circular path through the action // of a magnetic field . Specific ions , having been deflected a definite amount , pass through an exit slit near the end of the tube , strike a plate , and give up their charge . This charge is amplified , and its magnitude is a direct index of the number of ions that reach the plate . For a certain magnetic field intensity // and a given accelerating voltage , the mass of an ion determines whether it passes through the exit slit or strikes the conducting side wall of the tube . Ions of light mass follow a path with a small radius of curvature ; those with a heavier mass follow one with a larger radius . By changing the fields the successive ion streams of different masses are made to strike the target elec trode , and their charges are measured after amplification . Figure 5-37 , which illustrates the internal construction of the instrument , shows how the magnetic field can be changed simply and easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ac curately known proportions through the tube , adjusting the fields so that each component in succession is focused on the exit slit , and the current for each fraction is measured . Only one com position needs to be analyzed , and from this , extensions may be // made in the calibration to cover mixtures of various proportions . Extremely minute quantities of any substance in a mixture may be detected ; determinations of as little as 1 part of oxygen in 10,000 parts of nitrogen are well within the range of the instrument . In a complex molecule , such as normal butane , containing a large number of component atoms , many masses are present and the entire mass spectrum may be determined both qualitatively and quantitatively . Figure 5 ? 38 is the striking illustration of a mass spectrometer sorting molecules of three different masses . Detection of vacuum leaks becomes very much simplified if gas from the evacuated system is passed through the spectrometer . A tiny jet of helium gas is played over any suspected area , and , with proper adjustment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leak is indicated quickly on the output meter . The instrument registers as little as 1 part of helium in 400,000 parts of air at an operating pressure of 0.3 micron of mercury . Problems 1 .

What advantages , if any , do these tubes have over vacuum tubes in this specific circuit ? A cyclotron is equipped with a magnet having pole faces 28 inches in diameter . The acceleration chamber has a diameter of 22 inches and is connected to a 20,000-volt 10-megacycle oscillator . The field intensity is adjusted to accelerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ? 27 kilogram . What is the kinetic energy of the bombarding ions in equivalent electron volts ? In the mass-spectrometer circuit , Fig. 5-36 , explain in detail the necessity for ( a ) the alternating voltage regulator in the magnet supply circuit , and ( b ) the alternating voltage regulator in the ion-accelerating voltage supply circuit . 6- Gas-filled Tubes Gas-filled tubes contain an atmosphere of an inert gas or mercury vapor , and because of this they are endowed with characteristics entirely different from those of the previously discussed vacuum tubes . The latter have a high and variable tube resistance , a relatively small anode current , and a grid that exercises complete control over the anode current ; gas-filled tubes have a very low and nearly constant tube resistance , an anode current limited only by the load impedance , and grid control confined only to the initiation of the current flow through the tube . The response time of gas-filled tubes is much slower than that of vacuum tubes ; nevertheless , it is extremely rapid compared to the half-period of a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas-filled tubes cause them to find their greatest application as switching devices in power circuits . We shall consider some of these tubes that range in size from small measurement and flash tubes to the large metalenclosed units that are an important part of central-station and power-plant equipment . 6-1 . The Geiger Counter Some of the properties of gas-filled tubes were mentioned in Sec. 1-6 . Factors that determine ionization and consequent conduction in a gas diode are the shape , composition , and placement of the electrodes , the nature and pressure of the gas , the operating temperature , and the value of the applied voltage . In 1908 H. Geiger developed a simple cold-cathode gas-filled tube which depends on an external source of ionized particles or ioniz-217 // ing radiation to initiate a current flow within the tube . Early tubes were erratic in their action , and later Geiger with A. Muller improved the design and stabilized the performance . Basically , a Geiger-Muller tube consists of a gas-filled envelope which contains a cylindrical cathode that surrounds an axially arranged fine wire anode . Either a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ionizing particles or radiation . The operation depends on the formation of one or more ion pairs . Each liberated electron , in turn , produces other ions that cause a momentary change in the potential and a voltage pulse across the terminals of the tube . Structural or circuit means quench the discharge after an event and restore the tube to its original nonconducting condition . The general characteristics of a Geiger-Muller tube are shown in Fig. 6 ? 1 ; a schematic sketch and simplified circuit of a Geiger counter are given in Fig. 6 ? 2 . It will be noted from the voltage // characteristic that no ionization occurs with a low voltage applied to the tube , but when the voltage is increased the electrical field within the tube imparts sufficient energy to the electrons so that ions are formed . Throughout the voltage range A ? B , each original electron causes the formation of successive ion pairs within a few thousandths of an inch of the surface of the central wire . The dissociated electrons reach the anode quickly , but the heavier positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathode , and , consequently , a positive ion sheath is formed around the anode . As the positive ions move toward the cylindrical cathode , the wire becomes more and more negatively charged until the potential reaches a maximum value , as shown in Fig. 6 ? 1(a) . The magnitude of the voltage pulse in the proportional region A ? B is a function of the number of the original ionizing particles or the quanta of the ionizing radiation . After the voltage between the anode and the cathode , including the interelectrodc capacitance ( ' between them , has reached its maximum value , it decreases exponentially by leakage of the charge through the resistor R. the rate being determined by the time constant RC . The potential difference between the cathode and the anode is ultimately restored to its original value , but in the meantime the voltage pulse or count has been transmitted through the capacitor C1 to the indicator . With a still higher applied voltage , the field between the electrodes causes dissociated electrons to ionize outlying gas molecules and also to produce ionizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field strength between the electrodes soon reaches a point where ionization can no longer be maintained . In the meantime a voltage pulse , essentially similar in shape to those produced throughout the proportional region but with a practically constant amplitude irrespective of the magnitude of the initiating stimulus , is produced . A tube operated within this voltage range C ? D of the curve is termed a Geiger counter . If still higher voltages , indicated at E on the voltage curve , are applied to the tube , continuous discharge takes place . Ordinarily tubes are filled with a gas , such as argon or krypton , at pressures which range from about 100 millimeters of mercury to nearly atmospheric pressure . In some designs the gas mixture is modified by the addition of several per cent of oxygen , and // often a small quantity of a complex gas or vapor , such as ethyl alcohol , is added to assist in obtaining self-quenching action . Envelopes for Geiger-Muller tubes are made of glass or metal , and the windows are designed for the specific use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a high transparency for radiation within the wavelength range of 0.5 to 2.2 angstrom units , is commonly used in X-ray diffraction work . Tubes are also made with windows of beryllium or thin sheets of mica ; these are necessary for the transmission of the longer-wavelength X rays . A monochromatic X-ray beans composed of the K radiations , emitted by a copper , cobalt , iron , or chromium target , is almost completely absorbed in its passage through an argonfilled tube , while krypton acts similarly for the major K radiation emitted by a molybdenum target . These tubes are capable of detecting in excess of 3000 X-ray quanta per second , and form the foundation for an intensity meter since the number of quanta is a function of the intensity of X radiation . An important analytical and research instrument known as a Geiger-counter X-ray spectrometer is obtained by combining such a tube with X-ray diffraction equipment . Early Geigercounter spectrometers were arranged so that the tube , mounted on a pivoted arm , scanned the arc normally covered by the film and indicated the relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent model , illustrated in Fig. 6-3 , specimen and counter rotate about a common axis ; the specimen holder rotates at one-half the angular velocity of the counter scanning arm . The scale is calibrated from 0 ? to 90 ? , and mechanical precision permits a dial micrometer to indicate accurately angles as small as 0.01 ? . The recording meter in the Geiger-counter output circuit not only registers the presence of the diffracted X rays but also measures their intensity . Frequently , only an indication from a single line is required for inspection or production control , and , therefore , scanning in those cases can be confined to observations within a few degrees . Applications of the instrument include such diversified uses as the identification of silicates and phosphates in boiler scale , checking of the composition of clays and other raw materials , and the rapid determination of high-molecular-weight organic materials , such as cholestorol and rotenone . A Geiger-Muller tube can also be made to respond to neutrons // by filling it with boron trifluoride gas . If the nucleus of a boron atom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released , and this , in turn , initiates the ionization within the tube . 6-2 . Flash Tubes In 1932 H. E. Edgerton and K. J. Germeshausen developed the first of a number of tubes and circuits that operate on the principle of slowly charging a capacitor to a high voltage and then at an appropriate time applying an ionizing stimulus that causes // the capacitor to discharge through the tube within an extremely short period of time . Tubes of this type are known as flash tubes because the discharge is accompanied by an intense lightninglike flash of light . A flash tube consists of a long helix of glass or quartz tubing , equipped with electrodes at each end , as shown in Fig. 6-4 . It is filled with either mercury vapor or xenon . Helical tub ing makes for compactness and by being enclosed within an outer bulb prevents break-age and provides safety in handling . In some designs one end of the helix is left open , with one electrode mounted within the outer envelope and with gas in both the helix and outer envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprises two parts , the power supply and the flash gun . The power supply charges the large capaci tor Cs to a high voltage by means of the two rectifier tubes VI and V2 which are connected in a voltage-doubler circuit . A wire or foil elec-trode , placed on the outside of the flash tube V3 near the cathode is connected to the secondary winding of an igni-Lion coil T2 . After the closure of switch S1 , the capacitor C3 is charged to the high voltage and the capacitor C4 is charged to about 60 volts by the voltage drop across the resistor R2 . When next the switch S3 is closed , the charge on C4 passes through the primary winding of transformer T2 , and the // resulting induced voltage in the secondary winding produces an electric field that ionizes the gas and initiates the capacitor discharge . The discharge current of the capacitor through the flash lamp reaches a maximum of several thousand amperes , and there is an intense blue-white flash of light . Peak light output for the discharge of a 120-microfarad capacitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the effective flash duration is approximately 200 microseconds . A capacitor charging time of about 15 seconds is required between successive flashes . The tube has a long life ; more than 10,000 flashes may be obtained under normal operating conditions . High operating voltages demand good insulation , and a switch S2 is provided as a safety device to discharge the capacitor if the unit requires service or is removed from the case . A pilot light indicates that the apparatus is in an operative condition . Although flash durations of several hundred microseconds are ample for arresting ordinary motions , exposures involving high speeds , for instance those of projectile flights , require illumina tions of only a few microseconds . The flash time can be re duced by specially designed lamps and small capacitors charged to very high voltages . Equipment of this type is available which provides a high-intensity flash of only 2 microseconds . During that time an object moving at the rate of 1000 feet per second is displaced less than 0.01 inch . Many obscure facts of nature become known when successive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // startling effect of aerated water in clinging to a body is illustrated in Fig. 6-6 . In passing through a faucet attachment , shown sectionalized in Fig. 6-7 , screens divide the stream of water into jets and air is drawn in through side openings and is mixed with the water to produce the aerated water stream . The explanation as to why aerated water clings to a surface , and normal water issuing from a faucet does not , is left to the reader . 6-3 . Grid-glow and Trigger Tubes An electrode or grid located in close proximity to the cathode within a gas tube may be used to start or prevent ionization . These cold-cathode tubes are termed grid-glow or trigger tubes . The typical construction , illustrated in Fig. 6-8(a) , shows the cathode as an oxide-coated inverted saucer-like electrode through the center of which the wire anode projects from an insulated glass tube . A wire ring placed between the anode and the cathode acts as the control electrode . When a suitable mo- // mentary potential is applied between the grid and the cathode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trans ferred to the anode , provided that the anode is at a sufficiently high positive potential with respect to the cathode . If a pair of contacts on a relay in the anode circuit are connected so as to open the anode circuit after the relay is energized , the tube is restored to its original nonconducting condition . Breakdown Breakdown may occur be-tween any two electrodes of a grid-glow tube , and tubes are often operated with posi-tive voltages on the grid , in which event there is a dis-charge and grid current flows . A critical anode voltage exists at which breakdown occurs with zero grid current , but when the grid voltage is in-creased so as to cause grid current , the critical anode voltage is reduced , as shown in the transition characteristic Fig. 6-9(a) . At any anode voltage above the critical value , the discharge is transferred from the cathode and grid to the cathode and anode . The anode characteristic obtained with resistors in both grid and anode circuits , and connected to a 60-cycle supply line , is given in Fig. 6-9(b) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains practically constant over a considerable range , as it does in voltage-regulator tubes , and also that the tube can be used as a rectifier because of the asymmetrical shape of the curve . The main discharge within a grid-glow tube is accompanied by emission of light . A tube of this general type for use as a stroboscopic light source , and known as a strobotron , was de veloped by K. J. Germeshausen and H. E. Edgerton . It consists of a neon-filled tube containing a cold cathode coated with a // low-work-function material . As shown in Fig. 6-8(b) , a control grid and a screen grid are located between the cathode and the voltage , is connected between the cathode and the anode , and voltages are applied to the grids to prevent breakdown . When the potential between the two grids reaches a critical value , // ionization of the gas takes place , the initial discharge between the grids transfers itself to the cathode and the anode , and the capacitor discharges with a resulting brilliant flash of light . The frequency of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being about 240 pulses per second . 6-4 . The Strobotac The Strobotac , illustrated in Fig. 6-10 , consists of a portable instrument incorporating a strobotron tube , a power supply , and a multivibrator . The instrument , during use , is directed so that a periodic illumination is thrown on a rotating or vibrating object under observation . A multiposition switch permits the selection of low or high flashing rates , triggered either by the variable228 Gas-filled Tubes frequency multivibrator or by an external contactor , an off position , or a position at which the flashing rate occurs in synchronism with the power-supply frequency . The flashing rate of the multivibrator , which may be varied between the limits of 600 and 14,400 flashes per minute , can be ascertained from the scale just above the frequency adjusting dial . The instrument is calibrated for the two ranges by checking the illumination on a line-frequency-operated vibrating reed located near the tube and then adjusting the flashing rates until the reed appears motion-less . The circuit diagram of the instrument , Fig. 6-11 , may be divided into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectifier tube VI , the multivibrator centered around the twin triode V2a and Vab , and the strobotron V3 . The rectifier charges the capacitor C6 through the resistor R11i and this voltage is impressed between the anode and the cathode of the strobotron . The tube , however , can not conduct until ionization takes place between the two grids . The screen grid is given a positive potential with respect to the control grid , which is at cathode potential , by being connected in the voltage-divider circuit R1 and R14 , but this potential is not sufficient to cause ionization . Each time the triode Vmb conducts , or if the switch // S3 is thrown to the external contactor and its terminals are shortcircuited , the capacitor C8 , which is charged to the rectified voltage through resistors R1 , R4 , R , 0 , and R12i discharges through R12 and reduces the potential at the control grid to a sufficiently negative value so that ionization occurs between the two grids . This , of course , produces the main discharge of capacitor C , ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time C6 recharges , the open-circuit condition for C8 is re-established , it too is recharged , and the original condition is restored . Switch S4 connects an additional capacitor C7 in the main discharge circuit when the instrument is used on low flashing rates ; the added capacitance causes a more intense flash of light and makes the illumination the same for low and high flashing rates . The multivibrator circuit is in general similar to the one shown in Fig. 3-30 . The rate of discharge of capacitors C4 and C9 through the dial-operated potentiometer R2 controls the oscilla230 Gas-filled Tubes tion periodicity for high flashing rates ; the two switches , labeled S2i connect capacitors Ca and Cio in parallel with C ' 4 and C9 , respectively , for low flashing rates . Calibration adjustments are made by altering the values of resistors R ; ; and R. The Strobotac is perhaps best known for its application as a tachometer and for its use as an exploring tool in vibration analysis . If the speed of a motor rotor or other rotating object varies enough to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be connected to a cam arrangement on the rotating shaft , and , since the flash occurs at the moment when the leads are short-circuited , a steady image results . For instance , the occurrence of the spark in an automotive or airplane engine cylinder can be accurately timed , as shown in Fig. 6 ? 12 , by attaching a wire to the spark plug and impressing the ignition voltage on the secondary winding of an ordinary ignition coil , the primary winding of which is connected across the external contactor . The induced voltage in the primary winding initiates the discharge , and the ensuing light flash discloses the angular position of the fly wheel at the instant when ignition takes place . 6 ? 5 . Thyratrons A gas-filled tube with its low internal resistance , requires that the anode current he limited , and the anode voltage must be reduced below the ionization voltage of the gas to interrupt the current flow . A capacitor discharging through a cold-cathode flash tube causes a large anode current to flow because of the absence of a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very short interval during which the capacitor voltage drops to a value no longer able to maintain ionization . To increase the average output of a gas-filled tube , it is necessary to use either a thermionic or a mercury-pool cathode to supply the requisite number of electrons ; to exercise firing control requires the introduction of a control grid . The thyrntron , developed by A. W. Hull and his associates , consists of a hot-cathode gas-filled tube in which one or more electrodes are used to control electrostatically the initiation or starting of a unidirectional current flow between the cathode and the anode . Cathode and anode constructions for gas-filled tubes were described in Secs . 2 ? 5 and 2-6 . Precautions are taken in the design to prevent uncontrollable ionization by enclosing the // leads within the tube and by surrounding the cathode or anode , or both , with a metallic shield . This isolates these electrodes except for one or more openings in the grid through which the normal discharge takes place . Sectionalized views of a simple three-electrode thyratron and one incorporating a shield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fig. 6-13 . In the shield-grid thyratron both cathode and anode are placed in separate compartments within the shield structure , and an aperture in the shield partition provides an opening for the discharge . Figure 6 ? 14 illustrates two hydrogen-filled thyratrons which are charac terized by the advantages of low ionization times and high peak currents . A simple thyratron circuit has a load resistor in the anode circuit and a relatively high-valued resistor in the grid circuit . The grid-circuit resistor is used because positive ions move toward the negatively charged grid during discharge , and this results in , a grid current . For a given direct or alternating peak anode voltage , the grid potential of a specific thyratron must be reduced to a critical value before the tube conducts or fires . This is demonstrated in Fig. 6 ? 1510 . A number of control curves , taken at various temperatures , are given because the tube is temperature sensitive , being filled with mercury vapor ; the com panion curve Fig. 6 ? 15 ( b ) is obtained from a thyratron filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any grid voltage to the right of a given control curve causes the // tube to fire . Increasing the grid voltage to a more negative value while the discharge is in progress is ineffective in controlling or extinguishing the discharge because positive ions are attracted toward the grid , surround it , and form a positive-ion sheath . It is only after the anode voltage is reduced below the ionization value that the discharge ceases , the ions recombine to make neutral atoms , and the grid loses its positive sheath , permitting it to regain control . Ionization and deionization do not occur instantly ; the time interval varies with such factors as the gas or vapor pressure , the ambient temperature , and the applied voltage . In general the ionization time extends over only a few microseconds , but the deionization time is much longer . In some tubes it extends over several hundred microseconds , and , therefore , thyratrons can be operated only on a-c circuits of relatively low frequencies . For the frequencies normally encountered in electric power applicaLions , ionization times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for deionization requires only a small portion of the time after the positive portion of the cycle drops below the ionization voltage and during the initial part of the negative portion of the cycle . It must not be assumed that thyratrons are made to operate only with negative grid voltages ; some are designed to fire when // the control grid reaches a definite positive potential with respect to the cathode , but tubes of this type are generally made with a shield grid . The control characteristics of a shield-grid thyratron filled with argon , given in Fig. 6-16 , indicate that the voltage of the screen grid affects the critical voltage of the control grid . If an a-c power supply is connected in the anode circuit of a thyratron , the instantaneous anode voltage varies sinusoidally . During the positive portion of the cycle the tube may or may not conduct , depending on the voltage of the control grid ; during the negative portion of the cycle it can not conduct , irrespective of the grid potential , since this involves electron flow from the anode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in conjunction with the positive lobe of a sinusoidal voltage to construct the control locus , as indicated in Fig. 6-17 , by deter-mining the magnitude of the critical grid voltage required to prevent the tube from firing for various direct or peak alternating anode voltages and plotting these values below the anode-voltage lobe . The construction shows that the tube can conduct only if the grid voltage is less negative than the values given by the control locus . For example , if the tube whose control locus is // shown in the figure is supplied with a constant grid voltage of -3 volts no conduction occurs , but if the grid voltage is reduced to - 2.5 volts the tube fires at the maximum anode voltage and continues to conduct to the end of the positive portion of the cycle . With a grid voltage of -2 volts , the discharge is initiated when the anode voltage is about 80 volts . In other words , the tube starts conducting at that positive anode voltage where the grid voltage intersects the control locus . Obviously , a direct grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in phase with the anode voltage , can initiate conduction only during the first half of the positive voltage alternation . However , as we shall see in the next section , other methods and circuits have been devised to make the tube fire at any desired point within the half cycle . The control locus in the figure is drawn for the entire positive voltage lobe ; that is , it covers 180 ? . Actually , of course , conduction through the gas or vapor takes place only when the anode voltage is in excess of the ionization potential of the particular gas or vapor in the tube . 6 ? 6 . Phase-shifting Methods When an alternating voltage is supplied to the anode and a voltage in excess of the critical value to cause breakdown is applied to the control grid of a thyratron , the instantaneous anode current ib in amperes during discharge is given by the expression where Em is the maximum value of the applied voltage , f is the frequency in cycles per second , t is the time in seconds after beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube , and R is the load resistance in ohms . If the tube is operated on ordinary power circuits , the value of E0 is quite small and for purposes of simplification is assumed to be zero in the following discussion of control circuits . This also postulates that the tube continues to conduct to the very end of a positive half-cycle instead of only to the phase angle determined by the ionization potential of the gas within the tube ; for conduction throughout the entire half-cycle a similar , very small nonconducting interval at the beginning of the cycle is also neglected . Of course , in actual operation the value of E0 // is important and must be considered , particularly in efficiency calculations . The problem of thyratron control resides in having the grid voltage intersect the control locus at any position throughout 180 ? while the anode is at a positive voltage . The average current Iu , , from the instant of conduction to the end of the half-cycle may be obtained by integrating Eq . 6 ? 1 between limits of angles , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base . Thus , we get where B , termed the starting angle , may vary between the limits of 0 and 7T radians . For full-wave rectification and control that uses two tubes , as will be shown in later circuits , the average rectified current is twice that given above and represents the direct current Ide as indicated on a d-c ammeter , or This shows that , for given values of maximum alternating voltage and load resistance , the rectified direct current varies as the cosine of the starting angle ; the numerical value of the quantity in the parentheses ranges between 0 and 2 . The direct current varies almost linearly with respect to starting angles between 60 ? and 120 ? , and consequently thyratrons are widely used to operate and control d-c motors on a-c power sources . A simple and very effective method of controlling the starting angle on an a-c operated thyratron consists in supplying the grid with an alternating voltage , the phase angle of which may be varied with respect to the anode voltage . The bridge circuit of Fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuits that have been devised to produce a phase shift of nearly 180 ? . The circuit utilizes a capacitor , which has a reactance Xe at the operating frequency , two fixed resistors , and a variable resistor . The corresponding voltage vector diagram is shown in Fig. 6 ? 18(b) . A suitable alternating voltage is impressed on the input terminals , and if , for convenience in analysis , the resistances of R , and R2 are made equal , the output voltage V2 is equal to one-half the input voltage Vn . As the resistance of R is changed from an // extremely high value to zero , the I2R vector is turned counterclockwise and the angle 0 , which represents the phase displacement between the output and the input voltages , increases from just beyond 0 ? to nearly 180 ? . Resistors RI and R2 are often replaced , as shown in Fig. 6-19(a) , by a tapped transformer winding which also supplies the operating voltage . Resistor RL represents the load in the anode circuit , and RG is placed in the grid circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid is at a positive potential with respect to the cathode . With R at its maximum value , the phase angle of the alternating grid voltage is nearly 180 ? out of phase with the anode voltage and does not // intersect the control locus . As the value of R is reduced the phase difference between the anode and grid voltage is also reduced , as illustrated in Fig. 6 ? 19(b) , causing the grid voltage to cross the control locus , and a discharge occurs which continues to the end of the half-cycle . Gradual and continuous control of the thyratron firing position during nearly 180 ? of the positive half-cycle may be achieved by the variation of R. If R and C are interchanged , the anode and grid voltages are 180 ? out of phase with R at zero . When the value of R for this ease is increased , conduction occurs at the beginning of the half-cycle and firing control can not be obtained because the grid voltage always remains above the control locus . Inductive reactance may be used instead of capacitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For instance , the capacitor C in Fig. 6 ? 19 ( a ) may be replaced with the variable resistor and R may be replaced with an inductor . As the value of the variable resistor is increased , the phase angle of the grid voltage is advanced from the out-of-phase position and the average current through the tube is gradually increased . As in the previous example , when these two circuit elements are interchanged , that is , when the inductor occupies the position held by the capacitor C , and if the variable resistor remains as shown in the diagram , the phase between the two voltages is retarded as the value of the resistor is decreased , the current reaches full value immediately , and control becomes impossible . The crossover between the grid voltage and the control locus is steeper in some phase positions than in others . Clearly , the steeper the intersection between the two , the more definite the current-initiating position . Frequently circuits are encountered where the alternating grid voltage is superimposed on an adjustable negative direct voltage to obtain steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse lasting only a few milliseconds is used to initiate the discharge . The pulse is obtained from a peaking transformer of the magneticleakage type , shown diagrammatically in Fig. 6 ? 20 ( a ) . One leg of the transformer core is made of Permalloy , and the grid excitation winding is placed on this leg . The Permalloy core reaches magnetic saturation early in each alternation , after which the magnetic flux finds a lower-reluctance path through the central portion of the magnetic circuit . Alternate positive and // negative voltage pulses of short duration are induced in the grid excitation winding during the time the flux passes through a small range near the zero values . In order to obtain a shift in the starting angle of the voltage pulse , a constant but adjustable magnetic flux is superimposed on the alternating flux by passing a direct current through control windings placed adjacent to the main transformer winding . As illustrated in Fig. 6-20(b) , a constant magnetic flux in one direction produces a lag in the position of the voltage pulse , and a constant magnetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulse with respect to the position it occupies when no constant flux is present in the core . The anode potential is obtained from a separate trans-former , but , since the same power supply is used throughout , accurate phase control of the starting angle is readily obtained . 6-7 . Thyratron Applications A thyratron permits the passage of a large current , and consequently massive relays and circuit connectors can be used in the anode circuit . Since the anode current is interrupted at the end of each cycle of the power supply , and the grid , if sufficiently negative , resumes control , a thyratron circuit can be made to function as a timer throughout an integer number of // cycles . Thyratron timers are employed as switching devices , for sequence control , in welding equipment timing , in motor acceleration , and in process timing controls . A general-purpose timer is illustrated in Fig. 6-21 . The thyratron is located in the center of the panel between two relays , one of which is used for sequence operation and the other for control operations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relays , and the transformer , capacitors , and other components are mounted on the back . The timer circuit , Fig. 6-22 , is of the type which opens or closes a circuit after a predetermined time interval following the // closure of the initiating switch . It operates on the basis of initially impressing a negative voltage on the grid and then applying an adjustable positive voltage , which causes the thyra-tron to conduct . The positive voltage is then gradually reduced , according to a preset rate , until grid control is again re-established . The circuit shows a transformer T , one winding of which sup-plies the filament of the thyratron V ; a second winding provides the anode voltage and is responsible for the relay operation at the proper time ; and a third winding , connected in the grid circuit , forms the basis of the timing control . As shown , the filament of the thyratron is energized and the dry-plate rectifier RE , has charged the capacitor C2 to a negative voltage which prevents the thyratron V from conducting ; it is impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second dry-plate rectifier RE2 , operating in conjunction with an adjustable poten-tiometer PI and a transformer winding , charges capacitor CI through the normally closed relay contacts lo , to a specific voltage . When the switch SI is closed , the relay RYi energizes ; this closes contacts 1b and 1 , and opens contacts 1a . Opening of contacts 1 , // disconnects capacitor CI and removes the charging voltage . Closure of contacts 1 , connects the preselected resistance in parallel with capacitor CI and the extremely high-valued discharge resistor R : ; . The closing of contacts lb connects the positive terminal of the highly charged capacitor CI to the grid of the tube . The tube conducts , and the relay RY2 is energized . Relay contacts 2Q then close and maintain the current flow through RY1 even though the initiating switch is opened . Contacts 2 , , also operate and close the control circuit for the preselected interval . Capacitor CI gradually discharges through the preset value of the resistance R. After a certain interval , depending on the original charge on C1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the resistance R5 , the voltage across CI drops to a value at which the fixed negative voltage from the capacitor C2 again assumes control at the end of a cycle of the supply voltage and the tube ceases to conduct . This causes relay RY2 to de-energize , and the control circuit contacts 2 , open . Contacts 2 , , also open the circuit to relay RY1 , which in turn restores its contacts to the normal inoperative position . Resistor R1 is a grid-current limiting resistor ; the high-valued resistors R2 and R : act as protective discharge resistors for capacitor CI ; and resistor R4. which is connected in parallel to the relay RY2 , acts as a protective means to absorb the magnetic energy stored in the relay when the anode current is interrupted . Over-all accuracy of the timer depends on variations in relay operation , on the characteristics of the capacitors , on the constancy of the other circuit elements , and on the tube . Intervals within 11 cycles are commonly obtained on a 6-cycle interval for a short timing period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 per cent may he obtained at the longer time intervals which may extend up to about 45 seconds . The thyratron , like the gas diode , may be used as a relaxation oscillator . It is commonly applied in the cathode-ray oscilloscope to supply the time base where sweep frequencies up to about 50.000 cycles per second are required . In the basic thyratron relaxation-oscillator circuit , Fig. 6-23(a) , the values of the capacitor C , the resistors R2 and R : ; , and the supply voltage E ? determine the oscillation frequency . The constant grid bias is adjusted so that the tube oscillates at a definite // frequency , but when a synchronizing signal is superimposed on the direct bias the resultant bias is made less negative periodi cally , and breakdown occurs earlier in synchronism with the signal . For the observation of transient phenomena on a cathode-ray oscilloscope equipped with a tube having a long persistence screen , a modification of the previous circuit yields a single sweep . As shown in Fig. 6-231b1 , the circuit utilizes a thyra tron VI and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eonnetted to a potentiometer R4 by means of which the breakdown voltage of the tube may be regulated so that conduction of the diode takes place at an anode voltage just below that at which the thyratron fires . The diode continues to conduct until a positive signal potential is applied to the grid of the thyratron , permitting this tube to fire at the lower anode voltage . Dis charge ceases at the extinction voltage , and capacitor C is re-charged through the series resistor R2 . If the signal voltage has been removed in the meantime , the capacitor again charges to the breakdown voltage of the diode and the thyratron does not fire again . The combination of two thvratrons , one used as a periodically operated single-pole single-throw switch in a pulsing circuit to generate repeated voltage surges , is shown in Fig. 6-24 . Thyra tron VI is of the filamentary type while V2 is indirectly heated ; both receive their cathode heating power from windings on the power transformer T2 . A midtap is used in connection with the filament winding for the tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V2 ; the equipotential cathode of V2 is connected // to one side of the filament . The grid-control rectifier V1 charges capacitor C to a predetermined voltage by the adjustment of the resistor RI in the phase-shifting network . A resistor R2 limits the grid current for tube VI , and R ; performs the same function for tube V2 . The autotransformer T ; ; is shown with a lowvoltage primary winding and a high-voltage secondary winding , although any desired turns ratio may be used , depending on the purpose for which the device is designed . After the cathodes of the tubes have assumed their operating temperatures , the switch S is closed and capacitor C is charged to a definite voltage through tube VI during the positive half-cycle . The lower terminal of C has a positive polarity with respect to the upper terminal . During the charging period , the capacitor can not discharge through the primary winding of trans-former T2 ; and through the tube V2 because the grid of V2 is supplied from a winding on transformer T2 with an alternating voltage which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cathode . During the next alternation of the power-supply voltage , the anode of tube T71 is negative and conduction ceases during that half-cycle , but the grid of tube V2 is positive with respect to its cathode , and the capacitor C discharges through tube V2 and the primary winding of T. ; , resulting in a voltage pulse across the output terminals of the secondary winding . The process occurs once during each cycle of the a-c power supply as long as the switch S remains closed . Circuits of this kind produce adjustable high-voltage pulses for // test purposes . For instance , transformer T : may consist of an automobile ignition coil and the device can then be used for testing spark plugs . In another application , a suitable highvoltage transformer may replace T , ; , and the apparatus supplies repeated surges for the testing of insulation in electrical equipment . 6-8 . The Excitron Mercury-arc rectifiers were developed early in this century and achieved prominence during the expansion of street railways , which require direct current for their operation . Electrolytic reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other electrochemical processes , made additional d-c demands and added to the popularity of the rectifier . Early rectifiers converted single-phase alternating current to direct current by means of an arc between a mercury-pool cathode and carbon anodes located within a glass envelope . The mercury vaporized , later condensed on the cooler walls of the tube , and returned to the pool located at the base of the tube . The two main anodes for a full-wave rectifier were made of carbon or graphite to prevent mercury amalgamation . Initial ionization was obtained by means of a starting anode which consisted of a mercury column that was vaporized by a the tube had been placed in operation . Large multianode steel tank units , like the one shown in Fig. 6-25 , were subsequently developed for use on polyphase circuits . The common mercury-pool cathode is located at the bottom , and the required number of anodes are suspended from the top . Each anode is surrounded by a perforated graphite shield or grid ; this prevents mercury from splashing on the anode and causing it to perform as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regulation is obtained by changing the grid potential . In normal rectifier service the arc current , as illustrated in Fig. 6-26(a) , is commutated from each anode in turn to the anode of the succeeding phase as the voltage on the latter becomes more positive than the one carrying the arc . Arc-current commutation between two phases is not completed instantly ; both anodes carry current simultaneously during a brief overlapping period . The duration of this period depends upon the // inductance of the two transformer phases between which the current is transferred and upon the magnitude of the load current to be commutated . Delayed ignition is accomplished by maintaining a negative blocking voltage on each grid in relation to the cathode until the desired firing point is reached , at which instant a positive voltage is applied to " release " the anode . Rectifier operation with grid-control regulation is illustrated in Fig. // // 6-26(b) . The power factor of a six-phase rectifier may be as high as 0.95 ; it is less than unity because of waveform distortion introduced into the a-c system . Regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power factor in proportion to the cosine of the angle of delay , but in any event , the power factor is always lagging . An important improvement in the field of mercury-arc rectifi cation consisted in the development of a single-anode rectifier , which is equipped with auxiliary electrodes for establishing and controlling the arc current . A group of such individual tanks are assembled to produce a polyphase rectifier termed an Excitron. unit . The advantage of a single unit is that each anode is not exposed to the ionized vapor of the main are current during its nonfiring inverse-voltage period , as it is in a multianode unit . Therefore , the anode may be located much closer to the mercury pool , resulting in a low voltage drop between the electrodes and a correspondingly improved operating efficiency . A cross-sectional view of an individual tank is shown in Fig. // 6-27 . The mercury pool , surrounded by a quartz ring which prevents the cathode spot from traveling up the inside of the tank , is located at the base , and the graphite anode , supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tank , is mounted above it . A graphite grid surrounds the anode , and an excitation anode , which operates in conjunction with the arc-starting device , is mounted above the mercury pool . Cooling coils allow water to circulate within the tank , and a fin-type radiator aids in cooling the anode . A vacuum pump removes any air that may leak into the tank and removes occluded gases given off by the electrodes during operation . The mercury-jet arc-starting device is welded to the bottom of the tank . A plunger with a center hole , located within a steel tube , is caused to move downward against a spring when a sur rounding winding is momentarily energized . When the plunger moves , mercury flows through the hole in a solid stream against the excitation anode . A low voltage is impressed between the cathode and the excitation anode , and when the ejected mercury strikes , an arc is established which maintains the cathode spot on the mercury pool . Arc baffles are inserted between the mer cury pool and the anode as an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit is placed in service , each tank must have its excitation established before the rectifier is placed on the line . This is done automatically when a single switch is closed . Means are also provided to restrike any arc if an arc interruption occurs . A large Excitron installation consisting of 288 individual rectifiers is illustrated in Fig. 6-28 . For equivalent ratings , individual units also offer advantages over multianode units as they are smaller in dimensions , much lighter in weight . and can be easily replaced with a spare tank in a portion of the time required for overhauling other types of converting equipment . Typical efficiency curves for an Excitron unit and for rotating converters operating at 275 and 600 volts are shown in Fig. 6-29 . It is apparent that the mercury-arc rectifier is very efficient , particularly in traction service where light load factors prevail during long periods of the day . 6-9 . The Ignitron Maximum instantaneous current in a thyratron is limited by electron emission at the cathode ; bombardment and destruction of that electrode are inevitable if the rated current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , using a mercury-pool cathode , can supply a maximum current limited only by the temperature rise of the tube and the resultant increase in mercury-vapor pressure . It is this ability of the mercury-arc rectifier to supply extremely large momentary overloads without the slightest damage , coupled with its economic advantages , which has made the tube so popular in the steel , mining , transportation , and electrochemical industries . In 1932 J. Slcpian and L. R. Ludwig developed the ignitron . This tube eliminates the keep-alive circuit of a mercury-arc tube by the introduction of an ignitor made of a relatively high-resistance refractory material , such as Carborundum or boron carbide . The ignitor is mounted to make contact with the mercury pool , and it strikes an arc at a suitable time while the anode is at a positive potential with respect to the mercury-pool cathode . Connection is usually made to a suitable phase-shifting network , and at the proper time a momentary current flows in the ignitor circuit , producing a small spark at the junction of the ignitor with the mercury surface , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a few microseconds . The arc extinguishes at the end of the positive half-cycle , and after a short period the gas deionizes , and the tube remains inoperative , of course , during the succeeding half-cycle . Ignitions are manufactured in various forms and may be classified into various types depending on the size and application . The permanently scaled tubes are commonly used for the lower capacity installations , which at present range up to 400 amperes in commercial sizes for adaptation in welder circuits and the like , whereas the larger , continuously pumped tubes , like the one shown in cross section in Fig. 6-30 , are usually employed in rectification or conversion service and are made in capacities up to 6000 kilowatts for 600-volt installations . A simplified circuit utilizing two ignitrons for full-wave single-phase rectification is // given in Fig. 6 ? 31 ( a ) ; aside from the ignition , to be discussed in the next section , the basic circuit arrangement is similar to that of vacuum-diode rectifiers . An inverse-parallel or back-to-back circuit employing two ignitrons and commonly used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each ignitron conducts similar to a switch during every other half-cycle , and no direct current but only alternating current flows in the load circuit . A typical ignitron installation , used as a contactor in welding equipment , is illustrated in Fig. 6 ? 32 . The two ignitrons are located in the lower compartment , and a group of thyratrons , used in sequence to time the various operations during welding , are mounted on the back of the upper timer panel . The rating of ignitrons used in switching service is based on the maximum demand , which consists of the product of the effective current through a pair of tubes , connected back-to-back , and the line voltage , controlled by the tubes . Since the voltage drop across the are remains essentially constant for various loads , it is apparent from Ohm 's law that the internal resistance of the tube varies inversely with the load current , and , therefore , heat ing varies in direct proportion and not as the square of the load current as in ordinary electrical equipment . The intermittent operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows for short periods , also needs to be considered in their rating . Practically all ignitrons are water-cooled to dissipate the heat // of the arc and to control the mercury-vapor pressure ; they are constructed so that the water flows at a high velocity for efficient heat transfer from the tube walls to the water . Ignitron-rectifier installations , totaling a capacity of more than 3,000,000 kilowatts , have been made during the decade from 1940 to 1950 . This undoubtedly represents the greatest application of any electronic device from the standpoint of power utilization . Ignitron rectifiers are preferred over rotating machinery be254 Gas-filled Tubes cause of their higher efficiency , lower installation and maintenance costs , absence of noise and vibration , and simplicity of operation . 6-10 . Ignitron Excitation Circuits An ignitron is characterized by the periodic establishment of the are through the aid of an ignitor whenever the anode of the ignitron is at a positive potential with respect to its cathode . Voltage and current requirements of the ignitor depend on various factors , such as the ignitor material , depth of Imiuersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ignition will occur if a maximum , instantaneous , positive voltage of about 200 volts is // applied between the ignitor and the cathode , or if a maximum instantaneous current of 40 amperes flows through the ignitor circuit . Ignition time is very short , and the transfer of the discharge to the anode circuit is accomplished within the range of 10 to 100 microseconds ; no further demands are then made on the ignitor until the start of the next conduction period , which occurs a complete cycle later . The average current through the ignitor is quite small ; however , the large peak current at the desired instant of ignition and the reduction of the ignitor current to zero for the remainder of the cycle require special circuits . Three major ignition circuits have been developed : the anode-firing , the capacitor-thyratron , and the saturable-reactor circuits . In the anode-firing circuit , shown in Fig. 6-33(a) , the ignitor receives its energy from the main anode circuit through either a gas-filled diode or preferably through a grid-controlled rec tifier , that is , a thyratron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cathode , and the load resistor RL . Current can flow through the auxiliary tube and cause ignition only when its anode and the ignitron anode are at a positive potential with regard to their respective cathodes . If the tube is a simple rectifier , current begins to flow through the ignitor as soon as the voltage of the positive half-cycle reaches the ionization value of the vapor in the rectifier , that is , about 15 volts . The ignitor fires when the voltage across the ignitor-cathode junction , or the current // through it , reaches the critical value . An instant later , the arc at the junction is transferred to the main anode , which is at a higher potential with respect to the cathode because of the voltage drops across the rectifier and the ignitor junction . The ignitron anode current rises abruptly and , in the case of a resistance load , follows the sinusoidal waveform of the voltage to the end of the half-cycle where ionization of the mercury vapor ceases . Because of the establishment of the arc , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls immediately to a value of about 12 to 15 volts , and since this is essentially equal to the voltage drop across the auxiliary rectifier , the current through the ignitor falls to zero , as shown in Fig. 6 ? 33 ( b ) . When a thyratron equipped with a phase shifter is substituted for the rectifier , the ignitron may be fired , within limits , at any point along the positive half-cycle , and the average current through the load may be varied continuously from a minimum of nearly zero , obtained by firing the tube near the end of the half-cycle , to the maximum , achieved by firing it near the beginning . The figure shows a single ignitron ; for switching service two tubes are used in a back-to-back connection , and for rectifier service the tubes are connected as full-wave rectifiers in single- , three- , or six-phase adaptations . Anode firing , although it has the advantages of simplicity and high efficiency , has certain inherent limitations . For example , the ignitor current flows through the load , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be difficult to obtain ignition . The capacitor-thyratron ignition circuit , shown in Fig. 6-34 , offers greater firing reliability and flexibility than the previous circuit . A capacitor C is charged during one alternation of the supply voltage through a half-wave dry-plate rectifier RE . During the succeeding alternation , when the grid of thyratron V2 reaches the desired firing voltage , as determined by the phase // shifter , the capacitor discharges through the thyratron , the ignitor , mercury pool , and load resistor in series , causing the ignitron to fire . The current pulse through the ignitor results in certain ignition and permits two or more ignitrons to be operated in parallel . This ignition circuit , like the previous one , uses one or more thyratrons , depending on the number of phases of the power circuit and the duty . Thyratrons are rather expensive , and , since their life is not indefinite , tube costs , added to the nuisance of unexpected tube failure , makes either of these circuits less popular than the firing circuit to be described next . The saturable-reactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiating the arc by discharging a capacitor through the junction of the ignitor and the mercury pool . Two reactors are shown in the basic circuit of Fig. 6 ? 35 ; the reactor LI is of the conventional kind , consisting of one or more coils wound on a laminated iron core , and is designed to operate on the initial , linear portion , that is , below the knee , of the B ? H curve , while reactor L2 has its winding placed on a core made of a highly permeable material that saturates magnetically when energized with only a few ampere-turns . Capacitor C is charged through the reactor LI , and a small current , insufficient to cause ignition , flows through the ignitor of V. in series with the dry-plate rectifiers RE1 and RE2 . At a given voltage the re-actor L2 saturates , its impedance becomes very low , and the capacitor discharges as a pulse through the same circuit . Re258 Gas-filled Tubes actor L2 saturates equally well and produces current pulses in either direction , whereas a thyratron conducts only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one firing circuit is employed to fire alternately two ignitrons at intervals of 180 electrical degrees ; three firing circuits can supply the excitation for six ignitrons in a three-phase full-wave rectifier . Grid phase control for each individual firing circuit is obtained from a mechanical phase shifter or more commonly from a phase-shifting network . It will be noted that the particular phase winding of the charging transformer T2 is different from the phase winding on the rectifier transformer Ti for which it supplies the excitation . Many combinations of winding connections can be made in three-phase charging transformers so as to produce a suitable phase difference between the capacitor charging circuit and the associated winding on the main rectifier transformer . Such phase displacements , together with a phase shifter , provide a reliable and accurate firing method for an ignitron at any desired phase position while its anode is positive . 6-11 . Gaseous-tube Inverters The process of changing direct current into alternating current is known as inversion , and a tube used for this purpose is termed an inverter . Vacuum-tube oscillators perform this function but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequencies , or a combination of both are required . Mercury-arc tubes and ignitrons , with their low internal resistance , practically constant arc-drop , and large current-carrying capacity , offer the key for simple and highly efficient power inversion . They operate on the basis of alternately switching a unidirectional current from the d-c source through mercury-arc tubes or ignitrons to the two portions of a center-tapped transformer winding . Before considering circuits for gaseous-tube inverters , it may be well to recall some of the characteristics of capacitors and inductors , because inverter operation also depends on the use of these reactive circuit elements . Time constants of reactors were discussed in Sec. 3-11 , and it was also mentioned that , when a constant voltage is suddenly applied to the combination of a capacitor in series with a resistor , the voltage across the capacitor does not rise instantaneously but exponentially . At the instant immediately after the switch is // closed , the circuit acts as if the capacitor were short-circuited , and a current , limited only by the circuit resistance , flows momentarily . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the current drops practically to zero within a short period depending on the value of the time constant . When the circuit is subsequently opened the capacitor voltage remains constant except when a resistor is connected across the capacitor , when the voltage decreases exponentially . In an inductive circuit , current can not rise to its maximum value or fall to zero instantaneously ; there is a similar delay , also determined by the time constant . The establishment or decay of the magnetic field surrounding an inductor in which a changing current flows causes the generation of a voltage that is directed against the impressed voltage for an increasing current , or causes the generation of a voltage that is directed with the impressed voltage to prolong the current flow for a decreasing current . A capacitor is used to interrupt the direct current that flows through a single inverter tube , or to commutate , that is , to switch the current from one to the other , in two-tube inverter circuits . The placement of the capacitor C , as shown in Fig. 6-36 , deter-mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel-type inverter . In both circuits , employing thvratrons , switch S , must be closed first to allow the cathode and the tube to reach their operating temperatures . When the switch Sz of the series-
