, Phologrophs by Gus Posguorello in foreign languages for grammar-school children . I was curious to sec one in action . But I wanted a fair sample  --  not a class of whiz kids , or of children who might have learned to speak another language at home . This class , in an ordinary public school in Hackensack , New Jersey , filled the bill  --  average American-speaking ten-year-olds in a normal American-speaking town , about to have a lesson in Spanish . Into the room swept a dark-haired , attractive young woman  --  Miss Filomcna Pcloro , in charge of Hackensack 's grammar-school foreign-language classes , whom I had met a little while earlier . She was carrying a couple of dolls in Spanish dress , a little map of Spain drawn on cardboard , and a few other odds and ends . She flashed a bright smile . " iBuenosdias , niiios ! " she called out cheerfully . " iBuenos dias , senorita ! " chorused the kids . The class was under way . Spanish began to rattle around the room  --  teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth . I know a little Spanish , but all I could do was stare ; the talk was much too fast for me to follow . Holding up the dolls , Miss Peloro asked questions . Answers snapped back . Other kids chimed in . I managed to grasp that the class was talking about the costumes  --  not just naming the items , but talking about what they were made of , their colors , and so on . Putting away the dolls , Miss Peloro handed out a couple of toy telephones . One boy went through the motions of calling up another one , two rows away . They had a brisk conversation . Straining hard , I was able to figure out that it was something about a dog . Then the phones were put away and the whole class sang a song . Then some sang another song while a few got up and did a little Spanish dance . I 've never seen a class jump with such life . At the least pause , eager hands would shoot up all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little map of Spain propped up against the blackboard , Miss Peloro was asking questions about geography . 1 caught the word rios . Down the rows the questions went , back came the answers , naming the rivers of Spain . One boy said something that sounded like Duro . Miss Peloro held up a hand . Instant stop . Facing the boy , pronouncing carefully , Miss Peloro said the name , Dwairro . The boy tried again . Miss Peloro repeated . Two or three tries and the boy got it right , Dwairro . " May Nen , " Miss Peloro nodded . The class took off again at full speed . And then , abruptly , it was over . Gathering up the map of Spain and the other stuff , Miss Peloro waved a hand . " Hasta matlana , " she smiled , as she went out the door . " i Hasta matiana ! " the kids called after her . A moment later , as I got up to leave , they were opening their desks , taking out books for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers on her own desk and stood up . " Now , you remember " she was saying , as I closed the door . They were the first words of English I had heard since entering the room . It had been a flabbergasting experience for me . I took a language course for two years when I was in high school , and did all right in it . But at ten years of age or less , these kids spoke their second language so much better than I or any of my classmates ever did that there was simply no comparison . They did not know anything about Spanish grammar . They could n't read or write a word of the language , but they could speak it and hear it with an easy , ready fluency no language class of mine ever even came close to . What struck me most was that they did it so exuberantly . When I was in school , studying a foreign language was tedious work . But it was plain that for these kids learning Spanish or French  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work at all . Obviously , they enjoyed every minute of it . One of the regular classroom teachers , talking to me later , even complained in a mild way that perhaps they enjoy it too much . " They get so keyed up in language class , " she said , " with all the singing and talk . Sometimes it 's a job to calm them down afterward . " For three and a half years now these foreign-language classes have been going on in Hackensack . Every child in the public grammar schools gets them , fifteen minutes every school day , first grade through sixth . Last fall the classes moved up another notch , into seventh grade , where the kids get their first foreign-language reading and writing . Next fall the courses will go up one grade more . Its a remarkable program , probably the broadest and best in the country for teaching foreign languages to grammar-school kids , an idea that has been spreading through our schools amazingly these past few years . As recently as five years ago , foreign-language classes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until 1953 , the number of public schools that had elementary-grade foreign-language classes was less than a hundred , for the whole country . Today the number has skyrocketed to at least 2000 ? the idea is spreading so fast that statistics ca n't quite keep up with it  --  in some 500 communities all across the land . This winter about 700,000 elementary-grade kids are learning foreign languages . The boom is still going on  --  gathering speed , if anything . Within the past few months grammar-school foreign-language courses  --  academically known as FLES ( for Foreign Language in Elementary School ) courses  --  have received the blessing of the Education Department of New York State . And the United States Office of Education has recommended FLES courses , beginning in third grade , for schools generally . Hackensack joined the FLES parade  --  jumped right to the head of it , in fact  --  largely because of a man named Philip J. Audino , who died in 1957 . Audino was a member of the town 's school board for several years and head of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual two-year high-school language courses , taken by a minority of students  --  nothing out of the ordinary at all . But Audino , who had grown up speaking Italian and English at home and majored in French in college , had a lifelong interest in languages . When FLES came along he was fascinated by it . With help from the Modern Language Association , a private organization of topflight language specialists that was offering advice on FLES programs , Audino worked out a plan . Whereas most FLES programs were for selected children only , his would take in every child ; where others ran for as little as two years , his courses would cover a full eight years ; where some others were taught by almost any teacher who happened to be handy , his courses would be taught by highly qualified specialists who would teach nothing else . It was a radical plan to present to any school board , but in the spring of 1955 Audino 's board voted unanimously , not only to adopt it but to begin it at the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovation was received without enthusiasm . Few parents paid any attention to it at all , and the reaction of the regular teaching staff was , in general , cool . But Audino had a stanch ally in J. Hobart DePuyt , Hackensack 's popular superintendent of schools , and the two men set to work looking for teachers . Il They were not easy to Find . For teaching a foreign language to small children , fluency and a good accent are absolutely essential , because the children will learn exactly what they hear . Many language majors and even language teachers do n't speak their languages well enough to be able to teach them to first-graders . But almost next door to Hackensack , at Montclair State Teachers College , the two men found Miss Peloro . A New Jersey girl , a language-major graduate of Montclair State TC , she had never taught grammar-school kids in her life . But her spoken Spanish was flawless , she knew how languages should be taught , and she was enthusiastic about FLES . Other teachers were found . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades one through ! bur . Since then the classes have extended upward one grade each year , with French or Spanish introduced at the bottom for each new class of first-graders . From the first , Miss Peloro knew that some parents , and a lot of the regular classroom teachers , would be watching the new language program closely . They 'd expect to see some results , perhaps in a few months . She decided to give them a demonstration . The day school opened she began a special drill with one class of fourth-graders , during their fifteen minutes a day . At the school 's traditional Columbus Day pageant , these fourth-graders put on a playlet showing Columbus at the court of the King and Queen of Spain . After just two weeks of practice they did the whole scene in Spanish , without a single pause or mistake . The parents were astounded , and the regular-staff teachers hardly less so . From that time on , the new program was in . In three years , with the language classes now taking in about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have become a trilingual Babel , with parents floundering helplessly in cross-currents of French and Spanish . It has n't worked that way . The languages are taught in units  --  songs and dialogues that the kids memorize . But the memorized units are all they know . They do n't know enough words to use French or Spanish for everyday talk . In a way , this is probably just as well . But it can lead to awful frustration . There was , for instance , the sad case of a fourth-grader named Daniel . A year or so ago , Daniel learned that a Cuban family had moved in just down the block from his house , with a son about his own age . Daniel was overjoyed . Like all his classmates , Daniel delighted in practicing his Spanish and was very proud of it . Here was a chance to try it out on a real Spanish speaker . And when that Cuban boy heard it , would n't he be amazed ? Hardly able to contain himself , Daniel set forth . The dialogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatches of , about a dog . " Have you a dog ? " it begins . " Yes . " Then it goes on from there  --  what 's the dog 's name , how big is he , how old is he , what color is he , and so on , a long and fascinating discussion of detail . Daniel had it all down cold . Beaming with pleasure , he walked up to the Cuban boy . " Have you a dog ? " he asked , in Spanish . His accent was perfect . The Cuban boy shook his head . " No , " he said sadly . Daniel 's jaw dropped . It was the wrong answer , and he could n't think of another word to say . The story brings up a question sometimes asked about these courses and the FLES idea . Are these children really learning languages or are they just parroting noises ? The answer is yes , to both . Parroting noises is how children learn EVENING T E SAT UR DAY languages , the way every child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units of language which the children memorize , though they seem unrelated , actually are not . Later on , the connections between them will be established , and by the lime a child finishes sixth grade he 'll have a Spanish or French vocabulary of at least 2000 words and a very considerable ability to shape the language to his own thoughts . The big shift of foreign languages into grammar schools was started by Earl J. McGrath , United States Commissioner of Education in the early 1950 's . When he took office , McGrath , unslike Hackensack 's Audino , had no particular interest in foreign languages . But as Commissioner of Education he had some hard facts to face . One was that language study in our schools was being neglected shockingly . Thirty to forty years ago nearly half the students in high schools , and two out of three in colleges , took at Igast , one foreign language ; but by the 1930's. - the proportion was down to fifteen per cent , or only one student out of every seven in high schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools no foreign-language courses were even offered , and in most of the rest the courses ran only two years  --  not enough to give students much more than a smattering , In the study of foreign languages , we were far behind almost every other major nation in the world . At the same time , our need for people trained in languages was much greater than ever before . The shortage had shown up sharply in World War 11 , when the armed services suddenly needed thousands of people able to speak foreign languages  --  and could n't find anywhere near enough of them . The services solved the wartime problem by setting up special crash-program language schools of their own . The schools did a spectacularly good job . But suppose there was another emergency  --  would there be time to teach people languages after it began ? In the postwar years the need for language-trained people mounted . Our foreign commitments expanded enormously . Tens of thousands of Americans went abroad to administer them . But only about one in thirty could be found with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find enough language-trained people to fill its own staff . To train more , it set up a department language school in 1946 , under the Foreign Service Institute . This was , and still is , one of the finest language schools anywhere . But it scarcely touched the large-scale shortage , which was bad not only abroad but at home . In vital technological work , for instance , American scientists were maddeningly handicapped by ignorance of what was being done in other countries . More than once they discovered , too late , that they had wasted invaluable time and effort duplicating work that had already been done abroad , because they could n't find enough people to keep up with translations of foreign reports . Knowledge of foreign languages might once have been thought of by most Americans as a pleasant but rather idle asset , like being able to play the piano ; but by the 1950 's it wasa national need of the first order . And still kept goingdown. se enrollments in schools The situation was enough to convince anybody that something ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ! s that the process was helped along by his own embarrassment at some international conferences . Delegates from other countries , gathering in relaxed groups outside the regular meetings , would casually fish around among the four or five languages January I959 each of them spoke , lied one in common and proceed to have a talk . McGrath , speaking nothing but English , could only stand on the side lines a good part of the time , feeling like a bit of a dope . In May . 1952 , at his own request , McGrath addressed a meeting of language teachers in St. Louis . " I have seen the light , " he said , and urged that language study be started in schools early , in the elementary grades instead of in high school . The following January , he held a top-level national conference of educators and interested laymen to talk about the idea further . That conference touched off the FLES boom . It was as if educators had given up hope that the old-style high-school language course would ever come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . Within a few months , FLES courses of one kind or an-other began popping up all over . Some schools seized on the idea so eagerly that they did n't even take time to understand it . To get language study started earlier they simply shifted their high-school courses bodily down into sixth or seventh grade . This gave them a " FLES program , " in name , but in fact missed the whole main idea . For the great advantage of starting language classes early lies in teaching the ? languages not by reading or writing , but by speech . Up to about twelve years of age children have what psychologists call a " language plasticity " that disappears later on . While it lasts , their facility at learning new sounds is truly phenomenal . No matter how strange the sounds might - seem to a teen-ager or grownup , or how hard to pronounce , little children can learn them easily , perfectly and very fast . For small children there 's simply no such thing as a difficult language . All children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hearing or of speech . Taught by voice  --  and by a good teacher  --  small children can learn to speak a foreign language  --  or for that matter more than one  --  with a pure accuracy of pronunciation and accent that not one older student in a hundred could even hope to match . What 's more , children , when properly taught , learn to " think in " the new language from the start . Here 's where up-to-date speech courses , developed largely in ? the famed armed-services language schools during World War II and in the excellent Foreign Service Institute language school since , differ most from old-style " conversational-method " courses . In an old-style course , for instance , a child might be taught that cache is " the French word for - cow " ? as indeed it is . But in such courses as Hackensack 's the child learns cache , instead , directly in connection with the object , cow . No English is used , so that the association established is not between two words  --  cache and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the animal . a W vith repetition and more repetition the new word soon takes its place in the child 's mind right alongside the old one , assuming almost equal value with it . Show him a picture of Old Bessie , after he 's been at it a while , and he 'll tell you its a cow if he happens to be thinking in English , or une cache if he happens to be thinking in French , one as readily as the other , with no need for mental translating . I began to grasp how those ten-year-olds could rattle off Spanish so fast . They did n't have to fumble for words . After practicing every school day for three years they knew the words almost as well as any five-year-old , also after about three years of practice , knows simple words of his own language . The enthusiasm of the kids for their language practice is tremendous . In homes where there are two or more chil dren taking the same language , practice sessions go on all the time . In homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the languages to each other . In homes where there are big brothers or sisters , there is humility . These big brothers and sisters are the most disgruntled group in Hackensack , having been too old to get in on the language classes when they began . They 've swallowed their pride by now , most of them , and are getting coaching from the little kids . One mother who has a daughter in junior high and two smaller ones , one taking French and the other Spanish , told me that the oldest girl is being coached by the little sprouts in both languages , so she can have a head start in whichever one she elects to take in high school . Sometimes the kids try to coach their parents , but this does n't always work out so well . Madeline Devitt , one of the French teachers , told me about a first-grader in a class of hers who was working on his mother pretty hard . He kept at it for weeks ; then , all of a sudden , he stopped talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , asking him how the lessons were coming along . He shrugged . " I quit , " he said , " Why , what 's the matter ' ? " Miss Devitt inquired . " No use , " said the boy hopelessly . " She just ca n't learn to pronounce it right . " The regular classroom teachers , as far as I could tell , are now sold on the language classes completely . I talked to several , including some who said frankly that they had n't liked the idea at the beginning . They 've changed their minds . The enthusiasm of the kids is something you ca n't ignore . Moreover , the children 's progress in other studies has n't suffered at all ; the fifteen minutes a day given to language class , the regular teachers have found , can be made up . Some even think the general progress is improved , because in language class itself the kids get extra practice in counting and in naming 63 things , and little lessons in history and geography , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new that last fall , as the first of Hackensack 's junior-grade language classes moved into seventh grade , Miss Peloro and her staff had to invent ways of teaching of their own . To teach reading and writing Spanish to these kids , who can already speak it , the old high-school-course material is completely useless , particularly as Miss Peloro aims to continue teaching in Spanish , without translating . Unable to find any textbooks she thought would do it at all , Miss Peloro spent the summer in Spain , working up original course material which is now in use for the first time . The whole field is full of explorers , all aiming at the same goal , but often differing widely about the best way to get there . Hicksville , Long Island , has a FLES program that 's comparatively old-established , having been running now for six years . It 's for selected children only , reading ability being a big factor in the selection . The courses begin in first grade and extend almost all the way through high school , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Miss Vera Villegas , who has been running the Hicksville program all along , does n't hold with the memorized-dialogue way of teaching , and never uses it . Also , she begins foreign-language reading and writing  --  in German and Italian , as well as French and Spanish  --  in third grade instead of seventh , simply using ordinary first-grade textbooks of the language 's native country . Her method works too  --  at least for selected children . Other schools are experimenting in other ways . Some schools in Dade County , Florida , for instance , have been trying out a French course by radio . Schenectady , New York , offers French via television , and some New York City schools are trying foreign-language courses on TV also . Other schools are using courses on phonograph records or electronic tapes . None of these , obviously , is as good as having competent , live , language-speaking teachers right there in the kids ' classrooms ; but some of them work pretty well . Out of all the trials and errors so far , language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One is that the earlier language study starts , the better ; ideally it should begin in the first grade or even , if possible , in kindergarten . Another is that frequent short classes are better than less frequent longer ones . A third is that no matter how early or late language study starts it should continue , at a fairly high rate of intensity  --  preferably every school day  --  for at least five years . This last touches on a fundamental question often raised about FLES . Is it really any use ? Suppose children do learn languages easily and well  --  by the time they grow up , wo n't they forget their languages anyway ? The question is , of course , loaded . For one thing , why pick on languages ' ? The same question could be asked about history , geography and a lot of other subjects just as well . For another thing , the question assumes that children will instantly drop language study , like a hot brick , as soon as they get the chance . But judging by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly seems unwarranted . And even children who do drop out wo n't have wasted their time . Knowing how to speak a language , specialists point out , is an acquired physical skill , like knowing how to swim or ride a bicycle ; and once you learn to do it really well you never completely lose it . Even after years of disuse you can pick it up again with a TILE SATURDAY EVENINfl PrisT little practice . The big point here is that you must learn it well in the hist place . There 's something else about FLES that at first sounds a little fantastic . But it 's generally accepted that anyone who has had good training in one foreign language can learn others , later on , much better and more easily than someone who has n't . Which one you start with makes little or no difference . Miss Peloro talks seriously of the day when Nigh-school language courses at Hackensack might extend to so-called exotic languages , like Russian or Chinese , along with the continuing French and Spanish . FLEStrained teen-agers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's no reason why they 'd have to stop with one more . In Sweden , students have eight years of English , six of German and live of French behind them , plus a good grounding in Danish and Norwegian  --  six languages , if you count their native Swedish too  --  at the same age at which youngsters here are just getting out of high school . We have , indeed , a long way to go to match that , but Hackensack is one town that 's ready to go full speed ahead . The first time 1 went there Superintendent of Schools DePuyt told me that in three years not one parent had ever voiced anything but praise for the language program . I found , indeed , that many of them take great civic pride in it . There is , it seems , a sort of running rivalry between Hackensack and neighboring towns , notably Teaneck , concerning which has the best schools : and some Hackensackers chortle gleefully that their language classes give them a big edge in that . Others spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower 's serious statement to the Annapolis graduating class last June that proficiency in foreign languages is " an indispensable step toward a peaceful world . " Still others spoke of the practical value of knowing a foreign language  --  Spanish , especially , for our developing relations with Latin America . But I think the best comment of all was the simplest , and the one I heard far more than any other ? " 1 only wish they 'd had something like this when I was in school . " Basketball 's Little Whirlwind ( Continued from Page 19 ) winning the title . Last season we went all the way , and Martin was the guy who clinched the final game for us . " That last remark is difficult to accept , even making due allowance for Kerner 's habit of exaggerating the talents of players on whom he gets violent crushes . In the decisive game won by the Hawks , 110-109 , Bob Pettit erupted with fifty points  --  a playoff record  --  and accounted for all but two of his team 's last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the circumstances , Kerner 's analysis of the game seems as distorted as a wife 's opinion of her husband 's friends . " Pettit 's bundle would have gone up the flue if not for Martin , " Kerner insists . " He alone broke up the all-court press the Celtics threw at us to disrupt our attack . Instead of waiting until we came down the floor , they dogged us in the backcourt as soon as we got the ball . Cousy , Sharman , Ramsey and Heinsohn can eat you alive with that defense , but Martin never lost control of the ball . His poise under pressure put Cousy over a barrel  --  and in my book Cousy is the greatest player of all time . " Cousy comments , " Kerner is out of his mind if be thinks anybody but Pettit won the game . In the clutch , though , Martin refused to let us beat him . I 've never seen a tougher competitor . " The most striking item in the box score that night , apart from Pettit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department . He took exactly three shots in the entire game and missed all of them . Martin disregarded his own scoring to feed passes to men who were firing at the target more accurately . He observes laconically , " My function is to get the ball to our big scorers and guard the opposition 's best small player . I take a lot of pride in my defense . But I do n't care if a man having a hot night makes me look bad as long as we win . The only satisfaction for me is winning , regardless of my performance . " You 've heard this lofty sentiment before , of course . It is the oldest , and generally the phoniest , clich ? in sports . However , Martin 's actions have given it the ring of sincerity . Two years ago , for example , the chance to run a big-league outfit dropped into Martin 's lap when the Hawks released coach Red Holzman in midseason . After a brief try as the Hawks ' playing coach , Martin resigned the job  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During his first seven years in the league with the Minneapolis Lakers , Martin clashed constantly with the management in contract rhubarbs . The Minneapolis franchise then was highly successful  --  for the owners and for George Mikan , the N.B.A. 's biggest star . Mikan 's imposing salary , which was in the exclusive neighborhood of $35,000 , left nothing but crumbs for the other players . A Laker official abruptly ended one wrangle with Martin by snapping , " We can win with Mikan , Pollard , Mikkelsen and two bellhops . Who needs you ? " In 1954 , after having helped the Lakers win four championships in five years , Martin held out until the opening game . He finally had to settle for about $9000 , the club 's original offer . Having missed all the preseason workouts , he sat on the bench during the opener as Frank Selvy racked up fifteen points against the Lakers in the first period . Coach John Kundla turned to Martin and asked , " Do you want to try to cool off this guy ? " Martin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept , but there was a game to be won . He held Selvy to three points in the remaining thirty-six minutes . In the windup of the 1957 playoffs , when the Hawks carried the Celtics to seven games before succumbing by 125-123 in double overtime , Martin 's showing was even more impressive on paper than in the 1958 finale . He outscored Cousy , twenty-three points to twelve , covering him so effectively that the Boston ace made only two field goals in twenty shots . Martin refuses to discuss that game , however . " I want to forget it , " he says curtly . " We lost . " In contrast , he will dwell interminably on the 1958 clincher , in which he got a mere four points to Cousy 's fifteen . " That was a helluva game , " he beams . " We won . " Martin is far more intense about his basketball than he is about a venture of greater importance to the future security of his wife and two sons . This is a sporting-goods store he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of Houston , Texas , his home town . Martin invested all his money in it three years ago . " Making a success of the store does n't mean as much to me as playing with a winner , " he admitted shortly before the current season began . We were in the dinette of a three-room suite in a residential hotel in St. Louis . Mrs. Martin was in the living room with the boys  --  six-yearold Slater , and Jim , who is four . Martin nodded toward his family . " I know the store is their best bet for the long haul . I work hard in the off season drumming up business with firms that buy equipment for industrial teams . Landing a big order does n't give me the same kick , though , as pulling a tough game out of the fire . " " Do you mind if I ask your wife how she feels about your attitude ? " I inquired . " No , go right ahead . " He smiled . " I 'd like to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He relieved his wife of refereeing a hoop contest between the kids . Fay Martin , an attractive blond girl , shrugged when the question was put to her . She said , " Slater 's mania for basketball was strange to me at first , but I 've learned to live with it " ? they were married back in 1947 , when Slater was a sophomore at the University of Texas . She hesitated for a moment . " I do n't know whether I should be telling this , but after the team loses he guards me all night in bed . He throws his arms at me in his sleep , thrashes his legs and mutters , ' Hey , watch it ! Take that man ! Get that ball ! ' He used to scare me to death . It 's lucky Slater has been with winning teams most of the time . Both of us would have been nervous wrecks if he had been with losers . " Would she be happier if Slater were in another business ? " Yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it , because I know Slater would be miserable . Life for the children and me is much more pleasant and relaxed during the off season . " She looked around the suite . " A hotel is no place to bring up children . We 're constantly disrupting them by moving north in September , then going back to Houston in April . Our older boy should have started in the first grade weeks ago , but he has n't gone to a class yet because I ca n't register him in school until we find an apartment . " Martin was standing in the doorway , listening attentively to his wife . " A professional athlete ca n't help transmitting his tensions to his family , " she went on . " After a man gets established in another business , nobody keeps a box score on every move he makes . If my family and friends knew what an athlete goes through , they 'd realize why Slater gets so keyed up over basketball . " A revealing anecdote about the nervous energy Martin pours into basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who now is a sportscaster in St. Louis . " I was rooming with Martin on a road trip last year when the team flew to Boston after a game in Philadelphia , " Blattner relates . " We did n't check into the hotel until three o'clock in the morning , but Martin said he was too jumpy to sleep . I was pounding the pillow when a movement in the room awakened me . Martin was pacing the floor . I asked him if anything was wrong . " ' No , I 'm all right , ' he said . ' I 'm just thinking . ' " ' Thinking about what ? ' I asked . " ' About Cousy , ' he answered . " I looked at my watch . ' At six o'clock in the morning ? ' I yelled . " ' I 've been thinking about him since he came into the league in 1950 , ' he said . " Fortunately for the Hawks , Martin is not the type who irritates his fellow players with shrill exhortations about winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're playing with my money , " but his comments during games usually are confined to technical details . After the final whistle he does n't hang around for the locker-room sessions in which the boys second-guess everyone in sight . Martin is out of the place in ten minutes . " Post-mortems are a waste of time , " he says . " I know what happened . I do n't want to hear half-baked excuses why we lost ; and if we won , I want to think of the next game . I 'm not interested in ancient history . " This aloofness disappears once Martin is out of the pressure cooker . He always is a customer for a poker session or a movie , and he is the chief instigator of the gags the " runts " delight in pulling on the " goons . " His favorite gambit is to follow six-eleven Charley Share and six-nine Bob Pettit into a crowded hotel elevator , blink at them incredulously through his glasses and announce to the other passengers , " The circus must be in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reprimanded him for his rudeness . " You are absolutely right , sir , " Martin said gravely . " If these poor unfortunates had human intelligence I might have hurt their feelings . " " Freak " is a word bandied freely around the N.B.A. Actually , the term is more applicable to Martin than anyone else in the literal sense of deviating from the norm . He is a defensive specialist , which makes him a rare bird in these days of mounting emphasis on scoring . Even with a small man , the pros now tend to think first in terms of offense . His primary function supposedly is to set up plays with deft maneuvering and passing . Martin 's tactics on offense are as subtle as a pneumatic drill . He tears straight up the court and pegs the ball to the first man he sees breaking for the basket . Veterans invariably try to pace themselves and get by on clever tricks . Martin is an even-money bet to run faster and longer than any rookie on the court . Martin gives a detached appraisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , " he says casually , in referring to his role as a defensive ace . " You do n't need natural ability to be a good defensive man . The real artists are the scorers . They 've got to have great co-ordination and a delicate touch . Anyone who 's willing to hustle can do a decent job on defense . " It 's a cinch with the new rule " ? since 1954 , the offense has been required to shoot within twenty-four seconds after getting the ball . " When there was more feinting and passing before shots were taken , the man you were guarding might have handled the ball three or four time on one sequence of plays , and you had to bust a gut to stay on top of him all the way . Now , if he does n't shoot the first time , you can relax , because the chances are he wo n't get the ball again .

Of course , I 'm not an absolute bum on offense . I would n't have lasted in the league
