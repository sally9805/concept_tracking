While the free world 's press is quick to trumpet Soviet triumphs and even quicker to imagine them , it can also be faulted by its critics for failure to grasp the real achievements of the West . One such critic is the New York Times 's Paris-based correspondent , Cyrus L. Sulzberger , who wrote last week that NATO conference delegates " came away encouraged " by the decisions reached in Paris , but that the " impression spread about the world was one of gloom . " <P> To back up his argument , Newsman Sulzberger excerpted a letter to onetime NATO Commander in Chief Alfred Gruenther in which Belgium 's NATO Ambassador Andre de Staercke chided the Western press for its " masochistic " tendency to see " just the weak points of our position . " This attitude , said Veteran Diplomat de Staercke , is compounded by " lack of analysis , by sheer ignorance , by that kind of facility which makes bad news easier to believe than good news , or pessimism more secure than optimism .
