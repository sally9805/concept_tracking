Not all the fireworks connected with the latest Carnegie International art show ( TIME , Oct. 24 ) were confined to the exhibition itself . Juror G. David Thompson , a Pittsburgh steelman and art collector , complained vehemently to the press that his foreign colleagues on the jury were unduly prejudiced in favor of entries from their native lands , brushing off U.S. contributors with two honorable mentions . Other partisans of U.S. art muttered that Carnegie Director Gordon Washburn himself was to blame for the poor U.S. showing , that he had ignored some of the most promising young U.S. painters . But the most baffled reaction of all came from gallerygoers who were left frankly bewildered by the preponderantly abstract show . Last week Director Washburn tried to set at least the gallerygoers straight . Said he to a Pittsburgh Press reporter : <P> " The custom of painting sweet and simple pictures has dropped out of fashion . Styles in art keep changing just as they do in architecture , wallpaper and automobiles . " Even with the most grotesque abstractions " one sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn to appreciate a homely woman because of her fine spirit . A modern abstract artist no longer paints his mother from a particular spot in the kitchen , at a particular hour in the afternoon when the light falls on her face with a certain glow . Instead , he paints a composite idea of his mother to show how he has felt toward her during her lifetime . He prefers to paint her not as a model but as an idea . Therefore , an abstract work of art is a projection of the mind of an artist , and the painting is an image of a mental process . A person in a gallery should try to understand the artist 's motive . There is no hope for him if he fails to do so . "
