From the moment he arrived in London for his six-week rock-'n ' - roll tour of Britain , Tennessee 's flaxen-haired Jerry Lee Lewis , 22 , made himself at home in the headlines . The tiny , pony-tailed Mississippi schoolgirl he had brought with him , he proudly announced , was none other than his third wife , Myra . Her age : 15 . When reporters gaped , Lewis , resplendent in blue velvet trousers , casually drawled : " I can assure you that my wife is all woman , even though she looks kinda young . " <P> With some distaste , London journalists did their best to explain to their readers the strange marital customs of the U. S. South . But it soon turned out that Mrs. Lewis was even kinda younger than her husband saw fit to say . Memphis court records showed her age to be 13 , and her quickie marriage last December took place more than five months before Jerry 's divorce from wife No. 2 . <P> Hide Whips . Jerry , now resplendent in a redlined black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too : " I guess you could call the mix-up a technical hitch . " He was not really a bigamist , he added , because his second marriage , not his third , was illegal . It was this way : " I was 14 when I first got married . My wife was too old for me ; she was 17 . Then I met Jane . One day she said she was going to have my child . Her brothers were hunting me with hide whips . I was real worried . So I married her , just one week before my divorce from my first wife . It was a shotgun wedding without shotguns . I never married Jane properly , and though she divorced me , she did n't need to . She was never my wife . " <P> The explanation seemed perfectly satisfactory to Myra . " I love married life , " she said , adding that though Jerry had been too busy to buy her a wedding ring , he did get her a red Cadillac . And her father , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to object either . But the London press , already fed up with the antics of Britain 's own rock-'n ' - roll stars , was all shook up now . The Daily Mail angrily demanded that Jerry be sent back " whence he came , somewhere in the mid-belt of America 's deep delinquent South . " " He could and should . " stormed the Sunday People , " be arrested by the police , " reminding the Home Office that cohabiting with 13-year-old girls is against British law . <P> Catcalls &; Combs . Even rock-'n ' - roll fans , whose tolerance of their idols had previously seemed inexhaustible , had had enough . At his first appearance , they booed and catcalled for 20 minutes , while Lewis nervously ran a comb through his long hair . " Go home , baby snatcher ! " they screamed . " Go wheel your wife in a pram ! " After one more such appearance , Jerry 's managers decided to call the tour off . " I did want to stay here long enough to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fumed Jerry : " I do n't feel guilty about nuttin ! " <P> Hurriedly , the J. Arthur Rank organization booked 16-year-old Rock-'n ' - Roller Terry Wayne in his place . Terry 's launching slogan : " He 's good ! He 's clean ! He 's wholesome ! "
