txt GEROSA BIDS CITY CUT ITS SPENDING OR FACE TAX RISE Realty Rate May Be $5 in 5 Years Unless Capital Costs Are Reduced , He Warns DIRE NEED ' TEST ASKED Rehabilitation of School and Transit Facilities Is Urged Instead of New Building By PAUL CROWELL The city was warned yesterday of an over-all real estate tax rate of $4.50 or even $5 within the next five years . Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa said the rate would reach such levels unless the public works construction program were placed and kept on an orderly and conservative basis . The warning was sounded in a report sent to city agencies and officials concerned with the preparation or administration of the 1956 capital budget . Mr. Gerosa urged the Board of Estimate not to authorize more than $250,000,000 of public improvement projects in 1956 except in cases of " dire necessity . " He recommended this course despite the fact that his analysis of the factors involved indicated that the city 's financial position next year probably would be adequate to handle a program of $325,000,000 of public works plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide for spending every avail . able dollar that we have , " he declared . Present Basic Rate $3.85 The over-all real estate tax rate consists of tha basic citywide rate plus a supplementary rate for each borough based upon assessable improvements . The current basic rate is $3.85 for each $100 of assessed valuation . The over-all rates are $3.95 for Brooklyn and Queens , $3.94 for Manhattan and the Bronx and $3.93 for Richmond . The prediction of a possible over-all rate of $4.50 or more , it was learned from a source other than the report , was based on the expectation that the basic rate would rise within five years to $4.26 , an increase of 41 cents above the present level . Fiscal experts who took part in the studies made by the . May . or 's Committee on Management Survey in 1952 warned that a basic rate higher than $4 might imperil the city 's financial position . The Gerosa report warned that the capital budget must be considered in the light of the increased burden its execution might place upon the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating and maintenance costs . Gerosa Views Set Forth Mr , Gerosa noted that the city 's outstanding debt on June 30 was $3,585,000,000 , or about $100,000,000 more than on June 30 , 1954 . " An orderly , conservative program of completing capital improvements , " Mr. Gerosa said . " could hold the outstanding debt at less than $4,000,000,000 . However , a rapid program of cornpletirK capital improvements cdedd very well raise our debt to ( four and one-quarter billion dollars . In either event , debt of ' such magnitude affects the city 's credit which is reflected in ' increased interest costs . " For the currrent year the tax rate was close to $4 per $100 of assessed valuation . It is estimated that within a period of five years it will reach $4.50 , and if we accelerate the completion of projects in the capital improvement program we may very well go to $5 . " I urge the Board of Estimate to scrutinize and to con ? eider carefully every request for capital funds and recommend/ that consideration be given to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dire necessity , do not exceed $250,000,000 for the calendar year 1956 . " The City Planning Commission , which is now drafting a proposed 1956 capital budget , has received from city agencies and departments requests 1956 allocations amounting to a record $1,122,471,942 . The Gerosa report will be received today by the commission , the Board of Estimate , Budget Director Abraham D. Beanie and the City Council . The Board of Estimate . is the only agency that can au // GEROSA BIDS CITY AVOID $5 TAX RATE Continned gram Page 1 thorize actual expenditures of capital funds , once the 196 Capital budget has been adopted . In his report , Mr. Gerosa advised the Board . of Estimate to limit its 1956 authorizations for transit atul school construction projects , ex , ept in " dire emergency " cases ; ' to modernization and rehabilitation expenditures . He also advised the city to seek no additional borrowing , power outside its constitutional debt limit .

" With respect to future allot : ments for transit purposes , " the report declared , " we should adopt is policy that will obtain for the city the greatest service for the least cost . " I think in the years to comet we should consider rehabilitation and modernization and restrict , Ito a last resort , any consideration of new lines . Lengthening platforms , new cars , improving the signal system , should take precedence over any other requirement . This of itself will immediately aid in relieving congestion with no great in= crease in costs of operation . " Mr. Gerosa warned the city against spending any more money to replace obsolete buses on the deficit-producing surface lines now operated by the Transit Authority . To do so , he declared , would be " throwing good money after bad . " Every measure of economy should be used , he advised , to eliminate the need for additional buses at this time , Proposals About Schools Turning to the subject of school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old buildings rather than replacements during this Period of expansion to relieve overcrowding and until we are in a position to substantiate , replacement needs . " " We should develop a sound , long-range school building program that will outline our needs and make for an orderly pro= ' gram , " he declared . " The fact that many of our schools are oldie is no excuse for replacing them . We should also explore , as far , as possible , the possibility of leasing rental space to avoid . building for-temporary peak enrollment , especially in newly built-up areas where enrollment will decline as parents age and parochial schools are built . " The report also advised that further authorizations . by the Board of Estimate for pending slum-clearance housing debt be made contingent-on " some substantial evidence of construction progress on- these old projects . " The sites for many of ' these projects , he declared , were acquired more than three years ago . Mr. Gerosa estimated that the increase in the city 's borrowing power within its debt limit for the six-year period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was due , he said , to a recent revision of equalization rates on real estate in the five boroughs . The revision was made by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment , which ruled that real estate assessments were now 99 I per cent of full value in Manhattan , 96 per tent in the Bronx , 86 per cent in Brooklyn , 75 per cent Queens ' and 62 per cent ' in Richmond . ? The 1954- rates were 99 per cent for Manhattan , 93 per cent for the - Bronx , 83 per cent in Brooklyn , 69 per cent in Queens and 59 per cent in Richmond .. The change in equalization rates was named by Mr. Gerosa as one of several factors that prompted him to estimate that the city 's borrowing power within its debt limit would be only $50,000,000 on Dec. 31 , 1955 , instead a the $104,400,000 he had previously predicted .
