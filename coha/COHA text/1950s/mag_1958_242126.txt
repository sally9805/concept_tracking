New-Dealing New York Lawyer Morris Ernst , who has defended liberal causes ranging from James Joyce 's Ulysses to the Sauerkraut Workers Union , this week finished a chore with a somewhat different aroma . After ten months on the payroll of Dominican Dictator Rafael Trujillo , Ernst declared in a 95-page report that he had not found one scrap of evidence to link his eminent employer to the unsolved Galindez-Murphy case ( TIME , April 2 , 1956 et seq . ) . He airily dismissed as a " canard " the strong circumstantial case that leads newsmen and the FBI to a single theory : that Trujillo Critic Jess de Galindez was kidnaped on his way home from giving a Columbia University lecture on March 12 , 1956 , drugged , and flown to a small airport in the Dominican Republic by American Pilot Gerald Lester Murphy , 22 , who was later silenced by murder in Trujilloland . <P> Murphy Waits . On a few facts the Ernst report , co-signed by ex-New York State Supreme Court Justice William Munson , saw eye-to-eye with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Author ( The Era of Trujillo ) Galindez waved goodbye to a student in front of a New York subway entrance and then vanished , Gerry Murphy , a onetime Eagle Scout from Eugene , Ore. , was waiting at out-of-the-way Zahns Airport near Amityville , L.I. , his rented twin-engined Beechcraft D18 outfitted with extra gas tanks and ready to go . Ernst checked out Murphy 's mysterious journey : take-off just before midnight , gassing in the early morning at Lantana Airport near West Palm Beach , followed by the crucial lapse of from seven to nine hours before he put down again at Tamiami Airport , Miami . <P> At Lantana , Murphy had told the plane attendant that he was carrying a sick man ; the attendant saw one passenger in dark clothes , and on a cot or boards , " what looked like a person covered completely with a blanket or canvas . " When Murphy landed back at Tamiami , he was apparently alone . Estimated round-trip air time for that type of plane from Florida to Monte Cristi Airport on the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Ernst finds this time margin so narrow that the flight was " extremely improbable , " if not impossible . ( Government investigators say Murphy was gone 8 to nine hours-plenty of time . ) Ernst offers a theory of his own : Murphy was a freelance pilot , subject to big temptations " to smuggle nylons , drugs , guns . . . people " ; the destination of his secret flight was rebellious Cuba , not the Dominican Republic . Ernst 's proof came from " confidential sources " in Dictator Fulgencio Batista 's Cuba . To back up Batista ( who got five planeloads of arms in March from Trujillo ) , Ernst solemnly presented an affidavit from Trujillo 's civil aviation chief that the Monte Cristi airstrip was closed at the time and , besides , had no facilities for refueling planes . <P> Key Witness . Because Ernst was openly working for Trujillo , many witnesses greeted him with suspicious silence . Among them : Air Force Sergeant Harold French , an old friend of Murphy 's , who helped install the Beechcraft 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until noon on the fatal day . Murphy told French about the trip in detail , and French told the FBI ( " Gerry said that gasoline would be available to him at Monte Cristi in 5-gal. cans " ) .
