Who are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ? Scholars have given St. John 's symbols of strife and destruction various names , though the sixth chapter of Revelations , through which they ride , names only one-Death ( " and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him ' ' ) . The current issue of Saturday Review presents a new theory by an old student . His name : Herbert Hoover . <P> Ex-President Hoover , 84 , concurs with the generally accepted designations of the rider on the white horse as War ( " a white horse : and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth conquering , and to conquer " ) . He also agrees with the majority that the rider on the black horse was Famine ( " and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand . And I heard a voice . . . say , A measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine " ) . Hoover has something to add from his experience as food administrator in famine-stricken Europe after World War I : " Some modernist might surmise from his ' pair of scales ' fixing the prices of barley and his conserving of ' oil and wine ' that , in addition to being a symbol of famine , he also might have been a symbol of either a profiteer or a food administrator . . one of the torments of war . " <P> Where Quaker Hoover takes issue with tradition is the designation of the rider on the red horse as Pestilence ( " and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword " ) . Hoover points out that in more than 20 different kinds of disasters and punishments mentioned in Revelation , pestilence does not occur once . St. John , he thinks , " had some other idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name which we know in modern times as Revolution . " <P> Hoover admits that revolutions may be good or bad , " but St. John 's horseman had no good purpose ... We do not allow our imaginations to extend to the idea that St. John was prophesying Communism , even though one is tempted , partly because of the prophetic statement that power was given to the horseman ' to take peace from the world .
