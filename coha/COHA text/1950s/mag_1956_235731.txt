" I was sitting at home one day . " said plump , dimple-cheeked Susan Freiberg , " and all at once I had an idea for a tune . <P> I said to myself , ' Why . that sounds like a shrimp . ' " Twelve-year-old Susan 's tune promptly became Minuet of the Shrimp , one of 300 tunes , poems , dances submitted by 60 sixth-grade pupils of Cincinnati 's suburban North Avondale Public School for inclusion in a group cantata , a sweeping experiment at musical education . Last week they had the thrill of performing their work with a professional symphony orchestra .

Secrets was scaled down to a trim 23 minutes , highlighted by The Ballad of Mort , the Whale , Lobster Dante , Ballet of the Octopus and Sea Horse Gallop , a tap dance in 6/8 time , as well as Susan Freiberg 's Minuet of the Shrimp . The local critics disdained to cover the premiere , but Conductor Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music publisher . Said he : " It is beautiful in its whimsicality. "
