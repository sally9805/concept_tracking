Everybody always loved Charlie MacArthur-and he finally succumbed to the curse of too many friends . He began life as a minister 's son in Scranton , Pa . Like many a minister 's kid , he left his Godfearing upbringing far behind . Resolute in his break with things holy , he tackled the newspaper business . At that time , the unholiest newspaper careers in U.S. Christendom were to be found in Chicago . MacArthur went there . In 1914 he began as a reporter on the Chicago Herald-Examiner , switched to Colonel Robert McCormick 's Tribune and later the New York American . <P> A Marvelous Circus . Charles MacArthur was a typical child of the Roaring ' 20s . He was wild , bitter , voluptuous , burdened with a marvelous conscience . He had a personal radiance that few could resist . When he at last beamed into Manhattan , it was inevitable that he should become a knight of the round table at the Hotel Algonquin , favorite mecca of the literati . A measure of his charm was once expressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him lights up when he hears his name , and starts talking about him as if he were a marvelous circus that once passed his way . " <P> Unbeknownst to MacArthur , his triumphant entrance into Manhattan was an anticlimax . His Chicago experiences , along with those of Ben Hecht , another journalist of the Rush Street school , had already fortified his mind for co-authorship of The Front Page , one of the greatest Broadway stage hits of the ' 20s , and a brutally truthful play about U.S. journalism . Unfortunately , the stereotypes it perpetuated linger in the form of the popular image of all newspaper reporters as boozy , totally cynical , wisecracking characters with battered fedoras perched on the backs of their heads . <P> The Front Page opened on Aug. 14 , 1928-and the critics , themselves all journalists of some school or other , drooled over it . Three days later , lionized Playwright MacArthur married a famous actress named Helen Hayes , whose footlight acclaim dated back 22 years to her stage debut as a six-year-old child actress . With a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first meeting , had uttered one of the few famous quotations of the 20th century concocted without benefit of pressagent . " I wish , " he said , " that they were emeralds ! " Charlie , in the most prepossessing of his virtues , was irresistibly glib ; from the moment she met him , Helen Hayes loved him all his life . <P> A Touch of Childhood . When pressed to explain his philosophy of life , Charlie liked to sum it up puckishly with the words of a condemned man whose hanging he once covered in Chicago . The prisoner had halted at the gallows steps and asked : " Is this thing safe ? " The line was worthy of The Front Page . In his dramatic chronicle of slobbish police reporters and a cannibalistic editor , MacArthur described his newsmen as " catatonic , seedy Paul Reveres , full of strange oaths and a touch of childhood . " He wrote six more plays , was in Hollywood often to grind out scenarios , had his good name linked with many a charity ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his and Helen 's only child , * gifted young actress with a promise of greatness , died at 19 of polio ) .
