THE ROAD TO MAN ( 431 pp. ) - Herbert Wendt , translated from the German by Helen Sebba-Doubleday ( $5.95 ) . <P> The Noah of modern times is the natural scientist . As the human deluge threatens to drown the lesser species , he cries his warning : Man is a part of nature ; destroy nature and you destroy man . His ark is the archive in which he stores the species and records their curious lore ; in recent years , many a neo-Noah has splashed a bright coat of paint on his scholarly scow and invited the general public along for the ride . Germany 's Herbert Wendt ( In Search of Adam ) is a skillful skipper for this sort of trip , and he brings his passengers home with their intellectual pockets full of odd and fascinating information about almost everything from the housecat to the hoolock . <P> Items : <P> &gt; The grasshopper 's ear is in its knee . <P> &gt; A chameleon , when blinded , loses the power of changing color ; when refused sex , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only recently the art of barking , which is essentially an attempt to imitate human speech . <P> &gt; Spiders are devoted mothers . <P> &gt; Ninety percent of all plants live in the ocean ; 90% of all multicellular animals are insects . <P> &gt; The tiny hummingbird can fly more than 1,000 miles across open ocean . <P> &gt; Seaweed , which grows to a height of 900 ft. , is the world 's biggest vegetable . <P> &gt; The processionary caterpillar plays a lifelong game of follow-the-leader , and if the head of the first caterpillar is introduced to the tail of the last , the entire procession goes round and round until all the caterpillars die of starvation . <P> &gt; Barracudas herd schools of fish , much as man herds cattle , and slaughter them at their own convenience . <P> Like many popular zoologists , the author is sometimes tempted to play the Barnum of biology , and then he runs an occupational risk : to demonstrate that nature is not merely a catalogue of forms , he is tempted to set it up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pitfall by his almost religious feeling for the mystery of life and its stupendous labor of evolution-a feeling perhaps most plainly and profoundly expressed by Spinoza : " The more man understands individual objects , the more he understands God .
