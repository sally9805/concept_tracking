txt LONDON , Oct. ** all the criticism that has been voiced by Conservatives against the Labor Government 's foreign policy in the electoral campaign little change in this policy is to be expected if the people of Britain call upon Winston Churchill to form a government on Oct. 25 . Not only is this the view of the handful of Conservative party leaders who enjoy the confidence of Mr. Churchill but it is the considered judgment of foreign diplomats here whose responsibility it is to inform their governments of any impending shifts in the course of British foreign relations . However , there are some interesting nuances in the manner in which the Conservatives would apply current British policies . Neither Mr. Churchill nor Anthony Eden believes that force should have been used by Britain in Iran or that a resort to arms is the solution for the present dispute with Egypt . By a " strong " and " firm " // policy they mean a consistent policy , and this they feel the present Government , with Herbert Morrison as Foreign Secretary , has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , a Conservative government could be expected to show more warmth to Pakistan than to India while working quietly for a reconciliation between Israel and her neighbor states . - And in Near Eastern affairs generally , Britain would insist on a voice at least equal to that of the United States . Although there seems to be a general belief here that a British government under Mr. Churchill would be less implacable and more compliant with United States wishes , there seems to be little basis for it . On the contrary , while Anglo-American relations would be handled with more urbanity than the Labor Government has shown recently , the probability is that while yielding gracefully to American wishes in minor matters a Churchill government would pursue an even more distinctly British line . Mr. Churchill seems to feel that his enormous prestige in the United States would enable him to do this and at the same time seek and re ceive more United States help in the difficult economic period that lies ahead . The government line would probably be that United States dollars coupled with the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish far more than the dollars all by themselves , although it hardly would be expressed quite that crudely . Recognition to Peiping In the Far East a Conservative government , while liking the Communists no better than the Truman Administration , would continue to give recognition to the People 's Republic of China . While willing to go along with the Japanese peace treaty , a Conservative government would probably enact legislation to protect British industry from " unfair " competition with the low-paid , labor of Japan . In Europe the Conservatives would give ' lukewarm support to German rearmament , agree to the creation of a European army to which they would , however , contribute nothing much beyond advice . They would give verbal support to ideas for European unity but would probably find as many practical obstacles to its realization as the Labor Government has done . The cornerstone of Conservative British foreign policy would be unity with the Empire and , of course , the preservation of Empire preferences , the system by which producers throughout the Commonwealth enjoy a place in the competitive scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would also , of course , strive for closer ties with the United States as equal partners in any alliance and continue to support the United Nations .
