txt The two day search for Richard Zahn , 23/2 , ended yesterday when his body was found in the north branch of the Chicago river , about two blocks from his trailer home at 6671 Harts rd. , Niles . The first examination indicated the boy had fallen into the river and drowned . The body was clad in the T shirt , blue pants , and white shoes that Richard wore when he wandered into the Caldwell woods of the forest preserves on Friday . The body was found by Meths Booth , 28 , route 1 , Norwood Park , and Stock Pemberton , 45 , Negro , 1740 Leland ay. , Evanston , forest preserve rangers detailed to aid in the search . Lodged in Underbrush The body was lodged in underbrush at the north side of a fallen tree about five feet from shore . The water is three feet deep at that point , half a mile south of the Harts rd , bridge . Eight rangers had been sent for another search of specific areas preparatory to a general scouring of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niles police , and a bloodhound . Booth and Pemberton were assigned to search along the river bank . They were probing at the water 's edge with long poles when Booth came upon Richard 's body , screened from view by the underbrush and covered with mud . May Have Followed Trail Lt. Daniel Conway of the forest preserve rangers skid the river is so shallow at the point where the body was found that it was unlikely Richard fell in there . Unless Richard tried to wade into the river at that spot , Conway said , it appeared probable that he followed a trail paralleling the river near his home and fell into the water nearer the bridge . Richard 's mother , Shirley , 21 , was preparing dinner for the family when the boy vanished Friday . Her husband , Valores , 24 , a punch press operator , was not at home at the time .
