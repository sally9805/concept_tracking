txt Newbold Morris , who was appointed assistant attorney general to investigate corruption in the National Government , declared yesterday that he would ask President Truman to dismiss any Federal employe who refused to answer a questionnaire on his activities , 25,000 of which he has already dispatched . He said the President had promised him full cooperation and he fully expected the dismissal of such employes . Asked , however , what he would do if Mr. Truman declined to take disciplinary action against those who refused to answer his questionnaires , Mr. Morris smiled and said slowly , " If he does n't , I 'll come home . " Asked whether he believed that 1Mr . Truman was sincere in the clean-up drive , the New Yorker , a Republican , said he felt the President was " heart and soul " behind it . He admitted he did not know Mr. Truman 's motives for ordering the investigation , then shrugged , punched his palm with his fist , and said : " Who 's to know whether the Angel Gabriel appeared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by-pass the Justice Department in seeking indictments by Federal grand juries on matters uncovered by his inquiry . Lawyers to Be Deputized Mr. Morris said he would ask leading members of the bar to present his findings to the grand juries and that - he would deputize them with powers to seek an indictment . Prosecution after indictment , however , he declared , would be handled by the Attorney General . Mr. Morris made these statements on the television program " Meet the Press , " broadcast by the National Broadcasting Company from studios in the New Amsterdam Theatre on Forty-second Street . A panel of New York reporters served , as questioners . The jaunty-looking New York lawyer appeared fairly at ease during his broadcast . He admitted that he was " lonely " in his new job and that he was having a hard time filling his staff . He said he expected to have a staff of 150 to 180 persons , but said ruefully that thus far he had only twenty clerical aides and a few lawyers and consultants . Mr. Morris said he had moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over by myself for a week . " He said the change had taken place after a conference he had with the President . In explaining his plans for bringing his findings before grand juries , Mr. Morris said he himself would decide whom to prosecute . " I will find a leading member of the bar in the cities in this country where there 's been misconduct in Federal office , and ask that leader of the bar or give him authority to go before a Federal grand jury to seek an indictment , " he said . " The prosecution , of course , will have to be conducted by the District Attorney in that district . " Mr. Morris emphasized : " I am working for the American people and I will report to the American people through the President . " Asked how high he would go in demanding dismissal of Federal officeholders , whether he would go as high as the Cabinet , he said : " What 's so wonderful about a Cabinet official ? He 's no different than a Police Commissioner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Immunity No Problem On the question of granting immunity to witnesses , Mr. Morris explained that a Federal grand jury or a prosecutor had exactly such powers , and they were therefore not a main problem of the investigation . Asked if he would have kept former Mayor O'Dwyer of New York in his post as United States Ambassador to Mexico after the Senate Crime Investigation Committee 's revelations about his connections , he said that he never would have appointed him . He also said that he never would have had Maj. Gen. Harry H. Vaughan , military aide to Presi- , dent Truman , who has been ac- , cused of using his influence in ' Federal circles , on the Presidential ) payroll . Reminded that General Vaughan had not ' been dismissed after the accusations , Mr. Morris remarked : " Not yet . " On the charge that Mr. Morris ' law firm had helped to devise transactions in Goverment-owned surplus tankers , first acquired by a group headed by ' Joseph E. Casey , former Democratic Representative from Massachusetts , and later disposed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a philanthropic organization of which Mr. Morris is president , he explained : " These young Chinese engineers who got their degree , ? their doctorate degrees at American institutions , having graduated , of course could n't go home after the China upset . They 're still here . They were really representatives of the Nationalist Government in trying to obtain tankers , and they had the original equity and advanced the funds which were necessary to organize the united tanker group . " And they came to me an asked me to be president of a foundation , and I in turn asked Dr. Magnus , Gregorson , who is head of the De- ' partment of Physiology at Columbia , and who had experience in China and nutrition problems , and Dr. Edward Hume , former president of Yale in China . " And then our fourth trustee is Arthur M. Tode who is former president of the Propeller Club , and set up the maritime school for the Maritime Service . Now the four of us award fellowships and scholarships to Chinese students in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asked if the young Chinese engineers had got the money with which to make . the deal from the Nationalist Government , Mr. Morris said : " No , $1,500,000 came as an advance from the Chinese Petroleum Corporation . That could be all paid off now if it were not for the fact that one of the ships , the Meacham , was seized and is today in court ? not the ship is in court because it was sold  --  but the proceeds of the ' sale of the ship are in court ? 41,950,000  --  and that is a test case on whether you have citizen con- , trol , whether foreign capital impairs the citizenship quality of the corporation . " He said he would probably inves- , tigate the tanker deal and the ' Maritime Administration . In addition to the television program 's regular moderator , Miss Martha Rountree , Mr. Morris was questioned on aspects of his inquiry by Lawrence Spivak , a regular panel member ; Warren Moscow of THE NEW YORK TIMES , Murray ** of The World-Telegram and Sun and Inez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
