txt ? President Eisenhower will fly back to Washington tomorrow to take personal , on-the-spot charge of United States policy in the tense Middle Eastern situation . He will meet tomorrow afternoon with Secretary of State Dulles , and Wednesday morning with Democratic and Republican leaders of Congress . The crisis at issue is the refusal of Israel to withdraw her troops from the Gulf of Aqaba area and the Gaza Strip without advance guarantees . She wishes guarantees that her shipping will not be barred from the Gulf of Aqaba by Egypt and that future guerrilla raids against her from the Gaza area will be prevented . Whether the meeting with Congressional leaders foreshadowed some new request to Congress for authority was not indicated in advance by the White House .

General Eisenhower served public notice last night that the United States was unwilling to make any further concessions to Israel to obtain the troop withdrawal the latter 's Government has been unwilling to make so far .
