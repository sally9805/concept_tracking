Roman Catholics of South America and those of North America approach their faith from highly different points of view . So says Jesuit Theologian Gustave Weigel of Woodstock College , who taught at Chile 's Universidad Catolica from 1937 to 1948 . Writing in Notre Dame 's Review of Politics , Weigel says that the Northerner believes that " life is for work , with the work occasionally interrupted with leisure so that future work be more efficient . " To the Latino , " life is for leisure , interrupted occasionally with work so that leisure itself be possible . " Latin American students in U.S. Roman Catholic universities , says Jesuit Weigel. are constantly complaining to him that Catholicism in the U.S. is " banal and too pedestrian . When a Latin American listens to a sermon , he wants to enjoy it with deep feeling ... I have seen Latin American boys who entered into almost ecstatic converse with Christ after Communion , though they skipped all parts of the Mass other than the Communion . . . " <P> The Spanish Americans , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick in their perceptions and brilliant in their conceptions . " The Latino also tends to combine the romantic loftiness of Don Quixote with the earthy unscrupulousness of Sancho Panza . He has genius for wholehearted friendship , and this is what U.S. statesmen should appeal to . But " on the level of mundane existence he is prone to be a refined or crude sensualist . He needs material things for life , but he is not squeamish how they are to be acquired . Since leisure , high speculation and ecstacy mean so much to him , he is coldly indifferent to how the material needs of life are to be achieved . If it requires the exploitation of a different class , he exploits his neighbor without any feeling of guilt . "
