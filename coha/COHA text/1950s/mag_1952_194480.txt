Before college football adopted some professional standards , a forward passer had to be five yards back of the line of scrimmage . Before that , two incomplete passes in a row drew a 5-yd. penalty . Nowadays , a sleight-of-hand T-quarterback may pitch right from the line of scrimmage ; he may also flip four failures in a row without penalty-though his coach might have something to say about that . The new rules deliberately encourage a more open style of play , and good passers have popped up all over the football map this year . Key men in the T-formation , they can make a poor team better than average , a good team great , and , on a bad day . they can also make an average team look helpless . Some of the best went to battle last week , with varying results . <P> Holy Cross 's Charlie Maloy , the " passingest " player in Eastern football history , tossed two touchdown passes in a snowstorm to down Colgate , 13-7 , and keep his team 's Bowl hopes alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was pitching against the East 's best pass defense . He completed 10 out of 13 for 119 yds. , running his three-year record for passing gains to more than two miles . <P> On the other side of the continent , Washington 's Don Heinrich , the Pacific Coast Conference 's leading passer , who in 1950 held the intercollegiate mark of 60.7% completions in one season , sparked his team to a 22-7 upset of California . Husky ( 6 ft. 1 in. , 178 Ibs . ) Heinrich carried the ball himself for one score , and earned two more points on a freak play : a California man nabbed a Heinrich pass and fell over his own goal line for a safety . <P> Michigan State 's Tom Yewcic and his aptly named understudy , Willie Thrower , tossed only seven passes between them but completed five , two for touchdowns , as the nation 's top-ranked team whipped Indiana on a muddy field , 41-14 . <P> But when one of these key men has an unlucky day , as one did last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has already shattered six Ivy League passing records and whose 16-seconds-to-go pass tied Army , was undone by hard-charging Dartmouth defenders . With Price completing only 9 out of 27 for 40 yds. , Columbia lost , 38-14 . <P> Maryland 's Jack Scarbath , touted as the best bet for All-America quarterback honors , enjoyed the easiest day of all . The nation 's No. 2 team had an open date . <P> Other results last week : <P> California 's two unbeaten football titans won easily . U.S.C. plowed Stanford under , 54-7 , and U.C.L.A. chewed up Oregon State , 57-0 , to pave the way for the upcoming clash between these Rose Bowl aspirants . Georgia Tech , the nation 's No. 3 team , overpowered Army , 45-6 ; Notre Dame outgamed fourth-ranked Oklahoma , 27-21 ; Navy surprised Duke , 16-6.
