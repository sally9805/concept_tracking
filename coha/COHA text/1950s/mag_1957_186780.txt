What they did was not done for profit or material success , for pleasure or power or selfishness . In fact , the whole effort made sense only as an attempt of people to pull together for someone else 's child , on the principle of our common humanity . <P> Thus , echoing scores of editorials across the country , wrote New York Post Pundit Max Lerner last month when a gallant band of rescuers worked around the clock to pull seven-year-old Benny Hooper Jr . out of a well shaft at Manorville , L.I . ( TIME , May 27 ) . One of that gallant band was the Eastport volunteer fire department 's physician . Dr. Joseph H. Kris . Called in by police , he stood by for almost 24 hours , supervising the piping of oxygen to the trapped boy . <P> For a week after the rescue . Dr. Kris -a former G.P. who now specializes in anesthesiology-visited Benny at Bayview Hospital until the boy recovered from a touch of pneumonia . He was photographed with Benny and widely praised for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 58 , rudely shocked the U.S. , which tends to hero-worship its doctors , by sending Mr. and Mrs. Benjamin Hooper Sr. a bill for professional services . The Hoopers make $5,460 a year , he as a highway department truck driver , she as a telephone operator . Amount of the bill : $1,500 . <P> Matter of Ethics . Kent and Borghild Hooper , who had learned about the press and TV during their ordeal , called in reporters . In the resulting uproar , Kris explained : " The time I put in was eight full days and close to 100 hours . My time is worth $30 an hour . I 've given the service . It was a personal sacrifice to me . " Furthermore , he thought he was merely following the widespread medical practice of charging ( within limits ) what the traffic will bear : he had heard that the Hoopers had got a lot of money in donations . Not so , retorted the Hoopers ; they had only got $2,400 , had given $1,000 to the Manorville fire department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he would not " crowd " the Hoopers , but eventually , if they refused to pay , he intended to turn the bill over to a collection agency . <P> In short order , the medical profession was defending its own ethics and condemning Kris . Said Illinois ' Dr. Edwin S. Hamilton , chairman of the A.M.A. 's board of trustees : " Not one doctor in a thousand would have charged a fee . We strongly disagree with the action of the doctor . " * Said the head of the American College of Surgeons , Dr. Paul Hawley : " A terrible thing . " <P> Question of Principle . Connecticut 's Republican Senator William A. Purtell went farther . Said he : " If this doctor must exact the last pound of flesh from the practice of his profession , " citizens generally should raise a fund to pay the bill . " I am willing , " added Purtell , " out of the outrage to my soul , to subscribe the first $50 . " But , said Dr. Kris , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of principle . " <P> At week 's end the mediation committee of Long Island 's Suffolk County Medical Society announced after a three-hour session that because Dr. Kris had been under a " mistaken impression " regarding " the limits of the family 's ability to pay , " there would be no bill for the Hoopers . However , lest a dangerous precedent be set , the committee took pains to note : " Any doctor has the right to render a bill for his service . "
