I. 0. , on July 1 in the event the union and the Board of Transportation are unable to come to an agreement . The Board of Estimate members were called to the meeting by telephone in the Mayor 's absence . Mr. Impellitteri was upstate and was not expected back in the city until tomorrow . ' Presumably his plan ? details of which were not available  --  was worked out with his transit adviser , Edward , sometime late last week . The Mayor 's decision to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position as expressed on Friday . EY LEVEY At that time in an attack on both the Board of Transportation and the union , he indicated strongly that he Wanted no . part of the problem . Earlier yesterday Michael J. Quill , president of the transport union , demanded that the Mayor step into the crisis . In a reply to the Mayor 's statement of the day before , Mr. Quill said that transit was the Mayor 's job and that the union had a right to expect that he would intervene . Mr. Quill 's declaration came in reply to a " plague o ' both your houses " statement by the Mayor on Friday that rebuked both the board and the union , insisted that they resume reasonable negotiations and indicated a complete unwillingness on the Mayor 's part to become involved . To the Mayor 's statement the union leader replied : " The Mayor has a chance now to step into this picture . It 's his // job and his responsibility . And if he wants to prevent a strike on July 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to make it clear that any settlement of the transit crisis would have to be worked out in City Hall and not at the offices of the Board of Transportation in Brooklyn , despite Mr. Impellitteri 's reluctance to be drawn into the problem . " We will deal with the board , of course , " Mr. Quill said . " We are willing to negotiate with anyone on this question . But this is the Mayor 's job . It 's his assignment . " Tomorrow morning Mr. Quill , Matthew Guinan , head of the union 's New York Local 100 , and other officers will , meet with the board . Mr. Quill said he would press for the union 's full package of demands . At that time the board may have an answer as to the cost and feasibility of the program submitted last week .

" Let them the Mayor and Board of Estimate find the money as well as they can . " More Problems For Board Mr. Quill 's attitude had - the effect of cutting some more of the ground out from under the board in its dealings with the union . Thus the three-man board found itself in the position of suffering blows from both . the Mayor , who indicated his dissatisfaction with the way things had been going on Friday , and from the union , with which it has , to bargain .

The Mayor was said to feel that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the board 's bargaining position ? and ultimately the Mayor 's ? virtually untenable . The board already has offered ? and had spurned by the union  --  the following concessions : Releasing the union from its obligation under the memorandum of agreement that members would surrender 11 cents an hour , or $4.84 to $5.28 a week in wages when the shorter work-week became effective ; abandoning the $365,000 report submitted on the finances of transition to the shorter schedule , and'agreeing to make no dismissals in connection with revised work schedules . Mr. Quill repeated yesterday his willingness to work out the new schedule of hours with the board for as long as it might take but insisted that all workers not put on shorter hours immediately be paid at the rate of time-and-a-half for eight hours beginning July 1 . Want ' Painless ' Strike At the union 's half-day work stoppage and demonstration outside City Hall on Friday Mr. Quill declared that if subway workers went on strike July 1 they would ask that their vacations begin as of July 2 , thus making the shutdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny , Mr. Quill said : " Certainly not . Under the memorandum of agreement 98 per cent of the men are entitled to two to three weeks vacation . This is like pension money piled up by a company that 's likely to go out of business . The average man wants his money  --  and his vacation  --  when he can get it . " Most of the men , he said , would " not mind too much " being off over the July 4 week-end . And none , he added , would mind striking if the strike were really a vacation . Under the State 's CondonWadlin act , defied many times by the transport union , city , state and Government employes are prohibited from striking under threat of reprisal .
