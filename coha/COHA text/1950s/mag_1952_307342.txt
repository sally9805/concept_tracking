From Hearst 's New York Journal-American Westbrook Pegler 's terrible-tempered column was conspicuously missing one day last week . Reason : as often happens , the column was deemed too hot to print . <P> Other papers like McCormick 's Washington Times-Herald and Hearst 's Detroit Times did run the column , and the specific reason for the Journal-American 's silence was plain . <P> Three weeks ago , while he was on a European trip , Pegler reported that in Rome he had delivered an eye-opening report to the Vatican 's " highest authority " on union labor and the " criminality and autocratic rule of American unions . " His anonymous authority was so impressed with what he had to say that " he said it would be beneficial if I would write for the Holy Father a statement of the truth in care of the Papal Secretary of State . " <P> As soon as it read of Pegler 's lecture , the Catholic Welfare Conference News Service fired off a query to its Vatican correspondent . Last week it sent out the reply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the News Service : " Official sources in the Vatican stated categorically that no Holy See official has been authorized to treat with anyone concerning union problems . . . The same sources had no knowledge whatever of the possibility of the so-called ' official ' mentioned in the Westbrook Pegler story , and they disavowed any Holy See association with the Pegler attack on U.S. unions and union leaders . " <P> Pegler swung right back with his usual fury . Wrote he : The Catholic News Service " agents are either liars or such bad reporters that they can not verify a fact which could easily be verified on their own beat . . . I will stake my word against any man , whatever his office . " In Rome , an official spokesman again said that 1 ) the Vatican had no knowledge of Pegler 's ever talking with any high official , and 2 ) there is no such thing as a Vatican specialist on labor matters . Perhaps , said the Vatican spokesman charitably , Pegler talked to some priest or monsignor , who either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite and asked Pegler for a report on labor to get rid of him .
