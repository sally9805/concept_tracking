( See Cover ) <P> The onetime Philadelphia lawyer seemed strangely out of place among the fierce-eyed , quick-fingered , nerve-torn bridge experts competing for the Life Masters Pair Gold Cup at Miami Beach 's Americana Hotel . In a game whose fascinating frustrations can bring out the worst of man 's nature , he remained bland and smiling . In a game where a peek can be worth two finesses , he carelessly held his hand within easy view of roving eyes . He actually treated kibitzers as humans ( " I might as well love them . I 'm married to them " ) , and he went out of his way to describe his partner , a perky strawberry blonde named Helen Sobel , as one of the world 's greatest bridge players-which she is . As the tournament neared its end , with tensions and tempers rising , he occasionally took advantage of being dummy to rest his eyes , almost as if snoozing . He was obviously out of his element in one of the most competitive of all pastimes . <P> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 57 , brilliantly aided and abetted by Helen Sobel , had again won one of bridge 's most coveted titles . And last week , reflecting on that victory , he finally permitted himself to show the hard competitive instinct that lies close beneath his amiable surface . " I gave my rivals a good swift kick in the stomach , " said Charles Goren , " and they hated it . " <P> On the Pinnacle . That same competitive instinct took Charlie Goren , driven by poverty and a desperate desire for recognition , to the very top of the world 's bridge players , and it has kept him there for years . Whether measured by master points awarded in tournaments ( 5,791 ) , trophies ( some 2,000 ) , income ( about $150,000 a year , more than any other five bridge experts combined ) , fame ( he is a household word wherever bridge is played ) or influence ( his bidding system is used around the world ) , Bachelor Goren is the king of the bridge aces . " If I stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total , " nobody could catch up with me for five years-at least . " <P> Goren 's bridge books have sold 3,500,000 copies in the U.S. alone , have been translated into eight foreign languages . His seven-days-a-week bridge column appears in 194 U.S. newspapers with a combined circulation of 26 million , and in foreign papers from Manila to Johannesburg . Of the U.S. 's 1,000 fulltime professional bridge teachers , more than 90% teach the Goren system of bidding . <P> On his towering pinnacle of bridge success , Charlie Goren has plenty to keep him busy , aside from playing bridge : his syndicated column ( he writes it himself , in longhand ) , a regular department in SPORTS ILLUSTRATED , trips abroad as a sort of U.S. ambassador to overseas bridgedom , 10,000 letters a year from bridge fans ( many include ticklish bridge problems , but with the help of his staff he answers them all ) , and a venture called Goren Enterprises , which licenses manufacture of such items as a card-table cover with rules of the game printed on it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master .
