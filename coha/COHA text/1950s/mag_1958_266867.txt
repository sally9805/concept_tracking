Some U.S. businessmen do not believe that the economy will turn upward in 1958 . Last week Walter E. Hoadley Jr. , treasurer of Armstrong Cork Co. and a top building-industry economist , gave his reasons for this view to the New York Society of Security Analysts . Said Hoadley : " I do not see evidence of a quick upturn . " The recession will last " through 1960 . It is more than a rolling readjustment . " <P> Hoadley called the recession " an interim " between the great boom that ended last summer and another great boom that he expects will begin in the early 1960s . " It is likely to be difficult , " he said , " to come out of this very rapidly . " His reasons : 1 ) the artificial backlog of pent-up postwar demand has been satisfied ; 2 ) the population boom is over for at least five years because of the low Depression-years ' birth rate ; 3 ) expenditures for new plants and equipment are likely to continue downward because of the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installment buying have changed ( " It is popular now to avoid debt " ) . <P> What is needed now , said Hoadley , is to restore confidence in the U.S. economy . He called for new incentives to the public to begin buying hard goods again " for their own selfish good " and tangible evidences of business improvement that go beyond a seasonal pickup . Most of all , the public must get the feeling that the worst is over or that , at least , it will not be too bad . " We are not being pessimistic , but realistic . The greatest possible danger is a secondary shock wave later this year or in 1959 when the good news fails to come in. "
