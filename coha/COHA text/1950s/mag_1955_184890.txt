Wildly cheered by flag-waving crowds , a lean , leathery man in an olive-green army uniform rode triumphantly into Buenos Aires one sunny day last week to take over as President of Argentina . The new headman was General Eduardo Lonardi ( see box ) , leader of the rebellion that brought Juan Pern tumbling down . <P> After the swearing-in ceremony in the pink Government House , church bells tolled and ship sirens shrilled in celebration . Lonardi stepped onto the balcony from which Pern used to harangue his mobs . In a level tone strikingly different from Pern 's superheated oratory , the new President promised his huge , joyful audience a " rule of law , " freedom of assembly and of the press ( see PRESS ) . " Argentina " General Lonardi said , " has given the world the first example of an absolute totalitarian government falling before the just and honorable reaction of the people . " <P> Fallen Dictator Juan Pern , taking the beaten track of most toppled Latin American strongmen , had asked the Buenos Aires embassy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 636-ton river gunboat Paraguay , and in that cramped refuge Juan Peron waited , his power to make Argentine history broken and dissolved . <P> <P> Happy Birthday . " The strongman fell with dramatic suddenness . As the fateful week opened , the government propaganda machine was still repetitiously insisting that the rebellion was about to collapse , that loyalist troops had retaken the rebel stronghold of Crdoba . But Peron 's government , not the rebellion , was about to collapse . <P> At the start , the rebel leaders ( notified by prearranged " Happy Birthday " telegrams that the time to strike had come ) commanded only a few thousand men . They seemed little more dangerous to Pern &; Co. than the June 16 rebellion , snuffed out in six hours by inner-circle generals guarding their vested interests in the Pern regime . But this time rebel leaders showed spectacular dime-novel pluck and luck . While Generals Lonardi and Videla Balaguer were holding Crdoba , Vice Admiral Isaac Rojas daringly boarded the navy 's flagship cruiser , locked the Peronista fleet commander in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am not going to deceive anybody , " messaged Rojas . " We are going to make a revolution , and they may kill us all . Anybody who does not want to sail with us may go ashore . " Out of 2,300 navy men aboard the warships all but 90 chose to sail with Rojas . <P> In the inland city of San Luis , Rebel General Julio Lagos stalked into the headquarters of General Jose Maria Sosa Molina , who had replaced him as commander of the Second Army . " Who gives orders here , me or Sosa Molina ? " thundered tough General Lagos . With that , the key Second Army , controlling three interior provinces , was on the rebel side . <P> First Day of Spring . By the fourth day , much of the interior was under rebel control , and a powerful fleet under Rojas was in the River Plate threatening to bombard the capital unless Pern quit . As a warning of what might come , rebel warships stood off the beach-resort city of Mar del Plata , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
