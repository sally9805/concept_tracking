As American Airlines Flight 901 , nonstop from Fort Worth to Los Angeles , winged over Arizona one night last week , Passenger Francis A. Nixon , 75 , lapsed into a semicoma , stricken with a gastric hemorrhage . Captain Joe Glass , the plane 's veteran pilot , radioed for an ambulance and landed the DC-6 at Phoenix . Minutes later , Frank Nixon was receiving blood transfusions at St. Joseph 's Hospital . The patient 's son , Vice President Richard M. Nixon , was promptly notified , although his mother Hannah Nixon hated " to distress him right now when he has so much on his mind . " <P> Secret Pencilings . On Dick Nixon 's mind was the secret report he would deliver to the next morning 's National Security Council meeting . For three days he had closeted himself in a secluded Capitol office , writing observations of and conclusions from his ten-week inspection of the Far and Near East . At the meeting , the NSC 's 177th , Nixon pulled the penciled results from a file folder , read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was he said , it made a good impression : his audience , consisting of the President , four Cabinet members , the Chiefs of Staff and other top officials , clapped . Never before had the NSC 's members burst into a shower of applause . <P> That evening , indefatigable Dick Nixon made a second report , this time to the people . Over a half-hour nationwide radio-TV hookup , in his chatty manner , the Vice President described the problems and aspirations of Asian peoples , and their vulnerability to Communism . He said : " We shook hands with over 100,000 people . . . Why see these ordinary people ? . . . We wanted them to know America , and we wanted to know them . " Nixon recalled that the " very wise and very young " King of Siam had summed up his people 's needs : military assistance , economic assistance and understanding . " Significantly enough , he told me that understanding was the most important of the three . " <P> Dirty Word . Traveler Nixon reported " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " There are millions of people in this area of the world who honestly believe in their hearts that the U.S. is just as great a threat to peace as are the Soviet Union and Communist China . . . We are not getting our message across . " He added that the Eisenhower Administration is finally " bringing to the world the true picture of American power . " <P> Turning to Indo-China , Nixon , neatly pinning on the Communists the dirty word " colonialism , " said : " The U.S. supports the Associated States of Indo-China in their understandable aspiration for independence , but we know that if the French leave Indo-China . . . the forces of Communist colonialism . . . would enslave them . " <P> The rejection of Communism by the overseas Chinese , Nixon found , is " one of the most spectacular developments " in Asia . " What are the reasons ? " he asked himself , and answered : " I talked to a farmer ... He told me how he , his wife and two small children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China until they arrived at the Hong Kong border . . . The reason was that his only brother was blind . . . He could n't produce as much as the Communists required . . . The Communists took him away and shot him . "
