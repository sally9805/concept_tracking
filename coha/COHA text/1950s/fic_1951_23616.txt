Monte Saint Angelo A Story by Arthur Miller Drawings by Edward Me ! carth T HE driver , who had been sitting up ahead in perfect silence for nearly an hour as they crossed the monotonous green plain of Foggia , now said something . Appello quickly leaned forward in the back seat and asked him what he had said . " That is Monte Saint Angelo before you . " Appello lowered his head to see through the windshield of the rattling little Fiat . Then he nudged Bernstein who awoke resentfully , as though his friend had intruded . " That 's the town up there , " Appello said . Bernstein'sannoyance vanished and he bent forward . They both sat that way for several minutes , watching the approach of what seemed to them a comically situated town , even more comic than any they had seen in the four weeks they had spent moving from place to place in the country . It was like a tiny old lady living on a high roof for fear of thieves . The plain remained as flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then out of it like a pillar rose the butte , squarely and rigidly skyward it towered , only narrowing as it reached its very top . And there , barely visible now , the town crouched , momentarily obscured by white clouds , then appearing again tiny and safe , like a mountain port looming at the end of the sea . From their distance they could make oub no road , no approach at all up the side of the pillar . " Whoever built that was awfully frightened of something , " Bernstein said , pulling his coat closer around him . " How do they get up there ? Or do they ? " Appal ? , in Italian , asked the driver about the town . The driver , who had been there only once before in his life and knew no other who had made the trip  --  despite his being a resident of Lucera which was not far away  --  told Appello with some amusement that they would soon see how rarely anyone goes up or comes down Monte Saint Angelo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when we come into the town everyone will come out to see . They are very far from everything . They all look like brothers up there . They do n't know very much either , " he laughed . " What does the Princeton chap say ? " Bernstein asked . The driver had a crew haircut , a turned-up nose , and a red round face with blue eyes . He owned the car , and although he spoke like any Italian when his feet were on the ground , behind his wheel with two Americans riding behind him he had only the most amused and superior attitude toward everything outside the windshield . Appello , having translated for Bernstein , asked him how long it would take to ascend . " Perhaps three-quarters of an hour  --  as long as the mountain is , " he amended . Bernstein and Appello settled back and watched the butte 's approach . Now they could see that its sides were crumbled white stone . At this closer vantage it seemed as though it had been struck a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into millions of seams . They were beginning to climb now , on a road of sharp broken rocks . " The road is Roman , " the driver remarked . He knew how much Americans made of anything Roman . Then he added , " The car , however , is from Milan . " He and Appello laughed . And now the white chalk began drifting into the car . At their elbows the altitudebegan to seem threatening . There was no railing on the road and it turned back on itself every two hundred yards in order to climb again . The Fiat 's doors were wavering in their frames , the seat on which they sat kept inching forward onto the floor . A fine film of white talc settled onto their clothing and covered their eyebrows . Both together began to cough . When they were finished Bernstein said , " Just so I understand it clearly and without prejudice , will you explain again in words of one syllable why the hell we are climbing this lump of dust , old man ? " Appello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding , " Bernstein said , trying to smile . " I want to see this aunt of mine , that 's all . " Appello began taking it seriously . " You 're crazy , you know that ? You 've got some kind of ancestor complex . All we 've done in this country is look for your relatives . I mean it , you really have a lust for your history , do n't you . " " Well , Jesus , I 'm finally in the country , I want to see all the places I came from . You realize that two of my relatives are buried in a crypt in the church up there ? In 1100 something . " " Oh , is this where the monks came from ? " " Sure , the two Appello brothers . They helped build that church . It 's very famous , that church . Supposed to be Saint Michael appeared in a vision or something . . .. " " I never thought I 'd know anybody with monks in his family . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well do n't ypu have any feeling about your ancestors ? Would n't you like to go back to Austria or wherever you came from and see where the old folks lived ? Maybe find a family that belongs to your line , or something like that ? " B ERNSTEIN did not answer for a moment . He did not know quite what he felt , and wondered dimly whether he kept ragging his friend a little because of envy . When they had been in the country courthouse where Appello 's grandfather 's portrait and his great-grandfather 's hung  --  both renowned provincial magistrates ; when they had spent the night in Lucera where the name Appello meant something distinctly honorable , and where his friend Ninny was MONTE SAINT ANGELO 4/ taken in hand and greeted in that intimate way because he was an Appello  --  in all these moments Bernstein had felt left out and somehow deficient . At first he had taken the attitude that all the fuss was childlike and silly and sentimental , and yet as incident after incident , landmark after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually began to feel his friend combining with this history and it seemed to him that it made Vinny stronger , somehow less dead when the time would come for him to die . " I have no relatives that I know of in Europe , " he said to Vinny . " And if I had they 'd have all been wiped out by now . " is that why you do n't like my visiting this way ? " Vinny asked sympathetically . He was ever trying to know Bernstein , whom he loved and respected , but who was closed to him . Bernstein felt Vinny 's attempt to reach into him . " I do n't say I do n't like it , " he said , and smiled by will . He wished he could open himself like Vinny ; somehow it would give him ease and strength , he felt . They stared down at the plain below , and spoke little . The chalk dust had lightened Appello 's black eyebrows . For a fleeting moment it occurred to Appello that they resembled each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad-shouldered and dark men . Bernstein was thinner , quite gaunt and long-armed . Appello was stronger in his arms and stooped a little as though he had not wanted to be tall . But their eyes were not the same . Appello seemed a little Chinese around the eyes , and they glistened black , direct , and , for women , passionately . Bernstein gazed rather than rooked ; for him the eyes were dangerous when they could be fathomed , and so he turned them away often , or downward , and there teemed to be something defensively cruel and yet gentle there . They liked each other not for - easons so much as for possibilities ; it was as hough they both had sensed they were op3osites , as only two men may know that thing ) f each other . And they were drawn to each 3ther by the lure of the expression which each embodied for the other 's failings . With Berntein around him Appello felt diverted from its irresponsible sensuality , and on this trip 3ernstein often had the pleasure and pain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned a hairpin curve with a loud below on the right , when suddenly themain street of the town arched up before them . There was no one about . It had been true , what the driver had predicted  --  in the few handkerchiefs of grass that they had passed on the way up , the donkeys had bolted , and they had seen shepherds with hard mustaches and black shakos and long black cloaks who had regarded them with the silent inspection of those who live far away . But here in the town there was no one . The car climbed onto the main street which flattened now , and all at once they were being surrounded by people who were coming out of their doors putting on their jackets and caps . They did look strangely related , and more Irish than Italian . The two got out of the Fiat and inspected the baggage strapped to the car 's roof while the driver kept edging around and around the car as though in fear for it . Appello talked laughingly with the people who kept asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell , what he wanted to buy , until he at last made it clear that he was looking only for his aunt . When he said the name the men ( the women remained at home ) looked blank , until an old man wearing rope sandals and a skating cap came forward and said that he remembered such a woman . He then turned and Appello and Bernstein followed up the main street with what was now perhaps a hundred men behind them . " How come nobody knows her ? " Bernstein asked . " She 's a widow , I guess she stays home most of the time . The men in the line died out here twenty years ago . Her husband was the last Appello up here . They do n't go much by women ; I bet this old guy remembered the name because he knew her husband by it , not her . " The wind , steady and hard , blew through the town , washing it , laving its stones white . The sun was cool as a lemon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keels seemed to be sailing through the next street . The two Americans began to walk with the joy of it in their long strides . They came to a two-story stone house and went up a dark corridor and knocked . T HERE was no sound within for a few moments . Then there was . Short scrapes , like a mouse that started , stopped , looked about , started again . Appello knocked once more . The doorknob turned and the door opened a foot . A pale little woman , not very old at all , held the door wide enough for her face to be seen . She seemed very worried . " Ha ? " she asked . " I am Vincent Georgio . " " Ha ? " she repeated . " Vicenzo Georgio Appello . " Her hand slid off the knob and she stepped back . Appello , smiling in his friendly way , entered with Bernstein behind him closing the door . A window let the sun flood the room , which was nevertheless stone cold . The woman 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer and the tips of her fingers were pointing at Vinny . She seemed crouched , as though about to kneel , and she could not speak . Vinny went over to her and touched her shoulder and pressed her to a chair . He and Bernstein sat down too . He told her their relationship , saying names of men and women some of whom were dead , others she had only heard of and never met in this skyplace . She spoke , at last , and Appello could not understand what she said . She ran out of the room suddenly . " I think she thinks I 'm a ghost or something . My uncle said she had n't seen any of the family in twenty or twenty-five years . I bet she does n't think there are any left . . . . " She returned with a bottle that had an inch of wine at the bottom of it . She ignored Bernstein and gave Appello the bottle . He drank . It was vinegar . Then she started to whimper , and kept wiping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appello . She never finished a sentence and Appello kept asking her what she meant . She kept running from one corner of the room to another . The rhythm of her departures and returns to the chair was getting so wild that Appello raised his voice and commanded her to sit . " I 'm not a ghost , Aunty , I came here from America . . . . " He stopped . It was clear from the look in her bewildered , frightened eyes , that she had not thought him a ghost at all , but what was just as bad  --  if nobody had ever come to see her from Lucera , how could anybody have so much as thought of her in America , a place which did exist , she knew , just as heaven existed and in exactly the same way . There was no way to hold a conversation with her . MAGAZINE They finally made their exit , and she had not said a coherent word except a blessing which was her way of expressing her relief that Appello was leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own eyes another of her husband 's blood , the sight was itself too terrible in its associations , and in the responsibility it laid upon her to welcome him and make him comfortable . T HEY walked toward the church now . Bernstein had not been able to say any- thing . The woman 's emotion , so pure and violent and wild , had scared him . And yet , glancing at Appello , he was amazed to set that his friend had drawn nothing but a calm sort of satisfaction from it , as though hi : aunt had only behaved correctly . Dimly h ( remembered himself as a boy visiting an aunt of his in the Bronx , a woman who had no ' been in touch with the family and had never seen him . He remembered how forcefully shd had fed him , pinched his cheeks , and smile ( and smiled every time he looked up at her but he knew that there was nothing of thi blood in that encounter ; nor could there 13 , for him now if on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was of his family . If anything , he would want to get away from her , even though he had always gotten along with his people and had n't even the usual snobbery about them . As they entered the church he said to himself that some part of him was not plugged in , but why he should be disturbed about it mystified him and even made him angry at Appello , who now was asking the priest where the tombs of the Appellos were . They descended into the vault of the church where the stone floor was partly covered with water . Along the walls , and down twisting corridors running out of a central arched hall , were tombs so old no candle could illuminate most of the inscriptions . The priest vaguely remembered an Appello vault but had no idea where it was . Vinny moved from one crypt to another with the candle he had bought from the priest . Bernstein waited at the opening of the corridor , his neck bent to avoid touching the roof with his hat . Appello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , an antiquary , a gradually disappearing figure squinting down the long darkness of the ages for his name on a stone . He could not find it . Their feet were getting soaked . After half an hour they left the church and outside fought off shivering small boys selling grimy religious postcards which the wind kept taking from their fists . " I 'm sure it 's there , " Appello said with fascinated excitement , " but you would n't want to stick out a search , would you ? " he asked hopefully . " This is no place for me to get pneumonia , " Bernstein said . They had come to the end of a side street . They had passed shops in front of which pink lambs hung head down with their legs stiffly jutting out over the sidewalk . Bernstein shook hands with one and imagined for Vinny a scene for Chaplin in which a monsignor would meet him here , reach out to shake his hand , and find the cold lamb 's foot in his grip , and Chaplin would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless sky , and looked over the precipice upon Italy . " They might even have ridden horseback down there , in armor . Appellos . " Vinny spoke raptly . " Yeah , they probably did , " Bernstein said . The vision of Appello in armor wiped away any desire to kid his friend . He felt alone , desolate as the dried-out chalk sides of this broken pillar he stood upon . Who am I ? he wondered . He remembered clearly his father telling of his town in Europe , a common barrel of water , a town idiot , a baron nearby . That was all he had of it , and no pride , no pride in it at all . Then I am an American , he said to himself . And yet in that there was not the power of Appello 's narrow passion . He looked at Appello 's profile , and felt the warmth of that gaze upon Italy and wondered if any American had ever really felt like this in the States . He had never in his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so vivid with generations as it had been with Vinny 's aunt an hour ago . A common water barrel , a town idiot , a baron who lived near by . . It had nothing to do with him . And standing there he felt a broken part of himself ; and wondered with a slight amusement if this was what a child felt on discovering that the parents who have brought him up are not his own and that he entered his house not from warmth , but from the street , from a public and disordered place .. .. T HEY sought and found a restaurant for lunch . It was at the other edge of the town and overhung the precipice . Inside , it was one immense room with fifteen or twenty tables , the front wall lined with windows overlooking the plain below . They sat at a table and waited for someone to appear . The restaurant was cold . They could hear the wind surging against the windowpanes , and yet the clouds at eye-level moved serenely and slow . A young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kitchen and Appello began to question her about food when the door to the street opened and a man came in . For Bernstein there was art abrupt impression of familiarity with the man , although he could not fathom the reason for his feeling . The man 's face was indistinguishable from all Sicilian faces , round , dark as earth , high cheekbones , broad jaw . He almost laughed aloud as it instantly occurred to him that he could converse with this man in Italian . The waitress gone , he told this to Tinny who now joined in watching the man . Sensing their stares . the man looked at them with a merry flicker of his checks , and said , " Bongiorno . " " Bongiorno , " Bernstein replied across the four tables between them . And then to Vinny , " Why do I feel that about him ? " " I 'll be damned if I know , " Vinny said , glad now that he could join his friend in a mutually interesting occupation . They watched the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large package down on another table , and now put his hat on a chair , his jacket on another chair , and his vest on a third . It was as though he were making companions of his clothing . He was in the prime of middle age and very rugged . And to the Americans there was something mixed up about his clothing . His jacket might have been worn by a local man ; it was tight and black and wrinkled and chalkdustcovered . His trousers were dark brown and very thick , like a peasant 's , and his shoes were snubbed up at the ends and of heavy leather . But he wore a black hat , which was unusual up here where all had caps , and he had a tie . He wiped his hands before loosening the knot for it was a striped tie , yellow and blue , of silk , and not a tie to be bought in this part of the world , nor certainly to be worn by these people . - And there was a look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor did it have the innocence of the other men who had looked at them on the streets here . The waitress came with two dishes of lamb for the Americans . The man was interested and looked across his table at the meat and at the strangers . Bernstein glanced at the barely cooked flesh and said , " There 's hair on it . " Vinny called the girl back just as she was going to the newcomer and pointed at the hair . " But it 's lamb 's hair , " she explained simply . They said oh , and pretended to begin to cut the faintly pink flesh . " You ought to know better , signor , than to order meat today . " The man looked amused , and yet it was unclear whether he might not be a trifle offended . " Why not ? " Vinny asked . " It 's Friday , signor , " and he smiled sympathetically . " That 's right ! " Vinny said , although he had known all along . " Give me fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked with intimacy about her mother who was ill these days . Bernstein had not been able to turn his eyes from the man . He could not eat the meat and sat chewing bread and feeling a rising urge to go over to the man , to speak to him . It struck him as being insane . The whole place , the town , the clouds in the streets , the thin air were turning into an hallucination . He knew this man . He was sure he knew him . But quite clearly that was impossible . But there was a thing beyond the impossibility of which he was drunkenly sure , and it was that he could , if he dared , start speaking Italian fluently with this man . This was the first moment since leaving America that he had not felt the ill-ease of traveling and of being a traveler . He felt as comfortable as Vinny now , it seemed to him . In his mind 's eye he could envisage the inside of the kitchen ; he had a startlingly clear image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew where a certain kind of soiled apron was hung . And yet it was crazy and he knew that something was happening to him that had never happened before . " What 's the matter with you ? " Appello asked . " Why ? " " The way you 're looking at him . " " I want to talk to him . " " Well , talk to him , " Vinny smiled . " I ca n't speak Italian , you know that . " " Well , I 'll ask him whatever you want to know . " " Vinny . " Bernstein started to say something and stopped . " What ? " Appello asked , leaning his head closer and looking down at the tablecloth . " Get him to talk . Anything . Go ahead . " Vinny , enjoying his friend 's strange emotionalism , looked up at the man who now was eating with careful but immense satisfaction . " Scuze , signor . " The man looked up . " I am a son of Italy from America . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " The man , chewing deliciously , nodded with his amiable and amused smile , and adjusted the hang of his jacket on the nearby chair . " Do you come from around here ? " " Not very far . " " How is everything here ? " " Poor . It is always poor . " " What do you work at , if I may ask ? " The man had now finished his food . He took one last drag of his wine and got up and proceeded to dress and pull his tie up tightly . When he walked it was with a slow , wide sway , as though each step had to be conserved . " I sell cloth here to the people and the stores , such as they are , " he said . And he walked over to the bundle and set it carefully on a table and began untying it . " He sells cloth , " Vinny said to Bernstein . Bernstein 's cheeks began to redden . From where he sat he could see the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle . He could see the man 's hands working at the knot , and just a corner of the man 's left eye . Now the man was laying the paper away from the two bolts of cloth , carefully pressing the wrinkles flat against the table . It was asthough the brown paper were valuable leather that must not be cracked or rudely bent . The waitress came out of the kitchen with a tremendous round loaf of bread at least two feet in diameter . She gave it to him and he placed it flat on top of the cloth , and the faintest feather of a smile curled up on Bern-stein 's lips . Now the man folded the paper back and brought the string around the bundle and tied the knot , and Bernstein uttered a little laugh , a laugh of relief . Vinny looked at him , already smiling , ready to join the laughter , but mystified . " What 's the matter ? " he asked . Bernstein took a breath . There was something a little triumphant , a new air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though now for the first time it was he who had the private secret and was at home . " He 's Jewish , Vinny , " he said . Vinny turned to look at the man . " Why ? " " The way he works that bundle . It 's ex-actly the way my father used to tie a bundle . And my grandfather . The whole history is packing bundles and getting away . Nobody else can be as tender and delicate with bun-dies . That 's a Jewish man tying a bundle . Ask him his name . " Vinny was delighted . " Signor , " he called , with that warmth reserved in his nature for members of families , any families . The man , tucking the end of the string into the edge of the paper , turned to them with his kind smile . " May I ask your name , signor ? " " My name ? Mauro di Benedetto . " " Mauro di Benedetto . Sure ! " Vinny laughed , looking at Bernstein . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I 'm Jewish , " Bernstein said , a driving eagerness charging his eyes , as though he were going to answer the doorbell to let in a long-awaited friend . " My friend is Jewish , " Vinny said to the man , who now was hoisting the bundle onto his shoulder . " Heh ? " the man asked , confused by their sudden vivacity . As though wondering if there were some sophisticated American point he should have understood , he stood there smiling blankly , politely , ready to join in this mood . " Judeo , my friend . " " Judeo ? " he asked , the willingness to get the joke still holding the smile on his face . Vinny hesitated before this steady gaze of incomprehension . " Judeo . The people of the Bible , " he said . " Oh , yes , yes ! " The man nodded now , relieved that he was not to be caught in ignorance . " ' Ebraio , " he corrected . And he nodded affably to Bernstein and seemed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . " Does he know what you mean ? " Bernstein asked . " Yeah , he said ' Hebrew ' but it does n't seem to connect . Signor , " he addressed the man , " why do n't you have a glass of wine with us . Come , sit down . " " Thank you , signor , " he replied appreciatively , " but I must be home by sundown and I 'm already a little late . " Vinny translated and Bernstein told him to ask why he had to be home by sundown . The man apparently had never considered the question before . He shrugged , and laughed and said , " I do n't know , all my life I get home for dinner on Friday night and I like to come into the house before sundown . I MAGAZINE suppose it 's a habit ; my father . .. you see , I have a route I walk , which is this route . I first did it with my father , and he did it with his father  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father always got home on Friday night before sundown . It 's a manner of the family I guess . " " Shabbas begins at sundown on Friday night , " Bernstein said when Vinny translated . " He 's even taking home the fresh bread for Sabbath . The man is a Jew , I tell you . Ask him , will ya ? " " Scuze , signor , " Vinny smiled , " my friend is curious to know whether you are Jewish . " The man raised his thick eyebrows not only in surprise , but as though he felt somewhat honored by being identified with something exotic . " Me ? " he asked . " I do n't mean American , " Vinny said , believing he had caught the meaning of the man 's glance at Bernstein . " ' Ebraio , " he repeated . The man shook his head seeming a little sorry he could not oblige Vinny . " No , " he said . He was ready to go but wanted to pursue what obviously was his most interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrews ? " " He 's asking me if Jews are Catholics , " Vinny said . Bernstein sat back in his chair , a knotted look of wonder in his eyes . Vinny replied to the man who looked once again at Bernstein as though wanting to investigate this strangeness further , but his mission drew him up and he wished them good fortune and said good-by . He walked to the kitchen door and called thanks to the girl inside , saying the loaf would warm his back all the way down the mountain , and he opened the door and went out into the wind of the street and the sunshine , waving to them as he walked away . T HEY kept repeating their amazement on the way back to the car , and Bernstein told again how his father wrapped bundles . " Maybe he does n't know he 's a Jew , but how could he not know what Jews are ? " he said . " Well , remember my aunt in Lucera ? " Vinny asked . " She 's a schoolteacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't know the first thing about it . I think the ones in these small towns who ever heard of Jews think they 're a Christian sect of some kind . I knew an old Italian once who thought all Negroes were Jews and white Jews were only converts . " " But his name .. . " " Benedetto is an Italian name too . I never heard of Mauro though . Mauro is strictly from the old sod . " " But if he had a name like that would n't it lead him to wonder if . . . ? " " I do n't think so . In New York the name Salvatore is turned into Sam . Italians are great for nicknames , the first name never means much . Vicenzo is Erwo or Vinny or even Chico . Nobody would think twice about Mauro or damn near any other first name . He 's obviously a Jew , but I 'm sure he does n't know it . You could tell , could n't you ? He was baffled . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bernstein laughed , wide-eyed . They reached the car and Bernstein had his hand on the door but stopped before opening it and turned to Vinny . He looked heated , his eyelids seemed puffed . " It 's early ; if you still want to I 'll go back to the church with you . You can look for the boys . " Vinny began to smile , and then they both laughed together , and Tinny slapped him on the back and gripped his shoulder as though to hug him . " Goddam , now you 're starting to enjoy this trip ! " They walked briskly toward the church , the conversation returning always to the same point when Bernstein would say , " I do n't know why , but it gets me . He 's not only acting like a Jew , but an orthodox Jew . And does n't even know . . . I mean it 's strange as hell to me . " " You look different , you know that ? " Vinny said . " Why ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bernstein said quietly , as they entered the church and descended into the vault beneath it . " I feel like ... at home in this place . I ca n't describe it . " They picked their way through the shallower puddles on the stone floor looking into vestibules , opening doors , searching for the priest . He appeared at last , they could not imagine from where , and Appello bought another candle from him and was gone in the shadows of the corridors where the vaults were . Bernstein stood  --  everything was wet , dripping . Behind him , flat and wide , rose the stairway of stones bent with the tread of millions . Vapor steamed from his nostrils . There was nothing to look at but shadow . It was dank and black and low , an entrance to hell . Now and then in the very far distance he could hear a step , another , then silence . He did not move , seeking the root of an ecstasy he had not dreamed was part of his nature ; he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across the plains , on routes marked out for him by generations of men , a nameless traveler carrying home a warm bread on Friday night  --  and kneeling in church on Sunday . There was an irony in it he could not name . And yet pride was running through him like a narrow and cool trickle of water . Of what he should be proud he had no idea ; perhaps it was only that under the glacial crush of history a Jew had survived , had been shorn of his consciousness , but still held on to that final impudence of a Saturday Sabbath and a fresh bread . There was a smile on Bernstein 's face and he was almost laughing , but he wished he could know why he was proud and why his mind invited the feeling . He could see Vinny 's form between the walls of crypts , coming toward him with springy step . And he knew that now for the first time he would look straight into Vinny 's eyes , as though he had been newly joined with something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him smiling like a young boy . " It 's back there ! I found it ! " " That 's great , Vinny , " Bernstein said . " I 'm glad . " They walked into the narrow corridor , both stooping , Tinny slightly ahead with the candle raised in one hand , his other grasping Bernstein 's wrist . He had never liked anyone grasping him ; it always seemed like an invasion of privacy . But now he wanted very much to laugh or to sing loudly , because it felt so rich and fine  --  a touch of the hand in the darkness .
