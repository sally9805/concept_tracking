President Sukarno apparently believes that a government that prints money can also take it away . Last week , faced by skyrocketing inflation that had already run the dollar value of the rupiah to 155 on the black market ( against the official rate of 11.4 rupiahs to the dollar ) , Sukarno demanded action from his Finance Ministry . <P> He got it . Overnight all 1,000-and 500-rupiah notes were arbitrarily cut to one-tenth of their value ( though smaller bills were not changed ) ; 90% of every bank deposit over 25,000 rupiahs was frozen , so that the money could be seized for obligatory long-term loans to the government , and banks were closed for two days to straighten out their accounts and report to the government . A new exchange rate of 45 rupiahs to the dollar was proclaimed . All this was done to the accompaniment of denunciations by Sukarno of " vulture capitalists . " Added he : " Whoever scoops up wealth at the expense of the public , whoever disrupts the public economy , will be arrested , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if necessary will be sentenced to death . " <P> The powerful Chinese community , numbering about 2,500,000 and controlling much of the Indonesian economy , was sure that Sukarno 's drastic measures were directed against it . The public seemed to like the idea of soaking the rich and the alien , while leading newspapers agreed that at least something drastic had to be done . But as business , with no capital to operate , ground to a standstill , the first reaction to Sukarno 's bold move was stagnation and frustration .
