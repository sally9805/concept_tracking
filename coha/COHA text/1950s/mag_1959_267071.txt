" Now everyone gets the best seat in the house , " says Conductor Erich Leinsdorf . " That is proper for a democracy , is it not ? " The " best seat " is a living room sofa facing a wall equipped with two speakers six to eight feet apart . If listener and speakers are positioned correctly , there seems to issue from the wall a wave of what is known as stereophonic sound . Nothing has so excited listeners and record makers since , more than a decade ago , the long-playing disk ushered in the Age of High Fidelity . Stereophony 's extra clarity and depth have not had the immediate impact on the public that high-fidelity sound did , but it is a major and startling improvement in home listening . <P> As far as most record buyers were concerned , just a year ago stereo sound was little more than a whisper in a laboratory echo chamber . By the beginning of this year , the stereo disk ( usually $1 more than a comparable monophonic ) accounted for roughly 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may represent a third of the total . But stereo disks are not likely to make the old monophonic disks entirely obsolete , since a well-engineered old-style LP sounds fine when played on stereo . While the sale of monophonic equipment has dwindled to almost nothing , many of the nation 's stereo owners have continued buying monophonic records . <P> The Equipment . Stereo disks are made by feeding sound through three or more separate microphones , with the signals recorded on three separate channels that are later reduced to two . On the record , a single needle picks up separate impulses from each channel by moving both up and down and sideways in a single groove . The two signals from the needle must be played through two separate amplifiers and speakers . Despite the necessary additional equipment , the cost can be far lower than that of a genuine monophonic hi-fi rig , because stereo achieves impressive reproduction with relatively small speakers and low-wattage amplifiers . Hi-fi addicts with component-part rigs can convert to stereo by gradually adding units . <P> Packaged stereo sets all ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portable unit ( the tone is apt to be as strident as a bluejay 's cry ) , or as high as $2,500 . Between the two extremes are dozens of sets in the $100 to $500 range , many of which make for better listening than more expensive monophonic units . Thinking of the already cluttered American living room , manufacturers also offer " self-contained stereo " - units with both speakers housed in a single cabinet . But two-speaker cabinets , unless they are six to eight feet long , can give only an illusion of stereo depth and definition ( what one manufacturer calls " stereotype " sound ) .
