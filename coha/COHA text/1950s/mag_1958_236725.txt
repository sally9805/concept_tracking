WHAT THE SEX MANUALS DO N'T TELL <P> YOU beckoned newspaper ads last week . The commodity on sale : a magazine article offering " penetrating guidance " to " anxious " husbands and wives with " secret worries . " What lifted many eyebrows was not the subject of the article but the magazine that touted it : the staid Reader 's Digest ( world circ. 20 million ) , which for most of its 36 article-packed , circulation-enriching years has delicately skirted the subject it still refers to in chuckly anecdotes as " the facts of life . " <P> Actually , the Digest cracked its boudoir boycott spectacularly in July 1956 with an article called " What Wives Do n't Know About Sex . " A flood of letters from readers suggested that do-it-yourself sex could be as gripping a topic for Digestion as the magazine 's Pollyanna sagas of man against wilderness or science against cancer-the kind of uplift dear to Digest Editor ( and Founder ) DeWitt Wallace , son of a Presbyterian preacher .

If this does not happen easily , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will make it happen . " Yet , soothes Dr. David R. Mace , the how-to-do-it books place " an exaggerated emphasis on so-called ' sexual technique . ' " He reassures readers that the sex manuals are no substitute for old-fashioned passion . His own summary in the Digest 's digest : " So long as the emotional feelings between the couple are right , so long as there is mutual trust and love , their bodies will invariably make the appropriate responses .
