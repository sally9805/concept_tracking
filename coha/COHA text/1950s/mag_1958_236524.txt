SOME CAME RUNNING ( 1,266 pp. ) - James Jones-Scribner ( $7.50 ) . <P> James Jones is the Stanley Kowalski of U.S. letters . Bulked into the sweaty T shirt of latter-day realism , he stirs raw sex , raw talk , raw emotions and raw ideas in a crude vat of the rawest home-brewed English . In From Here to Eternity , this concoction helped put across Novelist Jones 's abrasive vision of a little-known area of U.S. life , the peacetime Regular Army . Steamy with sex , Some Came Running may hit the same one-armed bandit of bestselling success , but it is more than one-third longer ( some 700,000 words in all ) than king-sized Eternity-and three-thirds duller . <P> Dave Hirsh , late-thirtyish mock hero of Running , is that stock figure of much modern fiction , the self-pitying sore head who believes that the world owes him a loving . Dave is a World War II veteran and the author of two minor novels . He has been AWOL from his typewriter for seven years , and Choctaw rather than English would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A person could actually kill themselves that way . " On an alcoholic whim , Dave returns in 1947 to Parkman . Ill. , the hick home town he had deserted 19 years earlier in flight from a paternity charge lodged against him by a hay-prone hoyden . Parkman is Peyton Place transplanted , with more skeletons than it has closets . <P> Pigs in a Brassire Factory . Dave 's father is a salty old reprobate who once ran off with the family doctor 's wife and returned only to booze away his social security money at the local bars . Older brother Frank , acting head of the family , is a canny **25;15497;TOOLONG and a guilt-ridden lecher who loses successive mistresses to his wife 's beagle-eyed sleuthing . Dave can not stand the pompous Philistinism of Frank and his circle , gravitates toward Parkman 's lower depths , a kind of Mermaid Tavern setting where the young toughs drink , brawl and frolic with the " pigs " who work at the brassiere factory . The arbiter of this elegant bunch is ' Bama Dillert , a gambler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autocrat of the poker table , and Dave Hirsh shortly becomes his equally cool partner . ' Bama believes that luck is a function of the brain and that man will eventually master it ( " maybe thats the next stage of life or evolution us human beins will evolve up to or something like that " " ) . <P> The next stage of life for Dave is his strange platonic affair with Gwen French . Gwen is teacher of " creative writing " at Parkman College , where " the sharp vinegary smell of intellectual ferment was everywhere ... and the sizzling sound of the frying brains . " Naturally , Dave falls into her skillet . He dreams of " a long , rich , exchangeful , reaching out , and perhaps even sometimes touching , making contact , love affair . " But Gwen French believes that unrequited love drives a man to ink . Dave 's novel progresses to a tattoo of discipline and advice ( " Do n't complexify it " ) .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
