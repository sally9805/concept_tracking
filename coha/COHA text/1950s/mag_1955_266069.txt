Segregation of Negro interstate railroad and bus passengers must be ended , effective Jan. 10 , the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled last week . <P> From that day forth , Negroes who pay for the same interstate accommodation as whites must get the same accommodation as whites ; they must also be permitted to use the same railroad waiting rooms and washrooms as whites . Said the ICC : " The disadvantage to a traveler who is assigned accommodations or facilities so designated as to imply his inherent inferiority solely because of his race must be regarded under present conditions as unreasonable . Also , he is entitled to be free of annoyances , some petty and some substantial , which almost inevitably accompany segregation , even though the rail carriers . . . sincerely try to provide both races with equally convenient and comfortable cars and waiting rooms . " <P> " Peace &; Order . " The ICC handed down its ruling in two specific decisions , upholding the complaint of various Negro passengers against 13 Southern railroads and a bus company . At issue in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but equal " facilities for the races . <P> Although many Southerners and Northerners assume that Jim Crow has been around forever , the " separate but equal " doctrine is relatively new . Before and during the Civil War , there was no legal segregation of passengers in the Southern slave states . The first Jim Crow transportation law was not written in the U.S. until 1875 ( in Tennessee ) . <P> " It is a great deal pleasanter to travel with respectable and well-behaved colored people , " said the Charleston , S.C . News and Courier in 1885 , " than with unmannerly and ruffianly white men . " The doctrine of separate but equal spread outward from the western states of the South , however , until it gained the approval of the Supreme Court , in Plessy v. Ferguson , in 1896 . <P> In its lengthy finding last week , the ICC outlined how its decisions had consistently reflected the thinking of the Supreme Court and the trend of the country . The ICC had noted soon after its inception in 1887 that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children are educated in separate schools . Congress votes public moneys to separate charities . . . Trades unions . . . maintain and march in separate organizations . " Accordingly , the ICC defined its 1887 segregation policy for railroads to " aim at a result most likely to conduce to peace and order and to preserve the self-respect and dignity of citizenship of a common country . " Coming up to 1955 , the ICC last week quoted the recent rulings of the Supreme Court against segregation on interstate railroad sleeping and dining cars , in the public schools , parks and playgrounds . <P> " Self-Respect &; Dignity . " " It is hardly open to question that much progress in improved race relations has been made , " said the ICC , " and that more can be expected . . . We are therefore now free to place greater emphasis on steps ' to preserve the self-respect and dignity of citizenship of a common country , ' which this commission in 1887 balanced against ' peace and order .
