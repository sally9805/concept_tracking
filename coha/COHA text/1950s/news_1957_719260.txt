txt President Eisenhower has set a preliminary ceiling of $70 , - 000,000,000 on next year 's budget , it was reliably ' reported today . Achievement of such a spending figure would mean a reduction of $2,000,000,000 from the latest estimate for the current fiscal year . It would also greatly increase the chance of a tax cut . Assuming no economic slump , a budget showing a $70,000,000,000 spending figure could easily show a surplus of $5,000,000,000 or more , fully enough for a worthwhile tax cut . No Assurance Yet There is no assurance yet , informed officials stressed today , that ' the $70,000,000,000 ceiling will be achieved , but they were equally insistent that the figure was more than just a target with little hope of achievement . It is generally understood that within the $70,000,000,000 ceiling the Defense Department will be allowed to spend $38 , : . 000,000,000 foir military functions , the same as the spending ceiling impdsed this year . Thus reductions from current levels of spending would presumably have to be achieved outside of the military services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense spending , reduction , the $70,000,000,000 figure , or even lower , may well be achieved . However , one major reduction may be put in the budget only on the assumption of a change in the law by Congress ? a change in the law that Congress will be reluctant to make . probably Show Reactions This is in the field of ture . The budget . may base estimated spending for price-support programs on the assumption of a law permitting . the Secretary of Agriculture to set lower ? price support levels than present law permits . It will probably also show reductions in soil bank , agricultural conservation and-other farm programs . Whatever the mechanics , there seems almost certain to be a large reduction ? as much as $1,000,000,000 or even more ? in the $5,000,000,000 of farm spending now estimated for the current fiscal year . The President , it is understood , has become firmly convinced that such a level of spending is too high . On the basis of past and current events , there are likely to be significant reductions in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted by ' Congress this year could cut spending significantly next year . The Administration will certainly ask for a large new program , but spending will be based mainly on the program voted in the past . Export-Import Bank . Spending here was pushed up artificially in the current year by a decision of Britain to draw on a $500,000,000 credit arranged in February . There will be no such drawing in the next fiscal year . 4IStockpiling . Here again , spending this year was artificially inflated by some special factors that will probably not be present next year . School Aid May Be Omitted There is a possibility that the President Will decide not even to ask Congress next year for a school construction bill . This is not yet finally decided . If he does not , the budget will not have to include the first-year expenditures of about $200,000 , . 000 . Some heavy-spending programs , such as veterans benefits and aid to the states fox public assistance , seem likely to show small increases . There will certainly be small increases , also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , interest on the national debt almost certainly will not show the huge increase it has been showing for the last two years . It is quite probable that Interest rates have reached their peak , and total interest payments may well be estimated at or even below this year 's levels . Other small economies can be expected throughout the Government , some of them forced by Congressional appropriations cuts this year . Thus , while budget officials are as always reluctant to talk about next-. year 's prospects , there is evidence that they can approach the problem of meeting the $70,000,000,000 ceiling with considerable hope of success . The drive from the political forces within the Administration for such an achievement is strong . There is a wide-spread feeling in Republican party circles that this year 's record peacetime budget seriously damaged the President among the more conservative elements of the party  --  including many of the men who have been counted upon in the past for large contributions . Expenditures in the current fiscal year were estimated at $72,000,000,000 in an October review by the Budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitting this budget to Congress last January , President Eisenhower listed prospective expenditures of $71,800,000 , - 000 and forecast a surplus of $1,800,000,000.
