The U.S. , the world 's greatest technological civilization , is running short of engineers . For years it looked as if there would be a glut , not a shortage . Engineering students used to spend their last spring in college like any other seniors : looking for jobs . But today industry competes for their services with the fierce cunning of Hollywood star-snatchers ; they are wooed by eager personnel men , treated to lavish dinners , whisked off on inspection trips to factories . Most engineering graduates have at least half a dozen offers , with an average starting salary of $350 a month . <P> One large company recently offered to hire Yale 's entire crop of graduate electrical engineers-sight unseen . Another promised the University of Santa Clara to employ even those engineering students who flunk their finals . Men about to be drafted are being signed to promissory contracts for the future . " It 's like a fraternity rush , " said the University of California 's Associate Dean Everett Howe last week . " It 's bad for the boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> But there are just hot enough engineers to go around . Only 28,000 will graduate this June . Twice that number would not fill industry 's demand . <P> Prophets &; Experts . Enrollment in engineering schools is only slightly more than in 1940 , while industry 's demand has increased tremendously under the impetus of war production . Worried industrialists also blame 1 ) the low birth rate of the ' 30s , which has kept college classes limited ; 2 ) the armed forces , which snatch many engineering students before private industry gets them ( the greatest concentration of M.I.T. graduates in the world now works at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base ) ; 3 ) a wrong steer ( fostered by prophetic experts ) that engineering would soon be an overcrowded profession . <P> Westinghouse statisticians calculate that in 1900 only one engineer was needed for every 250 workers in industry , by 1930 it took one engineer for 100 , and soon one engineer will be needed for 50 . <P> Fads &; Favoritism . Industrialists admit that the shortage is partly their fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the jobs for which new engineers are hired could be filled by bachelors of arts . It has become a fad in U.S. industry to hire an engineer for almost any position . Today a man can study civil engineering , then get a sudden hankering for aeronautics , and any one of the major aircraft companies will hire him . If he tires of his slide rule and looks for work as a salesman , he will get preference because he is a trained engineer . <P> In one sense , the rush to hire engineers endangers the future supply . Seeing their former students get higher starting salaries in industry than they make after years of teaching , many instructors are quitting the campus . Few young men are filling the gaps in the teaching staffs . <P> Supply &; Demand . What can be done ? Educators and industrialists suggest some remedies : <P> Engineers should be more wisely and efficiently used in industry . <P> Women should be encouraged to go into certain types of engineering jobs . Last year , of some 40,000 engineering degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students with some technical schooling should be persuaded to continue at engineering schools rather than take high-paying jobs right away .
