txt President Truman has reconvened his coal inquiry board on the eve of another attempt by operators and miners to settle their long-standing dispute . The meeting at 11 A. M. tomorrow will be under the figurative eyes of the Federal District Court , which issued an order last Saturday requiring the union to send the 370,000 striking bituminous miners back to work . At the same time both David L. Cole , chairman of the President 's board , and Cyrus S. Ching , director of the Federal Mediation Service , will be on hand to offer the ' participants their services . Mr. Ching and Mr. Cole will also keep President Truman informed on the progress of the negotiations . ? Mr. Cole arrived in Washington tonight and said that he hoped the conference tomorrow would lead to a contract that would end the prolonged coal dispute . His own plans , he explained , were " flexible . " He indicated that they would depend largely on the developments here in the next day or two . Federal officials hoped for the best in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertainties might pose awkward questions at the start . First , the United Mine Workers expected that all coal operators groups would take part jointly in tomorrow 's court-directed session to " 4argain in good faith . " , But the Southern Coal Producers Association probably will insist on separate conferences with the union such as have been conducted since May 25 . Second and more serious , is an apparent mystery involving the // COAL BOARD CALLED BACK BY PRESIDENT // message the union said it sent to 3,000 locals yesterday directing the miners to return to work . Tonight the National Coal Association received from the Union Pacific Coal Company , " captive " mine subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad , what purported to be a notice posted at Rock Springs , Wyo. , signed by Huston Martin , president of the United Mine Workers ' District 22 . The notice , ' said to have been addressed to local unions , read as follows : " Tuesday , Feb. 14 , " Local Union No. ? attention Secretary . " I have this date received a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to work . The International has not requested stoppage of work but to conform to the laws of the country , I am asking each member of the United Mine Workers of America to use his own prerogative as an American citizen whether to work or not and it is entirely in your hands . " Messages to Locals Mailed If this notice is an official statement it differs materially from the telegram the union reported Saturday had been sent by Mr. Lewis to his district officers , and from the court 's instructions . Mr. Lewis ' message , embodying the order of Federal Judge Richmond B. Keech , unequivocally said that the union " has no alternative other than to instruct you and all other agents of our union * * * tO take all appropriate action to insure that the instructions of the court are carried out and that all members of our union * * * cease said , strike and return to their employment forthwith . " When the language of the notice purporting to have been posted at Rock Springs was called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew nothing about it . However , he clarified a statement issued on behalf of ' the union earlier in the day to the effect that 3,000 telegrams had beeen sent out yesterday to locals ordering them to send the strikers back to work . This official explained that the 3,000 communications had been sent out yesterday , not as telegrams but as letters . As letters , some would take several days to reach their destinations . Previous Explanation Recalled The letters , he added , had included the language used by Mr. Lewis , union president , in his wire to the district officers last Saturday . The previous union explanation had been that messages had been sent out as telegrams and that they had not been sent out on Saturday because of the late hour of injunction service . The injunction was served on Mr. Lewis shortly before 1 P. M. and the union said that it was impossible to send out the 3,000 messages at that hour owing to lack of help in the headquarters office , which is usually closed on Saturday . Coal association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal that telegrams such as those described by union officials here had been received by local unions . While the President 's summoning of the fact-finding board at this time is entirely statutory it is somewhat unorthodox . The President 's duty under the TaftHartley Act is to recall the board after an injunction order is issued . Usually this has meant that the board would be called after the full sixty days restraint had been imposed . But this time the President called for the board after a temporary order returnable next Monday had been issued but before argument for continuing the order for the full sixty-day period had been heard . Will Watch Developments Mr. Ching , who announced President Truman 's action , said that he and Mr. Cole had , in view of the conferences tomorrow , " made arrangements to keep in close touch with developments in such collective bargaining meetings in order that we may be in a position to assist the parties and to keep the President currently informed . " The statement added : " Either singly or jointly we shall attend such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a contribution to the settlement of the dispute . At this time neither Mr. Cole nor I contemplate participation in tomorrow 's bargaining sessions : " At the most , it was said by a conciliation official , Mr. Cole might make a brief statement at the opening of the conference tomorrow and then leave . If the parties should request him to remain , he would do so . Informal coal rationing began in Washington today at the behest of the District of Columbia Commissioners . They directed coal dealers to restrict consumer- deliveries and to take steps at once to draw up a fuel conservation program . Coal dealers were requested to deliver no more than one ton of anthracite at a time to a consumer and to induce such coal users to take , if possible , smaller , and more available , hard coal sizes .
