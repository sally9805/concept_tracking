On Wall Street last week , a new set of market leaders took over . They were the stocks of companies with big uranium holdings . In the rush , one of the fastest gainers was Climax Molybdenum Co. , which has mines spread over three western states . Climax went up four points and finished out the week at a new high of 45 . <P> With a string of uranium mines and one mill already operating at capacity in Colorado 's plateau country , Climax announced that it was moving its uranium subsidiary headquarters from New York to Grand Junction , Colo. , to be closer to actual operations , making it easier to expand into uranium . Though the company netted only $428,248 ( 4.4% of total profits ) from uranium in fiscal 1953 , it is prospecting for more lodes , will build new ore-processing plants wherever needed . <P> Said Climax President Arthur H. Bunker : " Our plan is to be very active in uranium . The acquisition of property is continual . " <P> Risky Business . But Bunker , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not betting all his money on it . His company has set up a separate department of industrial development to invest in a whole new series of strategic metals . Climax owns thorium deposits in Colo rado , wants to expand into large-scale production of such other vital metals as nickel , cobalt and manganese , all needed for U.S. strategic stockpiles . <P> Climax also passed on some good news about its overall business to stockholders last week . The company 's biggest business is mining molybdenum , the heat-resistant metal ( melting point : 4,750 F. ) for hardening steel . In 1953 , Climax ' sales climbed to $38,907,151 , 30% better than 1952 , and earnings rose from $6,071,519 in 1952 to almost $9,717,000 last year . <P> Climax ' miners , who must tunnel through Colorado 's Bartlett Mountain for the ore , call it " molly bedamned , " and until World War I no one had much use for the metal . The Germans , then short of tungsten , first used it to harden the barrels of their Big Berthas . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In peacetime , however , most steelmakers preferred tungsten ; molybdenum production usually dropped off to a trickle . <P> Payoff . With the help of the jet age , hustling President Bunker has managed to turn moly into a bonanza . When Bunker , who is considered one of the top U.S. authorities on raw materials , took over Climax in 1949 , the company owned North America 's biggest known supply of the metal , in Colorado , but had few buyers . Bunker , 58 , went to Washington to argue that the U.S. was in poor shape for the heat-resistant alloy it needed for jet engines , persuaded the Government to start buying it . <P> Korea proved Bunker right . When the U.S. started rearming , demand for moly soared . By 1951 , production had doubled to 22 million lbs . a year and Climax was selling all it could mine . To catch up with demand , it has just completed a $35 million expansion at the moly mine in Colorado that will boost production another 55% , give Climax more than 70% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
