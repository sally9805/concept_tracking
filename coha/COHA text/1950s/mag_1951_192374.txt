Four and twenty fat women sat in a row . They hardly knew where they were-and did n't care . Eleven stories below , in Chicago 's Loop , riveters chattered , but all they heard was a soothing , syrupy voice . Said the voice : " Close your eyes and relax . " They did . " You are going to be deep , deep asleep in a few minutes . " They slept . <P> The molasses voice flowed on : " You will be unable to use sugar , starches , oils or fats in your foods ... Even the thought of them will be repulsive to you ... You will not drink carbonated drinks any more , nor beer , nor liquor ... You will end your bedtime snacks and your eating between meals . You will be satisfied with only half your usual quantity of food ... " <P> The chunky owner of the voice , Edwin L. Baron , " master hypnotist , " padded softly among the entranced women . When an eyelid fluttered , he put his hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now I will count to three and you will wake up , " he said briskly . With yawns and stretches , they woke . The lesson had lasted half an hour . <P> Baron 's reducing classes have nicely filled the summer slump in his hypnotism lectures . At first he took no fees , but last week , with 70 clients , he began to charge newcomers $2.50 a lesson . <P> Said Mrs. Miriam Shapiro , after losing 14 Ibs. in five weeks : " I feel like I 'm borrowing his will power . It 's all in your head . My desire to eat the wrong foods is gone . I do n't have to worry about diets . " Mrs. Beatrice Barnett dropped 16 Ibs. in two weeks , boasted : " I 've lost absolutely all taste for sweets and in-between snacks . It 's helped my bronchial asthma too , and I sleep nights . " <P> Psychiatrists are leery of group hypnosis : they say that a borderline mental case , thus hypnotized , may slip over the line into insanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological . It 's purely a research project . " <P> Dollie Dimples ( in private life , Mrs. Celesta Geyer of Orlando , Fla. ) was heavier ( 555 Ibs. ) last year , worked as a carnival fat lady . Then she had a heart attack and retired from show business . Last week , on her 50th birthday , five-foot Dollie was down to 154 . Said she : " It 's simple . All anyone has to do is diet properly . " She did it by cutting down to 800 calories a day ( normal U.S. diet : 3,000 calories ) .
