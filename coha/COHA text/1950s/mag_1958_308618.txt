The carved mahogany door of the House Ways &; Means Committee 's conference room swung open and out came a score of frazzled committee members , leaving wan and weary Chairman Wilbur Mills behind to talk to reporters . Arkansas ' Mills had an announcement of key importance : pending a final vote this week , the committee had informally approved the Eisenhower Administration 's five-year extension of the reciprocal-trade program , with authority for the President to cut tariffs by an additional 25% at the top rate of 5% a year . <P> Behind that announcement lay weeks of wrangling and hours of bone-tiring , closed-door committee sessions under Wilbur Mills , longtime reciprocal-trade advocate , whose hopes to be Sam Rayburn 's successor as Democratic House Speaker might well be at stake in the success or failure of the trade bill . At one point Mills was so discouraged that he predicted total House defeat for reciprocal trade , urged the Administration to take responsibility for watering down its own program ( TIME , May 19 ) . When the Administration stood firm , Mills went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ways &; Means Committee 's informal approval was a thing of doubtful value and doubtful parentage , known as the " Martin Amendment " because House Republican Leader Joe Martin had helped persuade President Eisenhower to approve it . <P> Privileged Business . Under the amendment , adopted by a 16-to-9 Ways &; Means Committee vote , if the President were to override any recommendation of the Tariff Commission , Congress would have 60 days to reverse his decision by a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate . Actually , Congress already has that power : it can pass laws reversing presidential tariff-cutting decisions , then override a presidential veto by a two-thirds vote . The only real difference is that under the Martin amendment a resolution reversing the President would become privileged business ; i.e. , it could come directly to the floors of Congress without being delayed or sidetracked in committees . <P> With the Martin amendment Wilbur Mills was willing to take a chance on reporting out the bill . But reciprocal trade is still a long way from being out of the woods . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closed rule -a rule that would bar amendments from the floor . To get that rule , Wilbur Mills is willing to retreat from the five-year reciprocal-trade extension to a three-year extension . <P> Combined Opposition . After that the program faces the opposition of protectionists who have , for the first time in years , combined in support of a single rival bill . Authored by Pennsylvania 's Republican Richard Simpson , it is openly designed to gut reciprocal trade . The key battle will come on a motion to send the reciprocal-trade bill back to the Ways &; Means Committee , with orders that it approve the Simpson substitute . <P> At week 's end , as the reciprocal-trade program moved toward the House floor , leaders of both parties were industriously counting House noses - and the future of liberalized foreign trade as a vital U.S. answer to Communist economic aggression hung in the balance .
