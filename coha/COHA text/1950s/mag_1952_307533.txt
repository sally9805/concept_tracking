As boss and chief stockholder of Schenley Industries , Inc. , Lewis Solon Rosenstiel built a $438 million empire and a reputation in the liquor trade as a confident hustler . During Prohibition , while distillers were folding up , Rosenstiel , then a whisky broker , bet his money on Repeal ; he bought up all the whisky he could lay his hands on . Result : the year after Repeal , his new Schenley company had sales of $40 million . <P> During World War II , when grain spirits were short , Rosenstiel confidently started using potato spirits in Three Feathers , one of his most popular blends . Result : Three Feathers was a top-selling U.S. whisky all through the wartime shortage-largely because it was the most available . Rosenstiel put on his greatest show of confidence by expanding . During and after the war , he bought the Blatz Brewing Co. , put Schenley into wines and vermouth ( Cresta Blanca , Roma and La Bohme ) , rum ( Carioca ) , cordials ( DuBouchett ) , brandies ( Coronet , J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Schenley , Gibson , etc. ) , and even set up a chemical division to make penicillin and other antibiotics . <P> Cause for Concern . Recently , Hustler Rosenstiel has tripped a few times . When other brands came back on the market in volume , Three Feathers sales slumped about 90% ; last year the brand did not even place in the top 25 . When grape prices skidded five years ago , Rosenstiel dropped close " to $14 million by buying at the wrong time . And when penicillin prices cracked recently , he took another beating . Rosenstiel miscalculated on another score : figuring that the public would turn back to straight whiskies after the war , he plugged his straights ( I. W. Harper , Ancient Age , Old Charter ) more than did other distillers . But the public preferred blends . Straights now account for only 30% of the whisky sold today , v. 60% prewar . Rosenstiel also spread his advertising funds over so many products that his top blends ( Schenley Reserve , Melrose Rare ) were not plugged as hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to show last year . While competitors ( Seagrams , National Distillers ) were setting records , Schenley 's sales were at the lowest level ( $450 million ) since 1944 . And this year , though all distillers are in a slump , Schenley is in a much deeper one . Recently its sales have been off 55% v. a drop of only 28% to 36% for Seagrams , Hiram Walker and National Distillers . Schenley 's troubles and its vast expansion have caused the company to borrow $150 million , although its assets are greater than any other U.S. liquor company . <P> New Platoon . Last week it looked as if rven Lew Rosenstiel thought it time for a pick-me-up . At 61 , he stepped out as president of Schenley ( but stayed as chairman ) , and elevated a whole platoon of young Schenley reserves . Into the presidency went Ralph Taft Heymsfeld , 44 , a Columbia-trained lawyer who joined the company 18 years ago and has specialized , as secretary and counsel , in fighting for fair trade and against high liquor taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 42 , who started with Schenley during Prohibition. *
