ARMED FORCES <P> Ever since dusk the ground-crew men had been tending the long , silvery B-29 like acolytes , running their flashlights along her vulnerable joints , pumping her broad wings full of 8,000 gallons of high-test gasoline , gently hoisting a dozen 500-lb. demolition bombs into her wide bays . By 11 o'clock pilots , navigators , radarmen , engineers and gunners tumbled aboard for a 2,400-mile training flight . With them went Brigadier General Robert F. Travis , the handsome , battle-tested commander of the air base and " old man " of the Ninth Bombardment Wing , to keep a sharp eye out for mistakes . <P> Heavy with her warlike load , the huge plane ate up most of the mile-and-a-half Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base runway before she was airborne . Seconds later , Plane Captain E. Q. Steffes radioed that he was in real triple trouble : two of his engines were roaring faster &; faster out of control , would probably soon tear themselves from the wings . And he was fighting the drag of a landing gear that would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skimmed close to the lights of Fairfield-Suisun 's sprawling trailer camp , and crash-landed-left wing first-into an open field , a mile short of the runway . <P> Bombs Away . In the first , long moment of silence , wisps of smoke began to curl out of the mangled metal . Then , as ambulances and fire trucks roared down from their ready stations , one of the crew jumped out of the wreckage and circled dazedly until a sergeant ran from the trailer camp to lead him away . Miraculously seven others , including Captain Steffes and his copilot , managed to drag themselves free . " Let 's get out of here , " one of them mumbled . " There are bombs on there . " <P> First the gasoline erupted into a tall , twisting pillar of bright flame . In its glare , the 200 families in the trailers , little more than a B-29 's length away , stumbled out of their homes and back into the darkness . Then , while seven fire trucks pumped Foamite into the flames , the bombs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bungalow . Bodies were blown back across the field , the fire trucks rolled up like the tops of sardine cans , the trailers and their little picket fences were smashed , as one witness put it , " like a giant had stepped on them . " <P> The neighboring towns of Vacaville and Vallejo heard the explosions , dispatched hearses , doctors , ambulances and more fire trucks to the base . These threaded their way through the refugees who swarmed dazedly out of the post gates and clogged the highways . <P> Lucky Warning . By dawn , the acting base commander could add up his night 's grim work . Of the plane 's crew of 20 , twelve were dead or missing , including General Travis . Seven other blasted bodies were believed to be those of the base fire men . Sixty men &; women of the trailer camp had been treated for injuries . Had there been no warning before the bomb explosions , the fatalities would have been catastrophic , for the mangled corner of the Fairfield-Suisun air base looked exactly as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
