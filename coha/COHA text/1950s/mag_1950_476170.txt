continued to be a nightmare for more than a month after my husband re-turned from Afghanistan . For more than a month I wakened every morning to a bad dream and went to bed at night to toss and turn sleeplessly . A few months ago I would not have believed that an American wife could have the experiences I was having . I felt as if I were in Moscow , or on the moon , not in the United States of America . America had become a land of fear instead of freedom , and the paradise in which I had been living had come to seem a fool 's paradise because I had been so foolishly unaware of the black roots of this thing which had been spreading under our American feet . I knew it had grown up to destroy freedom in other countries , and I had of course seen little dark frightening shoots of it nearer by , but never dreamed it would spring up to tangle round my feet . We had been a naturally rather happy-go-lucky American family , whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being responsible citizens . We had traveled a good deal but liked America best . Since the end of the war we had lived happily and quietly in a university community and it was terrifying to be catapulted into the glare of publicity which awaited my husband when he stepped off the plane at Idlewild on April 1 , 1950 . Since Senator McCarthy had made his first cowardly attack on him eighteen days before , and particularly during the week since he had made the fantastic charge that he was the " top Russian espionage agent in this country , " 1 had managed to keep away from the press . Now suddenly we had become as public as Ing , rid Bergman and her baby . By afternoon Owen was in all the headlines and our pictures were everywhere . Before we could go home there was to be a press conference in a New York hotel , and we hated having to duck from the taxi into the hotel elevator for fear of staring strangers . The elevator was filled with newsreel equipment being taken up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back and was disconcerted to have to sit next to Owen at a little table , facing the crowd and all the newsreel cameras . Owen is usually very much at home with newspapermen , but it made my heart ache to feel how tense and tired he was from his long journey and the shock of the attack . He could n't of course take time then to answer McCarthy 's lies . That would have to wait for the Senate hearing which he had asked for . He could only repeat that all of McCarthy 's charges were based on two complete false assumptions : that he had ever been connected with the State Department and that he was or ever had been a Communist . As I sat there beside him and heard him say , " I have never advocated or supported the cause of communism either within the United Statcs , in China , in the Far East , or anywhere in the world , " it all seemed to me so fantastically unnecessary . He had always written everything he thought , and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one who knew him and his writings could possibly believe he was a Communist . I thought then , as I was to think many times later , what a scandalously wicked waste of everyone 's time and money this whole thing was being ? since my husband 's real record was so easy to read . It just did n't make any sense that he had to be subjected to this " trial by headline " simply because of sensational charges by an irresponsible and publicity-seeking Senator . It seemed to inc then , and still seems to me , that the sensational news was not that McCarthy had called Lattimore a Russian agent , but that a United States Senator could stoop so low as to make fantastically unfounded charges against a private American citizen without the Senate and his own party rising up to repudiate him . At last we could go home . Owen slept on the train and I struggled to make an outline of the chaotic mass of lies in McCarthy 's speech so that Owen could prepare his replies with a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hardly stomach it . Even one lie makes me indignant , and this enormom mass of lies , many of them stupid and trivial but some colossal , filled me with such anger and indignation as I had not thought possible . We later counted ninety-six misstatements of fact in this one speech , and the task of answering them seemed Herculean . Our son David met us at the station . When we reached our once peaceful house in the country , wanting only to fall into bed , and saw two cars in the driveway with camera equipment protruding from their windows , we thought we could n't face another photographer or another question . We stopped to see our next door neighbors and stole home through the woods to our back door , Later David went out and explained something to the newspapermen . We did n't ask him what he said . IT T ut next day we packed up and moved to Washington , to be near the lawyers , and Owen 's files which had been moved there to facilitate the work of preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything would he cleared up and we would be home again in a few days . As it turned out we were in Washington most of the time for a full month , the most expensive month of our lives , financially , physically , and spiritually . During this month Owen carried on a fight not only for his good name but for the things he had always stood for ; his right in general to maintain his integrity as a scholar and to form and express his opinions honestly , in his country 's service , without fear of persecution or vilification ; and his right in particular as a student of Far Eastern problems to express an opinion on China which differed from the opinions of the China Lobby without being called disloyal or a Communist . He could not carry on this fight simply by calling McCarthy and his witnesses liars , or by making ringing declarations about democracy and the Bill of Rights . He had first to answer the charges point by point and with careful and painstaking documentation , and this not only took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was humiliating in the extreme , since scores of innocent acts and casual relationships out of many years of his past had been twisted to use against him , and many others viciously invented . But beyond this he managed somehow to lift the whole fight out of the sewer where McCarthy had placed it and turn it into a fight for freedom in which , before the month was over , he himself had become only a symbol , and the issue of freedom of opinion and expression was what stood out . This was made evident by the hundreds of letters which poured in from professors and students and writers repeating the refrain , " You are fighting our fight . " He could not have won the battle , even in a month , without the help of loyal friends . Especially , he could n't have won it without Abe Fortas , his lawyer . But it was chiefly Owen 's own clear record , his courage , his sure conviction , and his understanding of the basic issues which enabled him to succeed . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never so proud as I was during that month of his " ordeal by slander . " Owen has written a very human book about this battle and what he believes to be its causes and its meaning in American life , and it would be pointless for me to repeat what he has written . I would rather try to describe a little of what it was like for me , and will be like for many other women if McCarthyism is allowed to grow up in our land . M Y FfRST problem in Washington was to find a place for us to live . Within a few days we had had several houses offered to us , but the only thing we could do at first , since we dreaded the publicity of a hotel , was to ask Owen 's parents to move over to our house in Ruxton so that we could use their small apartment . McCarthy 's attack had already caused inconvenience and expense to a number of our friends , and its effects on these two old people were not the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a hospital to have a cataract removed , but she was so worried over our troubles that the operation had to he postponed for more than a month , and Father 's health also suffered greatly from the strain . We hated to move them but did n't know what else to do for a couple of days , until we were loaned the house of some friends who were away . Then we had a team to feed . Owen 's good friends Joe Barnes and Stanley Salmen had both come to help him prepare his statement and we were all working under such pressure that there was no time to go out for meals . Fortunately nineteen-year-old David and his red-headed friend Emily Lewis undertook to shop and cook and wash dishes and make beds , and what they lacked in skill they made up for in ingenuity and devotion ? with the aid of a nearby delicatessen . One of my humble jobs was to look after the files and be able to produce information and documentation just when it was needed . This was a three-ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , some were still at Owen 's office in Baltimore , and some at home in Ruxton , and the writing team was working at the house in Washington . So it meant looking ahead as much as possible to know what might be needed and entailedmuch telephoning to Baltimore and shuttling back and forth in Washington . At the hearings I sat behind Owen with a little black file box and managed pretty well to pass documents up to Abe when they were needed . But our first day in Washington I slipped up badly . I was at the apartment working with Owen , when the telephone rang . Abe wanted immediately a copy of a memorandum Owen had written in connection with a conference he had attended at the State Department . McCarthy had accused the State Department of suppressing this document ? which , he said , would prove his charge that Owen was the " architect " of the Department 's Far Eastern policy . McCarthy demanded that the Department make the memorandum public , and threatened to " expose " it himself if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devious and underhand maneuver . McCarthy knew that the document was one of a number which the Department had asked non-official Far Eastern experts to submit , and that the Department had assured these people that their memoranda would be regarded as confidential , this being their usual policy in order to encourage precisely the kind of free and uninhibited expression of opinion that McCarthyism seeks to kill . We knew that the State Department would not break its rule and release the memorandum , even though the release would be beneficial to it and to Owen . We therefore decided to release it ourselves , immediately , so as to deflate McCarthy 's balloon . " Immediately " meant so quickly that the next editions of the newspapers following McCarthy 's statement would contain the story of our release and the text of the memorandum . Abe was therefore quite ready to skin me when I could n't find it . Fortunately for my skin a copy was found at the last possible minute and rushed to the mimeogaphers . As a matter of fact there was n't any mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it in a magazine article several months before which anyone could buy for fifty cents ! 0 N THE morning of the hearing I suddenly realized with horror how conspicuous we were going to be and that I had been much too busy to think about clothes . David had come down from Harvard with one suit , and he had had to buy another the day before because a zipper had jammed . And I hastily borrowed a hat that morning because my own was looking so bedraggled . But I was n't surprised to read in a paper the next day about the " little doctor with the shiny-seated pants " and his " handsome but rougele.ss wife . " A lot of our friends watched us all day on television ; and one man , who wrote Owen that he had been the butler at a house where we had dined twenty years ago and had followed Owen 's career ever since , said he saw me take a little nap toward the end of the morning . I may have closed my eyes , because sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I never felt less like sleeping . I was bursting with pride in my husband . The unwonted applause at the end of his statement was not only by his friends ? for we had made no effort to invite friends to the hearing ? but was a really spontaneous outburst by almost every-one in the room . This was the first time I had ever attended a Senate hearing , and even if I had not been emotionally involved I would have been moved by the drama and the dignity of it ? until the middle of the afternoon when Senator Hickenlooper began his questioning . Then the drama became cheap melodrama and the dignified questioning by the other Senators was replaced by a soap opera version of how to catch a spy . The day ended with the dramatic announcement by Senator Tydings that four out of five members of the committee had examined a lengthy summary of the FBI file on Owen and that " it was the universal opinion of all the members of the Committee present and all others in the room , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that file to show that you were a Communist or had ever been a Communist or that you were ever in any way connected with any espionage information or charges . So that the FBI puts you completely , up to this moment at least , in the clear . " This announcement seemed to me then to be a most natural culmination to Owen 's day of triumph . I had enough respect for the FBI to know they could have nothing in their files which would in any way bear out McCarthy 's charges , and I had enough respect for Senator Tydings to assume that he would say so . Even though by that time I considered myself a disillusioned woman compared with my innocence of a few weeks before , I was amazed to hear the next day that a lot of people thought Tydings had " stuck his neck out " by saying what was obviously true . I was to learn only later how strong the political pressures were on some members of the committee which might make it difficult for them to put simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at the time about Senator Tyding 's announcement was that Owen 's file was " quite lengthy . " Since he had never belonged to an organization labeled " subversive " by the Attorney General and had known very few individuals now considered subversive I could n't imagine what could make it long . I did not know then to what lengths fanatics in the China Lobby must have gone to see that all sorts of " allegations " ? many of them completely fictitious ? reached those files , and therefore how fortunate it was that the FBI must have obtained information from other sources which counteracted them . Since most of these allegations had been aired by McCarthy it was good that Owen had this public chance to clear them up . I do not know if denials are attached to allegations in the FBI files or if there is any way of " clearing " one 's FBI record , but at least he had an opportunity to clear his name before the public , as much as it ever can be cleared of such a smear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name in the press will always be followed by " the man whom Senator McCarthy accused of being the top Russian agent in this country , " whereas McCarthy will not be dubbed " the man who falsely accused Owen Lattimore of being a Communist , " or " the man who defended the Matmedy murderers , " but merely " Joseph McCarthy , Republican , of Wisconsin . " At any rate , by the end of the day we were so happy that the ordeal was over that we felt gay and carefree . When we got home I put on my best dress ( it happened to be red ) , and we all went out to celebrate . David had felt as proud of Owen as I did , and , as he told us later , " full of filial piety . " He thought , as we all did , that our fight was over . He went back to college that weekend , and when WHAT IT WAS he took the zipperless trousers to the " Gold Coast Valeteria " to be mended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCarthy dropped dead already , " he thought the comment was apt . THE day after the hearing we moved back to Maryland . McCarthy had boasted , however , that he would produce witnesses to prove his allegation that Owen had been a Communist ( he seemed to wish he could forget his No . I spy charge ) . We heard over the weekend that he was traveling around trying to line some up but we did n't really think he would succeed . We knew , of course , that he could always get Freda Utley , and we rather hoped he would , since she would hardly impress anyone favorably . But we had heard that McCarthy had decided , too , that Freda would n't help his cause , and that he did not want her called . A few days after the hearing , however , there was a report on the radio that Louis Budenz , the **25;560;TOOLONG who had become an ardent and assiduous professional informer , had been subpoenaed to appear the following week . Owen had never met Budenz and knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ; but the day we had to spend in the Senate Caucus Room listening to him describe his sordid life in the Communist underworld in which he spent ten years was a gruesome experience . He built up a picture of a sinister murky world of Communist conspiracy which for all I know may exist . lie then plucked Owen from a normal open bright American world and attempted to connect him with his own dark past . Nothing he said about Owen had any relation at all to reality , Budenz did n't even try to base it on anything more than flimsy hearsay , but the psychological effect on his listeners seemed to me terrifying . If Abe had been allowed to question him , or if the committee had used more than a fraction of the material Abe had supplied them with , Owen could have been taken out of that picture much faster than he was put into it . But that did n't happen , and when the afternoon session was finally over we felt as if we had spent an entire day in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at which Freda Utley finally did testify , but it had moments of comic relief which made it easier to bear . Here was someone I had known . We had felt very sorry for her when her husband was a victim of a Soviet purge and had done a good deal to help her . I knew she had turned against Owen ? as she had against many others who had befriended her ? and I knew of her connections with the China Lobby , but I had not seen her for years and was not entirely prepared for the spectacle she made of herself . A great part of her " evidence " consisted in quoting out of context things that Owen had written and then giving her fanciful interpretation of their meaning . I do not know why lawyers tell their clients to " keep a poker face . " Abe asked me to , and I tried , but during this session I found my mouth dropping open again and again at her fantastic distortions , and Abe 's eyes in the back of his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapermen were muttering too , and the committee became restless and annoyed . And when during the questioning she admitted that she had advocated a negotiated peace with Hitler Germany during the war , written a pro-Axis article for Reader 's Digest a month before Pearl Harbor , and attacked American policy in postwar Germany as pro-Communist , nobody paid much more attention to what she said about Owen Lattimore . IN CONTRAST to Budenz and Utley the wit- nesses called by Owen were straightfor- ward people who attempted no ideologi-cal double-talk . Bella Dodd was called because she had been a higher-up Communist than Budenz but had never heard of Owen Lattimore . She had been expelled from the Party because she tried to be honest , and while Hickenlooper tried to show that she was still a radical everyone could see that in answering questions she was trying to be honest with herself instead of just agreeing with her questioners . General Thorpe was called because as chief of MacArthur 's counter-intelligence he had investigated Owen three times and knew he was a loyal American . Demaree Bess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utley testified because Owen had been his house guest on his only visit to Moscow , in 1936 , and he knew just what Owen was doing there . Both of these men are solid conservatives of the finest kind , and though Thorpe was heckled and Bess allowed only to read the letter he had previously written to Senator Tydings , they were obviously so real and genuine and American that we felt on familiar ground again . a wondering drag on . Owen and Abe had worked very hard on a statement for this hearing and Joe Barnes had come down again from New York to help them . It not only answered all the new charges which had been made but , like the first one , dealt with the broader issues of foreign policy and freedom of expression . When Owen read the sentence , " My obligation is to do everything that I can , by the emphatic and conclusive refutation of these charges , to establish , beyond question , beyond dispute , and beyond further challenge , the right of American scholars and authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the paralyzing fear of the kind of attack to which I have been subjected , " there was a loud burst of applause . The whole thing was dragged down again by a day and a half of dreary questioning , most of it by Hickenlooper and most of it about people , organizations , and events with which Owen had no connection . We are still curious as to whether he could have heard allegations that Owen was connected with them or was shooting entirely in the dark I liked to sit behind Owen and Abe at the hearings . They almost never spoke to each other ? no consultations , no whispers , no note passing . Even during Hickenlooper 's tricky questioning Abe seemed relaxed , as if he had complete confidence that Owen could handle the questions without falling into traps . But his being there gave Owen confidence and strength . Owen 's answers were always very sure , but in the midst of one of his unsuccessful fishingexpeditions Hickenlooper asked a question which involved me , and I fell down on it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a lecture at the Tom Mooney Labor School ? " Owen turned to me . The name was totally unfamiliar and / immediately said I did n't remember it . But if I had taken enough time to think I would have remembered that among the scores of schools , churches , and clubs I had spoken to about China in that war year there was a labor night school . If it was called the Tom Mooney School then I did n't know it . And if it turned out to be a Communist school , which I certainly did n't know , it probably did them good to hear something in support of Chiang Kai-shek and China 's gallant resistance which was the opposite of the " Communist line . " It did n't seem important one way or the other , but after the noon recess Hickenlooper triumphantly produced an old newspaper with an announcement of my lecture , and I felt very foolish not to have remembered it . Except for this ' ' guilt by matrimony , " as Owen called it , Hickenlooper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the end of the second afternoon the hearing just petered out . Tydings had gone to a meeting . Nothing was wound up or finished . We just went home , feeling that complete vindication was something the most innocent man could never achieve by this haphazard procedure . TV 0 N THE third of May we came home to Baltimore , not to relax , although we were bone tired , but to try to forget McCarthy and his accomplices while we tackled the mass of work which had collected on our desks during the weeks when everything but the hearings had been neglected . But we were not allowed to forget McCarthy as day after day , from friends and in letters , one story after another began to unfold of the effects which the attack on Owen had had on the lives of other people , friends and relatives and students and colleagues , and on the life of our university community . Its full effects upon our own lives also became manifest only gradually . I think the first thing we became aware of when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly been only casual acquaintances who had become real friends , and the number of new friends we had acquired . This was heart-warming , because we knew that there must be others who had become suspicious of us , or afraid , and that we would discover these only gradually . The occasion when Owen came nearest to feeling that his bitter fight had been worth all that it cost was a dinner and reception given by the Johns Hopkins faculty . The hall was packed with his colleagues who had come to testify to their confidence in him and to let him know that they appreciated his part in a struggle which they knew was theirs . We were eager to see all of our friends , and they wanted to hear about our experiences and to know what they could do to help to curb this McCarthyism of which they had suddenly become aware . We were also eager to answer the hundreds of letters which had poured in since March 13 . Many of our Baltimore friends , and many people who had written us , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their concern and to offer us generous help . Nothing is more dampening than an ignored offer of help and friendship and we needed both , but we were in a real dilemma . We were physically exhausted . Neglected work had piled mountain high . And Owen 's publisher wanted him to complete a book about his Washington experience before the end of the month . This meant that both of us must continue to neglect almost everything else and work night and day for another three weeks , but it seemed more important and urgent than anything else we could do . Most of our friends were wonderfully understanding and patient , but we did find ourselves running the risk of losing some of the friends we had been so happy to gain , and one in particular turned violently against us because she felt that help she had been at some pains to offer had been unappreciated . Because our friends and neighbors had all been so kind it was a shock to read in the paper one day that according to a Gallup poll hall the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed incredible that so many Americans either approved of the kind of thing McCarthy had done to us , or did n't care ? that they must believe like the Communists that the end justified the means , or at the very least that " where there is smoke there is fire . " To say this about fire is so easy , and so false . A most apt comment on it was made by a Navy man who served on the stern end of a destroyer during the war , laying smoke screens . He said that whenever he saw vast and unnatural quantities of smoke his first thought was that there must be a smoke machine at work . Where were all these people described by Mr. Gallup ? We kept hearing about them but we did n't meet them , and unlike Haldore Hanson and Mrs. Brunauer we did n't receive threatening letters from our neighbors . But for weeks we kept expecting to , and whenever I gave my name to a dry cleaner or a grocer or a stranger anywhere I wondered which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Negro friend once described to me how it felt never to know where she would meet prejudice and rebuffs , and now I think I know how she feels . A MONG the thousand or so friendly letters we have had there have been a few unpleasant ones , of course , but surprisingly few . One thing 1 try to keep from doing is wondering about the very few old friends who have n't written us at all , but the suspicions which McCarthyism breeds make it difficult sometimes to be sensible . There have been a few bitter disillusionments . The man who could have helped Owen more than anyone else , and would have increased his own stature by doing so , did nothing . Others , who were in government jobs and therefore vulnerable , were afraid . We had letters from only three people in govern ? ent jobs , and they , I 'm proud to say , were all women . We also had letters from several wives of government officials . One State Department wife wrote , " He is really carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not know if her husband saw the letter . Out of these experiences , a few , a very few , real enemies emerged whom we never dreamed we had , people who out of jealousy or imagined slights had been nursing grudges and seized this opportunity for revenge . The mast surprising of these revealed himself as a result of one of the completely innocent incidents of our lives , which turned into a boomerang . Since we live in the country , on weekends our house is always full of guests . One weekend in June of 1945 we had invited Jack Service , an old friend who had just returned from China , to come over from Washington , and also Andrew Roth , a young naval officer who had told Owen when we met him in Washington that he would like to consult him about a book about Japan which he had just finished . We had also invited two young Hopkins faculty members for lunch on Sunday as we thought they would be interested in meeting Jack . One of them brought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we had a picnic lunch in the woods , after which Owen and Jack spent some time looking at the galley proofs of Roth 's book . Four days later not only we but of course our other guests were shocked to read that both Service and Roth had been arrested in connection with the " Amerasia case . " Service was never indicted and Roth 's indictment was soon dropped . It was of course a pure coincidence that they were both at our house that day . Neither of them had ever been there before . But of course this coincidence was enough to make the picnic interesting to McCarthy . In McCarthy 's Senate speech he claimed to have secured an affidavit and a statement from two of our guests which gave really lurid accounts of our innocent picnic , with secret documents , surreptitiously exchanged brief cases , and other soap opera details . Knowing McCarthy 's genius for invention we asked both men if they would send statements over to us in Washington . To our great surprise one of them not only ignored our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not deny having signed the affidavit McCarthy described , although as far as I know he has never attempted to explain why he thought we had invited him to witness our nefarious deeds . When he gave his evidence that Owen must be a Communist , he did not say that he had ever read one of his books or had had a political discussion with him ; what he produced was a long accumulated file of the Gitina lobbyist Kohlberg 's allegations . The efforts of McCarthyites to sow suspicion and dissension in our university community fortunately misfired in the case of Malcolm Moos , our other picnic guest . A rumor had reached us. undoubtedly planted For the purpose of making trouble between us and our friends , that he too was ready to testify that Owen was a Communist . .1 his MAGAZINE would have seemed fantastic and gone immediately into the wastebasket , even without a later message which contradicted it , if it had not been for the incredible news we had just had about the other man , whom Owen had equally trusted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our request for his recollections of the picnic , which corresponded entirely to ours , and generously offered to testify before the committee . He later told us about a visit he had received from three of McCarthy 's men which throws some light on the methods which they used in their efforts to secure information . On March 26 , after eleven at night , three men came up to the Moos 's apartment , having told the receptionist downstairs that they were expected . Mr. and Mrs. Moos were just going to bed when they knocked , in the kind of bed that lets down from the wall in the living room of their small apartment . When Mrs. Moos went to the door in her dressing gown the men told her that it was urgent for them to see her husband and that they were " from Oberlin . " Since her husband did n't go to Oberlin she thought this a little strange , but she asked them to wait a minute and rushed back to push the bed back into the wall and warn her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman Kirsten from Wisconsin and two ex-FBI men . ( Kirsten is an ex-Congressman employed by McCarthy . ) They said they had just come from five hours with our other picnic guest and that he had given them a signed statement . Mr. and Mrs. Moos told them they had seen nothing strange about the picnic and had seen no documents except the galley proofs of Roth 's book . The men took no notes and did not ask them to sign anything . and after about fifteen minutes they left . But what they reported to McCarthy was made into a very different story . TRE costs to us of the McCarthy attack have been unbelievable . It has taken two months out of our lives and left us so exhausted that it will take another two months to recover . During this time Owen 's regular work has had to be done largely by others and he has had to cancel lectures and writing commitments . We have had to employ extra help of all kinds , and keep two households going while lye were living in Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtime rates , cost more than $1,100 , travel and telephone another thousand , and the cost of the transcripts of the hearings more than $300 . All of this is much more than a college professor can afford ? but the expense we expected would shipwreck us completely turned out to be nothing at all . On that desperate day when Owen was in Afghanistan and I heard of McCarthy 's attack I had gone to the best law firm I knew , feeling that whatever it might cost we could sell our house and Dave and I could go to work and we could raise the money somehow . Many people in the firm worked unstintingly on the unpleasant job , not only skillfully but sympathetically and cheerfully , and to our ? amazement they refused to charge a fee . I can not think of a finer public service than to wage their kind of a fight for freedom at this crucial time . I do not think I have become embittered by this experience . I have been terribly angry and frightened that it could happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been terribly indignant that we have had to pay so high a price . But I have also become aware of a danger to our American life which I did not know about , and so inspired by the number of good and fine people who are not afraid to make real sacrifices to fight that danger , that I have been given a new purpose and new courage .
