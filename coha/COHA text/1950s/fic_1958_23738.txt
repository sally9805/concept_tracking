THE IOWAN 'S CURSE A Story by Charles G. Finney Drawings by Reese Brandt A FTER the defense plant shut down , people left Manacle , Arizona , in droves . They had to . It was a one-industry town ; with that one industry gone , you could n't even make a living taking in your neighbor 's washing because , chances were , you did n't even have a neighbor any longer . That was why we settled there . We had our own money and wanted to live in a place where it was quiet . Manacle was very quiet . The climate there was just what the doctor had ordered for both of us . We bought a nice little place several miles from the town proper . It consisted of a small and very comfortable house and ten fenced acres of unimproved desert land . Slightly off center in the ten-acre plot was an outcropping of rock that reared about thirty feet in the air and could be easily climbed . This was known locally as " The  --  Cathedral . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our little house , and it was a jewel of coziness when we finally had everything arranged to our satisfaction . Jane got out her brushes and paints and easel . I decided to bird-watch . I had some books on Arizona birds . We had a visitor about five days after we moved in . He was a grumpy old man , older than I at any rate , and much grumpier . He was from Iowa , had made his money in the haberdashery business , and had come to southern Arizona to get away from the severe Iowa winters and to see if the climate would help his wife 's asthma . " She never had a comfortable day in Iowa , " he said , " Here she can sleep nights again . " " How long have you been here ? " I asked . " Going on four years now . " " How do you like it ? " " Why , the weather 's right enough , but there 's something wrong with the place . " " How do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't rightly know . But it seems like when you do a favor or something for anybody out here , they turn against you . " " That 's odd , " I said . " It ai n't odd , " said the grumpy old Iowan . " It 's the work of the Devil . It ai n't only people does it to you ; it 's everything . " " I do n't understand , " I said . " Well , it 's like this , " he explained . " My missus is a friendly type woman . She likes people ; that is , she did . Well , we had a neighbor when we first came here . Young woman married to a young fellah who worked in the defense plant . Lived right next door to us . Well , my missus went over there calling one day , and the young woman she was there with her baby , and the baby was sick , and the house looked awful ; and my missus hates a messed-up house . So she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey , and I 'll kinda straighten up a little for you . ' And she ( lid it . She made the beds and swept the floor and did the dishes , stacks of dishes . And the young woman was real grateful , and the baby got better , and my missus felt like she had done a good deed . She told me so when she came home . " Next day she went over there again . The house was still kinda clean , but there was that sink again piled high with dirty dishes , and the young woman said the baby had been so pickety and fretful that she just had n't had the time to get to her dishes . So my missus said , ' Honey , you just sit there and tend your baby , and 111 do your dishes . ' So she did them , stacks of them . And then she sat and visited with the young woman for a spell and then she came on home . " Well , after a couple of more days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there the house was looking like the city dump , and the sink piled high with dirty dishes . And this time the baby was n't even sick . It was laughing in its crib . My missus she just sat this time and never offered to do anything ; and when she left the young woman did n't ask her to come back again . And the young woman also told some of her friends that my missus was a nosy old fool that liked to stick her beak into other folk 's business . " ' Well , ' I said , ' Mother , those things happen . You did that young woman a good turn , but she did n't appreciate it . Thank goodness , everybody is n't like that . ' " That 's what I thought . Till it got to be my turn . " I was driving back from town , see , and there 's a fellow and his wife that we knew slightly standing by their car in the middle of the road . Their car had gone dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shove . They were real grateful and said thanks and hopped into their car , and I drove up slow till the bumpers touched and started to shove them . Well , I shoved them maybe a mile , and there was a chug hole or something in theroad , and his bumper went down and my bumper went up ; and the things latched . He was a real excitable fellah , and he jumped out of his car and started cussing me for not driving more careful , specially when 1 was pushing him . I told him to settle clown and take it easy . I got a tire iron and prized the bumpers apart . Then I told him to get back in his car , and I 'd push him the rest of the way . Which I did . " Well , it seems when I prized the bumpers apart with the tire iron I must of bunged his up some way , because when we got to his place and stopped and I backed away , why , his rear bumper came away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came at me till he saw I still had that tire iron in my hand . " I drove off . He sued me for damaging his car , and I had to pay . I said to Mother : ' Next time you see me doing anything in the way of a favor for anybody , kick me quick so 's stop . ' " ' You do the same for me , ' said Mother . And we 've never done any favors since . It 's not safe to do favors in Manacle . Something about the place . " I asked him why he and his wife kept staying on at Manacle if they disliked the people so . " Revenge , " he said . " I put my curse on this place , and me and Mother are staying here to watch it work . " " Is it working ? " I asked . " Something 's working , " he said with a mixture of a snort and a laugh . " The defense plant 's shut down . There ai n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so snotty with my missus had to go back to her folks in Oklahoma with her baby when her husband ran off with another woman . That sweet-tempered fellah I gave the push for when his car was stalled got fired when the plant closed and Iost his house and his car , too . It 's that way with everybody . Except me and Mother . We ai n't dependent on any defense plant . If it ai n't my curse that 's working on Manacle , it 's somebody 's curse . And that 's good enough for me and Mother . " Mind you , " he concluded , " I never had the idea of doing you a favor when I stopped by here to say hello . And do n't get the idea that I have done you a favor . I ai n't . I have given you a warning and that 's all . I do n't do favors any more . " W I T H that he left , and Jane came out of the house to see who it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old nut with a grudge against the world , " I said . " Because of a few coincidental irks , he thinks everybody 's against him . He just stopped by to warn me about Manacle . " " But why should he warn you ? " asked Jane . " And against what ? " " He says he put a curse on Manacle , " I explained , " and he seemed to imply that the curse might affect us , too . " " Where 's the old buzzard from ? " asked Jane . " Iowa . " " Is there anything particularly lethal about an lowan 's curse ? " " He seemed to think there was . " " Well , I feel sorry for him , " said Jane . " It 's such beautiful country here . His attitude seems so silly . Is there any way of avoiding his curse ? " " I 'm not sure , " I said , " but from what I gathered the best way is not to do favors for anyone . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jane , " that should be easy enough for us , for we arc very selfish people , and doing Favors is absolutely foreign to our natures . When is the last time you did a favor for anyone ? " I tried to think back but could n't remember a single one . Jane said : " Well , curse or no curse , we 'll have to chance it and drive into Manacle to get some groceries . Let 's take the Cadillac instead of the pickup , and not look so ranchcrish for a change . " S 0 W E got into the Cadillac , and we sped along over the beautifully tended gravel descrc road . We had driven perhaps two miles when up ahead we saw a girl standing beside a body in the road , and the girl was trying to wave us down . I slowed and stopped . " Something 's happened to Jim , " the girl wailed . " We were just taking a hike , and he grabbed his side and fell over and groaned . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can try , " I said , and I leaned over to help Jim up . But Jim sprang up of his own accord and thrust a revolver  --  which he had concealed under his prone body  --  in my face . " Hands up , Grandpa , " he snarled . " Hands up . Back tip . Turn around . Kneel clown . Put your hands behind you . Put the cuffs on him , Nellie Rose . Get out of the car , Grandma . Hurry up . Kneel down . Put the cuffs on her , too , Nellie Rose . Now both of you stay put till you count five hundred and twenty-seven . " Then he and the girl leaped into the Cadillac and drove off . Jane and I helped each other to our feet . " Do n't swear , " said Jane . " It does n't do any good . Somebody will catch them . Can you walk with your hands that way ? " " I think so , " I said . " Can you get the cigarettes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we knelt down behind each other by turns to get lights from her cigarette lighter . Hut we could n't flick ashes or manage the cigarettes after they were lighted , so we spat them out . " This is a well-traveled road , " said Jane . " Let 's just start ambling toward town , and somebody will be along and pick us up in a jiffy . " " The Iowan 's curse does n't waste any time , " I said . " You noticed , did n't you , how it took hold the moment we started to do what we thought was a favor for those delightful young people ? " " Yes , I noticed , " said Jane . " And if an Iowan can make his curse stick , why ca n't I ? I hereby put my curse upon both the young man and the young lady . " " So do I , " I said . And I also said : " Look , there 's a car coming . Wave your head at it or something so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to see the sheriff , the high sheriff , of this benighted county . " Jane waved her head ; the car cut out to the side of the road to avoid us and barreled on past at fifty miles an hour . " My , but people are accommodating in this country , " said Jane . " Maybe they , too , have also heard of the lowan 's curse , " I said . " Chin up . Stride along . There will be more cars . " There were . There must have been seven more . And each one swerved and passed us as if we were exposed booby traps with warning flares on every side . " Really , " said Jane after a while , " that curse thing is n't as funny as I naively supposed it to be . How much Farther is it to the vile little hamlet known as Manacle ? " " I can see its spires and towers now through the gentle desert haze , " I said . " We will be there in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk I have ever experienced . I ache from my shoulder blades to my heels . I have a headache . I need a drink . I shall not burden you now with how I feel about that adolescent bushwhacker and his scabrous camp follower . " " Tell me about the way the Chinese Communists torture people , dear , " said Jane . So I told her about that until we enterer the fringes of Manacle and found a house with a telephone . We kicked against the door because we could not knock , and the startled inmates summoned the authorities . T UCSON police caught the young couple who had robbed us of our Cadillac , but not before the young couple had run the Cadillac off the road and set it afire . The fellow and his girl were wanted on a homicide charge in California and were extradited there to stand trial , California 's case having precedence over mine and Jane 's . So we never had the pleasure of appearing as witnesses against them in court and watching them wince as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proxy for us . The young man was sentenced to death on the homicide charge , and the young lady was sent to a hospital for the criminally insane . In a way we felt recompensed . The Cadillac 's insurance provided us with a new Cadillac . " See , " I said to Jane , when the new Cadillac was delivered , " the Iowan 's curse was only a transitory thing . In a way everything has turned out for the better . " " Uh huh , " said Jane . " That reminds me . I did n't tell you about the men from the air base who were out here quail hunting , did I ? " " No , ' ' I said , still admiring the new Cadillac . " What about the quail hunters from the air base ? " " Weil , " said Jane , " when you were in town getting gasoline put in the new Cadillac there was some shooting in the direction of the Cathedral rock where you feed the quail . I went over there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had killed a lot of quail ; they had them in the jeep thing they were driving . I told them they were hunting on private property , which was against the law be ? cause the property was posted , but if they would just leave and not kill any more of our quail I would do them a favor and not take down the jeep thing 's number and report them to the air base and also to the game warden . " " Hold it , " I said . " You told them you would do them a favor ? " " Uh huh , " said Jane . " And I nearly bit my tongue off after I did it . " " Well . . . go on , " I said . " They left , " said Jane briefly . " They had been drinking . They called me Grandma and said a lot of insulting things about how I looked in my shorts . But they left . " " How did they get out ? " I asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They drove their jeep thing right through our fence . There 's two big crash-throughs in the fence now . " " Did you get their car number ? " I demanded . " No , " said Jane . " That was just a bluff . " I put in a long-distance call to the air base , demanded to speak to the commanding officer , and was shunted over to some underling chicken colonel who was sincere but rather feeble . " We have over three thousand men here , " he said , " It 'll be hard to identify the ones you have accused from what you have told me . A lot of them go hunting , you know , But I 'll try . I 'll call you back if I can find out anything . " He called back the next day . He 'd checked with the provost marshal , he said , and found that three enlisted men who had been quail hunting up in our neighborhood had met with an accident on their return to the base and were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seemed that the men had gotten drunk on the trip and had smacked their jeep into a bridge abutment . Two had spinal injuries and broken legs , and the third had a broken neck . The colonel asked if I wanted to prefer charges against them after the base medics got them patched up . " No , " I said . " Let it drop . " I told Jane what the colonel had reported , and I said : " Is n't there some theory or other about passive revenge ? The idea that when somebody does you dirt , you do n't actively do any-thing in return but just sit back and wait , and , sooner or later , Old Nobodaddy or the Sea Hag or the Norns catch up with them and deal it out good ? " " I do n't remember reading anything like that , " said Jane , " hut it sounds reasonable . If the author wants any new case histories to use when he brings out a new edition of his theory we can give him some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm disturbed , " I said . " Nothing like this has ever happened to us before . The whole pattern seems so vicious . People go out of their way to injure us in some manner ; we sit back in dismay and anger because we can do nothing about it , and then , barn ! The sky caves in on them without our moving a finger . But why ? " " Oh , for Heaven 's sake , " said Jane . " There have been some coincidences , and that 's all . Our experience is probably universal . Do n't make so much over it . Stop acting as if there 's a big eye up there somewhere brooding over our next moves and tentatively pulling the strings of its evil puppets . " " I can not deny the reasonableness of your conclusions , " I sighed . " But , nevertheless , I do not care to mix again with the human species  --  yourself excepted  --  for a spate of days . Gather up your paints and your easel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bird seed . Let us go out amidst our ten acres , you to paint its beauties , and I to feed its avians . There , let the eye brood down upon us ; let the Iowan brew his curses as he wills . " " You pompous old fool ! " said Jane . " But it is a good idea . Come on , let 's go . " I N THE sunlight among the mesquite and paloverdc trees , the world was at her loveliest that gentle autumn afternoon . I spread out some viands for the desert birds and sprawled beside Jane as she daubed with her colors . We had brought along a lunch basket and some cans of beer . " I had a letter yesterday , " said Jane chattily , " from Mrs. So-and-so in Tucson . They are trying to start up a new art gallery there , and she said the hanging committee would consider it a great favor if I would submit some of my paintings for their first exhibit . She mentioned ' Caverns ' particularly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . " " A hanging committee asked you to do it a favor ? " I shuddered . " No , Jane , no ! A thousand times no . The potentialities are just too horrible . " She hit me lightly with a paint brush , and we laughed . But presently she stopped laughing . " Darn you , " she said ; " now I am afraid to send them my paintings . But how silly . They are nice people . " " Oh , I was only joking , " I said . " We are not misanthropic hermits in hiding from every manifestation of our kind . You will be doing them a favor . The Tucson artists are not fleeing felons or drunken airmen . " I arose to get us each a can of beer , and , as I did so , I dislodged a flat rock . The dislodgement disclosed a little straw-colored scorpion which had been nesting there . He waved his crab-like pincers in dismay at being disturbed . " Tiny fiend , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear no animosity . Return to your haven and slumber again in peace . " And I carefully put the rock down upon him . " Stand beside that big mesquite , " Jane directed . " I want to paint a faun among the brambles . I have the brambles ; now I need the faun . " So , with a beer can in one hand and a cigarette in the other , I posed faunlike beside the big mesquite tree ; and I could hear the birds quarrel as they pecked at the food I had placed for them . Then Jane , who worked rapidly , sketched in her faun among the brambles , and told me I might stop the posing ; and I returned to her side and lay clown upon the warm desert soil . I felt a stab between my shoulder blades and then pain such as if a thousand bees had string me . It was radiating pain , and made me vomit . In my agony I tramped upon the little scorpion which had bitten me ; then Jane helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my legs went dead just as Jane was able to get me in the car . With one hand she held a handkerchief full of ice cubes against the spot where I had been stung ; with the other hand she drove the Cadillac . At the clinic in Manacle they injected me with that blessed anti-scorpion serum which Dr. Stahnke , the genius at the state college in Tempe , had developed . I was in the hospital overnight ; and Jane took me home the next clay . Three days later I was my old self again . ' I had a siege of hysterics when you were in the hospital , " Jane said . " And I 'm not an hysterical woman . I 'm not superstitious , either . And I 'm not crazy . But I 'm not going to send any paintings to that Tucson show . " " Are you afraid ? " I asked . " Yes . I am afraid . " And we let it go at that . But our days became rather snarled affairs . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nerves , we who had been married so long that we were as one person , never saying anything without saying it to the other , never making a decision without making it with the other , never doing anything without doing it with the other . Never sleeping , eating , rising , traveling , dreaming , or praying as one alone but always with the other . This was our harmony and our strength . Finally Jane said : " This is awful . Are you afraid of doing me a favor ? " " I was afraid , " I said slowly , " that you were afraid that I might do you a favor . " Then we both laughed , and the - tension of clays was eased . She said : " We have been making mountains out of molehills . We are selfish people . We have always considered our own lives and our own felicity as paramount to everything . We have always repelled the encroachment of others . " " I think it is being brought home to us , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviolable , Perhaps it is a lesson we have needed for a long time . " " Perhaps , " agreed Jane . " Or , on the other hand , perhaps the whole concatenation has been nothing but nonsense . Let 's start going out again just as if nothing had happened . I will call Mrs. So-and-so in Tucson and tell her I 'll be delighted to enter my pictures in their show . And you can drive us to Tucson , and we will enter them . That is something neither of us wants to do , because I am sensitive about my painting and resent any criticism of them , and you hate affairs of the sort  --  cocktail parties , mingling , chitchat , So let 's go . Let 's do something we do n't like and see what happens . " I started to protest , then found myself in agreement with her . For it was necessary that we did du something , and not sit there any longer in our ten acres trying not to get on each other 's nerves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news . Next day we put the pictures in the Cadillac , and I drove us clown to Tucson . There is only the one road , and it goes through Manacle . The streets were dilapidated but pretty enough in their soft decaying way , lined as they were with crumbly adobe houses and shoddy little businesses . Then we drove through Manacle 's subdivision  --  Sunrise Heights  --  built by thegovernment to house the defense plant workers which Manacle itself could not accommodate . Tumbleweeds and old papers blew through Sunrise Heights . The windows in the once neat little houses had been smashed by rocks , thrown no doubt by roving bands of Manacle 's young manhood . The roofs were cracking , the paint fading and peeling in the remorseless sun . Manacle itself was nearly one hundred years old , and bore its age  --  and its disgrace  --  with a sort of sullen dignity . Its subdivision of Sunrise Heights was only ten years old ; now dead , it resembled a toy some delinquent child had abused . Neither of us wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The defense plant was closed because the weapon it had manufactured had become obsolete . Sunrise Heights was empty because the people who had lived there had been forced to go elsewhere to find employment . The young marauders from Manacle had wrecked the Sunrise Heights windows because Manacle was a dull place , and there was nothing else to do . The fact that a grumpy old Iowan had cursed the pla.ce had nothing to do with it . .. nothing . Or to do with us . So we drove on to Tucson and found the house where our hostess lived , Mrs. So-and-so who had asked Jane to do the artist group a favor by lending her paintings for the exhibit . W E WERE to stay two nights , attending the show the first night and being entertained the second clay and night . There was a trip to Nogales , Mexico , planned for us , and a reception and cocktail party . The art show , the reception , and the cocktail party were much as I had expected they would be  --  rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1 could see , were the only ones of merit in the show , except some by Mark Voris , who was then as always Arizona 's finest painter . But I had been looking forward to the trip to Nogales . It would be our first visit to Mexico ; and old travelers always enjoy seeing new countries . Our hosts and Jane and I decided to go in our Cadillac , because the car was roomy and I liked to drive . We set out in the afternoon , an afternoon of gold and silV ( ; 17 and green , and our hearts were light . We paused not at all in Nogales , Arizona , but crossed over immediately to the Mexican Nogales . Jane and our hostess began a round of the curio shops , those curiously-alike little cubicles with their curiously-alike wares and their 46 THE IOWAN 'S CURSE curiously-alike methods of bargaining . Are they all owned by the same person , and is the competition nothing but sham ? One wonders . Our host and I found without difficulty a little drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their jimcrack curios . The tequila was good , but there was a shoddy cheapness about the town which depressed me . I had a vague , uncomfortable feeling of being cheated whenever I paid out money for anything there . A little boy came in the bar where we sat , stood by diffidently for a moment , and then in rather good English offered to guard the Cadillac for us . I laughed and asked our host : ( 1 ) Was it necessary to have one 's car guarded in this country , and ( 2 ) Was it customary ? Our host laughed in return and said that while lie could n't speak for the necessity it was , nevertheless , more or less customary ; people were wretchedly poor here as a rule , the little boys made a sort of living " guarding " tourists ' cars , and I would probably be doing the lad 's family a favor in paying him to guard mine . I winced at that remark . Had I had a little more tequila , I probably would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy . But I had had only enough tequila to make me feel genial , so I said : " Well , child , guard the car , but do n't get your dirty finger prints on it , " and l gave him a dime . He left with an odd look on his face . Jane and our hostess , after an interminable time , finished their shopping , looked us up , and announced it was time for dinner . We put their purchases in the Cadillac and went off to a restaurant for some genuine Mexican food . We had enchiladas and tamales and dishes of that sort , and more to drink . I enjoyed the meal ; Jane chattered like a magpie ; we were having a very good time . Then horrid things began to happen . After dinner as I drove back toward Tucson , I was halted by highway patrolmen on the way , and cited for speeding , drunken driving , and endangering human lives . The officers ordered me out of the driver 's scat and ordered our host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to appear in court the next morning . I appeared in traffic court  --  our host driving me there in his car  --  and was fined one hundred dollars , but was allowed to keep my driver 's license and to escape a jail term because of extenuating circumstances . When we returned , our hostess asked in trembling fashion if I had looked at the Cadillac. replied with an irritable no and asked what was wrong with it . Mutely , she led me out . All the knickknacks she and lane had bought had been stolen . So had the hubcaps . The rear tires had been slashed , but had held up . The paint along the sides had been scored as if with a beer can opener . Obscene words in both Spanish and English had been daubed on the back . All this had happened in Mexico , but such had been our travail that it had gone unnoticed till our hostess had gone out to get her purchases . " But I thought , " protested Jane , " that you paid a little boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I did it as a favor . We did everybody a favor , now that I think back . " W E WENT hack to our ten acres at Manacle as soon as feasible , driving past the dead defense plant , past the withering Sunrise Heights , and through the malignant heart of Manacle . It was a very gray day ; our ten acres looked wistful and unhappy ; the outcropped rock " Cathedral " looked like a decayed and aching tooth . " Let 's move , " said Jane . " I ca n't stand it any longer . Let 's get away from here . I have begun to hate , and I do n't like to hate . " " I 'll put up the place for sale , " I said . " I 'll order a truck . We can start packing today . We can be gone in two days . Where do you want to go ? " " New York , I guess , " said Jane gloomily . " For a while at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I called our realty broker in Tucson and told him to put our place on the market . I called a van line and told them to send a van around the next day to pick up our stuff and put it in storage . " It wo n't take two clays , " I told Jane . " We can leave tomorrow . We will be doing ourselves and this place , too , a favor . " Jane brightened up . The air outside became gusty ; rain began to fall . I built a fire in our fireplace , and I brought out a bottle of German wine . We toasted the imminence of our departure , and , as the rain poured down with new intensity , dared the elements to do their worst . The elements accepted the dare . Rains in that part of Arizona are always sparse affairs , and a hall-inch precipitatiOn is accounted almost a cloudburst . This time it rained that half-inch in less than half an hour , and still the inundation kept pouring from the skies . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ponds all over our front yard ; the patio was full of water ; the Cadillac stood in water up to its whitewalls in the ramada . There was no wind , and there was no break in the sky . There was only blackness and furious , unceasing rain . The land was flat ; there was no place for the rain to go after it fell ; it piled up and made ponds and lakes in every little declivity and every hollow . I returned to Jane and the fireplace and the wine . But I was uneasy and after fifteen minutes I went again to the door and again looked out . The water was over our porch step . Everywhere I looked was water . The Cadillac was hubcap deep in water under the ramada . Then I became afraid , and I told Jane we were on the verge of being flooded out . " Nothing would surprise me less , " she snapped . " But what can we do about it ? " That was the point . What could we do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was already bogged . The nearest habitation to ours was more than a mile away and was unquestionably in similar plight . And then I remembered what I had read about flash floods : The water piles up in some hitherto dry mountain gulch or gulley , then suddenly bursts out and swamps the lowlands with a roar . All this rain was piling up in the mountains north of us ; the drainage flowed our way ; it was only a matter of time until a whole wild sea would be upon us . " Come , " I said to Jane . " We 've got to go . " And I explained the situation to her . " But where can we go ? " she protested . T HERE was only one place . That was the rock outcropping on our acres , the ugly " Cathedral . " It was thirty feet high . It would be a place of refuge . We put on our raincoats and hats , as if we were going to the store , and waded  --  sometimes knee-deep  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon its top ; and the rain poured down . We sat there all that night . When dawn came we watched the flash flood come with it  --  nothing really flashy , just a swell and a billow that surged across the lake which already covered our ten acres and all the surrounding land . The Cadillac rolled over on its side and wobbled helplessly . Our house disintegrated a wall at a time ; our things floated , a chair here , a paper there . Around eight o'clock the rain stopped . About noon a helicopter fluttered by and rescued Jane and me . Nearly ten inches of rain had fallen . It was the worst flood ever recorded in that part of Arizona . After our rescue everything became rather academic . We refugeed for two days in Manacle which was on high ground and escaped most of the flood . When the water went down we hired a man to drive us to Tucson where we would catch plane , train , or even bus to get us out and to keep us going . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man companionably pointed out the high points of the flood 's devastation . " Over there , " he said , indicating the remnants of a house , " was where an old grouch from Iowa lived . But he 'd already left before the rain started . " " What caused him to do that ?
