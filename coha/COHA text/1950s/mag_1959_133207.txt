As most of the coaches will agree , a share of the credit belongs to the high schools in the area , which every year produce a flood of fine players who not only star in the Big Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At MICHIGAN STATE this year Coach Forddy Anderson will have no height , little experience and only the pretense of a bench , which means the Spartans will be extremely dangerous ; Forddy will be improvising , and he is the best coach in the league when it comes to transmuting dross to gold . How he defends against the giants whom State must face should be interesting . He does have speed , in the persons of Horace Walker , Dave Fahs , Lance Olson and Dave Scott . Leading candidates to join them as regulars are Art Gowens , Jim Bechinski , Bill Golis , Bud Fanning , Dave Richey , John Young and Tom Wilson . Run , pass and shoot will be State 's offense , and the shooting will be the most important feature , since the team can not hope to rebound with the rest of the conference . INDIANA will field a tall , all-veteran outfit that was the best-shooting team in the school 's history last season . This starting crew includes only one senior , Frank Radovich , which means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Radovich up front are LeRoy Johnson and a 6-foot-11 boardsweeper named Walt Bellamy who is also a fine shooter . This lanky trio averaged 39 points a game last year . Bellamy pulled down more than 15 rebounds each time , and hit on better than 50% of his field goal tries . Tough as it appears , a 6-foot-7 sophomore , Gordon Mickey , may well replace one of the forwards by the end of the season . He is easily the best of a list of talented newcomers . Regular guards are the slick and speedy Herbie Lee and Gary Long ; Bob Wilkinson , a fine play-maker , returns after a year of scholastic ineligibility to fight for his job . Reserves include the veterans Norbert Witte , Allen Schlegelmilch and Glen Butte and sophomores Bill Altman , Jerry Bass , Charles Hall and Ernie Wilhoit . The Hoosiers lost five of their last seven games a year ago , chiefly because of inexperience ; this time around they may be one of the best in the nation . Ohio State and Illinois ( and the pesky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title race . At OHIO STATE a fine bunch of sophomores moves up to join three veteran starters and make up a tall , fast squad that shoots well and rebounds strongly . One of the most talked-about sophomores in the nation , 6-foot-8 Jerry Lucas , will start at center , with double-figure scorers Dick Furry and Joe Roberts on either side of him . Roberts , an extremely graceful and talented athlete , has been something of a disappointment in the past because he has played up to his ability only in streaks . He is a senior this year and appears far less erratic . Another sophomore starter , Mel Nowell , will enjoy the benefit of veteran guidance when he lines up next to one of the best guards in the conference , Larry Siegfried , who led the team in scoring last year . In addition to a starting five which averages slightly over 6 feet 5 , plenty of reserve height is furnished by Richie Hoyt , Howard Nourse and John Cedargren . Another sophomore receiving starting consideration is Forward John Havlicek , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gary Gearhart and J. T. Landes , give OSU a vastly improved bench . ILLINOIS has lost its sparkplug Guard Roger Taylor , but picks up plenty of compensating power . The squad has balance , speed , depth and rebounding strength . Harry Combes , who has never had a losing team in his 12 years as coach , has four returning starters who average almost 6 feet 5 , and a plentiful supply of reserves and sophomores with similar measurements . The all-veteran front line includes Govoner Vaughn , an accurate jump shooter , and Ed Perry and junior Center John Wessels . One of the league 's better guards is Mannie Jackson , who will be joined by Lee Frandsen , Lou Landt or sophomore Gerald Colangelo . High-jumping sophomore Ed Searcy , 6 feet 5 , is a strong boardman and may earn a starting spot up front . Reserve forwards are lettermen Al Gosnell and Bruce Bunkenburg , while 6-foot-8 Verne Altemeyer adds depth at center . Sophomores Doug Mills , Bob Starnes and Jerry Curless complete the squad . Popular John Kundla returns as coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the prestige that is rightfully his after having coached the professional Minneapolis Lakers to six world championships . In the future he will undoubtedly attract to the university many of the better high school players of the state ; and Minnesota has lately taken to basketball with the fervor of Indiana and Ohio . Despite their ninth-place finish last year , the Gophers are valid championship contenders now . Kundla has six veterans who alternated as starters last year , including 6-foot-7 Center Ron Johnson , the only junior named to the all-Big Ten team . He was the team 's top scorer last year , with a 20-point average , and its best rebounder . Kundla had already earmarked him for the Lakers before he decided to take the coaching job at Minnesota . Veteran Gerald Butler switches from center to forward , where he joins senior starter Tom Benson . The team 's best guard , junior Paul Lehman , is hampered by a knee injury but will start alongside Mario Miller . Forward Dick Erickson is the sixth returning starter , and Tom Skadeland has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , where letterman Curt Thalberg regains eligibility at midyear . Kundla 's biggest problems are to coax more scoring from the forwards and to develop a floor leader in the backcourt . Sophomores who will play often include Forwards Ray Cronk and Norm Grow , Guards Wes Hiller and Cal Sabatini . IOWA has endured hard times for the past few years , but three veteran starters , plus the return of spirited Guard Ron Zagar to eligibility , give Coach Sharm Scheuerman a measure of hope for a first-division finish . The team 's biggest problem is lack of experience and scoring punch up front , where 6-foot-7 Nolden Gentry is almost alone . Frank Mundt and Denny Runge , 6 feet 8 and 6 feet 9 respectively , saw limited action last year , as did Mike Dull . The Hawkeyes are deep in talented guards , with starters Mike Heitman , Bob Washington and Zagar . Pete Schebler , Bob Carpenter and Les Kewney are backcourt reserves . The looked-for increase in point production will have to come from sophomores , the best of whom is 6-foot-5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Mike Woods , Joe Novak , Gary Lorenz and Dave Maher . The rest of the league must also look to sophomores as the key to any first-division plans , NORTHWESTERN faces a major rebuilding job after losing four regulars , including all-conference Center Joe Ruklick and the team 's three top scorers . Forward Willie Jones and Guard Floyd Campbell will lead a team that has exceptional speed to compensate for barely adequate height and a weak bench . Two sophomores , Ralph Wells and Bill Cacciatore , are competing for the other starting guard position , but Ed Radtke is the only new prospect in the shallow front line . Lack of experience in the pivot means the Wildcats probably will shuttle three men , Chuck Brandt , Jerry Greer and Bill North , under the basket . The only other returnee is Forward Brad Snyder , PURDUE , which shares with Wisconsin the distinction of having won the most Big Ten titles ( 13 apiece ) , faces a substantial drop in the standings . Stripped of his six top players by graduation , Coach Ray Eddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Center Terry Dischinger and Forwards Darrel McQuitty , Phil Wills and Jerry Berkshire , with an average height of 6 feet 5 . The guards are 1959 reserves Bob Orrill and Dick Mitchell , while the only other returning reserves are Forwards Paul Conwell and Bob Motsinger . Last year 's Boilermakers had great talent that never jelled ; this year 's crew has the advantage , at least , of not being expected to take first place . WISCONSIN 'S fine old tradition of good basketball took its worst beating last winter when the Badgers tumbled into the Big Ten cellar for the very first time . A new coaching staff , headed by John Erickson , hopes to reverse the downward trend , but does n't have the happiest of prospects . If the Badgers go anywhere at all , much help must come from sophomores Jack Kotter , an alert 6-foot-7 center , Jack Ulwelling and Tom Hughbanks . Starting Forwards Bob Barneson and Jim Biggs are the only first-string holdovers . Reserves include Fred Clow , Dick Dutrisac , Rick Murray , Bob Rossin , Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Zwakman . Erickson hopes to use a running game , a considerable break with the past , but that depends primarily on board control , and his squad may not be up to such performance . The best team MICHIGAN had in 11 years is gone . M. C. Burton , Big Ten rebounding and scoring champ last year , prepares for medical school , and Coach Bill Perigo prepares to rebuild . John Tidwell , who plays anywhere , is the heart of this year 's team , along with Guard Terry Miller , its floor leader . These two are the only ones who have shown scoring ability . Center Lovell Farris , only 6 feet 3 , characterizes the squad 's serious lack of height . Most likely new starters are rugged Scott Maentz and Bob Brown , who will be available now that the football season is finished . Reserves include Rich Donley , Gary Kane , Dale Kingsbury , Rich Robins , Jim Burns , Arlen Parker , Denis Robison , Dick Clark and Bob Brown .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
