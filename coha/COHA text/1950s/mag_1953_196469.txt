Bleary-eyed from 3-D and other new projection systems , and suffering from the collywobbles of TV competition , some 1,000 movie theater owners met in Chicago 's Conrad Hilton Hotel last week to look into a fourth dimension : the future . What they saw depended on who was in the projection booth . <P> Twentieth Century-Fox President Spyros P. Skouras , there to boost Cinema-Scope , flashed a gloomy picture on the screen . Said he : " Over 6.000 theaters have been closed since 1946 . Do n't be misled . What happened to those people can happen to you . . . Television is the greatest enemy the industry ever had . " <P> From one of their own kind , however , the theater owners got a brighter image . Said Leonard H. Goldenson , president of American Broadcasting-Paramount Theaters , Inc. : TV and the movies are so different that they are not truly competitive . " One is the ' athome snack ' while the other is a seven-course meal at a sumptuous restaurant . And television will no more put motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be-has put restaurants out of business . " <P> Which of the new projection systems will win out-3-D , CinemaScope , Cinerama or some new system ? Most of the theater owners thought that no one system will dominate the field , but that theaters will be equipped to handle a variety of projection methods depending on the film . Harvey Fleischman , district manager of the Wometco theater chain ( 32 theaters ) in southern Florida and the Bahamas , summed up : " Cinerama , because of the size of its equipment , is impractical for most theaters . It will be confined to special productions in certain big houses . CinemaScope is impractical for some small theaters , fine for the larger houses . Three-dimensional films are finished as a novelty , but people will buy 3-D if the story is pleasing . And good movies will still be made in standard 2-D . "
