( See Cover ) <P> When people lived in houses , not apartments , they generally had attics . Their purpose : a storage place for things so dear to their owners ' hearts that they could n't be thrown away . In time , these has-beens turned ( some of them ) to heirlooms . This is the case for attics . <P> A civilization 's attics are its museums . Here yesterday 's knickknacks are squirreled away , in the somewhat less haphazard hope that some of them will turn to treasure . The custodians of civilization 's attics must be knowledgeable men , able to tell a hawk from a handsaw , for their yesterday goes back to history 's dawn , and their attic 's room-like their budget - is strictly limited . Peering at relics is an increasingly popular pastime , for mankind is increasingly curious about the past , and its tenacious connection with the present . This is the case for museums . <P> Last year more people ( 2,263,336 ) went to New York 's Metropolitan Museum than to the Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half that number . The box-office increase is largely credited to the epigrammatical , blunt showman who for twelve years has been the museum 's director : Francis Henry Taylor . Says Taylor : " Showmanship should never show . But if you have n't got it , you have the kiss of death . " <P> In his 25-year career , Taylor has come to some other conclusions about his job : <P> " We in the art museums of America have reached a point where we must make a choice of becoming either temples of learning and understanding ... or of remaining merely hanging gardens for the perpetuation of the Babylonian pleasures of estheticism and the secret sins of private archeology . " <P> " The American museum is , after all , neither an abandoned European palace nor a solution for storing and classifying the accumulated national wealth of the past . It is an American phenomenon , developed by the people , for the people . . . " <P> " Instead of trying to interpret our collections , we have deliberately high-hatted the man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . . . frankly bored with museums and their inability to render adequate service . They have had their bellyful of prestige and pink Tennessee marble . " <P> Sightseer 's Digest . Though the Metropolitan has its share of pink marble , Taylor 's museum high-hats nobody . Last week , as every week , a steady stream of schoolchildren , college students , housewives , tourists and casual visitors trooped up the steps and into the cloakroom to check their coats ( no tips allowed ) . <P> They could all find something worth looking at : there were seven special exhibits going at once . On the ground floor were a folk costume show and a comprehensive display of " The Weird " - no etchings , drawings and lithographs from the gruesome isth century genii of Albrecht Diirer to the willowy 20th century witches of Charles Addams ( " May I borrow a cup of cyanide ? " ) . Upstairs were other shows : the Metropolitan 's 30 famed Rembrandts , a collection of miniature objects , earliest American landscapes , contemporary American watercolors , drawings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
