txt Leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations agreed today on a way to get rid of union raiding . The compact was described as the first step toward organic unity of the two organizations . It will release staff energies for organizing the unorganized . Subject to certain ratifications in the meantime , the agreement will go into effect Jan. 1 and run for two years . Ratifications are expected not only by the executive bodies and the conventions of the two federations but by each national and international union . Disputes over interpreting and applying the agreement will go to an impartial umpire if they fail to yield to negotiation . The umpire 's decision will be final . However , no formal disciplinary measures are provided for noncompliance . The agreement deals only with raiding  --  that is , the transfer , or attempt to transfer , a recognized unit of employes from one federation to another . A unit of employes is considered to be the nontransferable property of a union if it has a contract with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A union that receives a unit of empioyes from the other federation , even though it has made no overtures , will be guilty of raiding . Therefore , if a group of employes is dissatisfied with its representa- tion , it can not go over to a union in the other federation without negotiating its release . It can , of course , cut awl ties and become independent . The agreement does not deal with jurisdictional disputes or with rival claims to units of unorganized employes . A jurisdictional dispute , in its common form , is a fight between unions over the right to perform certain work . A. F.

The recent Executive Council meeting set up a three member committee to do something about it . Raiding within the C. I. 0 . is insignificant . Conflicts among C.

It has to be rewritten , but they were so confident of mutual understanding that the job was left entirely to subcommittees . Mr. Meany said " it is just a question of language and details that Walter and I are going to work out . " The rewritten instrument will be ready in time for the August meeting of the A. F. L. Executive Council and for a C. I. 0 . executive meeting about the same time . Both federations will hold conventions in the fall . Raiding Statistics Given Asked what would happen if some affiliate refused to sign the agreement , Mr. Meany said : " If some union does n't go along , it 's outside the agreement .

The A. F. L. was on the gainful side , owning largely to a schism in the C. I. 0 . Textile Workers , which the A. F. L. United Textile Workers exploited . The agreement will not prevent an A. F.

Mr. Reuther said today 's agreement " will have a very good effect on the prospects of organic unity .
