Three months ago , with the help of a local British fisherman , a Polish fishing vessel , apparently in trouble , was guided into the port of Whitby . In incomprehensible Polish and ragged German , seven members of the Polish crew managed to explain that they had locked their captain in the lavatory , the political officer in his cabin , and had headed for Britain to seek asylum from Red rule . <P> The British put the seven mutineers in jail for safekeeping , let the captain out of the lavatory , and gave him back his ship , the Puszczyk ( pronounced , by Poles , pushchick ) . He promptly sailed for Poland with the remaining six loyal crewmen , muttering philosophically : " To me is equal . Those seven wanted to leave . Let them . " <P> <P> But Poland 's Communist government felt differently . First they sent a Polish official in London to see the seven in jail , armed with letters from their relatives . " We had and still have much trouble be cause of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly make a bath for you , " wrote one rebel 's family . The sailors recognized the letters as having been writ ten under pressure . Dropping all pretense , the Polish government brusquely demanded the sailors extradition . <P> Government on Trial . Scrupulously adhering to international law , Britain put the seven on trial for " revolt against the authority of the master of a ship on the high seas . " Britain 's big community of Polish exiles ( 200,000 ) rallied to the sailors ' defense . Mostly veterans of General Wladyslaw Anders ' army , which fought gallantly in Italy , they have little money , bicker constantly over the shadows of power left to their government in exile , but instantly unite when it is a question of combating the Communist Warsaw government . Pennies , shillings and pounds poured in , enough to hire Britain 's top Laborite lawyer , Sir Hartley Shawcross . <P> In London 's musty Bow Street court , crowded with Polish exiles , Shawcross in effect put the Polish government itself on trial . Said he : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It might have been revolt on the high seas , but it was political revolt against political tyranny on a vessel being run by a political officer with more powers than the captain . " He introduced as evidence a persuader found in the political officer 's cabin-a spring-handled bludgeon . " It seems a curious form of political argument , " said Shawcross dryly . <P> Revolt in a Parish . Recognizing a tricky legal issue , the judge referred the case to the High Court of Justice on the ground that there had been no legal reinterpretation of mutiny since the last century . Last week , after hearing Sir Hartley argue that the Puszczyk was in reality " a small territorial unit or parish of Poland , " and that the seamen had only " revolted from what they regarded as the tyranny of a police state , " Lord Goddard , Lord Chief Justice , ordered the prisoners freed . Happily , the Polish community threw a huge coming-out party for the seven , who had established a legal precedent for the kind of age which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
