txt April sales of new autos fell short of both the January and March totals . They were ahead of February . The nation 's 38,000 dealers delivered 362,800 cars in the month for an average of 13,950 cars in each of the 26 selling days . This was a decline of 29.7% from the average daily sales of 19,825 cars in April , 1957 . March sales averaged 14,020 cars a day and January volume averagqd 14,650 cars a day . Only in February , when daily sales dropped to 13,375 , were 1958 sales slower than last month . Sales In Last 10 Days of Month Failure of April 's final 10-day period to show the hoped-for improvement over the second 10 days was mainly responsible for the month 's showing . In that period sales averaged 14,400 cars a day for a rise of only 1 ' .9% from the mid-month average of 14,125 . Between the like two periods of 1957 , the gain was 7.5% . One possible explanation for this was given by an economist for one of the Big Three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of an effect it had , but both Ford and Chevrolet are beginning sales contests this month . There 's a tendency on the part of dealers to hold back on reporting sales in the late part of the preceding month , so they can throw them in as sales during the contest month . With Ford and Chevy selling half the cars in the country , that could account for the fact late April sales did n't rise as much as expected . " The April total also seemed to demonstrate a lack of effectiveness of the 200-odd " Auto Buy " campaigns conducted across the country last month . Matter of Dispute This is a matter of dispute within the companies themselves . " We tell ourselves that , without the " Auto Buy ' drives , our sales would have been even worse , " explains the general manager of one large car-making division . And his sales manager adds : " The results have differed from town to town  --  some places good , other places fair and still others . not good . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting people interested in cars again . Stories are being written in the papers and people are starting to talk cars . " On the other aide of the fence is a researcher for a competing company who says , " frankly , I 've always doubted that sales campaigns add any net sales to the industry . They may help one division gain at the expense of another , or shift sales that might be made later into an earlier month . But I doubt they increase the overall total . " Statistics on April registrations released by the Detroit Automobile Association seemed to show the drive helped sales somewhat in this hard-hit auto capital . Total registrations for April were down only 29% from the April , 1957 , level , while in the first quarter sales , lagged 45% from a year earlier . April registrations in Wayne County ( Detroit ) , moreover , showed a 12% gain over those in March . In 1957 , registration declined 21% in the same interval . The gain was not , however , enough to make the outlook for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , with auto employment certain to drop to much lower levels between now and September , their plight may well worsen . . Depletion of Dealers ' Stocks The one bright spot in the auto sales picture is the depletion of dealers ' inventories of unsold new cars . On May 1 , such stocks amounted to 809,000 cars  --  a drop of 26,000 from the April 20 figure and down about 56,000 from April 1 . On a total basis , stocks are now below the levels of the same months of 1956 , when they last constituted a serious problem for dealers and manufacturers . On the basis of daily supply , however , they are still at burdensome levels . Based on the April selling rate , present stocks equal a 58-day supply  --  against a " desirable " level , in the eyes of auto men of about 30 days .
