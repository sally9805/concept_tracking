T HE big girl Elsa Lutz , and her parents Herr and Frau Heinrich Lutz , were taking their first stroll in dull leisure around the deck . Elsa towered over her rather weedy elders , but walked between them , their obedient child , each holding her by a hand . They stopped and peered downward through an iron grating which rewarded them with a sight of the steerage feeding quarters . There were rows of narrow trestles loaded with food , and long benches ranged beside them . Cooking smells rose warmly , the people were coming in and seating themselves quietly . They recognized , directly under the grating , the billowing back and bowed head of the fat man in the cherry-colored shirt , already at his dinner , helping himself freely from large platters of substantial food in a half circle before him . " Well , God bless us , " said Herr Lutz , in some surprise , and he put on his spectacles for a closer look . " Why , how can they make any profit if they set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , descendant of a long line of hotel keepers , and he had run a hotel of his own in Mexico ; his interest was entirely professional . " Fried potatoes , " he murmured , " there must be a pound of them on his plate . Awhole braised pig 's knuckle , with fried onions , red sweet-sour cabbage , and bean puree  --  well , it 's true none of it is on the expensive side , yet it costs something , after all . And coffee . Fruit besides , and Apfelstrudel  --  no , they ca n't keep it up and break even . Look how that fellow eats ! It makes me hungry to watch him . " H is wife , a dumpy plain woman with a roll of dry faded hair pierced all through with wire hairpins , observed the scene with no change of expression , which had long ago settled into a blend of constant disapproval and righteous ill-humor . " It is only to make a show on the first meal , " she remarked ; " they will economize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new broom , " she said , " sweeps clean . " " Ha , ha , " laughed her husband . " You mean a new customer eats clean . " His daughter joined his merriment dutifully but uneasily , watching her mother . His wife treated the joke with the contempt it merited , keeping her face still long enough for him to see exactly what she thought of his nonsense . Her husband continued his laughter long enough to let her see that he could enjoy his little joke without her . Katherine Anne Porter , author of Pale Horse , Pale Rider , and Flowering Judas , is now at work on a novel , No Safe Harbor , from which " The Prisoner " was taken . The setting is shipboard between Vera Cruz and Bremerhaven ; the time , 1931 . " But Papa , " said Elsa , leaning again over the grating , " had n't you noticed another thing ? The third class is empty almost , only a dozen passengers , and yet they would not sell us third-class tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clerk in Mexico City to tell us there was no room in third class for us ? " " Well , yes , " admitted her father , " in one way . in another way , very good business . Here we are , first-class tickets and all , they have already made more than three hundred and fifty dollars on us ; you turn that into reichsmarks now and you have some real money . . " But there must be some other reason besides , " said Elsa . " Oh yes , there are always a lot of good reasons , and they know them all , for cheating us , " said Frau Lutz grimly . " I wish you might have learned a few of those reasons for your own use , " she told her husband , and long years of deeply cherished , never-tobe-settled grudges lay in her tone . The three walked on , a family clumsiness in their movements , eyes straight ahead and dull with small anxieties . " Answer me one thing , my poor wife , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Did we do so badly in Mexico after all ? In any sense of the word ? Did we by any stretch of your imagination fail ? I think not . " " I no longer care what you think , " said Frau Lutz . " Just the same that does n't keep me from thinking , " said Herr Lutz with calm independence . " And sometime maybe when you happen to be thinking , you might think about how we arc going home , all in good health , with enough money to start our own little hotel in St. Gallen . " " Yes , after all these years , " said his wife , drearily . " Yes , now when it is too late , when nothing will be the same , when Elsa is grown up and a stranger to her own people  --  oh , think what trouble we had to keep her from speaking Spanish first , before her mother tongue . Yes , now of course , we can go back in style , and set up in business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling important , " said Herr Lutz , " let us wait and see . " " Mama , " said Elsa timidly , trying to change the subject , " my cabin mate is that Americangirl who came on board with that light-haired young man . I thought they were married , did n't you ? But no , he is in one cabin and she another . " " I am sorry for that , " said her mother , severely . " 1 had hoped you might be with an older woman , somebody respectable . That girl , I do n't like her looks or her ways , or her dress . Pantaloons , imagine . And is she really traveling with a man who is not her husband ? " " Well , " said Elsa , uncertainly , seeing that this topic was a failure also , " I suppose so . But she is in a separate cabin , after all . " " I hardly see the difference , " said her mother . " I am very sorry . Listen to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that girl , do not take her advice or follow her example in anything . Treat her with perfect coldness , do n't take up with her at all . Never be seen on deck with her . Do n't talk to her , or listen when she talks . " " Yes , Mama , " said Elsa , attentively and submissively . Her father smiled at her and said , " That 's a good girl . You must do as your Mama says . " " But Papa , when she changed to a skirt , she looked like anyone else , she looked very well , not like an American at all . " " Let her alone , just the same , " said Frau Lutz , shaking her head . " She is an American , do n't forget that , no matter how she looks . " T HE bugler stepped out on-deck sounding his merry call for dinner . Instantly the Lutz family faced inward and hastened their steps . At the top of the stairs they were almost overwhelmed from the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , over , and around them like a wave , a wave with elbows . The Lutzes were so outdistanced the Spaniards were already seated at a good-sized round table near the Captain 's , and the six-year old twins were tearing at a dish of celery before a waiter could find the small table set for three  --  against the wall , to be sure , but happily near a porthole . " I am glad to see they have washed their faces , " said Frau Lutz , beginning to read her dinner card with an eye of disgust , " but it would look better all around if they washed their necks , too , I saw very distinctly : their necks were gray and stiff with dirty old powder . Elsa , you wonder why I always say to you , wash your neck . And your wrists , and as for powder , I hope you will never be so foolish . " Elsa glanced down her own nose where the shininess was refracted into her eyes . She rubbed her nose with her handkerchief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFT ER dinner , all the desks in the small rooms off the bar were occupied by absorbed letter-writers , last words to Mexico or messages to Europe , to be mailed at Havana . Only the Spanish dancing women patrolled the deck , living in the moment . It was fairly noticeable that romance of a sort was simmering already around them . Wearing flowers in their hair , reeking of musk and amber , they were to he seen about in shadowy spots , each involved more or less with one of the blond young ship 's officers . The officers were all poor , well disciplined , dedicated to their calling ; they all wore plain gold engagement rings on their left hands , and , bound to their narrow world always in motion , never set foot in any port . It was expensive , it might lead to international complications , and besides there were too many ports . They had clearly defined and not always onerous duties toward female passengers , such as dancing with them of evenings , slighting no one , making themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as carrying an affair too far , but it was not to be supposed that any one of them should not avail himself of opportunities freely offered so long as appearances were preserved . In this case , appearances were to be not preserved but disguised if possible . Their experiences with many female passengers on many voyages to out of the way ports had intimidated them to a certain extent . So , warily one by one , the young officers , in immaculate white , with gold or silver insignias at their collars and shoulders , found themselves on the first evening , in natural gallantry but with some pleasant excitement also , with an arm around a surprisingly muscular but slender Spanish waist , looking with mild expectation into the burning depths of eyes that meant ' business and nothing else . Something always threw them off . Mysteriously the combinations separated , re-formed with different partners , until finally early in the evening , all seemed to be over  --  a question of money , no doubt , decided Wilhelm Freytag , who had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been observing the little scenes here and there . " What else could it be ? " asked Arne Hansen , and he watched one of the girls especially , with his choleric blue eyes softened to simple admiration . She was indeed very beautiful , and though of a type with the others , still Hansen could see a difference in her , or believed he could . They all had fine dark eyes , shining black hair smoothed over their ears , their round hips swayed as they walked , their narrow high-arched feet were stuffed without mercy into thin black satin slippers . All their mouths were brutal , slimy with dark red grease paint ; but the one he preferred was called Amparo , he had found that out . He spoke poor Spanish and so far as he knew , Amparo spoke nothing else . " I ca n't imagine what they do , " said Frey-tag , " besides of course what they are doing now . They look like a set of gypsies . I saw them dancing and collecting money in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . They were a Zarzuela company from Granada , gypsies maybe or pretending to be . They had got stranded in Mexico as such outfits always did , and the Mexican government was sending them home , as usual . at its own expense . Freytag considered they looked a tough lot , the four men especial l y  --  oblique-look ing characters with fine hair oiled to their narrow skulls , their tapering waists cinched in wide leather belts  --  a combination of table-top dancer , maquereau , and plain thug . Hansen studied them . " Not dangerous , " he judged , " unless it was fairly safe . " The men of the dancers ' troupe had been sitting in the bar , with the children , obviously keeping out of the way while their ladies practiced their arts . They were quiet , entirely too graceful in their few movements , and watchful as cats . Sitting over cups of coffee , they smoked endlessly , and the children were subdued in a way they were not when the women were present ; they finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep . A T HAVANA , though it was four o'clock in the afternoon , the Spanish company appeared dressed for the evening , in serviceable black of daring cut , the men with wide red silk belts under their short jackets , the ladies gallantly exposed as to breasts and shoulders . Amparo 's ear lobes were half again their length under the weight of immense imitation ruby earrings . They all limped a little in their cruel foot-gear , as they sat out stubbornly in pain and with bitter faces for an evening of professional gaiety . The children , left on ship , ran in circles on deck for a while , shouting in rebellion . Then they ran to the rail and leaned over , screaming desperately , " Jai-alai , Mamacita , jai-alai ? " A good distance away all four of the women whirled about suddenly , and the one they called Lola shouted back in a deep voice , " Shut up ! " T HE ship , full of fetid port air and swarming with mosquitoes , got under weigh about midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were rather regarded as interlopers by the original voyagers , who had got already a proprietary interest in the ship . A half dozen noisy mongrel Cuban students made themselves conspicuous until a late hour . They formed a parade and marched around and around deck , past portholes and windows of honest citizens trying to sleep , bawling verse after verse about La Cucaracha , the poor riffle cockroach who could not run about any more first because she had no marihuana to smoke , second because she had no money to spend , third because she had no feet anyway , fourth because nobody loved her , and endlessly the students rehearsed her misfortunes as they tramped in a line , hands on each other 's shoulders . They ranged in height from short to tall , but all were very stringy . They wore baggy ' Oxford " trousers , rather lumpy below the knees , identical in cut but of fascinating variety in tartan patterns , stripes , squares , and improbably tinted tweeds . They wore tennis shoes and T-shirts . Occasionally they wove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they leaped rhythmically in turn , beginning at one end of the line and working forward or backward in an ocean-wave effect . Wilhelm Freytag watched their antics for a while , decidedthey were no doubt going to be a complete nuisance for the whole voyage , and wondered if he had ever been so puerile , so callow , so absurd . He was thirty now , and life was a pretty sober business , more than he had bargained for , in fact . Could he have ever been such a fool as that ? He remembered well that he had been , but he had not reached the age of sentimental reminiscence about youthful imbecilities : he was just at the point where he shuddered to be reminded of them . Jenny the American girl and Elsa Lutz , in their stuffy little cabin , were brushing their hair and preparing for sleep in an amiable silence . They had been getting on very well , with small talk about life on the ship , exchange of mild gossip and harmless opinion . Elsa in spite of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gentle , rather orderly ways , and sat by , fascinated , while Jenny did up her face with sweet smelling lotions , and layers of ointment like whipped cream . The roar and tramp of the students passed their porthole for the third time , and again Elsa lifted her head to listen , thoughtfully . " The ship is full of boys now , " she said , almost hopefully . " Very , " said Jenny . " It will be nice if they know more than one song . " They both jumped a little , and listened , staring at each other , to an unusual noise in the passageway just beyond their door : a violent , confused rushing and stumbling about , like a struggle of some kind , ending with a heavy soft thud as if a sandbag had been hurled against the panel . Two voices , male and female , in which they recognized mefribers of the dancing troupe , rose in a fierce quarrel . The quarrel was about money . They screamed hotly in a ragged duet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Manolo . Manolo wanted , he wanted with no more talk , instantly , the seven Cuban pesos he knew Concha had got that evening . He had seen the man give her the change after paying the bartender . Concha denied it brazenly , she was shrewish and fearless . Jenny , following the logic of the battle , realized that Concha did not for a moment question Manolo 's right to the money if she had it to give . She took what might seem the easy way out and denied that she had it . it was not going to be easy . " I saw it , " said Manolo ferociously . " Give it me or I 'll xip your lying tongue out . " Concha screamed that he could tear her entrails out if he liked , he would not find the money . ' Their voices joined again and crashed like breaking crockery , then stopped suddenly with the sound of a ringing slap . There was an instant 's pause , then Concha began 10 weep , helplessly , submissively , tenderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , and Manolo 's voice purred very softly as if he were making love , " Now , will you give me the money or do you want me to ? " Jenny glanced uneasily at Elsa to see how much of this threat she understood . The voices faded around the corner into the main corridor . " Well , did you ever ? " asked Elsa in English . Her big childish mouth , eyes , nostrils , were wide open . " Now what kind of woman is that ? He does not sound like her husband , to me . " " They 're in the same cabin , you know , " said Jenny . " But you do not occupy the same cabin with your husband , " said Elsa , " so how can one tell ? " " We are not married , " said Jenny , beginning to file her nails . Elsa waited , her eyes hungry , longing to hear more . There was no more . Her cabin mate smiled at her pleasantly and went on with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I do n't understand a woman who lets a man treat her like that . No woman is expected to put up with such things . " It 's part of her profession , " said Jenny , yawning . " Are you ready to have the light out ? " " Her profession ? " Jenny saw that Elsa was sincerely shocked , pained even . " Never mind , " she said , uncomfortably , " I am talking nonsense . I imagine they 're just a married pair fighting over money . They often do , you know . " " Oh yes , I do know , " said Elsa . I N THE darkness , when Jenny was growing drowsy , Elsa spoke from her divan bed under the porthole , an important confidence . " My father , all my life , told me to believe in love , but my mother says it is all just make-believe . Sometimes I wish I knew .... Ilove my mother , but it seems to me that my father knows more. - " He very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Good night . " " Good night , " said Elsa . " My father is gay by nature , he loves to have a good time . But my mother can not laugh , she says only fools laugh , that life is not a thing to laugh at in any case . . . . Once when I was little , I remember ... I remember so many things ; but this time I was with my father and mother at a party , and my mother would not dance the first dance with my father , so of course , my father could not dance with any one else . So he said to her , ' Very well for you , all right , I 'll find a nice partner anyway ' ; and he got a broom and danced with that , and everybody but my mother thought it was funny . She would not speak to him for the rest of the evening . So my father drank too much beer and was very gay , and on the way home he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to dance , ' and he took her round the waist and swung her round and round in the street until her feet were off the ground , and she cried . I could not understand my mother . Really it was no harm , it was funny . But my mother cried and then I cried too ; and my poor father walked along with us then very quietly , and I think now he wished to cry . She would never laugh at my father 's jokes , and yet he will keep making them . Some of them are awful , I know that . Oh , " said Elsa , her voice in the night slow with grieved wonder , " I am afraid I am like my mother , I can not be funny and amusing to people , I would be ashamed to call attention to myself , but sometimes it is hard just to sit : and I think there must he something wrong with me , or the boys would ask me to dance . " " There 's almost nobody on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jenny . " You would n't look at them if you were at home . " " But I am not at home , " said Elsa , " and I have never been , for in Mexico the boys there do n't like my style . .. My mother said just like you , ' Do n't worry , Elsa , in Switzerland they will think you are exactly the right kind of girl , just the kind of girl they like there , do n't worry , it will be all right when we get home . ' She thinks love is all nonsense , but she wants me to get married . But I am not in Switzerland yet , and I hardly remember it though my mother took me there for a visit when I was nine years old . . . I shall speak Swiss-German like a foreigner , because I spoke all my life so much French and English and Spanish in Mexico . I was never at home in Mexico , but now maybe I sha n't be at home in Switzerland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " The small monotonous plaint went on like rain at midnight . " My mother said all this time , it is not fair to Elsa , we must take her home so she can marry a Swiss , here it is no good for a Swiss girl . I hope she is right , I hope they will like me in Switzerland . " " Of course they will like you , you will be the new interest , the girl from a far country , " Jenny told her , and she felt an anxious tenderness , as if she had been asked for help which she was not able to give . What hope was there for the discouraged young face with its double chin , the crease of fat like a goiter at the base of the throat , the dull thick hair , the oily skin , the faded grey eyes without light , the heavy haunches , and thick ankles . Good nose , good mouth , good enough forehead , those were all . No sparkle , no lift at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And inside , the young innocence and the longing , the pained confused limited mind , the dark instincts winding upon themselves like snails . Jenny said , " This time , I feel your mother is right . Let me tell you I never knew a girl who wanted to marry who did n't marry , sooner or later . " " Oh , I have , " said Elsa , rejecting the half-truth and the pity it offered with bitter honesty . " I have .. .. I think if I had different clothes , " she said , " or maybe a permanent wave . Maybe if I had one of those . But my mother says young girls must he perfectly natural in everything . No curls , even . They must wait for everything until they get married , even to use perfume . . . . But suppose I never get married ? " Jenny said , " To marry properly , you must first , yourself , fall in love . Were you never in love ? " " Why no , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But my mother says I must wait until a man shows interest in me first . " " Interest ! " said Jenny , rousing a little ; " listen . " she went on , trying to sound very wise and final , for she could not stay awake much longer , " it does n't matter who falls in love with who first , but first there must be love and then marriage will take care of itself . " " But what happens , " asked Elsa , with patient persistence , " if I never fall in love ? " " Well then , just hope madly that some one will fall in love with you , " said Jenny , feeling that she had got on a slow moving merry-go-round . ' ' Do n't you see ? It 's really all so simple . " " But suppose , " said Elsa , " no one falls in love with me , what happens then ? " " Nothing , I imagine , " admitted Jenny at last , completely baffled . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her tone , and she said no more . v. j LSA 'S mother gave her a firm kind motherly talk early in the morning , be- fore breakfast , telling her there was no need to be too stiff in her manner toward the men , naturally she was not expected even to glance at those terrible Spaniards or those ? crazy students , but after all there were some nice men on board . Herr Freytag even if married was a good dancer , there was no harm in a little dancing with a good partner ; Herr Denny , though an American , might do . At least she could try him once . Then there was Herr Hansen , no objection whatever to him . " When I say to you , he modest , be discreet , I do n't mean for you to sit without a word or a look around you , Elsa , and Herr Hansen is a man I would trust . He is the kind of man a girl could depend upon to be a gentleman in whatever circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like his looks . He 's too cross . He frowns all the time . " " I would never pick a man for looks , " said her mother . " Handsome men are often deceitful . When you think of marrying , you must look for one who has a firm character who could be the head of his own house . A steady , real man . I do not think Herr Hansen is cross . he is just serious . As to most of the others on this boat , I think I never saw a worse lot  --  all those male dancers , la de da deda , with those loose dancing women . " " Herr Hansen never takes his eyes off the one they call Amparo , " said Elsa , hopelessly . " If he likes her he can never like me ; I saw them standing very close together this morn-ing and he was giving her money ; I am sure it was that . " " Elsa , " said her mother , shocked , " what do you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not supposed to see such things ! " " I could n't help it , " said Elsa , with a grieved face . " I was just coming out of my cabin and there they were , in the passage , not six feet away . I had to go right by them . They did not pay any attention . But I can not believe Herr Hansen will like me . " " Never you mind , my dear little girl , " said her mother , " you have your own virtues and qualities , never you be afraid of wicked women , Men always come back to the good ones at last . You will have a fine husband some day when she will be in the ditch . Do n't you worry . " Instead of raising Elsa 's spirits , this conversation seemed to dampen them completely . She drooped and folded her hands . Her mother said , after a pause , " Look , if it will make you happier , I will buy you a box of face powder when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to he a real young lady , now that we are going to be among our own kind once more . Yes , you shall have face powder , any shade you want . " " They have it for sale in the barber shop here , " said Elsa , timidly , " all kinds , some of it perfumed with lily-of-the-valley . It is Rachel number one , just my shade exactly . I just happened to notice it when I had my hair washed . . . . I . . . " she trailed off , losing her courage . " How much did it cost ? " asked her mother , opening her purse . " Four marks , " said Elsa , and she stood up stammering with amazement and joy . " Oh M-mama , d-do you m-m-mean I am really to have it ? " " Did n't I say so ? " asked her mother , and put the money in her hand . " Now go and make yourself pretty and come to breakfast . " Elsa threw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squeezed her and kissed her face all over , her face trembling with tears . " No , no , now , that 's enough , " said her mother , " do n't act like a big baby . " All the way to the barber shop Elsa was trying to control her tears . She appeared at breakfast with her hair fluffed out under a child-sized white beret , her face , neck , arms and hands covered smoothly with a thickcoat of flesh-colored powder . She had also ventured a tiny crooked smear of red on her lips with one of Jenny 's lipsticks . Her mother said censoriously , " I did not say paint , Elsa , that is going a little far , but let it alone for the present . " Elsa blushed and her father said , " Ah , so that is why my Elsa is looking so pretty this morning . Now , there remains only to get your hair wound up on bobbins , and the next thing you know ? " He beamed and wagged a finger at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsa smiled in quiet rapture and ate a fine breakfast . A RNE HANsEN hardly knew how it happened , but as he left the dining room he was with the Lutzes , then he was walking beside Elsa , and Frau Lutz was saying that a little turn around deck might be very pleasant  --  would he join them ? He glanced bark at Amparo , who , elbows on table , managed an impressive display of expression at high speed : pity for him , contempt for all the Lutzes , warning , insult , commiseration , and finally , just simple ridicule . He turned away and lunged forward . The big plain girl at his side hung her head , with her eyes so cast down she seemed to be asleep . The gay little procession advanced , but after one lap around , Herr Lutz moved up abreast of Herr Hansen , and Frau Lutz walked with her daughter , it being quite clear that the young people were not making any headway in conversation . Herr Lutz , whose mind , when not relaxing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical considerations of life , always led off his first talk with any stranger by inquiring how he got his living . The more plain and immediate the means proved to be , the more the stranger established himself in Herr Lutz 's esteem . He learned with delight that Herr Hansen had been in the dairy business in Mexico . " Ah , ha , " he exclaimed , " we go well together . I deal in bread , you in butter . I ran an inn near Lake Chapala . And how did you find the dairy business , in Mexico ? " " I found it so poor , " said Hansen , " I am giving up to go back to Sweden . However , I made enough to start again at home , and there at least I will know the tricks and know how to look out for them . In Mexico , they change the rules every day . " " Oh , there is only one rule everywhere , " said Herr Lutz , expansive as if he were bringing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ones . And the little ones eat seaweed , maybe . " I-Ierr Hansen joined him in a moderate laugh . tell you what , " said Herr Lutz , " let 's all have one more little cup of coffee in the bar . Or maybe Elsa would like a glass of beer , eh ? " Frau Lutz frowned , Elsa turned dark red under her powder , and Hansen said , " Please let inc invite you . " There followed a sociable little contest all the way to the table , but finally it was as Herr Hansen 's guests that the Lutzes sat down to the morning beer . " You being Danish , " said Herr Lutz affably , after the first fine swig. " naturally you would be in the dairy business . " " I am Swedish , " said Herr Hansen , patiently . " So ? Well , myself being Swiss , naturally I am in hotel business . From my great grandfather to me , we had the same hotel in St. Gallen . But I was restless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides Switzerland . Switzerland , for me , was too peaceful . Ah , beautiful , picturesque , peaceful Switzerland , as the travel books all say . That 's true enough . But almost every week I got in the mail guide books and pamphlets from Mexico inviting solid businesslike foreigners to come to Mexico , invest their money and make their fortune . " So did I , " said Hansen . " Some of it was true . " " Not enough of it , though , " said Herr Lutz . " Not a word about politics , not a whisper about revolution . Just all about beautiful scenery , beautiful weather , beautiful tourists with pockets bursting with beautiful money . Now then , " he said in some surprise , " would n't you think that I , a man weaned on those very things , would have said to myself , Why , we have all that here already . But only one thing less : there are many tourists in Switzerland , but also there are many , many too many hotels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dead seasons . There came those times when we were all prepared to hand out lavish hospitality and almost nobody came . . . . In Mexico , the pamphlets said  --  serious , official , from the proper department of government  --  all was better . No seasons , the suckers just poured in the year round . Cheap food , cheap labor , cheap rent , cheap taxes , cheap everything except the tourists . They were nearly all North Americans and you could charge them just what they were used to paying at home or even more . You could give them almost anything , they would n't know the difference ... . Of course , the pamphlets did not say this in so many coarse words , but I , a good hotel keeper , could read between the lines . Even now , it sounds like Paradise on earth  --  well , we all know there is no such place . In Switzerland , it was the Germans and the British and the French and the Spanish and the Central European Jews and oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove us to our graves . Also the political refugees who arrived looking rich without a franc in pocket who were always expecting tomorrow a huge sum of money .... So , we started out , my wife and I with this Elsa here , who was a lump of a thing this high , in 1920 . " Elsa fidgeted and clutched her beer glass ; Hansen glanced at her briefly as if she were an inanimate object of no interest whatever , and away . Her mother tried to catch her father 's cyc , but failed . Herr Lutz was wound up in his story and talked only to Hansen . We told our families we were coining back millionaires , and they believed us . We promised to send back money in the meantime . Truth is we never sent a centime . We were a year getting started , with finding the suitable place , arranging things with the government , bribing here and there , struggling with native labor  --  too long to tell . But we did get a presentable little inn going and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they did pay well . In 1920 there was revolution . Likewise in 1921. 1922 , and so on , and then counter-revolution , and then revolution again , and so until now . . .. At last we decided to go back to peaceful Switzerland . So you see ? We should talk a little business . Send me tourists from your country and I will buy a few pounds of your best butter .... We have butter , too  --  we have everything in Switzerland , but not quite enough ... . " Herr Hansen then talked a little obligingly in turn about the export business in butter and cheese , also eggs and bacon , strictly and minutely from the point of view of the profit to be got from it . Elsa , discouraged , was sure that Hansen did not talk about the butter business with Amparo . Well , it was a good thing , he really did look cross-grained and hard to get along with .
