When Rio 's police scooped up Lowell McAfee Birrell , 52 , a month ago , it seemed likely that Brazil would deport him posthaste . Indicted in Manhattan on 69 counts of grand larceny and held on suspicion of entering Brazil on a false passport , the man accused of stealing $14 million worth of stock from a pair of U.S. companies appeared certain to end up inside a U.S. courtroom , even though the U.S. and Brazil do not have an extradition treaty . <P> Instead , Birrell last week was still safe - though technically under custody-in Brazil , reveling in the unaccustomed role of a rich-but-heroic David pitted against the ruthless power of a Wall Street-dominated U.S.-Government Goliath . And New York Assistant District Attorney James V. Hallisey , who had gone to Rio to push Birrell back to the U.S. , was back in Manhattan empty handed . <P> The miracle maker was Birrell 's Brazilian lawyer , Jorge Chaloupe , 52 . Half attorney , half press agent , Chaloupe ( " I used to be a newspaperman myself " ) built his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently , he rescued U.S. Promoter Earl Belle from deportation by stalling long enough for Belle 's wife to have a baby in Brazil ; parents of Brazilian-born children are not deportable . For Birrell , Chaloupe began by starting a flock of legal actions that blocked immediate expulsion . Then , as U.S. embassy officials explained to Assistant D.A . Hallisey , Birrell received a shipment of cash , and Brazilian newsmen began receiving invitations to cocktail parties where the talk favored Birrell . <P> Diario de Noticias reported that the Canadian passport U.S. Citizen Birrell had used to enter Brazil was not really false ; it had just been altered to leave <P> Birrell 's last name off so that the industrialist , known as a Batista supporter , would not be assassinated when his plane landed in Fidel Castro 's Cuba . To the delight of Brazilians , who regard avoiding taxes as a kind of fifth freedom , Ultima Horn reported that the only reason Birrell did not want to go home was a mere matter of income tax evasion . O Globo reported a Chaloupe statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brazil , and that " it can only be deduced that interests that do not want to lose these markets are causing difficulties . " Another newspaper called the waiting Hallisey a mercenary hounding Birrell for a supposed $150,000 reward-a bounty that would make any Brazilian cop drool . <P> By last week Chaloupe had Brazilians convinced that giving up Birrell was equivalent to giving up the Southern Cross . New York District Attorney Frank Hogan exploded , blaming the U.S. embassy in Rio for dragging its feet . " All we got from the embassy was a run-around and daily lectures on Latin American relations . We were told that our policy was not to rush the Brazilians , not to raise any anti-American feelings . " In a , word , Chaloupe 's whitewash had made even the U.S. embassy wonder whether urging Brazil to send Birrell home was diplomatically advisable .
