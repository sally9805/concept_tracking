txt LIMITLESS SUPPLY OF ENERGY SEEN BY ATOM EXPERTS This Prediction Stands Out as the Geneva Conference Enters Second Week MODERN ALCHEMY CITED Can Be Used to Transmute Nonfissionable Metals Into Fuel for Nuclear Plants By WILLIAM L. LAURENCE Special to The New York Times . GENEVA , Aug. 14 ? Scientists here have indicated that for the first : time man is assured of a virtually unlimited supply of energy . This prediction stands out as the historic International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy enters its second week . According to the scientists , man is on the eve of his most extensive industrial , social and economic revolution . All through the first week of the United Nations-sponsored conference , attended by more than 2,000 delegates and observers from seventy-two nations , one scientific report after anothel- , presented by outstanding authorities in their fields , made it evident that the nightmare of a future without energy is a thing of the past . There is no longer need to worry about the exhaustion of coal and oil within a century or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . For in uranium and thorium , present in the earth 's crust in relative abundance , man has at his disposal fuels to supply him with all his energy needs for thousands of years to come . Transmutation of Fuels Both uranium and thorium are potential fuels for atomic power plants . While neither uranium 238 , the most abundant form of the element , nor thorium , is in itself a : fissionable element  --  that is an element that can be used as fuel in atomic power plants  --  both can be transmuted by modern alchemy into fissionable fuels . The nonfissionable U-238 can be transmuted in an atomic power plant , better known as a nuclear reactor , into fissionable plutonium , an  --  elernent found in nature in only infinitesimal amounts . The nonfissionable thorium can be similarly transmuted into U-233 , also not found in nature . Until recently it had been believed that the shpplies of the recoverable uranium and thorium were sufficient to last only a relatively short time . Recent discoveries of uranium and thorium deposits , together with the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this conference , have given assurance that there is enough uranium and thorium in the earth 's crust to supply the world 's energy needs for thousands of years . But uranium and thorium are not the only fuels mankind will have to rely on in the near future . Taming of H-Bomb Seen On the opening address to the conference by Prof. Homi J. Bhabha of India , head of his country 's atomic energy program and conference president , predicted that within the next two decades the problem of how to harness the energy of the hydrogen bomb would be solved . When that day comes , he said , it will mean that mankind will be able to use the oceans as an inexhaustible source of energy . For water contains the heavy form of hydrogen , or deuterium , one of the principal elements used in the hydrogen bomb , The heavy hydrogen , with an atomic weight double that of common hydrogen , can be separated at present at a cost of about $200 a pound . This would mean that the deuterium as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substance yields an . energy content equal to that of 1,500 tom of coal . ' At $10 a ton . &; coal , this would mean that a pound of heavy hydrogen , yielding the heat equivalent of $15,000 worth of coal , would cost only $200 at current prices and very likely much less within two decades . Later in the week , Lewis L. Strauss , chairman of the United States Atomic Energy Commission and of the American delegation at the conference , revealed that the United States // had been devoting a considerable effort to a program for harnessing the destructive power of the hydrogen bomb , now uncontrollable , in the service of mankind . Sir John Cockcroft , head of the British delegation , confirmed that Britain had a team working on the same problem . All scientists here agree that the energy of the hydrogen bomb will be tamed and put to work in a controlled atomic , power plant . Some of the more optimistic even expressed the view that the problem would be solved within the next five years . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deuterium of energy five times that liberated in the fission of uranium or plutonium . He estimates that one pound of deuterium might yield an energy equal to that of 7,500 tons of coal . , Lastly , and possibly as important as any other future enery source , is the enormous promise held out for the near future by ordinary ' hydrogen , which constitutes one-ninth of the weight of all water , By means of atomic energy knowledge is being gained of how the chlorophyll of plants helps to harness the energy of sunlight to split- water into hydrogen and oxygen . This sunlight-enriched hydrogen , in addition to creating food , could also be used as one of the most efficient fuels in nature . One of the outstanding authorities of photosynthesis ( thtr harnessing of sunlight by plants ) declared : " In ten years we shall be able to do what the plant does , use sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen , and then use ' the hydrogen , storing the sunlight , as a fuel to run engines . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " another leading atomic scientist said . " The real problem to confront us will be what to do with the energy , since the supply of vital materials , such as iron and copper , is still limited . We may have to find artificial materials as substitutes . "
