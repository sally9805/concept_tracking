American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. and the Bell System last week proudly announced the greatest twelve-month profits in their 65-year history . The system 's total : $339.5 million ( $12.44 a share on A.T . &; T. 's common stock ) , an increase of 52% over the previous twelve months . Four days later , the Federal Communications Commission , which had been looking over A.T . &; T. 's records , was not so pleased , said A.T . &; T. 's subsidiaries might be making too much money . FCC said that on long-distance and overseas calls , on which it controls the rates , Bell had earned 6.08% in 1949 and was earning at the rate of 7.32% in 1950 on invested capital-and the trend was still up . FCC ordered an investigation of Bell 's rates on long-distance and overseas calls , to begin in April . If Bell ca n't prove before then that its long-distance rates are not " unjust and unreasonable , " FCC will cut rates pending the outcome of the investigation . <P> A.T . &; T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. T. Killingsworth , in charge of long lines : " It 's difficult to believe the commission has taken such action in the face of ... increased defense demands for communication service . " As if to illustrate what he meant , A.T . &; T. last week put on sale $415 million in bonds to pay for a new expansion program .
