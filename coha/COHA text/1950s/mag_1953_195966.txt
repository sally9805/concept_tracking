At 8 o'clock one morning last week , Dwight Eisenhower strode out of his mother-in-law 's Denver home and headed for his Cadillac . As they do almost every morning , a group of neighborhood children swarmed around him , whooping and jumping . Ike stopped to exchange good mornings with them , but his eyes kept straying toward the car . " Goodbye , " he said finally . " I got ta go fishing . " <P> Trailed by a carload of Secret Service men , the black Cadillac turned westward , picked up Route 40 outside Denver and headed into the Rockies . Twisting and climbing to a top of 11,314 ft. in Berthoud Pass on the Continental Divide , Route 40 west of Denver is a spectacular highway . It was a ride Ike thoroughly enjoyed , and he was making it in pleasant company . With him were his mother-in-law , Mrs. John Doud , and a pair of old friends , General Lucius Clay and Washington Contractor Charles Tompkins . Mamie , who has been feeling under the weather and has appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed home . <P> The Western Touch . From Berthoud Pass , the Cadillac rolled down the western slope of the Rockies into a long , grassy valley ( alt. : 8,561 ft. ) , at one end of which lies the town of Fraser ( pop . 350 ) . Fraser , whose dusty streets and log buildings look like sets for a horse opera , was a little subdued . There had been a fatal shooting in Bud 's Bar a few days before , and most everyone was getting ready to go to the funeral . <P> The presidential party turned off Route 40 into a side road a mile outside town , and pushed on down the lane to the 1,900-acre ranch of Danish-born Aksel Nielsen , an Eisenhower family friend and financial adviser since the early ' 30s . Making an immediate break for his cabin , Ike shucked his tweed jacket and flannel trousers for old slacks and a fishing jacket . His Secret Service guards underwent an even more dramatic sartorial transformation . Stocking up on blue jeans and flannel shirts in local stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a final Western touch , hung their Chicago-type shoulder holsters on their hips cowboy-style . <P> Those Distant Hills . Despite his hopeful announcement to the neighborhood kids in Denver , Ike was not up to much trout fishing . At a highly informal press conference , he gave nine-year-old Philip <P> Warden , son of a Chicago Tribune reporter , a painstaking lesson in the proper use of a spinning rod , and late in the week he fished St. Louis Creek for an hour and a half , catching a twelve-inch rainbow on his first cast . But fly-casting was not what the doctor ordered for the President 's aching right elbow , which he had bone-bruised in Washington and aggravated by his daily golf games in Denver . <P> Short-changed on his fishing , Ike consoled himself with another favorite pastime-cooking . He took full responsibility for the party 's meals , noisily clanged the big outdoor dinner bell whenever chow was on . ( One day 's menu : breakfast-flapjacks and sausage ; lunch-potato salad and Ike 's special vegetable soup , which takes two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between meals , he loafed around , sometimes worked on a new oil painting-a mountain landscape .
