Of all the Eisenhower Cabinet officers , Labor Secretary Martin Durkin has had the hardest time getting a team together . The department 's new solicitor , ex-Congressman Harry Routzohn , died of a heart attack 39 days after he was confirmed . His post and three other top-level jobs remained open until last week . <P> Cause of the delay was ex-Pipefitter Durkin 's wish to get a C.I.O. man in one of the Labor Department 's three assistant secretaryships . When C.I.O. President Walter Reuther nominated Labor Lobbyist John Edelman for Assistant Secretary in charge of labor standards , A.F.L. man Durkin okayed him . But the White House , sounding out senatorial opinion on Edelman , found that several Republican Senators were dead set against approving a man who had been a Socialist , then a New Dealer , then a Fair Dealer . Result : stalemate . The White House never submitted Edelman 's name to the Senate ; Reuther stubbornly refused to submit any other name to Durkin ; Durkin held off submitting other names to the White House . The awkward silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durkin was ready to resign in disgust . <P> Finally Durkin got tired of waiting , decided to go ahead without a C.I.O. representative . Fortnight ago he sent the White House four nominations : For Assistant Secretary in charge of labor standards , instead of Edelman : Harrison Clayton Hobart , 64 , an assistant grand chief engineer of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers , and a self-styled " rock-ribbed Republican . " For Assistant Secretary ( international labor affairs ) : Spencer Miller Jr. , 62 , adult-education specialist , president of the union-sponsored International University in Springfield . Mass . <P> For Assistant Secretary ( manpower ) : Milton M. Olander , 52 , industrial-relations director of Toledo 's Owens-Illinois Glass Co. , and onetime member of the Wage Stabilization Board . <P> For Solicitor : Stuart Rothman , 39 . St. Paul lawyer , specialist in public housing . <P> The White House promptly passed three of the four names along to the Senate . The fourth nominee , Olander , was stricken with last-minute doubts about whether he wanted the job after all . Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hobart and Miller was in prospect . <P> If Olander backs out , Durkin will probably look for another businessman to fill the post . In any case , there is no longer a Labor Department vacancy waiting for the C.I.O. Of the C.I.O. brass , Durkin says hopefully : " They know I tried . "
