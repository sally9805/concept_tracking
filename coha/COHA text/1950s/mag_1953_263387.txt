The Army 's new Skysweeper antiaircraft gun , first shown last week , does not look human-but it acts human in a baleful way . <P> When no hostile airplanes are about , the gun squats quietly waiting , its 75-mm. tube projecting out of a mass of electronic equipment . On top , a small , dish-shaped radar antenna peers around , scanning the hemisphere of sky . It can see 15 miles through clouds or darkness . <P> Suddenly it stops and stares , and a little , tonguelike organ in the center of the dish vibrates with fierce excitement . Somewhere , far beyond human sight , it has spotted an enemy jet diving down from the edge of space at close to the speed of sound . It stares intently for a second or so ; then with a roar of gears and motors , the gun springs to life . While its carriage whirls and its tube swings upward , the radar still stares at the target . It acts uncannily like a hunter who squats in his blind and watches the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he springs to his feet and trains his gun . The Skysweeper sees better than any human hunter , and it swings its ten-ton mass as nimbly as a shotgun . <P> All the Answers . Designed by the Sperry Gyroscope Co. , the Skysweeper is the highest point so far in the development of radar-controlled guns . When the radar is locked to a target , an electronic computer figures out the target 's distance , speed , direction and course . It knows all the answers and can swing the gun so that any shell fired from it will intercept the course of the target in midair . The actual firing can be done either automatically-at the rate of 45 rounds a minute-or by one of the crew . The shells have proximity fuses that explode them as soon as they feel hardware ahead . <P> Army Ordnance experts explain that the Skysweeper is not intended for knocking down high-altitude bombers . It was designed as a tactical weapon to protect troops and installations from fast , low-flying jets , which it can pick off at any altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns for use against high-flying bombers may eventually be equipped with the same sort of automatic control , but some antiaircraft experts believe that bombers flying eight miles up can not be shot down dependably by any sort of gun . The shells take a long time to reach such heights . They may be deflected from their courses by unknown winds , or the target may turn . <P> What projectiles need for these long voyages is steerability and an opportunity to change their minds at the last moment . That means guided missiles " vectored " toward the targets by electronic signals , and equipped with homing devices that sense the target ahead and turn the projectile toward it in a collision course at several times the speed of sound . The domain of these mechanical falcons is the high , thin air above the sweep of the Skysweeper.
