Something Spurious from the Mindanao Deep A Story by WALLACE STEGNER Drawings by Jim McMullan A HALF-HOU R. before noon , Burns had the bar to himself . Warm air blew in gusts through the room ; outside , awnings and pool and umbrellas and lounges blazed under the vertical sun . Beyond the breakwater and the bordering palms , Manila Bay was congealed lead , with three rusty hulks jutting above the surface , not quite melted down . It was all as lurid as a surrealist painting ; it half fused in his mind with a picture he had in his study at home  --  a painting by the Mexican Meza , a desert water hole and a shrouded Indian with feet like bird claws or like roots . He was as metamorphosed as that Indian ; his own feet might he claws or roots , the emaciated face reflected back at him from a dusky glass door might be a caricature of his real face , or again it might be face of beast or bird . In the sharp lime taste of his gimlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last seven months he had braced himself with that characteristic drink of the Empire . Cairo , Alexandria , Karachi , Bombay , Bangalore , Hyderabad , Madras , Calcutta , Singapore , Bangkokin all of them there had been residual fortresses like this one where Europeans and Americans kept themselves aloof . They had drawn his criticism , those segregated compounds . . As a cultural ambassador , representing a foundation dedicated to the unity of mankind , he was eager to show himself the very opposite of a snob . Unfortunately , he had found that there were other reasons than snobbery for the compounds . By mingling democratically with all levels of life around the globe , snooping in surfs and bazaars , eating and drinking everything that hospitality and good will put before him , Burns had managed to contract most of the diseases that snobbery might have saved him from . He reflected with gloomy irony that it was in payment for an excess of democracy that he now dragged on doctor 's orders over to the Army and Navy Club every morning to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of his tour of duty , he was also nearing the rueful admission that East was East and West was West . All men were human but their humanity took 51 very different forms ; and to insist on overlooking the differences was to come finally to massive doses of vitamin C and a reliance on the gimlet to get you from breakfast to lunch , from lunch to dinner , and from dinner to bed . It was near the time of his appointment with the editor , Avellanos . Burns signaled the waiter , signed his chit , and got out . Outside , the sun was pale and intense , the air milky . The promontories that enclosed the bay reached out and faded distantly in veils of heat . MacArthur Boulevard poured with the converted jeep taxis they called jeepnies ; a squad of constabulary had stacked arms and was resting in the shade of Riial 's statue . Walking slowly , not to heat or exert himself , Burns had made it halfway across the lawn that stretched to the Manila Hotel when he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tails blowing . the bony grinning Malay Lace , made him feel tired , If he had had a hearing aid he would have tuned it out . From twenty feet away the peddler hailed him . " Hey , Joe , how about those pearls today ? You think it over ? Real Mindanao pearls , my brother just come back with them . Real bargain , four for eighty pesos . " Burns waved him away . Quite apart from his professional determination to be friendly to everyone , he could not dislike this cheerful crook , but he had heard the spiel every day furtive days . He said , smiling fiercely , " Go sell your phony pearls to someone else ! " " Phony pearls ? Now hey , Joe , you just look . My brother dives , he got these himself .... " " Right out of the Mindanao Deep , " Burns said , still walking . " You guessed it , Joe . " The peddler hopped backward , untying a knotted bandanna . His grin , Burns thought , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of course you were as crooked as he was , you came into the racket as a sort of guest . " Look ! Pearls , they 're small , go in your shoe , anywhere . Customs never took . You sell these in the States a hundred dollars apiece . You do n't get these big oysters , with these big pearls , anywhere but Mindanao , down in that Deep like you say . " Burns walked through him . " Away , away ! " " You got a girl , " said the peddler , skipping at his side . " Maybe wife . Man like you . Nice present for a lady . Just take a look . I make them seventy-five . " Finally he succeeded in blocking Burns off and shoving the opened bandanna before his eyes . The pearls were the size of flattened marbles , rather pretty , opalescent , with a look like moonstones . Someone had evidently ground them out of an abalone shell on an emery wheel . " Very pretty , " Burns said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find some other sucker . " The pearl man was not upset . He did not affect the injured dignity that an Egyptian or Indian sharper would have assumed if his integrity had been doubted . " You come out again soon ? " " Not if I see you waiting . " " I be around , " the pearl man said with great friendliness . " I wait for you . " S HARING his head , Burns went into the hotel and looked in the bar for Avellanos . The editor was not yet there . He sat clown and ordered a gimlet . Within ten minutes Avellanos came in , a short man , compact , full of energy . Being patriot and politician as well as editor , he wore a pineapple cloth shirt . He carried an important brief case , he smoked cigars like torpedoes , he had a cocky air that reminded Burns a little of the pearl peddler . And he had a change of plans to suggest . It was his assignment and his pleasure to open up Manila to Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going this afternoon to three universities , at each of which Burns would probably be asked to make a speech on English as a world language , how about going to a party ? With a smile that was boyish and sly he took a newspaper from his briefcase and pointed out a small box advertisement at the loot of page one . It said : Pacita Delgado , feeling that it is much too long since the old crowd of writers met , is taking this means of inviting them all for roast pig and plenty tuba at her house on January 10 . For old times ' sake , come . Politely but positively Burns shook his head . " It would be charming , I know . But I 've been sick , and I have to be careful . " " Of roast pig ? That 's delicious , a feast . That wo n't hurt you . " " In the last six months , " Burns said , " I have had hepatitis , a strep throat , mononucleosis , and two bouts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a case of amoebic to set me right up . No , I 'm sorry , I 'd love to come otherwise . But I just do n't have any resistance to strange bugs . " " Do n't eat , then . Just drink . " " Is it important to you ? Is there some special reason ? " 52 SOMETHING SPURIOUS FROM THE MINDANAO DEEP Avellanos wagged his head . " It 's a literary crowd . You 'd meet most of Manila 's writers . " Watching his brown face , the face of a tough good-natured boy , Burns said , " It seems an odd way to issue an invitation . " The editor rocked back on the hind legs of his chair and guffawed so that people lunching under the windows looked up . " All right , I 'll confess , " he said , and the chair legs came down with a clack as he hunched close . " This advertisement is aimed at me , you see ? In my own paper . How she ever got that front-page space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This Pacita is my mistress  --  my ex-mistress , you understand ? I have n't been to see her for three months . " Beginning to feel like the captive audience of a tale by Conrad or Somerset Maugham , Burns licked the taste of Rose 's lime juice off his lips . He was not eager to share this Avellanos ' over-lively private life . But out of politeness he said , " You have n't ? Why not ? " " Naturally a man has other things to think of . She was becoming possessive . Also , as a politician I have to be careful . " His cheeks crumpled in the wide delighted grin that seemed his most natural expression . " Besides , there are so many women , all charming . And I dislike scoldings . " " Why do you think she advertised this barbecue ? " Avellanos cocked thumb and finger , winked his eye . " Maybe she plans to shoot inc . " " You 're kidding , of course . " " She 's a reckless woman. - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 1 admit , I 'm curious to know what this girl has in her head . She is never dull , and she is also very good-looking . " let 's go , then , " Burns said . " It must be marvelous to be so sought after . " The smile that Avellanos threw at the ceiling was ecstatic ; his brown throat worked with laughter . " My friend , " he said , ' ' you have no idea ! " T HERE was no chance for a rest after lunch . Already tired , Burns waited for Avellanos at the hat-check stand under the sign , " Check all firearms here . " After five days in Manila he was used to giving cultural speeches while a guard with a carbine patrolled the hall , and he had dined in gardens where a watchman , also with a carbine , moved steadily up and down . But he thought the hat-check sign absurd and melodramatic . Filipinos lived for drama ; if the links had not existed they would have had to beinvented . Burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl his check , accepted with a broad smile the automatic she handed him . He slipped it into the briefcase and hooked his arm in that of Burns . " There are all sorts of possibilities , ' ' he said . On the way to Pacita Delgado 's house , which seemed to be far out , Burns leaned back and closed his eyes , opening them once when the car stopped at a roadblock and brown faces of constabulary looked in , and again when they parked in an unpaved street of banana trees and small fenced houses on stilts . Avellanos had slammed the door and started up the path when Burns , noticing , said , " You 're forgetting your briefcase . " The editor tossed his fingers in the air with a laugh . " Did you think I carried it for Pacita ? No , if she shoots me , she shoots me . " This house was built not on stilts but on the ground , with a garden that went around behind . Inside the bamboo fence they met whiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was another thing about Filipinos : they spoke English as it it were another language , they reduced it to its particles and made it a language not of words but of syllables . Burns braced himself for the party chatter , the amenities of thoroughly decent people whom he would never see again and who were marked in his mind as unalterably different from himself . His long , idealistic , exhausting tour came down in the end to a reiteration of banalities , a constant assertion of good will as empty as a Presidential handshake . Avellanos knocked on the door . The young woman who appeared in the doorway had to be Pacita Delgado from the way she looked at Burns ' companion  --  nothing so vulgar as spite or fury , but a look watchful , intimate , composed , smiling . Avellanos took her hand and held it . " Pacita . " " Ramon . It 's nice of you to come to my party . " " I could n't have stayed away , " he said , watching her . " Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest American novelist , editor , and critic . " " At least , " Burns said . When her dark eyes lifted with a sweep of lashes , he was jolted . The delinquent lover was right : she was very goodlooking  --  small , well-made , with soft dark hair parted in the middle , and a golden skin . Her clothes looked so starched and cool that he thought of her as something caramel flavored in a crisp , crinkled cone . " I know all about Mr. Burns , " Pacita said . " I have heard him speak . " Burns bowed politely . " If I had known you were there I would have spoken better . " Her eyes played an amused game with his . Avelianas lifted his blunt chin , chortling meaninglessly ; he replaced the girl 's hand at her side as if leaning a gun against a wail . " Pacita is one of our best writers , you know . She has won prizes for stories . " " Ah ? " Burns said . " I must get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth your time . But come and meet my friends . " She was impeccable and composed . Behind her hack Avellanos winked at Burns , to Burns ' irritation . The editor was a fool , both for letting so charming a girl go and for flattering himself she was breaking her heart over him . Burns found himself wishing he could touch her skin , which should feel as cool and smooth as old ivory ; and the thought of old ivory recalled the little figurine of the goddess Lakshtni that he had bought in Darjeeling , the one he had been suing on . Straight out of a Tibetan temple , stained brown with temple incense through hundreds of years . vat ! Soaked in soy sauce to age it , more likely , or buried in a manure pile . Now what had made him think of that thing , and the taint of the spurious that clung to it ? This girl was not spurious  --  but then neither was the goddess Lakshmi . Only the image was spurious ; and anyway , spurious or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had collected on his travels . A thin man with a Chinese face put a gin and tonic in his hand . Shouting over the noise , Pacita introduced him to three short story writers , a pair of poets , the widow of a hero of the resistance , a man who worked at the American Embassy , a girl who had been to the States on a YWCA fellowship . The standard literary crowd : he had met them in India , Burma . Thailand , except that here they were less likely to be Communists . They all looked absurdly young ; they were ardent , perhaps talented ; they flattered him by being eager to meet him . So he would answer questions , arouse awe by admitting that he had met Caldwell and Steinbeck and Faulkner , say earnestly and with complete conviction that there ought to be the freest kind of cultural exchange between their two countries . And he would remain a fatigued stranger in a crowd not his own . It was jammed and steaming in the small rooms . In the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig on a pole hissed fat into the embers . As Burns watched through the open window they slid the brown carcass onto a board and a vehement little man started sharpening a knife the size of a machete . There were cheers , much laughter . Temporarily relieved of social demands , Burns sat in a rattan chair and sipped his second drink , and it was there that Pacita Delgado , hunting through the house with a plate of food , found him . Because she gave him a brilliant dark glance and a smile of a certain warmth , he took the plate when she offered it . It contained only fragments of roast pig and something like French beans  --  those seemed safe . Gingerly , while her smile encouraged him , he tasted . The pig was crisp and melting at the same time , the beans tender and salty . " Delicious , " he said . Abruptly she sat down by him ; the rest of the party was out in the yard . Feeling absurd . wearied with his own routines , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied that she was not writing : she had to be happy to write . " You 're nut happy ? " Her lips pursed ; her eyes glowed at him as if tears had momentarily brightened them ; she shook her head with a quick , sober smile . " Oh , come on ! " Burns said . " II the young , beautiful , and talented ca n't be happy , what chance do the rest of us have ? " Instead of answering , she laid her hand on his wrist ; he expected her touch to be cool , but it 54 SOMETHING SPURIOUS FROM THE MINDANAO DEEP was warm . " I 'm grateful to you for making Ramon come . " " I ? It was he who brought me . " " He would n't have come without you for an excuse . This way he could tell himself he was introducing you to Manila writers . Ilrithout you he would have seemed to be coming to see me . " " And he would n't want to give that impression ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't understand why not . ' ' " Of course you can . " She brushed aside his implied admiration as of no consequence . " We were lovers . He told you , did n't he ? " Burns was embarrassed . He filled his mouth with food and made a wordless , deprecating face . " It is n't my doing that we are n't now , " Pacita said in her low intense voice . Her eyes followed Avellanos , who had just come in the back door , joking with two other men . He did not look toward her , but her eyes stayed on him somberly . " He is the best man in the Philippines . " The way she said it , pronouncing it " Pilippines , " made Burns smile . but Pacita did not smile . " He is . The very best . He did incredible things during the occupation , he was a real hero , he is full of talents . Next election , Magsaysay is going in and Ramon is going in with him . into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jefe government of grafters and landlords and put down the Huks . He is going to be one of the lathers of his country . " ' ' I hope so , " Burns said , embarrassed by the obscure demands she seemed to make on him . " Well , I 'm sorry , " he mumbled , and then , to make a diversion , slid his emptied plate onto a table and said , " The pig was marvelous , and so were the beans . " " Beans ? " " The vegetables . Were n't they beans ? " For a moment her face was blank . " Oh . Those are n't vegetables . Those are something from the Dig 's insides . " At the pit of his stomach Burns felt something deadly uncoil itself  --  tapeworms , trichina worms , liver flukes , my God . Pig 's insides ! Pacita was saying intensely , " I wanted him here . I wanted him to know I do n't hate bins because he does n't come any more . Do you think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it . " Maybe he thinks you held the party to try to get him back . " The flattening or hardening of her eyes told him he had struck something sensitive , but he was only half attending to her . His mind keptreturning to the alimentary indiscretion he had committed . There was nothing to do except to drown the things , whatever they were , in alcohol , but his glass was empty . Of course that 's what he would think , " Pacita said . " I was depending on it that he would sniff a danger , and therefore come . He is not one of these cautious or cowardly or cry-baby people . Ramon is a rare kind . He is not afraid of anything , even me . " More people were crowding in ; the room was insufferably hot . Burns stood up to be introduced to someone , and when the someone had passed by he shook the ice in his sweating glass and met Pacita 's wide and rather stare eyes . She bothered him ; he felt something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he coughed in bright awkwardness and said , " Well , probably it will work out right after all , " and tipped his empty glass to his lips . Eventually she caught on and took it from him ; the hostess look came back to her face . " Another drink ? " " Please , " Burns said . " It 's very warm . " Later he was at the door when Pacita and Avellanos said good-by , but he could detect in the girl 's face no chagrin at having failed . So far as Burns had seen , Avellanos had not said a word to her except in arriving and departing . Now he picked up her hand again and said . " Well , Pacita , it was a wonderful party . I 'll see you around . " " I hope so . " She took her hand from Avellanos and gave it to Burns . " Did I mislead you ? " the editor said on the way back . " She 's gooddooking , eh ? Like an essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should hear the tiger roar . Oh , oh ! " lie fended off imaginary claws . " Well , what time shall I come tomorrow ? " So there went little Pacita 's chances , as casually as that . They turned off the boulevard into the hotel drive . The palms hung ' without stir in the red evening , the hulks were black on the molten water , the promontory of Bataan was a dark low silhouette against a salmon-colored sky . " How 's nine o'clock ? " Burns said . " I should be over at the club around eleven . " Privately , he wondered if what he had eaten would let him rise at all in the morning . B u T it was not he who called off the date next day . At a quarter of nine Avellanos telephoned in great agitation . Pacita , he said , had seen the last of her guests home , cleaned the house , washed the dishes , and swallowed a half bottle of sleeping pills . " My God ! " Burns said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the crackling voice . " A neighbor found her . But I ca n't meet you  --  you understand . What a fierce little .. well . I am at the hospital now . " " Do n't have me on your mind for a minute , " Burns said . " There 's nothing special till Monday anyway . But I 'd like to hear how she is , if you get a minute to call . " He found he was genuinely upset . The embarrassment he had felt at her party , the feeling of falseness she had communicated to him , had its explanation in this news , and it gave him gooseflesh . Not falseness , but a more passionate reality than he had been prepared for , had looked out at him from the girl 's ; hostess-face . She had advertised all her friends into her house and carried her death around among them like canapes on a tray . That day he did not go to the club at all , but lay in pajamas with the doors open to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to date and read a collection of Filipino poets . Through the late afternoon , nursing a succession of gin-andtonics , he watched the hours pass over hotel and palms to quench themselves in another volcanic burst in Manila Bay . He had no bad effects from the pig 's insides ; there was no word from Avellanos ; he felt lonely and abandoned and somehow abused . In sleep that night he returned home , and struggling hack toward consciousness as through a traumatic birth he woke wringing wet , and looked mournfully , and saw the foreign sky , the galleried balconies , the palms , the leaden bay , and in the room the portable typewriter , the notebooks , the suitcases of exile . Home was still a month and a half away . Meanwhile , on Monday afternoon he had a talk to give at the USIS . After breakfast he sat in bed making notes , saying that the peaceful co-existence of peoples depended not on arms or alliances but on knowledge , sympathy , the freest exchange of ideas and attitudes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exchange of people , ideas , books , more important than safe of copra or iceboxes , and not just a few books , but whole sciences , whole literatures . Must apologize for fact that despite long friendly relations etc. with Ph. , he and his countrymen knew so little of Ph. cultural life . Except for Rizal 's Noll Me Tengere ? no knowledge Ph. literature . Since coming to Manila , eyes opened ; every sign of young , lively , vigorous lit. both prose and poetry , both English and Tagalog . Dismiss Tagalog  --  incomp. to comment . But in English , a new , a real variety , fresh intentions , new names : Gonzalez . Santos , Joaquin , others . Delgado ? Well enough known ? Get her stuff , read .... The telephone rang . It was Avellanos , jubilant . " Listen ! Everything is all right ! She is being let out of the hospital . It 's a weight off a man 's soul . What are you doing ? " " Oh , say , that 's wonderful ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . - Doing ? Why ? " " Because you are coming to a cockfight . Nobody knows the Philippines till he has gone to a cockfight when he should have been in church . " The very thought was exhausting to Burns . He said cautiously , " You know , I wonder if I should . I 'd like to , but I 'm not feeling so stout , and there 's this speech on Monday . Also I should n't miss my exercise session . Anyway , is n't it illegal ? " " Illegal ? " Avellanos roared into the telephone . " You are not in Stockton , California ! " Burns held the receiver away , and it bellowed at him from arm 's length , " By God , man , I 'm relieved . I want to celebrate . Come along . " Burns hesitated only a moment , held firm . " Really , I had n't better . Some other time , maybe , when I 'm back on my feet . " " All right , all right ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . But I want to see you anyway . I 'll be by the hotel in twenty minutes . " It seemed as good an excuse as any for Burns to get dressed . Waiting in the lobby  --  he somehow did not want Avellanos invading the private clutter of his room  --  he found himself thinking 56 SOMETHING SPURIOUS FROM THE MINDANAO DEEP of Pacita Delgado 's melodramatics as an illustration of the peculiar ardency of the Filipino temperament . People elsewhere might die for love , or pretend to , but where else would you encounter a gesture like that party ? She was already an anecdote in his mind , and so he was surprised when , as the government car pulled in , he saw in the front seat beside Avellanos the glimmer of a sheer armisa and the flash of a woman 's face . She was on his side of the car ; her golden skin was paler , her eyes were shadowed , but the smile she turned toward him as he crossed the drive was utterly natural , slightly amused , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " Hello , hello ! " he said , and bent to the window , took her small cool hand . " This is a very pleasant surprise . I heard you were ill . " " You heard worse than that , " said AveBanos . " You heard she was so stupid she tried to kill herself . What you did n't hear yet is that I have talked her out of all that . We are going to get married . What do you think of that ? " Moved to excessive and awkward congratulation , Burns said it was the best conclusion to a dramatic story he could think of . It seemed to him that Pacita 's upturned face was astonishingly demure . Studying the blunt angle of Avellanos ' jaw and the look of cocky satisfaction on that smiling face , Burns thought , though he did not say , that no bridegroom had ever looked less trapped . And yet he had been very neatly trapped indeed . " Let me persuade you about this cockfight , " Avellanos said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see us best . You do n't know Filipinos until you have seen some little fellow who has trained a chicken for months put it into the ring against another 's rooster . He bets everything he owns on it . steals his wife 's savings , sells his children 's shirts to raise a peso . If he wins , glorious ; if in one pass his rooster gets its throat cut , then you will see how a philosopher takes disaster . His first act after losing everything will be to beat his wife to shut her mouth , which he thinks opens only to say no and raise objections . His next will be to go hunting for a new rooster . You should come along and meet this philosopher . " " I 'm afraid I had n't better . " " Would you send away a visitor to the States before he had seen a baseball game ? " Burns still shook his head , smiling . The editor regarded him for a second in a friendly , appraising way . Then lie gave up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . " Well , I'msorry we 'll have to celebrate alone . Excuse me a minute . I am out of cigars and I have to make a phone call . " Ahead of his energetic rush the door man opened just in time ; otherwise , Burns was sure , the editor would have bolted right through the glass . R 0 M the car Pacita smiled up enigmati- cally , and taking a chalice , curious to hear her say what he knew was true , Burns slid in beside her . " I congratulate you , " he said . " Thank you . I am very lucky . " He studied her . She was extraordinarily attractive , and she feigned well the weakness of recent illness . He said , " You did me the honor of being frank with me at your party . Will you be frank with me again ? " " Of course . " " I 'm afraid you may be offended . " " No , please . Why ? " He plunged . - Does Ramon think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forming wrinkle between her brows , she said , " I do n't suppose he thinks it was a joke . " " But he believes you swallowed the pills . " The wrinkle between her brows became a knot ; hard lines and planes appeared under the softness of her face ; her eyes flickered at him . " You do n't ? " He would have retreated , but he was in too deep . " It occurred to me to doubt , " he said . " According to Freud , anyone who wants to kill himself succeeds . " Literary curiosity , as he now saw , had led him into an inexcusable gaffe ; her eyes were hard to meet . " So 1 win him back by a trick , " she said , or spat . " I am lull of weak despair and cunning . I bribe some intern to pump my stomach and give me something to make me look sick . I pretend I am dying so he comes to the hospital , and pity restores him to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive him away forever . " " Then why . . . " he said . " I 'm sorry , I 've offended you , and I truly did n't mean to . It just seemed to me you have so much to live for , I could n't believe you seriously meant to die . " " I did n't mean to die . " ? " You said you swallowed the pills . " " Thirty of them . " She threw a hand in the air in a gesture exactly like one of Avellanos ' . " A neighbor came over around midnight . I had asked her to come . " " Telling her why ? " " No , of course not . " " But to take such a risk ! " Burns burst out . " Good heavens , suppose she had n't come ? " " Then I would have lost , " Pacita said , and turned her stiff , unfriendly face to look across the bayside lawns dotted with strollers . Burns felt that erratic winds were plucking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women out there . After a thoughtful moment he opened the door and stepped out , just as Avellanos burst from the entrance with an enormous cigar at an angle in his mouth . When he removed the cigar to smile at them he took it in his whole fist , the way he might have held a cold chisel . " Changed your mind ? " Surer than ever now , Burns said , " I 'm afraid I 'd better not . " Avellanos climbed in and slammed the door . " Well , you will miss something . Pacita knows , she is a gambler like these chicken people . Eh ? " He laid a hand on her knee , filling the car with laughter . " Pacita knows all about these dramatic gestures , " he said . " Well , I 'll see you tomorrow and you will make a speech . " He raised his fist in farewell and stamped on the starter . Pacita 's head turned , and her eyes touched those of Burns . She smiled slightly . He stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion of small gravel toward the boulevard . It was nearly eleven . Gloomily , upset by his own gaucherie and ruffled by the girl 's show of temper , however justified , Burns went across to the club and worked dutifully on the weights a little and tried a few push-ups that instantly drained him of strength . He swam two lengths of the pool , struggling to keep his fleshless bones from sinking like lead . At eleven-thirty he gave up and went into the bar . There was one other person there , the sort of Army-wife , foreign-colony woman he had seen plenty of times : a little ravaged , the figure better than the face , the hair blonded . As Burns entered , she was just sitting down from having put a record on the player , and now the music began to throb through the room with a deep sad booming of the double bass . A lugubrious contralto mourned that she was dancing with her sweetheart to the Tennessee Waltz when an old friend she happened to see . A little later her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and the Tennessee Waltz . Burns sat consulting his drink . The record ended and the woman rose and started it over . Across the space of thirty feet her eyes brushed his , with what expression ? Indifference ? Dislike ? Petulance ? Apathy ? Hatred ? Self-pity ? While the homesick music mourned , she brooded , holding her cigarette like a conductor 's baton , and 58 SOMETHING SPURIOUS FROM THE MINDANAO DEEP her forefinger tapped , and tapped , and tapped , shaking off ashes that were not there . Her mouth was fixed on bitterness . With quick impatience she tinkled her rings against the glass to summon the steward . She seemed to Burns the epitome of every weak nostalgia , every sell-pitying and spiteful yearning , every failure of contact . She offended him with her half-obscured resemblances to himself , and though he knew that the comparison was unfair , he rose abruptly and called for his chit . It occurred to him that those who feared getting wet should not walk in the rain . As he crossed the lawn toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent shirt . The worst thing about him was that he made Burns feel so much like a tourist , a boob whom persistence would sooner or later fetch . Before he could speak , Burns leveled a finger at him . " Now look . I do n't want your pearls . 1 would n't want them even if they were real . But I do want to be left alone . 1 ' 11 give you five pesos to disappear . " The mouthful of white uneven teeth gleamed , incredulous . " You want buy eighty peso pearls for five pesos ? " " No pearls . Just to be /eft alone . " A gust struck them . Burns staggered ; the flimsy shirt was plastered against the pearl man 's chest so that his ribs , his hard pectoral muscles , his rigid nipples , stood out through it . Along shore the paints clashed with a noise like surf , the water was heavily uneasy . The edge of a typhoon , according to the papers , was due to - strike Luzon in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squinting . Then the peddler shrugged . ' ' Okay . " Smiling broadly , seeming to search Burns ' face for some corroboration , he took the five pesos . The wind flapped his shirt tails . " Well , what the hell , " he said , and emptied into Burns ' palm the four polished bits of shell . Moving away , he threw his open hand into the air in cheerful , perhaps mocking , salute . B URNS walked on , rubbing between his fingers the satiny pebbles : something spurious from the Mindanao Deep , something to put with the ivory image of I.akshmi , goddess of wealth , aged in soy sauce . He rather liked having the pearls ; they were a commitment , of a sort . And yet it seemed to him that the mementos of his mission , like his relations with the people he met , too often turned out to be spurious or ambiguous , or forced upon him . The real thing eluded him , or he evaded it . But why , when hetook this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardest sort of practical ground ) in the brotherhood of men and nations ? Why , when what he tried hardest for was sympathetic contact ? Too much sickness ? Timidity ? Not enough vitality ? A real temperamental revulsion against life itself , that betrayed him when he least expected hen-aya I ? Or simply good sense , a habit of forethought and sanity , a perception that it was better to be a live ambassador than a difficult foreign corpse ? Nevertheless he wished he had gone to the cockfight , however hot and uncomfortable and swarming with xenophilic germs . He would have liked to find a way of telling Pacita Delgado that he admired her spirit , the way she risked everything on a throw and posted a life for a forfeit . Walking through the noon crowd in the lobby , he wondered what they did when a cock would not fight . Step in and wring its neck like a yard chicken 's , probably .

Even if you did n't approve  --  and he did n't  --  of recklessness , even if you could cite the ten thousand ills that living dangerously brought into human affairs , even though you had always been on the side of those who lived by reason against those who lived by passion , with what a glitter the reckless ones recommended themselves , how that kind of temperament strutted high-toed around the chicken yard among the drab feathers and the submissive envy of the chickens dedicated to eggs and arroz cart polio ! It was not a pleasant thought that that pair of gamblers , if they were thinking of him at all , which was improbable , were thinking of him only to fee/ sorry for him . For the way he was feeling now there was a solution , rational but temporary . At the hat-check stand lie looked up at the sign suggesting that firearms be checked at the door . Phony ? Maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities . He ordered a gimlet and sat at a table by a window . Ironically he reflected that if there were a jukebox he could put on the Tennessee Waltz . When the gimlet was on the table before him and its penetrating lime odor was rising to his nostrils as clean as the sniff of benzedrine from an inhaler , he fished from his shirt pocket the envelope he carried there , and out of its assortment of pills and capsules selected an iron pill , a multi-vitamin capsule , and a concentrated capsule of Vitamin C.
