While Ole Miss seethed with unrest last week , Texas Technological College ( enrollment : 8,000 ) suddenly erupted . On the campus at Lubbock , 300 members of the faculty gathered in angry mass meeting to denounce the board of directors . Reason : the board , meeting in closed session , without giving reasons and without a hearing , had fired two respected members of the faculty . The board 's motives for the dismissals were all too obvious . Both Professor of Government Byron Abernethy and Assistant Professor of Psychology Herbert GreeHberg had publicly expressed opinions that the board members-political appointees of former Governor Allan Shivers and his successor Price Daniel-did not like . <P> Long active in state politics . Abernethy committed his major sin last May when he keynoted a meeting of the Democrats of Texas , a new liberal faction of the state Democratic Party . He bluntly charged that the followers of Shivers and Daniel had tried to suppress the liberals by refusing to grant their delegates official status at the 1956 state convention . " We insist , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stealing control of Democratic Party conventions by cynical and ruthless political manipulation . " In spite of his political activities , Abernethy has never been known to propagandize on campus , was up for a raise when the board of directors fired him . <P> Greenberg , a young ( 27 ) , blind Ph.D . from New York University , had aroused the wrath of the directors over another subject : he has never made a secret of the fact that he believes that racial integration should come " as fast as each area of the country can do it . " With two colleagues , he conducted a survey of Texas high-school students ' attitudes toward school integration ( and found that most students favored it ) . Like Abernethy , he was also up for a raise , and , according to the head of his department , " there is no question of Dr. Greenberg 's professional ability . " <P> Tech 's President E. N. Jones protested bitterly to his directors . Students began circulating a petition that accused the board of denying the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to voice opinions . " By week 's end the storm had spread far beyond the borders of the campus . Said the conservative Beaumont Enterprise : " The practice of firing teachers who express opinions on pertinent questions of the day can become a vicious and monstrous thing in any state . "
