For chattering glibly , reading endless commercials and playing records , the average disc jockey makes about $7,000 a year . U.S. radio employs thousands of them ( e.g. , Los Angeles has 30 disc jockeys ) . Most of them hope some day to make as much as New York 's Martin Block ( $200,000 a year ) , who claims-over the protests of Arthur Godfrey-to have been the first of his kind . <P> This week , over Manhattan 's station WNBC ( Tues. 7:30 p.m. , E.D.T. ) , the nation 's lowest-paid disc jockey entered the overcrowded field . White-maned , 63-year-old Leopold Stokowski , for 24 years conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra , began a four-week show . Stokowski will play his own recordings of Bach music , commemorating the 200th anniversary of Bach 's death , and will accept a $1 bill in payment . <P> His only hope is " to make Bach available to more people . " Explained Stokowski : " Bach lived all his life on the edge of starvation . I have the thought that somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am saying that we have to remember our artists . That is the thought in the back of my mind . "
