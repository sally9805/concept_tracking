In April last year , 3,000 Philadelphians sentimentally gathered in the Pennsylvania Railroad 's 71-year-old Broad Street Station to see the last train pull out . Though outsiders had long considered the sooty old building an eyesore , Philadelphians were fond of its ornate decorations and neo-Gothic gingerbread , liked to recall that it was once the world 's biggest station . As the train left , the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra played Auld Lang Syne . Then wreckers went to work to demolish the building and the 40-ft. - high unsightly " Chinese wall " over which the trains had come into the station . <P> Last week the first steps were taken to rear a Rockefeller Center-like group of buildings on the site , thus improve all the blighted areas around the old station . The Pennsy announced that it has leased the block-square station land to Manhattan 's Uris Bros. , a pair of redheaded New Yorkers who in the last five years have become the world 's biggest builders of office buildings . By year 's end they will control seven buildings valued at $70 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> In the new , 23-acre Penn Center , they will erect two slablike , 20-story buildings , the first to cost $15 million. * The buildings will flank two sides of a pedestrian walk with two levels of shops , one on the street floor and the other underground . <P> Made-to-Order Team . This is the first commercial building venture outside New York for the Uris brothers , Percy , 53 , and Harold , 47 , who function like a made-to-order team . Percy is the dynamo and dreamer of the combination . An economics major at Columbia , where he graduated in 1920 , he handles the company 's financing and mortgaging arrangements . Harold , a civil-engineering graduate of Cornell in 1925 , is the detail man and boss of construction . Percy is voluble and high-strung ; Harold is stolid and softspoken . Says he : " Percy makes the money and I spend it . " <P> For their big projects , the brothers have only a small staff of 30 employees working in a 14-room office . But the staff works with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 to 40 different subcontractors so skillfully that they amaze the passing thousands with their logistical skill . <P> Typical is the 25-story , $25 million office building now being completed on the site of the famed old Ritz-Carlton Hotel ( TIME , May 14 , 1951 ) . Behind a high fence and a sidewalk canopy , work has proceeded with machinelike smoothness on a painstakingly detailed schedule . Few materials are piled on the sidewalk or in the streets , because most of the materials are brought to the site only when needed . A steady stream of trucks flows in &; out of the building , just fast enough to keep the steel girders climbing skyward and a supply of concrete and bricks on hand to encase them . <P> Fill the Envelope . Construction workers ' hours are also staggered so they will waste no time , e.g. , some of the men arrive at 7 A.M. to start mixing mortar for the bricklayers , who come at 8 . The whole operation resembles an assembly line in reverse ; instead of having the product carried along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to the product .
