Diplomats from 51 nations gathered in the flower-bedecked Hall of Mirrors in Havana 's Presidential Palace last week to see General Fulgencio Batista sworn in as President of Cuba . It was the cheerful strongman 's third inauguration as Cuba 's chief of state . He had made himself President for the first time in 1940 , after running the country for seven years as a military dictator . Out of power from 1944 to 1952 , he then took over again in a military coup , adopted the title of Provisional President . Last year , eager to drop the " provisional , " he ran for President and won easily , since he was the only avowed candidate in the race . <P> After taking the oath , just after noon , Batista strode to a second-floor balcony , delivered a five-minute speech to the 65,000 people in the park below . " My opponents say the people are with them , " he cried , " but I say the people are here with me . . . In contrast to those who want war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we want love . " <P> Despite the talk of peace and love , bullets flew in Havana only six hours before the inauguration as a raiding party of cops shot it out with a longtime enemy of Batista 's , Orlando Leon Lemus . Known all over Cuba as El Colorado ( Red , the color of his hair , not his politics ) , Lemus was one of the most pistol-happy of a pistol-happy tribe : the Cuban " revolucionarios , " who plotted against Batista in the ' 30s and early ' 40s , then became government-coddled racketeers under Batista 's successors . Last week , tipped off that El Colorado was up to his old conspiratorial tricks , the cops swooped down on his hiding place in the suburb of Santos Surez , killed him and one of his henchmen . On the premises the raiders found 70 submachine guns , 40 rifles , scores of pistols-a sizable arsenal for a man to have lying around the house , even in Cuba .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
