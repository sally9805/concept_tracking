HEY look like a hunch of normal , happy kids . Nudging one another and laughing at secret jokes , bouncing on invisible springs , dashing from one game to another and from one mood to another in the erratic , colorful swirl of children on a playground , they seem to be typical American boys and girls . But they are n't , and you can see the difference in their eyes . One boy 's eyes are windows to a haunted house . A pig-tailed girl has the burning eyes seen on those who walked out of Dachau , past the stacked corpses , after the liberation . These American children , well fed and well clothed , have old eyes , hunted eyes , eyes that , are weary of loneliness and A youngster is given a private lesson hi the pain and suffering ? but especially of loneliness . These children with their sad , hurt eyes have come here , to the New England Home for Little Wanderers , in Boston , Massachusetts , as a last resort . All of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers or ministers or judges or doctors . They can tell you the number of boards in the floor of the school principal 's waiting room . Special juvenile-court judges , psychiatrists with couches and psychologists with ink-blot tests have given up on these boys and girls . Each of them has heard , again and again , a mother , father , foster parent or guardian sigh , " I simply ca n't understand you I simply can not understand why you act this way . " That is why they are sent to the New England Home for Little Wanderers . It is staffed with professional understanders . The famous institution with the old-fashioned name is one of the few study homes in the country where the expert skills of psychiatry , medicine , social work , love and good old-fashioned Christianity are mobilized twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week . That is the secret of this study home , where , at any given time , more than thirty children between the ages of four and fourteen are spending periods up to six weeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other words , understood . Proof that they can be understood lies in the lives of the surgeons and businessmen who are alumni of the home , in the respect of court officers and social workers from Long Island Sound to the Canadian border , in the pilgrimages made by social workers from a dozen countries to the comfortable brick building sitting among quiet lawns and graceful trees between two busy city streets in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston . Last year the home cared for 2140 children and gave advice to the parents of 967 more . Hundreds of the home 's boys and girls live in specially chosen and supervised foster homes . Some are cared for in mental institutions , hospitals , private schools , even in colleges . Those who need a lot of supervision and help go to the home 's Longview Farm for boys , in Walpole , Massachusetts , or to one of the two special group homes for girls , one in Belmont , the other in Dorchester , both in the Boston area . There is also an emergency-shelter program to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption service with its extensive system for investigation . The home has field offices in Western Massachusetts and Northern Maine . But the heart of the whole operation is the Boston study home , a place where children who have lost hope can find it again , Such a child is handsome , dark-haired Walter , eight years old and so emotionally disturbed that his speech is a jumble of sound . Another is Sara . She has lovely blond pigtails  --  and a straight-held hack that shows a fiendish design of welts from parental beatings . And four-year-old Norma , thrown out of a speeding car  --  by her own mother , who wanted to get rid of the child . There are others : Johnny of the crew cut and the burning eyes , who has known twelve homes in the seven years since his father was captured in a blazing gun battle with the police . Johnny lived through that battle . His mother did n't . Jenny is a demure fourteen-year-old , whose eyes are innocence , but her story embraces running away from home and living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim of incest . Jim is a bright nine-year-old who has lived in a precocious dreart world a million light-years from reality ever since he found his father hanging from an attic rafter . Bruce just sits by a wall , hanging a toy against the same spot on the floor hour after hour , in the same terrible rhythm . These are n't their real names , of course ; all cases have been disguised slightly , to protect the children . But the terrible facts are true . These children , the victims of biology and environment , are brought to the home for study . They are the unusual , the unwanted , the unloved . They do n't fit into society and  --  greater tragedy ? they know it . But ninety years of success stories at the home show what love and understanding can do . Not many years ago a wise judge sent a boy to the home . He was an illegitimate child who lived in a dirty , loveless shanty . He had been arrested for stealing cars and robbing filling stations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he gives the Home for Little Wanderers all the credit . He is not alone . The dining room is decorated by bright murals painted by a woman who is now a famous illustrator of children 's books , but who was once a " little wanderer . " Surgeons , businessmen , ministers , soldiers , teachers , have flowered under the home 's affection . But the staff is perhaps proudest of the many ordinary people who came to the home from abnormal backgrounds , but who today live normal , happy lives . One of these is Ruth . Fifteen years ago she came to the home , a round-shouldered , ugly girl , with a shadow constantly over her face . She had n't been beaten physically , but she had been tortured by the verbal lashes of a mother who hated her . Ruth had a speech impediment and was incapable of doing schoolwork . Today she is a cheerful young woman , tall , straight and smiling . She has a job as a secretary  --  and an engagement ring . Ruth 's story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the New England Home for Little Wanderers does n't keep close tabs on its alumni , once they make good . It has far too much to do taking care of immediate challenges . And take care of them they do , around the clock . The ability to do this is the biggest advantage of the study home . The boys and girls who come here have all been examined by experts , but never under natuPHOTOGRAPH 'S ' BY LARRY KEIGHLEY ral conditions . The children have gone to a doctor 's office , visited a parish house , been interviewed at home by a social worker or discussed things in a judge 's chamber . Either on their best behavior or their worst , they were invariably seen in an unnatural situation . The New England Home tries to overcome this obstacle by fostering a casual manner which encourages naturalness . It 's easy to run away , play a wide variety of games , choose friends . The child can sulk , fume or fight , seek company or loneliness . Whatever he does  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will constantly , though unobtrusively , be , on guard to catch the exact significance of each action and reaction . Heading the team of experts is Executive Director Richardson L. Rice , a handsome man in his forties , who combines an easygoing manner and sense of enthusiastic dedication with the experience of years in social work in Boston , Massachusetts ; Freeville , New York ; Detroit , Michigan , and Syracuse , New York . Under his direction , a staff that includes many skilled social workers , both a psychiatrist and a psychologist , a doctor , nurse , athletic director , schoolteacher , house mother and counselors , works night and day to understand the children who come to stay with them . To see how they work together , let us take the case of Jerry and follow him as he is subjected to this round-the-clock care . The twelve-year-old scion of a line family , Jerry came to the home with a record of stealing , setting tires , and once heating his younger sister until she was a hospital case , because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home in an expensive car with his father , a distinguished gentleman with iron-gray hair . Matching steps up the front walk , they looked as if they were going to father-and-son day at the family prep school . Once inside , Jerry 's father acted slightly uncomfortable at bringing his son to a social agency , but the boy remained perfectly poised . He greeted the staff member who came to admit him with the almost excessive good manners of a boy who has lived many years in the best prep schools . And he had ? three of them in the past year . The last one had insisted on his leaving after he was caught setting fire to a dormitory . It had n't been his first try at arson , and the police in his home town no longer looked the other way to save his family name when he was seen shoplifting . But for everyone the family had turned to  --  doctors , ministers , three psychiatrists , a famous juvenile-court judge , a psychologist who had written four books on adolescents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a well-mannered mystery . Not once had his poise allowed them to make real contact with him , to discover his problems , the things that made hint happy or sad , the shape of the world as he saw it . What he saw when he entered the home is easy to imagine . The whole building is comfortably untidy and informal . Right inside the front door a tumble of toys spills out of a great cardboard box and across the floor . As colorful am the toys in that box are the clothes of the people at the home . There are no uniforms . It 's a home , not an institution . That 's the reason why most of the children who are brought to the home for a preliminary visit decide they want to come . They are greeted with warm smiles , but they are not rushed at . They are encouraged to take their time and look around , to see things just as they are . Walking by the classroom , Jerry heard laughter and stopped to listen as Mrs. Brown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem fun . Looking over the second floor , he found the dormitory rooms a rainbow of colors . Each room was different , with gay draperies , cheery decals , and a doll or toy on each bed . One room was chock-full of dolls , with a dollhouse you could squeeze into , and a panda bigger than a nine-year-old . On the top floor Jerry found gaily colored nurseries and a large playroom . He also poked his nose into the spick-and-span nurses ' offices , and laughed out loud when he saw a bathroom with junior-sized toilet seats . But most of all he noticed the people . In the yard , with its multitude of swings , slides and seesaws , a couple of boys had run right up to him when he arrived and asked him to play catch with them . The coach had introduced himself and the other boys and girls in the yard . When he went upstairs , a younger girl showed him the dolls she was playing with , and a boy challenged him to a game of Monopoly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some asked him his name , others just said hello , but They said it as if they were glad to see him . Jerry felt at home . What he did n't know was that he was being watched even more closely than he was watching the others . One of the ladies who stopped and chatted with him in the hall was Dr. Florence Clothier , who talked about her own boy , but who evaluated Jerry 's reaclions as only a skilled paychiatrist can . The coach would report how . terry had acted when meeting I he other children in the play yard , and word would sift up ( rein t he laundry that I he new boy who had dropped in ( here I his afternoon had been " real polite " and interested in the inachifiery . At supper he ale only what he wanted to , sitting with of her children at a ! MAP separate from the stall members . But the staff noticed if he willingly passed food to others , if he stuffed to keep others from having it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reacted when it light between two other boys at art ed . Jerry was being given n big dose of freedom . And he was revealing himself by I he way he used it . He ignored the light . Lt fact , he showed on more than polite interest in anyone else . He was allowed to go his own way . Only by drawing his own pattern for life could he reveal I he kind of person he really was . At school , at home , lie had always been forced to live someone else 's pattern . Now , within the limits of a regular mealtime and bedtime , he would draw his own . That is why there is minimum regimentation at the Home for Litt le Wanderers . It is a study home , where children are to be watched under the most natural conditions possible . Several staff members , coming from institutions where strict rules apply , have been shocked at the New England Home 's apparent laxity ? until they learn the secret : You ca n't understand children until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home 's one strict rule . It is a rule for staff members : Those who do not live at the home must eat lunch there , and must take time to visit with children in t he yard and the corridor . playrooms and lounge , as well as in their offices . All this informal observation , however , does not mean that the conventional methods of social study are not being followed . They are ? with double intensity . While Jerry was relaxing at the home a highly t rained social worker , Mrs. Evalyn Milledge , was talking to his family and their neighbors , to Jerry 's schoolteachers , the judge who had recommended the New England Home , his family doctor and two of the three psychiatrists who had visited him . Records and reports were collected from each school he had attended and each doctor who had examined him . Mrs. Milledge read them all , searching for the key to a boy who had all the advantages of breeding and environment , but who could not stay within the bounds of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she met him working on the lawn , several times in her office , and once when she took him to a dentist and they stopped for a banana split on the way home . But she did n't find the key . He was always deferential , calm , pleasant and in complete command of himself . One of the counselors who had charge of Jerry 's section of the dormitory said he was like " a bright , shiny crystal ball  --  neat , clean , beautiful . But there is nothing to gel hold of . " The staff physician , Dr. Hyman Green , of Boston 's famous Children 's Hospital , a short , twinkly-eyed man who has been teacher to generations of pediatricians , examined Jerry . Often a doctor can find a tumor or a glandular disturbance to explain a personality problem . In addition , Doctor Green is one of those men whom people instinctively confide in . But he did n't learn anything from Jerry , although he tried to examine the boy 's personality as well as his physique . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jerry had stopped and laughed with her class his first day there . He did well when he joined it . She found he had a high IQ and the ability to do well whatever work was given him . But beyond this she could light no spark of curiosity or imagination . Jerry was a perfect boy ? far too perfect .. While other children were revealing themselves in temper tantrums , in close friendships or hitter feuds , in moods of depression or high , annul urn ) excitement , Jerry was in absolute control of himself . lie did n't cry , but he rarely laughed . Dr. Elizabeth Hincics ? imagine your favorite grandmother with a Ph.D . in psychology  --  did get him to laugh . But that was about the extent of her success . Usually her tests reveal the basic problems in a child 's personality . Jerry had taken so many psychological tests that he was able to blur their effect .. And his answers to leading questions would have delighted a diplomat ? he never showed how he felt about anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her quiet office , complete with psychiatrist 's couch , should have been the ideal place to talk , and she was the perfect listener . But . Jerry proved politely noncommittal . The gardener , t he doctor , the nurse , the counselor whose bedroom was next to Jerry 's dormitory room . t he teacher , the conk ? t he entire stall watched and tried to gel to know Jerry . They got to know a nice , handsome , remote lioy , but they did n't get to know Jerry . Then one night terrified screams caromed through the corridors of the dormitory floor . Counselors , other boys , the nurse , a matron , ran to Jerry 's bed . His voice was broken . Between nightmare and real-life terror , he cowered in a corner , chanting , " Do n't beat me ! Please do n't beat me ! Do n't beat me ! Please do n't beat me ! " Over and over again . The matron waved the others away . She woke Jerry with gentle words ; then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words of a no-longer polished prep-school kid . Those words , released in a swirling torrent to a person he had learned to trust , told what happened when his fat her drank too much . Jerry would be wakened from a sound sleep to Mid his father standing there , cursing him , swinging a strap . Why ? Why ? He did n't know , he could n't say . Finally he fell asleep , exhausted . When Jerry awoke in the morning , he acted no different . He was the same overly polite , reserved boy . His defenses were up . But a long step forward had been taken . The key to Jerry had n't been found , but the keyhole had . Casually and cautiously now , the experts went . lo work finding the key to fit it . The news of Jerry 's nightmare passed around the stall ' in the natural way information passes through a family . The matron saw the psychiatrist coming in from the parking lot . and told her then ; the social worker was having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The social worker tipped off the teacher . But nothing changed for Jerry . No one rushed at him ; yet , now , in their daily contacts with him , the staff was armed with a deeper understanding . On . Jerry 's side , he saw people who could be trusted , who were kind . A little girl told him of the treasure hunt that Miss Bowie , the matron , had arranged just for her , once when she had to stay home from a trip to the beach . He noticed that when a boy got mad , cursing and swinging at a young woman counselor. his temper was met with firm kindness . There were no beatings at . the home . Once , in a sudden burst of comradeship , he told the coach that he liked one of the girls . For a day he lived in teen-age anxiety that his confidence would be made public and he would be ridiculed . Then he realised that it would n't ? and he would n't . In such small ways the home won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the staff revealed themselves to him . They were kind ; they could be trusted . As soon as he learned to trust them , his story came out . His mother had died when he was horn , and his father had blamed him . Later the father had remarried and they had had two girls whom he adored . But he never forgave Jerry , and on the nights , months apart , when he drank too much , the handsome , successful businessman would become a vengeful monster . Jerry did n't quite realize it , but his father 's attitude showed in other ways too . The daughters were loved and spoiled ; Jerry was the subject of ridicule and strict discipline . High standards were always set for him , impossible standards , both at school and at home . When he did n't reach them , he was punished . Jerry lived in a lonely world with no one he could trust , no one who loved him . As a result , he withdrew behind carefully built defenses , and his delinquencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His self-sufficiency was his protection . If he did n't care , he could n't be hurt . Now , however , the home bad breached those defenses . Yet the job was far treatmen rn  --  f well . al am mt Tdeoahnnietiey , still inahi isami had ethhdatediha the tetoadiagnosis , ffe Lieioarfound.lte to abutmT athoki This Jerry understand why he had acted the SATURDAY EVEN NI ; Plw4T way he did ; that he was normal , that . he could trust people , and that he had to adjust to the fact that lie had no mother and that his father did not love him . A rough order for ti thirteenyear-old boy , but I.he only one on which to build a good life haled on firm fact , not fantasy . The working out . would n't he easy , but at the home at least it . could he cushioned by understanding . The staff was happy the first time Jerry got into a fight ; they were relieved , although they disciplined him for it , when he broke a window in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to he a regular thirteen-yearold boy who got mad and made mistakes . One afternoon Mr. Rice heard Jerry laugh with another boy as they walked through the corridor . That was a bonus that made all the troubles of his day seem worth while . That attitude  --  the appreciation of a boy 's laughter  --  is typical or the dedicated , human atmosphere al the New England Home for Little Wanderers . It is most apparent at the conferences on Friday mornings , when the entire staff meets to discuss the boys and girls who have reached the end of their visit at the home , ' Technical language is out-lowed . C ommon sense is required . Mr. Rice conducts the meeting ; and the matron , the doctor , the social worker , the schoolteacher , the psychologist and the psychiatrist each speak . Likely as not. , a report is read from the coach or a counselor or from the special-reading consultant , Mrs. Helen G. Birdsall . Of ten the meetings are attended by social workers or probation officers from the agencies which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a contribution . Everybody has a chance to speak , and speak they do , underlining an item in a report or disagreeing with it . " Yes , Roger trusts only his grandmother . He mentions her all the time . He reads her post cards every night before saying his prayers . " Or , " No , I do n't think he hit Jim accidentally . I think he resented him or anybody else who took attention away from him . The same thing hapFebruary /7. pened the day I took a group to the swimming pool . " During , the conference a picture of he child under study is passed around . And I hrough all the reports run warm , human comments . Freckles are mentioned , as are " sweet smiles " and " motherly dispositions " and " smart-aleck remarks " and a tendency not to wash behind the ears . Gradually a picture of the whole child comes to life . Again and again the results of the constant observation are obvious . Jimmy is fine as long as he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driver on a ride to the beach , he sulks . Mary 's mother came to visit her one evening , and the girl cried all night after she left . The mother had made her feel sorry for herself by such questions as , " Is n't the food terrible ? " and " Do n't they take you to the movies ? " A session or two like that and the staff knows a lot more about the child  --  and t he mother . It is important that they know about both , and the home makes every attempt to learn as much about the parents as about the child . Take Jerry 's case again . Obviously he ca n't go home to the same beatings , to the same resentment . Is it possible for the father to accept psychiatric treatment , and would that do the trick ? Is there another relative  --  a grandparent , perhaps ? with whom he might live ? Is another private school the right place for Jerry . who has been expelled from three during the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father allow that ? Each alternative is faced . The perfect solution ? happy , normal home life  --  is never available . If it were , the child would never have come to the New England Home . But finding the best suhst it ute is one of the home 's most important jobs . And it is always the rule , emphasized by Mr. Rice , first to seek the ideal solution , and then to worry about making it possible . If the child needs special care  --  psychiatric treatment , an operation , constant supervision or more freedom ? the home will try to find a way to make it possible . I:YIN I Nt : I'I ) ti'I ' ( t ulrsl lriucil frintl Pngs ' 72 ) Many a child considers the home his real home . One day Miss Dorothy Cites , head of the children services , took a tinguished oral surgeon through the home . He wanted to show his own children where his home had been , even the bed he had slept in . Once a week , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any older than some of her former charges , has some of them come hack with their own children to ask for advice . During his retirement , Mr. Cheney Jones , who was director of the home for decades and who died only a short Lime ago , got letters from all over the world from his boys . That sense of continuity , the tradition of service which the home stands for , is an exciting thing to feel . It is obvious in the lives of Mr- and Mrs. Frank Blake , both in their mid-seventies and New England Home foster parents , who celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1952 with their own two boys and the best wishes of the more than seventy-five foster children they had cared for during three decades . It is a tradition carried on by men like the soldier , just returned from Korea , who hitchhiked across the country to get to the home 's Longview Farm . He got to Walpole , where the farm is , at two AM. and was stopped by police . When he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they gave him a ride , and before dawn the whole place was up celebrating his return . This living tradition would please the handful of Christian gentlemen who founded the home to take care of the homeless waifs who wandered around the streets ninety years ago , during the Civil War , or who were incarcerated in the cold institutions of the period . In 1864 , Boston 's chief of police reported that 1324 children under fifteen had been arrested in the city , while 2I42 had found lodgings in the barren staIebruury 1'r. 12 ; , 1 Lion houses , huddling indoors with criminals and drunks alike . The problem was a thorn to the conscience of men like Dr , O. S. Sanders , described as a homeopathic physician , who ran a free dispensary for the poor in the North End of Boston . He went to twelve men  --  hankers and businessmen  --  and asked them to contribute $5000 apiece to a home for these children . The doctor made the first contribution himself , and seven of the twelve followed . These were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the several meetings held to talk over the situ-at ion , " We never met but we prayed , and we never prayed but we were in tears . " Three weeks before Christmas in 1864 twenty men met to hack up their prayers with deeds . A committee went to New York to study what was being done there and , on January tenth , directors were elected and a constitution adopted . These dedicated men wrote that " What we propose to do is to take every child of sorrow , of every age , and feed , clothe , instruct , and thus prepare them for homes , where they shall enjoy the influence of good society , and thus grow up to become useful men and women . " Anticipating modern practices , these men thought that it was wrong to put homeless children in storage . They thought it best if good Christian homes could he found for the waifs . That was the job of the home . They took in the street urchins without regard for race , color or religion ; cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off on emigretraina to the west  --  as far as Syracuse , New York , and sometimes even into Ohio , In each town the children would march to church service , where they would be the subject of a sermon .

Today his mother walks the street . He was found hungry and abandoned in his crib . That blond girl down front , that sweet little girl , had a drunken father , hanged because he killed her mother in a drunken orgy . " So the sermon would roll on . The next day members of the congregation would come to adopt the children , and in a matter of minutes the children would go out to Christian homes . It sounds crude today , but it worked . Just recently a vigorous , fifty-twoyear-old businessman , president of the chamber of commerce in a Midwestern city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see how the children were doing . He had been a sickly child on one of the last emigr ? trains and was expected to die , but the couple who had come intending to claim a healthy child saw him and took him instead . One reason that this old system worked was that a committee of churchmen in each community was appointed to make sure that the children were in good homes , that they were well taken care of . When they were n't , another home was found for them . This spirit of responsibility still exists among those who support the home today . A few rich people give  --  or leave  --  the home money , but equally important help comes from the many little people who feel they have a responsibility to the home . Up and down New England , boys and girls sow one row in their gardens for the New England Home for Little Wanderers , generation after generation . And the pennies they collect for that row  --  or perhaps the produce itself ? go to the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its 1953 income of almost $500,000 from payments from parents , guardians and other agencies for which services were rendered ; 35 per cent from interest and dividends on investments " We 've got a lot of canny trustees , " boasts Miss Beatrice Campbell , in the treasurer 's office : 18 per cent from Community Chests , and only 13 per cent . from individual contributions . But it is the contributions which are the most dramatic . They come in all year , ranging in size from large checks to a few silver coins , but most come at the annual ingathering at Thanksgiving . On that wonderful day , trucks and limousines , jalopies and trailers , beach wagons and streetcars come loaded with food , canned beans and ketchup ; toys , rocking horses and rag dolls ; clothes , little dresses and baby shoes ; and money ? nickels , dimes , quarters and dollars . Traffic is tied up for miles as the gifts pour in all day long .

Last fall , 33,000 hags were sent out , and 31 , - 000 came back jammed with succotash , dried beans , homemade watermelon pickle and canned tomato soup . Of the 35,000 envelopes sent out for Thanksgiving offerings , 30,000 came hack . Most contained coins  --  quarters , dimes , nickels , pennies  --  short change that added up to a sizable $9000 . For days everyone at the home counts the money , rolling the change into proper amounts for the bank . And boys and girls trudge back and forth from the lobby to the storeroom , stacking up food for the " long winter .
