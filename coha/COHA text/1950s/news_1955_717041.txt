txt Leaders of the two major labor federations agreed today on a constitution to govern their combined organization of 15,000.000 members . All that is lacking is a name . Formal , final approval of the charter , and the actual amalgamation of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations is set for the week of Dec. 5 . The ceremonies will be at the Seventy-first Regiment Armory . Thirty-third Street and Park Avenue , New- York . The Joint Unity Committee I that agreed on the constitution today acclaimed it in these words : " It recognizes the equal status of craft and industrial unions . It offers a closed-door policy to unions controlled or directed by Communist or other totalitarians . It promotes democratic unionism . ? " It recognizes that all workers , whatever their race , color , creed or national origin , are entitled to share fully in the benefits of trade unionism . Quick Penalties Provided " It provides effective remedies for keeping the new organization free of both corruption and totalitarianism , and for quick and effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ethical and moral standards to which the public has a right to expect of our affiliated organizations . " It is our belief that this constitution , an amalgam of the best of the C. I. 0 . and A. F. L. constitutions , is without peer as a fundamental charter for a democratically dedicated labor federation . " It is a measure of the spirit of unity which has been uppermost in the minds of the representatives of both the C. L 0 . and A. F. L. that this constitution was so quickly worked out by our committee . We firmly believe that it keeps faith with the hopes and best interests of the men and women of labor and all the citizens of this great nation . We feel certain it will be ratified by the executive bodies and conventions of our two organizations . " The A. F. L. and C. I. 0 . conventions will be held concur // rently in New York on Dec. 1 and 2 . The A. F. L. will meet at the Statler Hotel , the C. I. 0 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a million or so of the organized workers of the country . Among those outside the fold is John L. Lewis ' United Mine Workers union . Mr. Lewis founded the C. I. 0 . in defiance of the A. F. L. Years later he went back to the A. F. L. , only to break with it again . He often advocated a combined labor movement , but he was not consulted in the 1954-55 unity talks that are about to culminate in organic merger . Rail Brotherhoods Out Others not in either federation include the four operating unions of railroad workers , a few Communist-dominated unions , and a scattering of independents . The merger is expected to give fresh impetus to organizing the unorganized . George Meany , the A. F. L. president , will head the merged unit . His director of organization will come from the C. L 0 . The merger also is expected to strengthen labor as a political force , but the labor leaders avow their intention to preserve the independence of the labor movement from political control . They intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention to form a labor party . Striking evidence of labor 's economic and social progress ' over the years is found in a comparison of the . preamble . to the A. F. L. constitution and the preamble agreed on today . The old constitution began with the statement that " a struggle is going on in all the nations of the civilized world between the oppressors and the oppressed of all countries , a struggle between the capitalist and the laborer , which grows in intensity from year to year , * * * " This philosophy of the " class struggle " is missing from the new constitution . In contrast , it says : " At the collective-bargaining table , in the community , in the exercise of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship , we shall responsibly serve the interests of all the American people . " Raiding Is Deplored Fighting words are reserved for " the forces which seek to undermine the democratic institutions of our nation and to enslave the human soul . " These forces the labor leaders vowed to " combat resolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem of membership raiding . It states that " the integrity of each such affiliate of this federation shall be maintained and preserved . " Complaint procedure is set up with final action vested in the biennial convention . . This procedure lacks the swift effectiveness of the no-raiding agreement that a majority of the A. F. L. and the C. I. 0 . unions have signed . Some unions have refused to sign the agreement and it remains to be seen whether their predatory tendencies can be curbed by the procedures set up in the new constitution . Discrimination , which is still a problem in a few A. F. L. unions , is dealt with thus : " All workers , whatever their race , color , creed or national origin are entitled to share in the full benefits of trade union organization . " The constitution sets up a committee , on civil rights that - " shall be vested with the duty and responsibility to assist the Executive Council to bring about at the earliest possible date the effective implementation of the principles stated in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dealt with together . If it is found on investigation that an affiliated union is dominated by either of these influences , the Executive Council , by a two-thirds vote , may suspend the guilty union . A convention may suspend by a majority , roll-call vote . Supplementing this , the constitution provides that " the committee on ethical practices shall be vested with the duty and re'sponsibility to assist the executive council in carrying out the constitutional determination of the Federation to keep the Federation free from any taint of corruption or communism * * " Selection of a name remained the one point of disagreement . The A. F. L. wants to preserve its name . The C. L 0 . prefers an amalgam of the two names , such as the American Congress of Labor .
