txt Loans to brokers and dealers in securities by New York City member banks rose $55 millions in the week ended last Wednesday , to $1,870 millions , the highest figure touched in eleven years . These are loans extended to finance new securities issues , dealers ' inventories of securities and margin buying by customers . As recently as a month ago there would have been little doubt in the mind of anyone who was watching the action of the stock market that these additional loans were headed for the accounts of brokers ' customers trading on margin . At the end of last week , however , no such easy conclusion was possible . For since the last week of April , when The New York Times daily averages of fifty combined stocks reached their high of the 1953-55 stock market boom , the speculative spirit has been , for the time at least , definitely on the wane . As a matter of fact , should the tendencies evinced by the market since the end of January turn out to have been prophetic in character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to take a bow . It would be difficult to persuade the future economics historian , in the absence of further serious speculative eruptions or major misadventures in the months immediately ahead , that the Federal Reserve 's two 10 per cent hikes in margin requirements and the focusing of the spotlight on the market by the Senate Banking Committee were events totally unrelated to the recent evidence that the speculative fever might at last be subsiding . . By the term " the recent evidence " we are not referring to the sell-off in prices since the second increase in margin requirements raised them to 70 per cent just a month ago . What we have in mind is the recent rather clear-cut trend in two important statistics which usually reflect the speculative state of stock trading . The daily volume of market activity crossed the 3-millionshare level in the so-called Eisenhower market last November , when it averaged 3.2 million shares . In December it rose to 3.5 millions and in January to 3.6 millions . Since then it has receded every month , falling to 3.2 millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in April and 2.3 millions thus far in May . The latest monthly figure of the New York Stock Exchange on a customer debit balance ( the best single yardstick we have of the amount of margin buying ) shows the total to have been $2,750 millions at the end of April . That , it is true , represented an increase for the month of $50 millions , but it confirmed earlier evidence that the rate of advance was tapering off . In November , December and January the monthly increases had been , respectively , $110 millions , $150 millions and $170 millions . With February the trend was reversed , and tit ( monthly rate of expansion ha : moved steadily lower . As it stands at the moment this it an encouraging picture of returning sobriety , even though it is necessary to add in the interest of real . ism that it is a picture that is sub ? ject to possible change without ad. vance notice .                   @ @
