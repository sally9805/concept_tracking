Ever since 1936 , when someone splashed water on him during a rowboat trip in Madras Harbor , His Exalted Highness Rustam-I-Dauran , Arastu-I-Zaman , Lieutenant General , Muzaffar-ul-Mulk WalMamalik , Nawab Mir Osman Ali Khan Bahadur , Fateh Jung , Nizam-ud-Daula , Nizam-ul-Mulk , Asaf Jah , G.C.S.L , G.B.E. , Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar , had kept his vow to stay inside his own territory of Hyderabad . But the Nizam , one of the world 's richest and closest-fisted men , relented last week to attend a national conference of Indian regional governors and princely heads of states in New Delhi . <P> Fifty-five retainers were sent on ahead to ready the Nizam 's 100-room New Delhi palace ( which has been mostly taken over by Indian government offices since India absorbed Hyderabad in 1948 ) .

" Only 15 were picked , along with ten of the Nizam 's 36 children and some 56 physicians , barbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to India 's capital . <P> Instead of the frayed and buttonless clothes which he wears around the home palace grounds to save money , the miserly Nizam wore a well-pressed and spotless outfit-yellow turban , tweed coat , loose white trousers and black shoes . He peeled $1,000 off his own bundle ( at least $200 million ) , laid in a supply of tea , cakes , nuts , ice cream , tomato juice and lemon squash , and gave an elegant garden party for New Delhi 's 400 , among them junketing Eleanor Roosevelt and India 's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru . The Nizam gathered six sons and four daughters around him , but stuck his 15 wives behind a cloth screen on a veranda , where they could only watch . <P> Main event of the Nizam 's first trip " outside " in 16 years : a meeting with a few fellow princes and potentates for two days of reflection on the sad state of highnesses now that India is a republic .
