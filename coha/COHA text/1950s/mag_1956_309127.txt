Names make news . Last week these names made this news : <P> <P> After making his way to a literary luncheon in Chicago , seamy-side-of-life Novelist Nelson ( The Man with the Golden Arm ) Algren ( see BOOKS ) deplored authors whose prissy works ignore " the back rooms and gutters . " Resolutely sticking to his conviction that Skid Row makes the choicest book fodder , Chicago Slum Runner Algren heartily stabbed at two contemporary upper-middle-class protagonists : " If Marjorie Morningstar and The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit were being married on my front porch at high noon , I would n't go to the wedding . " <P> <P> Amidst bustling all about the U.S. and the Caribbean area last year , blithe-spirited British **25;14399;TOOLONG Noel Coward got homesick and visited Britain for eight weeks . High price of gratifying his nostalgia : $70,000 , the amount that Britain 's revenooers collected from him because he had set foot on the tight little isle. * Last week , on his way to France by ocean liner , Expatriate Coward gazed fondly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , this beautiful England ! " sighed he . " One step on dear old England for me now and it 's 25,000 gone bang . " Then , heart heavy but his bank account no lighter , he sailed on to France . <P> <P> At New York International Airport , Millionaire Sportsman Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt , legally separated from his wife Jeanne ( TIME , May 21 ) and about to be separated , by his own decision , from most of his racing stable , looked carefree as he emplaned for Brussels and a convention of the World Veterans Federation . Flying with him was Disabled Veteran Harold Russell , onetime cinemactor ( The Best Years of Our Lives ) and an official of the World Veterans Fund headed by Vanderbilt , a wartime Navy lieutenant and PT-boat skipper . <P> <P> Landing in France , Tourist Harry S. ( for Swinomish ) Truman , on his first trip to Europe since 1945 and Potsdam , was soon strolling the streets of Gay Paree , swinging his cane in best boulevardier style , his jauntiness cramped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained Truman , " I was getting some bags down the stairs and stumbled . But it was 7 o'clock in the morning , so nobody can accuse me of anything . " He sipped coffee at the Caf de la Paix , a favorite hangout for Artillery Captain Truman during leaves in World War I. After his short stop in Paris , he headed by train for Rome . Rolling through northern Italy , Democrat Truman grinned wryly at big regional election posters urging , " Vote Republican ! " Boisterously cheered with many a " Viva Truman ! " at Rome 's railroad station , he was hustled to a special VIP waiting room-so fast that Bess Truman got lost in the shuffle , gained entry only after some door pounding . Meeting newsmen , Baptist Truman told them that 1 ) he still favors appointment of a U.S. ambassador to the Vatican , 2 ) he 'll believe Soviet disarmament ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) " when I see it , " but 3 ) the U.S.S.R. 's Bulganin and Khrushchev would get a " cordial reception " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
