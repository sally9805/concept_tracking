THE WEEK WORKING ran PZACZ LAKE SUCCESS ( NR 00000 pondent ) For the historical record , it should be noted that last week the United Nations Assembly took action looking toward the end of the war in Korea . It was the first important step of this character since the Russians came back into the UN and thereby re-established the Big-Power veto in the Security Council . It was also the first ' concrete action under the plan , originally sponsored by the US , to make the Assembly rather than the Security Council tht heart of the peace machinery . It must also be noted for the record that the action for peace was taken in an atmosphere of gloom if not defeatism . Even though this first step did no more than authorize the President of the Assembly to create a committee of himself and two others to find a basis for a possible cease-fire , there was no discernible hope that it would be effective . More important than the formal proceedings under the gray-green fluorescent lights in the conference room were the series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible basis for actually putting an end to the war . Honesty compels the report that the attitude of the United States at this moment is not popular at Lake Success ? far less popular , in fact , than most of the delegates are willing to admit , on the record . It is ironic that while the Wherrys and the Knowlands continue to attack Truman and Acheson as appeasers , most of the delegates representing the democratic world at Lake Success consider these American officials to be much too stubborn and unyielding in their attitude . The delegates do not want to " appease " Communist China ? a semantic word which badly needs to be defined and clarified . The point they make is that there are only two ways to end a war : by unconditional surrender , and by negotiation . Nobody wants the UN forces in Korea to surrender unconditionally ; therefore , we must , at some point , negotiate . Yet the United States , at least as viewed from Lake Success , has been insisting on impossible conditions for the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this view , that the UN army is taking " one hell of a licking . " We seem still to have the psychology of the victor , whereas there is no doubt that if Communist China wants to , she can make our continued foothold on the Korean Peninsula unendurably expensive . In short , there are three major viewpoints at Lake Success : those of the Communist bloc , of the United States and of the majority of the other members of the UN . This majority feels that it is tied perforce to the American chariot wheel for many reasons , among which are our overwhelming economic strength and our military potential . It agrees with us about the immorality of aggression such as occurred in Korea last June . It wants the UN to be in a position to halt such aggression in the future . It feels , however , that the position of the US is not a pure UN position ; that men like Wherry and Knowland are activated partly by a desire for the unilateral use of American power and that Acheson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wherrys and Know-lands . The UN delegates believe that this situation brings closer the danger of a third world war . Again for the historical record , it might be noted that the Assembly , in the closing days before its recess , failed to do anything about Southwest Africa ; failed to do anything about the holy places in Jerusalem ; talked about combining the study of atomic weapons and of conventional armaments ; and ignored a third plea for help from Tibet . It prepared to ask Russia what ever became of the two million German , Italian and Japanese war prisoners . The World ? Health Organization is going to study alcoholism , and will tell the inhabitants of tropical countries about a new drug which seems effective against leprosy . Some of these are extremely useful enterprises ; it is only against the background of Korean War and the threat of world war that they inevitably seem somewhat academic and remote . MONOPOLY NT MERGER For the last 50 years , every US President has expressed deep concern over the growing power of the giant industrial combines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been attacked since the industrial revolution began . But Congress has done very little about monopoly since it passed the Clayton Anti-Trust Act in 1914 which made it illegal for one corporation to acquire the stock of another " where the effect . . . may be to substantially lessen competition ... . " They might as well have passed a law against sin . Instead of buying the stock , the big corporations merely bought the assets of smaller corporations . This loophole stayed in the law for 36 years . It took a lame-duck session of the 81st Congress to plug it up . At least the Senate last week passed , 55 to 22 , a bill to do the job . The House had already passed a companion bill early last year , and Capitol Hill observers seem to think it will become law before Congress adjourns this month . Pessimists may ask : what 's the difference ? One-tenth of one percent of all corporations already control nearly half of all corporate assets , while 99.9 percent control the other half . Two percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent . Are n't we just a little bit too late ? Proponents of the bill look at it differently . It 's better to have the degree of concentration that we now have than to have it continue to go up . Furthermore , with new enterprises constantly arising , the result may possibly mean a gradual diffusion of economic power and more competition . In view of all the work involved in beating down attempts to weaken antitrust laws , it is a pleasant change to make some progress toward strengthening them . ? RAILWAY STRIKE Failure of Government officials successfully to mediate the railway labor dispute which brought about seizure of the lines last August 25 was the cause of the recent railroad strikes . Presidential Assistant John R. Steelman and the National Railroad Mediation Board have had four months ? seemingly more than enough time ? to effect an agreement between the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the operators . The mediators do not seem to have attached proper seriousness to the danger of a transportation shut-down in the midst of the Korean crisis . One can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at so long a delay in the settlement of their just grievances . Approximately one million non-operating railway employees have been enjoying 48-hours ' pay for 40-hours ' work for more than a year now , while railroad men who belong to the BRT union have continued to work alongside them in the same yards at the old 40-hour pay rate . The trainmen have also seen millions of industrial workers win pay increases even before their contracts expired . American labor history shows that nationwide labor stoppages as extensive as those now occurring on the railroads have customarily occasioned Presidential action . From Wilson to Roosevelt , the usual course has been for the . President personally to call in the leaders of the unions and the railroads . In 1941 , just before Pearl Harbor , Franklin Roosevelt averted what might have been a disastrous railroad shutdown by appointing Wayne Morse as special mediator . A 69-hour session in that case produced agreement and prevented the strike . Failure to follow the historic formula for settlement led to the costly railroad strike of 1946 . It was only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday night , brought union and management executives together for their first joint meeting since last August . Settlement appears likely at this writ-. ing , but will the President always have an emergency address ready when John Steelman muddles ? ' TITO TOG= GOOD RISE Spurred by a crisis mood which has made the US much less choosy in finding its allies , the Congress easily passed a $38-million aid bill for Yugoslavia to provide food for that anti-Soviet bastion . There was some talk during the debate about the US plane the Yugoslays shot down several years ago and their lack of religious freedom , but the picture of Tito 's reported 32 divisions ready to fight on our side was enticing enough to hold the isolationists to only 21 votes on the final Senate roll call . The closest the Republicans came to scuttling the program was the 42 to 38 vote on an amendment by Sen. William Knowland ( R , Cal. ) which would have forced attaching an " Aid to Chiang Kai-shek " string to the bill . Knowland 's proposal'to halt aid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five GOP Senators ? Aiken ( Vt . ) , Flanders ( Vt . ) , Smith ( Me . ) , Tobey ( N. H. ) and Wiley ( Wis . ) . The GOP " Asialationists " were joined by four Democrats , including Sen. Pat McCarran ( Nev. ) , who denounced Tito as a " brigand and murderer of the first order who is destroying every phase of godliness there is in his country , " and Sen. John McClellan ( Ark. ) whose comment on the provision that 50 percent of the aid be required to travel in American ships was : " Why not make it 100 percent ? If we are to fly our flag over there , why not let the people over there see it as often as possible . " The backhanded GOP attack was characterized by the remarks of Sen. Robert Taft ( R , Ohio ) , the Party 's reputed intellectual . " Many Senators , " he said , " may hesitate to vote for aid to a man who has killed American boys , who murdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a general policy , that Nationalist China be treated in the same way . " The Senate vote on the Knowland amendment indicated a deplorable falling away of usually responsible Republicans . Of the GOP members of the Foreign Relations Committee , most of whom have given fairly consistent support to bi-partisan policy legislation in the past , only Sen. Alexander Wiley ( Wis. ) resisted the " Asialationists ' ? ' call on this ballot . Of the five Republican Senators with the best foreign policy records during this Congress , three ? Morse ( Ore . ) , Smith ( N. J. ) , and Ives ( N.Y. ) ? followed Knowland 's line , and Lodge ( Mass. ) abstained . While this vote can not be regarded as a full-scale test of Administration strength , it is disturbing to note that if the same issue were to have been voted on next month ? when four of the supporting Democrats will be replaced by isolationist victors in the November elections ? the crucial aid program to Yugoslavia would have been defeated by the China lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill by a still narrower final vote of 225142 , and where Vito Marcantonio ( ALP , N. Y. ) ironically cast his swan-song vote against Communist Tito , the responsible note of needed realism was best sounded by Jacob Javits ( R , N. Y. ) : " What we are doing is to . . . give the United States Government an opportunity to make this aid to Tito as useful to us in our struggle against the Communists as possible , and to make it as harmful to the Kremlin as possible . " JIM CROW WI/15 IN MACON PORTLAND , ORE . ( KR pendent ) For the first time in American history , the issue of civil rights was decided by popular vote on November 7 . The electorate of Portland , Ore. , narrowly rejected an ordinance forbidding discrimination in public places because of a person 's color-76,444 votes to 61,058 . The civil-rights bill fared far better in wealthy , upper-class neighborhoods than in districts inhabited largely by working men and women . Analysis of the vote by precincts shows a slender favorable margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is approximately $12,000 . A number of working-class districts defeated the ordinance by margins exceeding 2 to 1 . The traditionally Republican Oregonian , whose influence is infinitely greater among conservatives than among working people , led the campaign for civil rights . The restaurant and tavern owners and realtors opposing the ordinance maintained that property values would diminish because of contiguity to Negroes . This danger did not appear too imminent to people with impressive estates and mansions . Because Portland is a conservative city which returned lop-sided Republican majorities last month , the civil-rights result is generally considered a favorable sign . The narrow rejection of the ordinance contrasted notably with the nearly 3-to-1 beating inflicted on a statewide FEPC bill in California in 1946 . And the question of social equality is generally more loaded with political dynamite than that of parity in jobs . It is probable that the sponsors of civil rights will try again . This measure reached the ballot after its unanimous passage by the city council . Beer parlors , hotels and restaurants then invoked the referendum because the bill threatened their privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil rights probably will take the initiative in placing the measure before the electorate . TEM AMA 'S TROJAN awr The American Medical Association announced recently that it would contribute $500,000 to the 79 accredited medical schools in the nation . The sum was only a fraction of the $3.6 million collected from the AMA this year in $25 assessments from physicians . But it was the best the AMA could do , considering that the balance of the sum had been used up for lobbying expenses and the October advertising campaign against the President 's health insurance program . The donation was obviously designed to offset criticism of the doctor lobby for having blocked the aid to medical education bill which passed the Senate early this year but was shelved by a House committee when the AMA announced its opposition . Louis H. Bauer , chairman of the AMA Board of Trustees , admitted that the $500,000 would n't " build very much , " but he said , " We hope the idea will get going like a snowball down hill , perhaps even starting a chain reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Senate-passed medical education bill would have established a $250-mi1lion emergency five-year program to increase the supply of doctors , nurses and personnel trained in dentistry , hospital administration and public health . Construction grants would be made for establishing new schools and expanding existing ones , and medical colleges would receive grants to meet the costs of instruction with incentives for increasing enrolments . The President urged action on this bill during the special session on the grounds that the defense programs and civil defense needs make it more urgent than ever before . Rep. Andrew Biemiller ( D , Wis. ) , author of the House bill , points out that " the AMA donation is about one percent of the minimum needs of American medical schools , and there are no more private donations in sight . It is a Trojan gift serving no purpose but that of fatal indecision and inaction . " CIVIL DEFENSE BEGINS Spurred by sudden hysteria over possible air attacks on the nation 's cities , federal officials are trying to rush delayed preparations for civil defense . Several Congressional committees are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil Defense Administration under former Florida Governor Millard Caldwell , as well as a proposal to provide $190 million for the dispersal of Government offices through the Virginia and Maryland countrysides . Locally , many cities and states are building their own organizations into operating concerns . But the going is slow , and the country is far from prepared against attack . What fault there is lies with the entire country , lulled into five years of life-asusual . But , behind the scenes , responsible officials have been trading bitter recriminations . The strongest attack came from the American Municipal Association , a powerful group representing 10,000 city and town administrations . The mayors were up in arms over lack of plans and assistance on civil defense and bitterly attacked the outline program finally presented to Congress . Federal officials retorted that the cities were waiting for Washington to do everything for them , including paying all the bills , and pointed to the few cities like Chicago , Seattle and New York which have gone ahead to set up the skeleton organizations recommended by the experts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luncheon meeting December 6 . Administrator Caldwell put in a brief appearance , begged off because of the pressure of work and left the floor to his aide , James J. Wadsworth , whose speech took the form of an open and caustic attack on " dissenters " who shirked " their responsibilities to their own people . " In his fervor , he scarcely mentioned his own agency 's handicap in having had only a limited $1.2-million appropriation while preparing the blueprints necessary for a huge and complicated national program . The city officials struck back hard . Led by able , young Richard Graves , secretary of the California League of Municipalities , they unanimously supported a resolution calling for abolishing the new independent Civil Defense Agency and placing its powers in the Department of Defense . Putting control in the hands of the military is opposed by most thinking observers , including Generals Marshall and Omar Bradley , and the mayors ' resolution seemed mainly a gesture of exasperation and spite . But the AMA 's other big point , that the federal agency should work directly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often rurally-dominated legislatures , has more merit . Mrs. Dorothy McCullough Lee , Mayor of Portland , Oregon , pointed out that it had taken five weeks for a vital directive to reach her under the present system , by which all communica tion is channeled through state civil-defense authorities . But only Fiorello LaGuardia , head of the Office of Civil Defense during the latter part of World War II , successfully bucked the traditional pattern by which federal agencies work through the states , the patronage units preferred by Congress . Meanwhile the shelters , the emergency equipment and the stand-by organization for handling a potential attack moved one step nearer materializition with the presentation to Congress of CDA 's $3.1-billion program , scheduled to be complete by 1953 . Costs are to be borne about equally by federal and local governments , with the former providing critical materials and helping finance the construction of shelters , while the cities are responsible for furnishing additional equipment and administration . Eventually the CDA expects to have 3,000 experts and administrators in Washington and in regional . offices ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . The job is a tremendous one . States must be made conscious of their cities ' vulnerability , and cities will have to stretch their facilities and financial resources to be ieady for any possible danger .
