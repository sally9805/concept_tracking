DILL S11 WWI HE voting booths in Parker County , Texas , had been closed for two hours when it began to rain . Hardly more than a sprinkle , it would have gone unnoticed almost anywhere else . But for Parker County 's farmers and townsfolk it was the first heaven-sent moisture in weeks , promising an end to the summer-long drought that had withered the corn and burned the pastures brown . Watching the rain fall , a tilling-station operator exclaimed with prophetic jubilation , " They 're Democratic tears ! Ike must be sweeping the country ! " Since Election Day much of the immediate excitement over Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower 's astonishing landslide has been tempered by a tendency to play it down as little more than the " personal " triumph of a war hero . Actually the more one studies it the more  --  not less  --  impressive his victory becomes . For as one examines the voting returns ward by ward in the major cities and county by county in the more important states an almost unbelievable fact emerges  --  save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New Deal influence in the voting . From the Eisenhower electoral maps the proverbial visitor from Mars would never know that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived ! After any of the last five presidential contests , for example , one could lay the income map of any city alongside of the election figures and find that economic standing and voting pretty much matched . Some of Eisenhower ' , most spectacular gains , however , came in relatively low-income , worker areas where the label " Republican " customarily evokes images of silk-hatted bunkers or chauffeur-driven limousines . Similarly , outside of the once Solid South , roughly 670 counties turned in Democratic majorities through all the Roosevelt-Truman elections . At least a fourth swung to Eisenhower . In New England , AI Smith carried nine populous counties which remained religiously Democratic afterward .

Calvin Coolidge to win a substantial following among both Catholics and Yankees in New England . In Illinois , Indiana , Maryland and New Mexico he took counties which never voted for a Republican for President before . It has been a long , long time since any President drew electoral support from every section of the nation , from the grandchildren of both Union and Confederate veterans , from both farms and cities , suburbs and slums . The historic significance of Eisenhower 's victory unquestionably lies in just this fact  --  that his vote rose above the many bitter , partisan cleavages of the past . But if that is the most challenging single development of the election , it remains the most puzzling . How did it come about and what does it mean ? Was the New Deal repudiated ? Or were people voting on unrelated issues ? Has the Roosevelt coalition been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for new leadership to regroup themselves ? In short , was Eisenhower 's sweep of thirty-nine states , including all those north of the Mason and Dixon 's line , a freakish political event ? Or was it a political revolution , inaugurating a new era ? This article will try to answer those questions , basing its conclusions on two intensive grass-roots surveys of voter feeling . For four months , throughout the campaign , I traveled from coast to coast , talking to voters of every description . After the election , I made a second , similar tour , hitting the places which " broke " most spectacularly for Eisenhower . Both trips together took me into thirty cities and seventeen farm counties . In all my interviews , I made special efforts to learn why former supporters of Roosevelt and Harry Truman switched . That they felt it was " time for a change " went without raying , but why were they so strong for " change " despite the prevailing prosperity ? What did they want changed most ? Were they merely protesting against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ? At the outset it is worth noting that this was probably our most emotional election since William McKinley beat William Jennings Bryan . The intensity of popular feeling can be seen in the record turnout of 61,000,000 voters , nearly 13,000,000 more than in 1948 . Several editors reported new levels of abusiveness in their campaign mail . A number of persons told me they " prayed not once but several times " before casting their ballots . Television may he partly responsible . Many TV viewers must have subconsciously identified themselves with the candidates much as movie fans project themselves vicariously into the boots and slippers of their favorite heroes and heroines . In Youngstown , Ohio , one woman told how her husband became an ardent admirer of Sen. Estes Kefauver by watching his crime-commission hearings over television , " When Stevenson was nominated , " this woman recalled , " my husband was so mad he snapped off the TV set and swore be would vote for Ike . " The Choice : Depression or Wartime Prosperity B UT the main reason why the election was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle which millions of voters fought within themselves between two clashing sets of emotions ? their dread of another depression and their frustration over the seemingly endless stalemate in Korea . This struggle was unquestionably the decisive conflict of the entire election . Wherever I went during the campaign I found the fear of a return of " them Hoover times " with the strongest single Democratic asset . Repeatedly voters declared in effect , " I do n't like lots of things in Washington , but I remember the soup lines . " On the Republican side , several issues were winning them former Democratic votes  --  higher prices and tax s , charges of communism and corruption in government , the sheer weariness over the Democrats ' being so long in power . But what provokedthe angriest condemnations of the Truman Administration from traditional Democratic voters was " the useless war " in Korea , as BO many termed it . Like two powerful wrestlers , the memory of the depression and the frustration over Korea came to grips with each other in the arena that was the voter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of Democratic political power in the country was broken . " They do n't shoot Santa Claus " runs the old adage . What happened last November , though . was that surprising numbers of voters actually came to resent the prevailing prosperity as " bought by the lives of our boys in Korea . " There was a general feeling that the Korean war was all that stood in the way of an economic recession . From accepting that belief , many persons moved on emotionally to where they felt something immoral and guilt-laden in the " you never had it better " argument of the Democrats . In Weatherford , Texas . this revealing incident was told me by Dan F. McKenzie . Near the campaign 's end several elderly pensioners were sitting around the public square . One or two talked of voting for Eisenhower . A Stevenson supporter stopped to argue , " If the Republicans win , they 'll cut your pensions . You 'll all be selling apples again . " Retorted one pensioner , " Maybe so , but at least it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons the election became a choice of voting for war or hard times . " We must stop trading blood for money , " declared James Stringham , an Iowa farmer who supported Truman in 1948 . " Anyone can see the Korean war is all that is holding up prices . I 'd rather see prices come down than keep them up through war . " An auto worker in Detroit had been inclined to vote for Gov . Adlai E. Stevenson because " we always made good money " under the Democrats , " I finally decided it was blood money , " he told me . " We 're willing to do with a bit tear to end the war .

" Then an older man in the shop argued was n't war better than a depression . I refused to accept the idea that we need a war to keep our jobs . " A Texas farm wife remained undecided until three days before the election . She felt Stevenson " made better speeches " and " was even the smarter man . ' What finally swung her to Eisenhower was the depression talk . " I was through the last one and know how bad it waft , " she recalled . " But my son is going into the Army soon . The Democrats seemed to be saying prosperity was more important than the life of my boy . " Many families with sons in the service or nearing draft age felt they were being tested before God as to which they valued more highly  --  dollars or lives Some feared their loved ones might be struck down if they mode the callous , materialistic choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the Korean outbreak to Election Day more than 1,000,000 youths were drafted and nearly 1,000,000 more reservists and National Guardsmen were called into active duty . Most of the families affected were bitterly resentful . A reservist in Detroit , back from Korea , was angry at " having my life upset for a war that is n't getting anywhere . " Asked bow she was voting , one San Francisco woman replied , " They just called my husband back into service . Need I say more ? " One of her neighbors . Mrs. C. E. Juergent7i , a widow with two sons in the service , felt the Korean war was " unnecessary . " In marking their ballots for Eisenhower , many persons , of course , hoped to bring their sons and husbands back home . Still , the election should not be interpreted as a vote for peace at any price . It was more a vote of impatience with the frustrating state of neither war nor peace . " I 'm against this idea that we can go on trading hills in Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Truman voter who shifted for Eisenhower . " We 've got to end it one way or the other . My boy is in the Air Force . Naturally , I want peace . But if it 's a war that we 're in , then let 's fight it with everything we 've got . If it 's not a war , then let 's get out of there . " Similar sentiments were expressed by others I interviewed . A Pittsburgh youth cast his first ballot for Eisenhower because " I want this stalemate over with- I just got my draft papers . I 'm ready to fight Russia if that 's how it has to be . But I do n't see any sense to fighting endlessly in Korea ? for what ? " This impatience with the Korean attrition apparently intensified as the campaign progressed . Last summer the voters I interviewed divided about evenly over having " a military man " as President . Some feared Eisenhower " because war is the only business he TlIE SATURDAY knows . " Others fell " Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Presiden This hitter feeling grow stronger as hopes fora cease-lire in Korea waned . In mid-August , for example , Fred Meyers , of Houston , Texas , with two draft-ago /ions , told me , " If the war is ' settled , I 'll be for Stevenson . If not , it 's Ike . If we ca n't get a truce , I figure we 'll need a military man for the next four years to clean things up . " Much has been made of Eisenhower 's promise to visit Korea , with some commentatore contending that this promise swung t he elect ion . This melodramatic notion ignores the fact that popular impatience with the Korean stalemate has risen steadily since the fall of 1950 , when the Chinese Reds intervened and started what Gen. Douglas MacArthur termed " a new war . " The " break " among Democrats over Korea was under way long before the campaign began . Next to Korea and the draft , the heaviest Democratic defections came over inflat ion ? higher prices , mounting taxes and too much spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that way cut taxes , " said a Pittsburgh truck driver , always Democratic before . A Los Angeles construction worker moaned , " These prices are eating me up . " A San Francisco bus driver swung Republican because " there 's too much waste " and " we 're giving foreign countries too much for what we get from them . " Irritation over inflation was particularly strong in low-income areas , which again helps explain why Eisenhower cut across the lines of New Deal voting . Many white-collar workers . such as Howard Price , forty-year-old bookkeeper , of Cleveland , switched from Truman to Ike because of hardships imposed by the inflation . In middle-class precincts I often found families who had recently climbed out of poorer neighborhoods and who remained grateful to the Democratic Party for their gains . Among those unable to climb , the struggle to make mouths and stomachs meet , with living costs and taxes et record levels , stirred widespread unrest . A good deal has been written about women voting for Eisenhower while EVENING POST their husbanda stuck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in voting between wives and I andel nits . Where 130F113 /lad been drafted , fathers were 118 emotionally disturbed 11H mothers . If the " little woman " was more likely to he upset by grocery bills , the husband was apt to grumble " taxes take a full day of my pay " or " everything you touch is taxed . " In many neighborhoods did note that the swing to Eisenhower seemed sharpest among the youngest and oldest voters , with Democratic solidarity strongest among the middle-aged . This latter group bad the most vivid memories of the depression , which often were not shared by younger voters , Recently married couples . particularly where husbands had not yet developed skills , were likely to protest , " You can call this prosperity , but we never have any money left after our bills are paid . " Youthful voters also seemed more agitated by charges of corruption . They were more drawn to Eisenhower personally , many having served under him during the last war . Among the older voters were many retired persona and widows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cincinnati a retired fireman , a lifelong Democrat , was for Eisenhower because " higher prices made me give up my chewing tobacco . " Other retired persons had been forced to find jobs to supplement the shrinking value of their pensions . " I 've had enough giveaway Government , " said a widow in a poor Los Angeles precinct which Henry Wallace carried four years ago . " They say we never had it better . How can you be better off if your savings are cut in half ? " Similarly , " the huge army on the public payroll " has long been reckoned a prime Democratic political asset . Many Government workers turned against the Administration because , with incomes lagging behind prices and taxes , they were worse off than four years ago . Declared one New York City policeman , " I 've had to cut out my beer , and that hurts . " Even where wages were being increased supposedly in pace with living costs , workers were dissatisfied . " We 're getting a three-cents-an-hour raise because prices are going up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " demanded one auto worker . " Everything goes up faster ' than wages . It would he better if both wages and prices came down . " lnflet ion must also be recorded as a major factor in shifting the farm belt back to the Republicans . In 1948 , Truman carried more than 200 largely rural counties which voted Republican in 1944 . Eisenhower overturned every one of them , along with others which had been Democratic through the New Deal ern . One point to Eisenhower 's advantage was his pledge of continued price supports , avoiding the mistake made by Gov . Thomas E. Dewey , Four years ago , fear of an approaching recession gripped the farm belt , yet in his campaign talks Dewey said nothing about what he would do if farm prices tumbled . Not only did Eisenhower outbid the Democrats on a farm program in this election but the economic fears of farmers were being counteracted by angers over Korea and the draft  --  also by a widespread feeling that continued inflation was a more serious threat than a possible price slump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as an Ohioan put it , " If this inflation keeps up , never get to buy a farm . The defense bonds I 've been holding are losing value daily . I 'm further from buying a farm than four years ago . " Other farmers protested that with operating costs rising , " the money you make just does n't reach " or " we handle more money than ever , but do n't keep much of it . " One Iowa farmer complained , " The price of machinery has doubled since 1947 , but I get a fourth less for my hogs now . Either the Government should control all prices or leave them alone . " Then , many farmers had used the last four years to pay off their debts and ready themselves financially for the ? ' shaking out " they felt must come . These farmers thought " prices ca n't keep rising forever " and " the sooner we get off t he high horse the better . " No one I talked with believed " the dollar will ever again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was general against " going deeper into debt " and for cutting taxesand " getting thedollar hack to something like its real value . " In some farm states , like Iowa , Nebraska and South Dakota , Eisenhower carried every county ? something which has n't happened since 1920 . Why even counties with the strongest Democratic traditions failed to stand up against the Eisenhower sweep becomes clear if we dig through the election returns to find those where the Democrats lost most heavily . In state after state , these counties fall into two general groupings . First , there are those whose voting has followed a Southern pattern , like Pike in Illinois , Clay in Missouri or Brown in Ohio . Some of these counties have been ' consistently Democratic since the Civil War ; others departed from their Democratic regularity only once before , in 1928 , even as did their Southern cousins . Their heavy swing to Eisenhower means , of course , that the revolt which swept the South projected itself across the Mason and Dixon 's line . One of Roosevelt 's political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the North . Through Eisenhower that process has been quickened and extended . The second group of farm comities showing the biggest Eisenhower gams are those inhabited mainly by GermanAmericim. particularly of Catholic background . In the peat , theme counties have been strongly " isolationist . " Democratic by traalition , they broke sharply for the Republicans in both 1920 and 1940 . Four years ago , with the second World War over and Roosevelt dead , they returned to I he Democratic fold , giving Truman his margin of victory in several states , including Ohio and Iowa , Last November they swung back to their wartime way of voting . Some of these counties gave Eisenhower the same percentage of their vote that Wendell Willkie got in 1940 . During the campaign I visited six of these counties in four states . In all I found anger over the draft particularly intense . Also people tended to link t he Korean war to the same chain of " blundering " which got us into the last war against Germany and on the side of England and Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormed George Recker , of Dyersville , Iowa . " Why ca n't we have good times without war ? I 've had two boys wounded in Korea . That 's too high a price for prosperity . I 'd rather have hard times . " In nearby Luxemburg . Joe Steffen , a Democratic election judge , broke for Eisenhower because of " all this spending and taxes , and they 're getting ready to draft my boy and I 'm too old to run this farm alone . " In the cities , as well , the " break " for Eisenhower was particularly heavy among Catholic groups , mainly of Polish , Italian , German and Irish extraction . That Stevenson 's divorce alienated some Catholic voters was indicated by occasional remarks like , " How can a man run the country if he ca n't keep his family together ? " This seems to have been a minor factor , though . compared to the effect of the charges " linking " Stevenson with Alger Hiss and with the prevailing suspicions of communist infiltration . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewife . " But I do n't like Acheson . If we do n't get a change , we 'll never get the communists out of Washington . " Still , in relatively few instances did the " communist " issue stand by itself SS the cause of Democratic defections . In Pittsburgh , Detroit and Cleveland sampled predominantly Catholic precincts which Truman had won tidily , but which swung for Eisenhower . All these precincts I found had been hard hit by the draft . This was especially true of Polish-Americans and ItaloAmericans , who have proportionately more sons of military age than the nation as a whole , because of heavy birth rates years ago . Disillusionment over Yalta and hatred of Russia contributed to the Polish-American break . In Milwaukee one Polish priest voted Republican for the first time in his life because " we 've been too soft with Russia . " This desire for a stiffer foreign policy was also reflected in the numerous Polish-Americans who favored Eisenhower " because he 's a military man . " Considering Eisenhower 's mighty majority , the controversy over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the camOttign . Still , the influence of " McCarthyism " can be seen in the election returns . During the campaign I found that reactions to the Wisconsin senator generally mirrored how people had felt about our participation in the last war . Among groups with " isolationist " memories , like the German-Americans , Italo-Americans and Irish-Americana , the common reaction was likely to be . " I do n't like all of McCarthy 's tactics , but he 's thinking of Americo first . " Among these groups Eisenhower 's vote leaped 10 and 15 per cent over 1948 . In contrast , his endorsement of McCarthy nod Indiana Sen. William Jenner was usually condemned most sharply by those who had supported Roosevelt 's foreign policy mail loyally . For example , among . Jewish voters . many of whom subconsciously link isolation jam with H itleriam , Stevenson ran better than Truman did in cities like Chicago and Philadelphia . and suffered only slight losses in other cities like Boston and Karnali ; City . The one element in the Roosevelt coalition which held most firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , their vote shows a Democratic rise over 1948 . In some areas they cast staggering majorities . Ten Negro precincts in Houston , Texas , voted 97 per cent for Stevenson . Sensational as is this cracking of the Democratic majorities in the big cities  --  always the strongest Roosevelt citadels  --  it does not mean the New Deal was being repudiated . There unquestionably was a conservative turn among Democratic voters . Only a handful of the voters I interviewed expressed any desire for further social reform , while many opposed any extension of Government activity that cast money ? and kept taxes up . Aiding foreign countries was criticized freely . Stevenson 's stand on civil rights was resented by some white voters , particularly in neighborhoods near where Negroes had bought homes . Still other Democrats switched " to preserve the two-party system " or because " labor has grown too strong . " " I 'm not against unions , " explained a Wisconsin schoolteacher who swung for Eisenhower . " But I do n't like the populace getting caught all the time between capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There should he an impartial board to make them settle these disputes . " Significantly , this teacher added , " I wanted a change , but there are lots of good things the Democrats did I do n't want undone . " Other Democrats who shifted drew a sharp distinction between Truman and Roosevelt that wean wonderful program Roosevelt started , but Truman was n't the man to carry it on , " said a St. Paul railroader  --  or between Eisenhower and the Republican Party . In Detroit one worker was explaining to me why he was for Eisenhower . Mainly he wanted " this inflation stopped " and was " sick of politicians running the country . " His ten-year-old boy interrupted to ask , " Daddy , what is the difference between a Democrat and a Re-publican ? " " That 's a good question , son , " the father replied . " The Republicans are for people with money and the Democrats are for us poor people . " Voting for Eisenhower had clearly not erased in this man 's mind the consciousness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-to-do which Roosevelt etched out so sharply . Along with this break in the " big-city " coalition came another striking development of considerable significance for the future . Around New York , Chicago and Cleveland , the suburbs actually rolled up heavier majorities for the Republicans than these cities gave the Democrats  --  the first time since the advent of Roosevelt that the suburbs have overshadowed the cities politically . The tremendous rise in suburban population is only partly reWinitinued on Page 78 ) REGULARITY  --  A delicious breakfast of hot , creamy Quaker Oats . helps overcome irregu- O lenity due to lack of bulk in your diet .

Nowhere does this feat show up more plainly than in the South . It was in Dixie 's urban centers that Eisenhower rolled up his winning pluralities . For example , in Toms , which he carried by 138,000 , t he four counties containing Dallas , Houston , Fort Worth and San Antonio alone gave him a 120,00() plurality . The main driving force behind this urban insurgency was a long-brewing revolt of middle-class Southerners , whose numbers have increased spectacularly as a result of Lhe industrial boom in the South over the last two decades . Looking to business  --  not Government ? for Dixie 's future economic progress , this rising middle class has long been seeking some means of defeating the Democratic Administration in Washington , Talking with typical middle-class voters in these Southern cities I found their most frequently voiced complaints were over " destructive taxation " and " all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But if the campaign had been fought on economic issues alone , Eisenhower would never have garnered 4,000,000 Southern votes . He also won over substantial numbers of workers and farmers , who were largely satisfied with the New Deal 's economic benefits . Among these two groups the main reasons given me for the shift in voting were the " blood war " in Korea , corruption and long-smoldering antagonisms over civil rights . " I 'd rather have a depression , " declared one Florida farmer , " than have Negroes put over us . " In Texas there was the additional factor of resentment over the tidelands issue . The Eisenhower forces in the South were also better organized in many areas and generally far more zealous than the loyal Democrats . In Dallas , for example . Mrs. Laura Coursey , Jr. , did n't bother to vote four years ago . This time , feeling " the survival of our country was at stake , " she acted as a baby-sitter on Election Day so that mothers could vote . In Parker County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stevenson campaign manager remarked , " If it took this landslide to get that Truman crowd out , that 's all right with me . We did our best , but people raised questions that were . bard to answer , like this big national debt , the mess in Washington and Korea . " The Eisenhower manager in Parker County , Jack L. Eidson , a thirty-year-old doctor , had never taken part in politics before . What he lacked in experience he more than made up in enthusiasm . Often , after a day of surgery or of looking down the throats of patients , he took to the road , making speeches and political calls until bedtime . He also circularized every registered voter in the county , something that had never been done before . One woman returned a card with a question about how to obtain an absentee ballot . She lived in a far-oft corner of the county . To her astonishment , the youthful doctor showed up at her door . " I did n't intend to vote , " she confeeeed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , I 'll make sure I vote . " In past presidential elections in the South how any one person voted made slight difference , of course . One lasting EVENING POST effect of the Eisenhower " crusade " may lie I hat it introduced the South to the int ensive electioneering methods common for AO long in the North , Not only in the South but through the whole country I he pattern of Elliott-bower 's victory shapes up as mainly the product of two developments . First , and most important , was a general voters ' revolt which overrode all economic , sect ional and party linen and which centered mainly nround Korea , the draft , inflation and corruption . Second . even while this was happening , the Roosevelt coalition was being torn apart by its own inner contradictions rind accumulated tensions . Significantly , the sorest losses came among the elements with the oldest Democratic tradition  --  the Southerners and Catholics ? while the newer , " liberal " elements which Roosevelt attracted to the party held relatively better . For this Democratic crackup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Few of the voters I talked with criticized Stevenson personally . In fact , early in the campaign I found many Democrats who favored Stevenson because they thought him sufficiently independent of Truman to " give us a real change " in Washington . The more vehemently Truman campaigned the more vigorously he hacked away at Stevenson 's independence . This was particularly important in the South , where Truman 's name had become a symbol of everything objectionable politically . Said one Texan , " My doubts about voting for Eisenhower were settled when Truman started campaigning " Two voters I encountered actually thought Truman was the candidate . His vituperative attacks on Eisenhower disgusted some Democratic voters . In Cleveland a school employee told me he had been so devoted to Roosevelt that he prayed for him regularly . He voted for Eisenhower " because he 's a gentleman and Truman is not . " Several other Democrats said they felt Truman " tore the dignity oft the office of President . " So strong was the tide of revulsion against " Trumanism " that probably any Republican candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The choice of Eisenhower as the GOP nominee did make the difference , I would judge , between what might have been a narrow Republican squeeze and the landslide that occurred . Yet it would he a mistake to think the electorate was swept off its feet by hero worship or by any Freudian yearning for a " father symbol . " If to many persons Eisenhower appeared as " the great man this country always produces in times of need , " others told me they voted for him " only as the lesser of two evils . " Perhaps his strongest asset was his lack of past political partisanship , which made it easier for him to win over former Truman and Roosevelt supporters who still distrusted the Republican Party . Hia was a " personal " rather than " party " victory , not because of the dazzle of his personality , but because he served as a substitute for a reshuffling of both major parties . For the GOP his inauguration brings both an opportunity ? and a trial . Today the famed Roosevelt coalition seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together again . A great many voters not only switched , they changed their political allegiance . Take the case of Mr. and Mrs. Charles J. Rose , of Pittsburgh . Always previously for Roosevelt and Truman , they changed their registration to Republican and campaigned all ..... or , 1963 the way out for the Republicans . Yet the next four yearn could wreck the Republicans politically . Should the economic indices start tumbling , the fault would really rest with the heritage of inflation that Truman built up and left behind . But to most voters any return of large-scale unemployment would come as confirmation of all the misgivings and fears that lurked in the minds of many New Republicans even as they voted for Eisenhower . In the South many persons still remember that the bolt against Al Smith was followed by a depression . Should that parallel repeat itself , the cause of a two-partySout hoseeminglyso promising today , would he pushed back a full genera lion . All elections inspire conflicting interpretations as to what the people voted for . My own judgment is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the election was mainly a mandate for two things  --  first for bringing the Korean war to a decisive end , peaceably if possible , but by war if that is the only alternative , and second , for giving the dollar a stable value . Domestically , it was a vote to halt further social reforms and , as one Miamian put it , " to let the pendulum swing the other way a bit . " But it was not a vote for a twenty-yeur rollback of history . To the contrary , the impreasion left with me was that the dominant concern of the voters was how to preserve the gains of those years . Their alarm over inflation largely reflected the fear that these gains were tieing imperiled by a Government which had pushed spending too far  --  to where all savings were losing value . In my analysis of the 1948 election I pointed out that the people who supplied Truman 's margin of victory were voting for preserving their gains through moderation in government . That is essentially what those who elected Eisenhower were voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significance is the fact that so many persons clearly put foreign affairs above their domestic concerns , even to voting consciously against what they considered their pocketbook interest . In this respect the election may have been a remarkable vindication of the American political system . When 1952 opened , the lines of partisan cross-conflict were so bitterly tangled , with New Deal loyalties and antagonisms so fresh in people 's minds , that a decisive majority in the election seemed impossible . The close vote for Congress , in fact , is a fair measure of what was generally expected . However , even while making Congress the caretaker for the conflicts of the past , the American people rose above sectional , class , economic and racial cleavages to give the President a decisive enough majority to deal boldly with the problems of national survival in this war-threatened world . Eisenhower has only to govern in the pat tern of his victory ? by elevating the interests of America as a whole above all domestic factions  --  to be assured the people will follow him in support of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold war . Many persons have been joyous or sad over November 's tidings , depending on how they felt about Roosevelt and the New Deal . To this writer , the exciting thing about Eisenhower 's sweep was its demonstration that our political system is flexible enough ho make the voice of American unity heard above the clamor of the dividing dissensions of the past .
