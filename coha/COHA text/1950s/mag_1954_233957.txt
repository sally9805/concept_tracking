Coriolanus is perhaps Shakespeare 's least popular major play-which is not unfitting , since its Roman hero himself spurned popularity . It is perhaps Shakespeare 's least poetic major play as well ; for Coriolanus , unlike Hamlet or Macbeth , lacks imagination and tragic awareness . But a major play it decidedly is , with a Roman clang and massiveness to its story of a proud patrician hero who is denied the consulate and then banished from the city for not truckling to the plebs , and who joins his former enemies in an expedition against Rome . <P> Whether or not , through Coriolanus , Shakespeare vented his own presumed contempt for the common people , he was by no means taking his hero 's side . The play portrays the fickle , mindless mob as the poor creature of human vanity , but it also exhibits a fiery , mindless Coriolanus as the victim of inhuman pride . Unlike the willful Lear , the willful Coriolanus can not term himself more sinned against than sinning ; also unlike Lear , he is hardened and envenomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pleadings of his mother Volumnia , who , in high Roman fashion , helps doom her child to save her fatherland . <P> Even the fine scene between mother and son is as masculine in its appeal as a trumpet call ; it is the cello note , rather than poetry itself , that is absent from the play . Coriolanus is more Roman and less human , more heroic and less tragic than Julius Caesar or Antony and Cleopatra . Yet that is to describe rather than disparage it . Even with faults of production , this Coriolanus , as staged by Cinema Producer John ( Julius Caesar ) Houseman , makes a procession of graphic scenes . Its greatest weaknesses stem from miscasting . As Coriolanus , Hollywood 's Robert Ryan is never large-statured or deep-fissured enough ; he suggests prep school and Wall Street rather than gens and war . And though a good actress , Mildred Natwick is not a right Volumnia . Yet the play still registers .                 @ @ @ @
