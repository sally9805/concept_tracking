Italy 's muff-haired Domenico Modugno , a guitar-plunking crooner with a gypsy wail , turns out lyrics that make no sense , and he can not read the music he composes and sings . But last year his song Volare ( To Fly ) was the world 's biggest hit , with 7,000,000 records sold , including 2,000,000 for Decca Records in the U.S. alone . Last week Modugno , glowing in a powder-blue tuxedo , weepily twanged his latest effort , Piove ( It 's Raining ) , at the annual San Remo Song Festival , walked off with the festival prize-no cash , but an Oscar-sized honor in a crooner-crazed land . This week Piove , a mawkish tale about lovers parting at a train station , flowed across the U.S. on hot platters pressure-cooked by Decca , is almost sure to be another smash hit for Modugno . He freely admits that his stuff is pure corn-on-the-sob , but happily asks : " Why not ? Is not the heart eternal ? "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
