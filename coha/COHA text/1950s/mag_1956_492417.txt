MY BATTLES 1N WAR AND PEACE : * * * * CONCLUSION : THE KOREAN WAR By GENERAL MATTHEW B. RIDGWAY AS TOLD TO HAROLD H. MARTIN . - - - Talk and happy laughter filled the living room of our dear old friends , the Jaynes . In the pleasant hubbub I could hardly hear the voice at my shoulder , telling me I was wanted on the telephone . It was December ? 22 , 195o . In Washington and at Fort Myer , the undying spirit of Christmas was beginning to glow warmly in men 's hearts . But in Korea , at that moment , a shattered , freezing Army was falling back , by land and sea , before the Red Chinese who were storming across the Yalu . Despite the brief moments of happiness that / had enjoyed with my old friends that evening , that knowledge weighed heavily upon my spirit , for as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations , the fate of this Army was of profound concern to MC . I looked at my watch as I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaited me at that hour , I knew it could not he good . Gen. Joseph Lawton Collins , the Chief of Staff , was on the phone . " Joe speaking , Matt , " he said . " I am sorry to have to tell you this . Johnny Walker has been killed in a jeep accident in Korea . I want you to go out there and take over Eighth Army just as quickly as you can . " Whatever personal implications this message had for me were immediately lost in the deep : pang of sorrow 1 felt at hearing of Lt. Gen. Walton Walker 's death , fur in war and peace , for more than thirty years , he had been my honored comrade and good friend . I went back to the party . Across the room , Penny , my wife , was looking at me with a question in her eyes . I shrugged and smiled as if the call were of no importance . I had already resolved to break no sad news to her that night . Our hours together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few hours away , would be all too soon to strike this blow at the heart of my dearest . If those who impute a love of war to professional soldiers could share just one such experience with a soldier 's family , if they could read what was in his heart when such orders came , they would never again make such accusations . Christmas was almost upon us . Saturday afternoon I had planned to slip away from the Pentagon to buy the tree for my little son , Many , twenty months old . Saturday night we would string the lights and put the presents around , and spend the holiday together ; just the three of us. at home , Now that chance for a happy Christmas was gone . I broke the news to Penny at breakfast that morning as we were having coffee in the little study upstairs . She took it like a soldier . There were no tears , no pleadings for delay , and the thought came to me that no battlefield heroism can compare with a noble woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace . I made a will , executed a power of attorney , provided an allotment for my family 's care . Photographers and reporters came , and after they had gone another photographer came , to make the special picture of my wife and son that would follow me to Korea . Packing was no chore . On a rainy Sunday some weeks before , prompted by tome guidance from above , I had gone up to the attic and laid out all my old combat gear from World War II . Now I packed it in a miscellany of bags and boxes which I considered singularly appropriate for a man who was to take command of a fighting force which depended for its life on interservice team play . There was an old Marine Corps sea bag , from my Nicaragua service in IfT2H ; an Army footlocker from the 9th Infantry , circa 192 ( 3 ; a small steel chest picked up from the Navy when I was commander in chief in the Caribbean in 1949 ; an Air Force grip , stained with the mud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I came home from the Pentagon early that night , to find a tree aglow and the eyes of my little son matching its shining lights . A brother officer , bless him , had found and placed it for me . After dinner we tat for a moment around the tree while Nfatty opened his presents , which he soon abandoned , as children will , for something else  --  a silver cigarette box which he found more entrancing . Penny , my wife , wished to show me what he had learned that day . She started , " Jack and Jill went up the ? " " Hill , " said Matty promptly . " To get a pail of " " Water , " said Matty . And then , " Mary had a little ? " " Goat , " said Many . It was the first good laugh I 'd had that day , the last I was to have for months to come . Two hours later I looked down from my plane , climbing westward into the darkness , I caught a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Matty was in his bed by now , the silver cigarette box beside him . And somewhere , down there in the darkness , Penny was driving home , bravely to face the long hours of loneliness and anxiety a soldier 's wife must endure . Forty hours later , almost to the minute , my fine crew set the big ship down on the airfield at Haneda , hair an hour from Tokyo . On the long Right out I had thought my problems through . Many of the elements of the Army I was to command were still withdrawing by sea from the north . The badly battered 2nd Division , which had borne the brunt of the first Chinese break-through , was still noneffective , refitting in the far south of the peninsula . The itt Marine Division , after its famous " advance in the wrong direction " from Chosin to the-sea , had gone aboard ship at Won-San , and were just coming ashore at Is Imam The Std and 7th divisions were still afloat . Only three American divisions , all greatly reduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24th and 25th divisions were in the line north of Seoul , with the 1st Cavalry in a blocking position to the rear . All the rest of that 195-mile front was held by ROK troops . It seemed to me that the situation was a duplicate , on a grand scale , of similar problems that had been handed to me often in the , service schools , for every young officer is trained to take over in battle in a time of crisis . Many times , in classes at Fort Henning . 1 had worked these things out  --  assuming that the battalion commander had been killed , taking over in his place in the midst of battle . So , as 1 stepped from my plane at Haneda , my basic plans were laid . I would first report to General MacArthur , of course , and get from him the briefing that would bring me fully abreast of the situation in Korea . In Korea my first move would be to visit every commander  --  the corps cornmandcrs first , the division commanders later  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own judgment of their capabilities . Then I would see for myself the terrain where action was taking place . and talk to soldiers and junior atmCCM until I had the " feel " of this Army , had estimated its physical capabilities , and , above all , had assayed its willingness to fight . Once I had this feel of the situation , I would know what to do . General MacArthur received me with the consummate courtesy that has been characteristic of him in all the years I have known him . The briefing he gave me was masterful . When it was finished I had but one question . As I turned to leave , I slopped . " General , " I said , " if , after I make an estimate of the situation over there , I decide to attack , will I have your approval ? " " Matt , " he told me , " the Eighth Anny IS yours . ' ' Warmed by his confidence in mc. feeling a deep conviction that out of this thistle danger we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory , 1 flew to Korea , The first message I wished the lith Army to receive from me was one of profound respect for the indomitable heart of that great soldier , Johnny Walker , whose responsibilities it had become my honored privilege to assume . The next was an expression of my complete faith in the justice of our cause , and in our ultimate victory . 130111 of these 1 expressed . Lev Allen , fah Army 's great thief of staff , had a heart-warming grin of greeting for me as I stepped from my plane onto Korean sail at Taegu . No fuss and feathers . Just a quick handshake and hello , and we were off in a bitter wind that cut through my thin blouse , riding to war once more in the old familiar jeep . Herr ter go again , I thought , as I saw around me men in battle dress and all the machinery and accouterments of war . First the Ardennes and the Bulge . Now Korea , and another massive break-through that must be stopped . turned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be delegated , as authority may be , but individually and ceaselessly mine , day and night , as is every commander 's , from five-star general down to corporal . Command responsibility  --  mine for as long as it may please God and my superiors . What a welcome opportunity ! My first staff conference was brief , for I was eager to be on my way . by air , to my command post at Seoul . And again I met an old friend  --  the B-17 bomber of World War II , With a 127 al home , I climbed over the catwalk through the bomb bay , and crawled on my hands and knees to the bombardier 's cage in die nose . There is no substitute for personal reconnaissance in war . On my orders we flew a roundabout course that covered sixty miles of the front , From 3000 feet above the rugged hills , the deep valleys and the icy paddy fields , I found and marked on a map the line to which we would withdraw , and hold , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insgan the conferences which would give mc the feel of the situalion . Then 1 said my devoirs to President Syngman Rhrc . Looking at that lined , ancient , stubborn face , I knew that here was a man who would stand by us to the last , would fight so long as a Chinese enemy remained on Korean soil . " I am glad you are here , General Ridgway , " he said , putting out his hand . " I am happy to be here , Mr. President , " I said . " And 1 have come to stay . " There was no bombast in that statement . I meant it from the heart . The days that followed were busy ones . From dawn to dark , by jeep and plane , I traveled the front , talking to my commanders . Some things I found filled me with great confidence . A few hours after I landed , Rear Admiral Thackrey , USN , commanding the amphibious forCes that held the sea on our left flank , called on me . His first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you ? " General Partridge , of the Air Force , gave me the same fine support . Their magnificent spirit , manifest from the outset , filled me with complete confidence in the combat performance of the great inierallied service team , no matter what trials might lie ahead . From that time on , I had no anxiety about our control of the air , and I worried no longer about my western flank resting on the sea . Some other things disturbed me . It soon was clear to me that an air of uncertainty , of disquietude , of lack of confidence . prevailcc  --  unong some of the ground-force elements that had been hit so hard . You sense these things the instant you enter a combat zone . You read it in the faces of the first troops you meet , the first MP who gives you directions ; you sense it in the attitude of the men . There is a certain lack of aggressiveness , a withdrawal into themselves . They are reluctant to come forward with information . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the commanding officer , you know what to expect from him when you call him aside , alone , to get his estimate of the situation . For confidence , spirit , purposefulness , aggressiveness flow down from the top and permeate a whole command . And in the same way do anxiety and lack of resolution on the part of a commander put their indelible stamp upon his men , One of the first things that struck me was the location of the 5th Army command post . It was 00 miles behind the battle front , at Taegu . I stayed there just one night . Then I flew on up to Seoul , where the advance CP was located . I found only a handful of staff officers there , where most of them shook I have been . in my first visits I made few pointed criticisms . The first thing to do with either a man or an army which has lost its spirit is to try to restore confidence . My first talks therefore , were in the nature of exhortations . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fighting capabilities of their men . Then I began to get down to brass tacks . I told them that I had learned in my military primer , and 1 assumed they had learned the same lesson , that Ihe first role in war is to make contact with your enemy  --  physical contact  --  and once that contact is made , it must not be lost . So I ordered them immediately to begin aggressive scouting and patrolling , reconnoitcring all the area to their front . Second , they were woefully lacking in knowledge of the terrain . I told them I did n't want to ask any soldier or officer where a road or trail went and have him tell me he did n't know . It was his business to know the ground to his front . It was his business to know what kind of vegetation was there for cover , whether a tank could operate there or not , what concealment the land offered to an enemy . Next was the use of firepower . All through my service , in school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard corrunanders hollering for help When they were not using more than To per Peru of the total firepower that was available to them . As soon as I landed in Korea I had asked ? Vashington to rush delivery of WI new battalions of artillery . When these guns were in place , I wanted them used . I wanted everything used  --  artillery , armor , antiaircraft guns , mortars , machine guru , and every rifle in the line  --  every time the Chinese came at them . I then spoke about leadership . The power and prestige of America were at stake here , I told them , and some of our fighting forebears would turn over in their graves if they 'd heard some of the stories I had heard . The place of a commander was up where the crisis of action was taking place . A division commander should spend his days up with his battalions in the line . A corps commander should be up with his forward regiments . Paper work was irn ? portant , but it could be done at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting was going on . I had found in some units an appalling lack of initiative . An infantry company commander told me hr could n't communicate with another coin . puny in his battalion because his radio was out . I told him men in battle had kept con. tact with each other long before radios weir invented , and he could do the same . If his radio was out and a vehicle could n't cross the intervening terrain , then a good strong pair of legs could make it , and I wanted them used . In the first few days it had become clear to me , from the fragmentary information I could get , that the Chinese were massing for a strong attack . I figured it would COM just at the New Year . Soon after my arrival , therefore , I asked President Rhee to make available to me 30,000 native laborers . We equipped them with picks and shovels , and set them to constructing trench defenses and log barriers along the line we then held , and a deeper position some teen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended this army should make its stand , and from which it would not budge , except in counterattack . At noon on the thirty-first of December I told Lev Allen , my chief of staff . that 1 was moving from Taegu up to Seoul . I would slay there until the attack that I expected to ( VIM within the next twelve hours , had struck us or it became clear that my esti ? mate had been wrong . I got there at two o'clock . I immediately got into a jeep and began to tour the front , riding the lonely hills , checking that thin line of helve men who held the front north of the Han . I 'll never forget one young British finales-ant I found late in the afternoon , on a gale-swept hill . I asked him if there was anything I could do for him . Not a thing , thanks very much , he said . Then , as I turned to go , he smiled . " It is a bit drafty up here , sir , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of front to cover with a handful of men . struck . afte . They d y came that othide iinvasionice osn route , the main road leading south toward Seoul . They hit the Holy Infantry , on the right flank of the ' 2 t h Division , and drove hard against the ROK division beside them . They broke through , and for a while there we had an interesting military prole lem on our hands  --  the problem of whether or not I Corps and IX Corps could hold . Three days before , we had perfected plans to take care of any kind 01 action that might come . 11Ve had anticipated an attack in strength beyond our power at that moment to withstand . and had made plans for withdrawal on my order . For thirty-six hours the battle flared there , the pressure building up steadily , the Chinese breaking through all along that thinly held I95-mile line . Flying the front in a light plane , dropping down to talk with commanders in the line , at midmorning an January third , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation of Seoul , with its 1,000,00o refugees . It meant also carrying out the most dangerous of military maneuvers  --  the withdrawal across the ice-dogged Han of all the men and guns that lay to the north of the river . The Han , as it flows past Seoul , is a big river , as wide and deep as the Potomac where it flows past Washington . It is tidal up to the floating bridges that span the river at Seoul , and at the time it was partially frozen solid , partially tilled with great cakes of floating ice . The withdrawal of that fighting force across the Han and the flight of hundreds of thousands of refugees with them will live forever in the memory of those who witnmed it . In an endless stream , bumper to bumper , the guns and the trucks rolled over those floating bridges , steadily . hour after hour . I stood on the frozen bank and watched those heavy pietas of equipment roll by , and watched the bridges sink beneath the weight of those huge tanks and 8-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of us did , that the bridges ss ould hold . In boats alongside the bridges . engineers poked and shoved with side poles , keeping the broken ice floes moving , for an ice jam there would have carried the bridge away and cut us off beyond all hope of rescue . Off to the sides , on the solid ice , one of the great human tragedies of modern times was being enacted . Hundreds of thousands of Koreans jammed in great masses along the riverbanks and poured in steady streams across the frozen river . Two-wheeled carts , ponies . oxcarts , men and women with great burdens on their backs were fleeing in panic before the advancing enemy , It is a sight I shall remember as long as I live , Old men , sonic of them so feeble they seemed hardly able to stand , mothers with solemn , wide-eyed babies shawl-wrapped upon their barks stumbled blindly southward through that dreadful cold . Now and then an ox or pony would go down , all four legs asprawl . The mass flowed on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor . Panting , half running , falling , they pushed on . Watching them , t thought of our own people . How could a soft , ease-loving population like ours survive such hardships and such cold ? What would our people do if ever they should hear the guns of a dreadful enemy thundering behind them , and saw an icy wilderness before them ? How would they survive , if some man with a rifle ordered them out of their automobiles and sent them on trails over the hills , barring them from highways that were open only to military traffic ? There is a lesson for us here , in the terrible problems that would arise if we should ever have to evacuate one of our own great cities . The attack had come two hours after sundown , on New Year 's Eve . All that night , reports of the collapse of the ROK st and 6th divisions poured into my CP . At dawn on New Year 's Day I set out by jeep , with a driver and one rifleman , to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headlong rush to the rear . r1 few miles north of Seoul the first wave hit me . Afoot and in trucks to jam-packed another small boy could not have found room in them , they were moving south toward Seoul as fast as they could roll . They had abandoned all their crew-served weapons , and all but a few of them had thrown their rifles away . I blocked the road with my jeep to halt the column , and then tried to find their ulTircrs , whom I could identify by their insignia . I 'd never had such an experience before , and I hope I never do again , for trying to stop a running army is like trying to stop an avalanche . I spoke no Korean . They spoke no English . But they understood my gestures , and I would n't have been surprised if some of them had opened up on this lone foreigner who stood between them and safety , I soon saw that it was impossible to stop them at that point . A retreating force in full flight builds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The best you can do is to try to slow it down , channel it toward an assembly area , and halt it there , blocking its way with MP straggler posts . Once troops are out of the danger zone and their panic has been allayed , you can get them in hand , rearm them , get some spirit 1 30 in them and turn them around to fight . That we did . We slopped both corps abreast , on the line I had already chosen , fifteen miles south of the Han . In the task of preparing this force to fight again , I had great help from brave old Syngman Rhce . He knew my feelings about his troops . Tragic as their break had been , I could not find it in my heart to blame them . These ROK divisions had been mauled as few armies in history had been mauled . They had been practically decimated in the early months of the war . Their leaders had been killed or captured . and officers now commanding divisions had no more experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were green and it was no great wonder to me that they had been overwhelmed . Iknew also that with proper leadership and inspiration they could be turned into a fighting force again . For this help I called on President Rhcc . At my invitation , he flew with me to talk to them and try to restore in them their will to light . Our plane was an old World War 11 Cub , a tiny in  --  sect of a plane , with a canvas fuselage and no heat in it whatsoever . The old gentleman flew in his native costume , a long kimono . He did n't even have a scarf at his neck , and at the altitude we had in fly , the temperatures were freezing . He never uttered a word of complaint . We flew to those ROK units and he addressed them in fiery fighting words . I could not understand what he said , but he put the iron back in their souls , and I am sure his efforts played a great part in restoring their fighting heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easy to pull back . Troops do not like to give ground , and commanders do not like to require it . But all along the front , wherever the Chinese had pressed us , we had inflicted heavy casualties . We had achieved maximum delay . We had stood and fought , with an icy , unfordable river at our backs , until it was time to go . As I was putting my fcw personal belongings in my musette bag , I found that the lower part of my one pair of flannel pajamas had seen better days . It was split beyond repair in the upper posterior region  --  due , I hasten to add , entirely to fair wear and tear in the Government 's service . My orderly wanted it for a shoe rag , but there was a better use for it than that . We tacked it up on my office wall , the torn and worn-out seat flapping forlornly in the wind . Above it , I printed in block letters : TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL , CIIINESE COMMUNIST FORCES . WITI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That little chore done , I moved out with the troops . On the ridge lines fifteen miles to the south of the Han , we took our stand and waited . The Chinese did not follow . Hastily , with thousands of laborers working , we organized the ground , laid out fields of lire and emplaced the big guns . From there we began probing north , feeling for the enemy . We started with small patrols , reinforced them to battalion size , and added artillery and armor until these reinforced battalions were punching out in front of each division zone . Offensive action bred an offensive spirit . We built up these probing attacks to a regimental combat team within each division ; then to a division within each corps . We met spotty resistance , weak in some areas , strong in others . And all that my intelligence-gathering agencies could show me was a big goose egg out front , with " 1 7+ Off ) Chinese " written in red in the middle of it . I did n't believe that figure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trap . As a last resort , with Lieutenant General Partridge . commander of the 5th Air Force , at the controls of a two-seater plane , we made a long reconnaissance , twenty miles into enemy territory . We flew below the ridge tops , peering down at every snowy village , every trail . To toy amazement , over all that area I saw only one indication of troops , a spider web of cart and foot tracks leading from a village into a pine-clad valley , We swept the valley back and forth , but saw nothing stirring . Everywhere the land looked empty and dead , with no wisp of smoke rising from the chimneys and no movement of men and vehicles on the roads . The Chinese arc masters at concealment , though , and I knew I still did not have my answers . There was just one way to find out what was in there . We would attack . On the morning of January twenty-fifth , the ftth Army jumped off in an assault that rolled on , and on , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38th parallel . It was hard lighting all the way . Those still , dead-looking villages and snow-dad hills had concealed thousands of Chinese , and they fought with fanatir courage . In mid-Februar ? , side-stepping to the cast , they launched an attack of their own , striking the end Division a savage blow . This gave us pause , momentarily , but the break was soon sealed oil , and the drive to the north rolled on . It was still rolling on the eleventh of April when , standing on a hill in a sleet and snow storm , I received the message that General MacArthur had been relieved . For several hours , without my knowing it , I had been Supreme Commander , Allied Powers , Far East , responsible for the protection and defense of a theater sprawled in a great arc from Formosa to the western tip of the Aleutians . The next morning I flew to Tokyo . General MacArthur received me at once . He was entirely himself  --  composed , quiet , temperate , courteous and helpful . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summarily relieved , but there was no bitterness , no anger , in his tone . I thought it was a fine tribute to the resilience of this great man that he could accept so calmly , without outward sign of shock , what must have been a devastating blow to a professional soldier standing at the peak of a great career . The dispute as to who was right and who was wrong in that particular incident will rage , no doubt , so lung as the principals involved survive . Our whole policy in Korea , in fact , both military and political , will be a question for historians to debate . My own conviction is that the magnificent 8th Army could have driven the Chinese beyond the Yalu  --  if this country had been willing to pay the price in lives such action would have cost . Personally , 1 strongly doubt that such a victory would have been worth the cost  --  particularly in light of the fact that our Government seemed to have no firm policy on what steps to take thereafter . Seizure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been merely the seizure of more real estate . It would have greatly shortened the enemy 's supply lines and greatly lengthened our own . It would have widened our front from I to miles to inn , and beyond that front would lie Manchuria and the whole mainland of Asia , in which all the wealth and manpower of this country could have been lost and dissipated . So it is useless to speculate on what might have been . I was not privy to the councils of our leaders at home when they decided to accept the Russian-sporisortid overtures for a truce . But in retrospect I do not feel constrained to quarrel with that decision . I left Korea feeling a great admiration and respect for that great , high-hearted army that had come out of the depths of military disaster to turn on its enemy and defeat him . 1 thought then , and I think now , that the United States never fielded an army as competent , tough , as high spirited , as was the 8th Army when the truce talks halted it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spiritual and moral sense as I am of the military prowess it displayed . I remember One night spent at a battle command pm deep in the snow-covered hills up front . I had far to go next day , and I was up before a trace of dawn . It was almost zero . The stars snapped and sparkled in a dead black sky . A few campfires were burning , casting the leaping shadows of soldiers ' silhouettes across the gleaming snow . As I stood there these thoughts crossed my mind : Here in this bit of far-off earth , cupped in by foreign hills , there burns a warm bright flame , lit and nurtured by free men , whose frigid bodies it warmed and whose spirits it raised and comforted . Beyond its warming circle , I thought , the eyes and souls of other men and women and little children , silent and hungry and cold , must see its glow and yearn for its warmth . Must wonder , as they yearned : Will these strange , generous men , determined killers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let this fire languish and die ? Will they keep faith and fire burn . ing until the sun of freedom rises once more , and we can take up our toil again in honor . able peace ? Or will they , in the hour of decision , fail and forsake us ? All over the world , hopeful millions still ask these questions of us . We gave them our answer in Korea and the Far East . We gave them our answer in Europe . Thcrc is peace in Europe today because the NATO armies  --  which I commanded after leaving Tokyo  --  stand on guard there . And the NATO armies arc there for one reason only  --  because this nation , for the first time in its history , recognized the fact that only our own strength  --  the strength of armed men standing face to face with the foe  --  could save the world from another lidocaust . The core and heart of that armed force are our own soldiers and airmen . ItS'ithout them , there would never have been a NATO . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to the degree that we weaken those forces , to that degree we weaken NATO . We did not make any pledge that we would keep these forces in being on the continent of Europe forever . But in our presence the promise is implicit that we shall remain there , in strength , until time and diplomacy and the slow proc ? eases of civilization can create an atmosphere of peace . In all my service as Su. premc Commander there , and as Supreme Commander in the Far East , and as Chid of Staff , I have clone all within my power insure that we should not forget these obligations : that we should not forsake the enduring values which free men cherish , that we should not relinquish , in even slight degree , our power to defend them if war again should engulf the world . The time has not yet conic when we cart relax our guard , no matter how the political winds that blow from the Kremlin may shift and vary . The issues between to and our enemy have not changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc , for the moment , still . The real issue still is simply this : Whether the power of Western civilization , as God has permitted it to flower in our own beloved land , shall defy and defeat communism , or whether , through our ova/ weakness , we shall perish in the despair and misery of a Godless world . To me the choice is , and always has been clear . We arc , as Lincoln said of us , the last , best hope of earth . And with all the strength of all our arms  --  land , sea and air  --  we must stand ready to defend ourselves and all men everywhere who share our dream of a free and peaceful world .
