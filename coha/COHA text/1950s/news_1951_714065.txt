txt BERLIN REDS CURB YOUTH TRIPS WEST Close ' 12 Key Transit Stations in an Effort to Keep Rally Delegates in East Sector By DREW MIDDLETON Special IO Tun NEW YORK Taus . BERLIN , Aug , ** German Communist Government closed twelve key stations on the elevated and subway system f East Berlin tonight as part of its hasty efforts to halt the mass contact of participants in the youth festival with the peace and comparative prosperity of West Berlin . The action was taken on a direct order from the Soviet Control Commission , according to an authoritative Allied source . It followed several others intended to check the daily migration of tens of thousands of German and East European youths into the free sectors of the city , During the last six days it has been estimated that at least 200 , - 000 Communist youths have traveled from East to West Berlin , most of them through the closed stations , to get a taste of freedom and what is absolute luxury to them , after days of sleeping on straw and eating catch-as-catchcan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Police were drawing a cordon across the streets leading from East to West Berlin , the People 's Police force , used to keep the Communist youths in East Berlin , had been reinforced heavily and three senior officers of the force // had been added to the Organization Committee of the festival . The reason put forward by the East German Government for closing the twelve stations over the week-end was that there would be heavy traffic on those lines during that period , which will see the climax of the youth festival Sunday in the shape of a monster peace parade . Piecing together Allied reports and statements by German and East European delegates to the rally , it is clear that the Russians , who have been running the whole show behind the facade of German youth and student organizations , suddenly have become aware that the whole purpose of the festival is being vitiated by the movenent of the young people into West Berlin . More than 1,100 of them have atked for asylum in West Berlin since the . festival began . Only fifty-one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was threatened because of their anti-Communist activity . This is not many out of the total participation to date of more than 750,000 and it is unlikely that the Russians are unduly worried over it . They are worried , however , by the contact the youths are making with the quiet and , to them , abundant life of West Berlin . According to the orders they have given the East German Government the Russians are far more concerned over this than over the recurrent breakdowns of the supply and transportation arrangements that have produced steadily mounting discontent among the youth festival participants . Seek to Separate Delegates They are making special efforts to keep the delegates from the East European satellite countries , particularly those from Poland , Czechoslovakia and Hungary , away from all contact not only with West Berlin but with the delegates of France , Britain , Italy and other Western countries . " It is a strange idea of friendship , " said a young Czechoslovak tractor driver who had sought and had received asylum in West Berlin . " Apparently they do not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will open our eyes . Mine were opened but I was lucky , I got away . " The Russians ordered squads of the People 's Police to doff their uniforms and wander into the Western sectors last night to spy on Communist sight-seers there . Since it is difficult to disguise a policeman , thirty-one of them were identified and arrested by the West Berlin police . They were released tonight . Members of the satellite delegations to the festival were warned not to talk to Western delegates when they arrived . All were forbidden to bring passports with them . The instructions given by the Russians to the police " guides " for the Eastern delegates indicate an almost pathological fear on the part of Soviet authorities that these young people will somehow obtain a standard of comparison in Germany by which the misery of their own homelands can be measured . A number of those who have defected to the West have stated flatly that living conditions in East Germany and East Berlin , not to mention West Berlin , are far better than in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
