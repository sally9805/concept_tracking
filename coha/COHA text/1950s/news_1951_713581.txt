Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The great need for elevated express highways across Manhattan to alleviate traffic congestion is self-evident . In recent months another strong argument for their prompt construction has arisen . This one deals with civil defense . After an atomic burst fires break out over a wide area from ground point zero . Winds of gale force immediately follow the explosion , thus helping to create raging conflagrations which devour everything in their path . Therefore broad fire breaks bisecting congested city areas become as imperative as they are in fighting forest fires . These lanes may well afford the sole means for entering a devastated area by rescue parties and demolition squads . They may provide the only possible paths for quick evacuation of thousands who otherwise may become trapped and encircled by fire . New York City has for some time past been giving consideration to the construction of two elevated express highways across Manhattan . The Borough President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , in order to connect the Holland Tunnel with the Williamsburg and Manhattan Bridges . The other one is planned to traverse Thirtieth Street for the purpose of joining the Lincoln and the Queens Midtown Tunnels . The present arrangements contemplate building these vital vehicular links in the center of these thoroughfares , which are to be widened from 60 feet to 160 feet . Data from the most reliable sources seem to indicate that this width is not sufficient to create real fire breaks . Two hundred feet is reported to be the absolute safe minimum under present city conditions . Three hundred feet would be infinitely better . Therefore , wherever it is at all possible , these measurements should be adhered to . Naturally , such ? an enlarged widening would greatly increase the cost of condemnation . The Civil Defense Bill , now pending in Congress , in many of its provisions is not entirely realistic . It requires states and municipalities to match federal contributions dollar with dollar on all civil defense projects . New York City has now no such funds available and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority , aided by the Port of New York Authority , offered to build the Thirtieth Street Elevated Highway , relying on tolls , parking spaces and commercial concessions to finance and operate it , without adding to the taxpayers ' burden . The Federal Government at that time agreed to put up $900,000 for planning and engineering . Unfortunately , this initial attempt was drowned in a sea of circumlocution . It might be well to resuscitate this constructive proposal at the present time , strengthened as it now is by a justifiable and urgent civil defense need . Federal financial aid might be forthcoming , this time in a sufficient amount to pay not only for the engineering costs but also for the enlarged widening needed for civil defense purposes . Certainly the matter should be thoroughly explored and all possible influence brought to bear on Congress to redraft the present bill so as to make possible such vital projects , The same formula can be applied to the Broome Street Thruway , maybe substituting the newly created Parking Authority in lieu of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner , City Planning Commission . New York , Feb : 6 , 1951 . Ban on " Oliver Twist " Queried To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : All the fuss about " The Miracle " recalls to me the keen disappointment I have felt since first learning , more than a year ago , that audiences here were not to be permitted to see " Oliver Twist . " Because it has been one of the enduring stories of youth , because it was produced by the same organization that gave us the superb " Great Expectations , " because Charles Dickens has never yet been equaled by Hollywood , " Oliver Twist " has a right to be seen . I am astonished at the relative calm in which a classic was permitted to be consigned to oblivion . Here was a cause worthy of all the high-flown principles that are now being employed . in defense of a work about whose value no one is quite certain . If those who wish to see " The Miracle " can see it , the same privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twist . " BETTY HAMILTON GIVEN . Chatham , N. J. , Feb. 6 , 1951 . Elevated Highways Urged Civil Defense Believed to Offer Added Argument in Their Favor Labor 's Stand Criticized To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was never one to defend the National Association of Manufacturers in their activities to promote their socalled selfish interests , but condoned them as being a desire to protect and promote their property and finances under the Constitution as they interpreted it . A new bugaboo of the man in the street has arisen in the last decade in the form of labor unions through their leaders . The monopolistic tendencies of this group must of necessity be controlled as well as those of capital interests . Your newspaper for several weeks has rendered news reports of price and wage controls . Searching through these reports I have endeavored to find one instance of a labor leader 's advocating the fixing of wages as well as prices . How can any intelligent human being expect to do away with the black market of World War II by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , most leaders of industry have requested the control of both wages and prices . If labor leaders wish to retain the goodwill of the man on the street they must act not only for the selfish interests of their individual unions but also for the best interests of the common man . G. L 's in Korea are fighting for the future of this nation , and for all it represents . They are not concerned with enriching with their lives either the N. A. M. or the labor unions . NATHAN GOTTLIEB . Rockville Centre , N. Y. , Feb. 3 , 1951 . Spending for Peace Funds Advocated for Increased Human Happiness Instead of War To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : During my lifetime I have lived through two wars , the first " to save the world for democracy , " the second " to destroy nazism , fascism and Tojoism . " We " won " both wars , but we still have not " saved the world for democracy " nor have we " destroyed fascism . " Our President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly for military spending , and if we have war we shall undoubtedly spend three or four times that sum . Supposing we " win " this war , wo n't the poverty , chaos and confusion which will follow insure the destruction of capitalism and the survival of communism , since capitalism lives on prosperity and communism lives on poverty ? In its truly idealistic conception , communism stands for " the community , " and capitalism represents " free enterprise  --  opportunity . " Can there be no compatibility between " the community " and " opportunity " ? it seems to me that it is only the evil in both of these " isms " that is causing our conflict . It is only the insistence of both capitalists and Communists on imposing their " isms " on the rest of the world , with or without the consent of the rest of the world , that is causing these conflicts and misunderstandings . We are going to spend $71,000,000,000 this year for defense , and that is right because we have to be strong . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four times $71 , - 000,000,000 . Would n't we be better advised to spend these sums for peace , for a bigger and better Marshall Plan , fora world pact instead of an Atlantic Pact ? The spending of these huge sums of money to raise the living standards of the whole world , including those of Russia and its satellites , would seem to be more logical . The spending of these huge sums of money to save lives would seem to be more humane . The spending of these huge sums of money for the promotion of democracy would seem to be much better insurance than the continuance of spending them for war , which , at least in our last two experiences , has proved nothing . I and my fellow-Americans are very confused and very worried . I am sure that we would like a movement started for the promotion of the ideas outlined above  --  a movement to which we would all give our time , effort and enemy . DAVID SILBERMAN . New York , Feb. 5 , 1951 . Celebrating Inventions To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retired proofreader , 71 years of age . I write to try to interest you in a national Inventors ' Day . On Inventors ' Day we could celebrate the inventions and the inventors of the past . Each year we could consider some particular invention : the wheel or the window this year ; the telephone or the steam engine next year ; then , perhaps , the brick or the hammer . By this alternation of ancient and modern we would arouse the inventive quality in our nation and prepare it for changing times . Of course , our lecturers and celebrators would choose their ' own topics to discuss . I am especially interested in social invention and see great hopes in the idea of Inventors ' Day . The celebration would develop the element of gratitude and continuity in the minds of the electorate and inspire them to greater efforts . Our psychologists are , unfortunately , a flop in this field . H. D. PYOTT . Lancaster , Pa. , Feb. 2 , 1951.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
