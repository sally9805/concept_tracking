Ugetsu ( Daiei ) . Five Japanese films have won grand prizes at International Film Festivals in Cannes and Venice since the war : Rashomon was the first to be shown in this country ; Ugetsu is the second , and in many ways it is a jewel of intenser ray than Rashomon . Rashomon was orgiastic , almost Western in its rage for the things of the world . Ugetsu is contemplative in the midst of violence , wholly Oriental in its lidded introspection . As a result , its beauty and its meaning are more remote from Western audiences , but not too remote . <P> <P> The story of Ugetsu comes from a Japanese classic , written in 1768 by Akinari Ueda . In the closing years of the 16th century , in a time of civil war , a country potter sees his chance to get rich quick selling pots in the city at war-inflated prices . The trip to the city , through a countryside full of marauding soldiery , is insanely dangerous . Halfway , the potter sends his wife and son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no sooner is the money in hand than the potter begins to dream of luxury . <P> All at once the beautiful Lady Wakasa , attended by a dark old woman , appears , and asks him to bring some pottery to her house . He follows . She brings him tea ; she offers him love . He can not resist . " I never imagined such pleasures existed ! " he cries . " You are my slave , " she murmurs . At long last , a Buddhist priest frees the potter from her spell , and he turns back homeward . When he reaches home , he finds his wife dead . Only her spirit is there to comfort him , saying , " Go back to work . " <P> Ugetsu is intended not as a story of real life , but as a fateful legend of the soul . Therefore , the actors keep closer than they did in Rashomon to the old symbolic style . If the greedy peasants grunt and draggle their arms like apes , it is not to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rather that they assumed such attitudes in their hearts . In these terms , the painted mincing of the Lady Wakasa ( Machiko Kyo , the rape victim in Rashomon ) , the snuffling animality of the potter ( Masayuki Mori , the husband in Rashomon ) , the abstract dutifulness of the potter 's wife satisfy the spectator as keenly as gestures in a well-made ballet . <P> The introverted mood of the picture is uncannily enhanced by the musical score . The cold , otherworldly picking of the samisen snips the threads of reality one by one , and the audience floats free among music that tries to express the intimate noises of the toiling spirit . The photography never once permits this mood to falter . Even the most violent scenes are dissolved in a meditative mist , like terrors in the mind of a sage . The moviegoer has the sense of living in a classic Japanese watercolor or of walking on a world that is really a giant pearl .                @ @ @ @ @
