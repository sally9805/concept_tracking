txt A big-time dopester of betting odds on contests ranging from Presidential elections to horse races told a Senate investigating subcommittee today , in effect , that the Administration 's proposed move to put bookmakers out of business would fail . James J. Carroll of St. Louis was the witness before the group , headed by Senator Ernest W. , Democrat of Arizona . The subcommittee is holding hearings on recommendations by J. Howard , Attorney General , that racing and other betting information be barred from crossing state lines . In betting quarters on all fronts , Mr. Carroll is called the " Mr. Big " at setting odds . He is a distinctly middle-size man , mild in appearance , precisely tailored and gazes calmly through rimless eyeglasses . His voice does not carry far . He has been in the betting business , he said , for some forty to fortyfive years , having gone into it from high school . If the Federal Government wants to hurt the bookmaker , Mr. Carroll testified , it could n't do it through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookmaking even more prosperous , as // it would eliminate the bookmaking competition from outside a state . " That , " he said , " is an extremely competitive business , even within the confines of a single city . " Mr. Carroll testified under a promise by Senator that the committee was simply seeking information . It was not alleging , he emphasized , that any violation of Federal or state law had been committed by any witness . Nor , he added , was it looking for violations . Mr. Carroll was frank , up to a point . When some of his trade secrets were suggested for exposure he waited and related them , with committee permission , in closed session . In empilasizing that , in his opinion , the committee was on the wrong tack in a war upon interstate bookmaking , Mr. Carroll made a suggestion . He was asked by Senator Charles W. Tobey , Republican of New Hampshire , just what he would do if he were a Senator and felt that something should be done to curb or halt widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I would suggest that the parimutuel betting that is permitted at racetracks be extended to those in such legalized betting areas who can not go to the racetracks . It could be done through an establishment of ' branch offices ' of the main betting areas . " Denies Link to Crime Mr. Carroll appeared to concentrate on what he viewed as conclusions in Congress that racetrack gambling in particular had formed a nation-wide syndicate that was allied with periodic outbreaks of murder and other crimes in big cities . He said : " I can state without any mental reservation that I know of no such syndicate , combination or organization . To the contrary , it is my firm belief that all of the accepting and laying-off of bets ( a hedging of wagers when risks look too high ) is conducted on a purely competitive basis . " There is no relationship between the operators , commissioners or whatever they may be called in any given city , with those of another city . " It is the considered opinion of persons in this business who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection whatsoever between individuals engaged in gambling , bookmaking , accepting bets , brokers or commissioners , and any of the forms of crime that have been the subject of concern to us within the recent years . " Cites Pre-Wire Betting As to the Attorney General 's proposal , Mr. Carroll indicated that the committee was apparently overlooking the fact that bookmaking on horseracing thrived long before the wire and telephone information services now under attack were set up . Up until 1925 or 1926 , Mr. Carroll said , he had no such service . He expressed an opinion that there was more horserace betting through bookmakers then than now . The witness said that the local bookmaker could set his own odds and take bets at will . True , he conceded , the bettors and the betaccepters would suffer more anxiety while awaiting returns through other mediums of information as to how their bets turned out , if fast-service interstate wires were banned . But , he held , the bets would not diminish , even so . The business of setting odds , Mr. Carroll indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he called himself  --  was to prosper . Members of the committee appeared to be at a loss as to how a man in such a position could " make money . " Apparently not to entire committee satisfaction , Mr. Carroll explained that in the Presidential election of 1948 he had arranged odds both ways , but in favor of President Truman 's victory . The odds , he said , had run something like this : 8 to 1 on Truman ; but with a lay-off bet of around 20 , if Truman should lose . Dewey , he said , was about 1 to 15 , with that bet hedged similarly . When a less confusing example was requested , Mr. Carroll observed that he would be willing to bet , for instance , 2% to 1 that the horse Your Host would not win the Kentucky Derby . He added that he also would bet , 3% to 1 . that that California entry would win the classic . " The effect of wire service is of no importance in betting , " Mr Carroll told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amount wagered or the regularity of bets . " " You , I take it , " interposed Senator , " are an opponent of this proposed bill . " " It is a matter of complete indifference to me , " Mr. Carroll said .
