" Monsieur le Maire , " protested the great hero modestly , " this is really too much honor . . . " But the mayor and all the citizens of Bernay who gathered in the town hall on that broiling day of August 1948 laughed aside the protest with proud , tolerant smiles . Too much honor ? For Roger Touchard , the champion marksman of two continents , the local boy who had made good ? Too much ? " Ah , tell me , Touchard , " said one of the local dignitaries , " what would you say to a red ribbon in your coat , the Cross of the Legion of Honor ? What would you say to that , eh ? " Roger merely gasped . <P> It was a great moment for 39-year-old Roger . As a boy , under the nickname Bbert ( " Dopey " ) , he had always been something of a joke . When he tried pole vaulting , the bamboo splintered . When he tried to throw the hammer , it fell on his toe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ankle . " Poor Bbert , " laughed the villagers of Favril , his boyhood home . They did not know that secretly Roger was reading up on sports , determined to become a champion . " Father , " he said one day in 1946 , " I 'm leaving for Versailles . There 's a big rifle-shooting contest on there , and I 'm entering . " <P> Marksman Who Missed . Moved and touched , the elder Touchard gave his son money for the journey , and eight days later was rewarded with the news , borne by returning Roger himself , that he had won the contest . " I have smashed the world 's record , " said Roger . " Bbert ! " cried his father , and hurried out to tell the neighbors . <P> After that , things went from better to better for Bbert . In the next three years he left town several times , only to return with news of even greater triumphs . At shooting matches in Amsterdam , Lisbon , London and Toronto , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents to include not only rifles but pistols . The local girls flung themselves at his feet , and after a time , Roger married one of the richest of them and moved to the bigger town of Bernay . There the local shooting club welcomed him with open arms and were only slightly put out when Roger missed the target completely at his first shoot . " I suppose , " said one member , " that he did n't want to embarrass us . " Soon afterward Roger resigned , to assume the presidency of what he called the International Federation of Professional Marksmen . <P> Ticker-Tape Triumph . Two years ago Roger left Bernay once more-bound , he said , for some great shooting matches in Chicago and New York . He returned with a lyric description of the ticker-tape reception accorded him on New York 's lower Broadway . " Never , " he said , " shall I forget that delirious welcome , " and the applause that greeted the words in Bernay was deafening . After that , it was a cinch . On Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ' activity in the field of sport , " Roger Touchard had been named Chevalier of the Legion of Honor .
