txt At the moment of this writing the world crisis can be summarized as ' follows : The Soviet Union has restored ? its military grip on Eastern Europe and has become for the moment an insistent and threatening influence in the Middle East . It has done this by the exercise of overwhelming military power in Hungary and by the threat of the use of " volunteers " in the Middle East and a hint of willingness to use " rockets " against Britain . The United States , the only other military power in the world which could challenge the power of the Soviet Union , has declined to use its force or a direct threat of use of its force to counterbalance the use of force by Moscow . Instead , it has pursued a policy of trusting to the United Nations both to secure a respite for the anguish of Hungary and to keep Soviet " volunteers " out of the Mid , - dle East . The United States policy of relying on the UN could be effective if the Soviet Union were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it has refused to permit the UN even to inspect conditions in Hungary on the ground that what happens there is a " domestic " matter . As for the Middle East , it was partly the threat of Soviet " volunteers " which caused Britain , Israel , and France to agree to a cease-fire before they had completed their intended military operations . It is pointed out hopefully by some that only the Moscow radio , not the Moscow Foreign Office , threatened to use Soviet force against Britain outside ' the UN . This is true , but it overlooks the fact that it was the implied threat which in fact restored President Nasser 's threatened positi , 1 in the Middle East , made him an instrument of Soviet policy in his area , and brings Moscow today into the decisions which determine the amount of Middle Eastern oil which can flow to Western Europe  --  and the price . The essential feature of this is that Moscow , by . acting outside the UN and employing its own force either in fact , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Middle East , has restored its threatened military position in Eastern Europe and is uncomfortably close , for the West , to realizing its 200-year-old dream of authority in the Middle East . This is the most spectacular and threatening exercise of the Soviet Union in power politics since the passing of Stalin . This situation is not , of necessity , permanent . But it is difficult to see how it can be redressed when the United States plays inside the UN under UN rules against a power which plays outside the UN by its own rules . The United States wants tO meet this danger , as it met the threat in Korea , under the aegis of the UN . But the UN sanction for United States action in Korea was obtained by a vote in the Security Council at a time when the Soviet Union was absent , This will not be repeated . In theory the United States could obtain a similar sanction from the General Assembly of the UN . But a two-thirds vote is required in the Assembly . It is obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of United States force to keep Soviet " volunteers " out of the Middle East could not obtain a two-thirds majority . Too many Asian and Arab nations would vote with Egypt  --  and hence with the Soviet Union . The position of the United States is morally impeccable and legally exemplary . It can revert to direct , individual action anytime it wishes without violating the Charter . But until such time , the American position hobbles and neutralizes the - power of the only country in the world with enough power to call the Soviet bluff , if it be a bluff , or meet it with force if it is not a bluff . As long as the United States plays the game under UN rules and Moscow does not , Moscow can use its force to gain its ends , as it has done with such shattering success in Hungary and the Middle East . It incurs moral odium in the process , but it also gains its ends . The country willing to risk war enjoys an overwhelming advantage over those who seek peace and are unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace is an absolute policy , there comes a time when it can be implemented only by surrender to those willing to risk war . Suez has long been and still remains the most important strategic crossroad in the world . The control of that crasroad carries with it today control of the flow of oil to Western Europe , without which European economy can not function . Colonel Nasser , the ally and prot  --  g ? of Moscow , has been able to stop the flow through all but one of the Middle East pipelines by his influence over the other Arab countries . If British and French troops are forced to leave Suez under his terms , he will have regained effective control of the canal itself . Moscow has the beginnings of a military base in Syria and could move 50 , - 000 " volunteers " into the area to consolidate the base . The only surely visible means at this moment for changing this situation is United States force , which under existing policy can be used only under a UN sanction which would require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
