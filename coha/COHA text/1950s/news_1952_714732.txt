txt Up the broad waters of Hampton Roads tonight moved the superliner United States with an outsized I broom riding on a mast high above the decks . It was the first time in this century that a liner under the flag of the United States ? could lay claim to being the fastest in the world . Returning from her successful official.ocean trials , the 990-foot liner carried the traditional sailor 's sign that she had " swept the seas " and had achieved a speed record . During a sustained power rim last night at 158,000 horsepower , the new liner steadily maintained speed that " considerably exceeded thirty-four knots , " according to an official announcement from an executive of the United States Maritime Administration . This would be equivalent to about thirty-nine miles an hour . Just before noon , building up her power again beyond 158,000 horsepower , the contract level , the ship raced through deep water 150 miles off the Virginia Capes and attained ' an even higher speed . But it was kept a secret . However , the import @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States Lines , her owner ; the Newport ' News Shipbuilding and I ( Dry Dock Company , her builder , and Government and naval officers . Although no official claim to blue ribbon honors on the North I Atlantic can be made until the United States has repeated her perIfermance across the Atlantic after her formal entrance into the trade on July 3 , there is no doubt that the British recordholder , the Queen Mary , must look to her laurels . I Last night in the face of a stiff wind , with rain lashing the decks and sheet lightning flashing across // whitecaps , the $73,000,000 American liner drove steadily for a period of approximately eight hours . She was developing her contract power output for the first time . There was a surprising absence of vibration and when full rudder tests , crash stops and full-speed runs astern were carried through , the 1,704 persons aboard were astonished at her stability . Capt . Rex L. Hicks , construction chief of the Maritime Administration , commented : " It can be said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any merchant ship or large naval craft by a substantial margin . During the high-speed run during the night the speed of the United States considerably exceeded thirty-four knots . " Bests Queen Mary 's Average , ? ? In August , 1938 , the Queen Mary crossed the Atlantic at ? an average of 31.69 knots and for one full day steamed at 32.08 knots . After the war the aircraft carrier Lake Champlain crossed the At= lantic with troops , averaging 32.048 knots all the way . A knot is a unit of speed that represents one nautical mile ( 6.080.20 feet ) an hour . Captain Hicks , a ? retired naval ( officer , stressed that the actual speed of the new liner would not be disclosed for reasons of national security . The ship is designed for rapid conversion to a troop trans'port in the event of war . She could carry a full division of troops15,000 men  --  and their equipment . " Such information , " Captain Hicks said , " would be of inestimable value to an enemy should the United States again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enemy action . " The ship was swarming with technicians and inspectors representing , in addition to the private companies involved , various Federal agencies . They took readings as the various tests progressed during the two days . The liner had left Newport News early yesterday morning for the deep-water trials . Delivery Due This Month Last month in the first trials , most of the standard tests were successfully completed . but a full power run was postponed when two reduction gear bearings began to overheat . Adjustments corrected this minor trouble and everything worked well this time , the officials said . J. B. Woodward Jr. , president of the Newport News Yard , and William Francis Gibbs , chief designer of the ship , said that the vessel had met and even exceeded their expectations . " She is a Navy ship , but no passenger will be aware of it , " they said . The United States is ready for delivery , with the exception of a few minor finishing touches . Delivery is scheduled for June 20 , and will take place barring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Federal subsidy .
