Sir Evelyn Baring , Governor of Kenya , pulled on his medal-hung tunic with the silver &; gold epaulettes , buckled on his ivory-handled sword , and patted his plumed cocked hat into place . Then he climbed into his big black Humber and drove into Nairobi to open , in the name of the Queen , the 56-man Legislative Council ( 42 Europeans , 6 Africans , 6 Indians , 2 Arabs ) that serves as Kenya 's parliament . <P> On the front of the governor 's car waved his official flag : two crossed pangas ( broad-bladed African knives used to chop bananas ) . The pangas seemed symbolic last week , for Kenya Colony , the brightest jewel in Britain 's East African Empire , is bleeding badly in a panga war . <P> Striking from the great morose forests of the Aberdare Range , Mau Mau terrorists last week hacked an elderly Briton to pieces as he sat in his evening tub . A quick chop of the pangas and all his fingers were gone . In the port of Mombasa , supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British marine was stabbed . <P> British counteraction was swift and drastic . Thousands of Kikuyu tribesmen fled in terror to the mountains as troop carriers and armored cars rumbled through the native reserves kicking up clouds of red dust . Kenya cops tracked down " suspects " with bloodhounds , arrested thousands of Kikuyu who got in the way . The government started closing down the native schools operated by Jomo ( " Burning Spear " ) Kenyatta , the uncrowned king of the Kikuyu , whom the <P> British exiled ( TIME , Nov. 3 ) because they suspect that he is 1 ) a Communist , 2 ) the brains behind the Mau Mau . <P> Arriving in Kenya last week to make a big-game movie , U.S. Cinemactor Clark Gable boldly announced that he was n't going to worry about Mau Mau terrorism . But Kenya 's 30,000 whites , who have been around a little longer , are frankly worried . They are slowly beginning to realize that the Kenya of the movies , of pink gins and polo and unchallenged white supremacy , is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Correspondent Alexander Campbell cabled : <P> KENYA 'S white farmers , many of them impoverished aristocrats and others ex-Indian army colonels and majors , live in lonely gimcrack farmsteads dotted about the exclusive White Highlands.They drink expensive wines and dine off good china , yet few have telephones ; farmhouses are miles apart and roads are dreadful . The whites employ half a million Negroes , and could not do without them . The whites insist they do n't have a color bar , only a culture bar : a civilized man of any color is welcome . To most of Kenya 's 100,000 Indians and 5,500,000 Negroes , the effect is about the same . <P> Now , suddenly , the whites are compelled to patrol their farms by night and carry guns whenever they step outside . Fear is wearing them down . " We never get any sleep , " said a monocled German who fled to Kenya from the Nazis . " I hoped to settle here after a stormy life , but now I think the white man 's number is up . "   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
