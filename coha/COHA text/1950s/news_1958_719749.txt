txt The Delaware and Hudson Co. does not expect to earn its $2 a share annual dividend this , year ' " unless there is a substantial revival of industrial activity In the fall , " William White , - president , said at the annual meeting . " The only comfort that r can give our share owners at this moment Is that we expect to continue our dividend rate throughout this year and that our financial condition is still good , " he said . " If , however , business does not pick up by the end of this year consideration will have to be given to our dividend rate , " he added . Mr. White - said that , in view of current business conditions , the Delaware and Hudson was fortunate to earn 46 cents a share in the - first quarter of this year . " It appears unlikely that the second quarter will be as good as the first , " he said , adding that the firm may " have a small deficit in April . " Delaware and Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first half of 1957 . The company has been adversely affected by the suspension of ore shipments that began last month , Mr. White said . Republic Steel Co. has stopped ore shipments from its Adirondack mine and National Lead Ce. has suspended shipment of ilmenite ore used in making titanium , and also has reduced its shipments of iron ore , he said . The Delaware and Hudson 's total ore shipment in April was 82% less than a year ago , he added , and anthracite and bituminous coal loading " continues severely depressed . " Mr. White said the study of a possible merger of the D &; H with the Erie Railroad and the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad may not be completed for another six to eight weeks . The three railroads have requested that " a little more work " be done on the study , he said . " Things have changed rather considerably " since the three companies first decided to make the study in mid-1956 , he noted . Although none of the railroads has seen the study , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a merger would cut operating cost 's . The problem in making a decision on the study , he said , is " whether or not a ' satisfactory deal can be negotiated " that would satisfy the stockholders of all three railroads . The D &H; was disappointed because it had to finance 75% of the cost of new freight cars this year , Mr. White said . This boosted the firm 's equipment debt by $1.4 million to a total of about $15 million , he said . The company had hoped to pay cash foi ? all equipment until the equipment debt could be reduced to $10 million . " Prudence required that we preserve our cash position , " the president said .
