I Love Lucy ( Mon. 9 p.m. , CBS ) is an untrammeled TV comedy show distinguished by the high-quality slapstick of carrot-topped Comedienne Lucille Ball and her handsome Cuban-born husband , Desi Arnaz . Filmed especially for television in Hollywood , Lucy 's combination of well-written scripts and rowdy good humor proved popular enough last month to displace both Arthur Godfrey and Milton Berle , and thus became the nation 's No. i TV attraction . <P> Last week Lucy set another record : according to the American Research Bureau , the show became the first regularly scheduled TV program to be seen in 10 million U.S. homes . Estimated total audience : 30,740,000-nearly a fifth of the nation 's population .
