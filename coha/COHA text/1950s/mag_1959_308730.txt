Jimmy Hoffa and his racket-ridden International Brotherhood of Teamsters quietly set up two locals with 1,200 members . Alarmed , Smallwood last week bounced into the provincial legislature to denounce Hoffa &; Co. as " pimps , panderers , white slavers , murderers , embezzlers , extortionists and dope peddlers .
