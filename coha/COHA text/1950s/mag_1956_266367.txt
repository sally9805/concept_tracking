The Crowell-Collier magazines shook last week with the biggest convulsion since Paul C. ( for Clifford ) Smith took over the publishing company three years ago . The 80-year-old American Magazine , whose own rise paralleled the go-getting success stories it pioneered , came to an unhappy ending . Smith announced that with its August issue the magazine would fold up , leaving the company with Collier 's and Woman 's Home Companion . Into Companion went a new editorial regime to snap the magazine out of the doldrums . <P> American , which began life in the days of the second Grant Administration as Frank Leslie 's Popular Monthly , embraced the whole rise of mass magazine journalism . Changed to American in 1906 , it spent a muckraking youth publishing Lincoln Steffens , Ida Tarbell and Ray Stannard Baker , made its biggest impact under Editor John Siddall , who pushed circulation from less than 500,000 to over 2,000,000 between 1915 and 1923 with the inspirational magic of success stories . In its time , American was the first to run Kipling 's If and Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. L. Mencken to Booster Bruce Barton . When Editor Sumner Blossom took over in 1929 , he announced , " Horatio Alger does n't work here any more , " and American turned itself into a family magazine . It went on thriving for years . <P> " Transfusion . " The magazine 's failure would have mystified the business heroes it once lionized . American still has a steady circulation of 2,682,144 , just about as big as it has ever been . Yet , in the last ten years advertisers have been steadily deserting the 35 family monthly . " I do n't know exactly what the reasons are , " says Smith . " I guess they are myriad . " By cutting costs , American managed to pare its losses from $800,000 in 1953 to $150,000 in 1954 , and last year it broke even . In the first half of this year , as advertising kept thinning out , losses grew to $300,000 . Smith decided that the task of wooing advertisers back was too big and costly to tackle . <P> Instead , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit the company 's two other magazines-which are in even worse financial trouble . " The odd thing , " said Smith , " is that the least loser turned out to be the best one to pick to put out of business . " Collier 's ( circ. 3,772,079 ) lost $7.5 million in 1953 , $4.5 million in 1954 and $1.5 million last year , and Smith expects losses to be no lower in 1956 . Woman 's Home Companion ( circ. 4,117,734 ) , which was making a profit until 1953 , has lost more than $1,000,000 in advertising in the last six months . <P> Crowell-Collier plans to bolster both of the ailing magazines with a " transfusion " of circulation from American . After August , the company will send Collier 's or Companion , on an arbitrary , fifty-fifty basis , to the defunct American 's 1,875,000 subscribers . If a subscriber does not like what he gets , he may request the other magazine or-only as a last resort , the company hopes-ask for his money back . Most of American 's editorial features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longtime Editor Blossom , 64 , becomes a Crowell-Collier vice president assigned to editorial planning , and the company will try to absorb 50 of American 's 65 editorial and advertising employees .
