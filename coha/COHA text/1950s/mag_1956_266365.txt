Boston 's sickly , 125-year-old Post made news each morning last week simply by coming out . Though the Post itself printed not a line about its ordeal , no well-informed Bostonian would have been surprised to see the paper collapse or pass suddenly into new hands . The daily was in an almost comic mess-creditors swarming , funds attached , payroll delayed , newsprint delivered only for hard cash , and negotiations begun for a distress sale . <P> Eccentric , self-made Financial Juggler John Fox , 49 , snapped up the paper four years ago , when it seemed that its fortunes could go no lower . An enthusiastic cub as publisher and columnist ( " Washington Waters " ) , Fox shook up the paper into a livelier daily . But by last week . Post circulation had dropped from 306,000 to 267,000 and advertising had tumbled with it . Of the " bargain price " of a reported $3,300,000 that Fox paid for the paper , he still owes about $1,000,000 . <P> That big debt was rumored to be putting the pressure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts was making it hard for him to hold the paper long enough to sell it . Six weeks ago , the City of Boston threatened to seize the Post 's real estate if Fox did not pay up back taxes by mid-August . A fortnight ago , the U.S. Internal Revenue Service tied up the paper 's bank account with a claim for $221,116 in unpaid withholding taxes from employees . Other creditors slapped other liens on the paper and its publisher , until he had to ask employees to wait several days extra for their weekly pay . Meantime , a Boston attorney named John S. Bottomly said that he was negotiating with Fox to buy the paper , insisted that he was acting for himself . Fox announced that the paper was " not for sale . " <P> Last week , after barely meeting the extended payroll deadline with personal certified checks , Fox got a demand from the unions representing his 850 employees : either sell out and pay up the bills , or get the paper on a businesslike basis . Fox went into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union leaders all proclaimed " satisfactory . " At week 's end , Fox was still scrambling to hang on to the Post .
