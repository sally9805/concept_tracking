Like most busy men of affairs , Banker Aubrey West of London never worried much about the illegible scratches and scrawls of his careless handwriting . Then , one day in 1950 , while browsing at his club , he happened to spot a book containing examples of Renaissance calligraphy . One sample that caught his eye was that of Ludovico degli Arrighi , a 16th Century Vatican scribe who wrote thus : <P> " The sight of this handsome and practical hand , " says West , " came as a revelation . . . and I thought how wonderful it would be if people wrote like that nowadays .

Today there is a solid group of distinguished Britons who want to return to it . Under the leadership of such enthusiasts as Sir Sydney Cockerell , former director of Cambridge University 's Fitzwilliam Museum , and Lord Cholmondeley ( pronounced Chumley ) , Lord Great Chamberlain for Edward VIII , West believes that Britons may soon be writing a fine Italian hand once again . Among the modern models they could imitate : <P> Lord Cholmondeley , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calligraphic reform , writes like this : <P> or the author himself :
