It is high time , in the opinion of Greenland-born Dr. Svend Frederiksen of Washington 's Arctic Institute , that the world take account of its changing climate . For 50 years or more , says Dr. Frederiksen ( who likes to describe himself as one of the world 's two practicing Eskimologists* ) , the climate of the Arctic has been warming up , making agriculture possible where it has not been practiced in modern times . Southern Greenlanders are raising cattle and sheep as the Viking colonists did a thousand years ago-before their colony was destroyed , probably by increasing cold . Oats can be grown in Iceland and cabbages near Fort George on James Bay . The timber line is steadily creeping northward across the Canadian tundra . <P> The Arctic seas are warming , too . Eskimos of Greenland have had to abandon sealhunting ; the seals have moved farther north . Instead , the Eskimos are fishing for cod , which have moved in from the south . Even north of Siberia the water is growing warmer ; the Russians are having less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Frederiksen believes that warmth and cold in the Arctic come in cycles of about 1,800 years . Before the last peak of cold , from which the Arctic is just emerging , Greenland was really green , and the sea between Greenland and Iceland was sufficiently free of ice to permit the tiny ships of the Vikings to sail without disaster . Dr. Frederiksen predicts that this condition will return , and that great areas of Siberia , Canada and Alaska , now almost uninhabitable , will be opened to agriculture . Population will move north , and the world 's balance of power may be affected . <P> Less welcome will be another effect : as the cold recedes the southerly regions will turn increasingly warm . Dr. Frederiksen believes that the gradual shift of climate will make the southern part of the U.S. hotter and drier than it is now . Farmers will have to pump more water on their fields , and in many places water may be less plentiful . <P> The change of climate is slow and undramatic , but Dr. Frederiksen thinks that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmer future . The change will affect the economy of nations , the health of their people and the politics of the world . " Already , " he says , " we are deep in the warming-up period .
