BACK TO MANDALAY ( 320 pp. - Lowell Thomas - Greystone ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> What licked the Japs in North Burma ? The British like to think that in great part it was the jungle work of His Majesty 's guerrilla genius , Major General Orde C. Wingate , who did such a good job of mauling supply lines that the Japanese later died on the vine . In Back to Mandalay , Lowell Thomas concedes that Wingate was a genius , but he strongly implies that it was the U.S. Army Air Forces which showed Wingate how to do his job . Back to Mandalay is Thomas ' story of how a crack team of U.S. airmen , in effect , put wings on Wingate 's raiders , made his final campaign in North Burma " an air show " and stole the show from the British . <P> The U.S. air team was headed by Colonel Philip Cochran , better known as the prototype of Flip Corkin in the comic strip Terry and the Pirates. * When Cochran reached India in 1943 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport planes . Cochran calmly announced that this was no problem ; gliders would do the trick . Through and sometimes over Wingate 's persistent doubts , Cochran reconstructed the tactics of the campaign . <P> Author Thomas tells a good story , especially when he is describing with veteran skill the wild night in March 1944 when the glider-borne attackers landed behind the Jap lines . The pity is that , after giving the Americans their due , he had relatively little room left to tell the story of the British and Empire troops - whose bitter work began when the gliders rolled to a stop . <P> <P> * And who is currently busy , as a civilian , preparing training films for the Air Force .
