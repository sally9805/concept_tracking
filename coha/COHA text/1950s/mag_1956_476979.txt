DUTCHMEN do n't get excited over nothing . I was in an airliner over Holland , when the Dutch aboard started crowding each other at the windows : below us , green and shining , was a farm landscape that has only just recently come out of the sea . It is the first piece of a whole new province ( a new state , we would say ) that Holland is adding to itself : " Flevoland . " I went back later , by car , by boat , by Piper Cub , and looked into this land-making operation . It 's the pride of the Dutch . It 's what makes their eyes shine . The main method is this : you build an earthen dam from shore out into the shallow sea and back to shore , so as to fence in part at the sea . Then you pump the water out , You wait a few yearS for the rains to wash the salt out of the soil . Their you start fainting ! Such a piece of land ? saucer-shaped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a necessary word , and not translatable . Nobody has polders but the Dutch . They have been making them for five hundred years ? small ones ? and now , with big money and big machines , they make them big . I drove out on a dyke that is fencing off one future piece of Flevoland . You drive on the top of the dyke , and you do sixty . We went out of sight of land , and still the road kept going . I thought : " This is big . " You hold it against the American scale of things ? Hoover Dam , TVA , Empire State Building ? and it still is big . You hold it against the size of Holland ? six Hollands would n't fill the State of Kansas ? and it becomes colossal . It 's as if we wanted topush the Gulf of Mexico back and build a second Texas . We finally got to the capital of Flevoland , Lelystadt . Right now , it 's just a wide place in the dyke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a school . Some of the dyke-builders live there . On both sides , all the way to the horizon , there 's nothing but water . But never mind : the land is there . It merely happens to be covered with water . It will come out . I went to the part where the Iand is out , and saw the opposite sight : a real island , one that is natural and has always been there . It has a lighthouse and small harbor ? and all of it is now sitting in a sea of farmland ? all newly made . The whole thing is part of a Great Tradition . The Dutch have been pushing the sea back for a thousand years ? and the sea the Dutch . Except for dykes , much of Holland would not exist . Some of it lies below sea level , by as much as fifteen feet . This much would instantly be drowned ; some of it , at sea level , would be tidal flats . Some of it would be swamped by river floods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea tide two , three times a century . Left to nature , half of Holland would be for the fish . And this is what makes Holland Holland . Windmills , for instance : land below sea level does n't drain . You have to keep pumping the rain out . The windmills do that ? still do it , though most of the pumping now is electric , or diesel . And those wooden shoes ? ( You still see them quite a bit . ) Why ? Much of the soil is always wet , and wooden shoes arc watertight and warm . You ca n't run in them ? but then , a Dutchman is well organized ; he starts early and has no need to run . Little boys who feel like running have a special Dutch boys ' gesture : you take your shoes off and carry them both in your left hand , and run . And canals ? wherever you are in Holland , there 's always a canal in sight : down the main street of town , or along the highway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the water off the land , you need ditches criss-crossing every field , about a hundred feet apart . These ditches drain into deeper ditches ; those drain . itto canals , which run into bigger canals , and finally you come to the pumping station ? windmill , diesel , or electric : there , the water goes up into the sea . This ditdi and canal system has much to do with the looks of Holland . From the air it seems to be composed of innumerable tiny parcels ? like a brick pavement . From the ground , you do n't see all the canals , but you see one result : cows ca n't cross them , and so you see pastures full of cattle , and no fences . This leads to the tourist reaction : My , what well-behaved cows . Dutchmen are so used to having a canal around that a landscape without canals bothers them ? does n't look civilized . Wherever they have gone ? the East Indies , South America ? they have always found some excuse to build a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the " dam " in . Rotterdam , Amsterdam , and other place names : it means a dam with a sluice gate . When the tide is high , the gate is closed to keep the water from coming in . Whenthe tide is low , the gate is open , so the country can drain . This was one way the early Dutch made sea-level land habitable , even before " polders . " HAND-PICKED FARMERS F LEVOLAND , the future province , is simply the Zuider Zee dried up . It 's man 's country anyway . The North Sea broke in there over and over again . Now they are pushing it out once more . The Dutch are in no nervous hurry about it . They do the job polder by polder , each polder of about 120,000 acres , containing 2,000 farms , ten villages , a town . Note the time-scale : the Zuider Zee works were started in 1918 . The first polder came dry in 1938 . The second one ? the one we saw from the airliner ? came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third one will come dry next year . The fourth and last one is scheduled to he ready before 1980 , and even after that , there 'll be twenty years of fine-point improvement . The dyke-building outfits have jobs lined up from now to the end of the century . Behind them , the soil-conditioning crews , the road-and-bridge people , the house-and-barn contractors , all can keep moving on from job to job . The " New Country , " they call those polders . Never before in history have people had a chance to take possession of a country quite so new . The land comes out of the sea a dismal gray ? barren , flat . But it comes with the main canals already dug ; its soils already tested ; all plans made . The officials know exactly where they are going to put the town , the villages , the orchards , the woods . Woods ? Of course ; children should have woods , and the Dutch think of everything . But first the soil has to he brought to life . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to see to it that the soil can drain . This is too big a job for the individual farmer . Government contractors move in with special machines . They dig those ditches , and they bury miles and miles of drainpipe underneath the fields . And then they let the people come and take up homesteads , American style ? No . The Dutch hand-pick their settlers , farmer by farmer . The new land must go to the most competent farmers ; and they should be men who also will he useful citizens , who can run a cattle breeders ' association , get the church going , generally take hold of the new country 's civic affairs . An interviewer visits each applicant on his farm ; looks the wife over , too . Confidential informants within the farm organization report on his record , his reputation , his personality . And when the Dutch have picked their man , they plant him as carefully as they would plant a tulip bulb . They lay out the new country to look as much as possible like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see to it that the two main streets cross each other not squarely , but with a little jog . And they do n't draw the streets quite straight ; they give each a little dog-leg . This avoids that American look ? straight streets and avenues , crossing each other at right angles ? that Europeans find so soul-chilling . The countryside , too , is carefully antiqued ? a curve in the road here , a little woods used as an accent there . Having made the plans , the government builds the town ? every house in it ? the schools , the churches , the stores : the barns ( pre-fab , but old-world looking ) and the farm houses . And when the little trees are planted around the house , and the key is in the door ready to turn ? then they let the farmer come . But he ca n't buy . He only gets a twelve-year lease , renewable if he has been good . The townsman , too , is hand-picked and hand-planted . They find a good hotel man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name already written on the sign . The sociologists figure it takes one townsman for each three farmers , to teach and preach , doctor and vet , service the farm machines , nm the stores . They know just how many photographers , shoe-store owners , television service-men will be able to make a living , and just so many are planted . Nobody else can horn in because he could n't get a place to live or work . To the American , such all-powerful government control seems strange and rather horrible . It 's a long way from Oklahoma ! But then , it is now 67 years since Oklahoma had its land rush . Holland tried the American frontier style of set-dement once ? a hundred years ago . They had pumped dry a big lake ? pumping by steam had just come in and made the project possible . They turned the land over to the settlers raw ? no roads , no schools , no prepared civilization . It did not work . People lived in sod houses . There were squatters and outlaws . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All this in orderly , well-kept Holland ! " It took three generations to heal that sore . " Perhaps this is not so odd . On the American frontier , it usually took several waves of corners to change a region from outright wilderness to full civilization ; the original pioneers seldom saw the thing through ; they moved on to pioneer elsewhere . Here , in tight little Europe , there was no place for them to move to . For all the tight control , there 's something American about the " New Country " ? because it is new . It attracts the people with get-up-and-go . It gives them a thousand chances to make a new start : new school , new church , new farmers ' association , new garage , new hotel . This is.one of the ingredients of the American atmosphere , and the tourist recognizes a familiar scent . " The Old Country was more comfortable than here , " said one man wistfully . " Here , everybody is always on the go ; everybody is making money . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an official said : " Wait till these people 's children start marrying each other ! It 's going to be a high-powered new race . " COWS WITH COATS ON B U T why do all this ? " I asked . " Does it pay ? " As a straight business proposition , no . The land costs $1,500 an acre delivered raw , plus soil-conditioning , ditches , roads . If a company tried to make land and then farm it , it would go broke . " But we draw a distinction , " said a high-up Dutchman , " between private economy and public economy . " The government rents the land to the farmers at a loss . The country gains because the farmers ' money goes round and round . Each guilder 's worth of new farm production builds up , they figure , into seven guilders of new income all around the nation . And what production Dutch farmers can get off a piece of land ! They get four times the yield of wheat per acre that Americans get . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers . The Dutch go in for high-value products ? seed potatoes , breeding cattle , tulip bulbs , cut flowers , out-of-season vegetables , and of course cheese , which they eat for breakfast . They work with great care . In fall and spring , Dutch cows out on the pastures wear coats , like Park Avenue poodles . I flew over a section of Holland where the farms were glassed over . You might be stodgy and call it greenhouses , but here they were so big . so many of them so close together that , from the air , seeing things as they really are , you have to call it a glassed-over countryside . So , you take a newly-made acre , multiply it by four for big production , and then by seven for the round-and-round effect , and land-making does pay . But quite apart from all money angles , the Dutch want to keep the country part of their national life big and healthy . To many Europeans country life is something special , almost fir fisrek . VIA .4 ! t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on farms ; farm boys make the best soldiers . The country is morally good , the city dubious at best . The city is where a nation dies out ; the country , where it is reborn . And so on . True or not , these ideas are strong , especially where German thought is influential . Germany has for a hundred years protected her farm life against the competition of American wheat and Argentine beef for just those reasons . Great Britain now sometimes wishes she had done the same . There 's also the idea that a nation should be able to eat off its own land , come war , depression , trade restrictions , or what-not . Holland decided on the Zuider Zee works in 1918 ? after four years of watching Germany and Great Britain trying to starve each other by submarine and blockade . That is the background . Against this , the Dutch see cities , highways , industries , gobble up land . Also , many Dutch farms have been subdivided too many times among too many sons , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking for land and ca n't find it . Holland has been subsidizing the emigration of its own people ? to any country where they can get in . That 's a sad thing for a country to have to do . The farmer , the Dutch think , ought to have a chance in his own country , just as the engineer or the businessman has . Hence land-making . SLEEPERS AND DREAMERS B U T the Dutch people need no such argu- ments . To them , land-making is just simply Good Works . For the glory of God , for the dignity of Man , for the future of your children ? if you are Dutch , you build dykes . And dykes are sacred . In the old days , if a man harmed a dyke , they buried him right in the dyke ? and did n't wait to kill him first . Today , there are no keep-off signs on the dykes , no guards : they are not needed . When a new dyke is built , further toward the sea , nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , active dyke is called the " watchman " ; the next one in , the " sleeper " ; the oldest one , farthest from the sea , the " dreamer . " Sleepers and dreamers still are important . They put a limit to the worst that can happen . They divide the country up into many small polders , so that Holland is like a ship with watertight compartments . The water has to fill one basin before it can attack the next dyke . This takes time ; and the very high floods do n't last so long . The thought of flood is always there . Almost anywhere in Holland , if you look around for a few minutes , you find some marks drawn on a house somewhere : this is how high the water came in such and such a year . The marks are always over your head : if it happened again right now , you would be swimming . Floods come to Holland more from wind-push than from the tide . A northwest wind drives water into the North Sea through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get out except through the English channel ? very narrow . There is no mom for a deep-down undertow by which the water could return northward : the North Sea is too shallow . So the water piles up against the Dutch coast ? sometimes fifteen feet above normal . Then comes the tide . And if the wind-shifts happen to hit the timing just right and the two water mountains , the wind-driven one and tidal one , really get moving ? look out . When a dyke goes , it . does n't simply break ; nor is it simply overtopped . The spray from the waves blows over the top ; water runs down the landward slope and makes gullies ; slowly , from the landward side , they eat into the dyke . Once a low place is made and solid water begins to pour , there is no stopping it : it comes as a gigantic rapids , and that particular polder will now fill up . The water 's rush slows down as it spreads , away from the break . To those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great flood of February 1 , 1953 , came quietly . A child woke up and said : " Mammy , there is water in the kitchen . " By that time , it was too late to flee to the dykes . For them the only high place was the roof . Then the roofs floated off with people on them . One family , that February night , floated across miles of open water . When their roof fetched up against an island , the wife and children were dead from exposure . An hour later , their dog landed , in a wooden box , blown by the same wind to the same spot . Now the man and the dog are back on the farm . Eighteen hundred people were drowned that night . And the land , which Dutchmen love more than they love themselves , was terribly damaged . The salt got in the soil and killed everything , including trees that had been growing for a hundred years . The sections that were hit are now absolute prairie . The salt got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks have soaked up salt water , they will be clammy ever after : you might as well tear the house down . The sea scoured up masses of sand and buried the soil under it . Rut you know the Dutch : stubborn . I saw them work with power shovels and drag lines . They dig around in the sand until they find the soil . Then they pick the soil up and spread it on top of the sand . Square yard by square yard , acre by acre , farm by farm . The government does it ? and recovers part of the cost by a thirty-year special assessment against the farm ? a sort of mortgage . " These farms are going to be better than they were . " Bad as it was , Holland has seen worse . In one night in November 1421 , about 31/2 per cent of Holland 's whole population was drowned . It was then that the Dutch really declared war on the sea . Since then , they have become virtuosos at working with water and mud and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barge that capsizes itself and dumps its load of clay , then rights itself ? same idea as a dump truck . A " mattress " woven of willow branches : it 's the world 's biggest piece of basketry , being about half an acre . You float it to the job as a raft . Then you sink it , by weighing it down with rocks . It protects the bottom against the scouring action of tide currents . The suction dredge is a ship that sends a sort of elephant 's trunk down to the sea bottom , and sniffles up sand , mixed with water ? same idea as a vacuum cleaner . Then , through a long pipe , it dumps this sandy water in some selected place . The water runs off , but the sand remains : this is how they now build their giant dykes in the Zuider Zee : they pour them . It looks wonderfully effortless : just a few ships on the vast water surface , and of course no dust ? everything floats and flows , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dyke is sand ? or any other earth-fill that is handy . The sides are of a fancy watertight clay , which you find here and there on the sea bottom -- if you know your way around . The sides of a dyke are also armored with those willow mattresses . A layer of straw is often sandwiched in . Then . the seaward side is paved with stories ! Down the canal that 's always there in Holland , there always comes a barge loaded with stones for some dyke , somewhere . Holland has no stones ; they have to be imported , and a Dutchman can tell : this load came from Germany , this one from Norway , this one is Swiss . In dyke-building or repairing , the great moment comes when it 's all completed but for a small gap . Through this gap the tides flow in and out as raging currents , sweeping away any earth-fill you might shovel there or pour there . But four times a day , for a few minutes each time the water levels on both sides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that moment , they bring up a barge , loaded with rocks ; they tow it into the gap and sink it : job completed . THE MONSTER F 0 R Holland the Sea is a double-headed monster . It comes as flood , and it also comes as salt . " The devil , arid the poison , " say the Dutch . Salt in the soil kills plants two ways : directly , and by making the soil pasty and airtight , instead of nice and crumbly . And salt keeps getting into Holland 's soil . It comes up the rivers ? much farther inland than people used to know . Salt water is heavier than fresh . It pushes inland as an undertow , underneath fresh water that is flowing into the sea . Then a ship comes and mixes the two . The poisoned water then sneaks into the canals , into the fields . Locks do n't keep it out . The world 's biggest locks lead from the sea into the canal to Amsterdam harbor . Every time a steamship passes through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreads through Holland 's inland waters . So the whole country 's canal system must he continuously sweetened up with fresh water from the Rhine . And now even the Rhine is getting slightly salty . It 's not enough to taste , but enough to worry the Dutch . Reason ? deep coal mines in Germany strike salt water . They have to pump it out ; it finds its way into the Rhine ? " Europe 's big sewer , " as a Dutchman bitterly describes it . The Dutch are now getting ready to do a big persuasion job on Germany . It 's quite a brainteaser , though . Just exactly how do you get rid of floods of salt water that spring up in the middle of a country ? But for Holland the biggest salt invasion is by seepage through the soil . It stands to reason : you 've got land below sea level ; the sea water will flow in if it can . Sometimes it seeps inland through layers deep underground , and from there upward into the soil . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a century basis , the polder idea turns out to be not so good . ( We in the United States are inviting the same trouble on both coasts , where we pump up ground water for irrigation , and thus cause sea water to flow inland underground . But we still have time . ) The Dutch have done much thinking about this . And they have come up with a typical Dutch answer : they need a canal ! Here is the reasoning : you have to see to it that the water outside the polder , the water that 's pressing to get in , is fresh and not salt . This means each polder ought to be surrounded by a fresh-water canal , in which the water level is kept high . This is the main new trick ? apart from sheer size of their operations ? that the Dutch have added to their art in this century . And the Zuider Zee works are a gigantic example of it . The first step of that project was a super-dyke that seals off the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one off in 1933 . Thenthey waited five years , letting water flow out through the sluice-gates , but never in . Slowly the Zuider Zee , fed by the River Issel , a branch of the Rhine , turned into a fresh-water lake . As it changed its water , it changed its name . Today , Dutchmen appreciate it if you call it the Issel Lake . I T ' S out of this fresh-water lake that they 're now building their polders and getting their new land . When all the polders are in , the fresh-water lake will still survive as a system of broad waterways between the polders . And now they have their eye on two more spots where they think the saute trick system will work ? build a dam , develop a fresh-water lake , and then build polders into it . They think they can pump themselves up a couple of very nice little provinces . The first spot is the delta of ? the Rhine ? the island country that was so hard hit in ' 53 . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These projects take us well past the middle of the twenty-first century . You see again how big the time-scale is on which the Dutch do their geographical engineering . This may he why the whole thing has got so little attention . Everybody knows something of the sort is going on ; but at any one time , everything you see looks like old news , slightly stale : " Why , " says the tourist , " I heard about all this when I was a child . " Yet the thing as a whole is terrific news , century-wise . It proves once more what may be the biggest new thing Man has learned in this century : There 's always more of everything ! We do n't need new continents to take over : there 's more of everything right where we are : more food , more oil , more wood , more water , more jobs .... Each time it seems incredible , but each time somebody comes and proves it 's true . And now the Dutch come , right in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true even of land ! And do n't think the Dutch have it easy , and that their country sort of invites land-making .... Not so . All this time , Holland is sinking ! The geologic evidence is conclusive : Holland is sinking under the sea at the rate of six inches per century . This does not discourage the Dutch .
