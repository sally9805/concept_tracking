To the San Bernardino ( Calif . ) County Hospital early this year came a 14-year-old girl with a deep , body-shaking cough that had lasted continuously for 72 hours . The diagnosis : cough due to pressure on the laryngeal nerve . <P> The standard cough suppressants-syrup , steam inhalations , potassium iodide , codeine and various barbiturates-had no effect . After eight days of steady coughing at 15-to-30-second intervals , the girl was close to death from exhaustion . As a last resort , Dr. Richard Gwartney , a specialist in psychosomatic medicine , attempted a much-debated remedy : medical hypnosis . With several attendant physicians , Gwartney sat by the girl 's bed and explained what he intended to do , without mentioning the term hypnotism . Said he , in a report on the case last week : " It was all verbal suggestion . I told her she wanted to get over her cough , and that if she cooperated we could help her . " Finally , he told the girl that by the time he had counted ten , her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes but remained conscious . <P> Gwartney then went on planting his suggestions : that the urge to cough could be resisted , that she would feel much better if it was . In the course of three hypnotic treatments , he suggested that she could suppress the cough for longer and longer intervals , starting with one minute and building up to a full hour . On the second day , the girl was instructed to cough only when absolutely necessary ; on the third day she was discharged . <P> Dr. Gwartney is quick to point out that hypnotic treatment did not " cure " the cough , but merely planted in the patient 's mind the idea that she could suppress it herself . The girl still coughs occasionally , since there is a physical cause for the symptom , but her own knowledge that she can stop if she wishes has prevented long paroxysms.
