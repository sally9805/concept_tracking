Sweeping through a subarctic fog one morning last week , the Icelandic patrol boats Maria Julia and Thor bore down on a pair of British trawlers that had dropped their nets within seven miles of Iceland 's coast . The Icelanders had succeeded in getting nine men aboard the trawler Northern Foam when the British frigate Eastbourne charged at flank speed onto the scene . The nine boarders were quickly subdued , bundled into a motor launch and ferried back to Thor . But Thor 's skipper refused to accept them , on grounds that the British had used coercion in removing them from the trawler . Reluctantly , the skipper of the Eastbourne took the Icelanders aboard his own ship-not as prisoners , but as " guests " of the British Admiralty . <P> Meanwhile , the Maria Julia pulled alongside the trawler Lifeguard with another boarding party ready to leap . But as the two ships tossed and rolled , the Icelandic boat was holed above the waterline by the Lifeguard 's hull , and her boarders beaten back by a flourish of British boathooks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with steaming water from the Lifeguard 's boilers . <P> When news of this bloodless defeat reached Iceland 's capital of Reykjavik , outraged citizens massed before the residence of Britain 's Ambassador Andrew G. Gilchrist , began pitching stones and bricks . Inside , Ambassador Gilchrist , a 48-year-old Scot with a Vandyke beard , reacted in the approved pukka sahib tradition . He put on a bagpipe recording to drown out the shouts from the street , and remarked of the mob 's marksmanship that " if they were cricket players , they would be better shots . " He further daunted the unruly natives by walking his dog at the height of the uproar and coolly staring down the nearest mobsters . " Nothing to it , " he remarked casually , returning to his window-shattered residence . <P> Quarrel with Overtones . These odd encounters were the opening skirmishes in a conflict with deadly serious overtones . Iceland is a NATO member , and the U.S. airbase at Keflavik is a keystone in NATO defense . Yet in their anger at Britain , Icelanders , spurred on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were muttering about withdrawing from NATO and closing down the U.S. airfield . <P> The quarrel grew from Iceland 's unilateral decision to extend its territorial waters to a twelve-mile limit and to ban fishing by foreigners within that area ( TIME , June 16 ) . Britain 's answer was to escort its trawler fleet with frigates of the Royal Navy , far more powerful than the one-gun patrol boats of the Icelandic coast guard . The British point : if Iceland gets away with a twelve-mile limit , other nations with valuable fishing grounds-Norway , Denmark , Canada-might follow suit .
