 | You Can Afford to Send Your Child to Collage I HAVE visited 17 college campuses and talked with leading authorities on financing a college education . I came back with exciting news for the average . American family , people whose incomes run from $4,000 to $7,000 a year . I found that a college education for their children is within reach ? if they take advantage of all the possibilities . . And they can do it without undue strain . I learned that a fifth of all college students today come from families with incomes of less than $3,000 . Today every college has officials ready to sit down with you and map out a pro , ram for financing your child 's education . They talk of installment payments , learn-while-you-work plans , loans , scholarships . The outright dollar assistance they can offer worthy students has doubled in the past few years . How much will you need ? The typical range is from about $1,250 per year for a state university to about $2,375 for a private women 's college . Costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest , the West and finally the South . The overall national average is $1,600 per year . If you gasp at these figures , remember this : Living costs , not educational costs , account for at least $800 of the total . It is expensive to feed , house , clothe and amuse a young man or woman today . Your youngster is going to eat up $400 in food during a nine-month period , at home or at school . ( It may be cheaper to feed him , mess-hall style , in school . ) Where will all that money come from ? It 's easier than you may think . Ideally , you should start your planning ? and saving ? several years before college . But few people do . And some-students manage at expensive schools such as Amherst and Princeton without a penny from their parents . It 's rugged , but can be done . Let 's assume the worst . You have no savings whatever . Your income is $5.000 a year . Where will your youngster get the money for college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Part-time work during the school year ? Summer jobs ? Scholarships ? Loans A job at college ? Nearly two-thirds of all college men work part time during the school year . At the University of California in Los Angeles more than 80 percent work . Even at so-called rich boys ' schools such as Yale and Harvard , nearly half do . The colleges search out good jobs . The University of Chicago , for example , flatly guarantees all the part-time work a boy wants . Most schools like male students to work ? it 's educational . Many colleges , such as Ohio State University and the University of California at Santa Barbara , will even arrange class schedules to fit work hours . What kinds of jobs ? They range from taxi driving , waiting on table , servicing cars , and house painting to taking care of lawns , washing windows , selling books ,  | working as a plant guard . At Stanford University , more than a dozen students are firemen , earning free board , room and laundry , plus $20 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that job opportunities at a college in a small , isolated town are fewer than at a big-city school . Special skills . Some marketable skill that your youngster can take to school helps out ? can he type , repair auto engines or play in a dance band ? He will command more money and be in greater demand . In California a young married man with three children decided ? even though he had no financial backlog ? to try to become a doctor . He managed it by , of all things , spending a few months learning carpentry . He became good enough to be accepted by the union and earned ? while in medical school ? $2.50 an hour ( most collegians earn less ? $1 to $1.75 an hour ) . This man worked 25 or more hours a week and still managed to be an honor student . Fifteen hours is a better work goal , however , permitting more time for studies and campus activities . Such a schedule , even at $1 an hour , would yield nearly $550 each school year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to look into schools with full-fledged work-while-you-learn programs , which pay almost all expenses Antioch College in Yellow Springs . Ohio , pioneered this idea with its fiveyear program . Students study on campus half the time and work in all corners of the globe the other half . Two students share one full-time job so that it is always filled , and they are paid more than $50 a week while they work . Today 43 different schools , including many of America 's leading technological institutes , have these " co-op " programs . They include the University of California . University of Georgia , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Northwestern . Purdue , Cornell , Rensselaer and Drexel . Here 's how one man took advantage of the co-op program . Husky Richard Knapp , like his father , was a foundry worker near Chicago . He felt he was " stuck in the foundry " and says , " I had assumed I could n't afford to go to college . " Then he heard that his company was sending two men to Illinois Tech under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During his college years the company paid $3,000 in tuition for him , and gave him $ ' 7,000 in paychecks . When he started , college he was making $50 a week . By graduation he was making $80 and became a production engineer . If you would like detailed information Find out about scholarships ? there are more than you 'd think DO N'T overlook any chance to help your youngster get a scholarship . So many are offered that no one person knows about them all . Here are eight sources of information that you should check : 1 The high-school guidance counselor will have leads on scholarships that are available locally . 2 Write to the admissions officers of the colleges your youngster is considering and ask for their printed material on scholarships . ( These also usually contain information on loan funds. ) 3 If you work for a large company ask the personnel director if the company has any scholarships , tuition-refund plans or loans for college students . It probably will have . The book You Can . Win a Scholarship ( $2.98 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road , Great Neck , N.Y. ) lists 51 firms that have scholarship programs . 4 If a member of your family belongs to a union , check the local about scholarship possibilities , or write to the AFL-CIO De96 POPULAR SCIENCE partment of Education , 1625 I Street , Washington 6 , D. C. , for its list of scholarships . 5 Ask your minister what scholarships may be available to schools affiliated with your church . The Methodist Church , for example . publishes a list of its scholarships . 6 Write the Department of Education of your state for information about scholarships offered by the state government . 7 For information about the hundreds of federal scholarships available , see the Barron 's book named above or check Federal Aid to Students for Higher Education , put out by the Congressional Legislative Reference Service . 8 If you belong to an organization such as the Kiwanis , Eiks or Rotary , ask a local official about scholarship funds or special loan funds that may be available to your son . If you belong to the American Legion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Need a Lift ? " published by the Scholarship Information Service of the American Legion , Indianapolis 6 , Ind .  | on schools with co-op programs , write for Circular No. 463 of the U. S. Office of Education , U. S. Dept. of Health , Education and Welfare , Washington 25 , D. C. Vacation jobs . Most colleges expect students to earn some of their college expenses during the three-month summer shutdown . By springtime the colleges have long lists of openings : from summer resorts , camps , companies . Industries short on technical personnel seek students for summer work not only because the help is needed , but also because they want to get talented young people oriented with them for possible full-time employment after graduation . How much can your youngster earn during a summer ? A fair guess is $400 . But several Amherst students made $2,000 each by sealing in Alaska or taking double jobs at home . One lad drove a milk truck mornings , did construction work later . Scholarships . The money given to worthy students has more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has some scholarship help . At well-endowed private schools like the University of Chicago one student in every three has a scholarship . At state universities the ratio drops to one student in 10 . The average scholarship provides $250 to $500 a year , but some exceed $2,000 . At least 20,000 scholarships go begging each year because students , and their parents , do n't know about them or do n't qualify . The main sources of scholarship money are wealthy well-wishers , corporations , churches , benevolent organizations , unions , state and federal governments . General Motors offers several hundred scholarships a year . New York State offers 4,438 . How can you tell if your youngster could get a scholarship ? In general he should meet three requirements . He should be bright , preferably in the top quarter of his high-school class . The National Merit Scholarships ( which practically put a boy or girl through college ) are limited to students in the top five percent of their classes . ? He should have a good record of highschool activities . MIT rejects the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow humans . Continued on page 206  | He should need the money . Many schools wo n't consider a youngster for a scholarship , no matter how brilliant he is. if his father makes more than $8,501 When your child applies for a scholarship . you 'll probably get a long form asking about your income , assets , dependents and so on . It will come from the College Scholarship Service , which helps the colleges appraise the " need " of applicants . But many scholarships require out-ofthe-ordinary qualifications . If your child happens to fill them , he may get the money even though his grades are not tops or his need is not acute . Wealthy people often endow scholarships , specifying that the winner must be from the donor 's home town ( say Bucyrus , Ohio ) : must have the same last name ( at Amherst the lucky names are Anderson . Clapp , Rowland and Borden ) ; or must have a parent who is a teacher , minister . widow , and so on . Children of GIs who died from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college from the Federal Government . Loans . This source of money is the one most people overlook . The average college has at least twice as much money to lend out as is applied for ; some schools have eight times as much . The schools prefer to lend money to upperclassmen ( because a great many freshmen drop out ) but others make loans to freshmen . More and more , you 'll find colleges eager to interest you in a loan . As an official at Yale says : " Everyone else in America is selling on credit ! " Lending spreads the available money further than outright gifts . How much will the colleges lend ? Often , the entire tuition . At Massachusetts Institute of Technology almost any student in good standing can borrow more than $1,000 a year during his last three years . And the terms are amazingly inviting . There is no interest to pay until after graduation . Then the interest becomes one percent and the debt can be paid off as leisurely as you choose , as long as the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge two percent interest during college years , four percent after graduation . You can also get , at hundreds of col- leges , short-term easy-payment plans for spreading the big tuition charge over the year . At Washington University in St. Louis , for example , it 's six payments . Another system is The Tuition Plan , Inc. ( 347 Fifth Ave. , New York City ) , which will take over paying school costs and bill you each month . You pay the Plan . It charges four percent for the service . Your money . Dad is still the mainstay when it comes to financing college . On the average , he supplies $640 a year . That means about $12 a week . Colleges are pretty expert at estimating how much a student can expect from home . Harvard , for example , assumes you should " maintain " your youngster ( food , clothing , shelter , health ) , whether he is at college or not . How much does that come to ? Harvard figures it depends on how much you earn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a table . If you make $5,000 a year and have two children , this table says you ought to kick in $550 a year toward college . If you have a few years before college , make sure you 'll have the cash when the time arrives by starting a " college fund . " Buy U. S. bonds , put money in a savings bank , or invest in conservative stocks . If your child is very young , consider an endowment policy on yourself or him . Some insurance companies have policies to pay for college . How it adds up . Now let 's see where we stand in raising the $1,600 that the average collegian needs . We 'll assume no scholarship  | separate years . College is still a possibility if you know how to cut corners . He are five tips : 1 . Choose a low-cost college . At some schools the total cost is half the $1.600 average . Check on state universities in your own state ( outside your state , you may be socked for extra assessments There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and only modest fees ) . Among them : Alabama Polytechnic Institute , University of Arizona , University of Alabama , Berea College , City College of New York , Florida State University , University of Idaho , Louisiana State University . University of Missouri . 2 . Let the Army , Navy or Air Force send your son to college . At the service academies ( West Point , Annapolis and Colorado Springs ) the Federal Government picks up the whole tab and even tosses in spending money ( $111.15 a month at West Point ) . To qualify for entrance examinations . your son has to be nominated . Contact your U. S. Representative or Senator , or write to the chief of personnel for the department ( Army , Navy or Air Force ) that most interests your son . The address is The Pentagon , Washington 25 , D. C. 3 . Pick a nearby college so your youngster can commute from home . On paper , at least , that saves up to $700 . Nearly all cities have either a large college or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child can go the first two years , then transfer to the main campus . Pennsylvania State University , the University of California and the University of Michigan , to mention just three , have networks of branch campuses in their states . 4 . Night school . College at night , work in the day is a fast-growing trend . More than 100 colleges now have full-scale programs . Half the students are seeking degrees , although this usually takes eight years . Your high school 's guidance counselor can tell you about local possibilities . 5 . Two-year college . Many youngsters and perhaps yours is one ? could profit from advanced training beyond high school but do n't really need a full fouryear course . These two-year schools are known also as community colleges , junior colleges or branch " centers. "
