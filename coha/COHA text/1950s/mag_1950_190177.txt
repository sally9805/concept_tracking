Said he : " It is a wonder that we sit here in our new House of Europe , calmly discussing our plans for the future happiness and concord of our peoples and their moral and cultural ideals . It is a wonder , but at least it is better than getting into a panic . " <P> Explained Churchill : " The Soviet forces . . . outnumber the forces of the Western Union by at least six or seven to one . . . Apart from the establishment of the American bomber base in England , nothing has been done to give any effective protection to our peoples from being subjugated or destroyed by the Russian Communist armies . . . The question which challenges us is : Shall we have the time to prepare our defenses ? No one can answer that question for certain . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madness of despair ...

If , while that superiority lasts , " we can create a trustworthy system of defense ... we shall at least have removed the most obvious temptation to those who seek to impose their will by force upon the free democracies .

" His motion was carried by 89 votes to 5 , with 27 delegates abstaining . ( Of the five nay votes , one was cast by a British socialist and four by Irish members , who attacked Mr. Churchill for British " aggression " in Ireland . ) <P> No resolution passed at Strasbourg could bind any national government , but Churchill promised that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other delegates said they would do the same in their own countries .
