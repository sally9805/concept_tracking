Reason : movies portray old age as " a trap , a pit , a hopeless end , ' ' and glorify " teenage super-beauties as the American ideal . " Objectionable oldster types , according to State Senator Thomas C. Desmond , 63 : Lionel Barrymore ( as a cantankerous oldster ) , Billy Burke ( as a rattlebrain ) . Objectionable youngster types , " the type of youth glorification that makes it difficult for older women to find a useful , happy place in modern life " : Lana Turner , Marilyn Monroe , Betty Grable . Retorted the Motion Picture Association of America : Senator Desmond is making " a desperate play for publicity . . . and failed to check the long and respected list of Hollywood 's own senior citizens , still going strong after many years of entertaining millions of people .
