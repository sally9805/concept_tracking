Few bookies have ever had a better cover for their activities than Martin Wanzig , 42 , of Chicago . Judged by the standards of his high-paying profession , his average under-the-counter traffic was modest : seldom over $35 a day . But his clientele was loyal and steady . As a patient-orderly at Chicago State Hospital , a 385-acre mental institution , Wanzig enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the betting of 5,000-odd potential horse players . <P> Patient Wanzig ( diagnosis : schizophrenic with suicidal tendencies ) operated with remarkable freedom until last month , when police discovered that a nurse at Chicago State had killed herself because she was despondent over her betting losses . The trail led inexorably toward the asylum bookie , who had salted away some $2,000 in the last year by placing $2 to $10 bets for hospital employees and bets of as little as 25 for hard-pressed patients . His outside contact was his girl friend , Dorothy Hughes , 31 , who visited him daily at the hospital . Dorothy would phone in Wanzig 's bets to a bookie with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week investigators moved in on Wanzig , and got four hospital employees fired as accomplices . ( Said a Chicago cop : " This confirms my thought that confirmed horse players can find a home anywhere . " ) But right there the law ran into a dead end . Wanzig 's defense against prosecution is airtight : he can plead not guilty by reason of insanity .
