Deep in his heart , every art collector yearns to pick up a painting for a few dollars , dust it off and discover it is really a long-lost old master . For one collector , the wish has come true . In Johannesburg , Businessman ( tire-recapping ) Maurice Hirsch poked around at a local auction sale and bought for $375 a painting he thought " looked good . " Local collectors were doubtful , but Hirsch sent detail photographs of the painting to Belgian Historian Leo van Puyvelde . The verdict : Van Puyvelde had examined that very painting before in 1937 . It is , he wrote , L'Erection de la Croix , a " genuine work by Anthony Van Dyck , where the creative power of the painter expresses itself masterfully . " Estimated value : $30,000.
