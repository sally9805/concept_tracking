" Here ? " said Aunt Fanny blankly . " Where else ? " said Mrs. Halloran . " This is still a house of mourning , Orianna . Had you for-gotten ? " " You never remember Lionel , Fanny , except when he might be an inconvenience to me . I am expecting guests . A Mrs. Willowand her two daughters . Very old friends of mine . " " From another walk of life , I suppose , " Aunt Fanny said with a little smile . " If they are such very old friends of yours . " " No , Aunt Fanny , they will not please you . How delightful that I should be in a position to entertain them even if they do not please Aunt Fanny . " " Two daughters ? " said Miss Ogilvie . " Will they attend my little school for Fancy ? " " I hardly think so . The older of them must be nearly thirty , and I expect there is very little she can learn from you now , Miss Ogilvie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the same little smile , " we need not expect them to stay for long . " " I have not seen Augusta Willow for nearly fifteen years , " Mrs. Halloran said with seeming irrelevancy , " but I can not believe that she has changed that much . " " When are they coming ? " Miss Ogilvie asked . " The sixteenth . That would be Friday , Essex , would it not ? " A car was sent late Friday afternoon to meet Mrs. Willow and her daughters , and Maryjane finding herself unequal to meetingcompany so late in the day , Mrs. Halloran waited in the drawing room with Mr. Halloran by the fire , and Essex and Miss Ogilvie and Aunt Fanny to receive her very old friend , whose voice was heard from the driveway as she got out of the car , directing the disposition of numerous pieces of luggage . Mrs. Halloran smiled at Aunt Fanny , who seemed to be count/ing under her breath the severally designated little blue bags and large tan dress cases and hatboxes and jewelcases and overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Aunt Fanny , how lucky that your father has set an arbitrary end to this visit , " and then , still smiling , rose to greet her friend . Mrs. Willow was a large and overwhelmingly vocal woman , with a great bosom and an indefinable air of having lost some vital possession down the front of it , for she shook and trembledand regarded herself with such enthusiasm that it was all the casual observer could do at first to keep from offering to help . Whatever she had lost and was hoping to recover , it was not her good humor , for that was unlosable , and seemed , in fact , as much a matter of complete insensitivity as of good spirits ; Mrs. Willow was absolutely determined to be affable , and would not be denied . " And you have gotten older , Orianna , " she said , entering , " how glad I am ! The older we get ourselves the more we like to see it in our friends , " and she smiled amply around the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them all to her bosom , that repository of lost treasures , and cherish them for having grown older every minute since they were born , " and I ca n't say , " she continued happily , " that you 've done anything to improve the looks of this old place . And I wo n't say , " she went on , " that Richard Halloran looks well . " She nodded toward Mr. Halloran , in his wheel chair by the fire . " This is a house of mourning , ma'am , " Aunt Fanny said . " And this is Aunt Fanny . My sister-in-law , " Mrs. Halloran said . " I had forgotten what a disturbance you make , Augusta . " " Do n't I ? " said Mrs. Willow . She turned slowly , to regard with individual speculation each person in the room . " Who 's that young man ? " she asked , as one going directly to the heart of a problem.  | " Essex , " Mrs. Halloran said , and Essex bowed , speechless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttered , looked for help to Richard Halloran , and made a weak smile . " You remember my gels ? " Mrs. Willow asked , gesturing . " That one 's Arabella , the pretty one , and the dark one 's Julia . Curtsey to your Aunt Orianna , pets . " " Do try to call me Mrs. Halloran , " Mrs. Halloran said to the two girls . These , accustomed to the manners of their mother , tended clearly to underestimate the rest of the world ; the dark one , who was Julia , nodded gracelessly , said , " Hello , " and turned away . Arabella , who was the pretty one , smiled prettily , her eye falling  --  as perhaps it had not before  --  upon Essex , behind Mrs. Halloran 's chair . " How do you do ? " she said . " Well . " Mrs. Willow , having surveyed the room and the people in it , turned back to Mrs. Halloran . " Pretty dull here , are you ? You like my gels , Orianna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Halloran . " Of course , it is not impossiblethat they may improve upon further acquaintance . " " Richard , " said Mrs. Willow , going to him by the fire , " you remember me ? Do you keep well ? I ca n't say you look fit . " " My brother is grieving , ma'am , " said Aunt Fanny . " It 's Augusta , is it not ? " Richard Halloran said , looking up . " They think I am unable to remember , Augusta , but I remember you clearly ; you wore a red dress and the sun was shining . " Mrs. Willow laughed hugely . " I 've come back to cheer you a little , Richard . " " Do you remember , " Richard Halloran asked , raising his eyes to Mrs. Willow , " when we rang the bells over the carriage house ? " " Do I not , " said Mrs. Willow comfortably . " Ah , you used to be a gay one , Richard . Plenty of pranks in your time , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire ; you , " she gestured to Essex , " come and help me move his chair . "  | " If you please , " Aunt Fanny said , coming forward with dignity , " my brother is perfectly comfortable here . This is my father 's house , ma'am , and my brother may sit where he pleases within it . " " Of course he may , dear , " Mrs. Willow patted Aunt Fanny on the shoulder . " Just as soon as I have him a little bit away from the fire . " This is what you bring into a house of mourning , " Aunt Fanny said bitterly to Mrs. Halloran . Mrs. Willow was not listening ; she had moved Richard 's chair enough away from the fire to allow her to stand wholly in front of the fireplace , and she lifted her skirt in back to warm her legs . " I shall expect you to keep away from the servants , Augusta , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Well , now , " and Mrs. Willow laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time I could tell you about , " and she turned to include the room in her confidential smile . " Imagineold Orianna remembering  --  I 'll tell you , " she added pointedlyto Essex , " when my gels are n't around . Now , " she said , " why do n't we get caught up on old times ? Orianna , tell me everything that 's happened since I saw you last . " Arabella , who was the pretty one , was already whispering confidentially into the ear of Essex , and Julia , who was the clever one , was listening to Miss Ogilvie 's whisper ; " Someone to talk to around here , " Arabella was saying , and " Snake behind the bookcase , " Julia was hearing . " I think you have quite enough company without me , " Aunt Fanny said to Mrs. Halloran . " Perhaps I might be permitted to spend the evening privately with my brother ? " " Splendid , " Mrs. Willow said heartily . " Poor Richard badly wants cheering . You give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll perk up a wonder . "  | " Orianna ? " said Aunt Fanny remotely . " Of course , Aunt Fanny . " Mrs. Halloran looked without fondness upon Arabella . " Richard , " she asked , " shall we take you back to your room now ? " " I will not have eggs again , " Richard Halloran said . " Orianna , tell them in the kitchen that I will not have eggs again . " " Certainly you will not . And Aunt Fanny will be with you ; I believe that they have made you a chocolate pudding . " " Orianna , " said Aunt Fanny in sudden apprehension , " where are you putting Mrs. Willow and her daughters ? Naturally , in the left wing with Maryjane ? " " We must not intrude upon Maryjane 's grief , Aunt Fanny . They will be at the end of the long hall near the stairway , and on the floor above you . You can not possibly hear them . " " I will hear them , Orianna , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will hear them ; my rest will be constantlydisturbed . " " Then do n't tell anyone what goes on . " Mrs. Willow gave a huge wink and Aunt Fanny put her hand to her throat , and closed her eyes . " Will you say goodnight , Richard ? " Mrs. Halloran asked , turning the wheel chair , and Mr. Halloran bowed his head graciously and said , " Goodnight to all of you . " " Sweet dreams to you , " Mrs. Willow said , and Miss Ogilvie said , " Goodnight , Mr. Halloran , " and Julia and Arabella glanced up , and down again . Mrs. Halloran took the wheel chair slowly out of the room and across the hall and Aunt Fanny gave one last malevolent glance at Mrs. Willow and followed her . " That was sweet of you , " Julia said spitefully to her sister , " hanging around and whispering around her , and that big innocent stare . "  | " We 're supposed to get along , " Arabella said , touching her blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the first five minutes we 're here . " " We could see how she fell in love with you . " " Shut up , both of you , " Mrs. Willow said . " You 're not here to squabble , my pretties .

Admire the gardens , and get her to show them to you , and you can put in some good work there  --  you know , flatter her a little ; we all like that . Julia , you 've got more patience  --  youtake up with  --  what 's the little one 's name ? " she asked Essex . " Fancy , " said Essex , enchanted . " Fancy . Julia , you get after the little girl .

" " She will ? " Mrs. Willow looked at Miss Ogilvie . " No one 's going to cut you out , " she said at last . " There 's plenty for all of us , honey . " Miss Ogilvie laughed shortly . " Aunt Fanny 's father might not think so . " Mrs. Willow frowned . " What have I got to do with Aunt Fanny 's father ? " she asked . " The old boy 's dead fifteen years . " Miss Ogilvie laughed again , glanced at Essex , and then leaned forward . " I suppose I had better be the one to tell you , " she said . " Good morning , Aunt Fanny , " Mrs. Willow said ; the sun was shining goldenly on the terrace where Aunt Fanny and Maryjane were sitting after breakfast , " good morning to you.  |p56And  to you , " she said , to Maryjane . " Are you the mother of that delightful child ? My gels are both in love with her already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aunt Fanny said with satisfaction . " The table was cleared an hour ago . " " I 'll run along down the kitchen in a minute . They will be sure to have something for a starving old woman . How well your brother is looking , Aunt Fanny . I am quite surprised to see how well he looks . " " He has had a blow recently , ma'am ; he could scarcely look very well . " " A blow indeed , " Maryjane said darkly . " Unmotherlymonster. "  --  I ?  --  " A mother , " Maryjane explained , " who pushes her only son down the stairs and leaves his devoted wife a widow . " " Maryjane , " Aunt Fanny said . " Not before this lady , please . " " A widow , " Maryjane said . " A fatherless orphan . " " I 'm very sorry to hear it , " Mrs. Willow said inadequately , and then , in a rush to Aunt Fanny , " I think you were away when I visited here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this house , and the kindness of your father . " " My father was an upright , courteous man . " Mrs. Willow 's voice was saddened . " You will certainly not believe this , but his passing was a deep personal loss to me . I valued him more than I can say ; a truly upright man , as you say . " " You are right , " Aunt Fanny said . " I certainly do not believe that . " " Aunt Fanny , " said Mrs. Willow , " I do not want to keep on offending you . I have the greatest admiration and fondness for every member of your family , and so do my two daughters . " " And well you should , " Aunt Fanny said . " I was not brought up to make friends out of my own class , Mrs. Willow . "  | " But there are to be no more differing classes , are there ? " " What do you mean ? " " Miss Ogilvie told us last night of the joyful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have been very much favored . " " Good heavens , " said Aunt Fanny . " She actually told you ? " " I thought your father instructed specifically that all within the house were among the . . . ah . . . blessed . We have come , my daughters and I , in very good time . " " Good heavens , " Aunt Fanny said again . " Good heavens . " " Yes , " Maryjane said , " it is quite true . I am to have no more asthma . Aunt Fanny 's father said clearly that sickness , like my asthma , would vanish from the earth . I will never have asthma again , after the world has been cleansed . " After a minute Aunt Fanny spoke faintly . " I have never disobeyed my father , " she said . " His instructions were quite clear ; perhaps I was wrong in not telling you myself . Mrs. Willow , you and your daughters are  --  " Aunt Fanny gasped , and nearly choked "  --  welcome here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Willow said gravely . " We will try to deserve your kindness . And now , " she said , " I think I will dig up a little breakfast , and then drop in on old Orianna and pass the time of day . " Mrs. Willow settled herself dubiously into a delicate flowered armchair and relaxed slowly , listening for cracks in the wood . " Orianna , " she said , " you know perfectly well you ought to do something for me , me and my gels . " " Girls , " Mrs. Halloran said . She had been working at the household accounts when Mrs. Willow interrupted her , and she kept one hand protectively on her pen , but without optimism . " Girls , if you please . "  | " My little affectations , " Mrs. Willow said . " You know perfectlywell you will have to do something for me . " " And your daughters . Gels .

There 's no denying , for instance , that my clever Julia is a fool and my lovely Arabella is a  --  " " Flirt , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Well , I was going to say tart , but it 's your house , after all . Anyway , it 's money we need , as if there was ever anything else . I do n't figure there 's any way you can come right out and give us some , but people as rich as you are must know other people as rich as you are and somewhere along the line there must be someone you can help us get a dime out of . Marriage would be best , of course ; we might as well aim high while we 're about it . It better be Belle , though ; she 's prettier and if you tell her anything enough times she 'll do it eventually . Besides if Belle married money the chances are good I could ease a little of it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this young characterwith the little kid ? " " She 's what my son Lionel married . " " God almighty . " Mrs. Willow was wistful . " All his money . Even so , though , I do n't think I would have wished it on either of my girls , even Julia . On account of you , I mean ; there 's no sense taking you on just to get our hands on enough money to try and live . I think , " Mrs. Willow said , " I 'd rather die , actually . No offense intended , of course . She talks a lot , does n't she ? " " Maryjane ? " " Have n't you heard the kind of things she says ? " Mrs. Halloran laughed , and Mrs. Willow nodded , and sighed . " Now that 's no way to go about it , " she said sadly ,  | " you imagine me in a soft spot like that ? What does she think it 's going to get her ? " " Perhaps it helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gels , " Mrs. Willow said with feeling , " I 'd see that she managed it altogether different ; she 's got the kid , after all , and there 's no one else , you 've got to leave it to the kid unless she fouls it up somehow . She could be talking the kid right out of everything ; what she wants to do is keep her mouth shut until it counts . Well . " She sighed . " You always see other people getting the good chances . " " You might tell your daughter Arabella that Essex is penni-less . " " What ? " Mrs. Willow glanced up sharply . " Yes ? Well , I 'll tell her . You know , " she went on slowly , " they 're not bad girls . That is , " she said unwillingly , " they 're probably bad girls the way we understood it when you and I were bad girls . . . I mean , bad . But they 're not dishonest , or unkind . Not bad girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You remember , do you ? Then you see they do deserve some kind of help ? After all . . . " Mrs. Willow shrugged , and was silent . After a minute or so , during which Mrs. Halloran regainedher pen hopefully , Mrs. Willow went on , " I tell you , Orianna , I 've got to get rid of those girls ; every time some young fellow looks twice at Belle or dances with Julia my hands start to shake and I get so anxious my teeth chatter . I just ca n't afford them much longer , and you can see as well as I do that they 're not up to most of the competition they meet ; Belle 's past twenty-five and even her hairdresser  --  " " I suppose it 's too late for them to learn shorthand ? " " It 's almost too late for them to learn new dances , " Mrs. Willow said sullenly . In a fever of irritation she put out her cigarette and got up to pace furiously up and down the satinp60room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'd take anybody . Even somebody penniless . If he had rich friends . " There was a long silence . Mrs. Willow walked back and forth , eyeing the draperies , the jade cigarette box , the fine thin legs of the furniture . Mrs. Halloran stared down at her desk , at her unfinished accounts . Then Mrs. Willow said abruptly , " What a hell of a thing to do , " and Mrs. Halloran raised her head . " Orianna , " Mrs. Willow said , " what is this ? " Mrs. Halloran turned curiously , and Mrs. Willow said , " Look at this thing . It 's disgusting . What 's the idea ? " " Augusta , " Mrs. Halloran said , " I can generally follow your conversation , since it rarely departs from one or two favorite subjects . But I confess that at present  --  " " Look , then , damn it . If you do n't want people to see it why do you leave it standing there ? " Mrs. Willow brought it over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hatpin pushed through the tinted throat so that the pin stood out wickedly behind the photograph and the rhinestone head of the pin sparkled like a huge diamond against the throat of Mrs. Halloran in the photograph . " Dear me , " said Mrs. Halloran . She took the photograph in her hand and looked at it thoughtfully . Then , " No , " she said , handing it back , " I have no idea how it got there . " " Hell of a practical joke , " said Mrs. Willow , pulling at the hatpin . " Hardly get it out . " " Then leave it in , " Mrs. Halloran said indifferently . " It gives me the creeps . There . " Mrs. Willow set the picture down and the hatpin on the low table beside it . " Well , " she said , running her finger carefully along the picture frame , " do you think you can ? " " Can what , Augusta ? " " Do a little something for my gels  --  girls ? Not much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be an opening here for a housemaid . " " I 'm not an idiot , " Mrs. Willow said slowly , " at least not idiot enough to threaten you . I did n't go , . sticking a hatpin through your picture  --  " " That was probably Fancy ; she 's been told not to come in here . " "  --  and yet it seems to me that you could use a friend or so , and particularly someone who 's known you a long time and does n't have anything to lose by you , only something to gain . But you might as well know that your sister Fanny  --  " " Who has n't a cent . " "  --  has bidden us welcome to this house ; we may stay as long as we like . " Mrs. Halloran turned , staring . " Did she tell you ? " " Put it , " Mrs. Willow said carefully , " that either we hustle off with a little check in our hands , or we stay , and  --  " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " I will not pay you to go , certainly . " Mrs. Halloran 's voice was quiet . " And I will not go against Aunt Fanny , although I believe she is sadly mistaken here . Yet , " she said sadly , " you and I have so little else to hope for . "  |p62MRS  . HALLORAN , who was a tired and sometimes lonely person , sat by herself in her room before the thin-legged desk ; it was late evening , her accounts still undone , and distantly she could hear the voices of the other people in the house , and sometimes laughter . Only human beings and rabid animals turn on their own kind , she was thinking ; gratuitous pain is unknownin nature . At what point , she wondered , could I have been brought to deny myself all this ? Lose the house ? How could I have turned aside ? And could I bear to lose it now ? She told them over softly . Richard , Fanny , Maryjane , Fancy . Augusta Willow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really die ? she wondered , and then , resolute , turned to her accounts . All things must be neat and shipshape at her hands ; even if the world outside withered and dissolved Mrs. Halloran would face a new world , herself in order , and balanced , relinquishingnothing of what was her own . Downstairs , they were in the library . In his room Mr. Halloranslept , his nurse nodding beside him , but in the library Aunt Fanny and Mrs. Willow were playing bridge against Miss Ogilvie and Julia , while Maryjane told Arabella the plot of a movie she had recently seen , and Essex , constrained by Aunt Fanny , advised the play.  | " These are not new cards , " Aunt Fanny said , turning her hand over . " There should always be new cards in the card cupboard , Essex . " " I 'm afraid I took them out , " Miss Ogilvie said . " I took the first I came to . " " We must have new cards for my deal , " Aunt Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , Aunt Fanny . " " My father never touched a soiled card . " " I dealt . " Mrs. Willow overrode Aunt Fanny . She looked deeply into her hand , sighed , thought , adjusted a card , sighed again , and put her cards down on the table . " Pass , " she said . " Will Orianna be down tonight ? " " I hardly think so , " Essex said . " She is adding up how much we all cost her , " Maryjane said . " Every time she goes up to look over the bills I wish I had bought more in the village . " " Who dealt ? " Miss Ogilvie asked . " He was a doctor in this movie , " Mary jane said to Arabella , " you know , with a white coat and devoted to his profession ? And his wife , you know ? " " I guess I pass , " Miss Ogilvie said . " Really , partner ! " Julia said ; she was prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts , " Aunt Fanny said . " Essex , come and look at this hand . " " Two ? " Mrs. Willow said . " Two hearts , partner ? Essex , does she really mean two hearts ? " " Mrs. Willow , I was taught bridge by a professional . My father believed that no expense should be spared on my education . Bridge , dancing , lessons in drawing and on the harp . Italian . Astronomy  --  " " Four spades , " said Julia in some haste.  | " Julia , pet , you interrupt Aunt Fanny . " " What does four spades mean ? " Miss Ogilvie asked . " Essex , what does she mean by four spades ? " Aunt Fanny went on . " I was only trying to explain that my education was not , as you sometimes seem to believe , wholly neglected . I was not , perhaps , a diligent student , but that impliesno criticism of my father , whose only aim was to see me a cultivated , gracious woman .

" Now , Mrs. Willow , you know better . " " I shall of course withdraw my bid , " Aunt Fanny said stiffly . " Not at all , " Miss Ogilvie said . " We would n't dream  --  " " I was taught by a professional , Miss Ogilvie . If my partnerreveals her hand , intentionally or unintentionally  --  " " Essex , " Miss Ogilvie said , " what shall I do ?

" I stand corrected , " Aunt Fanny said . " I was under the impression that one 's first bid was of the suit one intended . I amp65happy to know that I have been wrong all these years , and so , of course , was the professional teacher from whom I learned . I have not , of course , kept up with the newer tules , so I am now aware of a kind of bid I had always thought illegal .

" " Mrs. Willow , " said Essex gravely , " will you have a cigar ? " "  --  and then , of course , all the other natives , and I wish you could have seen it ; he was so tall and dignified , and yet he was so happy , too , and in spite of his wife  --  " " I will have a drink , however , " Mrs. Willow said.

" " A pleasant way to wait , " Mrs. Willow said , looking at the light through her drink . " Nothing is actually quite concrete , " Essex said ; the absencep66of Mrs. Halloran made him a little free and he was , in any case , slightly drunk . " We can not concern ourselves with anythingof this world , and we are far from achieving the next ; Aunt Fanny , is there nothing we can do ? " " I am tired of waiting , myself , Essex . But my father said we would be told in time . I think , " said Aunt Fanny , with an unusualburst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer resort , waiting for their vacations to end . We have never had anything to do , you know , but now we are waiting besides , and it is almost unbearable . " " Reality , " Essex said . " Reality . What is real , Aunt Fanny ?

" Miss Ogilvie looked for help to Mrs. Willow , to Julia . " I could n't really say , not having had that much experience . Well . . . food , I guess . " " Maryjane , " said Essex , " what is reality ? " " What ? " Maryjane stared with her mouth open . " You mean , something real , like something not in the movies ?

" Observation , perhaps , " Essex said , wickedly . " Recollection . Intention , desire , mystic perception of the absence of nothingness . I am going to be sorry that I ever named the subject . "  | " If you are talking about one of my gels I can promise you that you will be sorry , Master Insolence . " " Mrs. Willow , I was talking about yourself .

" " What kind of tests ? " Miss Ogilvie could not be stopped . " You mean . . . intelligence tests ? " She glanced around , blushing . " I mean , " she explained , " the more we know about such things the better able we are . . . " Her voice trailed off , as though even Miss Ogilvie could not contemplate an increase in her own abilities ; even a test of intelligence , the silence said clearly , would not appreciably profit Miss Ogilvie . " Well , reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is money . A roof over your head , of course , and a little something three times a day and maybe a drop to drink . But mostly money . Clothes .

" and now it sounded as though Mrs. Willow might be saying " May wine , " or even possibly " tropical moonlight , " and she gave a happy little sigh . " Fortune telling , " Essex said to Miss Ogilvie . " Intelligence tests  --  palmistry  --  tea reading  --  projective tests  --  " " I adore them , " Julia said . Can we ?

" I 've seen many a good woman waste the little bit she had left on nothing but a white shadow with a creepy voice , calling and crying over it and spending her life and even her money wastingaway to nothing but a shadow herself . Mediums , you know , " Mrs. Willow said in explanation to Miss Ogilvie , who had her mouth open again . " Mediums preying . " " Good heavens , " said Miss Ogilvie . " You surely can not mean to include me with  --  " " Well , Aunt Fanny , the way I see it you 're a lady , and a lady is n't going to tell lies about her own father . I like to think I 've got an open mind on any subject , but I sure as almighty hell wish I 'd been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " Julia said . " I 'd really die , " Arabella said . Essex said rather sternly , " Aunt Fanny is not a medium or a charlatan , Mrs. Willow . " " Lord , dear , I never said she was . I 'm curious , is all ; there 's a lot more I need to know about all this . And who the devil , " she went on , " are you ? " " How do you do . " Mrs. Willow 's voice had been so level that no one had turned , accustomed by now to her grasshopper speech ; when they heard another , a strange voice , answer , all of them were startled and wheeled toward the doorway , all except Miss Ogilvie , who assumed immediately that Mrs. Willow had success/fully raised an apparition ( perhaps Aunt Fanny 's father , come to undertake his own defense , and Miss Ogilvie having showed surprise ; even , perhaps . . . skepticism ) . Miss Ogilive gasped and covered her eyes . " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little shocked by the promptness with which she had summoned a stranger into Mrs. Halloran 's library ; almost lowering her voice Mrs. Willow went on , " Are you looking for someone ? " " Knock twice for yes , once for no , " Essex murmured . " Mrs. Halloran ? " Thus adequately convinced of either the mortal simplicity of the appearance before her , or  --  not impossibly  --  the utter lack of an adequate intelligence system among the inhabitants of another world , Mrs. Willow laughed and said in her normal voice , " Mrs. Halloran has retired . Can I help you ? " " I 'm Gloria Desmond . " " Gloria . " Mrs. Willow inclined her head regally . " I am AugustaWillow . My daughters , Arabella and Julia . Mr. Essex . Miss Ogilvie . Miss Frances Halloran . " Aunt Fanny came forward ; she had , after all , had more ghostly experience than any of them . " I am Miss Halloran , " she said . " My brother is resting , and my sister-in-law is engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see her tonight . If I can  --  " " I will be glad to send up a message , " Mrs. Willow , said , moving in . " What did you want to see her about ? " " I have a letter for her . " " What does it say ? " Mrs. Willow inquired . " It asks if I can stay here with her till my father comes home . " " Who wrote it ? " " My father did . He 's Mrs. Halloran 's cousin . " " Unusually ladylike for that family , " Aunt Fanny told Missp70Ogilvie , who , somewhat reassured , was staring with her mouth open . " Where did he go , your father ? " " Africa . " " What for ? " " To shoot lions , of course . " " What on earth for ? " said Mrs. Willow blankly . " Some people shoot lions , " the girl said pleasantly , " and some people do not shoot lions . My father is one of the people who do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? " " Seventeen . " " Where did you come from ? " " My home . In Massachusetts . " " How did you get here ? " " By plane . My father left for Africa yesterday and before he left he wrote this letter to Mrs. Halloran asking if she would put me up until he gets back because the people I was supposed to stay with had a death in the family and so my father put me on the plane and said Mrs. Halloran had written him once askinghim to come for a visit and he supposed the invitation was still open and there was n't time to telegraph or anything becausewe thought I would be here practically by the time the telegram arrived . We did not know , " the girl went on , " that I would get off the plane and have to take a two-hour bus trip and then a taxi from your village and then climb over a locked gate and walk in these shoes up a thousand miles of drive and then bang on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come to this room where I heard voices and then stand here answering a million silly questions before anyone even told me I could put my suitcase down but now I think I will put my suitcase down and take off my shoes and then if you have any more questions  --  "  | " It 's because we thought you were a ghost , " Arabella explainedhelpfully . " A ghost ? Why would I be a ghost ? " " We have had a death in this family , too , " Aunt Fanny said . " You have come to a house of mourning , child . But I am surethat my brother will welcome you , even in his grief . " " You really climbed over the gate ? " Essex asked . " When I am visiting a place , " Gloria said , " I do n't like beinglocked out , even if they do n't know I 'm coming . " " The least your father could do , " Mrs. Halloran said pleasantlyto Gloria at the breakfast table , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it when we were girls , " Mrs. Willow said . " It 's very easy , and very accurate . And of course , needing informationthe way we do  --  " " My father  --  " " I 'm not saying a word against him , dearie . Only he does seem kind of . . . vague . Inconclusive . What we want to know is who , what , where , when , and how . And this is how to do it . " " I am not sure , " Aunt Fanny said , " that my father would agree ... " " Only trouble is , " Mrs. Willow said , " and of course it 's not really a trouble , but we need a virgin . " " That is a subject , " Mrs. Halloran said with unseemly haste , " which , if pursued , could only develop into low comedy . I suggest we turn our minds to something else at once . " " We used to do it when we were girls , " Mrs. Willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the wall and set it near the fire , checking earnestly to make sure that there was no glare of reflected light . Next to the table she put a straight , stiff chair , which had perhaps never been sat upon before . It came from a dark corner of the drawing room , andp72was upholstered in dead green satin . Its legs were carved and gilded ; it was clearly uncomfortable and slippery . " The mirror , " Mrs. Willow said . " Bring the one on the wall there , Essex . " She laughed . " It 's reflected all of us so many times it must know our faces by now . " Essex brought the mirror , awkwardly ; when he took it down from the wall it was unexpectedlyheavy , and Mrs. Willow had to leap forward to catch it before it fell . Mrs. Halloran , stony-faced , looked for a minute at the darker spot on the silvered wallpaper which the mirror had left behind . " Some of these things , " Mrs. Halloran said , " have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't doubt it , " Mrs. Willow agreed amiably . " You should have this room done over , dear . It 's perfectly impossible . " Then , reflecting , she went on , " Although that sounds silly , now , does n't it ? Because even if you wanted to do it over , why bother ? For such a short time , probably , I mean , and afterward , of course , there wo n't be anyone to do it . " " I have always liked it the way it is , " Mrs. Halloran said . Mrs. Willow and Essex put the mirror down onto the table and it reflected dutifully the carved cupids and painted clouds of the ceiling . The heavy frame of the mirror was gilded , and there was an expensive fault in the glass , so that a wave seeminglypassed across it , altering the cupid faces and giving a look of sea-depth ; Mrs. Willow had taken from the kitchen a small can of imported olive oil , and now she carefully poured a little onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the mirror caught light and shone . " Now , " Mrs. Willow said , lookingaround the room . " Low comedy , " Mrs. Halloran murmured . " Essex , do you volunteer ? " " I have an antipathy to mirrors , " Essex said.  | " What do I have to do ? " Gloria came forward . " Just look in the glass ? " " As though it were a window , " Mrs. Willow said , and Gloria sat down gingerly on the green satin chair . Gloria giggled , and Mrs. Willow put her hand on Gloria 's head , protectively , and said in a steady tone , " Rest your arms on the table on either side of the window . Put your face down close to the window and keep your eyes wide . Try not to blink . Try not to think . We will all be very quiet , and in a little while you will see through the window to what is on the other side . When you see something there , just tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see anything ? " " Then someone else will try . We used to do this all the time , dear , when we were girls . Now , everyone , sit well away from Gloria , so you will not cast a shadow . And be quiet , if you please . " Mrs. Halloran , with the air of one divorcing herself from a dull parlor trick , although one which had been perfectly acceptablewhen she was a girl , sat in her usual chair by the fire , and Essex sat near her . Julia and Arabella sat together , prettily , upon a rose-colored sofa near the fire , and Miss Ogilvie took a place in a far corner , as befitted one in a humble station and not expected to be the first to face any danger . Mrs. Willow and Aunt Fanny hovered near Gloria , silently pressing one another to move back . Gloria leaned her head forward , and her long hair fell down along either cheek . " It hurts your eyes , " she said . " Gloria , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a window , a strange window because it looks out onto a world you have never seen before . It is dark there now , perhaps , because on the other side they still have not found the way to the window , but remember , when they know the window is there they will come to speak to us . You are waiting at thisp74window to be given a vital message . Be alert , child , be ready ; remember that you are on guard at this window and when they come you must be prepared to see them . " " Please do n't breathe on my neck , " Gloria said . " Gloria , " Aunt Fanny said , " can you see my father ? Tall , very pale ? " " I can see the sundial , I think , " Gloria said hesitantly . " No , it is not the sundial . It is a white rock . There is water around it  --  no grass . It is like the sundial because it stands there alone with grass all around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A trysting place , " said Mrs. Willow with satisfaction . " Not on my land , " Mrs. Halloran said firmly . " Now the rock is a mountain . And the grass is tops of trees . There is water running down the mountain ; it is a waterfall . Like one of those toys  --  everything shifts and changes , and by the time I see something it is gone . Now it is the sun , very bright . It hurts my eyes . A fire . White . All over , covering everything , even the trees and the waterfall . And colors , red and black . I 've got to close my eyes . " She put both hands over her eyes and Mrs. Willow sighed . " It was my father , almost certainly , " Aunt Fanny said . " Very bright . " Gloria leaned forward again and said , " It 's still there , only getting darker . Circles of color , blacker and blacker . No , no , stop , " she said , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to watch , " she said , staring . " Like eyes , eyes all looking , they are going to get out  --  they are going to get out  --  shut the window against them , quick  --  shut the mirror , before they get out ! No , wait , " and without looking away she waved Mrs. Willow back , " it 's quiet now . They ca n't get out . The others are there . Standing , in a row . Looking at us . They want something . "  | " Who do they want ? " It was Miss Ogilvie from her corner , straining against her chair as though tied . " It is the house . They were standing all a row and now it is the windows of the house ; it looks tiny . It looks like a tiny picture , barely colored . The sun is not shining . There is a bird walking down the terrace , even from here I can see how bright he is , red and blue and green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the terrace , " Mrs. Halloran said . " My father-in-law thought them feeble-minded . " " It is walking down the terrace and now down the steps onto the lawn . Blue , and green . Tiny , and bright . It is coming straight down the lawn , right at me . I think it sees me and is coming right at me . It has a sharp nose and red eyes and it is smiling , bright and colored and coming faster  --  make him stop  --  make him go away  --  it 's hideous  --  make him go away ! " Gloria wrenched away from the table and covered her eyes . Mrs. Willow patted her shoulder and said , " A little brandy , Essex , please , " and looked over Gloria 's shoulder into the mirror skimmed with oil , reflecting distorted cupids and dirty clouds . " I am sure that it was my father , " Aunt Fanny said . " I would not look into that mirror , of course , but it is not necessary . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if we are mindful of his instructions . Do n't be afraid , " she said to Gloria . " That was my father you saw . " " It was awful , " Gloria said . " He was always a very strict man , " Aunt Fanny said , " but good to his children . If I had been in your place , Gloria , I should have said something , or at least made some gesture to show you recognized him . Because of course he has his feelings , too . "  |p76You  are not familiar , I think , " Essex said slowly , " with a kind of unholy , unspeakable longing ? I mention it to you because I think you may be the only person here who is capable of recognizing such an emotion . It is not a pretty thing to feel . " " Perhaps you might teach me , " Arabella said . " It is a longing so intense that it creates what it desires , it can not endure any touch of correction ; it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Arabella , " I do not think I can remember that I ever felt anything like that . " " It is unholy because it is heretic . It is foul . It is abominable to need something so badly that you can not picture living withoutit . It is a contradiction to the condition of mankind . " " I have always lived very well , you see , " Arabella said . " My mother has made a particular point of seeing that I lacked for nothing . " " I dread that it may be only a longing for annihilation . No person who has seen his own face plain can want to live longer . " " Well , I ca n't understand that . I mean , I can understand a person 's not liking his own face , but people ca n't help their faces , after all . I know I always feel very sorry for girls who are not nice-looking . And I 'm sure I think you 've got a very pleasantface. "  | " The sight of one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look inward  --  that 's why they 've been given bodies , to hide their souls . " " Of course , I was very lucky , and please do n't think I believe it was anything but luck ; beauty is only an accident , like the way a person is born . " " I am filthy , sickened , beastly . I have seen myself plain . " " My sister Julia , on the other hand  --  " " I am rotten ; that is why I am so frightened  --  I am terribly afraid that this hope which Aunt Fanny  --  " " Aunt Fanny , " said Arabella , " you 're talking about Aunt Fanny ? But I thought all your unspeakable thoughts were about me . " " Well , I do n't care what the old biddy says , " Julia said , takingthe turn by the gates in a wide sweep of the steering wheel , and barely slowing the car , " I 'd go anywhere I pleased . " " It 's very difficult , " Miss Ogilvie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being dependent , I suppose it 's the least we can do , not asking to have the gates unlocked . " " Not me , " Julia said . " You saw the way I take care of things ; I just told him it was all right with the old lady , and maybe he thought I was taking you two to church or something , because he would n't dare to keep me inside . " " I merely do not choose , often , to leave my home , " Aunt Fanny observed from the back seat . " Your modern automobiles ... particularly this one ; Julia , do you mind moving just a little more slowly ? Automobiles , and noise and dust and strange people . . . I prefer a somewhat less feverish life , thank you . " " What will she say when she hears you two have been gallivantingaround ? " Julia asked , peering at them in the rear-view mirror . " I do not gallivant around , " Aunt Fanny said , and Missp78Ogilvie said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless you tell her . " " I keep your secrets , " Julia said darkly , " and you keep mine . " Although the fact had probably not influenced the first Mr. Halloran in his choice of a site for his house , the village had been , shortly before his time , very much the subject of sensationalpublicity . Young Harriet Stuart , it was generally believed , had one morning arisen unusually early in the Stuart house just outside the village , and taken up a hammer with which she murdered her father , her mother , and her two younger brothers , putting an abrupt end to the Stuart family tree . Fall River , Massachusetts , was nothing to the villagers near Mr. Halloran 's proposed big house ; Harriet Stuart was their enshrined murderess . During Harriet 's arrest and trial , the villagers met more strangers than had ever come their way before , and after Harriet'sacquittal it was customary for almost daily groups of tourists to get off the bus in front of the Carriage Stop Inn , and wander , guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuart house , where they were occasionaly rewarded by a fleeting glimpse of Harriet 's housekeeper and guardian , an aunt who must sometimes have wondered if Harriet 's hammer days were over , working in the garden or taking in the groceries . Sometimesthe most persistent , staying past the departure of the second bus ( and thus making necessary a night spent in the arms of the Carriage Stop Inn ) were able to catch sight of a tall figure dressed in black , moving past the upper windows of the house . The village story , no matter who was lucky enough to capture the tourists , seldom varied : " They could n't prove it on her , see , because no one knew why she did it , and being fifteen years old and all , she got off . They said at the time it was a crazy idea she was even put on trial , because no jury in their right minds couldp79see her sitting there , quiet and sad and looking like any young kid , and really believe she did it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , and her two J rothers besides , and even we could n't think , sometimes , she was up to it . Now right here , right along these bushes here by the road , is where she fell when she said she was running for help , and here 's where they found the hammer later , and she said it was a tramp chasing her , one got in through the back cellar window and he must have dropped the hammer here . She run all the way down the road to Parker 's Bakery yelling for help . Later we 'll go round the back and look through the fence and you can see the window she said the tramp got in at , even though they said , the prosecution , it had n't been opened for years , but the defense got an expert said there were clear signs someone had been walking around the cellar near the window . Right there , that window on the second floor third from the end , that was the window of the room where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there now  --  remorse , or something . Or maybe it just has the best bed , though not many people would want to sleep in that bed , I guess  --  it 's where she did them in , you know . The two boys were around back , we can see their window when we go around . Her room was on the very end , down there , and they say she got up when it was still dark and she had the hammer with her  --  took it to bed with her the night before , you know  --  and came right down the hall to her parent 's bedroom and wham ! Then , across the hall to the boys . Wham again . Nothing to it , says Harriet . Then , down the stairs , and down the front walk , left the gate open , fell into the bushes back where I showed you , dropped the hammer , and down the road in her nightgown to Parker 's Bakery ; Bill Parker , he did n't believe her at first  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head out of the window and told her to go home . Then she told him again and he got some pants on and got up Straus the butcher and oldp80Watkins and they went up  --  before you take the bus you go sea old Watkins ; he 'll tell you what it looked like when they got up here . One funny thing  --  she was barefoot and all cut and scratched from the bushes when Mrs. Parker took her in , but no blood on her . The prosecution , they said she could n't hardly do such a set of things as that without getting blood on her , and they say she did it and then washed herself and put on a clean nightgown . The prosecution said she burned the bloody nightgownin the stove , but the defense , they got in an expert said it was n't nothing but old rags in the stove , even though no one said why anyone wanted to go burning old rags ; round here , we mostly take our old junk over to the dump , although you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our old rags . " No one ever knew , though . She got off , and she came back here to the house where she was born , and she lives there now . Goes out for walks at night , they say , although me , I would n't like to meet her  --  ca n't tell what might happen if she come to take a dislike to you . Funny thing , though , Straus  --  he 's the butcher  --  says they never order meat , though they used to . A vegetarian , Harriet Stuart . " Come around the side and I 'll show you the shed the hammercome from , and then we 'll look through the fence and maybe get a look at Auntie and anyway see those other windows . He was a carpenter , Stuart  --  built most of this place himself , though Harriet had the fence put up , of course , after she come home . Used to be kids throwing rocks through the windows , sometimes , or yelling things from the road . Seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them to respect other people and other people 's property . " Harriet Stuart died quietly in her sleep some ten or twelve years after Mr. Halloran had built the big house , her aunt removedto another town and was known to have changed herp81name , and the Stuart house stayed empty . No one was willing to live in it because of its lack of sanitary accommodations , and the villagers kept it in repair because tourists came to look at it . The fence was taken down , and it was not thought in doubtful taste to tack neatly lettered little signs upon the doors to the significant rooms , and set a small metal standard beside the bush where the hammer was found . The villagers tried valiantly to pretend that the house was haunted , and occasionally Mr. Straus , who had re-taken possession of the property when the Stuart mortgage lapsed , received letters from scholarly folk who wanted to visit the house in order to write gently humorous , cynical articles proving that Harriet Stuart was innocent , or that she was guilty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet place , untouched by time or progress . " The present Mr. Straus , who owned the butcher shop , was the son of the original Mr. Straus who owned the butcher shop and had gone with Mr. Parker and old Watkins to the Stuart house ; the present Mr. Straus had heard the Harriet Stuart story so often from his father that he could repeat it , now , without hesitation , when people came by the shop and asked him ; he knew perfectly where the blood had been spilled and how Mrs. Stuart had made it halfway to the door before the hammer caught up with her , and he could recreate , with telling effect , the look in the dead eyes of Mr. Stuart , gazing with horror upon his murderer ; his pathetic recital of how the two young boys were found in one another 's arms was very apt to move his hearers to tears . The Stuart house was listed in local guide books as a spot of some grisly interest . Mr. Peabody , when he took over the Carriage Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of renaming the Inn the Harriet Stuart Lodge , but had been dissuaded by the sterner heads in town , and particularlythe Misses Inverness , who ran the gift shop next to the Inn , and who regarded the entire Harriet Stuart affair as un/couth , and criminally unfilial . No curios or mementos of the Stuart family were to be found in the gift shop run by the Misses Inverness , although several books discussing the murder were in the Inn library , and a rude pamphlet , purporting to be the work of one of the party who visited the house that night , was on sale in several shops in the village ; it gave a vivid and gory description of the house , and had sketches of Harriet Stuart , her unfortunate family , and a map of the probable route she had taken from arising that morning to her eventual arrival at Parker 's Bakery . Harriet Stuart lured a small regular stream of tourists to the village ; two busses a day stopped in front of the Carriage Stop Inn , and there was time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a country-style dinner at the Inn , with a few minutes for browsing with the Misses Inverness , and a walk down the one street of the village to purchase homemade jelly and preserves in Mrs. Martin 's little shop , regard the site of Parker 's Bakery , now , with Parker , defunct ; look at antiques in the big barn back of the Basses ' house , and inspect , with shudders , the Stuart family memorial in the cemetery , which gave no more than the names of the murdered family and , horribly , their one common date of death . Most of the villagers managed to sell a little something to tourists , and keep their own small businesses besides . Miss Bass , sister to the Mr. Bass who kept antiques in his barn , gave lessons in piano and voice . Mrs. Otis , whom people believed to be a divorced woman living upon alimony , gave dancing lessons and did hair . The village children went to a one-room school , taught for the past seventeenyears by a Miss Comstock ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her predecessor , by the Halloran family . The first Mr. Halloran had been responsible for the further education , in college , in medical school , in law school , or in art school , of those village children who showed promise ; the present Mrs.p83Halloran had continued this policy , but teachable children were getting fewer every year ; those young people sent away to collegehad , of course , never come back , and the village grew smaller and older , although the Harriet Stuart stories were handed down as faithfully as the several small annuities from the Halloran family . Mr. Halloran had once made an offer to buy the Stuart house and land , but Mr. Straus had firmly refused , and as a result  --  the first Mr. Halloran disliking not beingable to buy something he wanted  --  the Stuart legends were not discussed by the Hallorans , and naturally tourists were never admitted inside the walls of the big house . The Hallorans made a particular point of bringing as much of their trade as possible to the village ; they bought their meat from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen over the Stuart holding , and had much of their dressmaking and simple sewing done by old Mrs. Martin , who also made the homemade jellies and jams and an occasional pie upon order . Although the Halloran house received regular deliveries from the big stores in the city , nine miles away , they placed a standing order for groceries from Mr. Hawthorne , borrowed their books from the lending library in the gift shop run by the Misses Inverness , sent down for the mail from Mr. Armstrong , the postmaster , took their petty hardwarefrom Atkins Hardware , and bought , as far as possible , fresh eggs and chickens and vegetables and fruit from the farmers who were legitimately part of the village . On one point , however , the first Mr. Halloran had made an unbreakablelaw : the servants in the big house came , without exception , from the city . Villagers , Mr. Halloran maintained , belonged in the village , and not within the walls of the big house . Julia parked the car at the main corner of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Any place in particular ? " she asked . " The nearest subway station , maybe ? "  | " I plan to visit every shop in the village , " Aunt Fanny said stiffly . " Aside from certain preparations which must be made , I feel it incumbent upon me to make one or two last purchases from each shop ; a gesture of some importance , as I see it . The villagers must see that we do not break faith with them , even now . " " What about Miss Ogilvie here ? " Julia asked . " You do n't mean her to come with me , I suppose ? " " I will accompany Aunt Fanny , " Miss Ogilvie said . " Perhaps I shall drop in at the lending library and browse . " " And you , Julia ? " Aunt Fanny asked . " Can you amuse yourselffor an hour at least , perhaps even an hour and a half ? I hesitate to propose the lending library . " " I 'll find something to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Just getting out of that house is enough . " " Those two young men you are looking at in that field are the Watkins brothers , " Aunt Fanny said tartly . " Good for nothing , both of them . They may look as though they are lying in the shade under a tree , but they will tell you that they are actuallyout shooting rabbit , or picking apples , or some such nonsense . The Halloran family arranged for the older one to drive one of the dairy trucks from the city , but at the end of a month or so he left them , although they could never actually prove that he had made off with the collection money . " " I would n't dream of going near them , " Julia said . " I 'll meet you right here in an hour and a half . " " Perhaps , " Miss Ogilvie suggested timidly , " Julia would be interested in seeing  --  I know I have always wanted to  --  in seeing the Harriet  --  " " Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suppose that even Julia would be guilty of such self-indulgence . Julia , I would recommend the cemetery . There are several old markers , the oldest in this part of the country . The Halloran familyp85vault is particularly well-carved ; my father and mother rest there . " " The cemetery , " Julia said . " Naturally . Will I have trouble finding it ? " " I hardly think so , " Aunt Fanny said . " The last building on your right is the church . The cemetery is just beyond it . " " If I get lost , " Julia said , " I will ask a policeman . " She drove off , going slowly , and Aunt Fanny and Miss Ogilviestood for a minute , looking after her . Then Aunt Fanny settled herself briskly and said , " Miss Ogilvie , as I told you , I have really a good deal to do . I must not lose time . I have alreadysent off a great many orders to stores in the city , and todayI must complete my shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " said Miss Ogilvie . " I mean  --  " she blushed "  --  why do you have to buy things now , when . . . when ... " " Dear Miss Ogilvie . There are so many things one is reluctant to leave behind . Even you must perceive that we do not know , yet , what we shall wish , afterward , that we had brought with us , and there will be no coming back , afterward , to collectitems we have forgotten . " " Food , " said Miss Ogilvie , nodding . " I understand . " " I have absolute faith in my father . But we must try to think of everything . " " Perhaps I can help , then , " Miss Ogilvie said . " At least , I can help you carry your packages . " " Carry packages ? I ? " " Small things . . . " Miss Ogilvie made a helpless gesture . " Miss Ogilvie , please do try to be more sensible . I can not stand here in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village , trying to teach you the habits of a lady . I have really no time at all to spend reasoning with you . " Purposefully , Auntp86Fanny crossed the street and went into the hardware store , Miss Ogilvie following wretchedly . After the hardware store , Aunt Fanny visited the grocery and then the little shop where Mrs. Martin sold her jams and jellies and yard goods and an occasional pie upon order . When they left old Mrs. Martin , Miss Ogilvie hesitated and glanced wistfully across the street . " The lending library , " she said apologetically . " Something to pass the time , you know . I do n't suppose , " she added with a flash at Aunt Fanny , " that I need worry about returning it . " " As a matter of fact , " Aunt Fanny said , " I believe I also need a book . " The lending library was tucked into one corner of the gift shop run by the Misses Inverness , and relied for trade rather heavily upon the transient souvenir-hunter rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Carriage Stop Inn next door . Miss Inverness kept the library and Miss Deborah Inverness sold gifts ; some inner integrity had preservedtheir shop from being a shoppe , but when the Misses Inverness had first decided to go into trade Miss Inverness had taken some of the stigma away from the shop by hiring Mr. Ossian , the carpenter , to put Elizabethan half-timbering across the front , and to set in an inglenook around the fireplace . The gifts were almost without exception made of china , delicately colored , and involving numberless small deer and kittens and scottie dogs . Miss Deborah did the dusting herself , naturally , and her sister kept the books . Miss Inverness wore purple crepe with her mother 's garnet brooch , and tended to be brusque , although she knew  --  none better  --  that her heart was really of gold ; Miss Deborah wore a little locket around her faded neck and had once been in love with a music teacher . There had been a little tiff between them three summers agop87over ashtrays , since the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late Mr. Inverness had been accustomed to take his cigar in the lobby of the Carriage Stop Inn . Miss Deborah had insisted with unusual spirit that even proper ladies  --  Mrs. Halloran up at the big house , for one  --  used ashtraysnowadays and had as much as accused her sister of not keeping up with the times . Miss Inverness had capitulated , askingher sister irritably how long Mrs. Halloran at the big house had been setting the standards for the Inverness family ? and the gift shop now stocked tiny porcelain shell ashtrays . Miss Inverness read a chapter from Henry James aloud every evening , and they drank their tea from fragile , gold-rimmed cups which had been a legacy to their mother from the first , mortal , Mrs. Halloran . When Aunt Fanny opened the door a little bell rang musically , and Miss Inverness rose from her seat in the inglenook ; Miss Deborah , cornered among the china , could only smile most cordially . " Caroline , " Aunt Fanny said ; she and Miss Inverness had played together as children . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Miss Inverness , " Deborah , Miss Halloranis here . And Miss Ogilvie , " she said . " How nice . " " How nice , " said Miss Deborah , coming with caution between the tables . " Miss Halloran . Miss Ogilvie . How very nice . " " How nice , " Miss Ogilvie said to Miss Inverness , and to Miss Deborah , " How nice to see you again . " " How well you look , " Miss Inverness said . " And Mr. Halloran  --  is he well ? " " Not well at all , " Aunt Fanny said , and Miss Ogilvie nodded sadly . " I am sorry to say that he does not keep well , " Aunt Fanny said . " My nephew 's death ... "  | " Such a terrible blow , " Miss Inverness said , and Miss Deborahmurmured , " Tragic . " " It is a very sad thing to lose an only son , " Miss Ogilvie confirmed . " And dear little Fancy ? " Miss Inverness turned to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said . " Such a sweet child , " Miss Deborah said . " She was in here with her mother not long ago . Of course , it was before ... " her voice trailed off , and she moved a hand eloquently . " Naturally , " Miss Inverness said . " She took a great pleasure in our new little china dogs , made in Italy , you know . Such a careful child . She was really quite quite taken with them . " " You must see them , " Miss Deborah said . " Miss Halloran , you positively must see our new little dogs . The Italians do these things so colorfully , I always think . Dear little Fancy was positively enchanted . I think she was particularly taken with a dear little blue poodle , sister ? " " Such an engaging toy , " Miss Inverness said . " Dare I take Fancy a little something ? " Miss Ogilvie said to Aunt Fanny . " Do you think it might be . . . perhaps ... a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily comforted , " Miss Inverness said , and Miss Deborah said , " Poor child , some small pleasure might mean everything in the world to her right now . " " We 'll certainly take it to her , " Aunt Fanny said . " And we are interested , Miss Inverness , in books . " " Of course , " Miss Inverness said . " Something to read ? " " Light , please , " Miss Ogilvie said . " Some cheerful light reading . It 's only to pass the time . So difficult , just waiting , " she explained to Miss Deborah . Miss Inverness laughed roguishly . " I know better than to offer Miss Halloran most of the poor things they are publishing today . There are , however , some few really excellent books ,  |p89some  I can honestly recommend , I mean . Some I have read myself , and so has my sister . " " We had better take several , " Miss Ogilvie said . " We have no idea how long we will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inverness . " Then you would naturally need several . " " I want , " Aunt Fanny said , " at least one book on surviving in the wilds . " " I beg your pardon ? " said Miss Inverness , and Miss Deborah said , after a moment , " Surviving ? " " A book which would tell how to build a fire and how to catch animals for food . A certain amount of first aid , too , I expect . Such information as that . " " I can hardly begin to think  --  " Miss Inverness began . " A Boy Scout Handbook , " Miss Ogilvie said unexpectedly . " I used to have a brother , " she confided in Miss Deborah . Miss Inverness breathed again . " For Fancy , " she said . " Natu-rally . " " To comfort her , " Miss Deborah said . " And , " said Aunt Fanny , " I would like , if possible , a fairly elementary book on engineering , and chemicals , and perhaps the various uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now , " said Miss Inverness , " I know that we would not have an encyclopedia . Perhaps the library in the big house . . . " " It 's fairly old , " Aunt Fanny said . " No really new information . Physics , you know , and politics . I wonder if we have time to order a new one . " " But what would little Fancy want with an encyclopedia ? " Miss Deborah wondered . " Are you going to send her to school ? " " I was not brought up to be evasive , Miss Deborah , " Aunt Fanny said . " I have immediate need for a good deal of prac/tical information on primitive living . Survival . I have no way of knowing what we may be called upon to do for ourselves . " " Aunt Fanny , " Miss Ogilvie said , " Miss Inverness and Miss Deborah have always been so kind . . . so thoughtful . Would it not be an act of friendship to include them in our future ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Fanny said . " But I do not think it will offend Caroline or Deborah if I point out , frankly , that our need will be for more sturdy , more rugged personalities . Remember , our little group must include builders and workers as well as  --  " she blushed faintly  --  " the mothers of future generations . " " I am sure , " Miss Inverness said with some stiffness , " that neither my sister nor myself has any desire to be looked upon as a worker , and it is long since we gave up any notion of breeding children . I am astonished , Frances Halloran , to hear you talk so coarsely . I would not have expected it , not in front of my sister . " " I apologize , " said Aunt Fanny , who could afford to be mild . She turned to Miss Ogilvie . " You see , " she said , " it is not fair to them . We need a different kind of person altogether . " " If your needs are what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not altogether mollified , " I assure you that my sister and myself must refuse , most firmly , to be included in any way whatsoever . " " Caroline , dear , " Miss Deborah said gently . " I am sorry , " Miss Ogilvie said . " I should never have said anything at all . It was only because one so rarely meets congenialpersons , really congenial , and I thought it would be a shame to lose Miss Inverness and Miss Deborah as friends . I am sure they have always been most respectable , and it will be sad to think of them after they are gone . " " Our mother brought us up to be respectable , I hope , Miss Ogilvie . I will get your Boy Scout Handbook . "  |p91Still  contrite , Aunt Fanny selected half a dozen novels , the blue poodle for Fancy , and a shell ashtray for Essex . Miss Deborah made everything into a neat package ; which was left in the shop for Julia to gather in later when she came back with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Fanny , and gave Miss Ogilvie only a small bow ; Miss Deborah accompanied them to the door of the shop , troubled and civil , and opened the door for them , the faint musical tinkle of the door-bells for a moment overriding her voice before her sister called her sharply . On the sidewalk outside the shop Miss Ogilvie said , " Well , I 'm happy to think that we will probably never go in there again . I think Miss Inverness has gotten very crotchety . " " Like her mother , " Aunt Fanny said . " Candles , " she said , " candles . I forgot candles . " " Then I 'll just run in and have a cup of coffee , dear , " Miss Ogilvie said . " In the drug store , because they look at you so strangely in the Inn when you only order coffee . " " Do n't talk to anyone , " Aunt Fanny said . " Put out of your mind any ideas except that we have come into the village for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen minutes , and I beg of you to be silent about the future . " " Naturally , " Miss Ogilvie said placidly . " It 's so difficult for me to describe , anyway . " The drug store , like every other store in the village , sold an enormous variety of goods ; no storekeeper in the village found himself able to exist on the marketing of any single commodity ; the grocer sold light bulbs and paper supplies , the antique shop carried a sideline of homemade candies and jellies , the hardwarestore sold toys and newspapers , and the drug store sold them all , besides cigarettes , paperback books , and an unending series of chemicals at its soda fountain . Miss Ogilvie , easing herself gracelessly onto a high stool at the soda fountain , foundp92herself alone in the store except for the soda fountain clerk , a young man with poor hair and pimples , leaning listlessly against a sign showing a tempting chicken salad sandwich adorned with pickles and potato chips ; " You want something ? " the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily . " Peach pie , " she said , " with chocolate ice cream on top . " It was only half-past ten , and luncheon at the big house was not served until one . Miss Ogilviemade a series of small wriggling gestures in order to straighten out her skirt under her , and set her pocketbook on the counter next to her and cleared away an obtrusive ashtray and a container of paper napkins . When the young man set the peach pie with chocolate ice cream on top in front of her Miss Ogilvie smiled at it , and then , congratulatingly , at the young man . " One of the things I am going to miss , " she said confidentially , " is fancy food . " The young man let his eye rest briefly on the peach pie , and retired to lean once more against the chicken salad sandwich . " Do n't care much for pie , myself , " he said . " Cake 's more my line . " Miss Ogilvie snapped her fingers in sudden irritation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot ; I was so sure I was going to remember to tell Aunt Fanny to get lots and lots of those prepared cake mixes . They 're so much easier , and it 's hard to think how we 'd get any baking done , otherwise . " " Or cookies , " the young man said . " Lots of people like cookies . " " And blueberry muffins , " Miss Ogilvie said . " Dear heavens , I hope I remember to remind Aunt Fanny when I see her . " " Working in a place like this , " the young man said , " you 'd think I 'd be crazy about ice cream . Would n't you ? " " Well , that 's one thing we ca n't take , " Miss Ogilvie said.  | " It would melt , " she explained . " Since I suppose the electricity will all go off , and then the refrigerator wo n't stay cold . " " The electricity do n't go off , " the young man said . " This time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any trouble . My brother 's on the lines , he 'd tell me . " " But of course , " Miss Ogilvie said , wide-eyed , " that night the buildings will be gone . The places they send the electricity from , I mean . And of course the wires . " " What night ? " the young man asked idly . " I 'm not supposed to talk about it , but I guess it 's all right to tell you , so you can tell your brother that it wo n't be any use . " Miss Ogilvie swallowed a piece of peach pie . " Aunt Fanny told us all about it . It 's coming very soon . Fire and floods and sidewalks melting away and the earth running with boiling lava and all the poor people trying to get away . " She sighed , and looked down at her pie with sympathy . " All over the world , " she said , " everywhere . And in the morning there will be nothing left . I suppose it 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be simply nothing ; we will look out of the windows  --  that 's all of us , in the big house , not you , I am afraid , and I am really terribly sorry . But we will all look out the windows and in all the world there will be nothing but drying earth , with the grass beginning to grow . All the houses and people and automobiles and everything will be just melted away . " She sighed again . " I just do n't know how we 're going to make our coffee that first morning , " she said . " I suppose we will have to build a little fire somehow . Kindling , " she said . " I will tell Aunt Fanny to get kindling . " " You want to be careful , starting fires , " the young man said . " It 's pretty dry this time of year . " Miss Ogilvie stared . " You do n't understand , " she said . " There wo n't be anything left to burn . "  |p94The  young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked at last , " that the day of Armageddon is coming ? Like that ? " " I think so , " Miss Ogilvie said uncertainly . " Like where it says in the Bible the day of Last Judgment ? The final trump ? " " I think that 's different , " Miss Ogilvie said . " I mean , the rest of you  --  " " My ma , she talks like that . She 's got this club , the True Believers , they call theirselves . They all talk like that . Got peoplecoming over from the city to meet with them , they talk like that too . " " You mean there are others ? " Miss Ogilvie said , barely breathing . " The True Believers is what they call theirselves . I listen sometimes , me and my brother , the one I was telling you about ; he 's on the lines . He says to me , ' Do n't you believe it , bud , I see enough electricity to know it 's scientifically impossible . Scientifically impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got nothing else to do . But do n't you get taken in , because them scientificfellows have proved that the world did n't start the way they say , and it ai n't going to end the way they say either . Protons and neutrons  --  that 's the answer . Electric force . ' " " These True Believers , " Miss Ogilvie asked anxiously , " how many of them are there ? " " Ten , maybe . They meet and get messages from the spirit world . Ma 's got a control named Liliokawani , used to be a Egyptian queen . Tells her things . " He laughed richly . " Liliokawani , " he said . " Boy , did they use to live it up , those Egyptianqueens . " Miss Ogilvie pushed her peach pie away suddenly . " Ten more , " she said . " I better go right away and find Aunt Fanny and tell her . I 'm not sure she 's going to be pleased . We thought , " she explained , " that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We really get along quite well together , so congenial and all , and so refined and everything , and now strangers . . . " She slid hastily off the stool . . " I 'll tell Ma you was asking , " the young man said . " That 'll be a quarter for the pie and fifteen more for the ice cream . " " My father , " said Aunt Fanny , " was beyond all things a democratic man . He believed in encouraging the villagers in every possible manner , although I do not recall that he ever mingled among them socially . I can not picture him visiting this young man 's mother . She may easily have been deceived . " " The young man himself was quite positive about it , " Miss Ogilvie said miserably . " But really  --  ten extra people , and we had counted so on being alone . " " I do not see that we need bother about it further , " Aunt Fanny said . " I am quite positive that my father would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was looking across the street toward the spot where the bus stopped , bringing Harriet Stuart 's visitors , or an occasional traveller interested in dining at the Carriage Stop Inn , or an elderly person come to count the number of people still alive in the village . Mr. Devers , the postman , had gotten off the bus today , because as everyone in the village knew he had gone yesterday to the city to see his only son off for the army , and now Mr. Devers was standing on the corner with his suitcase talking to a stranger . Aunt Fanny was looking at the stranger . Yes , the stranger agreed over tea and sandwiches at the CarriageStop Inn , yes , he was a stranger . His tone implied that in faraway villages all over the world he was well-known , and a stranger in this village only . He hinted at himself striding recognized down exotic streets , walking in sandals through dust , moving slowly behind an oxcart or a rickshaw or a dog/sled , kicking aside the encumbrance of a cashmere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , sheltering his head from the snow , regarding unmoved typhoon and flood , seeing with familiarity such scenes as the quiet eye could not envisage , laughing and looking easily and speaking intimately in strange tongues ; yes , he agreed , he was a stranger . It was not possible even for Aunt Fanny to ask where he was from , but Aunt Fanny asked where he was going , as if she had not known when she saw him standing by the bus . He was genuinely surprised when Aunt Fanny asked him to visit the big house , as though the invitation should not have come quite so soon , as though he had been caught unaware with his persuasions and insidious compliments unexpectedly useless ; " Do n't you even want to know my name ? " he asked blankly . " I suppose I shall have to introduce you to my brother , " Aunt Fanny said . " Although I do n't believe any name you might give would be important . " He looked from Aunt Fanny to Miss Ogilvie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " I expect they would be forged , " Aunt Fanny said agreeably . " My mother once hired a butler who gave forged references , because he had been a convict . " " I see , " said the stranger . " My father suspected something in the way he walked . Naturally , when I invite you to my house as a guest I would hardly ask for references . " " I had n't thought of it that way , " said the stranger . Miss Ogilvie , blushing , said to Aunt Fanny , " He seems to me to have something of a military bearing . " She spoke as though the stranger , being so very strange indeed , could not hear her . " Captain Scarabombardon , " said Aunt Fanny unexpectedly.  | " At your service , " said the stranger , who was clearly extremelybewildered . " In any case , " Miss Ogilvie said , " we will all stand as one when the time comes . Cleansed . Pure . " " I do not recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Ogilvie . You are a very fortunate man , Captain Scarabombardon . " She picked up her gloves . " Julia should be coming with the car , " she said . " Come along , Cap-tain . " " Well , " said Julia , when the stranger handed Aunt Fanny into the car , " and who might you be ? " " He is the captain , " Miss Ogilvie explained eagerly . " He is coming home with us , Aunt Fanny invited him . " " Captain ? " said Julia , who was not at all that bright , " captainof what ? " " I wish I knew , " said the captain . " Captain Scarabombardon ? " said Essex , " am I to be an Harlequinnow ? I had dreamed of something more heroic . Did I ever tell you , " he asked Mrs. Halloran , " of my trip to the moon ? " " Captain , " Mrs. Halloran said , " will you have wine ? " The True Believers did not delay ; perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate Mrs. Halloran received , at the breakfast table the next morning , a letter written on violet paper with brown ink . The letter was heavily scented with carnation , and Mrs. Halloran read it aloud , holding it at arm 's length . Dear Fellows in Trust and Faith : It is with the utmost joy that we here in our humble Society of True Believers , being as far as we knew until now the only selectp98group to be chosen to carry the torch of mankind salute you . If we had known there was any other group like ours we could of gotten together sooner , but it is not yet too late . If you are of genuine faith and truly deserve the higher levels and will repent and sincerely follow the path of true teaching and never turn aside . Our leader will give herself the pleasure of calling upon you very soon and she will of course be able to tell right off whether you are on a spiritual level high enough to join our humble little band . In all life there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be prepared . ( Mrs. ) Hazel Ossman , Secretary . Mrs. Halloran folded the letter and put it carefully back into its envelope . " I assume , " she said at last , " that someone will offer me a rational explanation of this . I am most reluctant to believe that I am going mad . " " It 's that boy in the drug store , " Miss Ogilvie said helpfully , anxious that Mrs. Halloran should not believe that she was goingmad . " We were talking , yesterday , while Aunt Fanny was shopping . " " Aunt Fanny went shopping ? I had not heard . " " I believe that I may go into the village , Orianna , without troubling to ask your permission . I have been accustomed to the village since I was a child , and I can not remember ever having to ask permission to go there . " " How did you get there , Aunt Fanny ? Did you walk ? " " Certainly not . Julia took a car from the garages . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said defiantly , " No one told me not to . " " Besides , " Aunt Fanny added maliciously , " how did you think the captain got here ? We brought him back with us . " " I had done you the courtesy of assuming , Aunt Fanny , that the captain was another of your ghostly manifestations . " " Now wait a minute , " the captain said . " I understood I was welcome here , and if I 'm not I certainly know what to do aboutp99it , " but he made no move to rise from the breakfast table . " Captain , " said Mrs. Halloran , " Aunt Fanny is kind enough to allow me to entertain my friends here ; I can hardly refuse her the same civility . Julia , if you ever again touch anything belonging to me I shall send you away from this house . I leave it to your mother to point out to you what you would then forfeit . Aunt Fanny , you are surely right : you have never had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am sure that the villagers are used to you by now . " " My father took a great interest in the village . I have always tried to carry on his plans . " " Some of your father 's activities in the village , Aunt Fanny , were luckily discontinued with his death . But I see no reason why you should be kept away from your subjects ; next time please ask me for a car and I will send a reliable driver with you . Miss Ogilvie , I will expect you to receive these people with me , since you clearly know them better than I. " " I do n't know them at all , " Miss Ogilvie cried , " they are certainly not friends of mine . " " They may very well become friends of yours , however , and . perhaps even closer than that ; perhaps fellow survivors . We must not be overselect , Miss Ogilvie . " " Aunt Fanny , " cried Miss Ogilvie pathetically , but she was abandoned ; Aunt Fanny was speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady of indeterminate shape , but vigorous presence , perhaps fortified by the silent support of Liliokawani , queen in Egypt . She swept into Mrs. Halloran 's ballroom with the air of one testing the floor for durability ; she was wearing a purple dress which presumably fit her , and a fur boa of color and fluff . Behind her came a second , also purple , lady , whose hair was red , and , behind her , a man whose determined majesty was most convincing ; he hadp100magnificent hair , which suffered a little by comparison with the leader 's fluffy fur , and he wore , perhaps out of deference , a white waistcoat . At the very last came a withered little lady , peering . " I am Edna , " said the leader . " Our committee . Hazel , who is also our secretary . Arthur . Ah . . . Mrs. Peterson . " " Mrs. Peterson , " said Mrs. Halloran majestically . She had been wise in her choice of the ballroom ; beneath the sweeping carved ceiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people looked toylike ; not so much out of place as decorative . " We have come , " said Edna , not faltering , " to inquire into your present position with regard to supernatural visitations . Prophecies . The end of the world , in fact . Someone told us , down in the village , and being as we 're in much the same line . . . " She spread her hands eloquently . " Dreadful are the hopes of man , " said Mrs. Peterson drearily . " Naturally , " Edna continued , " we thought we might like to get together with you folks , if your ideas go along with ours . We do n't take converts , as a rule , but naturally if you folks got to believing by yourselves I guess we got no choice . Anyway , " she finished , " we got to get a place to meet . " " Everlasting darkness is the end of mortal life , " Mrs. Petersonadded . " I 'm the seer in our group , " Edna said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether sure , " said Mrs. Halloran at last , " that we have a seer . What we do have , of course , is a place to meet . In that respect we are more fortunate . " " Eternal damnation attends us , " Essex said helpfully . " Well , who gets your messages ? " Edna asked . " Her ? " She gestured toward Miss Ogilvie , who gave a little gasp and took a step backward.  | " Miss Ogilvie does not receive messages , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Miss Ogilvie is our . . . contact with the outside world . " Miss Ogilvie wrung her hands and looked ready to cry . " When ? " Edna demanded . " When ? " Mrs. Halloran was puzzled . " My sword shall destroy life , " said Essex . " Horrible is the future ahead , " said Mrs. Peterson . " When is your date ? Your outside limit ? " " We have not been so far honored . . . " Mrs. Halloran began . " Jeepers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it ? " she asked her committee , and the woman with red hair and the man in the white waistcoat nodded and looked mournful . " You , sir , " the man said , addressing Essex . " Do you atone ? " " Daily , " said Essex . " Sin ? " " When I can , " said Essex manfully . " Metal ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " How do you stand on metal ? Allow yourselves metal fastenings ? Meat ? Ills of the flesh ? " " I am heir to all of them , " said Essex , inspired . The man in the white waistcoat looked puzzled and turned to whisper into the ear of Edna . " The time is near at hand , and vengeance is swift , " said Mrs. Peterson . Edna nodded vigorously at the man in the white waistcoat and came forward to speak earnestly to Mrs. Halloran . " Look , " she said , " we 're a whole lot further along than you folks , but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on condition you try to catch up some , and of course we could meet here only out on your lawn , maybe , because we largely do n't believe in roofs over our heads . Now I may as well tell you right off that we gotp102all our messages already , so we just happen to know that th , l spacemen are coming " Spacemen ? " said Mrs. Halloran faintly . " Spacemen , from Saturn . Why ? Do you  --  " " Not at all , " said Mrs. Halloran . " Well , we get it they 're due along about the end of August , because the skies are clearest then . Early September , maybe , if it takes longer than they figure now to get here . And the saucers could land right out there on your lawn , see ? It would be a good clear place . We 're all going to be right there , ready and waiting , with no metal fastenings and what not , and we figure we go to Saturn where we get translated into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you more about that as we go along . Anyway , you got to start now practicing , get rid of all metal , and no meat and of course no alcoholic beverages and none of them fancy wines you probably got around here . Mrs. Peterson here is our cook . " " All hope is hopeless , " Mrs. Peterson pointed out , " all strivingvain . " " The main thing , " Edna said , " the most important main thing , is we got to be ready when they come . There 's no second trip , remember . You miss the first saucer  --  you never get a secondchance . Once that saucer with your name on it leaves , it 's gone . And remember they wo n't take you if you 're wearing metal or been indulging in fancy wines . They know . " " What do they drink on Saturn ? " Mrs. Halloran asked with interest . " Ambrosia , " said Edna unhesitatingly . " We got it in a message , because Arthur here was asking that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meetings with you folks , and after a couple times you 'll get used to our ways , and then you 'll come out on the lawn with us , and  --  "  | " Where have you been meeting until now ? " Mrs. Halloran asked . Edna sighed . " Right now we 've been meeting over to Mrs. Peterson 's , except her husband 's kind of nasty about it and Mrs. Peterson figures we better start going some place else , particularly to eat . " " I am sorry , " Mrs. Halloran said  --  she was frequently gentle when she perceived that sharpness would be wasted  --  " I am sorry , but I am afraid that we will not be able to qualify for your space ship . I myself can not do without my fancy wines , and I believe that my associates  --  except possibly Miss Ogilvie  --  use entirely metal fastenings . Miss Ogilvie ? " " Zippers , " Miss Ogilvie whispered , pale . " Nothing but zippers . Everywhere . " " So you see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own destinies , in addition to which I can not possibly hope to persuade my little group to leave this planet for another . Perhaps  --  after you have gone , of course  --  we may hope to inherit this one . Perhaps we may even come to like it . " " Well , you certainly do n't expect  --  " Edna began , but was silenced when Mrs. Halloran held up one hand , regally . " We wish you a pleasant journey , " Mrs. Halloran said . " We hope that you will be very happy on Saturn , in . . . a higher order of being ? Perhaps you will keep us under observation ? " " This earth has no temptations for us , " Edna said stiffly , and Mrs. Peterson droned behind her , " A world well lost , and dire be its fate . " " Thank you , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Mrs. Peterson , good day . " " Woe , woe , " Mrs. Peterson said , and they filed out , Edna leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway of the ballroom . Mrs. Halloran gesturedto Miss Ogilvie to follow and see them safely down thep104stairs , and Miss Ogilvie went quickly , half-backing out and half skittering . " You know , " Mrs. Halloran said , leaning back in her chair , " I could kill Aunt Fanny . " " Man 's life is but a moment run , " Essex said . " Essex , stop it at once . You would make quite a good impression on Saturn , I should think . " Essex made a face . " Ambrosia is not my drink . " " Something must be done , however . I will not have space ships landing on my lawn . Those people are perfectly capable of sending their saucers just anywhere , with no respect for private property . I want all the gates in the wall checked , today . You and the captain had better go . Go right around the wall , all the way . Make sure that no one can get in anywhere  --  there may be spots where it has weakened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that they are kept locked . You may put on new locks , if it seems necessary to you . No one is to go in or out without my permission , and I mean particularly Miss Ogil-vie . " " Aunt Fanny ? " Essex asked softly . " Yes . " Mrs. Halloran sighed . " What a plague Aunt Fanny is getting to be . I will not forbid her to visit the village , providedthat she only passes through the gates with my permission . I will tell her that it is for her own protection , and trust that she will believe me . Her captain is , after all , a potential asset , and there is surely room enough inside the wall for all of us . " " This is all very well , " Essex said , " but I do not see how it will keep out flying saucers .

' If any spaceships land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogilvie . I am really very angry , Essex ; Miss Ogilvie , with her wanton chattering , has very nearly sent us all to Saturn . " " Not so long as you indulge in fancy wines , " Essex pointed out . " Furthermore , " Mrs. Halloran said , " if any True Believer attempts to enter this house again , Essex , I want you and the captain prepared to inflict the most direct bodily retribution . The one true belief I want firmly implanted in the minds of the True Believers is the unshakable conviction that I am not one of their number . " " Much like Mr. Peterson , in fact . " " Not at all like Mr. Peterson ; I find his reaction piddling . " " Perhaps , " Essex said wickedly , " Aunt Fanny has been wrong all the time ; perhaps this house and everyone in it will go with the rest of the world . The True Believers would then have the last laugh , you perceive . Unless , " he added , " laughing also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was lost . She had planned to take her walk no farther than the beginning of the orchard , to admirethe blossoms on the apple trees , and had gone aimlessly and without hurry around the side of the house , through the sunken rose garden , and down the orchard path , but there she had somehow , dreaming , lost herself . She had either come out the wrong gate from the rose garden , or turned off on a cross path , because the orchard was not ahead of her at all ; it was not for several minutes that she realized that she had somehow gotten herself into the maze . Now , the maze was not at all frightening to Aunt Fanny , who had grown up knowing its secrets . Like all mazes , it went to a pattern , and the pattern had been , romantically , built around the name of Aunt Fanny 's mother , Anna . One turned right , left , left , right , and then left , right , right , left , and so on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whet+ Aunt Fanny had been a child it had been a dear puzzle to her , and she had spent hours trying to lose herself in the maze , but she could never forget her mother 's name . Again and again , coming unerringly to the center of the maze , where there was a stone bench and a marble figure tantalizingly named Anna  --  although of course Aunt Fanny 's mother would never have permittedherself to be portrayed from life in that state of undress ;  |p107not  , at the very least , without a petticoat  --  Aunt Fanny had thrown herself down in tears . Was she to be disappointed , always , because she could not forget the answer ? Was she never to lose herself , as other people did so easily , could she never escape into the mad labyrinths and run confused ? And yet now , not a child any more , and long forgetting the maze , Aunt Fanny was at last lost . She stood with her back against a hedge , looking right and left at a divided path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long , and it has not been kept up as it should . She was not frightened at first , because she had never yet succeeded in losing herself in the maze . The tall hedges grew up past sight on either side , although they should have been cut to just above her height , and they were not trimmed . The hedges had not been trimmed , before , along the walk to the secret garden , and Aunt Fanny sighed irritably ; it was because she was the only person who traveled these ways , and it must not be tolerated . Anna , she thought , Anna . She could at one time have almost drawn a picture of the maze , knowing so well its trickful turns and alleys , could have pictured faithfully the mysteries where she could not lose herself . There was one point where the path seemed to be going in a circle ; although it was the right path , there was one false turn where long ago she had found a bird 's nest . The finish , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you were turned in the wrong direction . She had long ago made a little castle of her own in one dead end path . Now , so much later , she leaned her head back against the solid hedge and said Anna , and turned right . When I get to the center , she thought , I will check to see if the statue of Anna is as I remember ; perhaps it has been neglected , or defaced . When I get out I shall tell Orianna Halloran that the hedges are a disgrace , even in the maze where no one ever comes any more . She turned left ; I do not believe , she thought ,  |p108wondering  , that many of the others even know that there is a maze at all  --  there is so much that everyone has forgotten , or never been told in time . The hedges were so overgrown that the turns were indistinct , and once , where she was sure of a turn right , the branches crossed in front of her and kept her out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , and then right again . Still not frightened , she stopped for a minute to remember with amusement a long forgotten fury : this , she remembered suddenly , was a turn which had particularly angered her long ago , because she knew so clearly , always , that it led to a dead end , and had never been able to fool herself with it ; no matter how optimistically she had tried , telling herself that yes , this was surely the only right path , she could never make herself forget that she was leading herself down a wrong way . I never will forget it , either , I suppose , she thought , turning right , because it is part of my mind now , and has been for so long . I wish they had made it more difficult . Anna , Anna , Anna . She was caught in a pocket of hedge . For a minute she believed that the hedges were only so overgrown that they hid the alley , and then she was at last aware that she had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , she thought easily , wherever you are , Anna will bring you out . She turned back , moved right , hesitated , turned again , and was taken by the calculated bewilderments of the maze . Once , running , she stopped and sank back against the strength of the hedge and thought Minotaur , Minotaur ; somewhere , the strong branches holding her around , tight away from freedom , she cried out " Anna , Anna " and turned and twisted wildly in a frantic escape from the trap of branches holding her helpless . Once she saw the way out clearly , and even reached her hands almost through the hedge into daylight but could not get through . But this is my own maze , she told herself , this isp109the maze I grew up in ; I could not be a prisoner here ; I know the way so perfectly , and she turned and was further lost . It was much darker . Overhead the hedges seemed to meet , shading the alleys mortally ; ahead there was nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Fanny turned , right , right , left , and blundered against the taut grasping fingers of the twigs , felt her dress caught , and her hair , felt scratches on her cheeks under the sharply caressing touch ; Anna , she said , turning left , Anna , turning right . Look , she said aloud once  --  it was much later ; it was very dark , and no one knew where she was  --  look , here is where I buried a doll once , when I was so small , and I buried my doll on a wrong turning so no one would ever find her grave . Right here is where I buried my doll . I could always find my way out , from here ; I used to try to lose myself on this very path  --  this is where I used to come and hide when I was unhappy , and just beyond this turn is the spot where I cut my hand on a sharp branch and my brother bandaged it for me , because my mother was dead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come along this path pretending I was lost and could never go home again  --  no longer , she thought in despair ; these ways are wrong now . Then , before she would accept it , she was in the center of the maze . The hedges on either side separated and broadened , and her feet went from the gravel path onto lawn . There , in the gloom , was the marble bench , and , leaning over it pathetically , the statue named Anna , friendless now since no one ever came into the maze , leaning down with love to caress an empty place . Here was the center of the maze where no one could ever be lost who had a memory of her name . Aunt Fanny came unwillinglyto the bench and fell against it . There were dried leaves blowing against the marble , and the figure leaned down overhead , holding out bare arms of tenderness and love . Aunt Fanny put her face down among the dried leaves and thought ,  |p110well  I am here , I am at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret I am to learn from my many agonies ? Here I am , here I am , where is my reward ? What have I earned , learned , spurned ? Mother , mother , she thought , and felt the marble warm under her cheek . FRANCES . FRANCES HALLORAN . Aunt Fanny found her way out of the maze without fault ; she had no time to mistake the paths , running insanely ( Anna , Anna ) and if she was screaming there was no one to hear her or find her ; FRANCES HALLORAN FRANCES FRANCES HALLORAN and Aunt Fanny pushed through twigs and leaves ; FRANCES HALLORAN and she was out of the maze , onto the path to the rose garden FRANCES FRANCES FRANCES and there was Essex standing alone ; " Essex , " she called , " please help me , please  --  take me home " ; FRANCES HALLORAN , and it was not Essex at all . Aunt Fanny 's second revelation was duly recorded by Mrs. Willow on four pages torn from the pad by the telephone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carefully spoken , and Mrs. Willow was able to take them down almost exactly , although her hand shook as she wrote . " It is coming , " Mrs. Willow copied , " it is coming and my brother will be saved . There will be a night of horror , a night of terror and the father will watch over his children . The children must not be afraid . The children must wait . There will be screaming and imploring but the children may not go outside , the children must wait . It is coming , the father guards his children . Let the children wait . " " Why are you writing it down ? " Miss Ogilvie asked . " It 's almost the same as before . " " Shh , " Mrs. Willow said , writing . " My brother is not to be afraid . " Aunt Fanny , turning wildlyp111on the couch in the drawing room , tried to sit up , fell back , and threw her arms wildly . " My brother is not to be afraid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in his arms , he will shield us , he will cherish us and hide us , my brother is not to be afraid ; even if it is all gone my brother will be safe . There is nothing to be afraid of , nothing to be afraid of , we are safe and warm , we are safe and warm , everything is all right , everything is all right , do n't be afraid . I am right here , nothing can hurt you , nothing can get in . Brother , go back to sleep . Brother , " she cried , striking at the air , " I am here , I am coming , we are safe . " Then , very softly , " There will be a night of murder and a night of bloodshed but we will be saved . And now I lay me down to sleep , I pray the Lord my soul to keep " " Why are you taking this down ? " Miss Ogilvie asked . " Everyone knows it by heart . " Aunt Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked pressingly , " Tell us quickly , what must we do ? Are we all safe in this house ? Are we supposed to stay here ? When will it happen ? " " Brother , " Aunt Fanny said , and Mrs. Halloran said , " Essex , take care of her . " Essex leaned over Aunt Fanny and said gently , " Fanny ? Can you tell us what we should do ? " " Essex , " said Aunt Fanny , holding out her hand , and Essex , glancing over his shoulder at Mrs. Halloran , took Aunt Fanny 's hand and said , " Fanny , tell us what we must do . " " We are absolutely safe here , " Aunt Fanny said firmly . " We must cover the windows and doors lest the screams of the dying reach our ears and touch us with compassion ; or the sight of the horror send us running mad into its midst . Wrong is wrong and right is right and Father knows best . " And Aunt Fanny turned her head against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glancing again at Mrs. Halloran , andp112Mrs . Halloran said , " Just find out how long ; I like to know things well in advance . I detest being hurried . " " Aunt Fanny , " Essex was saying , " can you tell us when this is going to happen ? When ? How long do we have ? " " You ask too many questions , " Mrs. Willow objected . " Even I know that the medium can only answer one question at a time . For heaven 's sake , with you clamoring at her like that  --  " " When , Aunt Fanny ? " " After the snake , " said Aunt Fanny . " After the dance . After the snake . After the day the night . After the thief the flight . " " Poetry , " said Mrs. Willow disgustedly . She threw down her pencil . " When they start saying poetry they 're no good anymore , " she explained . " It takes their mind off it somehow . " " Miss Ogilvie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put her to bed . She is no longer of any use to Mrs. Willow . " She had hardly finished speaking when the glass of the great picture window , which filled one short wall of the drawing room , and looked out over the sundial , shattered soundlessly from top to bottom.  |p113A  PLACE of my own , Mrs. Halloran thought , turning restlesslyand dreaming in the great rosy bed with silk sheets , a place all my own , a house where I can live alone and put everything I love , a little small house of my own . The woods around are dark , but the fire inside is bright , and dances in moving colors over the painted walls , and the books and the one chair ; over the fireplace are the things I put there . I will sit in the one chair or I will lie on the soft rug by the fire , and no one will talk to me , and no one will hear me ; there will be only one of everything  --  one cup , one plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest I am living in my little house and no one can ever find me . " See , sister ? "  --  and Mrs. Halloran dreamed the voice . " I told you we would find some place here in the forest . " She turned and saw two children , a boy leading a girl , and the boy wore the face of Essex and the girl was Gloria . For a minute she hesitated , watching from her doorway to see if they were coming toward her and when she saw that they were she fled into her house and shut and locked the door . " I am so tired , " said the girl . " We can rest here if we want to , in this little house . " " Do you suppose anyone lives here ? " " If they do , they will be glad to give shelter to a lost girlp114and boy . In such a little house we wo n't find much , of course , but it will be good to stop and rest for a while . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell them we will sleep here tonight , and then tomorrow we can find our way home . " " Suppose they do n't want us ? " " Do n't be silly . We 're lost , are n't we ? And besides , we 're only children . " " Brother  --  the house ! It 's made of candy ! " " Are you sure ? " " Of course I 'm sure  --  come and taste it ; look , the roof is sugar , and the walls are gingerbread , and the flowers are all hard and sweet and the dust is sugar dust . And taste the windowframe  --  it 's flavored with cinnamon , and the chimney is chocolate ; you must climb up and get me a piece . " " And the tree here , " said the boy , nibbling , " the tree is mint . " Feeling the roof being eaten away over her head , Mrs. Halloranopened the door carefully and looked out . For a minute , not knowing what to say , she only watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , frightened , she shouted , " Stop it at once ! This is my house ! " " Do n't be silly , old woman , " said the boy , his mouth full , " it 's made of candy , is n't it ? " " I built this little house for myself and not for children to come and destroy ; both of you get away at once , do you hear ? This is my house where I live all alone . " " Sha n't , " said the girl and the boy paused in his eating to stare . " Old lady witch , " he said at last . " I am not . " " You are so , you are so . " The boy shouted with his mouth full and Mrs. Halloran saw with terror that half the roof of her safe little house was gone , and worse , not eaten but crumbled and thrown on the ground where the children hadp115pulled at it wildly . " You 're an old witch , " the boy chanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust , " You 're an ooooooold witch . " " This is my house , " Mrs. Halloran said , and the boy threw a piece of chocolate at her ; when it struck close to the doorway where she stood he shouted with laughter and came running over to pull away half the doorway with one great tug , and he fell to munching at it while he said , giggling , " Old witch , old witch . " Mrs. Halloran thought clearly in her dream : if I could get them to come inside , she thought , where I live all alone , I might shut them up somewhere until they promise to spare my house ; I might put them into cages until they promise to go away . " Will you come inside ? " she said softly , and then , thinking , " There is even more candy inside . " " Did you hear ? " said the boy to his sister , " She says there 's more candy inside , come on . " They pushed her rudely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , and she said , smiling but not turning , " Son , look into that little closet beside the door ; you 'll find licorice in there . " Then she almost laughed , and said , " Daughter , go into the kitchen and search the cupboards ; there is peppermint , and little cream cakes . " As the little house shook and strained with the eager burrowingof the children inside , she turned slowly and with pleasurefollowed them in ; she closed the closet door on the boy and slammed the cupboard shut on the girl , and then came outside again to sit on the grass before her door and enjoy the evening sunlight , hearing them call pitifully to her from inside . While she was sitting in the sunlight a woman , frantic , burst through the trees screaming , " My children  --  what have you done with my boy and my little gel ; where are my children ? " and when Mrs. Halloran looked up and laughed , the womanp116brushed her aside and hurried into the house , stopping as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof . In a minute she returned , guarding the boy with one arm and the girl with the other , and the boy was saying "  --  and she was going to cook us and eat us because she 's a witch , and she offered us pieces of her house and said there was licorice in the closet and there was n't because all she wanted to do was get us inside and then she locked us in and she said she was going to cook us and eat us and we could hear her building the fire under the oven to roast us for her dinner . " The little girl added , " And she 's a witch because she said there were cream cakes in the cupboard and she made me go inside and she was laughing all the time , " and the little girl snatched away a fragment of the window frame and stuffed it into her mouth . " And I never got any chocolate from the chimney , " she said , sulkily . " Witch , witch , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you worry  --  we 'll be back , with the others , and we 'll show you what we do to witches who eat children , do n't you worry . " Shouting , " Witch ! Witch ! " they hurried off through the forest , and Mrs. Halloran , turning miserably in her sleep , looked hopelessly at her little house where she had lived alone , with one cup and one plate and one spoon , her little house which was not made of candy at all . " There is something on the sundial , " Maryjane said . " I can see it from here . " " A bird , most likely . " Arabella , intending to walk slowly down the long lovely lawn , found herself turning toward the sundial in order to follow Maryjane . " I hate that thing , " Arabellasaid . " The sundial . " " It 's not a bird . It 's something . But what is it ? " as they came closer.  | " My God . " Arabella shuddered , and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I 'll touch it ; do n't be silly . It 's only one of the dolls from Fancy 's doll house . But how disgusting . " " Stuck full of pins , " said Arabella . " Disgusting . Someone 's taken one of Fancy 's dolls and put pins all through it . How can people treat a child like that , even around here ? " " It 's an old lady doll , ' said Arabella , peering . " Of course , it 's Fancy 's grandmother doll . The last I saw it was safely in the doll house , sitting at the little table . And now someone 's taken it and ruined it . " " Is it really spoiled ? " " I do n't care whether it 's spoiled or not , it 's just the idea of the thing . Fancy loves those dolls . " " Can you take the pins out ? " Maryjane pulled , tugging out one pin after another and dropping them into the grass . " Sometimes people make me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's hurt the doll . Those little dolls are only made out of wire and padding ; that 's how they can bend to sit down , you know , and look like they 're walking . " " It seems all right , " Maryjane said . " I 'll take it back and put it in the doll house again and maybe Fancy wo n't ever know it 's been gone . " " Or if she does notice you can just say you do n't know what happened to it . Because you do n't , after all . " On a very bright clear morning , the gates having been unlockedfor the occasion , the first of Aunt Fanny 's preparations arrived , the result of her shopping in the village and her orders sent to the city . Over the next few weeks , more of Aunt Fanny 's orders kept coming , from mail order houses and supply housesp118in farther cities , in answer to Aunt Fanny 's letters and telegrams . The first truck , arriving on that bright clear morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was almost immediately clear that there was not going to be room enough in the storage basements for the truck 's contents , let alone for Aunt Fanny 's further orders . In addition , there was some furtive conviction in Aunt Fanny 's mind that the contents of the various cartons , and the exceedingly odd assortments of material she had gathered , ought to be kept as much as possible away from the servants in the big house , perhaps to avoid gossip ; Mrs. Halloran , who was content to have the servants and villagers believe , as indeed they did , that Aunt Fanny 's fine aristocratic mind was slipping rapidly into imbecility , directed , with some amusement , that Aunt Fanny 's supplies be stored in the library , where the books lay against the walls , and the great tables and chairs in the center of the room could be pushed back to make space . A series of mystified deliverymen carried the boxes and packages , some inadequately wrapped , through the service entrance , down the long hall into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propped open by Essex with the bust of Seneca  --  and into the library , where everything was stored away . It was a scene not unlike the original provisioning of the library by the first Mr. Halloran , and the room of books , well dusted but not catalogued , looked down with an air of unbelieving surprise . Essex did not attempt to catalogue Aunt Fanny 's purchases , but Mrs. Halloran , looking in some surprise on a carton of cans of peaches , asked Aunt Fanny , " Surely we are entering a land of milk and honey ? Must we take our own lunch ? " " Sh , " said Aunt Fanny , as a deliveryman entered , carrying a case of canned spaghetti . " Those cartons will fit into the bookshelves , " she said , " lift some of the books out ; it will give usp119more space for the cartons . " The deliveryman set the carton down , unloaded half a shelf of books onto the floor , and put the carton into the bookshelf . He gave Aunt Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really think we 'll need to supply our own food , " Aunt Fanny said , with a trace of embarrassment . " It only seemed that perhaps , at first  --  while things are growing back , you know , and before we are quite used to the new ways  --  of course , there will be a period of adjustment . Put it in the bookshelf , " she directed . Mrs. Halloran regarded the little bundle of umbrellas the deliveryman was stuffing into the bookshelf . " For the sun , " Aunt Fanny explained eagerly . " We will have to build shelters eventually , of course . " " But surely . . . the house ... " " Sh , " said Aunt Fanny . " Put it on the bookshelf , please . " Before the first truckload was delivered completely , it was quite apparent that the library was not going to hold everything , even though many of the books now sat in untidy piles on the floor and the shelves were filling up . Essex , inspired by some obscure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the house where the orchard supplies were kept , and brought back half a dozen bushel baskets , and Aunt Fanny and Miss Ogilvie and Julia and Arabella tumbled the books into the bushel baskets . Aunt Fanny instructed the deliverymen returning to the truck to carry out bushel baskets of books and Mrs. Halloran , perhaps inspired by Essex , directed that the bushel baskets of books be carried to the barbecue pit and dumped there . While Essex industriously arranged cartons of canned milk and canned olives and canned soup on the shelves of the library , the captain and Mrs. Willow soaked the books with kerosene and watched them burn in the barbecue pit . As the first reluctant smoke rose and drifted past the library windows , Essex for a minute hesitated , moved a hand protestingly , andp120turned to Mrs. Halloran , who said , " They were none of them of any great value , Essex . Not a first edition among them , I should think , " and added , obscurely , " and not made of candy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at an end , " Essex said , and turned to set a carton of paper cups on the bookshelf . The work of unloading the truck and loading the library shelves , carrying out and burning the books , went on swiftly . It was only noon when the enormous van backed heavily away from the service door , and the library had an odd air of not having been changed in any very fundamental manner ; half the shelves were packed with cartons , but they were neat , and when Essex brought back the bust of Seneca he remarked , " A library is really a very good place to store things . I had never realized it before . " " There is room for a good deal more , " Aunt Fanny said , looking with anticipation at the two sides of the room still holdingbooks . " I think we shall do very nicely . Larger items , such as the bicycles , for instance , can go into the cellar . " " I am still not clear , " Mrs. Halloran said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly stated that a world of plenty  --  " " Even in a world of plenty , " Aunt Fanny said sharply , " you could hardly imagine that we would process our own olives , Orianna . Certain small luxuries ... " " What has happened to the old-fashioned silkworm ? " Mrs. Halloran asked , fingering a bolt of scarlet synthetic fabric . " Do you expect us to dress like madwomen , Fanny ? " " I hope , " said Aunt Fanny stiffly , " that even in a better world I shall still continue a lady . " " Aunt Fanny , " Essex said , " you understand that my belief in you is in no way failing ? "  | " Well ? " said Aunt Fanny ; she sat down in one of the great library armchairs and fanned herself lightly . " Aunt Fanny , " Essex said , " it is not possible that you might be wrong ? " " Wrong about what , Essex ? " Essex fumbled . " Wrong ... about your father ? " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of complete integrity . Tall , and with a good presence . Bred well , " and Aunt Fanny glanced , fleetingly , at Mrs. Halloran . " Aunt Fanny , " Essex said , " I am not doubting your father 's word . " " Hardly , Essex . " " But please do not laugh at me , because I am actually very much frightened . All these things you have brought here  --  " " Acting under my father 's instructions , I need hardly ex-plain . " " It seems so remote , " Essex said wildly . " Not remote , I assure you ; not remote at all . I should try to understand , if I were you , that when my father takes the trouble to come so far , the business must be very serious indeed . And I am persuaded that the end may come sooner than we realize , although of course my father has engaged to let us know in enough time . " " And you believe him ? " " Believe my father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Essex said , " tell us about it again . What will it be like , afterwards ? " " Much as it is now , I expect . I foresee a period of adjustment ; it will take some time , for instance , for the earth to recommence its cycle of reproduction , and such things as trees may take a while to grow to the point where they produce fruit . And we will have to find food somewhere . I can only suppose that we will come out , that first morning , into a world wipedp122clean and bare , with no sign that it has ever harbored anything living except ourselves . It will be lovely , with the loveliness of all fresh beginnings , but I can not see how , those first few days , we can expect to live off the land . Soon it will be quite a Garden of Eden , of course . Although as I recall the Garden of Eden , it was not so well managed ; I mean , " said Aunt Fanny , blushing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of prohibitions . Not only just that one tree , for instance . " " But no prohibitions for us ? " Essex asked tensely . " None , I should think . We will of course learn a good deal more about it as time goes on . But not , I should think about things we may not do ; I would really believe that , humanity being for all practical purposes at an end , the kind of moral disapproval which has been so necessary up until now will be wholly unnecessary ; we , after all , will not need to learn to behaveourselves . " " You talk of our living among green meadows and flowers and trees , " Essex went on insistently ; " What  --  " and he held his breath "  --  what about this house ? It will be here , full of valuables in this world and that . " " I have been thinking about that , too , " said Aunt Fanny , and gave a kind of little laugh . " It has seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our children and for their children . Living in the fields and woods as they do , living under a kindly sun and a gentle moon , with all their wants supplied from nature , they will have no thought of houses , and a roof will become to them synonymous with an altar ; we may yet live to see our grandchildren worshipping in this house . " " I should hope so , " Mrs. Halloran said . " I am  --  instructed , as I said , by my father  --  arranging to accumulate in this house all those items of practical value we might otherwise leave behind . There are things which may be useful to the innocents of that other world , and they will findp123them here , in the shrine of their gods . Tools , for instance . Jewels , which may seem almost magical to them . The lovely lines of the stairway ; we must not let a sense of beauty vanish from the world . " " My silver service , " Mrs. Halloran said drily . " Possessions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father would like that . " " Not in my lifetime , " Mrs. Halloran said . " They are legally willed to me . " " I think , " Gloria said unexpectedly from a dark corner of the room , and her tone silenced them , " I think they will come , those far-off people , moving fearfully into this house and not daring to touch anything , looking at the furniture and walls and floors the way we look at cave paintings or catacombs or ancient palaces ; I think they will come on a kind of pilgrimage . They will come in little groups , walking on carefully designated paths so that they will not touch anything or brush against the walls or jar any furniture , and they will walk very softly the way peopledo when they are walking in the footsteps of many many dead people and are afraid of wakening them or angering them ; I think they will not understand much of what they find in this house , but they will tell stories about it , and about us . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place for them . " " I forbid all this , " Mrs. Halloran said loudly and suddenly . " I will not leave this house in my lifetime . The rest of you may live in trees with my blessing . " " Your blessing will count for so little , " Aunt Fanny murmured , " afterward. "  |p124HAD  , as I hinted before , ' " the nurse read , going slowly in her flat voice , " ' a parcel of money , as well gold as silver , about thirty-six pounds sterling ; alas ! there the nasty , sorry , useless stuff lay ; I had no manner of business for it , and I often thought with myself , that I would have given a handful of it for a gross of tobacco-pipes , or for a hand-mill to grind my corn ; nay , I would have given it all for six-penny worth of turnip and carrot seed out of England , or for a handful of pease and beans , and a bottle of ink .

The sundial stood out more whitely against the deep green of the lawn ; there were apricots on the breakfast table . Aunt Fanny , in her mother 's diamonds , listened always , and late one night Mrs. Willow , aroused by what she thought was someone after the silver , found Aunt Fanny at the head of the great stairway in her nightgown , rapt and still and smiling ; " The time is drawing closer , " she said , when Mrs. Willow roused her . Although Gloria was most unwilling , Mrs. Willow was not a patient woman , and disliked the vagueness of Aunt Fanny 's appointments ; she insisted that Gloria look into the mirror again . " You 're used to it , " Mrs. Willow explained , " you knowp125it by now . We do n't want to keep starting new people at it . Besides , no one but you will do it . " Reluctantly , Gloria sat again before the mirror where the oil ran and shivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope I see something pleasanter this time , that 's all , " she said . " If I see any more of those terrible things you can just get someone else to look , and I do n't care whether they get mixed up or not on the other side . " " I wonder what nonsense we would be engaged in , if we were not doing this , " Mrs. Halloran remarked . " We are the gods , " Essex said , " sitting on the front porch of Olympus , regarding the doings of men . It is probably just as well that we have some nonsense to occupy us ; think of the harm we could do if we were bored . " " Well , do n't all keep watching me , " Gloria said . " You make me nervous . " Mrs. Willow and Aunt Fanny moved back a little , eyeing one another . " We 'll just wait , " Mrs. Willow said comfortably . " You let us know when you see something . " " I hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stirred uneasily in her chair . " It 's like being seasick  --  everything kind of churns around , and you think you ca n't last another minute , because you 're sinking into this horrid moving whirling twirlingcurling  --  I see a country . It 's clear . I see a country , a nice country . " " What country , dear ? " Mrs. Willow was making notes , in a notebook she had bought for the purpose and into which she had copied all of her previous records of Aunt Fanny 's statements . " Just a countryside . Trees , and grass , and flowers Blue sky . Nice birds . " " People ? "  | " No people . No houses . No fences or roads or television aerials or wires or billboards . No people . There 's a hill , with trees on it , and . . . it 's like a meadow . Soft . " She hesitated . " There are n't any . . . separations in it , that 's what I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green countryside going off in all directions . Perhaps that 's a river over there . " " Presumably every prospect pleases , " Essex said . " Wait . . . I can see someone coming , over the hill ; Essex , it looks like you , only you are n't dressed . . . you have n't got any . . . " Gloria turned scarlet and put her hands against her cheeks , but she did not sit back . " Go ahead , dear , " Mrs. Willow said . " We 're not squeam-ish . " " You might try to get me into a lion skin or a pair of bathing trunks , " Essex said . " I probably do n't know there are peeping toms around . " " You are . . . could you be hunting ? " " Hunting for what , in God 's name ? " said Mrs. Halloran . " Almost certainly for a pair of bathing trunks , " Essex said . " Could n't I please stand behind a bush ? " " Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite serious . " " It 's so lovely , " Gloria said . Essex opened his mouth to speak , but Mrs. Willow gestured violently at him and he was quiet . " It 's such a beautiful country . Essex is gone ; there are just soft hills and trees and that blue blue sky . " " Thank God I am out of sight , " Essex said irrepressibly . " I was beginning to have that feeling of being stared at . " " Look , " Gloria said , " oh , look , " and she laughed . " It 's changing , " she said , " it 's like a little painting of a landscape , and it 's changing so I can see over the hill and through the trees and now there are people , very far away . " They 're . . . dancing , I think ; the sun is so bright . Yes , dancing . "  | " Dressed ? " asked Essex , who was enjoying himself enormously . " I ca n't tell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and so tiny , and the trees are so tall around them ; I really think they are dancing . And I can see the flowers and grass moving a little , as though there were just the smallest breeze , and now I see a . . . is it a deer ? And birds . And a rabbit . " " Our ark has landed , " Mrs. Halloran said to Essex . " Tell me , dear , " Mrs. Willow said , " if we ask you questions do you think you can see the answers ? " Gloria closed her eyes . " I 'll try , " she said , sitting back . " That was pretty . " " It really gives me quite an odd feeling , " Essex said . " I shall probably never hunt again . " " It seems to me , " Mrs. Willow said , " that Gloria really sees in the mirror what we want her to . Be quiet , Essex . What I mean is that before , when she saw all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confused . Now that we know pretty well what to expect , it seems to me that they are showing her more of what we want to see . Maybe I 'm not makingmyself clear . " She looked over at Miss Ogilvie , who nodded mutely . Mrs. Willow sighed . " Gloria , dear , " she said , " we do n't want you to dwell on destruction and fear . We like your pretty pictures much much better . Now I have a good idea here ; I 'm going to ask you to look into the mirror and try to see the people in this house , just one month from today . That would be the end of June . Now think about the people in this house , and look into the window and see a picture of what we will be doingone month from today . " She turned to the others . " Trying to find out how much time we have left , " she explained . " Go along , Gloria . " Gloria leaned forward , her elbows on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily into the mirror , and her long hair fell on either side of her face , almost touching the table . " Roses , " she said at last . " Roses on the table in the dining room . Pink . " " That would be the rambler , " Aunt Fanny said . " My mother 's favorite . They planted six bushes for her , and it 's true , they come into bloom about the last of June . " " All of us are there , " Gloria said , and giggled . " It 's funny , " she said , " I 'm there , too . It 's like a little picture , only the people are moving . We 're tiny . We 're having breakfast . Essex ... " " What am I wearing ? " Essex asked prudently . " A white shirt , I think . You 're telling a story , and we 're all laughing . I 'm wearing my blue and white cotton dress ; it must be very warm . " " Then I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of June , " Mrs. Willow said . " Gloria , think now . Try the end of July . Try to see all of us near the end of July . The end of July , Gloria . " " We 're playing tennis , " Gloria said almost at once . " We 're all at the tennis courts . Julia and the captain are playing against Arabella and me . " " I might have known , " Arabella said , with a cross look at her sister . " All the rest of you are sitting out on white chairs and benches and there is a green and orange and yellow umbrella and a little table ; you 're drinking ; it must be terribly hot because we 're wearing light dresses and shorts . I 'm wearing a pair of blue-striped shorts and it 's funny , because I do n't own such a thing . " " I 'll lend you mine , " Julia said helpfully . " We use that same umbrella by the tennis courts every summer , " Mrs. Halloran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p129or  its colors ? It is packed away in the carriage house , and has been since long before she came here . " " I can see it , " Gloria said . " The important thing is that what she sees shows us that nothing has happened yet , " Mrs. Willow said . " Naturally there will not be tennis courts or colored umbrellas afterwards . " She leaned forward and put her hand again on Gloria 's head . " Look again , dear . Look and see what we are doing at the end of another month . What are we doing , in the mirror , around the last of August ? " Gloria frowned , leaning closer to the mirror . " It 's hard , " she said , " because it 's so dark . All the windows are closed . I do n't know who 's there , they 're all like shadows . The sun is gone . " " What are they doing ? " " I think . . . " Gloria said hesitatingly , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big hall chest . Maybe a big sofa or something like that . They 're going to push it against the door . The candles are lighted , but it 's still very dark . They 're in the big hall , I can see the tiles on the floor . They 're . . . " she shivered " . . . barricading themselves in , I think . It 's very dark . " " Can you see any faces ? " " I can see Fancy , I think . Maybe it only looks like Fancy because it 's smaller . . . no , it is Fancy , she just came near a lighted candle . She 's . . . laughing . " " Laughing ? While we barricade the doors ? " Essex spoke softly to Mrs. Halloran . " Edna 's True Believers said the end of August , you know . " " If that crackpot has the date right I will eat a Martian , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Try to move a little farther , Gloria , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night ; try to see the next morning . " " I ca n't , " Gloria said . " It 's going away . " She sat back andp130looked at the mirror , which showed the faulted reflections of the cupids on the ceiling . " It scares me , " she said . " Aunt Fanny proposes , Gloria disposes , " Mrs. Halloran said . She touched the sundial gently . " We will not count many more hours here , " she said . " It still does not surprise you to know how easily we all capitulated ? " Essex asked . " I am not wholly convinced yet , Essex . " " You let the library go . " Mrs. Halloran laughed . " Perhaps I am an instinctive book-burner . " " I think you had a reason for encouraging Aunt Fanny to burn the books . " " Surely , Essex , Aunt Fanny is not so young as she was ; I can hardly refuse her these small pleasures . In any case , opposition to Aunt Fanny is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner world I will come to grips with Aunt Fanny . " " The captain and Julia have been whispering together in corners , " Essex said . " Mrs. Willow is always watching them . " " We can not afford to lose the captain , " Mrs. Halloran said . " If Aunt Fanny is right , Essex , your own tasks would without the captain approach the superhuman . " " You forget , " Essex said . " I am to be the huntsman . " After a minute Mrs. Halloran said , " That did not please me . I am beginning to dislike that girl , Gloria . And I suspect her visions . " " You can easily assure yourself of her truthfulness , however ; I have a small scar on my left thigh . " " Does the old lady keep much cash around the house ? " The captain 's voice was soft , and Julia only nodded . They were sitting in the summer house , from which they could see into thep131secret garden behind and down the long lawn ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the sundial . " I do n't know how much longer I can stand it , " the captain said . " My mother keeps watching us , " Julia said . The captain laughed . " I do n't mind your mother , " he said . " She 's not as bad as the rest ; even the old party in the corner ... " " Miss Ogilvie . " " Miss Ogilvie . She 's not too bad . But the crazy one . . . Aunt Fanny , I mean . . . she was around knocking on my door last night when everyone was asleep ; ' Captain , ' she says , let me in , let me in , I 'm only forty-eight years old . ' God . " He shivered . " I was going to shove all the furniture in the room against the door and lean on it . " Julia laughed . " One of these nights you 'll forget to lock your door . " " Not me ; catch me taking a chance like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she sent me and Essex to make sure no one could climb over the wall . " " Worse than that , we 'd have to have some kind of a car . We ca n't walk all the way to the village and even if we get to the village there 's only two fool busses each day . They 'd catch us in half an hour . " " What makes you so sure they want to catch us ? " Julia grinned wickedly . " Not me , " she said . " It 's not me they want . They 'd let me go and gladly , even my mother . I am not the father of future generations . " " My God , " the captain said . " Can we try for it today ? " " We 're not in prison , " Julia said , " and I 'm not going to be treated as though we were . . . you know , trying to sneak out in a delivery truck or something like that . I wonder if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Not me , " said the captain . " I personally would n't be surprised if they had a dungeon in the cellar . " " Mother ? " " What is it , Belle ? " " Julia 's out in the summer house with the captain again . " " I know it . " " You know what I bet they 're doing ? " " Yes , I know what you bet they 're doing . But they 're not . It 's my guess they 're planning to run for it . " " You mean Julia 's going to leave this house ? With the cap-tain ? " " I think so . " " That 's not fair . There are only two men in the house , after all , and the other one is Essex . You ca n't let him leave . " " I do n't know how I could stop them . " " Well , it 's not fair . You 've always liked her better than me . " " Aunt Fanny , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each other 's faces . " Aunt Fanny smiled obscurely . Miss Ogilvie peered through the curtains of the little sitting room where she and Aunt Fanny spent their mornings sewing . " Sitting close together , " Miss Ogilvie said . " I hope they will not be too disappointed , " Aunt Fanny murmured . " Well , they certainly do n't look like they might be disappointed . I think Mrs. Halloran ought to put a stop to it . It 's not healthy for Fancy , having things like that going on right in public . " " I believe their paths will not always run side by side , " Aunt Fanny said . " For the present , perhaps , but the briefest consider/ation of the future , Miss Ogilvie , should point out to you their differing roles . " " Well , of course I know what the captain is for , " said Miss Ogilvie , and blushed . " That is , " she explained , " I never really thought about it particularly , not for myself , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Miss Ogilvie , in this finer world of ours you do not suppose that we , you and I , will work with our hands ? Surely you appreciatethe need for a . . . what shall I call it ? . . . a servant class ? Who , after all , are to be the hewers of wood and the fetchers of water ? " " How nice , " said Miss Ogilvie , and blushed again . " My instructions from my father , " said Aunt Fanny mysteriously , " have been far more detailed than many of you realize . " " Fancy , bring Mama her chocolates , will you ? " " I ca n't , I 'm busy . " " Do you want your poor sick Mama to have to get up and get them herself ? " " I 'll do it in a minute . " " You 're a sweet baby , Fancy . Maybe in a little while you 'll run and ask the captain to come and read to me . " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking and talking . " " I 'm sure he wo n't mind leaving her to comfort me a little when I 'm not well . " " I 'll ask him . But I bet he does n't come . " " You better tell your granny about how the captain and Julia are always hanging together . " " ' It happened one day about noon , ' " the nurse read flatly , " ' going towards my boat , I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man 's naked foot on the shore , which was very plainp134to be seen in the sand . I stood like one thunderstruck , or as if I had seen an apparition . I listened , I looked round me ; I could hear nothing , nor see anything ; I went up to a rising ground to look farther . I went up the shore , and down the shore , but it was all one , I could see no other impression but that one . ' "  | " My dear Julia , " said Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are being kept here as a prisoner ? " " I just want to leave , is all , " Julia said sullenly . " The captain and I . . . we want to get the hell out of here . " " By all means . " Mrs. Halloran shook her head . " I could hardly condemn you to stay . My own opinions would not , certainly , encourage me to leave , but I have no reason to suspect that you take your opinions from mine . That is , I feel that you are miserably mistaken , but since you do not share my belief , any attempt on my part to prevent you from leaving would be ridiculous , and , I suspect , wholly wasted . " " I just want to get out of here , " Julia said . With the cap-tain . " " Yes . With the captain . Since you have taken on the burden of announcing your joint intentions I conclude that the captain does not possess quite the dashing military bravado Aunt Fanny found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . you may leave , and your captain may leave , any time you choose . I am only disturbedthat there should have been any question in your mind ... beyond , of course , the great final question which occupies the rest of us so entirely . " Julia stared . " You 're not going to try to stop us ? " " Am I an ogre ? Is this castle of mine guarded ? Patrolled byp136dragons or leopards ? Do we live under a spell , as in the City of Brass , or an evil enchantment , as madmen flung down upon their faces when they step outside their gates ; can you believe that ... " " I 'll tell the captain , " Julia said . " And , Mrs. Halloran .. . thanks . " " Not at all , child . Remember that you will require your mother 's consent as well as mine . " " She wo n't care if I go or stay . " " Transportation to the city may be a difficulty for you . I regretthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive you there , but I know of a fellow from the village who may be available . I will arrange it , of course . I suppose you are anxious to be on your way as quickly as possible ? " " We certainly are . " " Then I will not trouble you to wait until tomorrow . The car will be waiting at the main gates , at nine this evening . " " That will be fine , " Julia said , her eyes shining . " We can be in the city tonight . " " Considering the short , the painfully short , amount of time left you to enjoy the pleasures of the world , I can not criticize your haste . " " Look , " Julia said , " one reason I 'm leaving , and the captain too . . . we do n't believe that crap , any of it . " " I said earlier that I did not ask you to believe anything . I am only wishing you godspeed , into the world and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you 've been nicer about it than I expected . I will say that for you . I never thought we 'd be able to talk you into it . Anyway , thanks . " " If you will now send the captain to me , I should like to say goodbye to him . I see the question on your face , Julia , and I will answer it : yes , I do intend to give him money , because I feel indebted to you both . . . not choosing to share our newp137world , you have been thoughtful enough to withdraw from it without attempting to jeopardize the chances of the rest of us . Now run along and pack all your prettiest clothes ; it is already after seven , so I will have a dinner tray sent to your room , in order not to interrupt your preparations . " " Mrs. Halloran , " Julia said , hesitating in the doorway , " look ... thanks again . " " You are certainly welcome , child , for anything I may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Halloran . " Mrs. Halloran turned from her desk , smiling . " Captain , " she said , amused , " what are you so afraid of ? I have invited you to come here to say goodbye . " " We thought , Julia and I , that you were going to be sore at us . " Not at all . I explained to Julia that there was nothing in any of our plans which justified keeping people here against their wills . You do want to leave ? " " I sure do . " The captain sat , awkwardly , and stared at his feet . " I would n't go , you know  --  you 've been pretty nice to me , after all  --  if I really figured I was . . . well . . . leaving you in the lurch , as it was . I mean , in all this stuff about being the only people left in the world , and so on , what Julia thought was ... " he stopped , red . " I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you need men . " Mrs. Halloran laughed . " Any Utopian community has need of both sexes , surely , " she agreed . " And I believe the Shakers , who live together as brother and sister only , are dying out with all the rapidity one would expect ; a basic regard for reproductionof the species  --  and how could such a regard not be basic , I wonder ?  --  can not be excluded from any of our plans , even Aunt Fanny 's . That does not mean , Captain , that we must capture ourp138men , like a pack of lunatic priestesses feeding on their mates . I have every hope , in short , of replacing you amiably and very likely without even the use of force . " " Mrs. Halloran , " the captain said , looking up earnestly and speaking with great care , " you do believe this , do n't you ? That is , you do honestly and in your heart believe that everything is going to go and you people here in the house will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Halloran said gently , " I believe that you and Julia are going willfully out into a dying world and that you will have perhaps only a few weeks of life before you are ... persuaded . . . that my beliefs are correct . I am sickened to think of your state of mind when you learn , at last , that you were mistaken . " " I do n't get it . " The captain shook his head . " I do n't figure you 're crazy or anything , " he said reassuringly , " I do n't for a minute want you to think I 'm criticizing you . But I just do n't see how any person with any sense can go for that stuff . How can the world end ? There 's no sense to it . Besides , " he went on ruefully , " one thing I know  --  nothing like that happens in my lifetime . I mean , why should I figure I 'm so special , the world is going to end while I 'm around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Halloran said , " and certainly a number of amazing things have already happened during your lifetime , and not the least of them is that you should be alive at all . But this is a time-wasting debate . I know that you and Julia are eager to be off , and I feel poignantly that you have so little time that I am unwilling to diminish it by so much as an hour . I have arranged with Julia that a car from the village will be waiting by the main gate at nine tonight , and by eleven you should be in the city , drinking deeply , I hope , of its gaieties . " " Yes , " the captain said . " The sooner the better . "  |p139Mrs  . Halloran turned to her desk and her checkbook . " I will not stop to put this gracefully , " she said . " I have explained to Julia that I am eager to smooth your remaining path ; I suspect that you are both expensive people , and so I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check from the checkbook and handed it to the captain , who hesitated , tried to seem indifferent , and then looked at the check . " Listen , " the captain said , pale , " this is a damn nasty joke . " " Not at all , " Mrs. Halloran said . " I am not above spiteful gestures , surely , but at least this time my intentions are perfectlyaboveboard . I spoke to the president of the bank in the city not half an hour ago ; poor man , I took him away from a dinner party , and he will not enjoy dinner parties for long . The check will be freely honored . " " But  --  " said the captain . He waved the check helplessly . " You did make a mistake , " he said at last . " No mistake , " Mrs. Halloran said gently . " That is the maximumsum I am able to command on short notice . The president of the bank was easily as astonished as yourself , but he is accustomed to doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree with you , is enormous  --  will be honored upon your presentation of it . " " But why ? " " We are not going to need it , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Please try to understand , Captain  --  we are not going to need it any more . " The captain sat down abruptly . " You mean this ? " he demanded . " You are really going to sit there and nod at me and hand me more money than I ever dreamed of in all my life , just for nothing ? Why , I 've only been here three weeks  --  I could n't steal this much . " He waved his hands wildly . " This kind of money is something I never even heard of , they do n't make thatp140much , it is n't real , and you just sit there and give it to me  --  lady , maybe I was wrong about you not being crazy . " Mrs. Halloran laughed again . " Maybe you were , " she said . " My own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to spend it all . " " It 'll take some spending , I admit , " the captain said , looking at the check again . " Now look , I 'm not aiming to quarrel with someone who just handed me a lousy fortune , but I 'm not crazy , and I got to figure there 's some string attached . Something 's going to happen to me . " " Please believe that I am crazy , if you like , but not that I am dishonest . " " I ought to grab this thing and get up and run and not stop running till I get to that bank and I make sure it 's true . But I do n't like not understanding what goes on , and I like to make sure that young Harry  --  Harry 's my real name , " he explained . " Indeed ? I shall continue to call you Captain . " " Anyway , that young Harry does n't get left out in the cold . You really believe  --  now let me get this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can give me this money because it 's not going to be any more good to you ? Right now this check is worth exactly what it says but in a few weeks it 's not going to matter what money I have because I wo n't be there and the bank wo n't be there and the money wo n't be there and there wo n't be any place to spend it anyway ? " " Exactly as I would have put it , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Then take it back , " said the captain . He rose and set the check down softly on Mrs. Halloran 's desk . " I never took odds like that in my life , " the captain said . " I know a lot about you by now , and if you 're ready to put that kind of money on the line , I figure Harry goes along with you . I stay . " " Think carefully , Captain . We have so little time ; you may not have another opportunity of changing your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the captain said . " I know when I 'm beat . " " Then you had best get right down to dinner . I will see that Julia is notified , and will join you shortly at the table . " After dinner Mrs. Halloran hesitated at the table for a minute , after the others were gone , to speak to Mrs. Willow . " I imagine that Julia is well on her way , " Mrs. Halloran said . I ! " I just hope she is , " Mrs. Willow said viciously . " Damnselfish unnatural child . " ail " You will be more pleased with her , perhaps , " Mrs. Hal- " 11loran said , when I tell you that before she left she took the liberty of helping herself to the money on my dressing table . " " How much ? " said Mrs. Willow , and then : " I suppose you left it there accidentally ? " " Not at all . I hardly liked seeing Julia go off with no adequatefinancial resources . " " How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fl lik Atas , s.aoran sa.eeeun Norris . I could not put my hands onto more than about seventydollars . Seventy-four dollars , to be exact , and eighty-nine cents . She took the silver , naturally . " " Julia is not above carrying small change , " Mrs. Willow said . " We will miss her , " Mrs. Halloran said vaguely , and continued on into the drawing room , and her shawl , and her evening walk with Essex . Julia , her suitcase on the ground beside her , stood in the warm dark evening by the main gates of the house . There was only a single light over the gates , and it showed more than anything else the elaborate scrolled H which centered each half of the gates ; far away , beyond the long reaches of the drive , she could see an occasional dim flicker which must be the lightsp142from the house , and she smiled . She felt almost pity for her mother and sister , trapped in the monumental lunatic asylum , and a growing excitement at the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with money and laughter and noise . She was pleased at having slipped soundlessly into Mrs. Halloran'sroom , to take the money the careless old woman had left lying around , she was deeply amused at the thought of herself and the captain , wandering luxuriously  --  perhaps to the Orient , perhaps to Spain  --  while her mother and her sister waited cruelly in the big house for a magnificent destruction which never came about ; she was even glad that she had said thankyouto Mrs. Halloran , since some day she might choose to come back here , furred and jewelled , to smile pityingly upon her older sister , grown weak and silly waiting for a new world . When a car pulled up beside her she was startled for a minute , and then , looking more closely , annoyed . Mrs. Halloran had not been above a petty revenge : the car was old and shabby , and the driver looked like a ruffian . " You the party going to the city ? " he asked , leaning forward over the steering wheel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , yes . Did Mrs. Halloran send for you ? " " Right . Pick up a lady at the gates , nine o'clock . " " There 's a gentleman coming , too . " " Not now , there ai n't . " The driver laughed richly . " No gentlemancoming this trip , lessen you mean me . " " You are mistaken . I am waiting for a gentleman who i$ going to the city with me . " " Not the way I hear it . Mrs. Halloran , she says to me on the telephone , you go at nine o'clock tonight to the main gates , you get a lady there , take her to the city . She will be going quite alone , Mrs. Halloran she says , quite quite alone . " " I am sure that Mrs. Halloran could not have said anythingp143of the sort . We are going back to the house , right now , and make sure about this . And when Mrs. Halloran hears  --  " " ' We are going back to the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in a high false voice . And then , " How ? " " Why . . . " Julia turned ; the gates behind her were locked . One of the gardeners had met her at the gates , unlocked them for her , and seen her out , and she had supposed vaguely that the man was still around , prepared to unlock the gates again for the captain . When she called , however , and shook at the gates , there was silence , and no movement , beyond the faint reflection of the one light onto the scrolled H on either half of the gates . " Why n't you climb over ? " said the driver , and snickered . " I want you to take me directly into the village to a telephone . She ca n't treat me like this . " " Well , now , I guess I could n't rightly do that . Mrs. Halloran , she said take you to the city . " " But I say  --  " " Now , you know Mrs. Halloran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what you think happens to me if she says take you to the city and then I turn around and take you somewheres else ? Dearie , " he said , " it 's the city or nothing , see ? And it 's going to rain , and the way I see it , if you was really to ask my opinion , either you get in the car with me and we go along to the city like she said , or I go home and you stay right here until Mrs. Halloran makes up her mind you should go somewheres else . And if you stay here , " he went on , still in that disagreeable , almost triumphant voice , " and it 's going to rain , and you 're going to get wet , it 'll be a mighty long time before morningwhen someone comes along to open these here gates . So now why do n't you be a nice reasonable girl and come get in the car with me ? " Julia , who did not often cry , was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , and so fromp144Mrs . Halloran , that she was frightened , and bewildered , and lonely . " I 'll go to the city , " she said . " I can telephone Mrs. Halloran from the hotel , anyway , and when I do , " she said , putting her hand on the doorhandle of the car , " do not suppose that I am going to praise the way you have behaved . I intend to tell her everything you have said . " " What 'd I say ? " he demanded , whining . " All I said was I got to do what Mrs. Halloran tells me . Where 'd I get if I did n't do what Mrs. Halloran tells me ? Now you get in like a good girl and we let bygones be bygones . " There was only one place in the car for Julia to sit , and that was in front next to the driver . The back of the car , seatless , seemed to be filled with old bottles and pieces of chain , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crawl away from the main gates of the house . " Better tell you right off , " the driver said , " this is going to cost you twelve dollars . " He had clearly started to say " ten " and then changed his mind , and the sharp break in the word seemed to amuse him , as though he had no need for dissimulation . " Twelve , " he repeated enjoyably . " Do n't go into the city this time of night for nothing , you know . " " Mrs. Halloran will pay you . " The man sneaked a sideways look at her . " Mrs. Halloran , she said something funny about that . She said she had left money for you , and you would pick it up and be the one paying me . " " Oh . " The car picked up speed reluctantly , shaking itself as though ready to balk and throw its riders , but the big man held it down firmly and after a moment they went more evenly along the road . Julia intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattractive driver , but he spoke chattily , raising his big voice without effort over the clatter of the motor , " What you going to the city for ? " " Because I choose to , " Julia said childishly . She turned point/edly as though she were going to look out of the window , although there was no window on her side at all , and the wind came disagreeably in on to her face ; she could feel the first stinging raindrops . She turned her jacket collar up and hunched her shoulders around her ears , in a feeble defense against the rain on one side and the conversation on the other . " Going to take the money I get from you , " the big man said placidly  --  he smelled musty , Julia thought , and foul  --  " and buy me some chickens . Got a little place for them out back of my house . I live in the village , of course . " He waited for some comment from Julia , and then went on , " Going to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big house , sell ' em to old lady Halloran . " They were moving steadily upward , and Julia remembered the soft lines of hills visible from the windows of the big house ; not long agc , while she was in her room packing , she had seen the hills from her window and told herself joyfully that beyond them lay the city ; " Tonight I will be there myself , " she had thought , hugging herself ecstatically . Peering through the rain , Julia thought she could distinguish a cleft in the line of the hills and although she did not want to speak she finally asked , " Is that where we 're going ? Through that sort of pass ? " " That 's right , " said the driver . " City 's on the other side . Funny thing about that pass , " he continued affably , " always full of fog . Down here , rain or hot or sunshine , but up there it 's always fog . Something to do with the hills . " " Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then another seven , eight , miles to the city . They call it Fog Pass , " he added , as one explaining something uniquely reasonable . When Julia was silent again he went on . " Caught a rabbit up there once . It got so mixed up in the fog it did n't even see me coming . Stood right there on thep146road watching me like it did n't know what I was . Ran smack over it with the car . " Julia turned slightly and let the wind drive the rain against her face . " Funny thing about rabbits , " he said . " Most people think they 're lucky . That one was n't lucky , " and he laughed . He had clearly reached a subject very dear to his heart , because he went on contentedly , " Killed some kittens once , my old lady had a cat always having kittens and this time I told her I 'd get rid of the things for her . Cut off their heads with my pocket knife . " Julia , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone my mother , was silent . " Got rid of some puppies by pouring kerosene on there and lighting  --  " " Please do n't , " Julia said violently , and he laughed . " Did n't know you 'd be bothered , " he said . " Folks no things like that all the time . Why , I knew an old man once lived up in these hills about a mile and he used to catch rats and  --  " " Please , " Julia said . " I could tell you things I saw in the army , " he said . " Everybodyknows about them , pretty funny , too , sometimes . You just touchy or something ? " " I do n't like to hear about it , " Julia said . " Well , if you do n't have to watch , I would n't guess you 'd mind . " He seemed to be puzzled . " Why , " he said , " my old lady was right there when I cut up them kittens . She did n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass ? " " Mile or so . You 're anxious to get to the city , I guess ? " " I certainly am . " " What you going there for ? " " I have an appointment , " Julia said wantonly . " Who with ? "  | " A friend . " " That so ? What about that feller you thought was coming with you ? The one Mrs. Halloran told me not to take ? Where 's he come in ? " " Look , " Julia said , turning to look at him , " I 'm sick and tired of answering your questions and listening to your dirty talk . You just leave me alone . " " Did I touch you ? " he asked , indignant . " I 'll leave you alone all right , dearie , Mrs. Halloran she did n't say nothing to me about not leaving you alone , I would n't touch you with a ten foot pole . Or maybe , " he went on slyly , " you was asking ? BecauseI got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like the city . " He thought , grinning to himself . " Oh , it would n't cost you any more , " he assured her . " I might even buy you a beer or maybe two . " Turning her back to him coldly , Julia put her face into the rain from the window . " Once I get that twenty bucks from you  --  " he said . " You told me twelve , " said Julia , startled into speech . " Must of misunderstood me , " he said calmly . " Happen to know it 's a twenty dollar fare to the city . Might even be twenty-five before we get there , " he said , and laughed . " You want to stop for a little while ? " " No , " Julia said . He laughed again . " You 'd maybe rather walk ? " he asked . They turned a curve , still going uphill and came suddenly into fog ; it was not fog like any Julia had ever seen , but rather an impenetrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . She could smell its faint smoky atmosphere even over the odors of filth and decay coming from the man next to her , and he slowed the car down until it was barely moving . " Got to take it easy along here , " he said . " Hills on one side , downhill on the other . Go off the road that way , you run into a hill , go off the road that way , you 'll likely hit a treep148or something , and just end up in the river way down below . " " Are you sure you know the road ? " " Do it blindfold . " He chuckled . " Doing it blindfold , " he said . " Right here 's where I run over the rabbit . Fog lifted a minute and there he was . " He laughed again . " Did you say you 'd rather get out and walk ? " he asked . When Julia did not answer , he suddenly put his foot down and the car stopped . " Now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " now you give me the money or we do n't go no further . We maybe do n't go no further anyway , " and he touched her on the back with his great dirty hand . Julia caught her breath . " Do n't be silly , " she said sharply . " Do you think I 'm going to let you get away with anything ? " " Fierce , " he said approvingly . " Ever tell you what I done with a dog bit me once ? " " Mrs. Halloran  --  " Julia began . " What she do n't know wo n't hurt her . And anyway , you do n't matter to her . She wo n't care , do n't worry . " " When I tell Mrs. Halloran  --  " " Now who 's being silly ? " He reached across her and opened the car door on her side . " You do n't want to pay for your ride ? " he asked , " you do n't get no ride . And I 'll tell the old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , saw him grinning dimly in the fog , and , terror-stricken , slid out of the car on her side . When she turned back to look at him she thought that the look on his face was one of dismay that she had called his bluff , and , standing on the road , she said , " I 'll just walk along the road until some other car comes by . You 've just lost yourself some money , mister . " " You get back in the car , " he said . " Pay me my money and there wo n't be no trouble . " " Find someone else to steal from , " Julia said . " Go home andp149tell Mrs. Halloran you did n't get the money . Go home and tortureyour cats and dogs and leave decent people alone . " She slammed the car door and turned away from the car . For a minutes he thought he was going to get out of the car and follow her , but he leaned forward and said anxiously , " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's frightened , Julia thought . She smiled and said , " I will give you exactly one dollar to drive me to the city . " " Now you know you 're asking for trouble , " he said , and this time he opened the door of the car as though prepared to get out . Thoughts of the rabbit and the kittens were vivid in Julia 's mind , and she backed up and moved away from the car . Clingingto her pocketbook , stumbling a little , she ran , thinking as she did so that it was ludicrous for someone who had been not an hour ago in the big house to be so taken in , to be running in frantic terror down a lonely , foggy road . Behind her she heard him calling " Miss ? " and she stood still , afraid to make another sound . It came to her then with a pang of elementary fear that it was only necessary to step a few feet in any direction to disappearcompletely into the fog . She turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found that the road and the car had gone into the fog and that although she knew precisely in which direction she had moved , her faulty feet and blind eyes would not lead her back . She called carefully , " Mister ? " and then thought , the fog muffling her voice and coming into her mouth , that perhaps he might yet find her by her voice , come silently up behind her in the fog and never give her a chance to tell him that he might have all her money if he wanted . She stood perfectly still , listening , and then turned to see if he was behind her . When she saw nothing she began to move cautiously . Better to take a chance on another car coming by , she thought , sooner or later someone will comep150along . She tripped over a rock and hurt her ankle and the noise held her motionless until she was sure that he had not heard her , was not moving softly through the silent fog . A vague idea of her surroundings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the road and on it the car ; she was perhapsten feet to the side of the road  --  too close , perhaps , to the sharp drop down to the river , but only just far enough from the driver for safety . There should be about fifteen feet on the side of the road before the slope down to the river became really steep , and on the other side  --  she hoped suddenly and fervently that it was the other side  --  there was a fairly wide space before the sharp rise of the hills . Her shoes , which were destined for the soft levels of a dance floor in a nightclub in the city , twisted and turned and hurt her feet brutally over these unseen stones , and her silk skirt was fouled with burrs . Wait , she told herself with her teeth set , wait till I get somehow into the city and to a telephone ; my mother will let Mrs. Halloran know what we think of this kind of treatment ; what a rotten way to treat a guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bedraggled and tattered , telling of having been abandoned and robbed on the road ; wait , she said over and over again through her teeth , wait till I can get even with all of them . An abrupt sound startled her , the sound of wheels upon the road , and she turned toward it . The noise was bewilderingly loud for a minute , and then began to fade away . Although she had moved involuntarily away from the sound she realized in that minute that it had been much farther away than it should have been ; had come , in fact , from the left of her instead of the right  --  or should it have been on the right ? Was she then on the wrong side of the road and going perhaps steadily away from it ? She turned and started sharply left , and almost immediately felt the ground begin to slope away under her feet ;  |p151have  I turned around in the fog ? she wondered , and saw ahead of her a tree shape blurred in the fog . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left as we came  --  toward the river ? Moss grows on the north side of the trees , the drop down to the river is slow at first and then sharp , but , by the time she had thought , she had lost the tree and had no idea whether she was going toward it or not . A small feeling of genuine apprehension came slowly upon her . This was not , could not possibly be , a small unimportant delay in her getting to the city ; no matter how she stumbled and struggled along , she was lost ; it was very possible that she would not get to the city tonight at all , would not reach a telephone , would not sleep in a hotel ; she might even find herself , with embarrassment and relief , embracing the first of the search party to reach her ; it might be that she would be sought for generally , over the hills , with men calling to one another and listening for her voice in reply , led by the intrepid driver of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking her if she 'd ever do that again , telling their wives when they got home that yes , they 'd found the fool woman , scared to death and halfcrazy. . . if , indeed , it occurred to the driver to send anyone to look for her ? She shook her head violently to rid her mind of this cloudy nonsense , and caught her foot on a rock or a root and fell heavily . In the fog there was no one to see if there were tears in her eyes , and for a minute she lay on the ground saying " Oh , damn , damn damn " over and over again to herself , and almost aloud . No , she thought , it was really too much ; she had not deservedthis of anyone , it was too much . It occurred to her that she might just lie here without moving until someone found her and the thought brought her to her feet again hurriedly . For heaven 's sake , she informed herself , imagine lying on the ground with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoes and probably they 'd want to carry you back , and what would you look like then ? It seemed that she had probably sprained her ankle and it hurt just enough for her to lose some perspective on her position . I shall not be lost , she said grimly , perhaps again aloud , and stamped on , putting her weight down firmly on her hurting ankle . If I hear one dog bayingor one man shouting I will climb into a tree and hide , if I can find a tree , and she laughed wildly . The sound of her own laughter in the fog startled her and for a minute she stood still . What on earth ? she thought , and , is this possible ? for me ? In order to find out more clearly where she was she brought both hands to her face and first rubbed her eyes and then bit sharply on her fingers , without knowing why . Then she said , still aloud , " Now , my girl , now , Julia , my fine creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What would they say if they saw you now ? That bastard captain ? Or even Arabella ? They 're all laughing at me now , " she assured herself wisely , " Arabella 's got the captain , and they 're sitting in the light and laughing at me , but they ca n't , they ca n't . " Blaze a trail , she thought , pile rocks together in a signal of distress , write messages and set them afloat in bottles .. . " Now listen here , " she said . She was moving slowly , almost aimlessly ; her hand brushed against a large rock and she did not lose her balance , but leaned peacefully against the rock and looked out blindly into the solid fog . Now we 're getting somewhere , " she said to the rock , now we 're making some progress . Just got to be a little careful not to fall down the hillside into the river , that 's all . Only thing we need to worry about  --  otherwiseeverything is fine , fine , fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out of the car and turned right , she thought , or left , went uphill or down , and hurt my ankle and walked . " Close your eyes , my sweet baby , " she said aloud , " you can see better with your eyesp153closed , close your eyes and take my hand and I will show you the way home . " She closed her eyes and with one hand resting against the rock began to walk ; it was more than a rock , although she did not actually care , it was a wall , and she went awkwardly and clinging along beside it , following the line of the wall through weeds and rocks and falling through ditches . There now , she thought , as the ground under her feet seemed to be going a littleuphill , there now , all I needed to do was sit down and think it out . I do hope that man is frightened because he lost me ; see , I am thinking clearly because I can remember how I got here ; I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She hit her foot against another rock and stumbled , and twisted against a tree ; this is really too much , she thought , tears in her eyes , and stepped ahead and knew as she put her foot down that it was a mistake ; she was over the edge into the river because her foot went down and down and never found the ground and she fell and rolled wildly downhill ; this is really more than I can endure , she thought deliberately , and fell unendingly , wracked and bruised , lying against the great iron gates with the elaborate H worked into the scrollwork on either side . " Good morning , Julia , " said Mrs. Halloran at the breakfast table . " I heard that you had come back to us . I am only sorry that you had such miserable weather . We had a singularly clear , bright night . " " Go to hell , " Julia said distinctly through her cut mouth . " Julia , behave yourself , " Mrs. Willow said . " If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elderberry jelly , " I would have given that fellow a bad time . " " You 're really terribly bruised , " Arabella said . " After breakfastwill you tell me what he really did to you ? " " All of you go to hell , " Julia said.  | " Odd that the gardeners should have been out so early , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Of course , you were there quite a while , as it was . But I would not have expected the gardeners to find you so early . " She nodded to the captain . " Coffee , Captain ? When you go upstairs , " she continued to Julia , " be sure to put the money back on my dressing table , since you had no chance to spend it . Strange , is it not , how one can manage to cling to some unimportant trifle at a time of strain ? Julia kept her pocketbook as someone , running from a burning house , might carry out a worthless vase , or an old newspaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Julia said . " My dear , " Mrs. Halloran said , " if you continue uncooperativeI shall not let you go to the city again . "  |p155ON  the morning of Sunday , June thirtieth , Gloria , in the middle of her breakfast , suddenly stood up , spilling Miss Ogilvie'scoffee , and stood , her hands over her face . " It 's true , " she said faintly , " it 's all true . " " Gloria , you have upset Miss Ogilvie 's coffee , " Mrs. Halloransaid . " Look , " Gloria said . She took her hands down from her face and pointed . " The pink roses1 , " she said , " we 're having breakfast . " " The pink roses are from the rambler , " Aunt Fanny said . " It was my mother 's favorite , and there were six bushes planted for her in the rose garden . Not one of them , I am pleased to say , has died ; I have made a particular point of looking after them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " There are the pink roses on the breakfast table , and I 'm wearing my blue and white dress and a minute ago we were all laughing at something Essex said  --  do n't you see ? It 's all exactly the way I saw it , before , when I was looking into the mirror . " " Well , of course , " Mrs. Willow said comfortably , " it had to happen sometime , did n't it ? " Twice during the month of June large trucks had delivered further shipments for Aunt Fanny , which had been stored inp156the library . Only one wall of books still stood and because the ashes of books  --  unlike the ashes of cloth , flesh , or even tea leaves and coffee grounds  --  are not healthy for growing things the gardeners had twice emptied the barbecue pit and taken the ashes to the village dump , which was just beyond the cemetery . Most of the property now stored in the library was in cartons , items purchased by Aunt Fanny in quantity and neatly packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the carton of first-aid kits . There were cartons of plastic overshoesand rubbers , in assorted sizes , of instant coffee , of cleansingtissue and sunglasses . Suntan lotion , salted nuts in cans , paper napkins , soap , both bar and flaked , toilet paper ( four cartons ) . Two complete tool boxes , with a keg of nails , since the bags of nails which Robinson Crusoe brought from the ship had proved so comforting ; mindful of Robinson Crusoe , Aunt Fanny had added a grindstone , and , with some embarrassment , several shotguns and an assortment of hunting knives . At Miss Ogilvie 's suggestion the library stock also included a small portable cooking stove , with several cans of fuel , and an entire carton of folders of matches . Maryjane proposed the citronella for mosquitoes  --  there was a great roll of mosquito netting standing in a corner  --  and several remedies for bee stings , sunburn , and snake bite . Essex and Mrs. Halloran added as many cartons of cigarettes as Aunt Fanny would allow them room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a representative selection of wines , although she confessed that she was puzzled by her own gesture . Foreseeing the day when their cigarettes would run out , Essex bought a pamphlet on the growing of tobacco , and thoughtfully laid in a gross of corncob pipes . Arabella suggested needles , thread , pins , hair curlers , deodorants , perfumes , bath salts , and lipsticks . Mrs. Willow , naming herself as the only really practical person in the house ,  |p157insisted  upon blankets , a wheelbarrow , reels of nylon rope , axes , shovels , rakes , and a barometer . It was Gloria 's conceit to begin a file of daily newspapers , which she planned to continue until their last publication . The captain supervised the storage of eight bicycles in the cellar , but voted against the addition of a motor bike , since a motor bike would require gasoline and he felt that in anticipation of a general holocaust the storage of gasoline in the cellar would be unwise . Julia , who continued sullen , asked for and was granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartons of variously colored yarns . " So I will have something to do with my time , " she explained disagreeably . The only books to be included were Aunt Fanny 's Boy Scout Handbook , the encyclopedia , Fancy 's French grammar  --  so that Miss Ogilvie could keep Fancy from forgetting the little she had gained  --  and a World Almanac . No writing materials of any kind were included , and gradually these books came to be called " unburnables " in order to differentiate them from the rest of the books in the library , which were absolutely burnable . " In Tibet , " Essex remarked idly one morning , while moving over a carton of canned tunafish in order to make room for a carton of tennis balls , " in Tibet , arsenic is used in the preparation of paper pulp . In Tibet , the paper is highly poisonous , and lingering in a Tibetan library is consequently a matter of considerable danger . As a matter of fact , in Tibet curling up with a good book is frequently fatal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's handkerchiefs near the summer house . It had been tied around the neck of a dead garter snake , and the snake had been draped over a branch of a cypress tree . Miss Ogilvie , concerned , told the captain , who told Mrs. Halloran , who told him to dispose ofp158it , and the captain dug a hole at the farther end of the rose garden and buried the snake and the handkerchief . According to the notes carefully kept by Mrs. Willow , it was on July tenth that Gloria again looked into the mirror . She reportedthen that she saw fruit trees , heavy with fruit , small figures , at some distance , bathing along the edge of a stream , and a pack of horses running in a glorious wild freedom . When pressed , she saw that on August twenty-seventh the people in the big house were gathered in the dining room for dinner as usual . On August twenty-eighth they sat , talking , in the drawingroom . On August twenty-ninth they were dancing , she thought , on the lawn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . Pressed further , for August thirty-first , for September first , for September second , Gloria caught again one glimpse of the soft untouched green world she had seen before , asked to return to August thirtieth , she first saw only darkness and then fell back , screaming that her eyes were burned , and had to be put to bed with a damp cloth over her face and one of Maryjane 's sleeping pills . " Thus it seems , " Mrs. Willow wrote in her notes , " that August thirtieth is to be the day , the last this world will ever know . " And then  --  quite out of character , actually , and in a shaken hand , she added , " God help us all . " " But I insist that the house must be barricaded , " Aunt Fanny said , adding , with a kind of inspiration , " It is like a child hidingits head under a blanket . We have absolute faith in my father , of course , but even though his protection applies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see strong reasons for coveringthe windows and blocking the doors . " " As I see it , " the captain said , " it sounds like we 're hopingp159no one will notice us . With absolute faith in your father , of course , " he told Aunt Fanny . " I am not happy about barricading the house , " Mrs. Willow said slowly . " Seems to me it sounds like not believing in Aunt Fanny 's father , sort of . I mean , either he protects us or he does n't . " " He told us to barricade the house , " Aunt Fanny said , nettled . " I think of it as cooperating with him  --  showing him , as it were , that we are willing to go halfway to ensure our own survival , rather than wait passively for him to do it all . " " Well , a blanket over the window is really not much protection , " Mrs. Willow said bluntly . " Perhaps , " Essex said , " it was planned to give us something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human animal burrows instinctively in times of danger , " Mrs. Halloran said . " I find Aunt Fanny 's picture of the child under the blankets not an inept one . " " We would feel safer , I 'm sure , " Essex said . " Perhaps , " Gloria said softly , " the blankets over the windowsare just to keep us from looking out ? " " I am a rake , " Essex said . " I should have been born into a time when it was easier for a young man to borrow money . Or , of course , I should not have been born at all . " " Silly , " Gloria said . " The sun is shining , and the sky is blue , and here we are , sitting quite close together on a bench all alone , and of all the things in the world to talk about you choose yourself . " " We are more intelligent than Julia and the captain , " Essex said . " We could leave here . We could go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate once you could do so again  --  and walk , if need be , to the city . Or we could wait for the bus , sitting in the lobby of the Carriage Stop Inn . If we didp160not choose to stay in the city  --  and I do you the credit of assumingthat you would want to get farther away than that  --  we could go on , as far as we could manage , and then settle down temporarily in another hotel , or inn , or rooming house ; at any rate , some kind of a furnished room to live in . All the furnished rooms I have ever seen had wicker furniture , and a painting of the Bridge of Sighs on the wall . We would have to find money somehow . One of us , in short , would have to work . " " That 's not hard , " Gloria said . " I can work . " " I expect it would have to be you , anyway . I would sit in the furnished room and pretend I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evening after a long day ushering in the movie theatre  --  " "  --  selling jewelry in the five and ten  --  " "  --  I would expect to be asked at once how the writing went today . I ought to get some paper and a pencil , so I would look authentic . " " And how did the writing go today , dear ? " " Very poorly , my love . One ballade , three villanelles , a kind of triolet thing , and an outline for a learned article on Freud . Gloria , " Essex said , turning to look at her , " I have never loved anyone in my life until now . " " I know , " Gloria said . " I know perfectly . " " I want to mate with you in a brave new world , all clean and shining , and yet I want to be your husband in this world , and live along in the kind of grimy squalor married people live in . I want a furnished room and jobs and dirty diapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Admirably . " " You would have to cook poorly , to meet my ideal . I want the kind of dismal future only possible in this world . I could put up with your long hours at the five and ten  --  " "  --  ushering at the movie theatre  --  "  | " I could put up with your inferior cooking  --  " I am an excellent cook . " " And your poor housekeeping  --  " " I keep a lovely house . " " And your squalling children  --  " " They are lovely , clean children , and all in bed asleep . " "  --  but I would always be afraid . Or at least for as long as always lasted . " " Afraid of Aunt Fanny , you mean ? " " Afraid of Aunt Fanny . " Gloria was silent . " If Aunt Fanny is right , " Essex went on after a minute , " and I ask your pardon for profaning this bright summer morning with Aunt Fanny 's name ; if Aunt Fanny is right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms , find ourselves in a situation of strong comic possibilities . Imagine , if you can , Aunt Fanny 's new world . " " I have been trying to imagine it for quite a while , " Gloria said . " Fresh , untouched , green , lovely . Untrammeled , except by ourselves . A lifetime of warmth and beauty and fertility . The kind of life and world people have been dreaming about ever since they first began fouling this one . I can sometimes catch glimpses of what it will be like , and they are tantalizing  --  " " I have seen it , you forget , " Gloria said . " In the mirror . It is more beautiful than you can believe . " " I am afraid so . Aunt Fanny must not be wrong . That world must exist . " He sat forward , anxious , holding his hands tightly together and scowling with earnestness . " It must ; we can not be promised such a thing , like children , and see it withdrawn . Oh , Gloria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being there . " " I could , " Gloria said , " and I have seen it . " He sighed , and relaxed . " Put it , then , " he said , " that if Ip162have one I can not have the other . I want to live with you in a room furnished in wicker , with a picture of the Bridge of Sighs , and your bad cooking  --  " " Superlative cooking . " "  --  and your job at the five and ten  --  " "  --  the movie theatre  --  " "  --  and the children , and the struggles and the cheapness and all the things we can get for ourselves in this world ; I never dreamed of wanting these things . But I want the green and gold world more . " " You have n't tried either one . " Essex shivered . " I have tried one , " he said . " How do you suppose I have been captured by Aunt Fanny ? " " I would n't care , you see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for myself . I would be happy enough if the end of the world caught me sitting in our wicker chair looking at the Bridge of Sighs . Unless , of course , I should happen to be still at work at the five and ten . A miserable way to go . " " But then we would lose everything , " Essex said . He looked at her curiously . " You see , " he went on , as one explaining glibly something better left unexplained , " you see , in Aunt Fanny 's new world , we will at least be . . . alive . . . together . We could not possibly , of course , be . . . well , living in our own room with the wicker furniture ; we would not be ... " " Dying romantically , in one another 's arms ? " Essex shivered again . " I do n't want to die , " he said , and Gloria laughed . " But I do n't , " Essex said , and Gloria laughed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Essex said . " But I 'm afraid I do , " Gloria said . " None of you is serious about this , " Essex said , and then added , making his voice light , " Poor Gloria  --  had we but world enough . "  | " Essex , " she said , but he was standing . " I must go and find Aunt Fanny , " he said . " We are burning another ten shelves of books this afternoon . " Gloria sat on alone for a minute or so , thinking that the sun was warm and the sky blue , and wondering if the sky would be bluer if Aunt Fanny had never been born . The end of the world , Gloria thought concretely , the whole world , all of it , my father , our house , our friends , gone in one bad night , and here I am among strangers , and willing to dare it all for one more strange than the rest ; but I would n't , she thought , I am intoxicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex , with suitcases , endeavoring to climb over the gate secretly ; I could only do it when I wanted to get in . When I came here , she thought , when I came here I would have laughed at such ideas as these . When I left home and came here I would have thought that these people were lunatic , and the gates locked to keep them from getting out ; I wish I had a chance to say goodbye to my father . " He 's gone to tell my grandmother , " Fancy said suddenly from behind her . Gloria , startled , was annoyed . " You little sneak , " she said . " He 's gone to tell every word both of you said . She makes him . " Fancy came around the end of the bench and sat down where Essex had been . " Who told her he was here ? " It occurred to Gloria that with Fancy everyone found themselves saying things they would rather not have said ; perhaps it was because Fancy looked at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you tell ? " " The captain . She 's had him following you two around . Like she had Essex following the captain and Julia . " " Why ? "  | " So she can make Essex tell her what you were saying . She likes to hear things like that . " " She 's a terrible old woman . " Fancy laughed . " You sound like my mother . I like her . " " Spying on people . " She does n't spy , the rest of you spy , on each other , " Fancy said flatly . " Did you make it up , what you saw on the mirror ? " " No . " " I think you did . " " I did not . " " You did . " " How can anyone know what they are really seeing ? " " I know . Essex would n't run away , anyway , because he 's scared of my grandmother . " " She ca n't hurt him . He ca n't stand the thought that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Aunt Fanny , even . The captain 's been in danger of his life and reason a hundred times and more and he does n't talk about dying . Only Essex and Aunt Fanny . " " I think the captain tells lies . " " So does Essex . " " He does not . " " He does so . " Gloria laughed again and after a minute Fancy laughed with her . " I like everything , " Fancy said . " And if Aunt Fanny  --  " " I heard so much already about Aunt Fanny and her lousy dreams I think I 'm going to throw up , " Fancy said . " I wish she 'd only shut up for a while . It used to be bad enough , Aunt Fanny snuffling all the time , but now that people listen to her it 's awful . " " We ca n't afford not to listen . "  | " Well , I just do n't get it myself . " Fancy thought , and gesturedat the garden which lay before them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of you just plain like things ? Always worrying about the world ? Look . Aunt Fanny keeps saying that there is going to be a lovely world , all green and still and perfect and we are all going to live there and be peaceful and happy . That would be perfectly fine for me , except right here I live in a lovely world , all green and still and perfect , even though no one around here seems to be very peaceful or happy , but when I think about it this new world is going to have Aunt Fanny and my grandmother and you and Essex and the rest of these crazy people and my mother and what makes anyone think you 're going to be more happy or peaceful just because you 're the only ones left ? " " That 's because you 're not very grown up yet , " Gloria said , sedately . " When you get older you 'll understand . " " Will I ? " asked Fancy innocently . " Right now I 'm not allowed to play with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too good a family for me to play with the children in the village and so later on I wo n't be allowed to play with the children in the village because there wo n't be any village , and we 'll certainly be too good a family because we 'll be the only family . And what will there be left for me to understand when I grow up ? " " You make it all sound foolish . Fancy , tell me . What is going to happen ? Do you know ? " " Well , " Fancy said slowly , " you all want the whole world to be changed so you will be different . But I do n't suppose people get changed any by just a new world . And anyway that world is n't any more real than this one . " " It is , though . You forget that I saw it in the mirror . " " Maybe you 'll get onto the other side of that mirror in the new clean world . Maybe you 'll look through from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you wish some big thing would happen and wipe out that one and send you back here . Like I keep trying to tell you , it does n't matter which world you 're in . " " Essex  --  " " I 'm sick and tired of Essex . " Fancy tumbled off the bench and rolled like a puppy in the grass . " You want to come and play with my doll house ? "  |p167AT  four-thirty on the afternoon of July thirtieth , Julia and the captain defeated Gloria and Arabella at tennis , Gloria wearing blue-striped shorts borrowed from Julia , and Mrs. Halloran , Aunt Fanny , Miss Ogilvie , Mrs. Willow , and Essex watching from under the beach umbrella set up near the court . Maryjane , who thought the hot sun beneficial to her asthma , lay on a rug on the grass , and Fancy played at some random game , singing to herself and smiling . In the shaded porch outside his room , where Richard Halloranspent the late afternoons when the sun was cooling , the nurse read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in , though the joy of seeing a ship , and one which I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen , and consequentlyfriends , was such as I can not describe ; but yet I had some secret doubts hanging about me , I can not tell from whence they came , bidding me to be on my guard . ' " After dinner Mrs. Halloran walked with Essex , going toward the sundial with her arm against his , relishing his even strength and sympathetic deference ; " Tell me again , " she said , standing over the sundial . " What is this world ? ' " Essex said obediently , " Whatp168asketh man to have ? Now with his love , now in his colde grave , Allone , withouten any companye . ' " " I do not care for it , " Mrs. Halloran said , caressing the W in WORLD . " Orianna , " Essex said . " Do you think that we will be happy there ? " " No , " Mrs. Halloran said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Aunt Fanny specifically promised us happiness . " " Aunt Fanny will promise anything to get her own way . How would she know what happiness is , say , to me ? " " How could anyone know ? " asked Essex politely . " Least of all my dearest and closest friends . Well , " Mrs. Halloran said , " we have not long to wait , and I think I will begin to plan my personal future . " The fire in the drawing room was still lighted of an evening because Richard Halloran felt the chill of the drawing dark in his old bones . When Mrs. Halloran had come in with Essex and given him her shawl to put away , she went directly to stand by her husband 's wheel chair and face the room . Looking around at them , at Aunt Fanny and the captain , at Mrs. Willowand Julia and Arabella , at Miss Ogilvie and Essex and Maryjane , Mrs. Halloran said , " I want to speak to all of you . You will be astonished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , be still ; do not reassure me  --  I think I know what I may count on from any of you . I require only your willing presence . " " Certainly , " Aunt Fanny said softly , " what you require , we " Be still , Aunt Fanny . I want to speak to all of you . The books burning away in the barbecue pit have put me in mind of it ; it has come to me that we must  --  I say advisedly , we must  --  give a celebration for the village ; you may call it a farewellp169party , if you like , Aunt Fanny ; it will certainly be the last gesture they will ever see from the big house . " " A farewell party is a pretty idea , " said Miss Ogilvie . " It becomes Mrs. Halloran to have thought of it . " Mrs. Halloran lifted one hand and set it on the shoulder of her husband , who stirred . " It may be in order to choose some occasion for this party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly announce it as a farewell ; I thought of a golden weddinganniversary . " " Who for ? " Maryjane demanded , and Aunt Fanny echoed , " Not Richard 's ? " " The village , " Mrs. Halloran said , " will not care particularly how many years Richard and I have been married  --  beyond marvelling at my youthful appearance  --  and I am sure that my good friends will not quarrel with my desire to do honor , one last time , to the husband of my choice and . . . " she hesitated , " ... the joy of my life . In other words , I choose to hold a celebration , and I do not care how it may be justified ; the burning of the books in the barbecue pit has put me in mind of a public barbecue  --  " " A witch-burning ? " said Gloria , but no one heard her . " And it is my pleasure that the populace be invited for the afternoon and early evening of August twenty-ninth , for a barbecue , dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Mrs. Willow said , moving in heavily , " You 're two years older than I am , Orianna , and if you 've been married to that Richard of yours any more than twenty-eight years I 'll be hogtied and thrown in the fishpond . Willow never lasted till our tenth year , but I guess I know how long I would have been married by now , as if I cared . " Mrs. Halloran touched her husband 's shoulder caressingly , and said , " In any case , I have decided that August twenty-ninthp170will be the occasion of the celebration of our golden nuptials ; let me be sentimental , Augusta , before I have no time left . " " If Willow had lasted  --  " " You would be as eager as I to celebrate any anniversary of your union . " " Richard , " said Aunt Fanny darkly , " ought to celebrate in sackcloth and ashes . It was the blackest day of my life . " " No doubt , " said Mrs. Halloran , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general joy on the occasion . I thought that  --  since there is really no purpose in trying to preserve the grounds of the house from the people of the village , when they are to be so wholly revised on the night of August thirtieth  --  we might throw all the grounds open to our visitors ; let them wander in the secret garden and lose themselves in the maze ; let them fall into the pool and pick fruit from the orchard . So long as not one of them comes into the house . " " It would be most unfortunate if anyone should stray into the library , " Mrs. Willow agreed . " We will set up a barbecue around by the kitchen garden , although , as I say , we will burn charcoal in it this once . Cantain , I will ask you to take charge of the barbecue and supervi the cooking . Essex , you will arrange for a pavilion of some soy , , where other refreshments will be served . Julia , Arabella , Maryjane , I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , please ? Assorted colors , and I think in festoons . Miss Ogilvie , you will of course make the salad dressing , as always . Aunt Fanny and Mrs. Willow , you will oblige me by making a careful examination of the gardens and lawns , to determine what improvements or additions need be made by the gardeners ; this is , after all , the last formal entertainment ever to be held here , and I should like to think that everything was looking its best . "  | " When is this . . . farewell party . . . to take place ? " Mrs. Willow asked . " Since we have only until August thirtieth , as I say , I believe that August twenty-ninth would be the most proper day . We will invite the entire village  --  subject , of course , to certain unavoidableomissions  --  to come at five . They will dine upon barbecued beef , and whatever else we plan to offer , and should leave us , I imagine , by eleven in the evening , after having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to retire early , in anticipation of a busy day on August thirtieth , and very likely , I should think , a sleepless night . I have , by the way , promised the servants that they will have an unexpected holiday ; after the labor and confusion of the garden party , I have told them , they will have the next afternoon and evening off . In the late afternoon of August thirtieth , two of the cars will take the entire staff into the city , planning to return here the next morning . " " As I supposed , " said Miss Ogilvie , nodding . " I thought we should have to make our own breakfast that morning . " " Several more unimportant items , " Mrs. Halloran continued . " Essex can hint to the villagers that a country dance of some kind , celebrating our fifty years of happy marriage , would be supremely appropriate . " " By the villagers , " Essex said , " I assume you mean the twenty-odd assorted young ladies who attend Mrs. Otis 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the terrace . " " Suppose I leave that in your hands , Essex . I had also thought of some testimonial from the younger children  --  a pretty little girl , perhaps , tendering me an armful of flowers ? You will see that flowers are provided , Essex , and perhaps a short , badly-scanned poem in honor of the occasion . " " Bad scansion I will not descend to , " Essex said . " I will findp172some little girl to give you flowers , and see that her face is washed . " " We can ring the bells over the carriage house , " Richard Halloran said , inspired . " Richard , " Aunt Fanny said , " you know that you have not been married to Orianna for fifty years . " " I have been married to Orianna for a very long time , " Richard Halloran said to the fire . " I have no objection to your mingling with the villagers , any of you ; Miss Ogilvie , you may mingle freely with the villagers . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion ; it is going to be in shocking bad taste , but of course it is for my last public appearance . I think to sit on the terrace under a gold canopy . " " Disgraceful , " Aunt Fanny said . " I want my people to have their last remembrance of me  --  if they have time to give me a thought at all  --  as truly regal , Aunt Fanny ; I plan to wear a crown . " " Orianna , you old fool , " Mrs. Willow said . " A crown , " Mrs. Halloran said firmly . " In shocking bad taste , as I said , and probably no more than a small tiara , but it will be in my mind a crown . I have always fancied myself wearing cloth of gold , and bowing . " " Seems to me , " Arabella said suddenly , " you ought to be giving us pretty dresses , too . Not crowns if you do n't want to , but some kind of pretty dress . " " Oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think we should all go , that last day , newly clothed and fresh . " " Well , not gold for me , please . I 'm much better in blue , with my eyes . Julia wears the red tones . " " I do not . " Julia scowled at her sister . " She wants me to look hideous , " she said , " just because she thinks it makes her look prettier . I want green , if you do n't mind . "  | " I like a flowered chiffon , myself , " Mrs. Willow said . " Somethingbright ; my size , it does n't matter anyway . The gels should be in light colors , Orianna , a bevy of beauty around you , if I do say it myself . I can run into the city and if I ca n't find what I 've got in mind I can buy the material and we can put them together here . At least my gels and I are handy with our needles , for so many years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wore the patches , " Julia said spitefully . " Arabella never had any trouble in just making do with any old thing so long as it was brand new and cost twice what we could afford . " " You  --  " Arabella began , but Mrs. Willow interrupted smoothly , " No squabbling , girls ; at least this time we do n't have to worry about what it costs ; what about you , Miss Ogil-vie ? " " I always worry about what things cost , thank you , Mrs. Willow ; I formed an early habit  --  " " No , no , dear ; what will you wear to Orianna 's party ? " " Oh , dear . " Miss Ogilvie looked anxiously at Richard Halloran . " Pink ? " she suggested hopefully . " I should think a nice dove grey , " Maryjane said . " I 'd like pink , " Miss Ogilvie said . " If anyone cares , I shall wear black , " Aunt Fanny said . " To mark my sense of the occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of shopping , " Mrs. Willow said happily . " I 'll go into the city one day next weeks and that will give us plenty of time to take things back if we do n't like them . What about you , Orianna  --  shall I look for your golden gown for you ? " " I have already ordered my dress , thank you . And my crown . " " I ca n't help feeling , " Mrs. Willow said , " that you will look like something of a fool , you know . Wearing a crown . "  | " You have not perceived , then , Augusta , that I wear a crown on August twenty-ninth to emphasize my position after August thirtieth . " Mrs. Halloran smiled obscurely . " I shall probably never remove the crown , " she said , " until I hand it on to Fancy . "  |p175ON  the third floor of the big house , near the end of the right wing , was a great room which Mrs. Halloran had never visited , although she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top floor of the right wing , sharing it only with the little room which the first Mr. Halloran had wanted to make into an observatory from which he could watch the stars . Because the big house was so extremely big the great room on the third floor was rarely remembered , and visited only by Aunt Fanny ; in it were the worldly possessions of the first Mrs. Halloran  --  not the diamonds which Aunt Fanny wore , nor the satin sheets and tiny golden chairs from the bedroom where she died , but the solid , well-chosen , and real possessions which the first Mrs. Halloran had known she owned , and had meant when , dying , she whispered , " Take care of my things , " to her husband . When the first Mr. Halloran brought his wife and his two small children to live in the big house he had built for them , he brought them from a bleak and uncomfortable top-floor apartment in a two-family house , and he made the change for them without a very adequate preparation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the furnishings in the big house , and during the long days of her illness took great consolation from the knowledge that her real possessions were safely stored away in an attic room somewhere above her head.  |p176Aunt  Fanny , who loved the big house , had always known somehow that the core of it was in the big attic room . Over a period of years she had , quite by herself , reestablished the fourroomapartment where she had been born ; the attic room was easily large enough for the furniture to be set in order , and Aunt Fanny had been astonished at her own memories , which set furniture and even ornaments into a pattern almost agonizingin its growing familiarity . The great ugly living room suite , patterned in dark red and blue brocade , which had been a source of such enormous pride to the first Mrs. Halloran , Aunt Fanny had set up first , the heavy couch facing the two deep armchairs . This furniture had been built to endure , and endure it would . Between the couch and the armchairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Fanny had gone into carefully packed cartons , dislodging mothballs -- -were a dark blue imitationvelvet fringed tablecover , a small music box which had been a candy dish , and played the first phrases of " Barcarolle , " a model of the Statue of Liberty , since the first Mrs. Halloran had come to New York on her honeymoon , and a photograph album bound in blue imitation leather . Aunt Fanny had turned the pages of the photograph album , looking in some bewildermentat the yellowed snapshots of the first Mrs. Halloran as a girl , somehow ludicrously innocent , in middy blouse and spreadingtie ; as a bride , looking up at an unrecognizable tall man ; as a mother , holding a pig-faced creature which might have been either her son Richard or her daughter Frances ; in company with friends who had by now very likely forgotten even her name . In these pictures Aunt Fanny could not find her mother , who was dead , but only a girl in a book , whose story was tragicallyswift , from girl to wife to mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from the day she had her picture taken laughing and long-haired in the middy blouse , top177the day when , photographed for the last time before the high steps of the two-family house , she smiled uneasily into the camera , her face barely discernible under the odd hat . Aunt Fanny sometimes wondered , turning the pages of the photographalbum , how much her mother had ever realized of that life which went by so quickly ; had she known , standing for her picture in front of the house where she had lived with her husband , had she known that it was for the last time , that no furtherrecord of her would exist ? Had she known earlier , then , in the middy blouse , that she was going to die ? Equally , then , did the faces which looked out from the other pages of the album , the faces of small Franceses and Richards , hold also that sweet indefinable reassuring knowledge ? Did the Richard in wide collar and velvet trousers know that he was going to die ?  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny Frances who sat , toothless , on a blanket in the sun ? " Some day I will be with my mother , " Aunt Fanny would think , turning the pages , " I am with her in this book , no one can separate us here . Some day we will all be together again . " The last pages of the book were empty , because the album had been packed carefully away years ago with everything else in the small apartment and had been stored in the attic of the big house ; " Is my furniture all right ? " the first Mrs. Halloran had asked the maids , " are you taking good care of my furniture ? Are all my boxes of things in a safe place ? " Nothing from the attic room had ever been permitted out into the big house ; the four-room apartment was intact . The living room of the apartment also held a small bookcase , in which the first Mr. Halloran had kept the books he used in his mail order education ; Aunt Fanny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carton labelled , in her mother 's straight handwriting , " Michael 's books . " There was even among them a book on etiquette , with the passages on the uses of table silver under/lined by her father , who memorized laboriously and slowly , and never forgot what he had once learned . On top of the bookcase Aunt Fanny , with unerring , almost supernatural memory , had put the framed photographs of her grandparents . In those first proud years the Hallorans had bought themselves a victrola , paying for it month by month , and it had stood , polished and handsome , with an imitation mahogany finish , in one corner of their living room . Aunt Fanny had never played it in the big house , and had been too small to be trusted with it in the apartment ; the records were carefully preserved in a compartment at the bottom of the machines , which opened to receive them in grooved individual sections . Aunt Fanny recognized the indefinable smell of the phonograph , of oil and mothballs and furniture polish , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schumann-Heink , or Chaliapin , singing " The Song of the Flea . " The four rooms in the apartment , which Aunt Fanny had so carefully put back together , included the living room , the kitchen , the parental bedroom , and the bedroom which small Frances and Richard had shared . In the kitchen the stove was cold , the icebox warm , but Aunt Fanny scrubbed regularly the oilcloth on the kitchen table where she had sat for meals with her mother and father and brother  --  the high chair used by Richard and then Frances stood still in a corner , where Mrs. Halloran had kept it because she never threw anything away , and never let anything decay ; there were four chairs around the kitchen table and Aunt Fanny had washed her mother 's everydaydishes and put them into the shelves of the dish cabinet and washed her mother 's company china and put it into the shelves of the glass-fronted imitation mahogany breakfront which had been meant to go into the living room but had been crowded back into the kitchen . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they still stood steady , there was a second cabinet , painted blue like the first , and matching the oilcloth table cover , which had once held food , in cans and boxes ; it had a flour bin and a built-in sifter , and , below , a bin for potatoes and onions . Aunt Fanny had washed her mother 's silverware , which had been a wedding present , and put it into the drawers of the kitchen table , and in the cabinet where the food had been kept Aunt Fanny had unpacked and stored away the neat piles of dish towels , dish cloths , pot holders , and table napkins . The beds were set up in the bedrooms , and Aunt Fanny had made them  --  the big mahogany double bed in her parents ' bedroom had a neat , intricately crocheted spread which her mother had made when she was not much older than the girl in the middy blouse and long hair , and had stored in her cedar hope chest ; there was her father 's dresser , plain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , which had always seemed unlike her mother to Aunt Fanny , but of course it had come with the bedroom set and had to be used . Aunt Fanny had placed a picture of her father , stern and uncomfortable , on her mother 's dressing table , and a picture of her mother , cloudy-haired and idealized , on her father 's dresser . The upholstery of the little bench before the dressing table was rose brocade , and Aunt Fanny had found the carton which held the little pink pebbled-glass pin tray , and the matching powder jar , and her mother 's ivory-backed brush and comb and mirror , and had set these things , in correct order , on the dressing table . Her father 's twin silver hairbrushes were on the dresser . The two pink hooked rugs were on the floor on either side of the bed . In the cedar hope chest were spare sheets and blankets ; in the drawers of the dressing table and the dresser were the contentsof three cartons , one labelled " My clothes , " one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael 's work clothes . "  |p180In  the other bedroom  --  there had once been a door between the two bedrooms , left open in case a child cried in the night  --  were the small bed on which Richard had slept , and the crib in which Frances had slept until she was five ; the first Mrs. Halloranhad been planning and saving to re-furnish the children 's bedroom when her husband cancelled all her plans by deciding on the big house . Aunt Fanny could remember the wallpaper in here  --  it had had a design of dancing bears  --  and the rest of the room was intact . She and Richard could have moved back here if they would . The little pink dresser had belonged to Frances , and in it Aunt Fanny had put the contents of the carton labelled " Frances , baby clothes . " The little blue dresser had belonged to Richard , and it held " Richard , baby clothes , " and " Richard , clothes , " since Richard had been older when they left . There was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice in Wonderland , " with an odd sense of distortion , since she could only remember her mother 's voice reading it to her . There were two toyboxes , one labelled " RICHARD " and one " FRANCES , " and in them Aunt Fanny had put , dividing with scrupulous fairness , the contents of the cartons labelled " Richard , toys , " and " Frances , toys , " and " Children , blocks , chalk , etc . " Some day , Aunt Fanny thought foolishly , I must bring Richard up here and see if he wants to play . There were two cartons Aunt Fanny had not unpacked . One , labelled " Wedding presents " she had not unpacked because it had never been unpacked . Inside it were the silver tea service , the silver cake servers , the handsome clock , which her mother and father had received as wedding presents and put away safely , planning to take them out to use some day when they had a nicer apartment , with more space for cake servers and handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children to the big house the carton was put away inp181the attic room with the other furniture because Mr. Halloran had insisted arrogantly that the big house be complete down to every slightest detail before he brought his wife there . In the big house there was no need for any further cake servers ; the silver tea service was inferior to the graceful modern set Mr. Halloran put into the big house , and the handsome clock would only have looked vulgar on the mantel of Mrs. Halloran 's bedroom , where she wanted it , next to the dainty porcelain dock Mr. Halloran had put there . If Aunt Fanny had cared to , she might have lived entirely in the apartment inside the house , cooking her meals on her mother 's stove , sleeping in her parents ' bed , putting records onto the victrola . The second carton Aunt Fanny never unpacked she had set away in a corner of her parents ' bedroom . It was labelled " Souvenirs , " and Aunt Fanny , knowing that it held a curl  --  wrapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Richard 's , and the ill-colored , straggling cards they had given her mother on Mother 's Day and Christmas , and perhaps letters from Michael Halloran , was afraid of what further she might find , what autograph albums , valentines , dance programs that might have belonged to the strange girl with the long hair among the photographs . If Aunt Fanny had cared to , she might have dropped from sight altogether into this apartment in the big house , might have left the others behind and gone into the apartment and closed the door , and stayed . " Come along , " Aunt Fanny said to Fancy ; she had been looking for Fancy and had finally called her from the gardens to come upstairs ; Aunt Fanny met her on the great staircase and took her hand . " I want to show you something , " Aunt Fannyp182said . " Just so you will know how well Aunt Fanny loves you , I want to show you something no one has seen for many years . " " Where ? " said Fancy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stairway which led to the third floor , " Where , Aunt Fanny ? " " I 'll show you , " Aunt Fanny said mysteriously ; she had no idea of why she was suddenly so anxious to show Fancy the big room upstairs , but told herself vaguely that it was a kind of continuity , a way of establishing one strong direct line from the first Mrs. Halloran to Fancy ; " It 's my doll house , " Aunt Fanny said happily , and opened the door with a flourish , as though she were her mother welcoming a guest . " What is it ? " Fancy asked , peering from the doorway . " My mother 's house , " Aunt Fanny said . " Where your grandfatherand I were born . " " It 's funny , " Fancy said . " Funny ? " " Strange , " Fancy said hastily . " A big doll house , but no dolls . " " The dolls are here , " Aunt Fanny said . " I remember them . My mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue upholsteredchair . " Sit on the footstool , Fancy ; that other big chair was my father 's . I am the mother , wearing a yellow dress . You must be me , little Frances . We will pretend that little Richard is in the other room , studying his lessons . " " Can I touch anything ? " Fancy asked , turning uncomfortably on the footstool . " Little Frances is not allowed to touch things in this room . When Richard has finished his lessons you may go into the other room and play with your toys . My father is sitting there in his chair and he is studying too , one of his important books . He has a pencil to underline anything that he thinks might bep183useful for him to remember . I am my mother and I am always thinking about my darling children . The dinner dishes have been washed and perhaps later your father will put a record on the victrola . " " I want to play with the toys now . " " Later , dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other dearly . Do n't we ? " " I guess so , " Fancy said uncertainly . " We love each other very very dearly . We are always thinking of ways to make each other happy , are n't we ? Right now your father is working hard because he is dreaming of someday taking his family to live in a lovely house he will build for them , and I am your mother and I am thinking of how strong and happy and handsome my children are . Are n't I always thinking of you ? " " I guess so . " " My darling little Frances will grow up to be a lovely woman , tall and fair , and someday she will find a man who is as good as her father , and she will marry him and they will have strong and happy and handsome children of their own . But my son Richard will never marry ; he will stay with his mother always , standing by his father , so I will always have a strong wise man on either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear my mother calling me , " she said , moving toward the door . Aunt Fanny looked at her mournfully . " Do you know that they are dead now ? " she asked . " They were your great grand-parents . " " Yes , Aunt Fanny . May I go now ? " " Run along , Frances , " Aunt Fanny said remotely . When the door closed behind Fancy she sat quietly in her mother 's chair , wondering at the quiet in her mother 's rooms . When she closedp184the door behind her at last , and locked it , she thought : somedaysomeone will come again , and wonder who lived here . " Here comes Aunt Fanny now , " said Mrs. Willow as Aunt Fanny came down the great stairway , " Aunt Fanny , come and decide something for us . We ca n't make up our minds about breakfast that first morning  --  would you think ham and eggs ? " " No , " Fancy said , as though continuing a conversation begunlong before , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky . " " So have you . " Gloria took up a little doll from the doll house and examined him curiously . " You 've always lived here , for one thing . " " People growing up . . . " Fancy 's voice faded ; she seemed to be trying very hard to phrase something only very imperfectly perceived ; she laughed timidly , and reached out to touch Gloria 's arm . " It 's easier , being young and growing up , " she said haltingly , " when there are other people around doing it with you . You know , when you can think that all over the world there are children your age , growing up , and all of them somehowfeeling the same . But suppose . . . suppose you were the only child growing up . " She shook her head . " You were lucky , " she said . " I have n't altogether grown up yet . " " Gloria , wo n't you miss things like dancing , and boys , and going to parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games ? I 've been waiting a long time for all the things like that , and now . . . " " I can only think we 'll have other things as good . Anyway , we 'll be safe . " " Who wants to be safe , for heaven 's sakes ? " Fancy was scornful . " I 'd rather live in a world full of other people , evenp185dangerous people . I 've been safe all my life . I 've never even played with anyone , except my dolls . " Once again she was thoughtful , moving her hand along the corner of the doll house in a gesture oddly reminiscent of her grandmother . " If I could , " she said at last , " I would make it stop , all of this . " " Maybe they all feel the same way , really , " Gloria said ; she too , speaking of something not quite understood , spoke awkwardly . " I think they want the same things you do , only you would . . . inherit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things like excitement , and new experiences , and all kinds of strange and wonderful things happening ; you get them anyway , just by the process of growing older , but for them . . . they 've alreadyoutgrown all they know and they want to try it all over again . Even at my age , you keep thinking you 've missed so much , and you get older all the time . " " But what is there left that people like Aunt Fanny and Mrs. Willow are waiting for ? What do they think can possibly happen nice to them now ? " " I ca n't answer all your questions , silly . I do n't know myself . All I know is that being safe is more important than anything else . " " No , " Fancy said . " No , it ca n't be . " " I 'm only seventeen years old , " Gloria said , " and I know this much  --  that world out there , Fancy , that world which is all around on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's real inside here , we 're real , but what is outside is like it 's made of cardboard , or plastic , or something . Nothing out there is real . Everything is made out of something else , and everything is made to look like something else , and it all comes apart in your hands . The people are n't real , they 're nothing but endless copies of each other , all looking just alike , like paper dolls , and they live in houses full of artificial things and eat imitation food  --  "  | " My doll house , " Fancy said , amused . " Your dolls have little cakes and roasts made of wood and painted . Well , the people out there have cakes and bread and cookies made out of pretend flour , with all kinds of things taken out of it to make it prettier for them to eat , and all kinds of things put in to make it easier for them to eat , and they eat meat which has been cooked for them already so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat it up and they read newspapers full of nonsense and lies and one day they hear that some truth is being kept from them for their own good and the next day they hear that the truth is being kept from them because it was really a lie and the next day they hear  --  " Fancy laughed . " You sound like you hate everything . " " I would n't like being a doll in a doll house , I can tell you . I 'm only seventeen years old , but I 've learned a lot . All those people out there know about things like love and tenderness is what they hear in songs or read in books  --  that 's one reason I 'm glad we burned all the books here . People should n't be able to read them and remember nothing but lies . And you talk about dances and parties  --  I can tell you there 's no heart to anything any more ; when you dance with a boy he 's only looking over your shoulder at some other boy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the television screens . " " If I believed you , " Fancy said , " I would still mind never trying things for myself . But I wo n't ever believe you until I 've gone out there and seen it . " " There 's nothing there , " Gloria said with finality . " It 's a make-believe world , with nothing in it but cardboard and trouble . " She thought for a minute , and then said , " If you were a liar , or a pervert , or a thief , or even just sick , there would n't be anything out there you could n't have . " Fancy bent over the doll house . " Anyway , " she said , " I don'tp187care how shabby it is . I 'm not afraid of bad people , and of not being safe . " " But there are n't any good people , " Gloria said helplessly . " No one is anything but tired and ugly and mean . I know . " The first Mr. Halloran had been accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " The more haste , the less speed , " he was fond of remarking , " There 's always room at the top ; you ca n't take it with you . " His battery of architects and landscape technicians had declined , as one man , to adorn Mr. Halloran 's home with elaborately painted and carved and engraved statements that Mr. Halloran could not take it with him , but had in many cases compromised with Mr. Halloran 's passion for the reassuring presence of a line of good advice . Mr. Halloran  --  who kept on his desk a framed copy of Kipling 's " If "  --  felt that every human soul was the better for the nudging presence of sound words , and it was only the tactful intervention of a young man  --  the nephew of the principal architect , in fact  --  who had taken a master 's degree in English literature at Columbia University , that prevented a final rupture between Mr. Halloran and the principal architect , the one declaringthat he would go to his death rather than see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man is always the better for a friend , " and the other , with a tenaciousness basic to his personality , stubbornly leafing through a volume of familiar quotations and asking whose money was paying for this house ? The young fellow , who had taken a master 's degree in English literature at Columbia University , had suggested that Mr. Halloran could have his maxims without doing extreme violence to the feelings of the architect , by favoring a more learned and poetic use of words ; in any case , the student pointed out , the difference of meaning and intention between one maxim and another was almost non-existent , and there was nop188more vital change in conduct suggested by " You ca n't take it with you " than " When shall we live if not now ? " Thus the gilded and elegantly presented suggestions on many of the walls of Mr. Halloran 's house ; ineffectual , certainly  --  in spite of the framed copy of Kipling 's " If , " Mr. Halloran continuedall his days to accumulate nothing except money  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a matter of indifference that they dined , exhorted to " Let none save good companions grace this festive board " or slept , assured " Get up , get up for shame , the blooming morn Upon her wings presents the god unshorn , " or even " Hated by fools , and fools to hate , Be that my motto and my fate , " or mounted the stairs reading , " When shall we live if not now ? " When the student , carried away in a kind of Strawberry Hill intoxication , suggested that Mr. Halloran cause a grotto to be constructed on the grounds of the big house , Mr. Halloran 's first anxiety  --  before even making any definite attempt to determinewhat a grotto might be , or might be for , or might requirein the way of furnishings , since if it existed he meant to have it  --  was to ensure that proper and suitable mottos would be charmingly placed upon its walls . Mr. Halloran 's dim notion of a grotto held that a grotto was enticingly cool in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " Fear no more the heat of the sun , " the grotto was to say in some manner , and upon this Mr. Halloranwas firm . The student maintained , maligning Horry Walpole mercilessly , that a grotto was no grotto at all unless it overlooked a lake , and Mr. Halloran , who had already an ornamental pool on the garden front of his house , set his builders doggedly to work to construct a lake at the far end of the grounds ; at two points , in fact , it touched the wall . The grotto was built of rock near the lake , earth heaped over it , and grass and flowers trainedp189to grow on top in sweet wild profusion , and on the rock wall of the grotto inside was written , in letters of blue touched with gilt , " Fear no more the heat of the sun . " The entire air of the grotto was faintly that of a Strawberry Hill confection , and it would have been vastly improved by the presence of a party of ladies , resting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a love of a wilderness we have covered , " the air just breathed ; " hark ; are the gentlemen back from their riding ? " ) ; or at the very least a dainty repast of fruits and ices , with vine leaves for plates and the entire chorus from the King 's Theatre to float , fairylike and singing , in pleasure boats over the small waves . Perhaps not all of this was apparent to Mr. Halloran . He did not care for his grotto , after all , because it was damp , and the lake was an irritation to him , reminding him always of how messy it had been to construct , and he had never been able to bring his wife there and write her name among the rocks . Worst of all , after the swans which originally swam in the ornamental pool had bitten young Richard and two housemaids they were sent to endure a lonely disgrace on the grotto-lake , where they bred and quarrelled , and were an unending annoyanceand menace to the gardeners . As a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep incoherent love over every part of the grounds enclosedby the wall , had spent some amount of time in the grotto , watching the water of the lake move under the soft wind , hidingfrom the swans , and catching any number of head-colds . Now , older and more susceptible to influenzas and grippes , she came to the grotto less often , and yet every now and then she was irresistibly moved to walk in that direction . During the later days of July , in fact , Aunt Fanny made a kind of pilgrimageto all of her favorite haunts , to admire once more her father 's handiwork and hope , somehow , to engrave upon herp190memory the well-loved spots which were so soon to dissolve utterly . It should perhaps be recorded that the young master from Columbia University , who had hoped for so much from Mr. Halloran 's grotto and had even led himself to believe that Mr. Halloran would be of some use to him in return , in furthering his chosen career , the writing of plays in blank verse , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Halloran and was rewarded by the offer of a position as file clerk in Mr. Halloran 's organization , from which he subsequently rose to the position of chief clerk , and got married . Aunt Fanny came to the grotto in late July ; it had been perhapssix months since she had last seen it , and she was struck at once with its air of mournful neglect ; the roses still grew on its head , and the lake still moved gently under the soft wind , but the walls inside , which had been painted blue and green and gold , were faded , and the paint had chipped . A rock had cracked away from the entrance ; " Fear no more the heat of the sun , " had almost gone . The little rustic benches and tables which had been in the grotto were broken and rotted . Far out over the lake the swans , wholly wild now , moved in distant patterns and Aunt Fanny , hoping that they would not notice her moving , ducked quietly into the grotto and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three of the rustic chairs and tables across the entrance so that the swans , if they pursued her , could not get in . Aunt Fanny was really quite angry , angrier than she had ever been before in her life . She was angry at her sister-in-law for planning to wear a crown , and angry at her brother for not preventing it and for letting his wife look like a fool before the villagers . She was angry at Miss Ogilvie and Maryjane and Essexfor their passivity and their humble subjection to Mrs. Halloran'severy whim . She was most particularly angry , far andp191beyond any anger she had ever known before , at Mrs. Halloran , for having that morning given Aunt Fanny a carbon  --  and a carbon , Aunt Fanny thought furiously , not even the first copy  --  of a typewritten page headed INSTRUCTIONS and composed by Mrs. Halloran herself , with no reference to Aunt Fanny . Sitting in the grotto , Aunt Fanny took out the paper and read it again . INSTRUCTIONSWe all know what is going to happen on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general good , and III each of us must preserve carefully this page of instructions as a constantreference . ANY DEVIATION FROM THESE RULES WILL BE SUBJECT TO PUNISHMENT. 1 . No person is to leave the big house , for any reason whatsoever , after four o'clock in the afternoon on August thirtieth. 2 . Under no circumstances is any person from outside to enter the house after that time. 3 . Since the servants and staff will be leaving the house by noontime , it is expected that no special demands will be made for their services , after midnight on August twenty-ninth. 4 . Due to the unusual conditions which will be existing outside the house on the night of August thirtieth , it has been decided that precautions must be taken to protect windows , etc . All persons re-mainingin the house will begin work immediately after the departure of the servants at noon to board up , cover with blankets , and in all possible fashions barricade all windows and doors . Mrs. Halloran will make herself responsible for explaining this action to Mr. Halloran. 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at four o'clock on the afternoon of August thirtieth , for a light meal , and last-minute instructions from Mrs. Halloran. 6 . No one is to leave the drawing room during the night of August thirtieth. 7 . It is expected that all persons remaining in the big house willp192so attire themselves as to greet the morning suitably , although a certain consideration of the probable fluctuations in temperature , etc. , must be observed . No one except Mrs. Halloran may wear a crown. 8 . When the morning arrives , Mrs. Halloran will lead the way to the door , everyone following in sober procession . Mrs. Halloran will be the first to step outside. 9 . Since , for all practical purposes , the present calendar will lose all significance after the night of August thirtieth , the following morning will be referred to , from this time on , as The First Day. 10 .

On The First Day , and thereafter , wanton running , racing , swimming , play of various kinds , and such manifestations of irresponsibilitywill of course not be permitted . It is expected that all members of the party will keep in mind their positions as inheritors of the world , and conduct themselves accordingly . A proud dignity is recommended , and extreme care lest offense be given to supernaturaloverseers who may perhaps be endeavoring to determine the fitness of their choice of survivors .

Aunt Fanny , moving in fear , pressed herself back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green and gold swam and curled around her , and she knew at once who was standing in the doorway.  | " BUT I do n't want to see anything , " Gloria insisted crossly . " You can just get someone else to try , that 's all . I 'm simply not interested in gawking into that silly mirror any more . " " Dear , " Mrs. Willow said soothingly , " try to be calm . Naturallyyou ca n't see anything anyway when you 're so excited ; try to relax and think of the rest of us . " " Perhaps the lovely countries of the future have lost their savor for Gloria , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Perhaps Gloria is dreaming still of a world of wicker furniture and a job ushering in a movie theatre ; perhaps Gloria longs to repudiate all of us . " Gloria turned , astonished , to stare at Essex , and he smiled a little , and shrugged . " That was nasty , " Fancy said to Gloria , " but I told you he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Halloran said smoothly , smiling at Gloria . " His interest is thus in the good of the community as a whole ; individual whims can not be allowed to interfere , I think , with our general future . " " Essex is a pig , " Fancy said , and put her hand into Gloria 's . " Did n't I tell you , Gloria ? " " Essex , " Mrs. Halloran said , " tell Gloria that she must look into the mirror , or risk my displeasure . " " Gloria ? " said Essex , looking aside.  | " There 's nothing in there , " Gloria said sullenly . " It 's just a dirty old mirror covered with oil . " " Orianna , we will all see this country soon enough , " Aunt Fanny put in . " It is not necessary to force Gloria to look again .

" " I 'm sick and tired of hearing you bully everybody , " Fancy said flatly to her grandmother , and there was a long , waiting moment of silence . Then Maryjane spoke , weakly but stubbornly , " Fancy 's right , " she said . " You can just stop bossing me around , for one . " " Always so difficult to know what to do , " Aunt Fanny murmured . " Family quarrels , " Miss Ogilvie agreed . " Well , the way I see it , " Mrs. Willow swept nobly into the fray , " everyone 's gotten kind of on everyone else 's nerves , and pretty soon if we do n't look out we 're all going to be sniping at each other  --  what I used to say to my gels , when they were young things pulling hair over some toy  --  what I used to say , birds in their little nests agree , and what I 'd like to know  --  are we or are we not a pack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Such a gift for the apt phrase , " Mrs. Halloran said . " I personallydeplore this evidence of frayed nerves ; we do not have much longer to wait , after all , and perhaps if we can not containourselves we had better remain decently apart . " She looked at Gloria . " I will only point out once more that I have undertakena tremendous responsibility in arranging to lead you all into this new world , and I expect complete cooperation ; Maryjane , I do not think you can rightly call it bossing you aroundp195when I ask that you exert your dubious talents to the utmost to ensure our mutual safety ? " " Just do n't try always bossing me , is all , " Maryjane said sullenly . " Well , I guess we all know where we stand now , " the captainsaid heartily . " Mrs. Halloran , we all know the little lady did n't mean to disobey you by not looking into the mirror for you ; got to make allowances for a little female jealousy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Honestly ! " " I am satisfied , " Mrs. Halloran said . " In consideration of the captain 's sensible explanation of your motives , Gloria , we will excuse you for tonight . " Gloria stood up and crossed the room to face Essex , who leaned against the back of Mrs. Halloran 's chair . " Essex , " she said , " I want to ask you once more , in front of everybody . There 's still time . They could n't stop us if we really wanted to go . We would have two weeks at least . " " Do n't be silly , Gloria . " Essex stared down at his hands on the back of Mrs. Halloran 's chair . " I would n't leave for anything in the world , " he said . " I think you have been fairly answered , Gloria , " Mrs. Halloransaid amiably . " Goodnight . " " I think you must be really crazy , " Fancy said . She was sitting on the foot of Gloria 's bed , looking like a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother so close to really mad . " " She 's a terrible old woman . But you were nice to speak up for me , Fancy . " " And what do you think of Essex now ? " Fancy giggled . " He 's a kind of a poor fish , " she said . " And I told you so . " " Poor Essex , " said Gloria unreasonably . " What I ca n't figure , " Fancy said , pulling at a tuft in thep196blanket , " is why you tell me it 's so terrible outside and then make such a fool out of yourself asking Essex to come away with you , right in front of everybody . " " Maybe I did n't really want him to leave . Maybe I only wanted him to say he would . " " Well , you know now , " Fancy said unsympathetically . " She would n't let him go any more than she let the captain go . " " I 've been wondering . " Gloria sat up in bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time your grandmotherkeeps telling us how hard and how serious and how tremendous it is , our waiting here till it all happens , and how careful we 've got to be , and how much responsibility she 's got for seeing that we do n't get ourselves into trouble and how we only have her to direct us and we have to do what she says and how we ca n't run and play and be happy in that nice country  --  " " Well ? We do n't any of us know what it 's going to be like , do we ? " " I do , " Gloria said . " I 've seen it in the mirror . And in the mirror it was n't like that at all . In the mirror , your grandmother has n't ever even been there . " Essex spoke boldly . " I believe , Orianna , " he said , " that you have made a very grave mistake . I would never have believed that you could be so much in error . " " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mistaken my motives ? " " I doubt it , " Essex said with some irony . " You have seriously compromised your authority . " " By suppressing that girl 's insolence ? You had your choice , Essex ; you had only to agree to accompany her . " " You tried to turn me out of the house once , I recall . Perhaps , having stayed then , I lost the ability to go . " Mrs. Halloran smiled , almost wistfully in the dusk of thep197garden . " It has already begun , " she said . " Some months ago I told you that , once committed to the belief in Aunt Fanny 's bright world , I was committed absolutely , but I would not go second to Aunt Fanny or to anyone else . " " Where will you be when you can no longer turn us out of your house ? " " It is my house now , and it will be my house then . I will not relinquish one stone of it in this world or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember that I will not relinquish , either , one fraction of my authority . Perhaps , " she added drily , " just as you have lost the ability to leave , I have lost the ability to serve . " " I assume then , that you have no real faith in the fondness any of the rest of us may feel for you ? " " None , " said Mrs. Halloran . Mrs. Halloran breakfasted with her husband the next morning , in order to explain to him the plans for the last day and night . When Gloria came into the breakfast room where the others were sitting , she was flushed , and bright-eyed , and almostrunning . " Listen , " she began , as she came through the door , " I 've got to tell you right away ; I never expected anything like it . I was combing my hair just now  --  and I never even finished  --  look , " and , laughing a little , she pushed her hands through her tangled hair , " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looking at myself and then without any kind of warning my own reflection just vanished from the glass and I was looking through again , and this time I was walking . I was right inside , you see ; I was at the top of a little hill and down below I could see great fields of flowers , the red flowers I saw before , I think , and bluebells , and what must have been the same little stream , sparkling and bright and clean  --  " " Any people ? " It was Mrs. Willow , softly  | " No , only me . I started to run down through the grass and when I came to the foot of the hill I jumped right across the little stream and on the other side I ran into a little forest and I was barefoot , because I can still feel how the moss felt under my feet . " She stopped for breath , and they all sat quietly , listening . " And there were birds singing , and  --  oh , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely it was !  --  and flowers , and everything was so gentle and warm and light ; it is going to be so beautiful , " and she looked around at all of them with tears in her eyes . " I do n't think I ever really believed it , completely , before . " She turned , half-laughing , to Essex . " I do n't even hate you , " she said . Essex rose gravely and took her hand to lead her to the table . " Your shrine , " he said , " will be set in a forest of ash trees . The oracle will manifest itself through the great movement of the leaves and the flights of clouds of starlings . I will cause to be constructed an image of yourself as a young goddess ; offerings favorably received will be grapes and other sweet fruit , colored pebbles , and sweet grasses ; acceptable sacrifices will include the otter and the young of soft-footed animals , such as the leopard . " Gloria smiled at Essex . " I will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show you the place where you can run down the hill and jump across the stream and go into the trees , and we will find an ash grove for our shrine . " " Are there reeds in the stream ? " the captain asked . " We will make young Fancy here a flute , and she can pipe for us . " Fancy giggled . " You will all have to follow me and dance , " and Maryjane added shyly , " We can put flowers in our hair , those red ones , and dance under the trees . " " Pagan abandon , " said Mrs. Willow indulgently . " Pagan abandon , indeed , " said Mrs. Halloran dangerously from the doorway . " Can you not realize that you are already breaking my laws ? "  |p199TOWARD  the end of August the weather turned strange ; variousand unusual phenomena were reported from one end of the country to the other : freak snow storms , hurricanes , hail from a clear sky . Around the big house there were thunderstorms every afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass blackly on the horizon shortly after four o'clock , and moving with speed until in an hour the sky was black , and , by six , clear again . If the first Mr. Halloran had been alive he might have pointed out that although everyone talked about the weather , no one did anything about it ; there were cases of death from heat and death from drowning and death from wind in each morning 's newspaper , along with statements that the earth 's surface was being lowered into the oceans at the rate of two inches a century ; a volcano which had been dormant for five hundred years erupted , blasted its surrounding countryside , and fell asleep again forever . A woman in Chicago was arrested for leading a polar bear clipped like a French poodle into a large downtown departmentstore . A man in Texas won a divorce from his wife because she tore out the last chapter of every mystery story he borrowed from the library . A television set in Florida refused to let itself be turned off ; until its owners took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , presenting inferior music and stale moviesp200and endless , maddening advertising , and even under the axe , with its last sigh , it died with the praises of a hair tonic on its lips . Mrs. Halloran 's crown arrived , and she wore it to dinner . " I expect you will soon be accustomed to seeing me wear a crown , " she said amiably down the dinner table . " After all , it is not the least of the adjustments we will be called upon to make . " " It is less regal than I had anticipated , " Essex said politely . " My sister-in-law , " Aunt Fanny told Essex , " has never been remarkable for her good taste or  --  what shall I call it ?  --  family background ; I think that tonight , however , she has surpassed herself . " " I kind of like it , " Mary jane said . " I wish I 'd thought of it first . " " Like calls to like , " Aunt Fanny said darkly . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Willow said , looking in perplexity from one to another , " I just do n't understandall this carping and good taste talk ; stands to reason , far as I can see , that Orianna here is going to be the boss from now on , the way she 's always been up to now , so why ca n't she wear what she pleases ? Well ? " She stared at Aunt Fanny . " Been taking a little too much on yourself , have n't you ? " she demanded . " Maybe you thought you ought to be the queen and wear a crown ? " and Mrs. Willow laughed shortly . " My father  --  " " Your father  --  I just guess we 've heard about all we can takeof your father  --  we do n't even know it was your father . " " Mrs. Willow . " Aunt Fanny rose in white-faced indignaton . " Are you suggesting that I am illegitimate ? " Mrs. Halloran put in smoothly , " Aunt Fanny , sit down , please .

Thank you , Gloria , for not troubling to spare my feelings ; I wonder if it is not too late for you to join your father ? " " And tell him you 're a crazy old lady who sits at her dinner table with a crown on her head ? " " I wish you all found my wearing a crown less annoying . " Mrs. Halloran touched the crown tenderly ; it was not , after all , of any great magnificence ; if she had not persisted in calling it a crown Mrs. Halloran might very well have been suspected of wearing only a plain gold band around her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not to call me a crazy old lady . I am no older than Mrs. Willow , I am certain that I am not crazy , and Aunt Fanny will remove any doubts you have as to my being a lady . In any case , you were discourteous . " " I apologize , " Gloria said sincerely . " I am your guest , Mrs. Halloran , and it was not right of me to call you names . I certainlydo n't like your crown , but I do not think that I have any right to stop you from wearing it . " " Are we going to go on worrying about Mrs. Halloran 's crown all night ? " the captain demanded . " I thought we were supposed to be making plans for the party . " He nudged Arabella . " The last orgy , " he said . " Wicked . " Arabella giggled.  |p202Miss  INVERNESS was wearing grey taffeta , and Miss Deborah Inverness was dressed in pink chiffon . Both had wide hats , flowered , because they had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious to admire any preparations which had been made for the party , and got out of the village taxi before the entrance front of the house , were met by Gloria and Mrs. Willow , and escorted along the garden path , past the barbecue pit where coals were already heating , to the terrace where Mrs. Halloran sat in a great chair . Mrs. Halloran 's golden canopy had been extended a little , to make it more of a general shelter and less a personal tribute to Mrs. Halloran , but she was wearing her golden dress and her crown . The Misses Inverness approached , hands out , and greeted Mrs. Halloran , Aunt Fanny , Maryjane , and Essex , in scrupulous order . " It is nice to see you again , " Miss Deborah said to Aunt Fanny , timidly , because Aunt Fanny had been so very distressingthe last time they met ; Miss Deborah and , to a lesser extent , her sister , were anxious to make Aunt Fanny understand that they bore no grudge ; did not , indeed , believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So very nice to see you again , " Miss Deborah said , and then , perceiving Miss Ogilvie in the background , " Miss Ogilvie ; this is nice . " " Do you like my crown ? " Mrs. Halloran asked directly.  | " A crown ? " said Miss Inverness , bewildered . " I confess I had not thought of it as a crown , Mrs. Halloran . It looked to me like a substitute for a hat . " " It is a crown , " Mrs. Halloran said complacently . " Well , I am sure it is very becoming . Although , of course , for general wear ... " " I certainly intend to wear it generally , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Perhaps not suitable for everybody . . . But very handsome , nevertheless . An Heirloom ? " Miss Inverness was puzzled for compliments . " It will be . " " Of considerable value , I imagine . I am of course not inquiringthe price . " " Of inestimable value , " Mrs. Halloran said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My sister and I , " Miss Inverness went on to Aunt Fanny , " were brought up to believe in nobility of character , and to disdain baubles of rank . But we would certainly not impose our opinions upon others . " " Not , at least , " Aunt Fanny said , " on my brother 's wife . Who was clearly brought up to value baubles of rank and let nobility of character alone . " " Are you still talking about my crown ? " Mrs. Halloran asked . " About your regal bearing , Mrs. Halloran . " " And what it covers , " Aunt Fanny put in maliciously . Mrs. Halloran laughed . " It covers a regal position , " she said . " Had you ever thought of wearing a crown , Miss Inverness ? " Miss Inverness stiffened . " In Paradise . . . a princely diadem ... " she said . " Although my father was an agnostic . " " It comforts me , " Mrs. Halloran said , " to reflect upon the Misses Inverness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment 's pity for the late Mr. Inverness . I remember him . "  | " Religious discussion is not for the drawing room , Mrs. Halloran . My father determined his own afterlife . " " You chide me , Miss Inverness . But I am still sorry for your father . " " My father , " Aunt Fanny said , anxious to avert what seemed to her a rising crisis , " was a splendid man . I recall that he mentioned your father , Miss Inverness , most affectionately . " " In any case , " Miss Deborah said gently , " it does not look so very much like a crown , sister . A simple gold band  --  " Miss Inverness glanced at her sister , and then said firmly , " How perfectly beautiful the grounds look , Mrs. Halloran . You must be very proud of them , " but Mrs. Halloran had turned to greet the school teacher and Mr. Armstrong the postmaster . At first the lawn looked pleasingly empty under the japanese lanterns , with the Misses Inverness strolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Armstrong and the school teacher , greeting the Misses Inverness and wandering aside to look briefly on the sundial , and then a group of the villagers who had arrived together in one car , and straggled out onto the lawn . Mrs. Willow turned over her position at the entrance front to Arabella , and joined the captain in the large tent on the lawn from which champagne was to be served . The beef roasts sizzled and splattered over the barbecue pit , and Julia was sent to supervisethe setting out of additional food in the second tent , near the barbecue pit . Mrs. Halloran remained in her chair on the terrace , and each guest was brought to greet her individually . Aunt Fanny and Miss Ogilvie began gradually to steer the guests toward the champagne tent , where Mrs. Willow reassureddoubters about the intoxicating properties of champagne , which , although largely unknown to the villagers , was , Mrs. Halloran had thought , the only appropriate beverage to serve.  |p205The  captain , in contrivance with Essex and without Mrs. Halloran'sknowledge , had laid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer with champagne , may have been responsiblefor the general feeling of well-being which was spreading swiftly along the lawn . Essex and Gloria had seemingly determined to avoid one another . Gloria remained at the entrance and Essex hovered over Mrs. Halloran , running small errands and supervising , like a general from a point of vantage , the small skirmishes which made the great movements of the battle on the lawn . When Gloria brought guests to greet Mrs. Halloran she moved silentlypast Essex , and Mrs. Halloran , amused , noticed each small gesture of mutual indifference , but did not comment . The general movement on the lawn was clockwise , guests coming down from the terrace after greeting Mrs. Halloran , entering into the circular turn of the crowd , going past the sundial , admiring the view and the japanese lanterns from midwaydown the great lawn , which was as far as the party had strayed so far , then on into the champagne tent and out again , to continue the same vague round . The Misses Inverness , each having touched a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group on chairs provided for them by Essex , and old Mrs. Peabody , mother to the Mr. Peabody who kept the CarriageStop Inn , had been seated nearby ; little groups of people paused to speak to them and moved on . The villagers , who knew one another intimately at home , now behaved toward one another more formally , under Mrs. Halloran 's eye . Mrs. Peabody , who knew to the day which funeral had last brought to public view the blue serge suit of Mr. Straus , the butcher , and why the younger Watkins boy had come after all , and how much Mrs. Halloran had been overchargedfor the champagne , was highly amused by the wholeparty and had been heard to observe that the first Mr. Halloran Iip206had always had too much sense to invite the villagers to his house . " And , " she added to the captain , who was bringing her a glass of champagne , " in his time , we would have had too much sense to come . " " Baubles of rank , " Miss Inverness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pride of place . " " My father always took such an interest in all of you . " Aunt Fanny beamed tenderly upon Mr. Straus , the butcher , and Mrs. Otis , who gave dancing lessons . " He thought of you as .. . personal friends , I really believe . He was a fine man . " " A fine man , " Mrs. Otis said obediently , and Mr. Straus nodded heavily . " I remember , " Aunt Fanny said , " when he first spoke of building the big house , he thought at once of you villagers . ' We must take care of them always , ' he said . ' They will look to us for guidance and security . ' " " Of course we do , " said Mrs. Otis , and Mr. Straus nodded . " I think you will have to concede , " Aunt Fanny went on , " that we in the big house have always treated you well . Even now  --  our only thought in having this expensive lawn party was for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pleased . " " I am sure he would , " Mrs. Otis said , and Mr. Straus nodded . " Of course , " Aunt Fanny said , " and believe me , I am most reluctant to bring it up , but of course , you will see at once that , no matter how fond we have grown of all of you , we can hardly , now , persuade my father to include you . I am sure he will regret it as much as any of us ; I am sure that losing you grieves him bitterly . " " He was a fine man , " Mrs. Otis said , bewildered , and Mr.p207Straus nodded . " He was a man who liked a good roast of beef , " Mr. Straus said . " Miss Ogilvie ? " said Essex politely , " Miss Ogilvie as a child was violated by a band of Comanche Indians in a lonely farmhouseon Little Wicked Bend River . It has left her taciturn . " " Good heavens ! " Miss Deborah turned her head slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've known Miss Ogilvie for years , " Miss Deborah said , " and she never breathed a word . " " It 's not the sort of thing one mentions , you know , " Essex said . " I only learned it quite by accident . " " Poor Miss Ogilvie ; if we had only known , my sister and I , perhaps we could have done something . Ah . . . comforted her , perhaps . Do you think I might mention it to her ? " " Under no circumstances , " said Essex with some haste . " I believe it would be extremely harmful , extremely . After all , the memory has been successfully buried for so long ... " " But bringing these things out into the open air  --  sister ! " Miss Deborah called , " I really must tell you ; Mr. Essex has just given me the most alarming information . Poor Miss Ogilvie ! And we never knew ! " " I am doing all I can to make your party a success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrace . " All it lacks , actually , " Mrs. Halloran said , " is the head of the Cheshire Cat looking down on us from the sky . " She looked from the terrace onto the sizable crowd now moving more freely on the lawn . The sundial stood out clearly , since no one went really close to it , and it stood by itself , a small island , in the moving people . From the terrace the sound of voices was a little distant , murmuring , with now and then the clear round bellowp208of Mrs. Willow , saying , " The little bubbles tickle your nose , " or , " The drink of angels , I promise you ; fit for any king . " " If we had a Cheshire Cat , " Essex said , pleased , " Mrs. Willowcould be the Duchess . " " As I recall , the Duchess was under sentence of execution for boxing the Queen 's ears . " Mrs. Halloran laughed . " Off with their heads ! " she said . Gloria came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Essex , " They sent me to tell you that the barbecue was ready , and everything is ready to be served in the barbecue tent . " " Essex , " Mrs. Halloran said , " can you communicate with these people ? " Essex came from the terrace down into the crowd . " The food is ready , " he said to Mr. Straus . " Follow the path around to the left . " " Righto , " Mr. Straus said . " Happen to know the quality of the meat . " He took Aunt Fanny on one arm and Mrs. Otis on the other arm and made purposefully for the barbecue ; Essex moved on , urging the Misses Inverness into action , turning peopletoward the right path , nudging , stirring , like a sheep dog turning a flock of sheep toward the fold : " The barbecue is ready , " he said over and over , " follow the path to the left , " and obediently , the people standing with champagne cups in their hands listened , nodded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second tent . " The old lady has done herself proud , " Mr. Atkins from the hardware store said to the school teacher , and the school teacher , who had never tasted champagne before , nodded hazily and giggled . " Now come on everybody , " , and then eat hearty  --  it may be the last meal you ever get . " People laughed , and asked one another what was in the salad dressing , and handed around plates ; someone gave the schoolp209teacher a full plate of meat and salad and rolls and two little chocolate cupcakes and the school teacher , giggling and swaying , held it precariously for a minute or so and then set it down on a chair and went after more champagne . " That 's a good piece of meat , " Mr. Straus said to Mrs. Willow , and Mrs. Willow slapped him on the shoulder and said richly , " You 'll never eat better again , so go at it , my boy . " " Delicious , " said Miss Inverness , tasting delicately of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates , with tiny servings at which they were nibbling with tiny bites . " Everythingalways tastes so much better out of doors , " said Miss Deborah . She sighed , changing her plate from one hand to the other , and glanced longingly at the lighted windows of the big house . It was growing darker ; faces which had a few minutes ago been clearly visible were fading , so that only in the light of the great barbecue fire was an occasional countenance familiar , reddenedand in many cases dirty . Mr. Straus hung lovingly over the man who , white-jacketed and sober , went on endlessly carvingthin curling slices of meat onto a huge wooden platter ; beyond him the fires flared and spattered when the barbecue sauce went onto the coals , and beyond the fires the silent darkness of the rose garden and the farther trees descended , hiding successfully the youngest Watkins boy and Julia Willow , who had taken a bottle of champagne and decided to skip dinner . " Cuts like butter , " Mr. Straus said , watching the carver with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyeing her untouchedplate . " I have no appetite , " she said . " Being a queen is a very public penance . " " Perhaps I could get you a little something from the kitchen ? " Miss Ogilvie , hovering solicitously , made little futilep210dabs at her own plate , clearly unwilling to seem to be enjoying her food . Mrs. Halloran sighed . ' Run along and get yourself some champagne , " she said . " Dream of pressing your own grapes . " When Miss Ogilvie had gone scurrying down toward the champagne tent , where some few revellers still lingered , Mrs. Halloran rose . She looked once down the long fine sweep of the lawn , where the sundial was still faintly visible , white against the dark grass , and glanced at the pale shape of the tent , where faint laughter persisted . From the barbecue pit she could hear voices raised , the sounds of fire , and the touching of forks against plates ; over it all Mrs. Willow urging , " Eat hearty , friends , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down her plate and opened the great door ; she had set her chair against it as though guarding the house . She went into the black and white tiled entrance hall ; " When shall we live if not now ? " she read over the staircase , and it seemed all at once an echo of Mrs. Willow . Moving quickly , Mrs. Halloran went into the right wing where Mr. Halloran sat before his fire . His dinner tray was on the small table near him , untouched ; " Nurse ? " Mr. Halloran said , not turning around , " Nurse , I have not had my dinner yet . " " Good evening , Richard , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Orianna ? " said Mr. Halloran , peering uncertainly around the wing of his chair . " Orianna , I have not been given my dinneryet . Nurse has not given me my dinner . " " She has probably been tempted by the party outside , " Mrs. Halloran said , " but do not distress yourself , Richard ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will let Nurse celebrate while she can . " " I do n't want oatmeal , " Mr. Halloran said pettishly . " If it 's oatmeal you must send it back and have them make me somethingelse. "  |p211Mrs  . Halloran lifted the silver cover from a bowl ; " It 's two splendid soft-cooked eggs , " she said . " And I believe a nice hot broth , and a pretty little pudding . " " But Nurse is not here to feed me , " Mr. Halloran said crossly . " Then you will see how well I can do it . " Mrs. Halloran tied the napkin under his chin , and opened the eggs carefully . Then she moved the nurse 's low stool beside him , and sat down with the tray beside her . " Eggs first ? " she asked . " I want the broth , " Mr. Halloran said . " I think the broth may be too warm , Richard . " Mrs. Hallorantook up a little of the broth and blew on it to cool it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her husband 's mouth . He accepted it obediently , and swallowed , and Mrs. Halloran took another spoonful and held it ready . " It 's too hot , " Mr. Halloran said . " Nurse always gives me my eggs first . " " Then we 'll try the eggs , " Mrs. Halloran said . " I want the pudding , " Mr. Halloran said at once . " Then we 'll try the pudding . " " Why was I not sent oatmeal ? They knew I wanted oatmeal tonight . " " They sent up a very pleasant dinner , Richard . Eggs , and broth , and pudding . " " Then feed it to me , " Mr. Halloran said . " Nurse is never this slow . " " Open your mouth , then . " " Are they having a party ? " Mr. Halloran said , when he had finished his mouthful . " A big party , " Mrs. Halloran said . " Ready with another spoonful . " " Why am I not going to the party ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , Richard , I will tell you about it , what everyone is doing . " " Are they going to ring the bells ? Over the carriage house ? " " A splendid idea . Open your mouth , Richard . I think we must really ring the bells . " " Who has come to this party ? " " All the people from the village . The party is for them , a treat . Right now they are around the barbecue pit , having their dinners just as you are having your dinner , and they are drinkingchampagne ; later , after you finish all your dinner , I will bring you a glass of champagne as a treat for you , too . " " No more egg , " Mr. Halloran said . " I want pudding . " " Pudding , then . We have strung lanterns back and forth across the long lawn , little colored lights along the lawn . There is a corner of the terrace where we are going to put musicians , musicians I brought all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing out on the grass under the lanterns . " " And drinking champagne . " " And drinking champagne . Since the night air is far too cool for you , I thought I would bring you into the drawing room and you may sit by the big window and watch . There , now , the pudding is gone ; you ate your pudding very nicely , Richard . " " It reminds me of when Lionel died , and we rang the bells all night . " " More egg now ? You will hear the bells , I promise you . And you will sit in the drawing room and drink a glass of champagne and watch the villagers dancing under the colored lights . " " I think not . " Mr. Halloran sighed tiredly . " I would rather stay here . I can hear the bells , you know , and I think colored lights would be too bright for my eyes . " He hit his hand irritablyagainst the arm of his chair . " I wish Nurse would come back , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not had my dinner yet ?  |p213Nurse  went off without giving me my dinner , and I do not think that is in any way proper . You must find Nurse at once and tell her I want my dinner . " " Mr. Essex . " Miss Inverness bore down heavily , glass in hand . " Mr. Essex , I must really ask an explanation from you . This distressing story which my sister has repeated to me  --  " " Distressing indeed , Miss Inverness . I can not tell you how we all deplore it . " " I think it most thoughtless and  --  yes , even tasteless  --  of Mrs. Halloran . One does not expect to meet , in nice houses , people of unsuitable background ; I have permitted my sister to become intimate with Miss Ogilvie , even help her with small purchases in our little emporium . I think it very hard that we were not told of Miss Ogilvie 's character . " " Surely not a story for general circulation , " Essex murmured . " Certainly not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat it . But , Mr. Essex , ladies should know . One assumes , all too frequently , that the mere presence of a woman in a respectable familyis enough to ensure that her reputation is above reproach . It will be very difficult , now , to know how to speak to Mrs. Hal-loran . " " It has always been difficult , " Essex said , " to know how to speak to Mrs. Halloran . " " All I can say , Mr. Essex , is that Mrs. Halloran Senior would never have allowed a person of questionable character to enter her house . This is all very hard on her memory , and I shall tell Mrs. Halloran so when I say goodnight ; naturally , my sister and I can not remain at this delightful party . We stayed only long enough to take a little refreshment , in courtesy to our hosts . " " I hope you will not find it necessary to say anything to Miss Ogilvie . " " We were brought up ladies , Mr. Essex . My mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But further association will be , of course , out of the question . " " I believe , on the whole , that it will , " Essex said . " Good night , Mr. Essex . " " Before you leave , " Essex said , lowering his voice , " there is something more I really must tell you . Since your association with this house is to be so irrevocably severed , you will want , I think , to hear the unsavory truth about Aunt Fanny ? As you know , like Miss Ogilvie , she has never married . " Miss Inverness gasped . " Not Miss Halloran too ? " " Similar , although the circumstances were different , " Essex said gravely . " I myself find Aunt Fanny 's story the more pitiable . Do you recall the year that Aunt Fanny spent abroad ? It was given out that she was in Switzerland . " " I remember , " said Miss Inverness faintly . " In actuality , " Essex said , " she had been captured by pirates off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a British man of war tracked them down and wrested Aunt Fanny from their clutches . A most horrible fate . " Miss Inverness sipped from her glass , her hand shaking . " Horrible , indeed , " she said weakly ; in the darkness she peered at Essex , leaning forward and almost whispering . " The worst , " she said . " I suppose it happened ? " " Alas , " Essex said . " May I bring you more champagne ? " Miss Inverness drained her glass . " I think yes , " she said . " We must leave , my sister and I , but at the moment I think I am slightly ill . " " Aunt Fanny , " Essex said , coming up beside her where she stood in the darkness outside the champagne tent , " Aunt Fanny , will you do me a favor ? " " Essex ? Yes , certainly , my dear . " " If Miss Inverness asks you whether you were ever capturedp215and held prisoner by pirates off the Mediterranean coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To say what ? Yes ? All right , surely , Essex . I think that will be splendid . Has anyone seen my brother tonight ? " " He was to have been moved into the drawing room , so he could watch the party . " " I daresay his wife forgot . I must really go and see to it . " " A known murderer , " Essex said happily to Miss Deborah . " Mrs. Halloran has been sheltering him from the law , or , worse , the outraged relatives of his victims . Captain ' is of course an assumed name . " " Who  --  " gasped Miss Deborah . " Whom did he kill ? Old women , mostly . Mutilated them in a most shocking fashion . " " A ... a sex murderer ? " Essex shrugged . " One can hardly ask , " he said . " Now the proper carving of meat is an art , " Mr. Straus said heavily . " It takes a love of flesh . I 've seen a man carve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and you ca n't tell me that meat made fair eating . " " Drink , brother ? " asked Mrs. Willow . " I have done too well already , ma'am . But yes , another small drop . If you see a man take up a piece of meat with care and fondness like he was lifting a baby , now , that man can carve meat . I remember a fellow  --  married man , of course  --  we used to have in the shop many years ago  --  " Hidden in the rose garden , Julia began to cry drunkenly . " I just do n't know why it 's got to end , " she said . " What 's got to end ? " The youngest Watkins boy handed her a lighted cigarette and laughed . " I never been in here before , "
