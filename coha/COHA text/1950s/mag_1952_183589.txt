Instead of doing a live TV drama just once and then forgetting about it , Broadway TV Theater repeats the same play on five consecutive nights over Manhattan 's station WOR-TV . TV producers like the idea because it saves on sets , actors ' salaries and programming . Actors like it because it gives them a chance to be seen night after night , just as in the theater , and eases the feverish pressures of TV acting . <P> The only imponderable was : Would televiewers like it ? Last week WOR-TV announced the result of a research test by Pulse : Broadway TV Theater , in its first week on the air , drew a rating of 32.3 , higher than that of any other New York TV dramatic show .
