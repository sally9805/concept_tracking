The Navy last week announced contracts to build a radio telescope costing $60 million . The project has two defense purposes : 1 ) the telescope 's enormous dish antenna , over 400 ft. in diameter , can act as a beam transmitter and bounce powerful radio signals off the moon . When they return after 2.6 sec. , they can be received with good freedom from jamming at any place on earth where the moon is in the sky ; 2 ) there is also a worthwhile possibility that the great telescope , which concentrates radio waves as a big optical telescope concentrates light waves , will be able to pick up radio evidence reflected off the moon that somebody on earth has exploded a nuclear device or launched a powerful missile . <P> When the moon is not in the sky , the Navy 's dish will be at the service of peacetime scientists . By bringing information from as much as 6 billion light years away , it may tell the size and age of the universe . It may tell whether the universe exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it is still being created and continues indefinitely in all directions in both time and space .
