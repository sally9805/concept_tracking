 | At Christmastime , your pioneer ancestor had at least one advantage over you . He could shoulder an ax , go to the pine grove in his back yard , and get his own Christmas tree . Because it was freshly cut , his tree would retain its beautiful color , its fragrance , and its needles throughout the holiday season . Today , you 'd probably have to travel miles to reach the nearest wood , and then you 'd find a " No trespassing " sign . Anyway , the chances are you do n't own an ax . So you 'll probably go to your grocery , your filling station , your flower shop , or a roadside stand where some fellow who was n't there yesterday has ventured into the shortlived , boom-or-bust business of selling Christmas trees . But buying a Christmas tree should entail more than a flying trip to the nearest seller . If you want a lovelier , safer tree and a merrier Christmas this year , you should first know the answers to the following questions . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to pay more for a Christmas tree this year than you paid last year . Growers ' prices , cutters ' wages , and freight costs have risen sharply . However , prices are most affected by the number of trees available in any local market . An oversupply of trees can make the prices so low that it does n't pay the owner to take the trees out of the railroad yard . A few years ago , for example , New York and Chicago railroads spent a good deal of money disposing of trees that no one would take for the asking . But last year , in Chicago , a bundle of trees that cost a dealer $3.50 brought him over $20 ? and that 's only normal markup in the risky business of selling Christmas trees . This year , general signs indicate that fewer Christmas trees will be available than last year . There probably will not be an actual shortage , but the supply may not be sufficient to make prices fall . So keep an eye on your local supply . Note especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so this year ; that might indicate a shortage . Should I buy early or late ? Early buyers get the best selection of trees . If the market is glutted , however , late buyers may get huge bargains ; obviously , nothing is worth less than an unsold tree on Christmas afternoon . Some people buy at the last minute because they believe their tree will be fresher ; but there is no reason to assume that a tree bought later was cut later . A tree that reaches the market the day before Christmas may have been cut two months before and shipped from a forest more than a thousand miles away . If you live in an apartment , there is good reason to buy a tree late : storing it in a warm room dries it out , causes it to lose color and needles , and makes it a greater fire hazard . However , if you can care for a tree properly , you can keep it in better condition than a dealer will . What size tree should I buy ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | buy until you know where you 're going to put it . Big trees cost more , and if you 've ever tried to whittle one down , you know it 's a difficult job . So choose your spot before you choose your tree . It is n't always wise to buy the tallest tree your purse and ceiling height will allow . First , fire-prevention experts recommend a smaller tree . Second , a small tree with plenty of ornaments is prettier than a tall one on which ornaments seem sparse . Finally , consider your floor space as well as your ceiling height . Unless a tall tree has a wide spread at the base , it is n't very graceful ; yet when lower branches extend too far into the room , they can be a nuisance . Measure the number of feet you can spare for the spread of the lowest branches ; the height of your tree should be about twice that . Where should I place the tree ? A big point to consider is safety . A Christmas tree can ignite from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen seconds . Here are some basic rules : 1 . Never set the tree next to an open fireplace . The fire 's heat will dry out the tree ; a spark from the fire may cause trouble . 2 . Do n't place the tree near a radiator unless you can keep the radiator shut off . A tree stays fresh longer in the coolest part of the room . 3 . Keep the tree away from the room 's most frequented parts , particularly doorways . 4 . Set the tree a short distance from a switch or outlet . What kind of tree is best ? Fir trees , especially the Douglas fir , are generally considered the best American Christmas trees . They have close-set branches , a sturdy center stem to support the top ornament , and soft , flat needles growing singly along the branches . The Douglas fir ( also called Oregon pine ) holds its needles longer than other firs , and has the unique advantage of nonsticky boughs . The spruce is another widely popular Christmas tree , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pine is often used . The highly prized and heavily needled double balsam fir , grown in eastern Canada , is sometimes shipped as far as Florida and Texas ; Douglas firs from Montana , where Christmas-tree raising is an important business , may turn up anywhere . However , the kind of tree you buy is likely to depend on where you live , and almost any kind of evergreen makes a satisfactory Christmas tree if you know how to select a good one and how to take care of it . How should I select a tree ? First , of course , untie the tree and spread its branches . Your eye will tell you whether it has a pleasing shape . The ideal tree 's branches are evenly and not too widely spaced along a straight , sturdy center stem . All boughs at about the same height are about the same length . The tree tapers gracefully from a single , not too long tip , and the spread of the bottom branches is at least forty percent of the tree 's height . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This , however , is perfection . You might comb an entire forest without finding a single perfect specimen . A narrower tree , while not so grace ful , may better fit the space you 've chosen for it . If the boughs are a bit short and scanty on one side of the tree , this may not show at all if you set the tree in a corner . However , make sure the tree you choose has none of the more troublesome defects . Check the following points : Top spike ( called the leader ) . It should be long and strong enough to hold the top ornament . Avoid a short , crooked , or multiple tip . Center stem . Do n't accept a forked or noticeably crooked stem . You 'll have trouble setting up the tree unless the entire stem is straight , strong , and single . Stump ( called the handle ) . On a six-foot tree , the stump must extend at least six inches below the lowest branches ; on taller trees , add an inch for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away lower branches in order to get your tree into a stand . Branches . They should not be too widely spaced there should be no noticeable gaps anywhere along the trunk ; no single branches should extend too far Foliage . Shake the tree gently and observe amount of needlefall . Look for browned , dried-out , and very loose needles and mangy bare patches . They are not only ugly ; they are a sign that the tree is no longer fresh and is thus a greater fire hazard . How should I care for the tree before setting it up ? A dried-out tree is dangerous and rapidly loses its beauty . Three things speed drying out : heat . wind , lack of water . Follow these rules to keep a tree fresh and healthy until you are ready to set it up . 1 . Set it in a pail of water . A tree absorbs moisture better if you first cut , at a sharp angle , an inch off the stump , in order to expose the maximum " drinking " surface . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . If you leave it outdoors , shelter it from the wind . An unheated garage is an ideal spot . If the weather is n't below freezing , a tree will thrive outdoors in rain or snow , so long as it is not exposed too much wind . But if you 've left it out in the snow , remember to bring it inside early enough to prevent its thawing on the living-room rug . How should I set up the tree ? Indoor heat , plus the heat of Christmas-tree lights , plus the passing of each additional day , inevitably dries out a tree ; but you can keep yours fresher , greener , and far less of a fire hazard if you set it in a stand that contains water . You can buy such a stand , or you can make one out of a five-gallon paint pail . ( A smaller pail might be adequate for a small tree , @#  | but the larger size holds a tree steadier . Cut a wooden cover to fit snugiy into the top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for the tree stump . Place bricks or stones in the bottom of the pail , leaving enough space in the center for the tree stump , to provide weight and help hold the tree upright . Fill the pail with water , and keep it filled above the level of the bias cut as long as the tree remains in the house . It was once believed that adding ammonium sulfate to the water lessened flammability , but tests by Underwriters ' Laboratories showed this had the reverse effect . Plain water is all you need . However , Christmas-tree expert Willis Clark . who buys as many as 200,000 Canadian trees a year , offers this hint : To each qua'rt of water , add a cup of sugar or molasses . Perhaps the tree has a sweet tooth ; perhaps the sweetening helps create new sap , as Clark suggests . Friends to whom he has confided this tip say that their trees never before stayed so fresh and green . What safety measures should I take ?

Bending the were may have cracked the insulation and broken the inside copper just enough to loose a tiny spark . ( For a full story on Christmas-tree lights , see " Henry Taylor 's Corner , " page 34 . ) Beauty plus safety can be achieved by decorating a tree with reflector-type ornaments , then floodlighting the tree with spotlight or camera-light equipment placed at a safe distance . Do n't run electric trains around the tree base . Remove gift wrappings from the tree as soon as possible . Make the tree corner out of bounds for smokers . Watch the tree carefully . Keep the stand filled with water , of course . Do n't let the lights burn too long at a stretch . Examine the needles daily . If they 're turning brown near the tree lights , move the lights . If they 're turning brown everywhere and shedding heavily , take the tree down immediately or as soon as possible . How should I dispose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house . There 's no fireplace big enough to safely contain the fire from even a comparatively small tree . Even if the flames do n't leap out , the terrific heat created by the furious combustion of the resinloaded tree may ignite nearby woodwork , curtains , or anything that is n't virtually fireproof . Even outdoors , a tree should be burned only as a dramatic object lesson ; the spectacle of a burning Christmas tree should convince anyone that it pays to handle it with care . And do just that : set the tree in a well-cleared space , stand upwind , drop your match , and step back fast . The safest disposal method is to have your trash or garbage collector take the tree away .
