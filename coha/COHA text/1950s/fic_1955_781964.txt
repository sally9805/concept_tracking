 | But Morissa Kirk only turned her head from the rancher , her soft bangs tossing a little on the wind . She did not trust her voice or its certain betrayal of her anger . When the long wagons of mine machinery and equipment started to come up , she watched Robin climb over his green fills to see how they held up under the heavy wheels and the clumsy sideslip of the extended running gears . He had reinforced the abutment with crisscross willow mats and chunks of sandrock scattered like nuts in a coarse pudding , but the scrapers had not finished until long after sunup . Morissa noticed some men , probably the Pennsylvanians , walking behind a wagon that separated from the crowd south of the river and moved to a little rise . Then for a while the bright sun glinted on working shovels , and afterward they turned around and joined the long string of the waiting . When they passed up the trail they were sitting stiffly on the boards laid across the wagon , dark as dusty crows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant recognition to Morissa and brought the determination of anger to her once more . As though there had been no silence between them , Tris spoke apologetically of the reception the doctor had received from the men , particularly after one of his cowboys took her there . " You would strike many rough spots like that here , Miss Morissa , " he said , slipping into the first name without noticing it . " But with the bridge about done , Robin will be pulling out soon , and you 'll be gone ? " He left it open , his voice trailing off . The girl knew the storm-gray eyes were intent upon her and felt a foolish warmth creep into her cheeks . " I have n't heard Robin 's plans yet , he 's been so busy , " she evaded , recalling , in her Scottish heart , that a crooked answer merits no straight question , as Grandmother Kirk would have said . Iier evasion got a Western reply , silence , and so Morissa occupied herself with the hypnotic movement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge and then whipping away up the trail as though the gold were just over the first rise . She thought of the other hopeful trails once through this valley . The Mormons had fled persecution up the north bank here , almost at Cimarron 's impatient feet . On the other side of the river , up past Chimney Rock and Scotts Bluff standing against the western horizon was the rutted trail of the Overlanders , those who were tolled West by earlier dreams of gold , and the homeseekers on the way to Oregon and the rolling western seas . But now much of the south river bottoms was closed to every passing wheel or hoof , although it was all free land , public domain . Robin had told her about the Coad brothers , with ranch buildings at the foot of  | Scotts Bluff . They had wired the gap between the bluff and the Wild Cat range to the south of it , and all the passes through the Wild Cats , clown the twenty miles to Chimney Rock , that curious needle that pricked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only opening the eastern one between the Chimney and the river , and that they closed even tighter by gun-packing line riders ready to shoot . Coad 's Kingdom , Robin called it , and no man could enter . Nobody camped up there even in this crowded time except their own beef herds and freight outfits . One of Tris 's cowboys interrupted Morissa 's thoughts . He came from the beef camp with a can of coffee , tin cups , and a hot raisin pie in a dutch oven that he carried carefully in a gunny sack . They spread their slickers and made a little picnic of it there on the knoll beside a patch of wild yellow sweetpeas , their fragrance so heavy that the butterflies clung dizzily to the glowing spikes of bloom . " I guess I let my mind fly off with the geese there a while ? " Morissa apologized . " I was thinking about the emigrants who used to come up the trails along the river , and the valley off west . " " You certainly can quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ruefully . " Do you like what you see around here ? " " Oh , I do ! " Morissa replied , speaking with the enthusiasm and sudden identity of the homeseeker in a new region . " Robin told me last winter that all the time he worked on the U.P . grade out to Utah he felt that they missed the finest region , the one with the most promise ? the North Platte valley . " " Well , there is better grass than this along the Platte here , Miss Morissa , and for water you do n't need a river so big you can scarcely swim it for months hand running . " " But look at the crops that will grow here . " " Crops ! A city young lady like you thinking about crops ? ! Even the grass burns up clear to the bogs here in July . Not enough rain . " " Not enough rain with all the water running past ? Irrigate ! " But this the rancher beside her seemed not to hear . Instead he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of a river swallow , and talked about getting up a big picnic . " You ca n't leave us here without seeing the valley from the top of Scotts Bluff . A rep from u British financial syndicate 's around , looking for a ranch . He brought his new wife , a London actress , and a whole spread of house men and maids . I 'd like to get up a picnic for them on the bluff , if you 'll come . " " It sounds fine , " Morissa said , " but you know there 's always a chance that I 'll be called away the last minute . A doctor ca n't be too definite in her promises ? " " A doctor ? ? How about the woman ? " Tris Polk asked , his eyes  | searching the girl 's flushed face until she wanted to shout a defense against him , cry out the pain and hurt the woman had endured for being a woman , but she was silent . It was well Morissa had her little black bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tooth to be pulled , the jaw fat and shining , and then injuries and dosings , one after another , until she was so weary she was relieved when Robin signaled to them . Their horses prancing side by side , Morissa and Tris Polk fell in behind the down stagecoach coming in from Deadwood , a couple of arrows still sticking in the side , sent after the coach as it passed a small party of Indians just below the agency . Toward sundown Jackie rode in from the horse herds . He had seen no Indians but was full of excitement over his sister 's visit here , and over the live young antelope he brought rolled in a gunny sack and tied across the back of his saddle like a slicker , hoofs hanging down on one side , big-eared head on the other . The soft brown eyes were glazed with terror but the trembling nose reached out to sniff at Morissa 's hand , the tongue eagerly sucking at her little finger . " Oh dear , starving ! But what will we feed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk 's better , the men tell me , " Jackie said matter-of-factly as he slid his long length from the saddle . Morissa saw with joy how much he looked like their slight , earnest-faced mother , almost as though she lived again in the bearding youth , and yet how much like Robin he was in the strength of his body , and in his quiet manner . Avoiding the kiss Morissa might have given him , he grinned , untied the antelope and set it down , to stagger stiffly around them and the horse , the shy , lovely head reaching out , the tongue searching . Before Jackie came into the soddy he rode off for one of the wet mares in the grader herd and brought her and the colt into the corral . With the sun slanting between low thunderheads over him he milked enough for one of the nippled bottles from Morissa 's emergency case , and together they taught the baby antelope to drink . That night the little creature slept inside because there was lightning in the west and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud at the idea . " Oh , Sis ! They always stay out ? " " But he might wander off , with those dogs around Etty 's , and still so much commotion around , " Morissa insisted . That was true . Although thousands had passed over the bridge , the planks rumbled with hoof and wheel far into the moonlight , the slow bull trains plodding over to camp with at least that much of a start in the morning . Some said that Clarke took in twenty thousand dollars this one afternoon . Morissa believed it  --  and all from a bridge that had cost him nothing beyond his effort , his time , and his faith for almost two  | years . The material and labor were donated or paid for by the railroads and the businessmen of Sidney , Omaha and points east . There was one certainty : None of the money came from the upper Missouri river towns or from Cheyenne , all competitors of the Sidney-Black Hills gold trail . By now the side of the bridge was clear in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , buried beside the one from the Pennsylvania party , who had died with his boots on too  --  both at peace . Anxious to shake off such thoughts , Morissa went out for a last look at her patient in the wagon . He was almost as pale and weak as when she first pumped air into his reviving lungs yesterday . The young doctor hated to admit this , for without Reeder her work here did n't add up to much . One patient was lost by default , beyond all help except the easing of pain , even if she had been permitted to touch him . She had sewed back an ear half torn off in a wailer fight , lanced two carbuncles , pulled the rotten bicuspid , dressed one crushed hand and one mule-tromped foot , quieted a running drunk , revived three fainters overcome by the crush and excitement , doled out salts , calomel , and itch ointment , and a tin of crab salve . A woman came for the salve and the young doctor measured it out with her customary gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plotted , perhaps , by the pretty , boyish youth over at the breed 's store , the boy called Eddie Ellis . Yet when she looked at the woman more closely Morissa had decided it was no joke . And now it was night , with lightning in the west flickering swift as the eye 's blink . In the bowed wagon Morissa stooped to look down at Tom Reeder , awake , his face anxious , his pulse like a feeble watch deep under cotton wool . " You ai n't gon na ship me out ? " he said slowly , his pale eyes deeppupiled from the darkness . Yes , Sidney would be better , and he could be taken to Omaha by train if necessary , to a good hospital . " You ca n't go do that to a man , ma'am , " he murmured weakly , as though talking in a half dream . Here in her father 's wire corral , with everybody knowing the gold was n't on him , he felt safer . Outside " I am a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's just it , " the doctor finally answered . " You are very sick and not improving . I ca n't even feed you right . " But he did feel stronger already , he pleaded . It was always expecting to be robbed , filled full of holes any minute , that wore a man down . He had made a strike up to Alder Gulch in Montana , ten years back , and sold out for twenty thousand , then was creased alongside the head by a bullet out of a brush patch , robbed and left for dead . Last year he was cleaned out again by the big break in silver at Virginia City over in  | Nevada , when Comstock himself lost maybe forty-two millions in a week . That was n't done with no gun but he was just as busted . This time he planned to fix it so 's nobody 'd know . He went in rags around Deadwood Gulch , wore gunny sacks and wire for shoes in thirty-five below zero , and lived on the rent of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robber sitting on a stump , and talking poor-mouth just as loud . Lucky his claim looked bad , out in a bare pocket of rock with no timber around to cover any snoopers come to stick a dirty nose into his panning , for the pocket had trapped a lot of nuggets amongst the gravel . He took out a whole palmful the morning of his strike , shining like a girl 's pretties in the sun . He covered the strike over fast with his old blankets and shoveled his placer dumps on top . Every clay he scooped out a few pans from underneath , all winter and spring when it was n't frozen too hard , until the pocket played out , stripped clear down to bedrock . " It took a lot of ponderin ' , with claim jumpers and holdups thick as buzzards around a buffalo kill , " he said , looking up at the girl in the lantern light . By then he had been feeling so poorly he could n't straighten up , and on top of everything that pain had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole with a gnawin ' like a mouse . He was afraid of the doctors at Deadwood ; paying them with gold would give him away , and then there was that talking gas and ether they used on a man . Finally got so he could n't keep anything on his stomach any more , and a chance come to hitch in with Pratt 's freight outfit and some a them Sunday miners leaving the Hills . Altogether they were too strong for most roadagents but there were a dozen men right in the outfit as would cut a man 's throat for a pinch of color . So he could n't wait for the bridge to open , not with thieves sneaking around his wagon of nights , and his stomach too bad for fried side meat and pan bread . " Well , I do n't know about Alder Gulch or the silver , " Morissa admitted , " but I know you have gold here , enough to keep you all your life , if you get it to a bank . " Slowly the man turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck with banks . They folded up on me back in ' 57 . I 'll leave my stuff right in that little box over to the stage station , " he said , and Morissa could n't remind him that even Clarke 's place was not invulnerable now that the outlaws were using dynamite to make way for their Winchesters . " Try to rest tonight and do n't forget that it 's the fox with the sly nose that puts his foot in the trap ? " the young doctor said gaily . When she was back in the soddy she took down Robin 's gun belt from the peg and looked at it a long , long time in her lap , touching the pistol grip cautiously , drawing the gun from the holster out upon her knee .  | She was sitting like that when Robin and Jackie passed on their way to their bunks . " That 's a fine new Peacemaker you got there , " the boy said , and together they showed Morissa something of the gun 's working . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Robin admitted . " Tomorrow Jack 'll show you the fine points of pistoleering . " Now for the first time the girl looked up , surprised that a sixteen-yearold should know anything about the gunman 's craft . Seen this way , Robin 's concern that jack was being drawn to the professional killer did not seem absurd at all . But the target shooting had to be put off , for later in the night it began to sprinkle . Slowly , grayly , the rain fell , on and off , for almost a week . At the bridge the hoofs and wheels passed steadily , the rumble subdued as water softened the planks . But almost everything else stopped , the cleanup around the bridge and the camp , even the beef herds that should be heading north to the Indians or the Hills . Morissa was glad to have her family together this little time , particularly now , with the clouds running in gloomy windrows against the Wild Cat Mountains whenever the rain lifted enough to see . The soaked ground gave Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs Clarke wanted finished up along the trail north . Morissa tried to get reacquainted with the young stranger who was her half-brother , but usually he was over talking to his friend Eddie Ellis clerking at the bridge . When she could she sloshed along the bottoms in gum boots with Jackie , taking up willow and cottonwood seedlings to plant around Robin 's soddy . " Temporary-like ? " the boy asked slyly . " People been asking , like that Gilda Ross who maybe 's got an eye on Polk . " " Well , if I 'm temporary , I hope the trees will last ? " Morissa replied , as she selected another new-leafed whip of cottonwood for Jackie 's spade and then watched a couple of antelope coming down a little spring draw north of the river . Back at the soddy they met Robin riding in from the stage station , with a roll of mail , mostly the Sidney and Omaha papers and a couple of medical catalogues . He riffled through them . " Here 's something for you ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only when he had said it , and saw her look , like a sun 's ray striking Chimney Rock and gone as swiftly did he realize what he had done . When the rain came down too hard the three worked inside the soddy , padding the tops of the nail kegs with worn soogans covered with pieces of old buffalo robe . Morissa and Jackie put up shelves all around under the roof , boards laid on stakes driven into the sod wall , while Robin carved out the DR . KIRK in Morissa 's window sign , and added a  | little staff twined with the double serpent for decoration . " Folks will go to thinking you 're a sure-nuff snake doctor , with that caduceus ? " he laughed . The rain did n't stop men from riding up for a word with Robin or Jack . Eddie Ellis came too , and turned out to be as bold-eyed here as at Etty 's or Clarke 's , wherever he was needed . He was only around the bridge until the rush was done and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian agent up at Red Cloud . He still talked big of making a gold strike . Generally the visitors refused to sit down , apologetic about their hats and slickers that dripped dark patches on the dirt floor , but some stayed for a cup of coffee and a sniff of the haunch of venison Robin had brought in for a slow pot roast with wild garlic , or a boil with noodles in the old army kettle . They talked a little , but mostly they came to sneak glances at the new lady doe , who seemed like any girl , only not flirtylike , one of the men told Jack . " She  --  your sis , she do n't go makin ' eyes under them bangs like most good lookers would ? " meaning most of those he had seen . " Oh , I do n't know , " Robin teased when Jack told this before his blushing sister . " Seems to me she 's got that rancher , Polk , hangin ' around pretty close ? " " He wo n't be for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Morissa replied hotly and went out to look at her patient , feeling very childish and ashamed . The first day of rain three Indian families came through on their way down to their relatives in Indian Territory , where they hoped there might be more to eat than at Red Cloud Agency up the trail there a ways . One of the children was very sick and old Etty came riding over with the father , a tall , silent Indian , to ask the doctor to come very quickly . " He say it is the disease of the little red spots and the son will die like his mother if you will not come ? But there is nothing for pay . " Morissa hurried her essentials together and rode out , the rain loud on her slicker as the squeeging hoofs of the horses splattered mud . She stooped under the tipi flap into the duskiness around a handful of red coals , the baby on a ragged blanket beside the fire , unmoving , burning with fever . Morissa had never been closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness and the brown skin , it was only the smell and the degree of collapse that told her the father 's diagnosis was correct  --  a severe case of measles , with , from the chest indications , serious complications . There was little that Morissa could do except work on the fever and hope to get a little strength into the small boy . She administered a febrifuge , oiled the poor withered skin , sponged the child with cool  | water and then rolled him in a moist towel . Now and then she tried to get the boy to swallow a little warm mare 's milk taken from the antelope 's ration , or a little skimmed venison broth with the rice strained out . And while she watched and worked , sitting awkwardly on the ground , an old Indian woman was squatting on the other side of the fire hole , wailing her mournful medicine songs , the black eyes hot and angry upon the white doctor , the firelight flashing on the long butcher knife at her waist as she swayed . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child seemed a little easier , and so Morissa went home but returned several times during the day and for most of the night . By the second morning the small boy slept , the skin less like a piece of weathered old rabbit leather , and two days later he was hungry . Before the sky cleared the Indians moved , their tipi poles dragging the mud behind the horses . But the boy 's father stayed back , looking after them , and then he and Etty rode over to Morissa 's soddy . Slowly the Indian dismounted and tied his oddly spotted gray horse to the corral fence . There , through old Etty , he made a little talk : " The white man has taken our land , our homes , our buffalo , and given us only hunger and the sicknesses to kill our people . But you are not like these others . You are a healing woman . You have given me back my son ? . " Then he drew his blanket from the horse and , with it folded over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protests that he must not do this , old Etty unheeding , too , riding his shaggy pony at the moccasins of the father . Morissa looked after the Indians with the sadness deep within her laid bare by their need , their dignified and desperate gratitude . In a little while they would be gone , as so many who were here would be , never remaining long enough to be anything of themselves to anyone , certainly not to Morissa Kirk . But that was true of the doctor anywhere . Before an hour passed , a dozen men had ridden over to look at the doctor 's new horse , with the spotted hindquarters that were like a light brocaded drapery thrown over him , the tail thin , the eyes light , and the head magnificent as from an old Grecian frieze . " An Appaloosa , and a damn good one , " they said . " That horse is one of the finest of the breed developed by the Nez Paces up north , " Robin agreed . " He will carry you a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we 'll have to teach him to let you mount on the white man side , not the Indian with a bow in the hand . And to stand with the reins down , so you wo n't be left if there 's no hitchin ' post . " Tris Polk rode in through the rain and was as complimentary . " A finelooking  | twosome you 'll make when you get that horse fed up and curried a little , " he said , as he looked at the tall , straight girl in Jackie 's slicker , her sun-tanning skin tawny and glowing . " I have a silver-mounted sidesaddle back in Texas , ordered as a gift for Empress Carlotta of Mexico from a Texas saddler . It was never delivered because the revolution came and she never got back . Ride it for me on the Appaloosa in the Walker horse show they 're planning . With your green habit and that horse  --  Carlotta 's court could have seen nothing finer . " The young doctor smiled to this , thanking the man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin moved his scraper-horny hands uneasily as he watched , and if he thought of Allston Hoyt and the unworn wedding dress he gave no notice of it . As soon as Robin Thomas was finished with the work up the trail he was taking his grading outfit east to a new railroad line heading out towards the Black Hills , but still many years away . " We 'll be living in tents and shacks , far ahead of settlements , " he told Morissa . " Maybe we 'll have a boxcar now and then , but nothing much for doctoring , unless you find a place you like and settle to wait for it to grow . " " Oh , I guess right here is as good as any , " Morissa said as she mulled up a little ointment in the mortar in her lap . " But we 'll both be gone ? " Yes , she understood that , but she would stay as long as she could , or a doctor was needed . She had decided she would like to file on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north side ; take in that lone cottonwood where the antelope come down . " Oh , Clarke will probably have that covered by a filing , " Robin said , a little relieved . " He 's expecting a town when the railroad comes through . " Morissa tossed her head like a colt smelling the first snow in the air , her motion lifting the darkish bangs from her forehead that was still white above her tanning , reddened cheeks . " I diagnosed that much from what I 've been hearing , from Tris Polk and the rest , " she said . " But they must know that the railroad will bring the settlers thick as ants to a sorghum boiling . " " That wo n't happen here for years ? " " Maybe Mr. Clarke does n't think it will be years . At least I do n't . I have to have patients . In the meantime I 'll file on the best place I can get near the bridge and the trail , but that little creek and the draw where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to irrigate a garden patch . " " Oh , I could n't advise that , Morissa , " the father said soberly , pretending to be concerned with the draft of his pipestem . " There 'll be trouble if you grow garden truck here for the homeseekers to see , even a shirttail  | patch . The ranchers have killers on the payroll , to keep the range clear . One of the men working for the government surveyor sent over north of the river to put down section corners was hung by the Boslers , dust for a hint . " But Morissa was not listening . " Maybe I 'll take up a tree claim too , i owning along the north and west of the homestead for winter shelter , " she added . " Oh , Daughter ! " Robin protested . " I can understand your shrinking back , hiding yourself , particularly just now , with not even a letter , but your plan here is suicidal . " " Suicidal ? " the young woman repeated after him , but as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone slack in her lap on each side of the old mortar , her face suddenly blighted , and once more Robin thought of the day he stood behind her mother as she told the twelveyear-old Morissa that the girl 's poor-farm days were done forever . There had been no joy in the young face , only a frozen standing away from them both , as though she could not choose the good , as though it could not be for her , was somehow not fitting . iv AND THEN THE LETTER CAME . IT WAS AFTER THE LAST OF THOSE waiting for the bridge were gone north , and most of those who had catered to them  --  the whisky and woman tents and wagons , and the professional gamblers except Johnson and his big blonde with an eye for Tris Polk . Although there was always a crowd of night campers at the bridge , enough to crowd Clarke 's and Etty 's , Morissa found the evenings long , with no one except Tom Reeder in the wagon out there . Sometimes the loneliness was sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushing in like the shadows of the lantern on the dirt floor and the rooty sod walls . Only the red calico curtains and the cut-glass scent bottles seemed of a woman 's life . Morissa received the letter from the hand of young Eddie Ellis , coming to bring it to her from the stage station . She accepted it as for a stranger and then went slowly along the weeding bottoms to the shade of her soddy . There she sat on her nail-keg stool among the flourishing young willows and cottonwoods , with the spreading young portulacas blooming about her feet . She laid the letter on her knee , the rectangle  | creamy white against the dark blue of her skirt , the address bold in black broadstroke . At last she had to open it . There was one paragraph : My Dearest : I was pained and grieved by your inconsiderate disappearance , and it took me some days to discover your probable hiding place , which I abstracted from the Omaha offices of Henry Clarke , Esq . Come back , Morissa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shadowed parentage distresses my family beyond reconciliation , but I assure you that the unhappy circumstance of the gap between our stations need be no obstacle to our love . As ever , ob'd'tly , Allston Her eyes ran over it again , selecting the words she would see : " ? no obstacle to our love . " The broad ink strokes seemed to lift themselves from the paper , and she could not hold back the tears . She would fly to her trunk , pack it swiftly , perhaps in time to catch the down coach for Sidney today . But then she had to consider the sentence more carefully , all of it , the part that spoke of bridging " the gap between our stations " too . So there was a gap to be bridged . And nowhere was there any mention of marriage or a return of his mother 's ring to her hand . Slowly Morissa looked back over the life that had made the gap , back to her earliest recollection of waiting for her young mother to return from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later when the mother sickened , Morissa was put out with a dozen other children at an unhappy sort of poor-farm , but Lorna Kirk , barely twenty-one , could not face putting her five-year-old into a foundling home for adoption . And at the little Missouri crossroads school the shameful term " woods colt " was spoken openly before Issy , Morissa , the meaning of the phrase eagerly explained to her in words from which the girl could only flee into work . At school she learned envy , too , particularly of one pupil who was never called by a nickname or anything less than her whole name : Martha Jane . It was said that her mother was not one to soil her white hands with work . Instead she rode the Princeton region on a fine Kentucky mare and spent the money her husband 's family sent willingly so long as the youngest son kept his wife far away , out of sight of God-fearing people . But even if this was true , and Mrs. Canary really had come from a water-front dive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martha Jane could speak out Morissa 's shame boldly before all the school . Shaking back the curls from her pert , pretty face , and smoothening the wine-colored velvet of her dress she sang the words :  | Issy over the ocean , Issy over the sea , Issy 's a bastard kid , She ca n't catch me . One , two , three skipping her red-handled rope to its beat . But as soon as Martha Jane 's breasts began to push at her velvet bodice she followed her mother to the gay young soldiers , gayer because they might soon be dead , whether from Johnny Reb or a bushwhacker . After that their two good saddlers were often tied to the hitchracks at Princeton , and on the shady hotel piazza the mother and her precocious twelve-year-old flirted with drummers and spies , anyone with flash and gold . Or they could be seen flying over the country roads in fast rigs while the meek husband cared for the younger children at home . All this time Morissa was at the poor-farm . She helped milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school barefoot , with a chunk of cornbread and sorghum wrapped in newspaper or in cornshucks when the paper failed . Then the pale , sickened Lorna Kirk married Robin Thomas , a road worker , a grader . He bedded her down comfortably in his covered wagon and took her West . Four hens rode in the straw of his scraper tied beneath the wagon , and a milk cow followed at the tailboard . In this way they would have the eggs and milk Robin believed his wife must have to live . But it was a precarious venture , with little hope of work , and so Morissa had to be left behind . During this lonesome , deserted time she withdrew deeper into work ; in the late evenings that were her own she lost herself in her school books and in dreaming over the letters that came back , telling of a lovely wild country , and later of the worrisome time before a brother was born , and then the slow gathering of strength , until one day they were back , her own mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the four-year-old Jackie clinging to his trouser leg . At first Morissa dared not trust their words , feeling unfit for the new family , but after a few days she put on the new shoes they brought her and went with them , slowly believing the kindness that could lie in the calloused hands of this sunburnt man as he cared for his ailing wife , and the prideful look that could live in his eyes as he considered his family . " You must get some schooling , " he had told the girl . " Good steel rusts a lot faster than old stove iron if it ai n't used . " But he could n't help much with all her mother 's illness . Morissa managed to pass the teachers examination and at fifteen she was teaching a nearby school , with boys who towered over her using Martha  | Jane 's taunts against her . Hurt , and proud , she turned her back on her first beau without explanation or more than secret tears . She studied , and saved every penny because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gnawed at her mother 's breast so many years . But Lorna Kirk could not wait , and after the funeral Robin helped her serious , big-eyed daughter get to Philadelphia . There she won her medical degree and then went back farther west to set up a little practice , out near Omaha , and to leave the words of Martha Jane behind her forever . She met Allston Hoyt by answering an emergency call to a by-road and found him on the ground beside his scattered and broken buggy , apparently dying from a runaway of his flashy roadsters . She stemmed the flow of blood there , kept the man warm and alive until his coachman came with the ambulance . Afterward , at the big white house high above the river , she directed the nursing and told him that he must now always be careful . It was a heart attack that had brought on the runaway , she thought ; his own failing hand on the stern lines over his fiery matched blacks . But even after he went back to his office he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of her Scottish grandmother 's saying : " A cold needs a cook fully as much as a doctor ? " and the heart a serene brow more than the chemist 's potions . A serene brow ? For that sudden prescription he would need discipline , Allston Hoyt argued . He was still a young man , barely forty in spite of the silvery touches at his temples . He must be taught how to live . " Do n't worry too much , " Morissa finally told him . " Heart patients who do n't die of the first attack have a way of burying most of their friends and relatives ? " making this vigorous to cover her own growing concern for him , and for herself . But he kept calling her to him at the pillared house on the rise above the Missouri until it became a joke between them . Then one afternoon he led her out upon the terrace overlooking the river , the bottoms golden in cottonwoods , the maples and oaks reddening against the bluffs . He talked a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to take over the family 's investment firm because his father , too , suffered from a heart condition . The panic of the fifties ended and he went West to recoup their fortune in the boom that followed the transcontinental railroad , and he had built up the business in spite of war and the crash of Black Friday . Then this illness struck at him on a side road , before there had been time to live , to be a human being . And now in his first leisure , no , idleness , he had fallen in love , wholly in love with his doctor . " ? Come with me . I 'll take you to Scotland on our honeymoon .  | We 'll look up your grandmother 's people and perhaps locate some of mine , " he urged , and his brown eyes were very dark against the pallor of his sudden emotion . It was then that Morissa should have spoken , but she was suddenly like a spring hillside in sun-shot rain , with such a softness , such a glistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left she walked in the western wind that trembled the fall leaves , and on her finger was the fine old diamond that had belonged to Allston Hoyt 's mother . The plans went well and pleasantly all the winter , although Morissa would not give up her practice and still made the rounds of the river bottom shacks , where smallpox and diphtheria were like the Plague of London . Robin could n't come home from the bridge grading for the formal post-Easter announcement dinner at the Western Empire Hotel , but he wrote he would certainly be there to judge her May trousseau , largely purchased with his money . Then suddenly Allston 's sister had sent the coach for Morissa . The fragilely elegant woman poured her a cup of tea in her handsome green parlor , with the long , white-dressed windows and the pale gold upholstery . Speaking calmly , objectively , Alicia Hoyt asked Morissa her father 's name , and when the girl replied that it was Robin Ralston Thomas , the woman shook her head gently . " My dear , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to remember all she had hoped was forgotten in her busy life  --  the unhappiness of her child-mother , the taunts at school and later in her own classroom . " My hobby is genealogy , " the woman explained . " Allston wanted to make you a gift of your family tree to carry along to Scotland , as a guide in your travels to your ancestral seat . Despite much careful search I can find only one use of the name Kirk by your mother  --  Miss Lorna Kirk ? up to her marriage to Robin Thomas . " So it was done , swift as a surgeon 's knife , and , given such circum-stances , it was the kindest way , Morissa realized . She could have said that Robin Thomas knew all this and yet married her mother , and tirade a beloved daughter of the bastard child . But a railroad grader , no matter how fine and good , was not an Allston or a Hoyt . As she rose to go Alicia offered her the jeweled bottle of smelling salts from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my expressions of sympathy . Dear Allston is prostrated , and thought this would be kinder , coming from one of your own sex ? " Morissa thanked the woman and went away . Dismissing the coach man outside of the grounds , she walked the five-mile distance toward the city , walked it along the bluffs of the Missouri and saw nothing at all about her , not the swift spring that ran in new grass along the rutted  | road , or the pale cloudy green of the wooded river valley below , nor the boats and barges that worked their way slowly up the gray flood and were passed so gaily by the down-bent craft . She saw nothing at all until suddenly a broken-backed bullsnake struggled to drag its useless length out of the rut at her feet . Morissa Kirk looked down at the injured creature and with the swift blow of a rock she flattened the head , and then with two sticks she rolled the twisting length off into the grass , where the dumb writhing could wear out its necessity in the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only long enough to pick up her pill bag and went down through the river bottom shacks , seeing to their needs for one last time . In two days she was on her way West , to Robin and Jackie and the North Platte valley where no one asked a man 's origins or his past , no more than the " What name you travelin ' under ? " she had often heard since . And now there was this letter from Allston Hoyt , thick creamy paper lying on her knee . But almost as though from her memory of the crippled creature in the road that day , a call of " Snake ! Snake bite ! " brought Morissa out of herself . A man was spurring up to the soddy and shouting this over and over until he slid from his lathered horse . " They 's bringing a kid what 's been rattlesnake bit ! " Morissa ran around to the door , the letter left to blow forgotten where it slipped from her lap . A heavy work mare was galloping ponderously in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , a child in a pink dress . Close behind him came a woman astride another old mare , bareback , too , whipping the man 's horse along ahead of her and then her own , riding bent forward and whipping , whipping . The young doctor was already inside , reaching for boiled scalpel and knife , for a stimulant . She flipped open the handiest book , her Hartshorne , to " Snake bite , " and slapped a pane of glass over it , angry that she was so inexperienced in this situation . She had never even seen a case of rattlesnake bite , and already the child was being carried through her low doorway . The little girl was about six , curiously stiff and awkward , stuporous with the smell of raw alcohol about her . Morissa had her laid on the cot and made a swift examination . One of the legs was hugely swollen below a handkerchief tourniquet twisted with a wagon bolt , tight enough for gangrene . A big cud of chewing tobacco was tied over the wound above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a drink of corn likker was all they knew , the gaunt woman sobbed . " How much corn liquor ? " Morissa asked . Even Hartshorne seemed doubtful about whisky , but he had nothing much to offer , particularly this long after the biting . " All the corn we had , about half a cup ? " The doctor 's lips tightened . " Make coffee , " she ordered the woman ,  | and tried to give the child a small tablet . But she could not swallow , so Morissa loosened the tourniquet a little and slashed into the wound , making it deep and wide , squeezing it . Only black clots and a yellow oozing came , and the doctor ran her slender steel up along the vein as along a fish 's belly , and down into the foot too , clearing out the thickened blood both ways until a weak bleeding started . Then she stood back brushing the hair from her cheeks with her sleeve . There should be something more to do but Morissa Kirk , M.D. , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big was the snake ? " she finally asked . " It was big as my wrist , bigger ? " the woman cried , holding up a brown , work-gnarled arm . But the gesture and her anger were both turned against her husband . " ? Bringin ' a woman and a child to such a country ! " In the morning , while blackbirds sang along the marshy ground , Morissa helped bury the small girl . Most of the night the child had lain quiet and remote , never conscious , and the doctor could n't be certain when the pulse finally died whether it was from alcohol or venom . She brought out a white cashmere shawl that had never been worn and wrapped the child in it . The mother stood dry-eyed with her back against the window , looking with clenched lips down upon the father as he squatted on a nail-keg stool , his head in his hands . " She ai n't even no doll baby to be buried with ! " the mother cried when one of Etty 's men drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed box , but white with drying kalsomine under the ; umful of the sweet-scented golden banner that Fish Head had gathered . Quickly Morissa rolled up a finger towel , tied it tight for the neck and sewed on two shoe buttons for eyes , red yarn for lips , and made a swaddling blanket from a pretty blue handkerchief . Then she tucked it into the child 's arm and folded the corner of the white shawl down over the quiet face . Lorette , old Etty 's breed wife , heavy with child , joined Morissa and the parents as they followed the coffin to the knoll Inside the new mounds of the Pennsylvanian and the hanged man . There Lorette knelt beside the grave , crossing herself within her blanket , perhaps thinking of her own two small ones buried here , while Morissa stood with the gaunt mother and the father and read a little from her white wedding prayer book . Old Fish Head was there too , with his tall hat from the axle-grease bucket held elegantly over his heart , the wind lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . The Curious little antelope had followed very close at first , but now he stood off a ways , big ears erect , looking , with animal instinct remaining aloof from death . Then they went back down in the wagon , silent , the anger between  | the parents something that was cold and dead , the link that had perhaps bound them broken . Morissa hurried to her neglected patient , fed him , gathered up her laundry whipping in the wind behind the soddy since yesterday , and lay down to catch a little belated sleep for the night 's long vigil . She did not wait to see if the parents went back up the trail , still heading on for gold , or if that too was meaningless now . Not until the antelope came to waken her toward evening , nuzzling the doorknob and the screen of the open window , did Morissa recall the letter from Allston Hoyt . Tear-blinded , she looked all through the little house for it , and finally recalled that it had been in her lap outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So she tucked up her skirts and ran all around the house , looking carefully through her young plants , through the little woodpile , among the few wagons left in the grader 's corral , and then all over the bottoms , back and forth , first down the wind and then in carefully widening circles everywhere , even along the edge of the muddy riverbank , the antelope at her heels , bumping her every time she stopped to look . Finally when the late darkness came Morissa went with the lantern to ask at the station if a letter had been picked up , and to the whisky stores and Etty 's Lorette . But no one had seen it . Slowly she returned to the soddy , stopping at the lighted window to look at the cut-out sign : DR . KIRK . Even if she kept on letting children die in her arms , it was plain that there was nothing else ahead for her . Gently she pushed the little antelope away from the door and went inside . There was a tremendous electric storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blazing , jagged bolts , the earth shaking with the roar and crash that knocked bits of sod from between the roof boards to the cot and the floor . Morissa had caught up the young antelope , suddenly shy and wild with his animal foreboding , and now , as the thunder grew , the little creature stood squeezed into a corner , the mild eyes that were turned back toward the lamp and Morissa bleaching with terror at the louder crashes , the sensitive skin shivering . Around one o'clock , when it seemed that the rain must begin at last , more than just the scattering of big drops that rattled like bird-shot against the window , there was a running outside and a shout at the door . It was one of the men from a big herd that came up out of Texas a week ago , the beef steers thin-flanked , with spreading horns and still wild as deer . They had been held up north in the sandhills since then , to fatten a little . Tonight they went crazy in the electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn the stampeding herd . His horse stepped in a badger hole and it looked like Martin 's neck was broke . " But he 's alive ? " " Yeh  --  was when I left . "  | " Oh , I hope nobody tries to move him ! Hurry out to the pasture and get my Appaloosa ? " " I brong you a horse  --  them ' Poolusas is nervous in storms ? " " But yours wo n't be woman-broke ? " " You better get into some a Robin 's work pants , and I fetched you a pair a chaps to hold off the rain , ' n spurs . This ai n't the night for no lady sidesaddlin ' ? " So Morissa slipped into Jackie 's levis , recalling the first time she saw Sid Martin , on the stagecoach that brought her up from Sidney . With her medical bag and some extras rolled in an oilskin behind the saddle , and with her slicker buckled high , they started into the rain turned to silver sheets by the lightning until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode astride , as she had the work mares of the poor-farm in her childhood , for a hundred times the horses plunged over banks , slipped , stumbled into badger and prairie-dog holes , or side-jumped as some wild thing flushed before them . A hundred times Morissa would have been off if she were riding sidesaddle . But the man ahead kept spurring on , while the young doctor steadied the jump of her medical case with an anxious hand . Then it began to hail , the horses plunging and rearing like wild creatures as they fought to turn their backs to the storm , and now Morissa discovered one purpose of the roweled spurs and the cruel lit that so often brought blood from the cowboy 's horse . But she thought of the man with his neck broken , and spurred on , too , trying to keep the lean rump of the bay ahead within sight in the hail and rain . It was clearing for dawn when they suddenly came out on a broad flat ringed in by low hills , the hail white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The herd 'll be scattered to hell ' n ' gone . Take weeks to get a fair lot of ' em together . But at least they ai n't dead at the foot of some bluff up here like they would be on some ranges . Ai n't a canyon or a bluff within two hundred miles east , so far as I know , " the cowboy called back to Morissa . As they neared the trail wagons drawn up close together out in the flat , a wrangler came walking awkwardly to meet them , his boots crunching the hail . " Yeh , " he said , taking the horses , " he 's alive . We pulled the wagons up on both sides of him and spread a tarp to keep off the hail , but it 's been damn cold for a hurt man ? " Morissa stooped under the canvas to look down at Sid Martin in the light of the morning lantern . He was conscious , turning only his painfilled eyes to the young woman , his gaunt face gray . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the man 's head and slid her fingers gently , very gently , along under his neck until she found a displacement , what seemed an appalling displacement ,  | so she gave him a stiff dose of morphine . " You 've been amazingly courageous not to move all this time , but maybe I 'll have to hurt you , and even the slightest jerk ? " From the man 's eyes she knew he understood , had known from the first , and she blessed the knowledge of anatomy these men of the outdoors learned , their perception . When Sid Martin seemed to doze , she went to work , very carefully , remembering how tender the spinal cord was , recalling the pulpiness of the gray-white mass even in autopsies ? much of it soft as a custard . A thousand times this morning she wished that she were old in experience , double her twenty-four years , triple them if it would give her the skill to save this man 's life . Every second she feared for the stopped heart that would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her care . And every bit of gain must be held with her numbing hands until she gathered control and force enough to apply the next gentle , steady little pull on the head , always toward her  --  not the tiniest fraction of an inch to one side or the other  --  until there could be space enough to clear the cord , realign the vertebrae . Once the cook touched her shoulder and held a tin cup of hot coffee to her lips with his hairy hands . She shook the sweat from her face and looked about , amazed to see the sun high as her head , the hail all gone from the pounded earth except in the draws that were like the white patches running up the flanks of a calico-dun . She swallowed the coffee gratefully , awkwardly , while she steadied the man 's head , but he seemed to be coming out of the opiate . Quickly she had the cook administer a little more morphia , and nodded the watching men to her . " Get me some heavy leather , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They brought a couple of leather skirts from the gear wagon , and an empty flour sack to make a pattern under her direction . Their boss must have a cast to hold the break in place , but it could n't be tight as a plaster cast on a leg , or of anything that would shrink to cut off his breath , or that would break , if he was n't to die . So , while she held the head and the man slept , almost relaxed now , they cut the skirts to fit the pattern a couple of the cowboys had managed to make around her hands . They joined the pieces with copper rivets from the cook 's ditty box and made a lacing up the side with rawhide strings , a tongue underneath for firmness . Then they eased the leather brace around the man , digging earth away under the neck and shoulders because they dared not lift him . By the time Sid Martin was awakening , he was in a neck-and-shoulder boot , stiff as sole-leather . He was laced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , except directly down from the chin where side pads of cotton prevented choking . But the sides arched up against the jaws solid as iron to prevent turning the head . Now Morissa stretched the ache from her knees while she waited ,  | and slowly Sid Martin became aware of those watching him , all his help here except the two gone to locate the stampeding herd . He tried to move and was held down by an arm across his chest , saw it was a young woman and smiled a little as in a dream . But gradually he remembered . A long time he seemed to be taking stock of himself . " My hands and feet do n't seem to be so numb , " he said slowly , and the doctor nodded . And as he grasped the extent of the leather brace , he grinned . " Think you got me trapped fer sure , do n't you , Doc , Miss Doc Morissa ? " he said , but the strain on his face showed that he understood . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the long rough distance back without a trail for wheel or pony drag . After he relaxed a little from the first realization , Morissa went over him carefully , searching out any bruise , any sore and tender spot internally , but she found nothing else . So she settled to a late dinner of fried beef , sore-thumb bread , and canned peaches , wondering how long she dared remain here , with Tom Reeder alone and unfed at the bridge , and no telling what other emergencies might come up . She needed a nurse there and a little hospital , even if only two rooms . Perhaps Robin would build one before he went to his next job . A soddy with four , five rooms for now , she thought , a little amused that it had grown so fast from the two rooms of just a moment ago . There would be a long space with rods for division curtains , and a lot of windows for geraniums and sunlight . The house should be built with a sheltered south alcove to sun any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to Sidney now . " You pull me out a this , Doc , and you sign your own ticket ? " Sid Martin said , cautiously trying to ease the stiffness from his legs . " Maybe you 'll feel different when your neck 's in one piece again ? and it may be more in one piece than you think . I look for a section stiff as a plank ? " " Stiff , hell ! ? Excuse me , but it was limber as a wet saddle string when I tried to get up last night . " " I think the doc here needs her a good team and buggy , " the cowpuncher who had come for Morissa suggested . She laughed at the absurd fee and sat a while , comfortable , warm , and happy and good in the silence of the lean , sunburnt men who had no itching need to talk and keep talking . After a while they got up , bit off their suds , and worked them into juicing as they climbed their horses . Suddenly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lost letter for a long time , not since a cowboy rode shouting out of the storm last night . But perhaps Morissa would not need a team and buggy or even the sidesaddle Robin ordered sent up from Sidney ; she would not want the  | house here , with her trees and flowers growing so well from the rain that followed the hailstorm . Late one afternoon while Morissa was out beyond the bridge picking a bucket of mushrooms from a witches ' ring , a large and bedraggled party of a hundred fifty or more came down from Deadwood . The news had been brought in by horsebackers who ran into them up the trail and hurried back to cry the alarm and , in the way of men , share all bad tidings gladly . " The Black Hills are busted ! " they shouted . " The gold 's played out ! " The bridge dwellers were well accustomed to rumors by now , particularly alarms of Indian uprisings and the mines running dry . But this seemed serious . " Looks like somebody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " the bridge tender said , and spit off over the railing as the delapidated wagons came toward the river . Everybody was out to watch as they stopped on the far side , and their captain , a recent candidate for state governor , came over to see his friend Clarke . Yes , it was true , the mines were done , he said , speaking quietly . Played out . They had tried to stay on , hoping , and now many were flat broke , without enough left to pay their toll . " ? If you ca n't see your way clear to let us cross , Henry , we 'll have to go down on the other side ? " " But that 's around a hundred thirty miles over old washed-out trail ? " Clarke protested . So he let them all across , but it was a gloomy night in the valley of the North Platte . Robin Thomas came down from his grading in the White River country to talk to Clarke about it , and then made a turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bigger freight outfits . This was not like the stampeders on opening day . This time nobody stood away from the men . While there seemed few professional miners in the party , they were plainly not the usual Sunday gold seekers , afraid to bend the back over pick and shovel . Perhaps Tom Reeder had found the last good pocket , or , as some of the party slyly suggested , obtained his gold in other ways . Nobody knew of a one-man placer strike that big , and keeping it secret sounded fishy as a mud hen , but there were plenty of holdups and mine robbers around . After a while , when enough whisky had been set up to them , a couple dozen of the party went over to Morissa Kirk 's and demanded to see this man Reeder . At first the young doctor stood against the ragged , half-drunken crowd at the wagon step , Robin 's Colt hanging at her slim hip , but when there were angry murmurings and threats she moved inside and let them line up for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat beside Tom Reeder while they did this , the man 's pale , frightened eyes turning to her hand , steady on the grip of the revolver that he knew she had never fired at a man , and then back  | to the flushed dark-bearded faces looking in , the lantern light reddening their eyes . Afterward she sent the men away with short , cold words , and went back into the wagon where her patient was shaking as from the ague under the buffalo robe . " Fools ! ? all a lot of fools ! Both gold and the failure to obtain it seem to work the same , " she said , and when Reeder once more refused her demand that he be moved to Sidney , she admitted that he might be better off here while this exaggerated terror possessed him . I Iere he seemed to trust at least one person . All this time Morissa had her own kind of shaking ague . She had not replied to Allston 's lost letter and when no further message came she tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen other approaches that she hoped would not betray their intention , like an antelope hunter 's deceptive round-about pursuit , for how was Allston to know that his letter had ever reached her ? And who could say what change the days might have made in his attitude , in him , even since he wrote ? But in her calmer moments she tore up the telegrams and the notes she wrote him , notes that did not refer to the letter , passed it off as a joke , pretended to misunderstand his meaning , or told a half-truth , that the letter had been lost to her . She tore them all up , for Allston Hoyt was no antelope to be stalked so foolishly . And now , if the gold at the end of the Sidney trail was done , she must really pack up and start over again , the third time in her three years out of medical school . Carrying the hollowness of this within her , she walked out past the guards into the darkness of the bridge and stood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the water , over the murmur , the sweet , cool smell of it , and heard the frogs , the chatter of ducks , and the thumping of a shitepoke off in a marshy spot somewhere . V MORISSA HAD NEVER SEEN SO FLOWERY A REGION , OR ONE SO fragrant . First there were the Easter daisies , bright soon after the snow , and then came the sweetness of the sand lilies , the golden banner , purple sweetpeas , and the wild plums and chokecherries . Great patches of violets stretched along the bottoms , followed by a scattering of blue tulip gentians , and higher up , clumps of blue beardtongue and tangles  | of wild roses . Later the gravelly knolls carpeted themselves in the purple , white , and cerise of loco peas , and the ridges beyond carried the waxy white spikes of yuccas and the yellow and flame of cactus bloom . With all this tapestry of color it seemed sad that the isolated ranches stood so bare . Perhaps a cottonwood shimmered beside the watering place or the windmill ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick upon the corrals . Without a woman at the log and sod shacks , there was not a planted flower for two hundred miles up and down the river except at Etty 's stockade and now at Robin 's old soddy . The willows Morissa set out were shooting up fast and the little cottonwoods rustled over the morning carpet of portulacas . When she first came , Etty 's Lorette had beckoned the young doctor into her garden plot . There she thrust her spade into the patch of volunteers that sprouted thick as some fleshy russet fur from last year 's bed of moss roses . She lifted a sod of them for Morissa 's apron . " You can pull ' part , " the heavy-bodied young woman had suggested . Now a month later the seedlings had spread into a mat of color under the long morning shadows . There was a gay sun chair too that Robin made from a cut-down salt barrel , covered , back and all , with a spotted cowhide . He made a bumbershoot to stand over it from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scallops hanging down all around the edge . By now the cowboys had taken to stopping in . " Could I trouble you for the borry of a match ? " one might say , and Morissa would offer the box , smiling at the man 's sheepish grin . " I thought you all kept to chewing tobacco on the range , with the fire hazard ? " " Yes , ma'am , but when I comes off it , I likes to roll me a prairie burner ? " Then perhaps the man would squat on his heels at the door awhile , his horse standing with patient reins dragging . Sometimes he might say as many as five words to the antelope nosing along the yard fence while Morissa kneaded bread sponge or folded powders . Finally the man would reseat his old Stetson , swing into the saddle and lope away , the heels of his horse kicking up dust as measured as volleys of bullets hitting the earth . Sometimes Lorette came , moving ponderously across the bottoms from Etty 's stockade , to throw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Morissa . Etty had run several whisky and billiard saloons along the early trails but she preferred it here at the ancient Indian crossing . Her French father had sent her East to a Sisters school for a few years and she could read and write and embroider , too , Morissa discovered , her silken work lovely as delicate paint strokes . But now she was heavy with child , her fifth , only two left alive  | by diphtheria . Although Lorette had returned to the blanket , she asked , in her soft Indian way , about Morissa 's hats , and about a good school for her girls when they grew older . " Their father he say they must be same like white ? " she murmured wistfully . " And they will be very pretty , as they are already , " Morissa agreed , thinking of their soft dusky brown hair , the oval of their French faces . Lorette looked modestly down and seemed pleased , but with the sadness of a woman whose husband would have his daughters depart from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morissa knew , to the Sioux in Lorette , where a man customarily left his people for his wife 's . The young doctor tried to make her neighbor feel welcome , weary as she was for a woman 's face among so many men . Then one day while Lorette was there , Etty rode in with a deer across his saddle . The woman sprang up so fast she dropped a teacup and fled for the stockade without the mannerly apology she had been taught . The next day she held her blanket close about her head when Morissa came for some string to train her morning glories . She turned her eyes down , without greeting , but it was plain that her face was bruised and swollen . Two evenings later Etty came riding over and Morissa went uneasily to the door , expecting some complaint . He was excited but because his wife 's time had come and none of the medicine women were around to help . " I think maybe the baby she come backward , like the colt somet ime ? " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be in pain . But Lorette was strong and patient and young . By morning Etty had a son , his first , and Morissa went home to drop to her cot without undressing . She still did not know why the Frenchman had beaten his wife , whether because she was visiting the doctor when he came home or for some more private reason , perhaps out of male resentment against the prolonged self-containment that pregnancy was . But Morissa realized now that she must move cautiously here . Before nine in the morning a man from Sid Martin stopped by . " The boss was rarin ' to get on a horse couple days after you was up , but he 's been gettin ' yellow as them old puff balls since : Out a his head all last night . " Morissa rubbed her eyes wearily , trying to wake up . " Any pain , maybe wider the ribs somewhere ? " " No , guess not , but his head 's a bustin ' , he says . " So the doctor put her saddlebags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due north , anglin ' off east a mite  --  You ca n't miss it , " the cowboy had called back as he rode on toward Sidney . That " anglin ' off " direction for her first trip alone into the vast , undifferentiated country of the sandhills made Morissa uneasy , but with Robin 's little compass  | she held the Appaloosa from following what seemed a far bunch of wild horses but might be Indians , the men hanging on the far side to avoid detection . Sid Martin did look bad inside his worn leather neck brace  --  gaunt , yellow , with a slow pulse , whether from an injury in his fall or from gallstones or infective jaundice she could n't decide in a moment . She gave him a mild liver dose and a diuretic and had the cook make up a blanc-mange flavored with the vanilla she brought . The patient seemed improved by the time she had to start back . " Feed him like a sick man , not fried beef and beans , " she ordered . " Graveyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morissa nodded . " Yes , if you can get the milk , " and wrote out a diet and dosing list . " And better take him out of here . " She felt so worn that she could scarcely climb into the sidesaddle . Yet she had to hurry to get out of the hills before dark . Several times she caught herself dozing in the hot afternoon sun . She pulled herself up firm and erect for a while , watching the occasional antelope spring from his resting , looking back over his white rump as he ran , and once she raised a deer in a pocket of buckbrush . Yet it seemed only a moment until she was nodding again , even with the Appaloosa 's swinging gait . Sit it slow and stand it fast , Makes both man and horse to last , she sang to herself , trying to keep awake with the jingling advice for the trot Robin gave young Jackie with his first pony . But still her head drooped , sagged lower and lower , until suddenly she felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . When she came down she hit head first , so hard it seemed her skull crushed in like a hollow pumpkin . A long time afterward Morissa Kirk began to come out of a deep darkness , her stomach retching . With bursting head she held herself together as well as she could and gradually her eyes cleared until she could see grass before her face and thought suddenly of the rattlesnakes . But when she tried to sit up everything spun around and she was sick again . Afterward she tried to think . The throbbing head and periodic vomiting meant concussion . She had been thrown by her horse out in the open sandhills , far from any trail . Only Martin 's men knew where she had been and they would n't discover that she was missing for a long , long time . Miserably she wondered once more what she was doing in such a wilderness , when people needed doctors everywhere , and when there was even Allston Hoyt and his letter assuring her that her birth need be no obstacle , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cheeks . When she could , she tried out her back , her arms , and legs . Apparently nothing was seriously hurt except her head , with the recurring  | nausea like a dark storm rolling out of the horizon to shake her until she lay limp and exhausted in the grass , counting to time the intervals , to gauge the injury . In her clearer moments she tried to plan what must be done . Slowly she lifted herself to an elbow , holding her reeling head when she must . There was something nearby and when her eyes focused she saw it was the Appaloosa , quietly grazing . She must have taken the knotted reins with her when she went over his head , probably in a side jump or a stumble . Now , reins down , he was waiting as Robin had trained him , and suddenly she understood the deep and trusting affection of the cowman for his horse . But night was coming and she did not dare go near the Appaloosa yet , the retching sure to frighten him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if he did not get in with the wild horses or was lost to the Indians . So she drew herself together upon her quivering stomach as an ailing child would . With her hair loose to spread about her , and the denim riding skirt drawn up around her shoulders against the chill , too , she managed to sleep a little between the intervals of sickness . Coyotes howled along the hills , with the thin yip of pups somewhere close by , and an occasional long-drawn-out howl from a prairie wolf . When dawn finally came she was shaking with cold , her throat raw and dry , a lump like a rounded plateau on the left side of her aching head . Weak and stiff she tried to sit up and finally she stood , bent over , yet on her feet . The Appaloosa was nowhere in sight . Slowly she moved to a higher knob , stooping to the sickness when she must . But the morning hills seemed empty , bare except for a grazing antelope and a prairie chicken calling to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all standing innocent and open , staring at the woman on the hillside . Morissa tried to whistle and then called " Appaloosa ! " At the first sound the young chickens were gone , the prairie hen fluttering along the grass tops to toll danger away . But there was no sign of the horse , probably driven by thirst to some far pond or creek , or gone . Finally , when Morissa thought to try a loud Indian whoop , a head lifted from a low place , a gray head , ears erect . The horse came no closer but it was a comfort that he was there , with the saddle in place , even when he started to move on , slowly , holding his jaw sideways to avoid the dragging reins . Morissa started toward him , stumbling , crawling , the grass cutting her palms , but hurrying in spite of her fear of rattlesnakes , stopping only a moment once to braid her hair out of her eyes , for with the sun the Appaloosa 's thirst would grow . He snorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse trail , but he only drew back a step or two and waited as her hand crept toward the reins at his feet . Then he came to rub his nose against the girl 's stooping shoulder , nickering softly .  | She pulled herself up with the stirrup and tightened the girth as well as she could . Making herself speak quietly , steadily , " Whoa , ' Paloosa , whoa , boy ? " she went up along the stirrup leather , choking back the waves of nausea , until at last she was mounted . It was old Etty , out for a little fresh meat , who saw the Appaloosa coming slowly down a long slope toward the Platte . The doctor was leaning low over his neck , her disheveled hair hanging down into the thick inane of the horse that the girl had twisted around her wrist to keep from falling off when the dark waves of sickness broke over her . So Etty brought Morissa Kirk in , leading the horse , people running out across the bridge to see , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . By morning Morissa felt better , still weak , with a headache , but probably without permanent damage . Beside her sat Lorette , silent . " You should be home and in bed ! " the doctor scolded . " It is now the third day , " Lorette said cheerfully , and went to make a cup of tea . " A man he come from the Sid Martin , " she called over the singing kettle . " He say Sid be better . " So Morissa drank her tea and turned her face to the wall to sleep . But first she should write a note to be sent to Robin : " Your training showed up well . Appaloosa did not leave me . " Early Sunday morning Tris Polk tied his horse to a yard post and walked up between the flower beds , come to take Morissa to watch Bill Tillow , the wild horse catcher , handle some of his stock . " We do n't commonly take Eastern women to see these bronch bustings . They do n't understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse ? But you 're not so cold-footed , " he said . Now he spoke of her accident . " We 've been worried about you . I heard clear up at Deadwood that you were left hurt out on the prairie , " he said as he walked beside the girl to the Appaloosa , not looking at her , making the words quiet ones , as though about someone else . They met Robin and Jackie coming down the trail . In their Western way they made no fuss , but Robin saw the yellowish stain left at the girl 's temple , and a pallor that remained from her fall . " A day in the sun will be good for all of us , " he said heartily , and was caught up in the absurdity of his tongue by the laughter in the sunburnt faces . They had brought Eddie Ellis along . He was back working at Red Cloud Agency since the bridge rush was over . Even in the dust of the trail Ed 's blue eyes looked like those of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-lashed child smiling through tears , but a child with full , aggressive lips barely shadowed by beard . Together the little party headed eastward , around a great plot of bull-tongue cactus with hundreds of blossoms large as cupped hands ,  | greenish-yellow satin , with dusty bumblebees buzzing drowsily . A couple of young antelope huddled in the middle of - the patch , the ears so nearly the shape and size of the cactus tongues that only Tris could have noticed them . Although Jack and Eddie rode up very near , the little creatures just scrooched closer to the earth , remaining by instinct where no soft-padded animal  --  coyote , wolf , or mountain lion  --  would brave the inch-long spines of the cactus . " We better hurry or we 'll miss too much , " Tris called to the boys . The horse catchers had only a small herd of wild stuff in the canyon corral they put up lately . The big herds were farther off north , up around the Box Butte country , part of the million or so of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a few stable-fed Spanish stock . The horses were fast , tough , pawing the snow for winter feed , afraid of nothing except mountain lions in timber or rocky country where they could drop to the defenseless backs  --  no problem on the open prairies . Morissa nodded thoughtfully . " Something like that 's happening to us Americans out here , " she said , as she looked at the man riding beside her , the fine ease of the long body in the saddle , the lean narrow hips , the lean face , and the difference in color and cut of raiment here . As usual , except when working cattle , Tris wore light fawn-colored chaps and hat , with dark trousers and shirt , blue today , and a yellow silk muffler knotted at the nape of his neck . It went well with Morissa 's yellow shirtwaist that pointed up the golden lights of the sun in her hair and in the hazel of her eyes . Against Tris 's skin , burned Indian-dark , the yellow made his eyes darker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and living smoke . But always the eyes were aloof , and for just a moment Morissa caught herself wondering what passion would bring to them and had to turn her burning face away , feeling the man 's presence beside her as though his hand were cupped on her yielding shoulder . Angrily she reminded herself of what she was , how one man had received it . So the young doctor 's eyes found a refuge in the three riding ahead , Eddie on a fast horse , always a step out in front of the others . " He seems to know where the corral is located , " she said , to make talk . " Oh , Ellis would know , even though the corral 's just built , " Tris replied , almost angrily . " The horse-thief trail from the Indian herds crosses there , leading off down through the wilder breaks to the Platte . " Morissa nodded , recalling the trail vaguely from the morning after her fall , but then grew uneasy as she realized the man 's resentment and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . " Oh , Ed probably saw the corral while out hunting sometime , " she said reasonably , without convincing herself .  | Tris rode silently beside her until there was a shouting and they turned to follow Robin 's pointing gauntlet . But instead of the horse corral it was a bunch of range steers , with an old buffalo bull fighting them off , fighting off their curiosity as well as their anger . The bull was ragged , with reddish patches of wool hanging everywhere , his thin tail switching as he made furious little charges this way and that , his small eyes lost in the curling mat of his forehead , angry froth dripping from his jaws . " Is he mad , rabic ? " " Oh , I do n't think so . Just fighting ? " " Somebody 'll get him inside of a week , the meat old and stringy as rawhide , " Robin said . " Dry weather and heat probably drove him out of hiding in the breaks for water . " Finally Eddie led them around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rocky , brushy box canyon filled with dust . The wild horses , about fifty , had been driven inside the long arms of a trap corral that was joined to the high sandstone canyon , the lower opening closed by a pole and brush wall and gate , built high as a man could reach  --  high enough so the mustangs could n't get a nose over or they would be climbing them like cats . They were circling away from bowlegged Bill Tillow in the center of the corral . He spread his loop this way and that , the horses trying to keep their heads back behind others , all of them trying to hide except one bold mare , bright as a red fox , taking the lone , unprotected front as the roper waited his chance , the horse he wanted sensing it as they circled , keeping back against the corral wall . Suddenly they got the scent of newcomers and stopped , heads lifted that way . Morissa held in her Appaloosa to look down on them , through the lifting dust  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue smoke , a black or two , and the clouded white of calicos and paints . The powerful necks were raised high , the manes falling thick and long , their tails reaching the ground . At a switch of the rope they ran again . This time the loop snaked out and an iron gray was suddenly left behind as the rest broke from him . Bill threw a dally around the short snubbing post in the center of the corral ; the gray hit the end of the rope and went over . Morissa gasped . " Oh , he 'll break every bone ! " she cried . " You 'll get used to seeing them do that ? " Tris said , laughing gently . Still , the girl felt foolish , a tenderfoot , and yet horses did injure themselves . But the gray was up immediately and already knew how he could ease his choking breath . At the first little pull of the rope he took a step toward the man and , because the slack was gone immediately , he took another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blood  | flecking the foam on the wind , his whitish eyes enraged , but his feet obedient . " Sure looks like the booger 's gone against a rope before , " Tris said to the men at the gate . They nodded , their eyes sneaking shy looks under their curled , dusty hatbrims to the young woman and her Appaloosa . Slowly Bill worked the horse in , until the gray made a great lunge to escape the nearing smell of man and the cutting rope , and as he went down again , the dappled body rocking in the dust , Hank dropped from the fence and was on the neck with a knee . A hand turned up the flaring nose while with the other he eased the rope on the windpipe a little . In the meantime Bill threw a breaker W on his legs , so even a child 's jerk on the strings , the rope , could bring the horse to his knees . " Wo n't those hard falls injure him ? " Morissa asked , still the doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morissa . They 're tougher than you think . And it 's certainly better than letting a horse get away or kill a man , accidentally or deliberate . Now and then there is a killer among them , a horse that 'll make straight for you , paw you down . " With a hackamore hitch around the gray 's snorting nose to relieve the choke of the loop , Hank grabbed his W string and let the horse up . The gray stood a moment , shaking , and then he tried a kick against the ropes . He was jerked down , and then again , but when he scrabbled back up the second time he lifted his head toward the hackamore man as in curiosity , in friendliness , testing the wind with a rolling lip . No one moved , the wild herd squeezed off in a corner watching . Now slowly Bill began his soft , coaxing horse talk as he started down the rope , his voice quiet but firm . " Whoa there , you boogerin ' son of a gun , whoa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the rope , " Whoa ? " Once the horse looked around to the string man behind him and then instead of drawing up close like a folding accordion to get as far as possible from the approaching hand , he took a step forward . " Oh , so you know what I want , you little booger ? " Bill said , approving , and pulled at the rope a little . To this the horse reared back , and was brought to his knees by a jerk on the W. When he got up he looked around to Hank once more and then took a meekish step forward to the next pull . Then Bill turned his back and , drawing on the rope , walked slowly away , the gray following  --  the horse from the wild herd leading almost as well as a work mare . " Why , it 's amazing  --  what that man can do with a horse ! " Morissa exclaimed . Tris lifted his hat and shook his thick hair into the wind . " Yes .  | Probably wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that and not make at least one good try to get away , or get his man . " Cupping his hand to his mouth he called out to Bill : " You better look for a brand or rope burn on that horse . He 's got away somewheres and gone wild . " The men in the corral grinned and Bill spit into the dust . " Aimin ' to put your brand on ' im , Polk ? " he asked . " We ai n't found no saddle sign but I kinda thought all along he 's smelled rope before . " At noon they had beanhole beans with sowbelly thick in them , dutch oven biscuits and coffee , followed by a sack of raisin bunches from Tris 's saddlebags for a little sweetening , although the horse outfit had all put half a finger of sugar into their coffee for that . But they ate the raisins anyway , crunching the seeds and talking horse in short , terse phrases . A big herd hung out up around Snake Creek flats someplace . Lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Deadwood market . They 'd get ' em , at least when the snow got deep . Afterward Tris and Morissa went to sit on a high rocky bank far above the corral wall while Bill and Hank saddled the gray . The horse blew himself up against the girth , but he had n't been hard to get the leather on after he smelled it , or to mount . He moved out around the corral in an easy jaunt , Bill holding the broncho 's head up with a close bit , keeping his spurs turned out . " Why do n't you give him his head , let him go to it outside ? " Jackie called out . " There ai n't no good hazin ' horse amongst us , an ' we ai n't here to make runaways or outlaws . What we got ta do is make ' em lead a little , and take hobbles without breakin ' a leg . They do the bustin ' down to the corrals at Sidney . We 're the catchers ? " Bill said , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Heck , I 'll ride him out in the open if you 're ' fraid ! " Morissa heard her brother in surprise , and shook her head to him , " Never put your arm out farther than you can draw it back ? " she advised . But Jack would n't show that he heard . " Do n't let that gray fool you , son , " Hank advised . " He ai n't just strayed outa somebody 's ridin ' string . He knows a rope damn well , but he ai n't got no saddle marks an ' cal'lates not to have none ? " " Why do n't Tris here ride ' im ? " Eddie Ellis suggested , looking up toward the two on the bank . " He 's got somebody to show off to ? " But stubbornly Jackie still insisted on his prior claim , until Robin promised that he could go down to the breaking corrals at Sidney sometime to try it . " Just let me know the day ? " Jack told the men at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Eddie was persistent too . " Why do n't you ride ' im , Tris ? Ground 's soft here , and you got your doc along ? " " Oh , this is my Sunday off , " Morissa interrupted . But she felt the antagonism towards Tris , and so she turned her attention to him , leaving the boys without an audience . The next horse caught was a zebra-legged buckskin that fought the rope all the way , and when he was saddled on the ground , with Hank astride him and the blind snapped off , he went up into the air again and again . " Look at that belly full a bedsprings ! " Robin said , laughing , but it was just straight hard bucking and suddenly he quit . Flank slipped off and wiped the sweat out of his hat band . Technically the horse had been ridden . But next the rope settled on a fine fox sorrel mare , around five or six , well-fleshed , alert , powerful . She hit the end of the rope going away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately , her eyes red , her lips drawn back , and fast as a cat she charged upon Bill , her forehoofs flailing out for him . He jerked the rope to take up the slack at the dally , to get beyond the mare 's reach . But the rope had got crossed against the pull , and the loop that Hank snapped out for a foot missed too . Bill fled for the gate and rolled under it just as the mare was upon him , hitting the solid poles a thunderous crack that echoed in the narrow box canyon . By now Hank was at the rope around the snubbing post to release it , draw up the slack , but the mustang turned on him , her sides heaving , her teeth bared like a snarling wolf 's , and he ran , too , the men at the gate flapping their hats to draw the angry mare 's attention , and chunking her with clods . " Whew , a born outlaw ! " Tris called to Jack . " Ride that one for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the young doctor thought she saw something else in the mare , something wild and incorruptible that brought a smarting to Morissa 's eyes , and anger running through the breast , anger against the rope too , and the tormenting humans . Yet the men came from all sides upon the fox mare now , and got the rope solid to the snubbing post once more , only this time she would not go against it . Instead she fought the rope , snapped her jaws on it , struck at it for the enemy it was , and fought off the men bringing more ropes , fought panting and foam-flecked , her sides heaving , her hoofs like lightning in the dusty heat . And when Hank finally snagged a hind leg and she felt the pull there , too , she made one final attempt to break free . She reared , going up into the air , up in a great flying , pawing leap , and then came down forward on her head , her neck folded under , and lay still , the spurts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her .  | " That 's too bad , " Tris exclaimed into the silence . " What a saddler she would have made ! " " Oh , no ! " Morissa cried out , the tautness in her arms a paining . " She could have been gentled with a bucket of oats , and a patient , affectionate hand , " the man said quietly . But Morissa wanted to cry out against this also . Such brightness , such wild spirit was not to be betrayed , not to the saddle , the rope , and the bit and spur . As the men dragged the dusty carcass of the mare out with their saddle horses , young Morissa Kirk turned her face away , looking up around the quietness of the canyon rim . But there , against the pale sky , were three riders standing close together , watching . Something strange about them made them fit into the doctor 's sorrow about the mare , a free wildness that could not be bound , and only when they whirled and were gone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had seen . " Indians ! " she cried , pointing to the empty skyline . " Looking for horses , " Tris said , as he started away , running awkwardly in his boot heels toward the Appaloosa grazing on a picket rope . The horse catchers spurred out to round up their riding stock and then they divided , swinging around the canyon both ways to flush the skulking Indians . " May be too many for us to stand off , if they are n't gone already , " Robin said uneasily . " They want horses mighty bad  --  thieves got too many . Besides , they 're restless about all the whites coming in . We better ride . " Mounted , the visitors swung off down the mouth of the canyon and out upon open prairie to avoid a possible ambush . " The Indians may be following the horse-thief trail , " Tris said , looking over toward Jack and Eddie Ellis riding close together but hurrying , too , headed for the Sidney trail and down it through the evening sunlight until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably seldom be out of sight of travelers or trail camps . Then the others turned back north . Morissa looked after them , somehow uneasy about her brother , with the Ellis boy so much , and yet glad that he had found a friend . The lanterns were already lit on the bridge ends when the two reached the valley of the Platte , and the campfires scattered along the stream seemed peaceful and undisturbed in the dusk . Morissa 's head felt sore again from the fall last week and her back was stiff after the long ride in the sidesaddle today . She wanted to accustom the people here to seeing her ride astride , forked , so much safer and easier , but she had larger ventures in mind for the future and so must make the little conformities now . At the soddy Tris helped her off and for a second it seemed he would  | kiss her , but he gave her the opportunity to turn her face away without seeming to , with no words needed , no notice of it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt up in those hills alone , " he said gruffly , and swung into his saddle . Morissa went to the wagon to see her patient but she stopped outside to look into the darkness after Tris . She thought about the wild horses that had fought the rope so hard , and about the dead mare , red as a fox . The big picnic for the visiting Britisher , Harry McApp , had to be put off because he broke his foot in a runaway , but the Walkers were giving a reception for him and some American financial and packinghouse representatives at Sidney , Tris told Morissa . " It wo n't be as much fun for you as the picnic but a better chance to see you look pretty . " Morissa wondered about her sunburnt face above the whiteness of her throat and shoulders , like the face of some remote gypsy ancestor peering through , but she was not one to plaster her skin with whiting . So the next few times she was out in the hills alone she slipped her shirtwaist down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden quality of her skin , evidently a gift from a non-Scottish father , she thought ruefully , did make burning less likely . When Tris came for her at the hotel in Sidney her reward was in his eyes as he saw the smooth , tawny shoulders above the handsome gold-shot reseda gown of summer taffeta . It brought out the golden flecks in her eyes , and the shining glint in her dark bangs and in the brows that were like bronzed swallow wings . " Marry me ? " Tris Polk said softly . " Marry me tonight at the post here . " Morissa tried to laugh . " Why , of course , darling , but shall we look in on the Walker reception first ? There is a financier and a packer for your attention , a broken foot for mine , " turning it aside as lightly as she could . And when Tris started to protest his seriousness , she put her hand through his arm and drew him along . " Choose a Sunday maid and yell hae a Sunday wife ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a kitchen apron sometime ? " The evening was a gay one . " Our ladies here are as lovely as any in New York or Paris or even Chicago , " a white-haired meat packer said to Morissa , and he sounded surprised , although the women were almost all city-bred , three from Britain , including the tiny , whimsical doll-like actress , Grace Enders . Gowned in heaven-blue satin with a train stiff and elegant as a bluebird 's tail , she fluttered a moment beside her Harry 's chair and crutch , and then was away . Even the warehouse where the reception was held , for lack of larger banquet space in the raw border town , had a kind of grandeur . Partitions  | had been knocked out to make a long , spacious room and a platform dance floor was laid upon the hard-packed earth . Buffalo , grizzly , mountain-lion and goat skins covered most of the log walls , with ranch gear  --  fine silver-mounted guns , saddles , bridles and spurs  --  hung against the skins , relieved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spaced along the walls were buffalo-horn candle holders , like clustered upright , light-bearing cornucopias . There were silver candlesticks for the long tables of planks laid across empty barrels and covered by the Walker family napery , with bowls of blue penstemon and waxy yucca blooms , and the gleam of Walker cut glass and silver . There was champagne on ice in flower-banked lard buckets , and the meats varied from trout to bear , through young antelope , beaver tail , grouse , and quail . Under the talk and the pleasant sound of the tables a string quartet from Omaha played chamber music . The evening began as gayly as Morissa 's engagement dinner that Allston Hoyt had arranged , with even more compliments , although these were from a different people . The whole occasion was planned , she suspected , to sell ranches or ranch shares to the syndicate represented by Harry McApp . As Morissa looked over the tables she thought about her plans to take up a homestead , become a despised settler , and then she recalled a few words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the meat packer , beside him . " Slaughterhouses near the herds , that 's the best way . If you had a railroad at your bridge ? " So , if Clarke had the railroad there might be a packing house at the bridge , Morissa thought . But she had been inattentive to the young Englishman at her left and must bring herself back . It was easy enough . There were half a dozen men for every woman here tonight and it was the first fun she had had since that afternoon with Alicia Hoyt , the afternoon that sent her here rather than to McApp 's own Scotland . The dancing later was a lovely sight . Cantwell Walker , sunburnt as from India against the whiteness of his linen , led the grand march with the tiny blue-gowned Grace Enders . But many eyes followed the tall pair that was the Texas cowman Tris Polk and the handsome , even elegant young woman who claimed to be a doctor and had come so mysteriously to bury herself in the wilds of the north valley for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter of the Chicago packer , was attracted to the romantic Texan , or told to seem attracted , Morissa could n't decide which . Still , with a blond young Englishman from McApp 's entourage happy to bow over the hand of a wilderness doctor , Morissa was content until Tris came brusquely with her velvet wrap to take her away . It was late , even for Sidney , but the saloons and the dance halls were still open , full of bearded freighters , trail drivers , gold seekers and neat blue-clad troopers from Sidney Barracks , troopers waiting for the Indian wars . No one here seemed depressed by the rumors that the Hills were  | played out , unless that was behind the two gold bricks put to gleam in the bright , lamp-lit window of the bank plain for all to see but protected by sturdy , hand-forged iron bars . Tris and Morissa edged through the crowd . " There are three guards with sawed-off shotguns watching through slits in the curtain , they tell me , " he said . He spoke softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one slipped away into the crowd . " Cut Lip Johnson , " Tris whispered to Morissa . " Wyoming outlaw . " So they moved on through the milling street , slowly , like two sightseers , Morissa holding her skirts above the rough planking and the dusty earth walks beyond . " It 's been a lovely evening , " she said afterward , speaking a little sadly into the silence between them , but when Tris drew her gently toward him , it was her cheek she turned to the cattleman . The next day she was n't on the stagecoach headed up the gold trail when he went to see her off . Instead she had taken the train east to the land office and filed on the homestead and preemption . The quarter she wanted as a timberclaim was covered and she selected another  --  altogether 480 acres of her own . A month ago the North Platte valley had been a temporary refuge , a haven in desperation because Robin was there . But now he was gone , and all that was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settler to push in north of the river . Suicidal , Robin had called it , and yet perhaps that was what she sought ; certainly it was suicide for her career that had been so well launched only a month ago . Even now she could return to Omaha where she had been invited to join the rising medical group  --  the first woman so honored . Only two years out of medical school and she already had professional standing there . What if she was a woman rejected , did life stop for that ? Or was this suicide what she really wanted  --  and to make the guilty knowledge of his part in it an eternal accusation to Allston Hoyt ? Was it , too , at the bottom of her attitude toward Tris Polk ? That she was drawn to him as a man much more than to Allston would have been clear to any doctor with a patient named Morissa Kirk , yet she was choosing a lone homestead in the wilderness instead of a good life in Texas as Mrs. Polk , or in Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down along the railroad . But Allston was something far beyond the physical to her , and in a moment she was broken into incoherence by even this thinnest edge of thought . With her handkerchief to her lips she fled from the land office , but the papers of her entry were clutched tightly in her hand . On the way back to Sidney Morissa tried to plan . She knew she must live on her new land to hold it , and next spring plant the ten acres of trees on the timberclaim . There would be the garden , chickens , and  | some milk cows to add to the seven head of cattle from doctor fees that she had running with Clarke 's herd now . But the cattlemen would not like this settling north of the river , or her fencing and irrigation . One of the first to be disturbed would be the Boslers , with their claim to a hundred and fifty miles of the north river front for their forty , fifty thousand head of stock . " That 's an empire too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their hired hands had pinned a crude sign , HORSE THIEF , to the chest of the surveyor 's helper they hanged at Sidney . Everybody said it was to scare his employer out of their free-land holdings . Turned out that the surveyor was an old Indian fighter and a pretty knotty piece of pitch pine . He immediately hired another man off the street , equipped him with a good rifle and finished the survey through all the Bosler range . But things like the hanging were to warn settlers off the free land up there , and now that the effect was plainly wearing off , it could happen again any time . " You mean they might hang me ? " Morissa had scoffed . " Not so long as you 're in good with Clarke and Tris Polk ? " " So ? ! I have to keep in good with them . And if they should find out something that destroys their respect for me ? " " Well , be better if they did n't . Rope do n't care whose neck it stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only an abstract rope . Yet he was compelled to say it , knowing too that Jackie must teach his sister something about the new Colt so she would be willing to carry it . Their talk that day had been interrupted by a soft tap on the door , almost as though one of Etty 's dogs had come nosing . It was Fish Head , the grease bucket containing his silk hat hanging from his arm , the little man looking very crestfallen to find Robin there . The father laughed . How could one think of necks stretched and proficiency with Colt 's Peacemaker while barefoot old Fish Head stood on the doorstep ? vi ON IIER RETURN FROM THE LAND OFFICE MORISSA KIRK FOUND Sidney stirred by something besides gold rumors . General Crook had met the hostile Sioux up in Montana and whipped them . " Yeah , the report says he whipped ' em , but I see he 's withdrawed to his camp . That do n't look like no victory to me , " Morissa heard one of the old Indian fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . They listened attentively , for they were waiting on the coach from the Hills , already long overdue . Not only did the gold trail pass within whooping distance of Red Cloud Agency but the entire region from south of there to Canada , including all the Black Hills , was legally Indian country , where no white man had the legal right to go . Those wilder northern Indians under Crazy Horse claimed the land clear to the Platte and the bridge and planned to hold it . Morissa said nothing of her homestead north of the river . She knew that the Indians harried the Cheyenne trail to Deadwood , not over fifty miles west of Clarke 's bridge , driving off horses and mules in spite of the Winchester guards and the troops , the Indians almost as troublesome as the outlaws . When the coach finally came in , the passengers from Red Cloud said that the Indians had kept the agency awake with their victory dances the last two nights . They claimed Crazy Horse whipped the pants off General Crook and they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Cloud , and old Red 's son was in the fight . " Here we 're feeding them dirty loafin ' Indians and their young bucks off killin ' our troops ! " the station master complained . Yes , and this morning the last of the young warriors vanished from the agency like fog before the sun . One party followed the stagecoach halfway to the Platte bridge and then cut in ahead , blocking the trail . The woman passenger was pushed down to the floor for protection but the driver was an old friend of Red Cloud 's and so the Indians parted , the warriors sitting their horses on both sides of the trail , blankets drawn up to their angry eyes as the coach galloped through . Then they whirled off northwest towards the Yellowstone country . But the escape still had some of the passengers feeling their scalps uneasily . " You better settle in town awhile , " the station manager advised Morissa . " You 're the only white woman for two hundred miles along the Platte . Be bad when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and afraid , with only the Peacemaker on the sod wall against the silent moccasin in the night , the tomahawk , the knife , and the bark of the rifle . " No , " she answered slowly . " I 'm the only doctor for those two hundred miles , " and handed her valises up . Guards were shifted from the gold coach to ride the regular north stage , empty today except for two ranchers hurrying to their beef herds , and Morissa Kirk . The other spaces had all been canceled , and for the next month . One of the special guards , the shotguns , riding inside said he was from the Cheyenne trail , but between the bloody Sioux and the roadagents , the stages there had stopped running by June . Only the largest freight outfits with troop escort could get through , everything else shifted to the Sidney trail , which ran cast of Robbers Roost and the Indians that headed north to the hostiles.  | With Crook 's large army defeated , the hungry agency Sioux , still something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like angry hornets and not over a hundred twenty miles from Sidney , only eighty from the hated Clarke bridge that brought so many goldhungry whites running into the Indian 's Black Hills unprotected . With the help of the northern hostiles they might certainly feel powerful enough to throw all the whites out of the region , including those of Deadwood itself , all the ten , fifteen thousand people , women and children , too , jammed into a pitch-pine gulch , ready for the fire stick and the scalp knife . The hurrying stage was met by Henry Clarke and his bookkeeper , Gwinn , near Courthouse Rock , Winchesters across their saddles , fieldglasses in their hands . They had caught no Indian sign , no signal , although several of Lorette 's relatives had slipped in for ammunition before going north . Clarke had wired Washington for troops to protect the bridge , although he was an old friend of the Sioux and usually more worried about white outlaws . " This time it wo n't do much good to hang up a dead owl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard and smiling . " Not against a Sioux war . " Fortunately Gwinn , who had cared for Tom Reeder in the wagon while Morissa was away , had avoided the questions about the strange silence at the bridge , and not a wagon crossing . Two days later a small dusty guard of troops came to pitch their tents at the north approach . The government had three armies out up north and was pushing the contractors to hurry some of their deficient deliveries to the hungry agencies , particularly Bosler , already under investigation for beef frauds . The next day , a prairie scorcher with the temperature above 100 , Morissa had to go up the trail to set a broken leg and help get the man down . She strapped on her Colt and as a special precaution she rode awhile beside a bull train going to Red Cloud and was almost overcome by the stink of it . " Salt pork fer them Sioux , " the whackers called to her . " An ' you better keep your gun oiled up , ma'am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to some buck 's belt . " Two ambulances of Army officers out to inspect the situation at Red Cloud Agency came through , and young Lieutenant Larman from the bridge was ordered to join their mounted escort . This looked like a good opportunity to get past the Sioux for a farewell Fourth of July excursion to Deadwood , Robin decided . It might be the last if the mines really were played out or , as likely , the hostile Indians eluded the troops up north and struck toward the settlements . Clarke was going up to strengthen the defenses of his stage stations and get his pony express  | established to the Black Hills mining camps . He sent tents and bed linen ahead for the guests and took Gwinn , the bookkeeper , along to ride the back of the special coach while a guard from the gold runs who had fought Indians sat up beside the driver , rifle across his knees . Jack and Robin would be horseback and Tris too . Morissa felt a little guilty that she had n't told the rancher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers of explanation on a buzzard 's neck plainly would make no eagle of forthrightness of him , or her . But Tris was bringing his Chicago guests along , the packer Hurley Forson , his vivacious daughter Yevette and her chaperon , her Aunt Clara , a fiery old feminist . While it did n't look like the time for a tenderfoot outing , Morissa knew it must be important to Tris and probably Clarke , too , and even Robin  --  a matter of large Eastern and British investments if the Indian scare could be discounted . This outing , if successful , seemed the way to do it . So she hired Charley Adams , a field nurse in the Civil War , from the bridge guard to look after her two patients , and tried to keep Tom Reeder from uneasiness . Even the antelope sensed something and ran back and forth at the garden fence while Morissa packed . The coach with the horsebackers following rumbled over the bridge soon after sunrise , close behind the two prairie ambulances of officers and the escort of bluecoats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off northward on the empty trail , with the meadowlarks still singing in the morning cool . But soon the heat drove the birds to pant in the shade of weeds or brush on the yellowed prairie as it did most of the larger game , although on a short cut an occasional antelope whistled , turning up the white of his rump as he ran , and then circled back in curiosity . There were almost no travelers and few freight outfits on the trail . Those few were very long , with mounted guards , rifles across their saddles , hurrying essential goods through while they could . Several horsebackers passed Clarke 's party , hoping good horseflesh would get them away in case of an Indian attack . Even these carried rifles now , almost no one trusting to the more ornamental Colt . But no one in Clarke 's coach mentioned the rumors , or any other unpleasantness . They saw no Indians up close except at a little huddle of tipis along the brushy White River bottoms , where two old men were out smoking beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even Aunt Clara , worn to silence by the heat and the long rough road , was ready for her bed when supper was done . Morissa dropped off wondering that Eddie Ellis was n't down to visit with jack , his dew-lashed blue eyes following her or certainly the handsome Yevette , young and boldeyed too . In the morning Lieutenant Larman came galloping down from the agency on a fresh horse , eager as a hungry man drawn to a coffee cooking .  | He had a nice six-day leave and could go all the way to Deadwood , and his young face flushed with pleasure as Yevette Forson cried , " Oh , Lieutenant , then you can keep us safe ! " Although Morissa suspected that he might be sent as protection , neither Robin nor even Clarke seemed uneasy , and now with five good shots in addition to the guard riding the box  --  six , counting Morissa who had been practicing at targets  --  they were probably safe enough . Four were on horseback , Jackie with his Colt , the rest , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The station keeper said there had been no Indian troubles up ahead in almost a week , and only an occasional brush with petty horse thieves and roadagents , usually close in to the Hills . The eighteen-year-old Yevette shuddered , and tied on her swathing of red veil , for the sun was really trying to a delicate complexion , did n't Morissa think so , particularly to a fair skin  --  looking critically through the layers of chiffon at the doctor 's brown cheeks . As the sun climbed hot and clear , Yevette kept up a mild , veil-eyed flirtation with the Lieutenant riding alongside , and with Gwinnie up behind and Jack and Tris , too , giving Morissa an occasional sweet and tolerant glance . She did not notice the strange badland formations that lay on both sides of the trail . From a distance the naked reaches of earth looked like the palms of mamriioth dying hands , cupped , yellowish , and withered . Upon approach the witherings became gullied canyons , bluffs , and buttes , with hundreds of little pinnacles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun bright as on snow , still and oven-hot on the coach , shining on no other moving thing . Finally they were out upon the high table with a ridge rising dark in the northwest , so blue-dark that Morissa knew it was the Black Hills , although to the left the yellow prairie still shimmered in mirage lakes , with little dry-land whirlwinds zigzagging idly across the plain , lifting bits of grass and leaves and then letting them drift . Far ahead the trail climbed over the rise of the prairie swells , a long bull train and the occasional faster travel like rows of crawling black specks . Inside the jolting coach the weary newcomers began to doze , their heads pillowed against each other in the heat and dust . Clarke let down the canvas curtain toward the afternoon sun , and settled back too , smiling companionably to Morissa as he closed his eyes for a little rest until the next change of teams . But suddenly half a dozen horsebackers rose up behind a low ridge to the left , moving parallel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatted heads , not Indians , unless they were disguised . The guard leaned down toward the window and spoke quietly , pointing . Clarke peered out beside the curtain . Morissa looked , too , and gripped her hands tight , for already Robin and the Lieutenant were turning down along a dry creek bed between the men and the coach . She tried  | to see Jackie , somewhere behind , but Tris came hurrying up . He held his horse as close as he could beside the flying wheels and silently handed his belt and holster in to Morissa . Their hands touch a moment , their eyes met . " Be careful ? " the young doctor whispered , her throat tight . But in a moment she calmed , and moving softly so none would be awakened , she drew the cartridge belt about her narrow waist and set the pistol ready under her hand . Outside , Tris balanced his rifle across the saddle and fell back to plan with Jackie . Morissa could see the boy now , riding without apparent concern over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only sign , and she marveled at her earlier doubts about a gun for a sixteen-year-old in this wild country . By now the driver was easing his six horses into a clattering run , gradually , without seeming to , but the men were spurring up , too , rising higher into sight , sending a couple of bullets into the trail before the coach , and apparently heading for a place where the ridge dipped toward a timbered creek and met the trail at a twisting , brushy crossing . The violent jolt and lurch of the coach had jerked Aunt Clara awake , too . She stared around with sleep-bloated , frightened eyes and grabbed at her brother and the others , all bracing themselves as they could . Then she took Yevette 's hand to comfort the girl , but when the guard sent a bullet to spurt a warning reply over the riding men she cried out at the thunder of the Winchester over her head . The packer stretched his thick neck , suddenly no longer red , to look out , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he tried to reassure the old woman . " Just blowing up a little powder , my dear . Fourth of July , you know . " The next bullet , from Gwinnie 's rifle , hit a little closer to the riders coming much faster now , sure to cut the coach off at the crossing . Then Robin started to use his rifle against them , firing from down in the dry bed , the bullets sending up warning puffs of earth and dust before the horses but almost under their feet now . The men swung out a little from this rising fire and then Morissa realized that they probably had accomplices at the crossing and planned to strike the trail beyond there , cut off the stage 's escape . Robin and Lieutenant Larman sent them a few more shots while Tris and Jack cut in past the rocking coach for the creek . Then suddenly a rider rose out of a gully and charged for the crossing . There was a quick movement in the brush before the coach , a shaking and plunging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoot . Smoke puffed out blue and he spurred ahead to Jackie 's shout . She closed her eyes a second for courage and then drew the heavy Colt and steadied it against the edge of the swaying window , waiting for the first highwayman to step out into the road . As she braced herself for this killing , the driver sent the  | coach plunging down toward the creek close upon Tris and Jack . The top-heavy vehicle swayed dangerously to left and then right as it took the turn and dip into the timber and the broad muddy crossing . Yevette sobbed in fright against Clarke 's shoulder and Aunt Clara was thrown against Morissa and her gun , and prayed aloud as dirty water splashed in over them and bullets whistled past . But the driver did not stop . Feet braced , he cut right and left with his whip , skillfully holding his six galloping horses together , and so the coach righted itself and was up on the far bank with a lurch . There was more running in the brush , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach was out on the bottoms and the horses settled into a lathered panting trot , up in plain sight of a big freight outfit barely half a mile away . Behind them the pursuing riders had stopped and were bunched together , apparently looking , while a man afoot near the crossing emptied his futile pistol after the stage , one spent bullet striking the body like a sharp hailstone . Gwinnie picked it out of the wood and tossed it in to Clarke . Aunt Clara cried out when he put the mushroomed pellet , still hot , into her palm . " Did you see Tris drop the horse of the outlaw that was beating us to the crossing ? " Gwinnie called out . " But that stray cow running through the brush sure had me scared ? " Morissa laughed in foolish relief . By now the roadagents seemed discouraged . They headed into the creek bed and up toward the dark canyons of the Hills that looked near enough to touch . Morissa sighed . The next time roadagents or Indians appeared , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenderfeet . But Forson the packer was still busy . Wiping a handkerchief over his sun-blistered face he tried to quiet his sister 's demand that she be taken right back to her private car down on the tracks at Sidney . Now finally Yevette was excited enough to forget the sun . With her veil thrown back she leaned out to thank the Lieutenant . Oh , he was so splendid , so brave . Jackie , too , was riding taller as he came up to look in on Morissa . " We 'd a give it to ' em ! " he said , slapping his gun , his boy-face gaunt with excitement , so strained and taut with it that Morissa wanted to cry . " Perhaps it was somebody who saw us around Red Cloud station last night , " Clarke said quietly , stroking his reddish beard . " Or one of those outfits usually after fatter game , before the Indians and the troops got so thick around the Robbers Roost that the stages quit running through there . Dune Blackburn perhaps , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been easier picking there 'd been trouble . That 's the indisputable advantage of our prairie route , " Clarke told Forson , with his persuasive businessman 's way . " Only a few spots are fit for daytime holdups  | on this trail . But that outfit worked mighty fast if it was this special coach they were after . " The way he said it , with a little unmirthful laughing in his thick beard , made Morissa look after the men , recalling something that seemed familiar in the way one of them rode . Clarke 's laugh suggested it , but perhaps he meant her protest over the man hanged at the bridge that first day and was enjoying these few shots in her direction . Or was it Clarke they were after , now that the Indians could be blamed ? Then Morissa remembered something else  --  that Jack had asked last week if Eddie Ellis could come along , so Ed must have known and through him perhaps Fly Speck or any of half a dozen other roadagents hiding out among Red Cloud 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of Clarke : " You think they were a little easy to drive off ? ? " looking under his palm all around the prairie and back toward the Sioux agency . Uneasy , Morissa settled herself to quiet the aunt . She poured a little camphor into a handkerchief and cooled the woman 's brow . Yevette needed no easing . She had a hero . They got through by taking every man who could be spared from the stage stations and so , with five armed guards , they pulled into the packed and noisy gulch of Deadwood as the last sun left the timbered peaks . The gold town was in deep shadow , lights glowing suddenly here and there from the log and slab and canvas structures jammed along both sides of the little Main Street , scarcely wide enough for the bull trains to pass the fast evening carriages of the fancy women . The street was really choked where the placer mine in the middle of it narrowed thc moving streams , the crowded horses tangling in their fright at the pop of firecrackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plodding on . The gulch walls climbed steeply from the string town , shacks leaning one over the other far up on each side . Robin had arranged for a tworoom log house many rough steps above the noise of the town , but more private than the bunk-rowed hotels . The girls and Aunt Clara had the larger room , with a stove to take off the mountain chill and to heat bath water for the tub that was a whisky barrel sawed in half and set behind a sheet hung across a corner . Yevette complained , wondering how she would manage without a maid for the evening toilette . But she did very well , chattering about her brave lieutenant all the time as she kohled her eyes behind Aunt Clara 's back , skillfully setting off their handsome darkness and the whiteness of her skin , although it was pinkened a little by the wind , even through the veil .  | Aunt Clara managed to forget her alarm at the popping firecrackers and ate well of the hurried dinner brought in . Then they went down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle . The Belle was a log theater and dance hall , with a bar , gambling tables , a stage , and twenty curtained boxes across the back behind the audience . Two of the boxes were opened together , the cots removed , and chairs brought , and the curtains looped back for a view of the stage for Tris and his party , the rancher 's amused face confirming what Morissa suspected  --  that these were the cribs of the girls working the place . The crowd was largely muddy-booted miners and other hopefuls , so like those waiting at the bridge the day Morissa first came . They pushed in and out under the smoky lanterns , milled around the bar and the gambling tables with the gold scales still busy weighing dust . Morissa noticed that Huff Johnson was at one , and making a good showing . The sleeves of his snowy white shirt were turned back from his delicate wrists , his black brocade vest buttoned close about his narrow waist , his mustache elegantly trimmed . But he had a new granite stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross 's gay words , and Morissa knew why Huff had moved away from the bridge and why Tris Polk had taken so long to deliver his beef herd at Deadwood . She realized that in these Victorian times to let such conduct be known might seem reprehensible , and an insult to her , when Tris had asked her to marry him so recently . Perhaps it was part of him as a Texan  --  like the young medical student from Georgia who argued so hotly that the slave girl was an indispensable part of a gentleman 's education , and the preservation of Southern womanhood . As the crowd grew , Robin noticed a few army deserters around , troopers who had guarded the railroad tracks against the Indians . They told him that half a company had deserted General Custer last month on his march west to the Yellowstone . The gold pan looked a lot better than the scalping Sioux . Henry Clarke was greeted by an old acquaintance , too , the blondbearded , loud-voiced General Dawson , who came into Deadwood when there was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankers and mine financiers around and Clarke took Forson over to join them . If the mines were done , certainly nobody here at the Golden Belle was admitting it . " Everybody 's got to be seen here at the Belle at least once an evening , " Robin said . " Even the sheriff , who knows the gun 's still the law . " Many of the more flamboyant men and women were from the other houses along the gulch , the elaborately gowned women with their pomaded escorts beside them , like Madame Volanda who had crossed the bridge with her girls that first day . Wild Bill Hickok was there , too , at a corner table , his shining hair tumbling over his shoulders . A dozen  | smooth-fingered gunmen strolled through the crowd , and a scattering of roadagents , even Fly Speck Billy . Speck gave it the final touch for Morissa  --  the whole crowd not very different from that around the bridge before the opening , except that here they were not waiting to cross over to anywhere ; here they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle had a small orchestra , and a square piano of carved rosewood on the little stage for the variety acts . The program included a farce playette , a little minstrel troupe , and the Flora-Dora Trio , three plump and close-laced dancing girls in bare shoulders and hip-length black stockings that would have shocked Aunt Clara if she had n't been dozing , her charge , Yevette , concerned with her lieutenant . The last act was by a dark , foreign-looking accompanist , very indifferent at the piano , and a pale blond singer , pretty in a sad and worn way . I Icr light voice was almost lost in the celebrating and pistol shots and the noise of the crowd drifting past . A quiet , gray-haired man pushed through to the stage and in the midst of the spatter of applause , lifted a gun and fired twice , missing both times . The accompanist ducked behind the piano , but the shots and the smoke were barely noticed by anyone except the owner . He came flailing through from the bar , shouting " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine instrument ! " There was one more shot , this time from the accompanist . The gray man held himself very erect a moment and then sagged to the floor as the crowd parted around him . The singer cried out and ran to him . " Oh , my darling , my darling ? " she sobbed as the man lifted a hand to touch her . " Stop him , " the wounded man pleaded weakly of the faces looking curiously down upon him . " He stole my wife . Do n't let him get away ? " By now Morissa found herself there too . Automatically she had elbowed forward , with Tris steadying her . " He 's about gone ? " The accompanist was brought down by two bearded miners and held there facing the singer across the man he had shot , the warm pistol forgotten in his hand until it was taken from him . A long time the wounded husband stared up at him . " Bring a priest ? " he urged weakly of the silenced crowd . " Marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Morissa had to see the husband die , the killer be pushed up beside the dazed and silent woman , hear a priest speak the words : " Do you take ? " the voice quiet but addressed to the sunburnt and bearded crowd and their scattering of women  --  all hushed for the moment . Afterward a man from the orchestra sprang up on the stage and began Mendelssohn 's Wedding March . Then he remembered the dead man almost at his feet and let his hands sink , the piano die . Without seeming to move , the crowd parted for the newly married , let them walk down the soiled , smoky path toward the door .  | Morissa gripped her nails into her palms . At least her mother had been spared this indignity to the betrayed , this final violation of the spirit . But the young doctor knew she must shake off this morbid and sickly preoccupation , must not keep running down this worn path like a mouse in a wagon rut . It was very late when Morissa got Aunt Clara quieted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she demanded over and over . She made a real fuss when she discovered that there was no lock on the door . " No locks anywhere around , ma'am , " Tris laughed when Morissa called him to ease the old woman 's mind . " No petty crimes here in the West . We rob ' em in the open , or kill ' em , as you see , but that 's all . " Speechless , the woman tried to move the washstand against the door . Tris did it , and piled the chairs and the tub there too , and climbed out the window that was held in place by one big nail . Afterward Morissa heard ' him start down the long steps to the town . She thought of Gilda Ross , and the jealous eyes and itchy trigger finger of Huff Johnson . Next morning all of Clarke 's party was out in time for the Centennial Independence Day celebration , with bunting , whipping banners and rifle salutes , the orchestra from the Golden Belle a band for the hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing in the wind , read the Declaration of Independence and electioneered a little for Hayes . " A gr-r-reat Republican for a gr-r-reat nation beginning her second hundred years ! " he shouted over the sunburnt faces turned up to him , his voice thrown back in echo from the gulch walls . There were some answering shouts for Tilden from the jobless , but nobody could vote here in the Indian country anyway , and so the general read a memorialization to Congress : " We petition that august body for speedy and prompt action in extinguishing the Indian title to the country we are occupying and improving ? " Morrisa watched the crowd line up to sign the petition , mostly men , more under their twenties than over them , and everybody signing the great roll of paper , even the Chinese , Negroes , and old Swill Barrel Johnny , a brother in spirit to Fish Head of the Platte bridge . " Twentyfive thousand people around here , " a loud-mouth offered easily , " but likely we wo n't need that petition . Custer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be givin ' us no more hot powder . " As the crowd moved off to wet their gullets , Tris led his party over to see the new Black Hills jewelry . The clerk thrust aside a lot of idle lookers from the little showcase and helped everybody get a souvenir of Deadwood . When Morissa shook her head to Tris , he urged her gently . " ? Just a remembrance of a pleasant outing , " saying it sadly , with something autumnal in his voice , something final , and the girl wondered if  | he might be joining Forson 's packing firm , or taking up with Gilda Ross for good . So she selected a ring : a greenish vine to circle the little finger , with a bunch of reddish grapes and a handsome green gold leaf . Afterward Robin took the Lieutenant and Yevette and Jackie to see the gold bricks in the bank window and then to pan a little gold dust for themselves at a friend 's diggings . The rest went with Tris along Main Street , Morissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and gold parasol that made her eyes browner , her flushed cheeks ruddy as a child 's under the sun boiling down into the narrow and crowded gulch . At Number 10 Saloon a woman in a bedraggled dress leaning against the wall stopped them as they tried to push past . " Well , if it ai n't Trish Polk , you old son of a gun ! " she shouted thickly . " How 's about buyin ' a lady a drink ? " So , to the amusement of the Chicago packer and the increasing delicacy of his sister 's thin lips , Tris introduced the woman . " The famous Calamity Jane , " he told them , " well known around Sid ! Icy , Cheyenne and Deadwood Gulch ? " But when he spoke Morissa 's name , Calamity leaned closer and with the occasional acuteness of the drunk , recalled something from long ago . " Kirk ? You say Morisha Kirk ? " she cried . With a staggering step forward she held out a small , dirty hand . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Once more the hated word was like a slap across the face to the young doctor , her angry flush plain to everyone in the bright mountain sunlight , and with everybody watching , for Calamity Jane was on the howl and had her grab hooks in some city dudes . Grinning in expectation , they stood around to savor the mortification Calamity could cause by her sodden , dissolute face , the unkempt hair , the voice like a roaring bull elk's. 1 ? ncouraged by so much attention she tried to hold it , extend it . Wavering a little she began a childhood chant , swaying as she tried a umping step and had to grab for the saloon wall . But she still held out one hand to detain Tris and his friends . " You remember it , Issy Kirk , lumping rope , do n't you ? " she demanded of Morissa , and began again : " Ish  --  Issy over the ocean , Issy over the sea ? " laughing very hard at her okc . " You met Dr. Kirk before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , to relieve Morissa 's mortification and ease his guests away . Calamity stopped . " Doc ? Did he say doe ? " she shouted . " So you 're a dealin ' in corn plasters an ' snake oil stead teachin ' school like you was planuin ' back in Missouri ? " Now it was up to Morissa . " Yes , sometimes I can cure corns , " she managed to say pleasantly enough , " although I have n't had much practice  | handling the snakes ? " and was immediately ashamed of the poor joke , the unprofessional taunt . But the crowd roared . " Calamity knows about them there snakes all right ! " some one yelled , and Jane joined in the laughing , happy to be part of it on any terms . So Tris slipped her a gold piece and moved his friends away , and later , on a grassy spot up the placer-roiled little creek , the talk turned to Calamity . Evidently the Canary family really had gone West when they left the Princeton region , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane in the red velvet bodices that she had envied so much in her childhood , when she was the barefoot , poor-farm child . Now Martha Jane was this sodden , unfortunate creature in an ugly little gulch town surrounded by mountains that were gophered through by the goldhungry  --  a broken , miserable woman at twenty-six . Once the young doctor wanted to jump up and run to find her , tell her that there were cures for this illness , to come down to the bridge and she , a genuine doctor , would care for her . But instead Morissa sat demure with her white ruffles spread about her and listened to Tris tell his guests the newspaper tales about Calamity sneaking in among Crook 's soldiers and scouting for him , when she was really found drunk among his mule skinners and sent right back . There was a story , too , that she saved a colonel 's life , when all the colonel ever heard of her was that she might have been one of the predatory women he drove from his camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little lectures on the new Women 's Christian Temperance Union and the need for woman suffrage . " Give us the weapon and we will banish the Demon Rum ! " she cried with her best elocutionist 's gestures , but not at their most effective from a seat on a rotten old log beside a creek in Deadwood Gulch , the elocutionist 's nose peeling from sunburn . Tris nodded and exchanged a grin with the packer and Morissa . " Clara 's been a good mother to Yevette since my wife died , " Hurley Forson told the young doctor afterward , " but she does coddle her notions . " Morissa smiled in preoccupation . Everybody coddled a notion or two of his own , an illusion , good or bad , but today one that had tinged all her values since childhood had been shaken , brought down , and somehow the fall of Martha Jane Canary left an ugly place , like an oak 's fall that suddenly exposed all the sad , stunted growth within its shadow , naked and mean , as naked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine . It was Gwinnie hurrying out with a carriage to fetch them that broke up the outing . It seemed more than just the prearranged conveyance to a gay early supper before a big evening , and so it turned out . The young  | man managed a word with Tris , and later the rancher came , seriousfaced , to speak low to Morissa . Trouble , he said . A rider from the Red Cloud stage station came to warn Clarke that the Indians claimed Custer 's whole regiment was wiped out up in the Yellowstone country . Already a couple of Seventh Cavalry carbines taken up there had been sneaked in to the agency Sioux . " Wiped out ? " Morissa whispered . " You mean killed ? " " Yes , claim every man was killed by the Sioux . We better try to get back down while we can . No telling when the Indians decide to strike our bridge and cut the trail running right past their noses . There may be raids all over as soon as the northern warriors start the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bloody pitch . Besides , when the news gets out here there 'll be panic  --  these tenderfeet stampeding like longhorns in a thunderstorm , and we have to keep you and the Forsons out of that . " " Does the Army know ? " Morissa asked , looking over to the dapper young Lieutenant Larman with Yevette . " Rumors , probably , but if there was more , the Lieutenant would be on his way back to the bridge hard as he could ride . " The party made a short evening of it , not going to hear the English twupe 's Mikado , as they had planned . Because Yevette got an hour ulnae with her lieutenant in the mountain moonlight she was happy . Aunt Clara began to snore softly at the supper table . " It 's the mountain air . " the doctor consoled her and put the old woman to bed for a nap and then did not waken her . It was late when Morissa heard the men come in , Tris after the others . They started back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main street of Deadwood Gulch was almost empty except for that placer mine set in the middle , and the trash , papers , and bunting from the celebration scattered around . Here and there a drunk was sleeping in the gray dust , and two who would never awaken were laid out beside a saloon . In an hour the wagons , the long bull trains , would be moving through the narrow street , and all the jam of a boom that still seemed alive . But in an hour or a day the Custer news would explode like the caches of mine dynamite hidden around the gulch . The driver hurried them out past the last scattered diggings and slump land , past a man sitting on a rock with a rifle across his knee , guarding a little hole in the ground , probably something like the one where Tom Reeder made his strike . For a moment Morissa thought of him , but Tom was safe at the bridge , his gold in the station , or so it was five days ago . She wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Were the Sioux really powerful enough to throw all the whites out of their treaty  | grounds if they tried ? The frontier would run red , as some predicted , and many innocent ones on both sides would die . Although no one had told Aunt Clara anything , or Yevette , unless the grave-faced young Lieutenant knew , the two were silent , uncomplaining , their weary heads nodding with the jerk of the coach . Morissa was very tired too , and the ammunition belt very heavy about her waist , the last cartridge loop filled , her mind numb with the bald final instructions from Clarke and the extra guards , and Hurley Forson , too , in case the coach was ambushed , overrun . This time there would be no stops for sleep . Somehow they must endure the drive straight through as on the regular stage run , with horses and men changed regularly , everything changed except the coach and the passengers . If it seemed best they could hide out in the bluffs and badlands and then go past Red Cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indians would n't attack at night . They had an old , old notion that night fighting was bad luck , perhaps because the dew stretched the bowstrings and softened their moccasin soles . But it would not soften the hoofs of their war ponies , or the blast of the Winchesters smuggled to them the last year under the freight loads going through , paid for by pony herds they later claimed were stolen . Or the new weapons taken from Custer 's men . No one in the coach unless it was the Forson women thought of the roadagents now . Once Morissa looked around to the riders that included all the family she had  --  Robin and Jackie , yes , and Tris , too , and then to these people inside the stagecoach , all so vulnerable to lead and fire and the scalping knife . Then she pillowed her head on her arm and dozed off , not awakening to the jolt or jerk of the hurrying coach . VII THE WEARY TRAVELERS LOOKED DOWN INTO THE NORTH PLATTE valley , serene , an eagle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight outfits camped below the bridge , and a trail herd pulling in from the south , like a string of brown ants moving under their dust and hurrying faster as they smelled the water . Even Aunt Clara relaxed a little , easing her aching old bones as well as she could . And as Morissa saw the bridge standing so quietly over the rising sand bars , with three horsebackers , an Indian and his two women , fording the shallow stream  | from Etty 's and plodding away northward , she wanted to laugh at the promise Hurley Forson had extracted from her as they left Deadwood ? to save the last three shells from her cartridge belt for his daughter , his sister , and herself . They had come down the whole trail and seen no Indian except a few more old men sitting out beside the road smoking ; one of them lifted his left hand in greeting , or perhaps in protest as the fast coach spread its dust over them . True , there were troops out everywhere now , a whole army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many stationed where the old lodgepole trail to the north crossed near the Robbers Roost country . But probably the earlier discontinuance of the Cheyenne stagecoaches had already driven men like Dune Blackburn away to the Sidney trail . If it was really his outfit that followed Clarke 's special coach , they were lucky as weasels in a hen coop to get away . But there was some of the panic that Tris Polk had foreseen when the news of Custer 's fight got out . In a diffused form it spread over the entire region from Texas to the Milk River and the Cannonball . In the hills and down the trail a lot of dispossessed roadagents , general hideouts from the law , and a few discouraged miners and scouts organized the Montana Volunteers , to join General Crook , they said , but perhaps mainly to show off around Deadwood , where , forgetting that they were all trespassers on Indian lands , a committee had posted a bounty of $125 each for Indian scalps . Buffalo Bill Cody heard about the Volunteers and hurried up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Clarke 's , talking big in words he had learned from his New York manager . He handed out photographs of himself in beaded buckskin , and for once Morissa saw a man who was as handsome as he was pictured . And up in Deadwood flour was selling at fifty cents a pound . The Custer annihilation affected the north valley , too , as Morissa had discovered when their coach rolled to a stop at Clarke 's . Tom Reeder had pulled on his pants and quit the place . As soon as he heard about the Custer fight he bought another horse from Etty , got his gold at the stage station and with old Fish Head to drive , he started for Sidney and the railroad . Morissa had stretched at her weariness from the long trip . " Why , the old dead beat ! So he jumped his doctor bill ? " she said , humoring the station hands in what she considered their little joke . " I guess two months was all of our tame company he could stand . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note and a package with the station master for the doe . The note was written with a lead bullet on a paper sack :  | im taken my stuff an pullen out and im taken the antlop so i won be lonsom tom reeder The package was a little rawhide bag . Morissa poured the contents out into her palm  --  gold nuggets , looking curiously like warm and shining beans , mostly with the same bent shape only a great deal heavier . " Oh , he 'll get killed for his gold sure , " Morissa exclaimed as though of a child . " He probably never got to Sidney . " But Clarke 's old station hand shook his head and unloaded his cud into the sandbox . " Oh , I guess he 's made it all right , Miss Morissy , " he said as he wiped his yellow mustache . " Tom , he sent his treasure box down by stage , expressed it straight to the bank . " A rueful smile pulled at Morissa 's wind-chapped lips . " So he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was wise for him to go . Reeder was a sick man and now he could get the care that might help keep him alive a while longer . She would miss the antelope , although he had grown large enough to jump the fence into the yard and the flowers . Before Morissa could get to bed , a cowboy rode up , speaking apologetically . A man was took sick with typhoid down at Redington 's on Pumpkin Seed Creek , south of the Wild Cat range . " Oh , I just ca n't go now , " Morissa protested wearily . " Not without some sleep . We 've come straight through from Deadwood . I 'm just not fit to care for a patient . " " He 's took pretty bad , ma'am , mebby dyin ' ? " the cowboy said slowly . " Them Sidney does wo n't come ; got typhoid down there , too , an ' afraid of Indians . We borried us a wagon from Clarke 's ; got it ready with a bedroll spread in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . " So Morissa tried to shake the pall of weariness from her . " Give me half an hour to clean up and get my pill sack together ? " Two days later Morissa had the man in her soddy , working to lower the fever and keep a little soft but nourishing food in him . She tried the less drastic of the new remedies for disinfecting the intestinal tract , afraid of the caustic carbolic dosages . While Charley Adams sat beside the sick man , Morissa had gone over the bridge and with a plat in her hand that she unrolled here and there , she sought out the almost obliterated government corners of her land . Then she decided on the site of her new home , on the second bottom , well out of reach of such floods as the one that welcomed her first day here , yet not too deep to water . There she set the stakes for the house , in the V made by the river and the trail  --  two streams that crossed , the  | stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would put down her roots and , she hoped , grow like the occasional towering cottonwood of the region . But some grew into stunted , curious dwarfs that never reached beyond three , four feet , and there seemed no accounting for why a tree here became the one or the other . The next morning Robin set his breaking plow into the virgin earth for the home of the first settler north of the river . He cut the sod in a low place where it was still moist enough this hot July to roll flat from the breaker bottom , although a little too low for the tightest mat of rooting . Even so , Morissa did n't plan to use this house for the thirty , forty years that a good sod building would stand up . As Robin 's plow turned the dark strips , smooth and shining , blackbirds followed close at his dragging whip , gobbling up bugs and worms . I Iis sweating men cut the sod into manageable lengths with their spades , stacked the slabs carefully on the platformed wagon gears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a foundation of stone from the Wild Cats . It would be a long building , set directly across the line between Morissa 's preemption and homestead , to serve as residence first for the one and then for the other . " It do n't take long to get onto the tricks of any trade , I guess ? " Robin said . " The land is good , and I intend to have as much as anyone else would get ? " the girl said firmly , and Robin remembered that her great grandfather had stolen the wife he wanted , carried her off to the Highlands , and kept her shut up until she learned to love him enough to reload his guns as he held off the brothers come for her . In two days the door casings of Morissa 's house stood up stark as play entrances to an imaginary dwelling . Wide double-window spaces were set in , with deep ledges for sunny winter seats , and for pots of flowers to brighten the dark months . Long , straight pines were dragged out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridge poles , and for the stable and the windmill tower later . But long before the last rattlesnake seemed gone from the gentle slope , and the walls were high as a branding corral , visitors showed up , to hunch with forearms crossed on their saddle horns and perhaps spit a little tobacco juice into the yellowing grass . " Pretty big spread you puttin ' up here , ma'am , " one said to Morissa . " Plannin ' to marry you a ready-made family ? " " Oh , I do n't know . The house wo n't be as big as the one up the river at Coads ' , I hear . But I can always add on if I need the room . " " Who 's gon na stand off the Indians ? " " They 'll get more guns and everything by attacking the trail station and the ranches than me . Besides , the troops are stationed on my side of the river ? "  | Sometimes a cowpuncher would get out his makin 's , sift the tobacco into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plannin ' on runnin ' cattle ? " " Yes , some , " the girl usually said to this query . She had ten cows , or twelve  --  whatever the number happened to be , and planned to get more , since cattle were easier for patients to come by here than money . But she would need all this space to care for the sick . " No telling when there 'll be a typhoid epidemic with the water problem so serious all along the trail . Besides the victims of Indian raids . " When the visitors spurred away , they usually left a hazy sense of unfriendliness behind , like the thin smoking of dust raised by their dogloping horses in the summer heat . Morissa realized that this unfriendliness would grow when the ten acres were broken out for her treeclaim next spring , and her little irrigation ditch was started . Then the new Centennial Model Winchester rifle came . Robin opened the box casually . " Guess maybe I better leave this here with you , if you persist in staying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered for Morissa . And once more he saw the firmness come to the chin of his stepdaughter , just as the day he asked their doctor to tell her how difficult her life would be as a female sawbones . He had known she would stay , at least for a while , and so he settled his hat closer to his shaggy gray hair and went to lay out a target , clearing a square yard of sand on the slope of a ridge where the heavy .45-70 bullets could bury themselves , not kill stock or perhaps a man far beyond the reach of sound . Then he showed Morissa how to use the new rifle and got Jackie to challenge her every few days . At first the gun left her shaken , not the recoil against her shoulder or the thunder in her ears , but the thought that she was practicing for murder . Yet she would soon be alone here , with helpless patients in her sole care , and so she kept on , until it became almost a game . Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the saloons to watch this young city woman with a ribbon on the heavy braid down her back kick up the sand every shot . Then they hurried back to throw down a few fast drinks . Morissa had a team and top buggy now , sent up by Sid Martin . He was no longer yellow as a Deadwood Chinaman , he wrote , but still fighting the saddle skirts around his neck instead of riding them . Otherwise he was doing all right for a man who ought to be dead , except that his whiskers itched like the mange inside that leather . Maybe he had sand fleas . One of the ranch hands brought the buggy to the doctor 's yard gate , untied his saddle horse from alongside the team and left the outfit there , the buggy and harness shining new under the thin dust , the bays standing  | with their ears up as Morissa came out and shying a little from her blowing calico skirts . But the mare reached out a soft , inquiring nose to the low words Morissa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said to the man as she rubbed the velvety little gully under the mare 's jaw . But he made it clear he was n't sent for conversation . He handed Morissa the letter from inside his shirt , swung into the saddle , and set his spurs . Nellie and Kiowa were four-year-olds , the gelding a little too faunching and flighty , but perhaps he would quiet down , or could be replaced by one better fitted for a doctor who dozed off returning from night calls . Besides Morissa found him an amusing horse . He might pass an old tarp flapping against a thistle without lifting an ear and then plunge sideways , snorting and rearing , at any hoptoad that blinked in his path . And it was as well that he was an engrossment , for Morissa needed something to laugh at , something to arouse a little of the Scottish humor her Grandmother Kirk was said to possess . She missed Robin and Jackie very much , even though some of the grading crew still worked around her place , fencing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thirsty gophers and field mice , even snakes who would only die in its depths . They threw a little dam across the thread of creek that probably roared with water in the springtime , and laid out a ditch down to her yard . Morissa knew she would n't get much water this year unless there was a cloudburst , but she wanted to utilize the plow and scraper crew while she had them . Robin was gone to look over his new job before moving down , and Jackie was visiting with Eddie Ellis up at Red Cloud among the surly Indians . But what disturbed Morissa was word that the boys were seen with the outlaws hiding around the agency . She thought of Grandmother Kirk . " A kinsman is part of your body but a foster brother is a piece of your heart , " she once wrote to the girl at the poor-farm , hoping to comfort this child that she could never acknowledge . Now the granddaughter knew what she had meant , with Jackie half kinsman and half beloved foster brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of travel past her new place thinned to a dry wash , the typhoid patient improving , the man with the broken leg up on crutches and gone to Sidney . Tris Polk had not stopped in since she crossed to the north side of the river and even Etty 's small daughters drew back with something more than shyness when she approached . Then the young doctor lost another patient , her first here north of the river , and never really hers . Yet somehow it put as much defeat upon her heart as the little girl with the snake bite . As Dr. Aiken at medical school once told her : " Perhaps women make had physicians . Their emotions involve them in the simplest physickMg. "  | Morissa had been to a beef camp down the river to see about a man thrown when his cutting horse hit a wet spot . On the way home she passed a covered wagon drawn up neat the bridge , a woman out in the shade , the baby in her lap choking and blue  --  perhaps whooping cough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man standing futilely by and unhooked her saddle pill bag . But the woman lifted her voice against her coming . " No female doser will work her spell on my son ! " Ashamed that she had thrust herself so unprofessionally into this rebuff , Morissa swung back into her saddle , shouting instructions to the father as she let out her prancing horse . Next morning she found the man at her door with his hat between his hands , asking that she come to say a few words at the burying . " ? The missus is sayin ' may-like you got you some book larnin ' , " he stammered . " Seein 's you set yourself up a-dosin ' . " Yes , enough book learning to bury her son now that he was dead , Morissa wanted to cry out . But she went . Standing beside the mother she read once more from the little bridal prayer book and wished that she had another white cashmere shawl to wrap about a child , another bit of her trousseau turned to some purpose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small beds in her sod house and a glassed-in space where sick children could grow strong , and sad ones happy  --  hoping somehow to discover them in time to restore them to health , to laughter , and to wonder . People around the bridge and the trail workers all knew that Tris Polk had not tied his horse at Morissa 's gate since Robin cut the first sod north of the river . Gradually the story of Calamity Jane 's school days with the young doctor , and who could tell what later association , sifted down from Deadwood . The men repeated it , letting it spread like a well-thrown loop , scratching their beards appreciatively , speculatively , or resetting their hats to their eyes . " Yeh , things is clearing off a little , " the Bosler wagon boss said in one of the whisky stores . " Might have known she was settin ' up in Calamity 's business over there , a young woman wanting to bunk alone like that ? " Some of the more speculative went beyond listening ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently acquaintance with Calamity did n't mean professional sisterhood , for they came back looking mighty sheepish . One who had primed his courage a little too much before he went complained the doe pulled a gun on him . " One of them new Winchester 's with a slug like your thumb ? " Most of those who lived at the bridge shook their heads knowingly for another reason . With Robin gone , the city girl would soon be clearing  | out too . Not even the roughest old widowwoman was willing to come into the region as cook , if any ranch would have a woman . Certainly the lady doc would go flying East before the first puff of blizzard wind , her new sod walls left as a rubbing place for the lousy longhorns . But for the present Morissa Kirk seemed to be making a great busyness of her move into the new house , bringing her barrel chair with its wheel bumbershoot , and her flowers and shrubs , laying out the new yard and gardens for next year . Besides , Lt. Wilbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness toward Morissa now that Yevette I ' Orson and Tris both seemed gone . Wilbert understood about caste from his West Point training , he told Robin on the Deadwood trip , and knew how far out of reach a millionaire packer 's daughter was to a poor shavetail . One weekend Morissa went to a post dance down at Camp Sidney with him . Wilbert had educated feet , as Sid Martin called them , and she would have had a good time except that she saw Tris Polk riding through a side street early in the evening . He was going somewhere in a hurry sitting the white-stockinged Cimarron with the ease to break the heart . But the Lieutenant was still a boy and with him she need not be a woman , only a laughing girl . Saturday nights they usually looked in at Etty 's roadhouse for a while , watching Lorette 's breed relatives from the trail stations and up around Red Cloud . The girls were creatures of flying grace in the square dances , the reels , and the polkas and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much hilarity and fun . There were usually two or three white women who had stopped in off the trail , generally showing the wear of Deadwood or similar places . Once Morissa noticed a very childish plump and pretty blond girl dancing with Eddie Ellis , but a little unsteadily and tiring much too soon . Although a schottische left her panting , her face red and perspirationstreaked , her eyes still turned to the pack of men along the walls and looking in the doors and windows . " She 's after one of the tenderfoot bridge hands that Clarke fetched West , " Eddie whispered to Morissa in a promenade . " Seems she 's carryin ' his bastard ? " Anger came up in Morissa 's flushed face . " Do n't defile the innocent ' inborn with that name ! " she said hotly , and the baffled twenty-year-old could only say , " You 're sure a looker when you 're mad , " and finish the dance in silence , his baby-lashed eyes searching out Morissa 's , until she wondered in exasperation how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Wilbert and Eddie hanging around when there were so many men in the country , not only Tris Polk , but dozens of others . The next morning someone came for Morissa . The yellow-haired girl had taken on too much of Etty 's red-eye last night and now she was  | behind the station outhouse among the tansy with her wrists cut . But when Morissa reached the bloodied spot the girl was gone . It was Fish Head who found her , crawled away behind a stunted willow clump at the river 's edge , face down in the clear shallow water that washed her long pale hair out full length , like some lovely golden sea growth moving restlessly over the sand . As Morissa had suspected , the girl was pregnant ; not over fifteen or sixteen years old and already in her seventh month under the cruel lacings . In her little bag was a gay note to her father , saying she was going away to make her fortune singing and dancing at Deadwood , and she would return with a pocket full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot July days the father was at the bridge , a tall graying man in black . It was too late ; the girl had been buried over on the knoll , with only Etty 's Lorette to mourn and tell her beads . But the father had anticipated that and brought an embalmer so his child could be returned to the family plot . He spoke angrily of the violence of this dreadful and lawless country , where a man 's guileless young daughter could be killed and none brought to justice , and when Morissa finally made him listen to the truth and its circumstances , he rose up in anger . " You are traducing an old and honorable name , madam ! " But later she saw him with his head in his hands beside the river while the undertaker worked in a little tent set up at the graveside . Her heart was heavy for the father , and for his lovely child . There seemed no limit to the misery a man might be willing to trade for a moment 's gratification . She wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who seduced her . " Ah , the urgent lover is soon gone with the geese ? " she once said , and never more than that . The new rifle hung on Morissa 's wall , but she seldom used it unless coyote or wolf came too close to her half-dozen white hens . Guns here had many purposes besides the hunt : on the range against a coyote or gray wolf attacking new calves , against a charging longhorn , or in a stampede ; socially they served as decoration and equalization , and as protection or aggression for men who had enemies or planned to have them . Morissa kept her guns ready for Indians and holdups and other lawlessness , but she could n't take the roadagents too seriously , even though their preying had stopped the Cheyenne coaches entirely for weeks at a time and left men dead in the dust of the trail . She always thought of roadagents in terms of Fly Speck Billy with his small-boy face , so curiously spattered by the dark freckles , although Robin had reminded her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had moved into her new place before it was half finished , and although her sign hung above the door , a small vigil light behind it through the dark hours , the large kalsomined hospital room seemed bare  | as a barn . The bunks were usually empty and the swinging coal-oil lamp over the operating table had been lit only once . Even Fish Head did not seem to be hungry any more , at least not hungry enough for her cooking . The young doctor wondered if she was being quarantined , lonecorraled , since no one came near her , not for so much as Epsom salts or toothache killer . And Tris Polk  --  how much of his avoidance grew out of her move across the river , how much from Calamity Jane and her " You little bastard ? ? " Then one afternoon a stagecoach left the road to the bridge and came thundering to her door , swaying crazily , the horses galloping heavily and uncontrolled . One fell in the harness , the rest stood with dropped heads , sides bellowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toppled toward her from the box . She caught him , eased him to the grass , her hands slick and sticky from the bleeding under an arm . Dried blood was splattered like brown paint down the side of the yellow coach , and inside four of the five passengers were wounded , and Owen , the guard on their Black Hills outing , too , with a thigh shattered and torn . Apparently somebody had got wind of the unscheduled run , for the stage was held up by a gang of masked men opposite a high rocky point . The driver refused to stop and while Owen , riding guard up in front , winged one of the roadagents , two passengers followed his orders and threw out the iron strongbox to divert the others . But the box was plainly too light , empty , and the thieves left it and came spurring up around the coach . While Owen picked off three of their horses , the driver was shot , and the guard himself was left clinging to the high seat , his broken leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could stop to get him inside . Later there was talk of a treasure shipment hidden in a worn carpetbag lined with buffalo leather , so heavy with gold it required two strong men to lift it out . But Morissa did n't see this . She called for Charley Adams from the bridge troops to help her work with the patients . Together they got the driver 's bleeding stopped , and started after the bullet and the bone fragments in Owen 's thigh . Although the splintered femur had punched out through a jagged hole big as two fists , the artery was untouched or there would have been a dead man inside when the coach reached the valley . True , the patient might still die , but in her three months beside this trail Morissa Kirk had discovered something of the toughness and the resilience of these people . So she showed the grizzled old army nurse what she wanted done with the ether , then , expert from much field practice , he spread the wound while the doctor gently probed its welling depths for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with carbolic acid solution , drew the leg out straight and long as the other , and packed and stitched the wound , leaving it deep tubed and open at the two ends . Because this would need constant  | observation , Morissa had Clarke 's blacksmith make a sort of iron frame from wagon rods over a temporary open cast , fastened the leg securely against slip or shift , and slung it up with a pulley and sandbag . Afterward , when they were out of their bloody cover aprons and resting a moment in the shade , the old soldier shook his head . " I seen Dr. Mary Walker time or two , but I never seen her work . All I can say , ma'am , is I never expected to see no woman doc get mixed in no job like this ? " Morissa smiled wearily , pushing the trailing hair off her hot neck . " Perhaps I did n't either . I 've never been faced with a bullet-shattered femur that had been banging against a galloping stagecoach before . But you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too different from repairing a splintered chair leg , except if we 're lucky this will grow together , even with the slivers that are missing ? " The wounds of the others were all comparatively minor . Only the woman with a bullet through the tendons of the neck , was really in pain . A little morphia would get all but Owen and the driver to Sidney , and so the bullet-pocked coach went on , one of the women spreading her old-fashioned crinolined skirts over the carpetbag with the gold again . Several times this bad first week the guard 's fever went very high , and angry red streaks began to move along the blood vessels . Morissa thought seriously of amputating the leg , but she clung to it as desperately as the patient now , the severance a personal mutilation in a land where the cripple was indeed a misfit . She worked with cold packs , she and Charley Adams , in two-hour shifts . It brought a little talk from the casual freighters and beef herd men . Maybe the Kirk woman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in over there . But the young doctor was too concerned to know . She gave her patient febrifuges and finally , in desperation , when the man was delirious and wasting , she tried a thick dark tea made from the silver sage weed that Lorette said the Sioux used for fever and blood poisoning . At least the tea was bitter enough to seem medicinal , and in a convalescent patient it ought to arouse a wolfish appetite . At best this was a sort of final gesture , for by then the patient was too weak and exhausted for the amputation . Somehow they kept Owen alive through those first weeks . Then suddenly he began to take notice . " Still got me in one piece , eh Doc ? " he asked weakly one day as Morissa examined the scant discharge from the tubes , sniffing it , testing it for grit between her fingers . Now the man began to eat , and to sleep . The swelling loosened and the wound began to drain and stink . Finally the doctor put a solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sidney , nearer to his friends . Henry Clarke stood beside Morissa as the wagon took the guard away .  | " I have been withholding my objections to your move across the river , my dear , hoping that you would get discouraged and leave for a more salutary location without my intercession , " he said , speaking with stiff formality . " I am still certain there will be serious trouble if you remain . However , I must express my gratitude to you , not as to the daughter of a trusted employee but to an excellent physician . " Morissa felt herself blushing over the forced little speech and tried to thank the man as she looked after the wagon with misted eyes , wanting to tell Henry Clarke that she appreciated something of his accomplishments for the West , for the homeseeker , including the seven bridges much like the one here that he had built over the frontier , built against all odds . Some of these odds she could at least name now . As soon as the troops along the Cheyenne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadagents began to work it again . After two guards were killed and three passengers shot , orders went out that the gold would come down in an armored coach , a treasure vault on wheels , with no passengers except guards inside and out , half a dozen armed riders far out in every direction . The regular coaches were to submit to search , everybody get out , hands in the air , women and all . But Henry Clarke would not have his passengers down in the dust to be mauled by ruffians . " Seems we were overconfident , " he told Morissa ruefully , pulling at his fine beard . " And my men paid with their blood . Next time I plan to leave the holdups bleeding . " He went East immediately and hunted out a pair of treasure guards who would n't be in cahoots with the roadagents , at least for a while . In addition he nailed a piece of rope neatly tied into a noose outside of each stage station , and was heard to say in the saloons up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each one as hungry for a man dancing at the end of a rope as the night before the grand opening . Clarke brought back something else , too , a beautifully chased belt watch for Morissa , a repeater with a sweet-toned little bell for the second hand , too , one that rang to a finger 's pressure after one minute . " No telling when you 'll be caught without a light , " he said , and when the girl tried to thank him he waved the words curtly away . " I wo n't have my men killed . Owen would be dead if you had n't been here . Now he 's alive and with a good serviceable leg . We 'll have no polite soft-talk ! " To Morissa it seemed time for firmness , too , with the attack on their stage and the killing they saw at Deadwood , the murderer untried . Now there was word that the gunman , Wild Bill Hickok , had been shot down , killed in Deadwood 's Number 10 Saloon with a bullet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The stage driver who told the story at Clarke 's one night had seen Wild Bill laid out handsome , with dark-faced men gathering along the street to string the murderer up . But just then a Mexican bullwhacker came spurring into town with an Indian head under his arm . It was half-dried and stinking , but certainly Indian , the long braids flying ? one of a vanguard of the killers of Custer come to attack Deadwood . A hat was passed through the roaring , milling crowd now doubly concerned with their cartridge belts . Around $70 in gold dust was gathered , although the posted bounty was $125 . Anyway , some said the whacker had merely cut off the warrior 's head after the freight boss shot him among the stock . Still it was of an Indian with a scalp , and killed very close to them here . The gulch hurried to man the defense . " So they lets the cold-blooded murderer get away , with Wild Bill layin ' there dead ? " one of the Hill-bound passengers demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortage of gunmen ? " Clarke said casually from his desk behind the counter . " Bill 's name was posted up in Cheyenne last winter , heading the list of a dozen or so undesirables warned to get out of town . Claimed he was a roadagent and professional killer . Bill slit the list from the wall with his skinning knife and stayed awhile , but a gunman can expect to get a dose of lead sooner or later ? " " Mebby Bill would n't use his gun fer you ! " a bar loafer shouted . Clarke ignored him . " It 's this Indian bounty that I do n't like , this paying for human scalps . I had hoped we were beyond that kind of savagery ? " The bridge builder did n't look toward Morissa as he said this , but he knew she had overheard the story , particularly about the scalp and the bounty , from the way she pushed her mail together and hurried out , half-blind . Some day she would do something desperate in one of these dark and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could not accept the rope . Morissa ran with her lantern , over the dark bridge and to her lonely place . She did n't look into her bundle of new medical books and her magazines , or even the letters . She sat with her hands clutched tightly in her lap , more alone than she had ever felt in all her life . Lieutenant Larman took Morissa through the new blockhouse on the little built-up island joined to Clarke 's bridge . Of native pine , it was erected as a warning and a protection against redmen and white who would attack this crossing . The second story , square too , but larger , was set diagonally upon the first , giving the gun slits complete command of any approaching enemy . So the new Camp Clarke stood , like a sort of thick , shaggy head lifted to look both ways over the long bridge .  | " At the first sign of danger you 're to hurry in here , and bring your pill sack and instruments , in case we have to stand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but underneath there was a deep seriousness . Morissa knew that his orders were sound , yet any attempt at an attack would certainly cut her off at once . No one knew where Crazy Horse and his great force of hostile Sioux were , and this , with the disturbing rumors from the mines , kept the travel past Morissa 's place down for weeks . Then suddenly there was a new gold strike in the Deadwood region , several , but in the more difficult business of hard-rock lodes , the richest one the Homestake , optimistically labeled the most promising gold mine in the world , with a Bolthoff Ball Pulverizer set to go into operation there before winter . The movement to Deadwood quickened once more , with the curious urgency of the gold-hungry , like ants running before the breath of winter . This was no business for the pick and gold pan , but much of the new heavy mine machinery needed now went in on the Kearney trail that started far down the Platte and cut across the sandhills and the rise called Pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it saved expensive railroad freight and was mostly through open prairie , long-grassed for the bull trains , the work-gaunted oxen no temptation to the roadagent or the buffalo-sweetened tooth of the Sioux . This shift that cut down the hauling on the Sidney gold trail and the tariff at the bridge brought other changes past Morissa 's door . ' ' here were fewer poor men with gold pans , more speculators and businessmen , some with families of small children , and maple dressers and square pianos for something more permanent than the swift , hot flash of the placer boom . Sturdy hard-rock miners came in , and the gamblers and the fancy women were less tawdry and less receptive to the charm of Fish Head . So he moved back to the bridge , but with no news of Tom Reeder since he left the man at the post hospital at Sidney . The young antelope had vanished almost at once , probably into some empty frying pan . A lot of trash was coming in down there , old Fish said disapprovingly . Morissa fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dish of lettuce from her little garden . He hung around to comment on the sights he had seen as he wiped the tall hat he always brought out for the passing coaches . " It is becoming most effete up in the Hills , " he said . " I must find some less decadent camp , some Eldorado more worthy a true prospector 's talents ? " " You have n't the footwear for winter around Deadwood , " Morissa teased . " Not where it goes down to thirty below zero , as all our friends up there could tell you . " But if she thought she might hear news of Tris Polk , she was disappointed .  | " Ah , I am a lover of nature , an attentive swain to all her changing moods ? " was all he answered . But whatever Fish Head thought about Deadwood , many remembered uneasily that every dollar of gold taken from the earth up there was still the legal property of the Indians . So another conference for the purchase of the Black Hills was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers headed to Red Cloud Agency , many of them contractors of pants and blankets , of sugar , coffee , and beef , and of wagons , plows , and hoes . Morissa sat on her Appaloosa beyond the bridge a ways as the army ambulances with the commission passed , and the fast rigs of the contractors . She recalled the stink of the salt pork going to the Indians earlier in the summer , and wondered what they could hope to receive now . " All gathering like buzzards to the kill ? " Robin said sourly , perhaps because he had returned to go up , too , hoping for a little work there after a while . The council must turn out better than last year . There had been an hour or two then when none of the commission to buy the Hills , not even the generals , hoped to get out alive , so angry were the young warriors at this talk of selling their country . But this year the wild young Sioux were away north with Crazy Horse and would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped to the breechclout , waving their rifles and crying for blood . This time the conference would meet inside the agency stockade , with bayoneted troops all around , and cannon . Morissa went up with Sid Martin . If he was to make anything out of his cattle he had to see about beef contracts . With this horse collar that she kept on him , he felt safer with his doctor along . So Morissa took a wild ride in Sid Martin 's top buggy behind a team of calico bronchs that he managed by half-standing at the dashboard , herding them along in the general direction with whip and line . Morissa 's little velvet hat was over her nose one minute and flying back the next , but the doubletrees held and they got there , the horses lathered white , eyes still rolling for something to send them off again . " I did a better job on your neck than I realized , " Morissa said ruefully as she took Sid Martin 's hand to step from the buggy . There was a post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the Sioux conference with the men . The stockade was full , mostly with whites , for no Indian except the chiefs and headmen was permitted inside . The commissioners talked a long time , and then one blanketed Sioux after another rose from their council circle on the floor , the oratory interrupted by many " Hous ! " of approval from the rest . They talked but they would not sign for the sale , and so the third day all visitors were sent out and the gates of the stockade bolted . There  | the chiefs must remain until they did sign , and their families , their women and children outside , would get no flour or meat , nothing at all until the pen was touched . It was a difficult time for Chief Red Cloud . Only ten years ago he was powerful enough to force the Army out of the Bozeman trail forts that were set up to protect another gold rush through the Indian country promised to his people so long as grass shall grow and water flow . But his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency in the shadow of the soldier cannon and the hunger the white man brought . With his face like the eternal granite of the Hills the chief arose , drew his blanket about him and led the row of silent men to the table where the white paper lay , and that night the keening of women along White River was as for a great man dead . Morissa heard them and had no response for Sid Martin 's elation that now there would be really fat contracts from the money the Indians got for the Black Hills . There would be contracts unless the Senate reneged and decided to pay the Sioux nothing for the sale , now that Crook 's army was safe in Deadwood . " I wonder if I am becoming an Indian lover ? " Morissa said on the way home . " It do n't matter now , with the Hills bought up . But Indian lovers been run out of the country ? " " Like settlers ? " Morissa asked slowly . For a moment the cattleman looked at the girl beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so firmly held in her brown leather collar . " Ahh , Miss Morissa , I ca n't see you goin ' on living there on that open range , like some rustler building up a spread with rope and running iron . ? But I ai n't like some , " he added thoughtfully . " If you really wanted to live there , I 'd be just the man to humor you . " Morissa had to laugh this away , and said no more about land or Indians . After the wild team had taken Sid across the bridge and on south , she went to the station for her mail . There were a lot of freighters gathered for some visiting in the whisky store . They looked in her direction under their dusty hats , saying something about Sid Martin among themselves . Maybe he was cutting out both Tris Polk and the lieutenant So the young doctor gathered up her mail and hurried out and across the bridge that stood over the gold-touched river of evening . Not until she got inside the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the letters . Inside was a birthday hand card from Allston Hoyt , the hand carved from thin ivory and holding a silken bouquet of fall flowers . There was nothing to indicate the sender except the bold broadstroke of her address , not a word added to the greeting , not even  | his name . Yet it was a kindness and Morissa 's throat tightened as she touched the lovely satin asters . But suddenly she recalled how he knew her birthdate  --  from the genealogical search his sister had made . With one swift motion of her strong fingers she tried to rip the card in two , but it did not tear like paper would , only cracked into slivers of ivory in her hand . THEN ONE NIGHT THE GRAY CAT CAME SCRATCHING AT THE DOOR and crawled with frosted whiskers under the cover at Morissa 's breast . In the morning there was a white rime over all the river valley , and as the sun climbed the morning glories at the window let their leaves droop , cooked , and the portulacas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was a fine golden fall , the upland tawny and red-clumped where the prairie rosebushes sat close to the earth . The buckbrush browned , too , the berries waxen white , the deer leaping from the patches to stand off against the hillside and look as Morissa rode by . The rifle was as certainly in her scabbard or across her buggy bed now as her pill sack went along ? always on longer trips during the Indian scare , but even on short rides since one early morning when she came driving back from another typhoid patient down at Redington 's . She had been idling along through a rocky pass as dawn cleared , looking off toward the shadowy plum thickets where she got a bushel for preserves last week , and wondered about the wild grapes . Suddenly the horses had reared , lunged sideways , and snapped the tongue off . The next jump drove the broken end of the tongue into the ground and shot the buggy up into the air . It went over forward , throwing Morissa clear . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rutted trail , with the doctor still clinging to the lines , dragged face down through chuck holes and stones and brush , battered and torn . In danger of losing her eyes , even her life , and with just sense enough to squeeze her lids tight and turn her head to the side , she hung on , her arms ripped and her face and throat , too , until it seemed she could not let go any more and would certainly be destroyed . But finally the horses began to slow a little and then they stopped , blowing , worn out . A long time Morissa could only lie still and when she managed to collect herself she was afraid of scaring the team into  | another runaway . At last she stumbled to her feet , bleeding everywhere it seemed , pounded , skinned , and lacerated , but without broken bones . She got the horses quieted , Nellie first and then Kiowa , and tied securely to separate pines , still panting , lathered , and nervous as she had never seen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been flung out , and her medical bag , too , with only a few vials broken . Then she looked around for something that could have frightened the bays so . She found it in a soft spot of earth where the horses had bolted  --  the pad mark of a big cat , the track larger than her hand . Swiftly she looked all around and up to the rocks above her . There , on a ledge over the road and not fifty feet away , a mountain lion watched her lazily , the long tawny body half-raised but still slack , relaxed . Slowly the girl started to retreat , moving backward , an inch , two , always in the direction of the buggy and the rifle . The cat watched without alarm or anger or much interest , blinking like an indolent sleepy yellow torn . The rising sun that touched the rocks above him moved down , sharpening the gold of the magnificent head and the tensing shoulders . But at last the girl 's exploring foot found the buggy wheel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she drew the gun up carefully , slowly , to aim , the lion seemed to sense what this was and rose , still easily , however , without apparent menace or alarm . But it seemed that he whirled just as she pulled the trigger , leaping as the shot roared out , and started up the bluff face . ' ! ' lien he was gone , Morissa too inexperienced to know if the leap was from the bullet . With the rifle clutched by the grip she scrambled up the ledge as well as she could in her stiffness , only vaguely recalling the danger from a wounded lion . But she slowed when she saw fresh drops of blood curling dry sand about themselves , small , bright inside , probably from the lung . She followed more cautiously now , but through brush and pine needles she lost the trail , so she returned to the buggy . By notching the broken pieces of the tongue to hold the wire always in the buggy box with her spade and the lantern , she spliced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel she carried for emergency splints . Then she went to kick earth carefully over the cat tracks , hoping the scent would be gone by now . With Nellie , the quieter of the bays , she pulled the buggy back up on its crazy wheels , hitched up and then led the nervous team through the pass . Finally she climbed in , so sore she could scarcely lift her foot to the step . By the time she reached the bridge she was in serious pain even through the morphia she had to take . When the man came to lift the toll arm he took one look at her and dropped it back down . " Miss Morissy ! " he exclaimed , and called out , " Hey , Help ! Doe 's been hurt ! " as he got her out and into the stage station . There he  | brought coffee and a washbasin as the few early customers trooped in curiously from the bar . Not until she saw their faces did Morissa realize how she must look , her face bloody and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bleeding arms . Only her cap and the stout denim of the jumper she always wore on cool night drives had saved her head , her throat , her breast from being stripped to the bone . Before she was done with the story the young men around were faunching to start after the lion , but the old hunters like Etty advised a little wait . Let him stiffen from his wound , at least until they could get trail dogs from that Englishman visiting over at the Tanner ranch . It was nearing noon when Allan Barrow rode in . He looked at Morissa 's bandages in reserved astonishment . He called his dogs upliver-spotted , little more than a good mouthful each for the lion  --  and with Etty and Lieutenant Larman led the hunters out , enough rifles and ammunition along for an Indian uprising . Morissa had to turn back before they got half a mile out and wait for their return toward evening , with the mountain lion across the back of Etty 's pack mare . The wounded cat had n't gone far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big rock . Good thing Morissa did n't catch up with him . A gut-shot lion was bad as a grizzly . Allan Barrow had a traveling photographer take a picture of Morissa standing over the dead lion with her Winchester . She had removed some of the bandages but she still looked like the victim of a mauling . " This will make my good relatives realize they have exiled me to a very wild and dangerous wilderness , " Allan said in satisfaction . Afterward he had a long table set up at Clarke 's for the hunters and Morissa . The next day the young doctor wondered at herself . She had acted as proud and show-offy as a ten-year-old with his first ' possum . Maybe it was the wine with the venison . But she would have a nice rug for her fireplace and the Britisher was taking her to Tanner 's dance , if her face was n't too scabby . Three days later Tris Polk came , driving a handsome yellow-wheeled buggy with white-stockinged blacks , the kind of horses he liked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " but you know the old saying , Four white feet , feed ' em to the crows . ' " Morissa laughed as easily as she could with her healing face and the hurt of the man 's absence , and her own foolish and undeniable joy at seeing him again , even if the buggy was purchased for Gilda Ross . They looked the new team over together , the beautiful heads and flaring nostrils , the large luminous eyes with fire burning there  --  almost like Arabians , Tris said , but a hand and a half taller . The white-tasseled buggy bridles were certainly grand on them .  | They talked about Morissa 's runaway with her team , about what was going on around Sidney and the trail , the news from Deadwood and about the Philadelphia Centennial celebration , the World 's Fair , that Tris had hoped to take in while he was in Chicago with the Forsons . Then there was the Presidential campaign too  --  anything except the mention of Morissa 's move to the north of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pretty permanent settler layout plunk in the middle of the cattle country . " I hear you patched up Owen 's shattered leg fine , and have Sid Martin planning to ride in the fall roundup . " Morissa raised her hands in despair . " You Western men ! Sid will probably get his head snapped off again , and live through that too . Next time I 'll wire him together . From now on I 'm going to nail all the broken bones together ? " So they talked , a little awkwardly , mostly of impersonalities , and in the afternoon they drove out to the Wild Cat range where Morissa shot the lion . Through Tris 's spyglass they saw a bighorn sheep far up on the gray bluffs with her young standing behind her , and farther off two rams , their great curling horns like a vague darkness over their heads . " Proud , noble creatures , are n't they ? " Morissa said , a choke in her throat as the rams turned and leapt over a crevasse , stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother and her young off the other way . " My , I love this country , " she exclaimed , holding out her arms , rubbing the inside of one and then the other , where the excitement flowed . " But your doctoring 'll fall off to nothing in the winter , when the travel slows down . " " The country will still be here . " " With thirty-five below zero , and a blizzard wind ? " They returned through the evening sun that lay orange along the far ridges of the northeast . But there was a chill at the river . Two antelope grazed beside the trail , tamer than all summer , and soon the sky would be full of geese going south . At her place Tris drew his team off the trail and stopped up beside her little creek dam . Morissa sat quiet , holding herself ready for the complaints against her , the protests and the anger . But the rancher looked down along the little ditch to the golden-leafed young cottonwoods of the yard , some already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flower beds , browned , except the asters and the petunias , that had started again since the frost , with bright green grass around them . " Water makes a lot of difference in this country , " he said . " Yes , all this wide valley could be fruitful as ? "  | " I know , fruitful as the Nile . But it would mean the end of cattle here , the finest business in the world . " And to this Morissa had no reply . It did n't matter , for today was like a home-coming , with Tris back . There was a little Indian scare when the lightning of a fall storm showed a pack of Indians fording the river , or at least one man thought so and rode like a leather-chapped Revere through the bridge settlement , yelling , " The redskins are out ! " Private Charley Adams hurried to get Morissa but she had a typhoid patient and could n't leave him , certainly not with Indians around . So the troopers brought a litter and carried him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Morning dawned clear and undisturbed , and there was nothing except the half-obliterated tracks of unshod ponies , mounted horses , the station master said . Probably horse thieves . But it might have been Indians , perhaps fleeing trouble , for two days later word came that Chief Red Cloud had been caught sneaking his people away north to Crazy Horse and the entire band was disarmed and dismounted by the troops . Eddie Ellis came down , making the news an excuse for a visit . He told Morissa he had gone with the scouts that swept away the pony herd at dawn , before the Indians knew they were surrounded . Red Cloud 's wife even had her chickens along ; he heard the rooster 's crow just before they struck the pony herd . Got them all , even the Chief 's parade horse given him by the government . A few were turned over to the military at Robinson but most just got lost on the way there , up some draw or down a canyon . Eddie laughed . " I got six myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The whole kaboodle of Indians was driven back to the agency afoot , carrying the bundles they could , losing most of the rest . Morissa guessed that the new post surgeon would have a lot of sick children and adults too on his hands , with winter close and no shelter or blankets for thousands of Indians . She said something of this to Lorette but the little breed woman only drew her blanket up over her bowed head and held her Siouan silence . That evening Morissa and Eddie saw two men shot in a drunken brawl at Etty 's , the outcome of an old trail herd grudge , it was said . She was touched with the way Eddie threw himself before her when the first bullet buried itself in the sod wall . Truly the bright October weather , the finest Morissa had ever seen , was no time of tranquillity here , nor in herself . During the summer the sand bars of the river had pushed their impatient backs up through the tepid waters , most of their nakedness soon covered by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had avoided the toll by fording the wide , sandy Platte , derisively described as half a mile wide and an inch deep in the wry humor common to the more precarious regions of man . It was curious how Morissa already felt herself tied to this stream , first in the turbulent gray anger of May , and in the placid summertime , too , even to the newer sand bars that were only thin layerings over quicksand , all potential buffalo springs , as the cowboys called them , waiting just under the yellowish surface . " The water 'll come boilin ' up if you take a few fast steps in one spot , the sand shakin ' under your heels ? " one told Morissa and took her to an empty new strip to demonstrate . Almost at once the gray sandy water boiled up about his boots as it had the hoofs of the great herds of buffalo all the summers that the Platte went dry , their water-hungry noses drawing them to mill around on the empty bed of the river until 11ie water came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own turbulence lay under the smooth sand bars of her existence Morissa realized the day she saw a man get out of the coach and stand , back to her , so like Allston Hoyt that her heart knocked against her ribs once and seemed to stop . She had turned and hastened away without her mail and afterward she did not know if she had really hidden in her dusky sod house , or merely retreated there to await the lover . But Allston did not come , no one came , and the stage with fresh horses thundered over the long bridge and away northward past her place . In the despondent time afterward she recalled the doctor at medical school who denounced women in public life , all public life . They were too weak to resist the pressing lover and must have the constant presence and protection of a strong male hand , father or husband . So it had happened to her mother , and so it could have happened to her today , not at fifteen , as to Lorna Kirk , but at twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading stage company of the Cheyenne-Black Hills trail seemed convinced that the time for romanticizing in their business was over . With the Indians sold out of the Hills , the prospects justified u practical , long-range approach . So the stage owners moved many of their coaches down to the safer and shorter Sidney trail , using Clarke 's facilities . Morissa saw their first coach draw up at the bridge and watched the awe and envy too for the guards , these veteran shotguns who had fought their way regularly through the Robbers Roost country . Winter cut down the adventurous travel and outside of a few accidents and a little pneumonia , influenza , and smallpox , Morissa had time to study and to carry on a correspondence with doctors longer on the frontier . Tris was away much of the time but there was skating with the Lieutenant , sometimes with his friends from Fort Robinson or the  | Sidney post , a big fire burning on the bank , the red reflected on the glassy ice of the river , and an occasional dance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find it very dull ? " waiting for the tenderfoot lady doc to pull out . Even Robin and Jackie said it Christmas time , the two days she spent with them in a bleak little hotel in the middle of the state . " We 're a family ; we have to spend at least part of the holidays together ? " she told them gaily . But Robin knew it was to forget last year and the happiness with Allston I-Ioyt . The winter was a mild one even to the Easterners . The coaches ran on schedule and with the range open the bulls worked through instead of giving way to the horses and mules that could paw snow for feed and , with a little grain , usually kept the freight moving . There was a little St. Patrick 's dance planned at Clarke 's but Morissa missed it . She was far away , near the place where Sid Martin 's herd stampeded last June . A note had come by stage saying a man was dying of pneumonia in a soddy along the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about starting out alone , with the morning sun so curiously white , but at the blockhouse she found that Charley Adams was off with a scouting party for some Indian herds reported stolen . So she left a note asking him to keep an eye on her convalescents and got ready to go out alone , but she drew on a heavy pair of woolen pants of Robin 's instead of a skirt , and high overshoes . She put his old buffalo coat into the buggy and a sack of provisions , too , in case the man was out of groceries , with no ranch or trail anywhere near . Then , with her rifle and her compass she settled the bays into their steady little trot up the worn trail , watching for the angle-off into the sandhills . The day was mild and dusty , the bull trains plodding as thick as midsummer , the men walking beside them in short sheepskin coats thrown open . By the time Morissa left the trail the sun was gone and a thin rain had started . By two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veered toward the northwest . The sleet became fine sharp snow that searched out every crack of the buggy curtains and ran about the horses ' feet , piling into long trailing drifts . Morissa shook the snow from the buffalo coat , wishing she had come horseback . Gradually all the holes and little washouts were covered over and the buggy lurched and swayed in the rising blizzard . As the snow deepened to the hubs , the horses began to plunge to get through , jerking against the light doubletrees that Morissa knew might go any moment . Twice they refused a drift and the doctor had to wallow out into the powdery snow and , with the buggy whipstock to plumb the loose depths , lead Nellie around gullies that would have swallowed buggy and team . Finally she had to stay at the heads of the horses to keep them moving at all , floundering breathlessly in the buffalo coat , hip deep .  | When the whipping blizzard was so thick that she could hardly breathe standing still , she stopped at what seemed a sheltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her rifle into the buggy robe , and fastened the pack on Kiowa the best she could with the lines and tugs . Holding her pill bag and her lantern , and very bulky in her buffalo coat , she climbed on the gentler Nellie and started away into the roaring storm , leading Kiowa by his hitching rope tied to Nellie 's Names . All Morissa could hope to do was hold the horses in the general direction of the wide flat that she had found once before , but in bright sunlight , and somehow locate a new little sod house built near the seepage springs . If she missed it  --  but she would n't think about that now , for that one little shack was the last in all the empty region of the sandhills ahead of her , and a sick man was alone inside , probably too weak to keep a fire going . Even so she tried to turn back to the trail once , hoping somehow to strike a storm-corraled bull train with covered wagons , or even a wagon of gold seekers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the stinging blizzard . Then she remembered that the team had been up at Sid Martin 's temporary cowcamp , so she took the desperate chance that she must ; she let Nellie have her head , particularly when she saw that the young mare did n't drift downwind but worked leftward , sidling into the storm . The cold was very sharp now . Morissa 's foot and all her leg on the windy side was numb and wooden when the white dusk of early evening began to settle . Soon she must admit that they had passed the flat and were lost in the big sandhills , without house or tree for a hundred miles , even the buffalo and cow chips , the only fuel , deep tinder snow . Soon she must find a place out of the wind and hope she could tie the horses down , hog-tie them close together and crawl in between for their body heat before she was too exhausted . Even then they might be drifted over together , frozen and smothered as Robin told of whole bull trains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or to Allston , no matter if there was to be no wedding ? Twice the horses stopped and would hardly go on in spite of all her wooden kicks and urgings . Suddenly Nellie 's snow-caked head seemed to come up ; together the horses turned and , side by side , plunged through a breast-deep drift almost into the wind . Morissa could only turn her face from the storm and gasp for breath , letting her horses go their way . Then Kiowa whinnied and they both stopped , close up against a wall that seemed to be sod under the drifting snow , with a horse vaguely reaching a head over to sniff the newcomers . Sobbing her relief that they had found shelter , any shelter now , Morissa slid awkwardly into the snow and , dragging the horses along , started to plow along the corral wall on her wooden feet . Against it was a soddy and Morissa pushed the door open into a dead chilliness  | and the smell of dreadful disease . Stiffly she tied the horses and went inside to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk , half conscious . A touch of her frozen fingers to the brow and the pulse , the thin tendons on the fleshless wrists already like cold steel wire , and the doctor could have cried again . Instead she asked about fuel . At the slow turn of the man 's eyes she plunged out into the storm and found a snowy cow-chip pile against the house . With the fire going she looked at the wasted , exhausted man and tried to give him a little hot tea , a little brandy with her thawing hands that ached so as the blood returned . She was very clumsy , but he could not have swallowed at the best . The gray , opaque eyes held a sadness and an apology , the apology of the dying , and so she arranged him more comfortably and then sat half the night beside his body . Finally when the man was like a frozen creature , she decided to put him outside for the long wait before burial , in a sort of return to the cleansing elements from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo robe but thin as he was she could not lift him , and so she used the old tarp from his bed instead . When she went out to look after her team the man 's two horses came to her , as though expecting a little grain . Cautiously she moved around the soddy into the blinding storm , careful not to lose touch with the wall until she found what she hoped  --  a wheel , a wagon up close , and under the covered bows a sack with a little ear corn . She drew out eight , and let the horses take the ears from her mittened hand , her head laid against the snowy necks for a moment in gratitude to them all . Although still half-frozen and shaking she propped the door open a while to let the clean blizzard air sweep through the evil place , the snow popping and steaming against the stove . Then she threw out the soiled soogans and dug the contaminated earth away under the wall bunk , filling the hole with the clean , powdery gray ashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove as long as he had the strength . She melted snow and boiled the tin cups and the rest , and then scrubbed the frying pan and the iron bean pot with earth until they gleamed . Afterward she fried a couple of strips of bacon and a little baking-powder bread . Finally she rolled up in her buffalo coat and slept , too weary for self-blaming , for sorrow or regret . On the fourth day the sun came out clear . The broad flat valley was the same pure glistening white as the first time she saw it , in hail , and Sid Martin with his neck broken . Today there was no relief from the glare except the dark corral , the horses , and several deer moving in the buckbrush off eastward , plunging through the drifts to clear a few  | clinging dead leaves . They would be easy targets for Morissa 's rifle but she did not bring it out . Prairie chickens flew over in a silvery flock toward the wind-bared ridge to the south , their cackling like busy , friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the horses over there , too , hobbling Nellie and Kiowa with the halter ropes and turning the others loose . She would have to leave the man 's team behind , but not to die in the sod corral . The horses grazed hungrily with no urge to drift , her hobbled team pawing awkwardly , and by two o'clock Morissa was glad she had given them this little time to eat for a gray wall of flying cloud was moving along the north , and little curls of snow began to run over the long drifts . She was bundling up to go out for the bays when a herd of horses appeared along the barer ridges to the northeast , running fast , throwing the snow high . First she thought they were wild but then she saw horsebackers close , closer than any wild mustang would permit ? probably one of the stolen Indian herds the troopers were looking for . As they came up even with the four horses along the slope , one of the riders turned to wrangle them in . He whooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Morissa 's angry shouting and waving her cap in protest . Then he turned back for the bay team and started them up the ridge too . But their hobbled movement was so slow he stopped and was surely going to cut them free , leave the doctor afoot here in the snowbound hills . Furious , Morissa ran for her rifle , steadied it against the doorjamb and put a bullet into the snow at the man 's feet and then a second one before the smoke spread blue around the doorway . The man turned to look and the three driving the herd also slopped , one of them jerking something long , a rifle , from a scabbard . This was the showdown , Morissa knew , and she fired once more , this time to strike among the close running bunch of horses . Apparently it nicked one , for the herd exploded in a great burst of snow and scattered off southward , the long mustang manes and tails flying high and cloudy in the wind , the horsebackers hard after them . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his saddle and spurred his gray horse through the drifts straight for the sod shack . Morissa had to make a quick decision . If she could put a bullet very close over his head , but without hitting him , he might decide it was n't worth the risk . She shot , but her hand was unsteady and the charge went wide , too plainly the aim of a poor shot . The man kept coming , with a red spurt from his pistol and a bullet that splintered he doorpost beside her . Now Morissa Kirk had to realize that this was like a desperate emergency operation , with the stake apparently a life  --  her life . And as in such an emergency she calmed to the task at once and aimed on the horse plunging straight for her through the deep drifts and very  | close . She drew a careful bead on the chest where a miss could do no more than break the man 's leg , although she knew now that she might well have to kill or be killed . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stayed with the saddle as the gray pawed himself up , reared and floundered , then recovered and ran crazily back toward the hill , plainly dying . One of the riders driving the herd had turned and was headed toward Morissa but now he spurred over the wind-blown slope to pick up the man who cowered behind his down gray in the snow . Together they whipped away on the one horse , but they emptied a warning revolver toward the soddy , one bullet making a neat hole in the stovepipe . When they were gone Morissa leaned against the door , trembling , the stink of black powder sharp to her nose . Then it occurred to her that the men might return , come up from all sides , and so with the butcher knife she dug gun slits through the sod near each corner , watching while she dug the holes , her hands shaking even after she was done . The house grew very cold for she did n't dare go out for fuel any more than for the horses , afraid of rifles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hobbled jump , quieted and eating again , and after a while Kiowa was back beside her too . Now if the wind would die towards night , and the clouds stay back so she could find the team in the darkness As soon as dusk moved out of the low hills Morissa tramped snow into the wool of her buffalo coat to whiten it ; then , with corn in her pocket and her rifle across her arm , she slipped out . The cold burned her nose ; the drifts creaked under her feet , the sound like an echo from someone following . A dozen times she stopped , stooping low , but there was no shot from anywhere , no sound in the white starlight except a wolf 's call and the noise of the hobbled horses , still feeding , moving in the cold . Nellie nickered softly and came forward , smelling the ear of corn Morissa held out to her . Cautiously , walking hidden between the two horses in the dusk , Morissa returned to the soddy . It was still empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nellie first , snorting at the smell of fire and death . After a while the warier Kiowa followed his teammate through the open door . With no light except the fire of the little stove , Morissa watched the gun slits , wishing she had Etty 's loud barking old Blaze dog here . The waiting depressed the weary doctor , with the poor man lying frozen beside the sod wall outside . The drive to self-preservation had carried her to a willingness to shoot , even to kill this afternoon , but now that was gone and the doubt of all her presence and premise here settled down like some dark and sooty cloud . It brought mistrust of  | every action , not only her stubborn decision to remain , a lone woman in the wilderness , but the impulse to come West at all , and behind that the foolish notion that she could ever have become the wife of a Hoyt . Even doubts of her decision to become a doctor gathered like dark buzzards to brood in the snowbound soddy . But this final destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her self-hatred might attack this night , her profession was beyond question , sacred . A daughter of Aesculapius , Fish Head had called her , and the thought of the old fraud 's posturing made her laugh aloud in her strain . Nellie stirred from sleep and rattled her halter as she reached toward the woman . Morissa went to her , rubbed the soft nose and Kiowa 's , too , then looked all around the empty night snow and hoped that Fish Head was under cover somewhere , and that the man who had brought up the drags of the horse herd today was not Eddie Ellis even though it looked like him , a little . Morissa knew he had lost his job at the Indian agency , or given it up , probably given it up as Jackie might , with the vacillation of the unformed , and no one to advise him , to steady him as the goodness in Robin might steady his son . Afterward Morissa wondered why she somehow always included Jackie with Eddie Ellis . Dawn came clear , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time to get the dead man on Nellie , shying and fractious , but finally Morissa put the frozen body into empty corn sacks with the smell of grain still in them . Then , while Nellie ate the last ears of corn in a cloud of frosty breath , the doctor eased the man across the mare 's back from the corral wall and tied him awkwardly but firmly between the hames and the crupper . With her rifle handy , Morissa started away on Kiowa , leading the mare . She rode a saddle now . Just before dawn she had gone boldly out and got it from the robber 's dead horse . She had looked for a brand , too , but if there was one it was on the underside . She angled along the barer ridges toward the nearest trail station . In a snow-filled canyon she saw what looked like a whole bull train drifted with the storm , a few heads and frozen backs showing , eagles and buzzards already circling against the pale spring blue , and a wolf waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a plume . The doctor wondered about the other outsiders in the country , tenderfeet made complacent by the easy winter and the deceptive warmth of the morning before the storm , but mostly she fought the weariness from her night of watching and the glare of the snow that blinded her eyes behind the protective smudging of soot on her cheekbones . Yet she had to keep going and by the compass , with everything strange in  | this white sweep of drifts . When she finally reached a little log station her throat was raw and swollen , closing as with quinsy , and she was shaking . But first she had to look at a man found unconscious by the herders hunting for their drifted bulls . He was thawed out now and in bad shape . The whole ends of both his feet were dying with gangrene and at least three fingers of one hand would have to go . " The trail to the Platte is n't open ? " the doctor asked . " No , not even a horsebacker over it yet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big and not too hopeful dose of quinine for her cold , and slept for three hours to break the chills and steady her hand . When she was called , the man was delirious , so with the help of a stranded freighter who had seen a lot of blood in the Civil War , she amputated what she knew she must . " ? I just ca n't take as much as might be advisable . I ca n't bear to leave a man here with no feet at all , " she said , holding her voice steady as she worked swiftly , too swiftly . And when it was done and the patient semiconscious , she set herself to watch through the night . " I 'll stay the three worst days . If he seems to be making it , I 'll go home and he 's to be brought down as soon as the trail 's open . In the meantime , if more inflammation shows up , rush him down to me any way you can , or get me and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friend of mine had three sawin 's on one leg . Finally took it off clear to here , " the freighter said , his hand laid grimly across from the groin , " but I 'd a rather seen him in the bone yard . " " Never rather dead , " the doctor in Morissa protested . " But I have hopes for him . This is a tough , healthy country and he does n't look like a tenderfoot . " " No , been freighting for years . Storms like this one could catch anybody , if luck ran that way . Joe here  --  his horse stepped in a prairie-dog hole in the snow and snapped off a front leg so he had to hoof it five miles against the wind and did n't quite make it . Could happen to anybody . " Ten days after she drove out of the north valley Morissa came riding back on Nellie , leading Kiowa  --  the first traveler on the trail except Clarke 's express riders . Most of the ridges were baring now , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel through the snowdrifted valley , with the yellow bluffs and the dark pines along the south , and Chimney Rock an unbelievable spire , like something from a fairy landscape . The whole population was out to meet Morissa at the north end of the bridge , soldiers and everybody from Fish Head up , even Clarke , who had come in from Sidney horseback to count his losses . " Never go  | out on a long winter call alone again , my dear , " he said , holding the worn , snow-burned girl in his arms a moment . " We ca n't have anything happen to our lady doe . Why , you know , four men , old-timers in the West , froze to death in the Sidney region alone , and no telling how many more over the country . One was out hunting the bighorns you saw in the Wild Cats  --  not ten miles from here . " As he talked , mostly to cover his anxiety , Morissa looked around the emotional faces , the watery eyes of old Etty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breed wife . " It 's like coming home from a far , far journey ? " she finally said , and kissed the brown cheek of Lorette 's baby . Then slowly she went to her house with the Lieutenant walking beside her to hear the story of the horse thieves . The two went along the path worn by those who cared for her stock while she was away , bluecoats from the post leading the two bays , but remaining well behind . IX OUTLAWRY FATTENS ON AN INCREASE IN GOLD , AND EVERYBODY said that 1877 would double , perhaps triple , the two million dollars taken from the Hills last year despite the many alarms of mines gone dry . All this dust had to be carried out , and by now the banks of Deadwood needed large supplies of currency , mostly brought in from their financial connections at Cheyenne . The March blizzard that isolated the Hills for two weeks , and almost starved Deadwood , was hardly reduced to dirty drifts , the dead and missing not all counted , when Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just outside of the gulch . Morissa knew Sam . He was around Clarke 's bridge with a trail herd from Texas for over a month last summer and there the doctor saw hint often after Eddie Ellis brought the man over to have a bullet cut out of his knee . " Been in there for some time , Doc , but it 's just worked up an ache on my cutting horse lately ? " he said , surprisingly soft-spoken for his shaggy appearance . But Morissa remembered the extra , the secret gun he carried , one on his hip and the other in a holster under his shirt , swinging in his armpit like a gambler 's . He had offered her a very good saddle horse in payment , too large a fee , but naturally without a bill of sale . The doctor  | shook her head and took a couple of silver dollars , about all he had left from the cockfights  --  betting on a surly bird that Fish Head had carried up from Sidney in a gunny sack to pit against Etty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor a cup of coffee and fry cakes at Clarke 's while she waited for the blacksmith to trim Nellie 's split hoof . Sam was waiting too  --  for the herd to start north to Deadwood . He wanted to stay around the bridge , he said , but there were no jobs , and Eddie knew somebody up the trail Now there was this story of the holdup , with much laughing and slapping of thighs , even though the driver , well liked at the bridge , had been killed . Seemed Bass and the rest of his scrub , raked-together gang drove the killer out afterward because he scared the stage horses off with a bale of currency big as a bedroll and a bucketful of gold coins in the coach . So he went back to Fly Speck Billy . It reminded Morissa of the old stories of Scottish border robbers that her mother liked to tell , always ending with the same words : " A boaster and a liar are canny kin but a highwayman will tread into a well as quick as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had loafed around the Deadwood saloons since the blizzard . It was suspected they were one of the outfits watching for the currency shipment from Cheyenne , but not that they would n't go off the doorstep for the holdup . While the coach was delayed by mud and snowbanks , Sam 's straw boss managed to shoot himself in the foot . The man substituted to make the plans went out into the moonlight to the first narrow curve coming into the gulch . He took along half a case of whisky to celebrate and to keep off the chill of waiting and got drunk . When the full moon stood almost overhead for midnight , Bass , disgusted , signaled the outfit home but just then they heard the thunder of the Concord coach on the frosty air as it came around the bend , the white horses always used on the run into town making a fine show in the moonlight , their silver trappings bright . With a gun in each hand , Sam Bass stepped out into the road and ordered the driver to halt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the men in the brushy rocks and timber on each side , and so the driver yelled " Whoa ! " and leaned back on the lines . But another of the men had done a little celebrating and came crashing out of the brush with a loud roar to grab at a bit of the lead team . Frightened , the horses reared back into the others , setting them all into the air . Then they bolted and he emptied his sawed-off shotgun into the driver , who fell dead from the box as the horses thundered uncontrolled past Sam and along the narrow winding cliff trail leading into Deadwood , the high Concord rocking and swaying between bluff and canyon . A passenger riding the box grabbed the lines and got the  | horses together just as they were headed off a sharp turn into the treetops far below . Although it was midnight , the whole town was out as usual to greet the stage . The sheriff got a posse moving at once but they found nothing except the dead driver on the frosty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bass outfit in town but none of the passengers could identify him . The rest had sobered enough to hit for the canyons . " Your old friend sure botched that job , Doc  --  went at it like a greenhorn badman , " Owen told Morissa down at Clarke 's . He was at Deadwood that night , even managed to get his stiff leg over a horse to ride with the posse , but mostly they warmed their bellies against the bar at Number 10 and talked about stringin ' ' em up . " Did n't the outlaws get any money ? " the practical Gwinnie asked . " Hell , no , but plenty fancy cussin ' from Sam , I hear ? " The dead man got a fine funeral  --  carried to the Cheyenne cemetery in a stagecoach drawn by six white horses with silver trappings . Owen and several drivers from the Sidney trail went up with Henry Clarke . Morissa too . She wanted to see the work with the storm victims that a doctor up there was doing , saving many from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had heard nothing from Tris since before the blizzard , she decided to stay at the bridge a little longer . At Sidney Morissa went to look in on Tom Reeder . He was dead , died during the storm . " Nothing like violent weather to usher a man into the world or out of it , " the surgeon said . Morissa Kirk nodded . But this was more than a patient lost ; this had been her first victory in the wilderness . When she got home the sheriff from Sidney finally came up to look at the saddle Morissa took from the dead horse up in the Snake Creek flat . She wondered why he had n't answered her report but as she talked to the sunburnt officer tilted back in one of her chairs , Morissa discovered why he bothered to come at all : Henry Clarke and Tris Polk had complained about bullets fired on a resident of the bridge community . So he had to make a trip up but not necessarily for information . Besides , Morissa Kirk plainly did not fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no roadranch or dance hall connections . Her doctoring he dismissed with a shift of his cud from one lean cheek to the other . " You let the sick man die , did n't you ? " he demanded . " An ' all the evidence you got for your story of the horse thieves is a saddle you admit you took off a horse you shot , shot from under a man what did n't lay a finger on you ? " Furious , Morissa went to the door and pushed it open . " You forget the man was dying when I arrived , and that I was shot at ? " But the sheriff did not go . Instead he teetered insolently in his chair . " Seems I recall that you fired first , " he said , laughing as at a child or a  | half-wit , but with a threat behind it somewhere , Morissa realized , and wondered what it could be . She realized too , now , that she was helpless . The Sidney sheriff could not be thrown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a voting precinct here to help put him out election time . And although her grandmother once wrote her " Always walk with a prideful foot ? " Morissa went to bring coffee cups and fresh gingerbread . The man seemed to soften up a little ; he spit out his cud and talked a long time as they sat at the pleasant window bordered with blooming geraniums . The roadagents who worked the Cheyenne route , men like Dune Blackburn , Persimmon Bill and Big Nose George , were dangerous men . " We ai n't got bad hombres like them on our trail . Them hideouts like Fly Speck and Cut Lip up ' round Red Cloud Agency there may work down to'ards Sidney but till they does they ai n't my lookout . " He made it clear , however , that he kept track of what went on up there , as well as at the bridge . He heard troops from Fort Robinson had chased Fly Speck Billy last month and repossessed the Indian horses he sold to the miners without a bill of sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take ' nother herd south  --  if you seen one , " the sheriff said , tipping his chair back again , his spurs anchored to the soft pine floor . The young woman considered him as she would a puzzling patient . " I saw the herd , " she said as though she had n't just been called a liar twice . " If it 's Fly Speck somebody should stop him , but I do n't think he does all the stealing . I hear there 's a regular thieves trail across those Snake Creek flats , the horses turned over to some ranchers down the Platte , east of here , who send them on toward Kansas . That gets it close to your Sidney ? " The sheriff pulled out his snap knife and pared a fingernail . Finally he spoke , making it mild . " Have you seen your brother jack lately ? I hear he 's been up around that Red Cloud gang ? " " Oh , I do n't think so , " Morissa replied very quickly , needing to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , Robin Thomas , grading for the new railroad ? " But then her face flushed as she understood the man 's full meaning and his threat , and saw too his bold admiration for her rising color . Angry , she still had to remember that Robin did n't mention Jackie in his last letter and that the boy never wrote , although who could expect an affinity for ink at his age ? " Some Kearney trail outfit may have given jack a ride up , " she explained , thrown off her attack completely . " They cross White River east of Red Cloud , as you know . He likes to visit with Eddie Ellis ? " " Ah , yes , Ellis ? " the sheriff said , his voice tapering off as he let the chair down , shifted his gun and went to talk to Clarke , without a word of good-by or so long .  | When he was gone Morissa stood in the middle of the sunny room looking after his loping horse . Now finally she admitted that something must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a note to Eddie . " There 's always a slice of cake or something waiting for any of Jack 's friends who come past my door , " she told him . Eddie came sooner than she expected . Twice since she moved across the river she had late callers who came sneaking up from the back , out of sight of the trail , and insisted on close-curtained windows before they came into the light . Once it was a bullet that had to be dug out of a man 's calf and once a ball from an old muzzleloader flattened against the scapula . The third time the patient who came out of the unidentifying darkness was her brother . Barely a week after the sheriff 's questions about Jack , Eddie Ellis brought him in , riding double , Jack with his right arm tied up across his breast by a kerchief knotted around his neck . They had been running antelope , trying to rope one . Jack 's horse stepped into a badger hole , snapped off a leg , and threw him over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight story of it , Eddie , as the older , around twentyone by now , the leader in the telling , jack nodding , saying , " Yeh , Sis ? " and " Yeh , down he went ? " The story seemed a little too consistent , without differences or contradictions . Nor would Jack let his sister give him a whiff of ether , although he almost fainted when she set the bone , his face sweat-beaded and so white that his hair looked like a black hood , hanging far down behind , as long as Wild Bill Hickok 's ever was , but straight . Eddie rode away before dawn , saying he must get back to work , although Morissa knew he had lost his job at the agency long ago . But it was fine to have Jackie around for the planting again , handing her the roots with his free arm as she set out a lot of rhubarb , enough for a supply of pleasant physicking sirup , asparagus , so good for the kidneys , and also a large plot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprouts in a trench from which they might grow into a wall of spring purple some day , and the yellow roses in clumps along the gray sod walls . About a week later the Bosler cowboys brought a small bunch of herd sires through . While the men wet their throats at Etty 's , some of the bulls broke down Morissa 's pasture fence and tolled away two of her young heifers . On Appaloosa she went to look for them , hoping that they would be down to the river for water soon although there were still ponds in buffalo wallows over the prairie . She rode out northeast the way the Bosler bulls had gone , to some high ridges that overlooked the sandhills . It was somewhere off this way that the boys had chased the antelope , and when Morissa saw a dozen buzzards circling slowly , she went over and found the horse half-gutted by wolves . It was Robin 's RT brand on  | the shoulder all right , but no broken leg ; instead there was a bullet through the heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shading palm , Morissa noticed old tracks and dry horse droppings leading down the slope that funneled off toward the Platte . There was nothing more except a coyote rising from the edge of a gully , watching her over his shoulder . Morissa rode down that direction with her rifle ready across the saddle . The coyote was too wily but in a washout the earth was worn by animal pads , drawn there by another carcass , that of a man , poorly buried and now half uncovered where wolves had begun at his belly , perhaps as soon as the stink of decay overcame the man smell . Morissa scraped the earth back from the face that was bearded , with an old scar across the corner of the swollen , blackened mouth  --  surely the Cut Lip that the Sidney sheriff had mentioned , Cut Lip Johnson from around Red Cloud . He had at least two bullets through his stocky body , and many would say he had them coming a long , long time . With the big knife left in Cut Lip 's sheath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she slipped her boots and socks off and tramped the earth with her bare feet for the human smell . When she was about a mile on her way home she turned the Appaloosa back to the dead horse and cut out Robin 's brand , haggling it as though wolves had been gnawing there , looking over her shoulder several times and all around the empty prairie , furious that she felt driven to such trickery . Home without the heifers she unsaddled and went in to talk to Jackie . He was reading a fanciful story about Wild Bill Hickok in an old copy of Harper 's Magazine but he finally broke down and admitted that Eddie 's story was a lie . They had hired out to help drive some horses down to the Platte , but when they got a few miles above where his horse lay , they saw a bunch of Sioux bucks come whooping after them , shooting as they rode . One got Jack 's horse , really a work mare and not fast . But the Indians whipped right past him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand them off was killed , the rest got away , letting the horses scatter . " Eddie came back for me when the Indians had whooped their horses off back north , and brought me in . " " Who buried Cut Lip ? " Morissa demanded . For a moment the boy looked at his sister , his young face naked in astonishment and fear . " I do n't know , " he finally admitted . " Eddie went down to help him , too , but he was dead . Eddie 's very brave . " " Bravery is a relative thing . There 's nothing brave about getting a seventeen-year-old boy in with horse thieves . You know what happens to them if they 're caught . Strung up to the first tree , and anybody caught with them , too , for in a country without courts , you 're as guilty as the  | gang you run with , and if an innocent man is hung now and then , that 's the bad luck of his bad judgment . " The boy sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his bony young face drawn and afraid , and yet Morissa knew that her talking was futile . Jackie had understood these things long before she came to the valley , long before she complained about the man hanging at the bridge that Clarke characterized as a dead owl left out to warn others away . " ? You know I have to report this , " she added slowly . " Turn in your own brother ? " the boy said angrily , flushing under the thin bearding . No , she could n't do that , not the only blood kin she had , and so she wrote the sheriff about finding the dead man while hunting stock and left a copy of the letter at Camp Clarke , but nothing more . The next morning she rode out with Lieutenant Larman and two of his bluecoats to bring in the body . No one seemed to care how Cut Lip was killed ; the sheriff did n't come , and so another grave was added to the knoll across the river and one more name put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week Eddie Ellis came back to see Jack and took him out for a long ride , away from Morissa ; it was then that Charley Adams said that Cut Lip had been with Sam Bass in the Deadwood holdup and so she packed Jackie off on the first coach to Sidney and bought him a ticket to his father . Eddie was going to work , Jackie protested . He had a job at Pratt 's ranch up the river . The doctor put her brother on the train anyway . Soon Ed Ellis was tying a team and buggy to the hitchrack at Clarke 's , but Morissa never saw anybody in the seat beside him and nobody questioned his ownership of the outfit  --  the horses marked with what seemed to be an ID skillfully blotted . The freighters looked under their curling hatbrims to the lady doe , but nobody considered stealing horses with the Indian Department brand much of a crime  --  mostly just good business . When Morissa came back from the blizzard and found her cattle fed , her plants saved by the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she must have a hired man . One did not impose on good neighbors like that . She needed a man with a wife or sister , or even a mother  --  preferably a woman who knew something about practical nursing for the patients when Morissa was called away . Perhaps Tom Reeder would not have died from a perforated ulcer as he did at Sidney if she could have kept him here on a strict diet , quiet , feeling secure . It seems he got more and more afraid after the town dogs killed his antelope . No one said where the gold went .  | Morissa knew that the couple she needed must be available , with much unemployment all over the East and wages going down again , the railroads cutting theirs a second time within six months . So she wrote her idea to Robin and to two doctors from her class . Once she thought of writing to the young Dr. Walter Reed who had spoken passionately for a medical career on the frontier . But when she sat down to write him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed their medical group a year ago , such a long , long year ago , and so she only wrote him a greeting , a belated note of thanks for his encouragement . The week after Jackie left the problem seemed solved . Charley Adams said he was through soldiering . Sixteen years was too much . He wanted to file on a homestead here in the valley and bring his wife up from Kansas . But his Ruth was uneasy ; she knew about cattlemen warring against settlers from down there . " I suppose she 's wise to weigh that possibility . There will be difficulties here some day , but if we stick together ? " Morissa said thoughtfully . " You 're a crack shot ; you 'd be very useful then too ? " So Charley sent for his wife and built a bunk and a bureau and chairs for the little ell along the far side of Morissa 's hospital room . Then he went down to enter his claim and brought back a team , wagon , and plow , and a tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertising his homesteading until he had to establish his residence , he said . " A man learns to keep his head down in the Army . " He laid out a new garden plot at Morissa 's dam and that brought enough riders to sit watching him sourly a while and then spur off to the whisky stores instead of laughing at his first breaking , which was choppy as the flooded Platte in a windstorm . But Charley soon learned to handle the bucking sod buster behind his steady-footed old gray mares . By that time Ruth Adams got off the coach at the bridge . She turned out a plain woman with a bleakish face , perhaps from waiting sixteen years for her soldier husband to make a home for her , take her out of hired-girling . She looked at Morissa , tall , slender , and high-busted , her uncovered hair shining like a dark bay filly in the sun , and she went to live in the tent instead of the room Charley prepared for them in the house of this Doctor Kirk woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she sang out there in the tent , about some desperate pilgrim forever crossing flooded waters and the burning sands . But two weeks out there cooled Ruth off a little , Charley whispered to Morissa when he came back from Sidney with a load of wire fencing . Maybe it was being alone through the cold rain of late April in the tent , or perhaps that Morissa 's cat went up to the pond and stayed to rub his back against the woman 's gray calico skirts . Or the medicine the doctor put together for Ruth 's female weakness . Who can say what little wind will veer the set of the mind ?  | When the grass was well started so that turning the sod would kill most of it , Charley went to lay out the ten acres on Morissa 's timberclaim . His breaking rolled back smooth as satin bands now , with blackbirds , gulls , even meadowlarks and killdeers following at his heels , pecking in the new-turned earth . Morissa followed him , too , working in a navy denim jumper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braid hanging below her waist , tied with big pompoms of yellow and mustard-colored yarn . She carried a sack of seedling cottonwood , boxelder and ash slung under one arm , and with the spade she set them out two swinging steps apart , driving the blade deep through the sod , working it back and forth to make a little bed for the rootlets . With her gloved hands she packed earth around them , stepped a firm foot on each side , and then went on to the next , perhaps pausing to wave to a freight train heading north , or some hurrying gold seekers . By this time the riders who stopped to slouch over their saddlehorns were more pointed in their disapproval , telling the city woman about the drought , the hail , and grasshoppers , and the range cattle running loose here . " Oh , there 's the state herd law to protect cultivation from straying stock ? " she reminded them easily . " You mean you expect the courts ' way off at Sidney to make us keep our cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " one of Bosler 's men asked in astonishment . " Well , I have a legal claim to the land , and that 's more than you cattlemen can say for your range , " she said , her teeth white . " But I do intend to fence it as soon as Charley gets the time . " The man looked down at the tall young doctor , at her brown oval face , the hazel eyes luminous with their remote glow , the red lips humorous , and the sway of her body to the spade and the planting as provocative as a dance . But a plot of growing things so close to the bridge and the trail was a serious threat to all the free-range country , and particularly attractive to every disappointed bonanza seeker dragging back down the trail . It was the foreman of the Cradle Six , setting up a new ranch in the Snake Creek country , who finally put it straight to Morissa , and afterward she wondered how many spoke through the usually mild-voiced man who slouched sideways in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . " You remember your first day here , ma'am , " he said over the impatient stomp of his horse , " when Clarke nailed up the dead owl to warn the others off ? ? hanging the first man who threatened his bridge ? " Morissa scraped at a bit of earth clinging to her spade with a chip of flint . So he knew what Clarke had told her . They all worked together . " Are you threatening me ? " she finally trusted herself to ask . " Because if  | you are , let me tell you I 'm from a breed of owls that do n't scare easy . " The man grinned , showing his strong brown teeth pleasantly . " You would n't be no good owl to warn others off , ma'am ; better at tolling ' em , I 'd say , " apparently still wishing to seem gallant . But only for a moment . " Why do n't you grab you a man and quit this switching your skirts around ? " he added . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was funny , and discerning , he pulled his hat lower upon his sun-narrowed eyes . " Why do n't you grab up the Lieutenant and go East  --  before your luck runs out ? Be mighty easy to make a case against you here , you know . Shielding and comfort for outlaws . People have been hung for less . " Morissa noticed that he did n't mention Tris Polk for her , but she did n't overlook the threat that had been spoken so plainly . In the morning she took her rifle out to her tree planting and set it up against the tub of seedlings . It glistened there in the sun of May that was exactly like the sun of a year ago , the day she came to the valley of the North Platte with a new trousseau trunk and a silly little hat with yellow feathers like agitated birds , always trying to escape . The next day a smooth-fingered man from Bosler 's came to offer Morissa $500 for her relinquishments , and when she pointed out that the preemption was paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the three quarters  --  the man raised the price for her departure to $1,000 , " providing you do n't file on another place in the country ? " Morissa smiled . " I like it here ? " and to this the man set his spurs . The doctor looked after him a long time . Now she understood why wolves traveled just under the crest of the ridges  --  where it was easy to disappear , never be a silhouetted target against the sky . All winter there had been news and rumors of Indian battles and now Crazy Horse and the last of his hostile followers were finally driven to the reservations , not by guns so much as by the disappearance of their commissary , the buffalo . With the surrender of the Sioux , the troops began to move out and the passenger coaches from Cheyenne had to fight their way past Robbers Roost and other hideouts free to work in the open again  --  men like Jesse James and his gang along with the regular roadagents ; escaped convicts , deserters , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was the steel-lined Concord coach the stage company at Cheyenne ordered made , on rush . The blizzard that had brought famine and sky-high prices to the isolated Deadwood was followed by a cry that the mines were really done , finished . Now gold seekers coming in were held up for whatever they carried . One party was robbed of their stock and when they tracked the robbers on borrowed horses these were also taken from them , and their  | guns , the men set afoot and unarmed far from food or water . After a while the Cheyenne trail was shortened to avoid the Roost and yet the outlawry grew until the Dakotans did a little rope work . Up near Deadwood three men being held as horse thieves were dragged out of jail by a mob and left hanging for days in the hot sun . " More dead owls , " Morissa said sourly . The lynchings did n't seem to scare anybody . The Cheyenne coaches were still held up , the locks blown off the treasure boxes with gunshot right in the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out , the haul perhaps twelve , fifteen thousand dollars . Stories of a woman riding with the outlaws sifted down to Clarke 's bridge , and then late one night there was the quiet but firm tap of a gun butt against Morissa 's door . In the darkness she opened the middle window a little and looked out , a man vaguely visible in the diffused light of her sign . " You have the wrong place , " she said , keeping her voice down from Ruth . " What you want is available over across the bridge . " " Ai n't you the lady doe ? " " Yes , I am . " Then he had come to fetch her . Sick woman off west here a ways . But when Morissa lit the lamp and held it up to look out , the man stepped back into the shadows , his face hidden between the broad hatbrim and the high collar drawn up . For the first time here Morissa hesitated . " Who is sick , and who are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun he motioned the young doctor outside . " Get on the horse there or I 'll put a bullet through yeh ? " " And then who 'll care for your sick woman ? " Morissa said scornfully . " Plainly you do n't want to go to Sidney , or to the post surgeon at Fort Robinson ? " " No , but if you do n't come you ai n't gon na be feedin ' nobody no more pills ? " That made sense , and so Morissa smiled a little . " If you are afraid to let me know who you are now , what proof is there that I 'll live to tell what I might find out ? " " Oh , that 's easy , Sis . I 'll take an ' blindfold you , in ' n ' out . Please hurry , ma'am , the woman 's a dyin ' . " " Wounded ? " " No , do n't know what 's ailin ' her . " " In pain ? " " She 's feverin ' , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Convulsions , probably . " But Morissa could n't get anything more out of the man , and so she  | said she wanted her own horse and would need Charley Adams , up at his tent tonight . He was a good nurse , good with ether , if it was necessary to operate . " Operate ? " the man said in sudden fear , but he was still adamant . " No , I ai n't takin ' nobody else . " " Then I do n't come . You can blindfold him too . " So with the man slipping up to listen , Morissa woke Charley . " Need you on a call ? " she said . While he dressed and came down she managed to leave an awkward little note written in the dark depths of the trunk where she pretended to dig for medicines : " Taken away with Charley to woman patient off west by threat of gun . Slight man with limp ? " Saddled up , they rode through the darkness , westward apparently . Although there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they left the smell of sweet water and the far pumping sound of the shitepokes . The doctor felt a curious familiarity with such a night ride , and then she remembered the tales her mother told her , long ago  --  about the Scottish highwayman who stole Morissa 's great-grandmother as a girl and carried her a long , long ways in the night . It was almost like reliving the story as it seemed in her childhood , before she knew that the robber had become her great-grandfather , and paid for his adventure by an earthbound life of wife and children and blatting sheep . Toward dawn the man stopped and ordered Morissa to blindfold Charley and then herself , perhaps as her ancestress had her eyes covered on that first ride . Soon another horsebacker met them without word or greeting , only the sound of a horse falling in behind them . When the sun had boiled down hot for hours and the lagging hoofs struck rock , the leader stopped at the sound of a murmuring creek . The Appaloosa drank deeply , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cold sweet water , with the sweet coldness of swift spring flow . Then they followed up this stream and dismounted . Morissa was led over a step into walls , a stinking shack , and told to remove her blind . Although the door had been open , the stench of dead flesh and living putrefaction roiled even the doctor 's empty stomach . As her eyes adjusted themselves to the windowless place , the awkward log walls , greasy with old smoke , came out of the duskiness and she saw a woman on a bunk , only the white skull-face clear . Swiftly Morissa counted the failing pulse and verified her sudden fears . " The man should have told me what was wrong , " she said , angry to be caught so unprepared . " I should have brought things I stopped carrying in this man 's country ? " The woman tried to speak . " They do n't know ? " she finally managed in a breathy whisper . " It was  --  before " her voice stopped , as though frightened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Morissa urged gently .  | Four months , and took sick a week ago . She had done what a woman at Deadwood told her . " I  --  I was afraid , but when I come to  --  come here I could n't have me a  --  a bastard . " Morissa felt herself grow unprofessionally angry . " Do n't use that vile and dreadful word ! " she commanded . " Abuse the father or yourself , but not the innocent . Someone here knew of me ; why did n't you come before this was done ? I would have welcomed you , cared for you both . " But the woman seemed unable to stop now , or to listen . Her voice barely above a whisper , she kept up a murmuring of talk , disjointed , but steady ; driven to it , as though the presence of another woman had broken a winter of ice . Yet always her sunken , fevered eyes sought out the open doorway . Morissa knew she must do what little she could immediately , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who came to stand behind her , his blue neckerchief drawn up across his face when she turned to give him a note . " You better send this to my place if you wo n't go to a pharmacist . Get Mrs. Adams to send me what I want . " " No ! " " Yes ! ? Even now it may be too late . I 'll do what I can in the meantime , but everything may be too late . " For a moment she saw a look of deep apprehension and misery come into the shadowed eyes , of fear and of sorrow that made the woman in the doctor feel rejected and depressed . But she could give only a passing notice to her sudden envy of this affection , and a gladness for it too . She set out the carbolic acid and her instruments on a towel spread over a stump bench and began her task , the woman no more than a girl for all the gaunt and bloated skeleton , the doctor still hoping that the distended abdomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed hopeless after so many days , but Morissa knew that sometimes women become resilient as barbed wire . With the strength of the strenuous , hard life here , along with nature 's wise provision against a direct blood path between the mother and her nested young , a doctor could at least hope . Twice Morissa stopped to give the girl a heart stimulant and finally it was necessary to call Charley , although the watcher outside stood against it . " ? I wo n't have no man in there ! " he commanded . " But Charley is like a doctor . " And when he still resisted , Morissa told him the rest . " Perhaps it wo n't matter now anyway ? " Slowly the man slid a hand down upon the grip of his pistol and then let it fall helplessly , his face convulsed behind the neckerchief mask . So Charley came into the silent shack and closed the door against the deep , choking sobs outside .  | At last they could do no more ; even the final irrigation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , pinned her hair back and hoped that she had done no more harm than good . After a while , when the girl seemed quieter , the man outside brought in a little beef stew with onions and potatoes in it , and Morissa knew it had all been taken from freight and cattle outfits , perhaps as a sort of toll for letting the rest pass . But it was late afternoon now , a long time and a long ride since their last meal , and so Morissa and Charley ate heartily while the girl slept on the bunk , so much like a worn , wasted child . It would be almost morning before a man could return from the Platte if anyone went at all , and that would be too late , or scarcely needed , one way or the other . They took turns beside the girl in the low lantern light , watching particularly for signs of the convulsions the man had described , but toward midnight the breathing became deeper , more regular and Morissa 's hand found the forehead cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At her first move , the man outside was peering in the crack of the door . She nodded reassuringly and awoke Charley to show him the change in the smoky light . " If you stay out here long enough there will be women , families , all over the region , " she said . " An old army nurse like you might as well learn to know the signs . Besides ? " Yes , besides the signs of a turn in a woman were like anybody 's . By the next afternoon it was plain that no one had been sent on Morissa 's errand but , with the patient very much better , the two were blindfolded again and led away . The girl had cried softly as she clung to Morissa 's hand , not speaking , and the young doctor choked back the advice that rose in her : " Go home , wherever that is " for who could see the life of young Dr. Morissa Kirk of the gold trail this moment and not say to her also , " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the log shack the man had laid five double eagles in her hand , heavy , glistening new gold , and when Morissa objected to the amount , he said , " Interest comes correspondingly high as the risk in-creases ? " " But you are an educated man ! " Morissa exclaimed in surprise . Immediately the outlaw returned to his surly , illiterate speech behind the blue cloth , with the anger of an actor who has slipped in his part . So , blindfolded again , they rode out and after a while more hoofs came , more clink of bridles until there were at least five men around them , silent , riding in the darkness of Morissa 's blind . Could their silence mean she might recognize a voice ? At the least an escort of this size seemed ominous , even though the man had promised their safe return ? the promise of a roadagent.  | Morissa heard nothing of Charley for so long that she wanted to call out to him , discover if he was still along . She coughed once , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal , only a sudden break into a canter , and she had to trust Appaloosa to prepare her for any sudden turn or jump as she clung to the knob of the sidesaddle with her knee until her leg was numb and her back seemed broken from the heavy bounce and jolt of the ride in total darkness . But there were worse things on her mind  --  with five outlaws around them , perhaps only around her , blindfolded , unarmed , alone with night surely near and the country as empty as the night . But after a long winding stretch Morissa sensed that the hoofbeats were lessening until there seemed only one man , and Charley , if he was there . Finally the outlaw spoke . " You kin jerk the blind , Miss ? " It was dark , the big dipper out clear for early night , and the Appaloosa pulling against the bit for home now that he felt the returned assurance of his rider . Without another word the man swung away into the darkness . " If things do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me at once ? " Morissa called after him , and did not know whether he heard . When they got home Ruth was at the stable to meet them pretending not to cry that her Charley was back . Morissa saw a horse standing near the gate beyond , and Tris was waiting on the bench before the lighted doorway , with the night sweetness of four o'clocks and mignonette all around . " We 've been very uneasy about you , after a Wyoming outlaw was seen riding this way couple days ago by Pratt 's men , and Ruth found your note ? " he said sternly . " Oh , nobody 's going to hurt me , " Morissa said as she stretched herself wearily on the low bench . For a long time Tris stood against the doorjamb , silent as though listening to the comforting song of the frogs . " I ran into your heifers , up near where you left your buggy in the blizzard , " he finally told her . " In with the Bosler herd . I had them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tris . " Morissa tried to make herself recall why she should have heifers astray but she was too worn out tonight . The man did not seem to listen to even the little she said . " I ca n't have you going on like this , Morissa , " he protested angrily . " Out nights , kidnaped by outlaws . Next month is the Walker horse show and you 're going to marry me there . "  | MORISSA WAS RETURNING FROM A CALL ON A SMALL GIRL OVER beyond the mountain lion pass when she saw troopers riding across the bridge two abreast . Behind them came a row of mounted Indians , a few wagons , and a long string of people walking , many bent to the bundles on their backs  --  men , women , and children , and far behind these a little beef herd stirring up a dust . She stopped and knew what it was . Three days ago Lieutenant Larman said he had an unhappy order , to help start a thousand Cheyennes on their transfer down to Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to walk across Nebraska and Kansas and farther  --  all moving like dead ones , a beaten people driven from their homes , going into exile . Suddenly the young doctor 's face was scalded with tears and such a fury rose in her that she had to whip her horses , holding them close until they reared and plunged , froth flying from the bits . Then she let them out and they leapt ahead , jerking the buggy along in a lope until she got control of herself and set the whip into the stock and was ashamed . But she knew it would be a long , long time before the guilt of this was washed from the grass where their moccasins had moved . The Indians camped south of the river , setting up a few ragged skin and canvas lodges , the rest to sleep out . The women scattered for wood , where for the last three , four years every stick and twiglet had been searched out . It was late when they returned and what wood they brought was through troopers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drag it in from the bluffs . And after the evening smoke one of the men came over the bridge to Morissa with a child at his side , a shy , dark-eyed little boy , the baby she had saved last year . Evidently they had not found food in the south either , and had returned , and now must retrace the long road . By signs the man asked permission to go to the small pasture where the Appaloosa grazed . " Talk with horse , " his signs conveyed to Morissa , and she quickly smiled and nodded and he went to squat beside the animal , silent , it seemed , for a long time before he touched him at all , and held the small boy up for the horse to smell . Impulsively Morissa ran out . " I give it you ? " she motioned . The Indian smiled sadly and shook his head . " They take from me ? white man take all horse ? " he said , and then he touched Morissa 's hand and guided it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | her fingers up and down until the Appaloosa closed his eyes and stretched his head forward , like a cat rubbed on the back . But the Indian could not take the horse . It had been a trade , the horse traded for the life of his son , and he would never have that undone . " How sensible , " Morissa caught herself thinking as she went back to the house and left the man there until the night darkened and the fireflies laced the riverbank . The next morning the doctor saw the queue start southward , and heard a thin clear keening . She wondered what death had now occurred among them . She wondered too , at some other things  --  notably how much fear the Crazy Horse Sioux , with a small fraction of these Indians along , had struck into the hearts of the whites when the very arms with which they fought had to come from the enemy white man . Of course it was blown up by the contractors behind the great bull trains of goods to the armies rousted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper lay there  --  some relation between the pursued and the pursuer , the transgressor and the transgressed . Robin 's grading for the railroad was put off for the same reason that railroad employees got their wages cut again  --  because times were hard enough so it could be done ; had to be done , the owners said . But the trainmen protested the action by a strike that spread out of the East to Chicago and St. Louis and now toward Omaha . President Hayes , insecure in his office because he won it from Tilden against the electoral vote , was in a panic . He called out the Army to put down the strike ? the revolution as he called it . Robin came back to the valley half decided to file on a homestead . Perhaps Jack , left behind to look after the equipment , would be twentyone in time for some free land too . With nine quarters of their own , debt free , the three of them could make a living in cattle and farming , even with an occasional year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor bills . He talked late into the night about this and about the boy , and while Morissa dropped a hint or two of Jack 's bad associations around Red Cloud , she could not say all she knew of the horse stealing . " Why do n't you send him for a visit to your father in Kentucky ? " she suggested once . " Or to school somewhere ? " Robin got up and tapped the ashes from his pipe into the hearth of the cold stove . " He wo n't go unless I make him , and I ca n't do that . " " Well , then we 'll have to try it here , " Morissa agreed . " Eddie Ellis has a top buggy and seemed to be looking for a girl but he 's running with that Doc Middleton who used to work up at Pratt 's , too , before he turned horse thief . I would prefer not to have Jackie here just now ? " Robin eased a hand over his stiff gray brush of beard and kept his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another cowboy with a broken leg and a gambling woman from Deadwood with summer quinsy . Next day he came hurrying back from Clarke 's as soon as the stage was in , bringing news to Morissa at her tree planting . One of the new settlers down west of Sidney was found shot between the shoulders , and his little claim shack dragged into a draw with lariats . It seemed he was caught eating beef , with no cows of his own . " Must a man die because he might have bought or begged a chunk of meat ? Even if he stole it , the range stock was probably eating his grass , " Morissa defended hotly . " The Boslers tolled off two of my heifers . Should I have gone out and shot the men ? " This deserved no reply and Robin gave it none . Instead he spoke of the coming rush of settlers West , with so much unemployment and the hard times . Looked to him like the homeseekers this spring were only a first spilling over at the dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if it meant war here as it did back in Custer County , near the new railroad . Morissa told her stepfather nothing of the Bosler threats but as he talked she led him down the rows of young trees . There were a few bare streaks , the trees gone , particularly along the better end , the one reached by the little irrigation ditch . Morissa had found the fence cut several times with tracks of running horses across the plot , trees pulled out and dropped all along them , as though cowboys had leaned from their saddles and jerked them up as they spurred through . So she had drawn big skulls and crossbones with stove polish on boxboard and tacked them up on fence posts , one at each side of the patch . When she saw anyone come riding across the prairie toward the trees , she went out and put a couple more bullet holes into the skulls with her rifle . She had to steady the gun on top of the yard gatepost for that distance , but the bullet went where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afixin ' to be picked off on the range one a these days ? " some were saying . There was still the rancher Polk on her side , Sid Martin , too , with his neck out of its leather brace now , and Clarke of the bridge as well as a dozen others who wanted the young woman out of the country as a homesteader but owed her too much as a doctor to push the matter . At least not yet . Robin wondered how much of this the girl realized , but he would not be the one to bring it up . Before she took the homestead , yes , but now that she was committed to it , he would not be the one to make her waver , fail in this , when so much ground had already slipped under her young feet . Tris Polk , like the other cattlemen , sent his roundup wagons to the Walker ranch for their summer horse show . He had an extra house tent  | brought along for his two pretty Texas cousins and their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a cheval glass and dressing table as ladies required . With a little trouble he got the ranch cook into a white cap and willing to set up a folding table , with flowers beside the breakfast biscuits . Then he drove over for Morissa Kirk and , because she had Charley and his serious-faced Ruth to look after her patients now , to dispense physics and digestatives or bandage a wound , she went . Appaloosa was tied beside the buggy team , Morissa 's green riding habit and her plumed hat in the valise under the buggy seat . Neither Tris nor the girl spoke of last year 's preliminary show , in which Morissa was to ride even though the Carlotta saddle did not arrive in time . By that show time sod had been broken on her homestead , and the rancher 's horse pawed no flies at her gate but was up at Deadwood with the beef herd or carrying Huff Johnson 's Gilda over the new mountain trails . Now the rancher helped Morissa into his shining buggy . " This is a proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young doctor smiled . The show grounds lay on a little half-dry creek on the north Sidney table , the long scattering of log buildings and corrals among a few cottonwoods , with the shimmer of dust over it in the hot afternoon sun . Out a ways was what seemed a tent and wagon city of visitors , with a little circle of Sioux lodges , the smoke of their cooking fires twisting upward . Cowboys rode here and there , their loping horses kicking up spurts of dust . Some whooped in little herds of bulls or calves for the contests in cutting , roping , and tying . Horses were brought in , too , those for the races led in , the wild herds loose , sunfishing as they came , turning this way and that , always a fast , wily mare in the lead and quick to slip out at the slightest opening , the others close at her heels . Morissa was welcomed almost as a betrothed and kissed with Southern exuberance by Auntie Mae and then by Li-Laurie and Li-Annie as Tris called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but without the stormy darkness of their uncle 's , lighted instead by the baby-soft fluffs of pale curls . The girls already had a following among the young men of the ranch country , one a reserved young Englishman with sun-bleached hair and very good financial connections , Li-Laurie whispered to Morissa , while the colored maid smiled softly as she laid out moon-white dresses for the girls , and Morissa 's india muslin , yellow as ripe corn . After the early supper they all moved across the slanting sunlight toward the big dance pavilion of new pine . The fiddlers and a dulcimer tuned up , and the Sioux came marching up in single file to watch . Morissa wondered once if Tris realized the story of her parentage , perhaps from Calamity Jane 's remark , and thrust it from her mind as she swung from his arms to those of some young Englishman , to Colonel Walker , or to Sid Martin , whose neck turned easily enough to look after Tris 's laughing Auntie Mae from Texas . Morissa danced once with  | young Ellis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but spoke intense , angry words into her ear . " If I was a few years older I 'd trample that Tris Polk in the dust gettin ' to you ? " Morissa laughed . " Ah-h , Eddie ! That Texas sweet-talk seems to be catching . Why do n't you try it on one of the pretty Southern girls ? " He seemed embarrassed and was silent , and afterward every time Morissa turned his way , she saw the pale , hurt eyes following her . From the short dancing they scattered through the moonlight to the big fire at the Sioux camp , with the drumming and the songs , the feathered and painted dancers in their curious backslip steps and their leapings to the hand drums . Afterward there was the dance of the young people . The girls drew the men in as was their custom . Here and there they reached out for a white man , too , coquettish in their daring , and so Tris was swept away from beside Morissa , joining in as though he had been there often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his highheeled boots among the soft moccasins , and then they were grabbed too and whirled along in a running , flying circle around the fire until the dancers fell apart , laughing , holding their sides , Indians and all . After the return to the tents , Aunt Mae took Morissa 's arm and led her out into the moonlight for a little walk , and when they returned past the silent wagons standing in their deep shadows , she sat down on one of the tongues , easy as any old gold trailer at eveningtime . " ? But I have been a boomer too , " she protested when Morissa said this . " I was scarcely more than a bride when we went down the Santa Fe trail , Illinois to Texas , sitting on the wagon tongues a spell every night before we crept into our beds for the early morning start . " " Well , you are a pioneer ! " " And so are you , in this new country and also in a new field for women . I am very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face grew warm in embarrassment . " I  --  there 's nothing settled ? " she had to say . " I know , but you will marry . Tris is a fine man . He 's had to give up , too , in his life . His father and my George were killed together the first year of the war , although our hearts were still with the North ? " she paused a little , to steady her voice , and it was so much like Tris , this self-restraint , that a sudden warmth for him flooded over Morissa . But even now there was another man in her mind , his arm about her as she could n't forget , standing beside her looking down over the golden autumn on the Missouri . But Aunt Mae 's soft voice was firm again . " ? We die for our neighbors in their need , whether we know it or not , and so my husband and his brother died for our neighbors in Texas . Then Tris , the only man left of our two families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | engineering . He had to get into his chaps , round up our scattered stock from the brush , set the two ranches back on their feet . But with the war over , there was all this beef and so he started north to market with one of the first big herds . He was only a small stockman among the others , a seventeen-year-old and new to such rough men and to fighting outlaws and Indians , but he learned . When he saw all the grass up here eight years ago he located the TeePee ranch for what is left of the family ? we four . He has done well for us here . Now there 's that new packing house he plans to go into with Forson from Chicago . I think you met them . Tris says it may make us all rich , very rich . " She stopped and in the moonlight Morissa saw the pretty woman draw her wrap about her shoulders in satisfaction , as though it were already ermine . " I 'm glad to hear this good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He has n't said much about it to me . " " You do n't need money as we do , my dear . The twins and I  --  But do n't you think that handsome young English boy is drawn to Laurie ? It would be so pleasant to have good connections in England , and money helps a great deal there . Tris says the boy is from a financial syndicate but only an employee  --  although he is the second son of an earl , " she hastened to add . The camp stirred early , the men setting the fires in the barbecue pits at daylight to get the coals ready for the meat , a steady and clean broiling without smoke . By ten the August sun was shimmering on the Sidney table , and little heat dances played along the west . " A burning day for a lady 's delicate complexion , " Aunt Mae warned . " Do n't go out without a good dusting of talcum , girls , and do hold your parasols low , over the eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue ruffles on a stick coquettishly sideways over a pretty brow . They went to the race track and from there to the corrals and sat with Colonel Walker 's visiting wife and young daughter-in-law under a row of military awnings . A dozen or more other women and girls were there , more than the range country ever saw together before . There was a thin scattering of pretty dresses along the fence and at the corral walls , too , just a scattering among the hundreds of men , mostly sunburnt and bighatted , with a few paler visitors from Sidney and farther east . Everybody from the region was represented except the settlers ; Morissa , as far as she could see , the one exception , but tolerated as the range 's only doctor . Although Walker had a homemade sprinkler wagon to lay the dust on the circular track , there was plenty to blow in from the dry August prairie and from the bare space inside the track , too , where running horses seemed aimlessly driven back and forth , Indians whipped their mounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazers got  | organized to help protect the broncho busters later . Tris was in much of this , here and there on the white-stockinged Cimarron , a single-footer in this show place , his rider sitting as easy as in a rocking chair , the nieces crying , " Oh , Uncle Tris , you are so handsome , you and that black , black horse ! " until Morissa could n't decide if it was native Texas exuberance or a little Southern scheming . Tris laughed it off . " You wait until you see Morissa 's horse ? " he called back to them . But he really was a fine figure on Cimarron , Morissa had to admit , in his new pale chaps and hat , gray as silver dust , the black shirt set off by the flowing yellow silk kerchief knotted behind his neck , the fringes of his embroidered gloves barely stirring as he rode . The show started gradually , with an easy Western casualness . Colonel Walker and his redheaded daughter-in-law led out on Kentucky mares , the Colonel riding English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old cow waddies . " Look at ' im ! The cunnel a bobbin ' up ' n down like some jack rabbit hitting for the brush ! " " Yeh , an ' thet there 's a mighty good horse , only cai n't no horse look good under them flapjack saddles ? " But there were hearty handclappings from the special guests , and a cry of " Bravo ! " Behind the Walkers came other ranchers from the region riding good Western saddles , Tris on his black between his pretty nieces in wine-colored habits on silver-maned buckskins . Businessmen from Sidney and beyond mostly rode stock saddles too , but were plainly not grown to them , although the few women with them sat their sidesaddles well . There were four visiting officers in army blue , followed by the race horses , and then the bronch riders , a dozen or so . Behind them came the Mexican bullfighter , walking past in solitary grandeur in his silver embroidery , the two picadors at his heels bareback on old stove-up chore horses , each with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , the men in paint , their feather headdresses blowing in the light wind , the women with their pony drags and small children in skin sacks . Finally the real backbone of the cattle business came past : a thick crowding of cowboys and ranch hands with rope and gun and branding iron , followed by the cook and bed wagons , and a calf wagon , too , with a couple of bawling dogies looking out the slats . Tris even got Eddie Ellis away from the women and up on a horse . The calf roping began , with a couple of bowlegged cowboys trying to keep a calf away from the fence for the roper . " Awkward as a Scotsman holding a pig in an alley ? " Morissa remembered her mother saying once , and she laughed with the others as the little brindle dogie dove between this pair of barreled knees and that one to escape the zinging loop . But finally the calves were all neatly footed with the intelligent help of the roping horses or caught around the neck and dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ races were called , with a free-for-all-corners , and Bat 's Blue , the blue roan from up near Red Cloud Agency , was led out . Now the Indians became interested ; one by one they got up , walked solemnly to their betting post and threw down beaded robes , shirts , pipe bags and even knives and moccasins on the blue roan to win , matched by goods and tobacco and money on the other side of the post . " Ai n't you runnin ' the ' Paloosy ? He 's mighty fast ? " one of the passing cowboys called to Morissa , his teeth white in his brown , laughing young face . A pistol shot finally started the horses . The Kentucky stock drew out ahead , followed by the fast cowponies and then the slower-starting Blue , with a dwarfed and twisted little Indian riding him bareback , riding with only a jaw rope , riding all over the shaggy horse , whipping to both sides with the knotted end of his rope , whooping every few jumps . He was the clown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the leaders , but as the laps piled up the Blue 's tough distance blood began to show . Then suddenly the heels of the hunched little Indian went deep into the Blue 's flanks as he lay close to the back . The horse lengthened out , too , his belly close to the ground . Running like a scared coyote for his life , he shot past the fine blooded saddlers , the race horses , and the whole band of Indians whooped to see it , as well as some of the whites . Finished , the rider came down on the jaw rope and set the Blue on his haunches in the dust . Then he turned back to the judges to receive the applause and the ribbon that the Indian tied into the mane , one more ribbon to go with the dozen already feathering the show gear of Big Bat 's wife when she rode the Blue in their ceremonial parades . Now the Sioux came marching up in formal file to carry away their wagers and everything from the other side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kerchiefs , bridles , tobacco , and gold coins thrown down there . The other races were less fun but more fitting to Colonel Walker and his special guests . There was the star-faced Neptune , a descendant of the all-time finest , the unbeatable Eclipse , besides half a dozen others of fine blood from the ranches toward Denver and Cheyenne . " Better watch that fancy stock here for horse thieves . They been operating right at the tracks off down in the middle of the state ? " Sid Martin was telling Morissa from his horse when one of his cowboys came up , embarrassed at the need to interrupt . " A Seven U rider got a knee kicked , Boss . Mebby ? " So Sid walked over with Morissa , leading his horse , the girl holding up the long side of her green habit , the feathers of her hat blowing . Then he loped off to the tent for her little black bag . But while Morissa was kneeling beside the horsebreaker , examining what seemed a cracked  | kneecap , a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am Doctor Meddows , " he said importantly , and elbowed Morissa aside . " This here is Dr. Kirk , " one of the awkward cowhands managed to say . The goateed man looked up . " Ah , Dr. Kirk ? ? a midwife , no doubt , " he said and fell to straightening out the leg , feeling the bone . Morissa walked away and later Sid came riding by to apologize . " I hate that happening , ma'am . Meddows has hung up a shingle on one of those chicken ladders leadin ' up over the saloons in Sidney . Just a big blowhard , I hear . " " He 's probably all right ; a lot of doctors still act that way , " Morissa said quietly , " but I was taught a different courtesy to a fellow physician . " They started back along the fence , past the race horses tied out to leave the corrals free for the wild stuff and the rodeo stock . Morissa wanted to stop with them a little , to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sid spurred ahead into it as a sharp pistol shot cut the air , then more , with yells and shouting . Morissa grabbed her skirts and ducked behind the nearest horse , clinging to his mane , patting his shoulder to quiet him as she looked under the neck . Three men with bandanas drawn up across their noses , guns smoking , their horses rearing , had charged in among the racers and leaned right and left to cut them loose . As help came running from every direction , shooting too , the horse thieves swept off half a dozen of the best , firing back from their hurrying dust into the horses left behind , to set them rearing and plunging . Then they were gone down a gully , with at least twenty men hot after them , and a hundred more swinging into saddles . But in ten minutes or so the pursuers all came back . The thieves had switched saddles to the racers leading their own , much slower horses , which they could release any time if pushed too hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . Besides , there were a dozen ambush places toward the Sidney breaks to think about , where the thieves could pick them off one by one . So a man was started to Sidney immediately with the description of the horses , including the star-faced Neptune , and as much as could be ascertained about the thieves , although no two agreed on whether the men were dark or light , tall or short . Every Westerner noticed the horses carefully but they were the regular chute-run of bays and sorrels probably picked without markings to stick in the mind . No one expected to recapture the stock . The same thing had happened off East several times the last year . Then suddenly there was another shouting out near the race horses , and a call of " Tris Polk ! " In the dust beside the excited , faunching horses still rearing and kicking , Sid had found the young doctor , face down and a streak of blood in her hair .  | " Morissa , Morissa ? " Tris said softly , pushing the dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes almost at once , sat up groggily . " Oh , my head ! Did I get kicked ? " Then as her hand found a furrowed wound through her hair she exclaimed , " Why , it feels like a creasing from a bullet ! ? Oh , I remember now . Bullets from the horse thieves , to upset the stock . " It was true , for two horses were bleeding , neither serious  --  one a nicking on the hip and the other with a bullet half an inch under the skin of the belly and easy to draw out with the point of a knife while the horse was held by half a dozen willing men . " The dirty outfit  --  shooting good horses like that ? " a ranch hand said angrily , and was mystified by the laughing . " You do n't mind ' em shootin ' Doc ? ? " somebody called , and the man 's face grew red . So Tris took Morissa to the tent , Aunt Mae hurrying after them , her blue parasol forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , quiet and capable . But except for the little hole in her hat , a headache , and the soreness where the scalp was split across the top of her head , Morissa was n't hurt . The maid brushed the dust from her clothing and with her wound disinfected and her face washed , she went out to all the excitement over these arrogant horse thieves  --  a story that the Eastern and foreign guests would be telling their grandchildren fifty years from now . There was a great deal of anger too and finally even Colonel Walker spoke in favor of hanging . Any horse thief caught clown here would be hanged as surely as up around Deadwood . Confronted by such bold outlawry , it was time to get together . Vigilantes , regulators  --  that was what they needed . But there was still the horse show to carry on , and the colonel led his guests out to watch a little of the broncho busting . " Do n't you get on any of those wild things ! " Aunt Mae called to Tris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride the most dreadful outlaws at sixteen , seventeen , and just make them buck ! " she said to Morissa . The girl shook her head . " I do n't think he will now , unless it 's necessary . At his age you leave it to the professional horse breakers and the young show-offs . " " I know , " Aunt Mae nodded , still keeping her eye his way , " but with this dreadful excitement you ca n't tell about men ? " At the big pole corral the horses were roped , one after another , eared down and saddled . Then the gate was thrown open , and the sky broke over them as the ropes were released , the blind snapped away , and the wild horse found himself on his feet and loaded with leather and man . Now it was a fight to the finish .  | There were half a dozen hazers to keep the bucking stock away from the fences and the people , with Tris Polk among those who looked after the riders , lifted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind and dangerous run across the holes of the open prairie . Once Morissa cried out within herself as a cowboy went off an endswitching bucker and sprawled into the dust , the horse still pitching on top of the man , trying to rid himself of the saddle right there , coming down again and again , head between his knees , all four feet together , over the dark little bundle that was lying curled up motionless as a rabbit , and none could tell if this stillness was nerve or death . After what seemed a winter 's age , Tris 's rope got the horse , head down and hard to snag , and jerked him away , crashed him to the ground . Once more Morissa found herself wholly the doctor , running to a patient , but then she remembered the frock coat and goatee of Dr. Meddows , and stopped as men hurried in from all directions to pick up the thrown rider . His clothing was in tatters but he was certainly the luckiest man alive , for he was not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as she eased the ache of her head with a palm against her temple , but such luck must not be pushed . So she went to the tent for a while , too nervous now to watch this risk of fine sound bodies on wild horses . Before long it was noon and the barbecue cooks were calling " Come and get it ! " Everybody trooped over to the long tables of planks laid on salt barrels with stacks of tin plates , cups , and cutlery laid out , where men with long gleaming knives sliced into barbecued halves of steers , brown and fragrant . Others piled hot dutch-oven biscuits , pit-baked potatoes and beans on the tin plates , and ladled out canned tomatoes and coffee and cut the great pies of raisins and dried apple . The special guests went to the tables and benches at the shade tents , the rest sat around on the grass with no protection from the sun but their big hats , as on any other day . Afterward there was steer roping and tying , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free-for-all , and the relays with half-broken horses . There was the cook wagon race , too , with half a dozen ranches represented . The tail gate of the leader flew open in the wild swaying run ; pots , pans , kettles , tin plates , and an open flour sack scattered out over the race track as the cook , standing at the dashboard , whipped his galloping horses with the line ends to win . There was a cow-milking contest , the winner bringing in half an inch of milk in the bottom of a beer bottle , and a cowboy foot race , the crowd whooping at the awkward bowlegged runners stumbling along on their crookedheeled boots . Finally it was time for the bullfight , the novelty of the day to all but the south Texans and the few Mexican trail herd riders . The bull turned out to be an old buffalo with a rope around his wooly middle ,  | the mat of hair thick over his forehead so he could n't have seen anything even if nature had given him sharp eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race track , where he stood sniffing the air , his bony tail up ready to run , but baffled and turning . Then he got wind of the bullfighter , not ten feet away , and charged to send him scurrying in his funnel-bottom pants . But all the man had to do was to slip sideways out of the wind as the bull passed , and then stopped in confusion when the scent was lost . The picadors came whipping up with their pitchforks , not to jab the thick hide but to hold the dirty old red underwear fastened to the tines up where the keen-nosed old bull could get the man smell . They drew him to charge foolishly this way and that , making the range workers roar with laughter . In the meantime the bullfighter swung his cape at the poor creature until he began to bellow in frothing anger . Finally the man gave a leap and was up on the buffalo 's back , hanging to the belly rope with both hands as the stiff old animal tore off across the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back this way and that to free himself , the picadors pounding their old plugs along far behind until the hazers rode out and carried the bullfighter back . The old buffalo was left a dark spot in the prairie , standing , worn out . Now the more formal numbers of the afternoon were brought on . A new Concord stagecoach came first , the six white horses in their silver trappings , the driver maneuvering them like a turning toy , their step never broken , no trace or singletree dragging as he cut his winding circles and figure eights . Then he lashed the horses into a run as masked cowboys came in the hot pursuit of roadagents , their shooting returned by blanks from the Winchesters of the guards riding the box . The crowd , not sure now that this was only a show , sat silent as two cowboys fell , rolling off as they would from a runaway horse , to be picked up by the others at top speed the way Indian warriors rescue the fallen . When the coach had escaped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests ; the colonel 's daughter-in-law and two of the handsome young Britishers stepped out , a little dizzy but laughing , to the cheers of the crowd , who were now finally reassured . Next the colonel and his friends and the cavalry officers showed their gaited saddlers , and then the Walker cowboys lugged out jump gates and stood back while the horses took them like great birds , the hired hands from other ranches laughing their hats off their heads , but respectful too . It cai n't be easy stickin ' on like that with them postage stamp saddles ? " Then there was the showing of handsome horses , but less impressive with the best of the imported stock , including Neptune , gone , and in the hands of unknown horse thieves . There was the fine Kentucky blood of the ranch owners , and the cavalry horses all freshly curried and  | shining . Ridden past two and two , they were turned slowly to show all sides to the crowd , their poise , their balance , their beauty of color and conformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his stockinged black was paired with the young Walker daughter-inlaw in black habit on a gleaming silver-white Arabian . Now it was time for Morissa , but instead of being with her horse she was up at the tent , talking to a gaunt-faced man who had ridden in on a lathered old crowbait that had no place on the Walker ranch today . At the repeated call to the show ring , she finally gathered up her skirts and ran , riding out alone on her Appaloosa with the shining silvermounted saddle . " Made for the Empress Carlotta of Mexico , but her whole outfit was driven out by the revolution before it was finished , " Aunt Mae told everyone around her . " Finest example of Texas saddlery in the world ? " The Appaloosa was slowed to show his delicate Arabian head , his light eyes , the dark gray body with the lightish , elaborately spotted hindquarters , as though covered by some royal brocaded drapery . The ornate rose patterns of silver glistened on the black saddle leather , the young woman handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow ostrich tips on her tilted hat , her dark hair gleaming with the curious golden light against her brown skin and high coloring as she turned her dramatically beautiful horse . " Remarkable ! Good seat and carriage , just after she was knocked over by a bullet , too , " one of Colonel Walker 's British friends exclaimed . " Carlotta would not have made a more regal appearance reviewing her regiment , " he added , almost regretfully . The Polk twins left their admiring youths and came running along the fence like children , the long riding skirts held high , crying , " Oh , lovely , lovely ! " in their extravagant Southern way while their mother came sedately behind , as was proper in a chaperoning lady , but smiling her warmth . At the corral Tris helped Morissa from her horse and held her in his arms an instant before all the grinning cowboys . " So it 's settled you 'll marry me at the dance tonight , " he said lightly , making his voice matterof-fact for the listeners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a cowboy preacher and all the trimmings , even a ready-made shivaree , I suspect . " Morissa looked up into the man 's face , into the gray eyes , darkening like a summer storm , and for a moment he was a warm blur to the girl , everything a wavering and a shimmer like sun on moving water . But she made herself stand away . " I ca n't , " she said slowly looking down so her feathers hid her eyes . " The man that 's waiting at the tent came for me . Typhoid 's hit the trail north , one man dead and five more  | bad cases , and several developing . I have to start home right away ? do n't you see , Tris ? A doctor would be no wife for you . " But as the man let her turn away , there was sadness in her , as though something fine was left here , finished , cut off . And at the tent there was another horsebacker to ride up the trail with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him , to have his inconsequential talk to divert her thoughts from their foolish self-concern . XI MORISSA 'S GRAY CAT SAT ON THE DOORSTEP LICKING HIS SIDES , for the garden had drawn ground squirrels and gophers from all the dry prairie around . There was much talk and rumoring about the horse thieves who swept off the best stock at the Walker race track , with many speculations about the identity of the men . Plainly they were professionals and probably familiar with the country , Fly Speck Billy maybe , or Doc Middleton , or somebody with an accomplice among the guests there  --  the eyes turning toward the hitchrack at Clarke 's , where Eddie Ellis had tied his buggy so often this summer . Big rewards were posted for the horses returned in good condition , and for the capture of the thieves , dead or alive , but nobody planned to get fat on a cent of this money . Charley Adams took special precautions with Morissa 's horses , as did everyone around the bridge now . " Hang a noose over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't inside , that 's my motto , " he said , as he whistled the Appaloosa up for a can of oats and then took him through the darkness over into his tent for the night . Ruth worked at it too from the back door , feeding Etty 's big white-faced dog Blaze in the evenings until he began to stay for the pan he got in the morning . Morissa was too busy to know much of what was being done . Typhoid struck like heavy charges of buckshot scattered over the prairie . Even with five green hands near the Water Holes station down , people living along the trail still argued that their wells were the sweetest , coldest in the world , their creeks and spring holes , too , although a little green with August scum as happened every year . How could they suddenly be poison now ? It reminded Morissa of what Dr. Reed had said : " There is so little that we can do for the many typhoid sufferers through the frontier  | regions ? " But most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping to something stronger . Fortunately , too , Morissa had Charley and Ruth for her six bed patients , the one with smallpox isolated in the lean-to she added on the north for a pesthouse . With so much driving , the doctor had another young team broken out from her growing herd , hired a driver , and tried to sleep between stops . Many of the patients were heartbreaking , men for whom little indeed could be done beyond keeping the ranch cooks from feeding them fried beef and beans . Hours of sponging reduced the fever a little , but soon the temperature crept up again , so Morissa tried to keep them in wet sheets with only the blandest food  --  milk , where possible , eggnog , rice water , cloth-strained oatmeal , a little beef broth perhaps , and a lot of white pudding . Once a bench-legged old cook pushed his hat back and spit into the dust when he heard this diet . Maybe he ought to serve it on a goldarn doily ? " That would be nice . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then laughed aloud . Throughout the nation , even with hospital care , one out of every four typhoid patients was dying . Morissa refused to accept such mortality ; she drove and rode night and day , clinging to each man like a buffalo burr to a wooly pup , visiting the convalescing regularly to avoid foolish relapses and urging that all drinking water be boiled . " Carry a tin cup , make a grass fire ? " " Yeh , do n't pay for a minute of drinking on your belly at some water hole with six months on your back ? " Charley added . The prevalence of malarial fever helped spread the typhoid panic until almost half the calls really required no more than a few quinine powders but Morissa did n't dare refuse to go . When Tris Polk returned from Chicago she was just coming into the yard from such a night call to a Bosler camp , the despised settler welcome enough now that men were dying all around . She was so worn that Tris lifted her from the buggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask how his packinghouse deal was going , and barely to appreciate the goodness of this man . Yet was it goodness or only that he left the dirty work against the settlers to his energetic ranch foreman , Morissa wondered wearily . Either way he should be married . Surely women were not scarce back in his Texas , where so many young men had gone to war , and surely too the canny Southern girls must see the good catch the rancher was . After Tris was gone Morissa wondered if she was taking the Texan 's sweet-talk too seriously . He was a determined man ; perhaps he was just getting the one settler north of the river out , even if it took marriage to do it . Or did these questionings , these doubts , rise out of some deep urge to self-destruction lying within her ? Before the doctor could settle herself to sleep there was another burricd  | kick at the doorjamb and once more she started out , keeping herself awake with a jug of cold tea under the buggy seat . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wells and was down too . She had even tried Fish Head , but he ran off at the mouth like a gully washer and got at the brandy she carried for her patients . Jackie did n't write , and Eddie Ellis had n't come past when Morissa heard that one of the Sam Bass gang was shot trying to hold up the Cheyenne stage and left beside the trail . At Cheyenne the guard discovered there was a reward on the dead man 's head , a thousand dollars , some said two , as one of the holdups who killed the driver of the currency coach outside of Deadwood in March . The guard rode back , located the body under a plum thicket by following the buzzards and the August flies , cut off the head , and carried it in a skin sack to Cheyenne but the reward had been withdrawn . There was much joking about this along the rival Sidney trail . It was a dirty trick and , besides , where did the Sidney crowd get off with their laughing ? So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses be stolen from under the nose of a whole show crowd , mostly gunbearing . Morissa wondered a little about Eddie and hoped he had gone back East to his family . Then one morning a man came riding for the doctor , not by the bridge , still toll-free to those seeking the doctor , but across the river far below and up through the breaks . When Morissa 's yard was empty he rode by and tossed a note over her fence . It was in a large , weak scrawl on wrapping paper : " Typhoid , come get me in wagon alone . Ecl . " There was a sketchy map , too , but Morissa did n't realize until later how much nearer he was to Sidney , the post hospital and the railroad home . The doctor was uneasy about Ed . Those pale-eyed , thin-skinned youths took the disease very hard this summer , with lingering intestinal ulceration , if they survived at all . She found him alone in a dugout in a deep box canyon that broke toward Lodgepole Creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps hidden there through t lie daylight hours . Eddie barely recognized her and although much too weak to sit up he was still too heavy to lift into the wagon . With a shovel she always carried she sank the hind wheels almost to the hub , made a ramp with the door from the dugout , and drew Eddie up into the wagon on a blanket . Then she drove home , coming in late at night , and with Charley 's help got him into bed , burning with fever , delirious , talking snatches of this and that , of a Jim and a Johnson , probably the dead Cut Lip , and of horses , but little that could be followed . They took turns keeping him in sheets wrung out in a tub of cold water and tried to feed him a little medication in scalded milk , a teaspoonful  | at a time , but for three weeks Morissa was afraid to ask about him every time she returned , and every time she was awakened by Ruth or Charley in the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one well enough to start home , the other hauled to the railroad in a box  --  one out of seven in her little hospital . The summer really had tapered off pretty thin for roadagents on the Cheyenne trail , with perhaps as little as thirteen dollars the holdups ' entire haul . Passengers were searched two or three times ; boots , coats , even the trousers of the men removed ; the women compelled to take down their hair . One stage was robbed twice within twelve miles , and clothing and bits of choice food taken from the passengers , perhaps for the girl in the robber shack , Morissa thought , and hoped . A troop of cavalry was assigned to special patrol and sometimes the soldiers rode the coaches . But the country was so vast , so broken , that it was safer to hold the gold back for the big bull trains or haul it on the Sidney trail . This was like a burr under the saddle blanket to Cheyenne , the newspapers demanding if there was no law in Wyoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In September Sam Bass and his gang got between sixty and seventyfive thousand dollars in a Union Pacific holdup , but they did this in Nebraska , east of Sidney , not very far from the hideout where Morissa found Eddie . She wondered if typhoid had kept him out of the holdup , still refusing to believe this , yet telling herself that a nod truly is as good as a wink to a blind mare . But the sheriff would n't be blind when he brought a charge of harboring criminals against her , nor would those who believed in hanging any companion of horse thieves when they came kicking her door down . There was talk that the Bass gang split up , with Sam going back to Texas , and the rest heading north toward Clarke 's bridge . Morissa found signs of a night camp at her dam in the little canyon , and an old piece of canvas half sunken in the mud of the shallow reservoir . She pulled it out , a heavy leather sack with a metal slide top and padlock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sent this down to Sidney but all she ever heard was that a sheriff from up in the Black Hills saw several of the Bass gang traveling the trail at night with a pack pony . They fled out upon the prairie and ran into some patrolling cavalry . There were seventeen thousand dollars of the Union Pacific loot in a pad under one of the saddles . Three nights before this a man had come to Morissa 's door to ask about Eddie Ellis . He slipped to the window so quietly that Blaze never awoke . Morissa let the man in , and with his hat tipped to shadow his  | face to the bearded cheekbones , he looked down upon the gaunt skeleton on the cot . Suddenly Eddie opened his eyes . " Hello , Jim ? " he said weakly , and then stopped when he saw that Morissa was there , too , holding the lamp above her head . The man left quickly . At the door he whispered , " He 's a goner , " and put a roll of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried right . " Afterward she went in to look down on Eddie . " If I dared move you I 'd send you straight to Sidney . I do n't like harboring outlaws ? " But there was still slyness in the sunken yellowed eyes . " You got no proof , " he said , low and weak . " I  --  we made some friends up to Red Cloud , me and Jack ? " " Well , plainly you did , " Morissa replied firmly and drew her hand from his clutching grasp . " I trust my brother is not involved with such men . " In late August , summer complaint had struck Etty 's children and those on the trail clear in to Deadwood . Some were brought down by the hundreds of disappointed miners leaving before the winter . A party of Slavonians stopped their wagon at Morissa 's place and one of the ragged , bearded men carried a small child in his arms to her , the body rigid and twisted , the eyes rolled up in convulsion . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pity , the men standing around with their callused hands hanging helplessly , tears slipping into the beard of the father . Morissa worked fast with a tepid bath in the foot tub , enemas , and a very light dose of sirup of rhubarb root , until the child finally relaxed but lay with her face still as death in its shower of pale curls . Later she accepted a little scalded milk and although the convulsions returned , they were shorter , less violent , and in a few days the small girl was sitting up , her frailness a hurt in Morissa 's breast . If only she could keep the child , feed her milk and eggs , set her in the window , with the sun golden on the pale hair , watch her grow strong and rosy and boisterous . Then one day the father brought a gold nugget to lay in the doctor 's palm . Morissa looked down at the man 's feet in burlap sacking and wire , the thin knees out , and she returned the twisted little cherry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried away to begin a pounding at the wagon . Toward evening he came again and held out something shining  --  a new-wrought ring of soft , raw gold , worked in a skillful pattern , a stylized herald 's staff and the twisted double serpents of the healer . Morissa looked into the father 's face and as she met his deep-socketed eyes such a sweetness of gratitude and pride rose in them that she felt ashamed and small . So she slipped the ring to her finger and watched the ragged miner go with the lovely child in his arms .  | Late that evening a man rode up from one of the saloons at the bridge . Doc was needed right away ; a woman there had the screeches or fits , he could n't rightly say which . Morissa found that it was Calamity Jane and screeching all right . Many of the whackers had dropped out with typhoid , or the fever to hunt gold farther north , toward the Yellowstone . Because Calamity claimed she had driven bulls and could certainly manage a deuce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the bedrolls to sleep it off . Sober , she had looked mighty sick , foulmouthed and complaining , but she could walk beside the bulls and cuss the horns off the mossiest of the outfit . Then here some fool tenderfeet tried to see how much whisky the lady wild cat of Deadwood Gulch could hold . Seems that four bits worth of Etty 's snakehead whisky about did it . Morissa got Jane quieted and over to the sodhouse . But Ruth banged her door at the sight of so dissolute a woman , and the doctor had to put the coffee on herself . Toward morning Morissa got her patient out of the ragged , stinking old rawhide suit , scrubbed and into a nightgown with embroidery at the throat and wrists , perhaps the first nightgown Calamity had worn in years . Morissa was unwilling to put her into the hospital room with the serious patients . Protecting their sleep against the tremens and the loud mouth of the woman , she told herself . But Jane got to Eddie next day , talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed kept shushing the woman , pretending later that it was because of the other patients . In two days Morissa had Jane 's hair soft and fluffy from an egg shampoo and got her into one of her dressing gowns , a rose-sprigged mull from the trousseau trunk . It was a little long for this other girl from Missouri , but it restored a hint of her winsome childhood as she came to sit in Morissa 's window for a cup of tea , holding up the trailing skirts , suddenly playing the lady . Yes , she felt much stronger , strong enough to roar for a drink , it seemed . Morissa poured her a little brandy and then tried to visit with her about the Canary family and discover what might be done for their Martha Jane . But already she was Calamity again , slyly drawing the bottle into the folds of her skirts . Morissa let her , and pretended not to see as she thinned out her tea with the brandy , but listened politely to her howl of laughter at their reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Issy , settin ' there big as a jaybird on a rail , callin ' yourself doc an ' all , " she repeated several times over Morissa 's protests that the framed diploma was genuine . " Remember when you was bein ' passed ' round to do the dirty work , a poor-farm kid with no pa ? Now you 're in cahoots with them big horse thieves plain fer everybody to see , an ' a ridin ' pretty as a picture book behint them spankin ' bays . Who 'd expect it of such a hombly little bastard ! "  | Morissa gripped her fingers on the teacup , surprised that the handle did n't crumple like a curl of white meringue . But soon Jane slipped into her crying jag and so the young doctor gave her a golden double eagle to warm her palm , brought out the rawhide suit , washed and neat , and took her out to a bull train heading back toward Deadwood right away . When Morissa got back to the house Ruth was cooking dinner , the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night Calamity entered the place . " I do n't aim to consort with her kind , " the woman said , tight-lipped , the thin cheekbones surprisingly pinkened . Charley tilted his chair back and laughed and did n't remind Ruth that one of the typhoid patients she packed and carried for night and day was from Madame Trogger 's place down near Sidney . New patients could n't keep Morissa 's mind from some of the things Calamity Jane had said , not even when Gwinnie came down with typhoid too . He asked for nothing , just lay like an emaciated young saint , his blue eyes burning in the skull holes of his face . But Eddie on the cot beside him was never quiet and kept Morissa reminded of his probable tie-up with outlaws . Certainly it was Eddie Ellis that Calamity had meant . " If you run with horse thieves you 'll be strung up for one ? " Morissa had warned her brother Jack several times last spring . Now she decided that as soon as Ed was strong enough for the journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the responsibility of his people , wealthy Ohioans , as she had discovered . But when she read the youth a paragraph from his father , he cried like a hysterical child . " You had no business ? " he repeated over and over . " A doctor must get in touch with a patient 's relatives ? " " When he 's dying ! " he finished for her . " Well , I rather die here with you . I hate my father and now he 's got my mother sidin ' with him , too , saying she wants me to come home , go to college , be a credit to him . " " His letter sounds very kind and reasonable . " " I 'll kill myself first ? " Eddie sobbed , and weak yellowish tears ran unnoticed from the corner of his eyes into the pillow . So Morissa soothed him and put the idea aside for a while . He was still too weak for the trip . When the time came to write to the father she would tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranch kept the settlers out of looking for government corners , he was met by coldeyed , gun-fondling men who seemed to be cowboys , but were softhanded  | and with free time to see everything , like the Bosler pistoleer who came to buy Morissa out . Even so the homeseekers pushed in closer . Several cowboys who knew the country and were handy with hardware themselves homesteaded south of the Wild Cat range on little valleys too small and too remote in the mountainous hills from the adjoining ranches . But after the settler was found shot in the back below Sidney , even these men were a little uneasy and Morissa with them , for herself and for next spring 's homeseekers who would surely be pushing into the valley of Coad and Bosler . They would not only be dragging trouble at their stubborn heels but finding it there , waiting . A series of fires running through the dry prairie followed the settler killing  --  homesteaders , grangers , burning out the winter range , the cattlemen complained . All one windy week the south horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north ranches , even the newer ones up toward the Niobrara and the Snake Creek flats , answered the distress signal of the range country . But with all the region fighting , the flames left whole townships black as shadowed velvet , and at one ranch four horses lay charred in the ashes of a log stable . They were blooded stock and if the man who set the fire was caught he would decorate a cottonwood till the buzzards picked his eyes out . True , the same thing had been promised for the thieves who stole the race horses at the Walker show but the horse thieves were mighty small-bore trouble compared to the settlers who would wreck the whole free-range business . There was an increase of angry talk against the grangers around the saloons and the livery stables , and at the whisky ranches along the trail . Several new men known to be fast on the draw showed up at the North Platte ranches , all riding horses conspicuously branded , but never headed toward the hard work of the cattle . Morissa remembered Tris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the professional gunmen would sit sassy as rattlesnakes on the doorstep and everybody had to walk around them . Evidently many were ready to walk around these hired range protectors just as meekly if they kept the settlers away . Tris was back from Omaha and had been up to the Dr. Kirk Sanitarium , as Morissa 's new sign in the window now announced  --  an absurd , squat little sod sanitarium standing alone , without city or settlement beyond the few houses of the bridge , and in unorganized territory , a sanitarium in the wilderness . The tall rancher was quiet the first time he saw the sign with the little vigil lights behind it , setting it off in the black darkness like a string of swamp lights . " What would you say to a practice in Omaha again ? " he asked the next Sunday as they rode up the river toward Ted Sailor 's British ranch .  | " You are n't going to quit running cattle ? " Morissa asked , dropping into the ranch expression in her concern . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ? " he stopped , and busied himself switching the black mane of his horse all one way and then back . " The meat-packing business that 's opening up in Omaha will make money for the first comers ? " It seemed somehow very serious , this that he was trying to say and yet did not . Morissa remembered his Auntie Mae and her twin daughters who needed money to make the good marriages that were fitting . Besides , the haze of smoke left by the burning prairie , perhaps set by homesteaders like herself , was still blue against Chimney Rock and Scotts Bluff ahead of them , with antelope and even rabbits thick , perhaps from the burned-over region . There was silence between them until they saw two of the Britishers from Sailor 's chasing a gray wolf and just about to rope him as they all vanished over a hill . " That wolf 's slow and his tail 's dragging , probably mangy , " Tris said , " or sick or burned . " " Could be mangy all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here , " Morissa answered , and was angry at her literalness . There was a fine ranch supper at Sailor 's : grouse , but unhung and Western-fresh , so any doctor could bear to eat it ; venison , too , with Sailor 's ale , the product that had built the family fortune in England . Tris and Morissa planned to ride back through the early moonlight but somehow the time passed , first over the hunting stories when the young men brought in their itchy wolf , and then the discussion Morissa started by saying they should burn or bury the wolf right away and bake all their clothing and rope , take scrub baths and a good anointing , with a stinking itch ointment she would be happy to prescribe . Later a couple of breed fiddlers played for the stomp of boots , although there were only four women for around twenty-five men , including about everybody of the ranch except the bronch-crippled choreman . ' When they were ready to start back through the clouding night , a couple of shots down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much steam to let off . But there was a yelling that sounded like the choreman , and so everybody pushed out the door together , like cows coming out of a corral . Scattering for leg room , they ran down the slope , Morissa and Tris too , everybody very long in the light of Ted Sailor 's lantern as he came puffing along behind . There were three , four more shots , fast , spitting bright red in the darkness , and then the running of a horse . When they reached the pole corrals everything was still , but as the light of the lantern swung  | around through the open gate , it fell on a man down in the dry horse dust . It was Sailor 's new gun hand , Pete Shrone . Nobody else seemed around but after a while the choreman came sidling out of a stable , still cautious . " Man come ridin ' in a little piece ago , askin ' for Pete , " the crippled old cowboy managed to say . " So I fetches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seein 's he do n't have much truck with the bunkhouse ? " " Yeh , Pete 's kind do n't , " someone volunteered readily enough , now that the gunman was dying . So Tris and Morissa had to stay . After the man was dead the doctor cut out a bullet that had come up diagonally through his side and almost out the opposite shoulder  --  a mushroomed bullet that was a gray lump just under the skin . The man had spoken no word , although he was conscious to the end . But the choreman was happy with his circle of dark , attentive faces and repeated all he knew over and over . " ' Damn your hide , Joe Barker ! ' the stranger yells when he finds Pete a settin ' there on them corral poles . I been follyin ' you a thousan ' miles , now go fer yer gun ! ' Then there 's two quick shots runnin ' together , and the newcomer 's down in the dirt . Pete ambles over to ' im , laughin ' that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead . But there 's three shots from the ground , fast , and Pete drops , his gun blastin ' off into the air . Then the man tears out fer his horse and quits the country . " " So Ladyfinger Pete got his ? " the cowboys told each other , laughing a little out of the contempt and envy that the working hands had for the high-priced pistoleers . Tris was even quieter on the slow ride home through the clouding dawn and Morissa too . At the house Eddie was crying into his pillow because the doctor had been gone so long . Gwinnie had tried to help Ruth quiet him , make him feel that he was n't deserted . Morissa found herself impatient with the sick youth as a mother might be impatient , and as contrite and loving , too , it seemed . But before sleeping she wrote his father a little more urgently . " I really think your son Edward Ellis should be removed to a hospital where he can receive the very best treatment and care . His condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet instead of relief Morissa felt a loss , a sad and empty loss , as though her patient were already gone . Something like the loss she felt when Tom Reeder left , only this went deeper , deep as a scalpel 's blade . Many times in her months here at the bridge , Morissa was out when Tris came , or had to leave , and slowly she admitted to herself what she had often said lightly to him  --  that the wife of Tris Polk should not be a doctor . Yet he had always waited , sometimes many hours , and when she put on the gold-shot reseda or the brocade of blush pink , lovely as  | the prairie roses of August in the evening sun , no trace of annoyance seemed to remain . Finally the Sunday after the Sailor visit he spoke of the new ranch house that was to be ready for them when they came back from Texas and Illinois . " ? Unless you prefer your home in Sidney , or in Omaha . " " Oh , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still trying to make it light , protecting herself , not clear just from whom , but when Tris kissed her she knew he took it as acceptance . She knew , too , that now she had dared to mean it , and was just a little saddened by what seemed a curious sort of desertion of Allston Hoyt and the memory of him . Almost like a daughter going away . The next week the stage brought up a great box of roses that Tris had sent from Omaha , with a June calendar sheet enclosed and a ribboned bit of pencil that Lorette 's young daughters would receive with joy . Morissa put one of the roses into the hair of the woman from Madame Trogger 's and held the armful up high for Gwinnie and the others to see , their sick eyes momentarily alight with pleasure at the flowers and the flushed face of their doctor . But when Morissa looked over to Eddie he had turned towards the plastered wall , his thin shoulder racked with his crying , so she went for a bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could sit up as well as anyone by now . At first Morissa found herself resisting the June plans perhaps because of that other spring date set two years ago with Allston and all the humiliation and unhappiness that grew out of it . But Tris was a man of different caliber . He knew Robin was her stepfather and that Morissa had been put out on a poor-farm and surely all that Calamity Jane could tell . For it turned out that Calamity had n't stayed with the bull train after Morissa sobered her up but wandered back to hang around Clarke 's and Etty 's , until she was howling again , shouting out her damning words against their lady doc who would throw a sick woman into a bull wagon to get rid of her . Morissa Kirk was nothing but a woods colt , a dirty bastard . Finally Clarke 's man had her loaded on his train , to ride the bedrolls out of there , cold drunk . Nothing of this was mentioned directly to Morissa , except that Tris seemed even more openly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cheeks to glowing . So she circled the twentysixth of June for him . " Wednesday is the best day of all , " her mother once said sentimentally , and wistfully . And , " Married in the month of roses , June , life will be like one long honeymoon . " So Morissa wrote her dressmaker for fashion plates of wedding attire , perhaps a silk suit this time , more fitting than a white dress here in the valley . Besides , a woman should have only one white wedding dress and hers was already in the bottom of a trunk , folded away carefully in blue  | tissue paper to prevent the satin 's yellowing , although why she took these precautions she could not have told . There must be two or three cool and pretty afternoon dresses , too , for Texas , and something a little more elaborate for evening , selected to show off her brown skin . No , better two evening gowns , one yellow because Tris preferred that and one in the fashionable and delicate new shade called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote a letter to Dr. Aiken about her work here and her plans , asking him to recommend a substitute for the summer , perhaps permanently . Then there was a letter to Robin and Jackie , too , and finally one for Tris 's Auntie Mae . " I am a happy betrothe ? " THE YEAR TURNING TOWARD FALL WAS THE FINEST MORISSA HAD ever seen , sweet and golden , fragrant as her muskmelons ripening in the sun . But she could n't live in this mood long . On the way back from typhoid vigils up north , she rode home beside a detachment of troops that Etty had guided in a three weeks ' scout around the Black Hills . More Indian trouble , Lieutenant Larman said , and told her about the Indian uprisings all over the West , particularly up north again . " ? Now the troops they chase the Nez Perce , the people who grow the fine Appaloosa horse , " the usually silent Etty said . " But today they go hungry and run on foot ; run over rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that was why long lines of troops had been marching over Clarke 's bridge this summer again , hurrying to Red Cloud , many to go on north against the Nez Perce , already being pursued with Gatling guns and howitzer . Meanwhile , although gold dust poured into the Sidney bank , discouraged placer miners had been scattering north to prospect the Little Missouri country and were attacked by a few Sioux still off the reservation . One man was shot and all the horses taken , the miners forced to make the hundred miles back afoot . Deadwood raised the bounty on Indian scalps to a hundred and fifty dollars each , and when freighting slacked off , some of the bullwhackers that Morissa knew went Indian hunting with the rest . And now , with more troops drawn away from around Red Cloud Agency it seemed Crazy Horse was ready to hit the warpath again from there , only one good ride from the bridge .  | " Do you believe it this time ? " Morissa asked the young lieutenant , recalling all the scares of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he replied , less certain about such things now than his first year out of West Point . But that night a courier galloped out of the darkness warning all the trail and the bridge to prepare for a siege , a Sioux uprising . Morissa replied to his call and went back to bed , but several bluecoats came to take her to the darkened blockhouse . " And what 's to become of my bed patients , five with typhoid , two smallpox ? " she asked . So the troopers went back without her . Because Charley was off at Sidney , Ruth brought Blaze into the hospital room , away from the silencing knife , the arrow and tomahawk . For the first time she consented to put her hand to the steel of a gun as Morissa showed her how to fire the Colt , the Peacemaker , the doctor very patient , remembering her own horror of its dark weight only a little over a year ago . While they were seated at the kitchen table , the gun between them , there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overfed Blaze dog . Morissa looked into the frightened eyes of Ruth Adams . With a swift motion of her hand the doctor pushed the gun to Ruth and sent her into the darkened hospital room . Then , with her rifle across her arm , she swung the shielded wall lamp around so the light fell upon the door , leaving her in duskiness and called , " Come in ! " A man stood in the opening doorway , a white man , young . " I came to see how Eddie Ellis is getting along ? " he said apologetically . " Well , you picked a good time , in the middle of an Indian scare ! " Afterward Morissa discovered it was Doug Goodale , said to be an outlaw too but he visited pleasantly with them that night , sitting at ease like a man well accustomed to the parlor and the drawing room . When he left he thanked the doctor . " A very pleasant evening , Miss Morissa , " he said , tipping his Western hat as though on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker , " Eddie said proudly , and Morissa was pleased in his pride . That and the two girls from Sidney who had come last week to see Ed seemed good omens ; perhaps this patient would yet learn to be something but a hospital infant , would become a well man . It was true that the girls had seemed a bit more interested in the bridge settlement , particularly the saloons and dance halls , and even in Gwinnie . But they were well-spoken and had evidently met Eddie at a church social . But young Goodale 's visit helped ease the night and soon after dawn Charley was back . He had heard of the Indian alarm and drove his load straight through to get in , very uneasy after he heard the death keening of Etty 's wife as he passed there . Morissa knew of no one dying , but when the sun came out hot on a
