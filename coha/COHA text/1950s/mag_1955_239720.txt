Why &; How There Can Be More IN the high-flying air world , one fledgling that has yet to find its wings is the air-freight business . Of 120 new lines that hopefully started up at the end of World War II , more than 50% went bust . Last year U.S. air freighters flew only 284 million ton-miles of cargo , a 3% gain over 1953 , but barely one-tenth of 1% of the total cargo business . <P> In theory , air cargo is tailor-made for the U.S. economy . It permits companies to transport goods faster , thus cut down on expensive inventories and release valuable working capital for other uses . Warehousing and packaging costs can be cut ; pilferage and damage are less of a problem , cutting insurance costs . By flying , a St. Louis shoe manufacturer has reduced inventories 50% for its store chain across the U.S. , finds that savings are 3 times the increased transportation costs . But most companies use air freight only for emergency orders or occasional shipments of highly perishable or specialized items ( from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor . <P> The high price of air transport makes it uneconomical for many companies to ship by plane . Current average rates are 20 a ton-mile , v. 1.4 a ton-mile for railroads , about 6 for trucks . The airlines can not reduce the rates because their own costs are so high . American Airlines , Pan American and T.W.A. are all expanding air-cargo services ; United Airlines jumped its business from 4,500,000 ton-miles in 1946 to 34 million , showed a 23% gain last year alone . Yet so far , not one company has reported a sizable profit from its cargo fleets . <P> The high cost is due partly to the fact that ground handling of cargo is done with expensive , old-fashioned methods . According to a University of Tennessee survey , " an estimated 80% of total in-transit time for air freight is consumed by slow and inefficient ground handling . " Only a small number of the major U.S. airports have separate air-freight terminals ; most lines process their freight through passenger terminals or makeshift sheds . Furthermore , most cargo planes flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to load and unload , often have high maintenance costs .
