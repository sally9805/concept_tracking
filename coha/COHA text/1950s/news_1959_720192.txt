txt A complete forgiveness of state taxes due April 15 on 1958 incomes was reported to have been proposed seriously today at a top-level Republican conference with Governor Rockefeller . A decision on whether to accept the proposal as part of the plan for withholding of taxes Was deferred to give those present time to consider its implications and Changes in the state 's fiscal practices it would involve . Another meeting of the same group is scheduled for tomorrow to discuss the subject again . One of the main arguments in favor of the change is that it would make the tax increases Mr. Rockefeller is preparing to propose politically acceptable . The forgiveness is said to have been described at the conference as a " selling gimmick . " Tax to be Deducted A complete forgiveness of the tax on 1958 incomes would mean that the great bulk of the taxpayers would not have to file any returns on April 15 or make any installment payInentS at that time . Instead ; employers would start deducting the state income tax from wages and salaries received after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax . For the first year withholdings would be at a higher rate than in subsequent years . The higher starting rate would enable the state to get in withholdings as much in nine months as it would thereafter get in twelve . In this way it would collect on wages and salaries received from Jan. 1 to April 1 when the withholding system will not be in effect . Residents and non-residents would be treated alike under this plan . Ordinarily those who work in New York but live in New Jersey or Connecticut have their New York State taxes withheld by their employers . This withholding takes place on March 1 . Withholding Delayed A recent order of the State Tax Commission , expecting changes in the law , postponed the withholding of taxes due from non-residents until March 15 . By that date it should be clear whether the Legislature will approve any changes in the law . Income that is not subject to withholding , such as fees received by lawyers and physicians , interest and dividends , and business profits would receive special treatment . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such income would escape taxation on their receipts dur- ing the first calendar quarter. , The Federal witholding tax ! law went into effect in 1943 . At ' " that time a forgiveness provisinn canceled three-quarters ofi one year 's tax . Eleven states , now use the witholding tax sys-i tern . While the conference was ini session . Richard C. Amper , Mr. Rockefeller 's press secretary . announced formally that the Governor would - deliver his Budget Message , containing his tax recommendations , in person to an unusual joint session of the Legislature at 12:30 P. M. next Monday . Ordinarily , Governors do not deliver their budget proposals in person . Mr. Amper also announced that Mr. Rockefeller had arranged a special state-wide television program for next Monday evening to explain his tax and budget ' programs to the people . This program will originate from station WRCATV , Channel 4 , in New York City . It will be carried live on a state-wide network from 6:15 to 6:30 P : M. Presumably the Governor will drive to New York from Albany for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the participants in today 's meeting would discuss the proposal afterward . As one explained : " We were sworn to secrecy . " But the matter was canvassed informally with several key members of the Legislature who were not present . Those at the conference inchided Governor Rockefeller . Lieut . Gov . Malcolm Wilson , T. Norman Hurd . budget director : Louis J. Lefkowitz , Attorney General : Frank Jamieson , a Rockefeller adviser ; L. Judson Morhouse , Republican State Chairman , and the legislative leaders . Legislators at the session were Walter J. Mahoney , Senate majority leader : Oswald D. Heck , Assembly Speaker ; Senator Austin W. Erwin , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee ; Joseph F. Carlino . Assembly minority leader , and Assemblyman William H. Mackenzie . chairman of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee . According to the version of the proposal that was circulating through the Capitol tonight , the forgiveness would be contingent on placing the state on a withholding basis for the income tax by April 1 . In making the shift to a withholding basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , similar to the Federal system . In addition there would be changes in braCkets and in rates . These would all be designed to raise the yield of the personal income tax by at least $100,000,000 for a full twelve month period . Its total yield , under existing rates , has been , estimated at $571,500,000 . This includes that portion of the income tax now paid into the war bonus and mental health bond accounts as well as the amount paid into the General Fund . For bookkeeping purposes , ' the shift to a withholding basis ' coupled with the forgiveness of the tax on 1.958 incomes , might require a change in the state 's fiscal year . This now starts April 1 and runs to March 31 . It could be changed by statute to start July 1 and run to June 30 , as the Federal Government 's does . The state fiscal year ran from July 1 to June 30 for many years . It was changed early in former Gov , Thomas E. Dewey 's first Administration to April 1 to March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . This change permitted payment of state taxes in quarterly installments . Previously half the amount due had to be paid when the return was filed . Presumably Mr .. Rockefeller is departing from precedent and undertaking his television explanation because his budget will be the first in the state 's history to pass the $2,000,000 , - 000 mark and because he is asking for larger increases in taxes than any previous Gov , governor . The purpose of the television explanation is to head off opposition to the tax rises Mr. Rockefeller will recommend . MiChael H. Prendergast , the Democratic State chairman , declared in a broadcast interview here tonight that there would have been no increase in income taxes had former Gov . Averell Harriman been returned to office . Mr. Harriman , a Democrat , lost to Mr. Rockefelter , a Republican , by more than 557,000 votes last November . . The former Governor had been contemplating an increase in the gasoline tax had he been re-elected , Mr. Prendergast said . The Democratic chairman was not sure , however , that this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a gallon on Diesel fuel . It might ; have been only 1 cent and 11/2 cents , he said .
