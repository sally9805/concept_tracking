Had her son been an ordinary twelve-year-old boy at an ordinary sort of school , Mrs. Walter Thomas of Milstead , Ga . might not have found his letter so shocking . But little Louis is partially blind , and the school he goes to is the Academy for the Blind at Macon . Last week Louis ' letter was causing quite a scandal in Georgia . " Mama , " he had written , " they 're beating us down here . Come and get me . " <P> In Atlanta , the state board of education summoned the academy 's Superintendent F. G. Nelms and Principal Robert Long to a hearing . Louis and his mother charged that Principal Long had given Louis two severe beatings , but Long insisted that they were only " spankings . " Gradually the board began to learn that Nelms and Long had some strange notions about just what a spanking is . <P> Superintendent Nelms conceded that Louis was " not a bad boy . " But he indicated that he saw nothing wrong with using a strap , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I spank my own children , " said he , " and I 'm somewhat ashamed the next morning when the buttocks turn blue . " Cried Board Chairman George Whitman Jr. : " The state of Georgia has a law abolishing corporal punishment in prisons and on chain gangs . Do you think that this law , applying to hardened criminals , should apply to a partially blind twelve-year-old boy ? " Answered Nelms : " The board has never ordered me to abolish corporal punishment . " <P> Principal Long was in complete agreement with Superintendent Nelms . Louis , it seemed , had violated school rules by " scuffling " with another boy , and so Principal Long " did what I think most people would do . " He whipped off his own belt and gave Louis a lashing . Then , a few days later , another student reported that Louis had hit him with a football . This time Long used a paddle . He held Louis down on a table , hit him " 14 or 15 times . " When Louis tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he would get a finger broken . <P> As a result of the testimony , State School Superintendent M. Dv Collins ordered an investigation of the whole academy . But Board Chairman Whitman was still troubled ; at the hearing neither Long nor Nelms had seemed to understand what all the fuss was about . Even after several days , Louis ' backside was still a mass of welts and bruises . " Do you call that a spanking or a beating ? " Chairman Whitman had asked . Answered Superintendent Nelms : " A spanking. "
