The Two Brothers A Story by V. S. Pritchett Drawings by Arthur Shilstone T HE two brothers went to Ballady to look at the house . It was ruinous but cheap , there were miles of bog and mountain alive with birds , there was the sea and not a soul living within two miles of it . As had always happened in their childhood and as had repeatedly happened since the war when " the Yank " had returned to the Old Country to look after his sick brother , " the Yank , " with his voracious health , had his way . " Sure it 's ideal , " yelled the Yank . The time was the spring . " We 'll take it for six months , " he exclaimed . " And after that ? " asked Charlie , watching him like a woman for plans and motives he had not got . " Och , we 'll see . We 'll see . Sure what 's the use of worrying about the future ? " said the Yank . He knew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching them like an eagle on a rock , waiting to shadow them with its wing . In six months he would be left alone . He knew how the Yank , his brother , dealt with time . Out came his gun and he took a pot shot at it , went after it , destroyed it , and then laughed at his own skill and forgot . In the sky and land at Ballady there was the rugged wildness of farewell . This was the end of the land , prostrating itself in rags before the Atlantic . The wind stripped the soil so that there was no full-grown tree upon it , androcks stood out like gravestones in the bigoted little fields . A few black cattle grazed , a few fields of oats were grown , the rest was mountain and the wide empty pans of bog broken into eyes of water . The house lay in a hollow out of sight of the sea , which was only half a mile away . It was a grey , rambling place of two stories with outhouses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaky , and neglected and barely furnished . There were fuchsia bushes growing right up to the windows , beating against them and blinding them in the gales , pressed close as people in the night . The garden was feet deep in grasses , the gravel drive had become two grass ruts , and for a gate there was an iron hurdle propped against a gap in the stone wall . From the hill above Ballady Charlie and Micky had made out its slate roof silvery in the light , the ribs of the roofless stable , like a shining skeleton . " The way it is , " the Yank explained when he went in to Ballady alone for a drink now and then . " The poor bloody brother he 's after having a breakdown . " The Yank was a wild , tall , lean , muscular fellow , straight and springy as a whip , with eyes like dark pools , with bald brows , lips loose and thin , and large ears protruding from his bony skull . His black hair stood up straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skin could be seen through it ; his nose was straight and his face was reddened by the wind . He went about with a cigarette in the corner of lips askew in a conquering grin , and carried a gun all day . A breezy , sporting chap . He wandered up and down the hog and the fields or lay in the dunes waiting ; then , bang went his gun , the sea-birds screamed over the sand , and up he got from his knees to pick up a rabbit or a bird . The sun burned him , the wind cut him , the squalls pitted him like shot . He had no secrets from anyone . Fifteen years of Canada , he told them , four years of war , and now for a good time while his money lasted . Then , he said publicly to all , he would go back . All he wanted now was a bit of rough country , a couple of drinks , and a gun ; and he had got them . It was what he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . How different Charlie was , slight and wiry , nervous and private as a silvery fish . His hair was fair , almost white , and his eyes were a keen dark blue in the pupils and a fairer blue was ringed round them . His features were sharp and he kept his lips together and his head down as he walked , glancing nervously about him . He looked like a man walking in his thoughts . If , when he returned from the sea , he saw someone in his path , he dodged away and made a long detour back to the house . If taken by surprise and obliged to talk to a stranger , he edged away murmuring something . His voice was quiet , his look shrill , pleading , and shy . He was absorbed in the most private of all pieties , the piety of fear to which his imagination devoted a rich and vivid ritual . He did not badger his brother with speech . He followed him about the house , standing near him , asking with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage , company , and protection . He asked no more than his physical presence and to watch . In the mornings at first , after they had established themselves in the house , there was always this situation : Micky restless , burning to be out with his gun , and Charlie 's eyes silently asking him not to go . Micky bursting to be free , Charlie worrying to hold him . Sometimes Micky would be melted by an unguarded glance at his brother . For a moment he would forget his own strength and find himself moved by an awed tenderness for this clever man who had passed examinations , stayed in the Old Country , worked his way up in a bank , and then , when the guns had started to popple , and " the troubles " began , had collapsed . Micky was kind and humored him . They would sit for hours together in the house , with the spring growing in the world outside , while Charlie cajoled him with memories of their boyhood together , or listened to Micky 's na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours Charlie forgot the awful years , or he would have the illusion of forgetting . For the two surrounded themselves with walls of talk , and Charlie , crouching round the little campfire of his heart , used every means to keep the talk going , to preserve this picture of life standing as still as a dreamy ship in haven and himself again a child . But soon the sun would strike through the window and the fairness of the sky would make Micky restless . He would lead his brother , by a pretext , into the garden and slyly get him to work there , planting lettuces or digging , and when he had got him to work he would slip away , pick up his gun , and be off to the dunes . S HORTLY after moving into the house Micky went into Dill , got drunk as was his habit , and returned with a dog , a young black retriever , very strong , affectionate , and lively . He did not know why he had bought it and could hardly remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home he said on the impulse to Charlie : " Here , Charlie boy . I 've bought you a dog . One of the priest 's pups . " Charlie smiled slightly and looked in wonder . " There y'are , man , " Micky cried . " Your dog . " " Hup ! Go to your master , " said Micky , giving the dog a push and sent it over to Charlie , who still incredulously gazed . " Note that 's kind of you , " he murmured , flushing slightly . He was speechless with pleasure . Micky , who had given the animal to his brother on the spur of the moment , was now delighted with himself , sunned in his generosity . " Sure now ye 've got yer dog , " Micky kept saying , " ye 'll be all right . Ye 'll be all right now ye 've got the dog . " Charlie gazed at Micky and the animal , and slyly he smiled to himself ; Micky had done this because he had a had conscience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to the retriever , Micky going out and shooting rabbits for it , and Charlie cooking them and taking out the bones . But when Micky got up and took his gun and the retriever jumped up to go out with him , Charlie would whistle the dog back and say : " Here ! Stay here . Lie down . Ye 're going out with me in a minute . " It was his dog . At last Charlie went out and the watchful creature leaped out with him . Charlie drew courage from it as it loped along before him , sniffing at walls and standing stiff with ears cocked to see the sudden rise of a bird . Charlie talked to it in a low running murmur hardly made of words but easing to the mind . When it stopped he would pass his clever hands over its velvety nose and glossy head , feeling the strange life ripple under the hair and obtaining a curious strength from the tumult . Then he would press on and whistle the creature after him and make across the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sea ; but as the retriever ran it paused often , as Charlie began to note with bewilderment and then with dread , to listen for Micky 's voice or the sound of his gun . When he saw this Charlie redoubled his efforts to win the whole allegiance of the dog . Power was renewing itself in him . And so he taught the dog a trick . He called it over the rocks , slipping and yelping to the sea 's edge . Here the sand was white . and as the worlds of clouds bowled over the sky to the mountains where the light brimmed like golden bees , the sea would change into deep jade halls , purple where the weeds lay and royal blue under the sparkling sun , and the air was sinewy and strong . Charlie took off his clothes and , shivering at the sight of his own thin pale body , his loose queasy stomach and the fair sickly hairs now picking up gold from the light , and with a desire to cleanse himself of sickness and fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with beating heart called to the dog . It stood up whining and barking for a while , running up and down the rock , and at last plunged in pursuit . Then the man caught hold of its tail and let himself be towed out to sea , and for minutes they would travel out and out until , at a word , the dog returned , snorting , heart pumping , shoulders working and eyes gazing upwards and the green water swilling off its back until it had pulled Charlie back into his depth . Then Charlie would sit drying himself and listening to the scream of the birds while the black retriever yelped and shivered at his side . And if Micky were late for his meal when he returned , through drinking with the schoolmaster or going away for a day to the races , Charlie would say nothing . He would build up a big turf fire in the empty room and wait with the dog at his side , murmuring to it . But it took Charlie hours to make up his mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irregular . There were days when the absences of his brother left him alone with his fears , and on these days he would helplessly see the dog run after Micky and go off with him . Soon it would hardly obey Charlie 's call . " You 're taking the dog from me , " Charlie complained . " Sure if ye 'd go out the dog 'd follow you , " said Micky . " Dammit , what 's the use of staying inside ? I do n't want the dog , but the poor bloody creature needs a run a n't follows me . It 's only natural . " " Natural . That 's it , " Charlie reflected . From him that hath not shall be taken even that which he hath . But he cried out sharply : " Sure you have it trained away from me . " Then they quarrelled , and Micky , thinking his head was getting too hot for his tongue , went out to the dunes and stood in the wind staring at the sea . Why was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since the end of the war he had looked after Charlie , getting him out of hospital and into a nursing home , then to houses in the country , sacrificing a lot of his own desire to have a good time before he returned to Canada , in order to get his brother back to health . Micky 's money would not last for ever ; soon he would have to go , and then what would happen ? But when he returned with cooler head , the problem carelessly thrown off , he was kind to his brother . They sat in eased silence before the fire , the dog dreaming at their feet , and to Charlie there returned the calm of the world . His jealousies , his suspicions , his reproaches , all the spies sent out by his reconnoitering fears , were called in and with Micky lie was at peace and no shadow of the future was on him . y ET as the months climbed higher out of July into August and swung there awhile , enchanted by their own halcyon weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be faced . Micky knew and Charlie knew , but each wished the other to speak . It was Micky who , without warning , became impatient and spoke out . " Lookut here , Charlie , - he said one evening as he washed blood off his hands in the kitchen  --  he had been skinning and cleaning a couple of rabbits ? " are you coming back to Canada with me in September ? " " To Canada is it ? " said the brother putting his thin fingers on the table and speaking in a gasping whisper . He stood incredulous . Yet he had expected this . " And leave me here alone ! " " Not at all , " said Micky . " I said , ' You 're coming with me . ' You heard me . Will ye come with me to Canada ? " Charlie drew in his lips and his eyes were restless with agony . " Sure , Micky , ye know I ca n't do that , " he said . " But what 's to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ye 've got your bit of pension and yell be as comfortable as in your own home . Get out of this damn country that 's what ye want . Sure ' t is no good at all except for old people and children , " cried Micky . But Charlie was looking out of the window towards the mountains . To go out into the world , to sit in trains with men , to sleep in houses with them , to stand bewildered , elbowed and shouldered by men in a new country ! Or , as the alternative , to stay alone without Micky , left to his memories . " You 'll not leave me , Micky boy ? " he stammered in panic . Micky was bewildered by the high febrile voice , the thin body shivering like a featherless bird . Then Charlie changed . He hunched his shoulders , narrowing himself and cowering round his heart , hardening himself against the world , and his eyes shot out suspicions , jealousies , reproaches , the weapons of a sharp mind . " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . Micky ridiculed the idea . " Ye knew as well as I did , dammit , when we took the place , that I 'd be going now , " he said . Yes , this was true , Charlie had known it . Micky took the matter to his friend the schoolmaster . He was a stout , hard-drinking old man with a shock of curly gray hair . His manner was theatrical and abrupt . " ' T is the poor bloody brother , " Micky said . " What am I to do with him at all ? " " Ye 've no more money , " said the schoolmaster . " Ye 've been with him for years , " he went on . He paused again . " Ye ca n't live on him . " " And he must live with you . " He glowered at Micky and then his fierce look died away . " Sure there 's nothing you can do . Nothing at all , " said the schoolmaster . Micky filled their glasses again . H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful bird scooping the light . The peasants stood in their long shadows in the fields and fishermen left their boats for the harvest . Micky was sad to be leaving this beautiful isolation . But he had to return to the question . He and Charlie began to argue it continually day and night . Sometimes Charlie was almost acquiescent , but at last always retired within himself . Since he could not sit in the safety of the old talk , his cleverness found what comfort it could for him in the new . Soon it was clear to Micky that Charlie encouraged the discussion , cunningly played with it , tortured him with vacillations , cunningly played on his conscience . But to Charlie it seemed that he was struggling to make his brother aware of him fully ; deep in the piety of his fear he saw in Micky a man who had never worshipped at its icy altars . He must be made to know . So the struggle wavered until one night it came out loudly into the open . " God Almighty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " IE you 'd been in France you 'd have had something to cry about . That 's what 's wrong with this bloody country . All a pack of damn cowards , and ye can see it in their faces when they stare at you like a lot of bleating sheep . " " Oh , is that it ? " said Charlie gripping the arms of his chair . " Is that what you 're thinking all these years ? Ye 're saying I 'm afraid , is it ? You 're saying I 'm a coward . Is that what you were thinking when you came home like a red lord out of hell in your uniform , pretending to be glad to see me and the home ? But thinking in your own heart I 'm a coward not to be in the British army . Oh , is that it ? " His voice was quiet , high , and monotonous in calculated contrast to Micky 's shouting anger . But his body shook . A wound had been opened . He was a coward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his clever mind quickly closed the wound . He was a man of peace . He desired to kill no one . He worshipped the great peace of God . This was why he had avoided factions , agreed with all sides , kept out of politics , and withdrawn closer and closer into himself . At times it had seemed to him that the only place left in the world for the peace of God was in his own small heart . And what had Micky done ? In the middle of the war he had come home , the Destroyer . In five minutes by a few reckless words in the drink shop and streets of the town he had ruined the equilibrium Charlie had tended for years and had at last attained . In five minutes Charlie had become committed . He was no longer " Mr. Lough the manager , " a man of peace . No , he was the brother of " that bloody pro-British Yank . " Men were boycotted for having brothers in the British army , they were threatened , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a green and white place in a postcard had become a place of windows hollow-eyed with evil vigils . Within a month he had received the first note threatening his life . " ' T was yourself , " said Charlie  --  discovering at last his enemy . " ' T was yourself , Micky , that brought all this upon me . Would I be sick and destroyed if you had n't come back ? " " Gripes , " said Micky , hearing the argument for the first time and pained by this madness in his brother . " Cripes , man , an ' what was the rest of ye up to ? Serving God Almighty like a lot of choir boys , shooting up some poor lonely policeman from a hedge and driving old women out of their homes . " " Stop it , " shouted Charlie , as the memories broke upon him and he put his fingers to his ears . Micky threw his cigarette into the fire and took his brother by the shoulder in compas-sion . He was sorry for having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , armoring himself . " So it 's a coward I am , is it ! " he said . " Well , I stayed when they threatened me and I 'll stay again . You 're thinking I 'm a coward . " He was resolute . But behind the shrubs brushing against the window , in the spaces between the cool September stars , were the fears . There was nothing else for it . Charlie watched Micky preparing to go , indifferent and resigned , feeding his courage on this new picture of his brother . He turned to it as to a secret revelation . Micky was no longer his brother . He was the Destroyer , the Prince of this World , the man of darkness . Micky , surprised that his good intentions were foiled , gave notice to the landlord , to force Charlie . Charlie renewed the agreement . He spoke little ; he took no notice of the dog , which had now completely deserted him . When Micky had gone it would be his . Charlie kicked it once or twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sea . He was staying here . He had all the years of his life to swim in the sea . Micky countered this by open neglect of his brother . He entered upon a life of wilder enjoyment . He gave every act the quality of a reckless farewell . He was out all day and half the night . In Ballady he drank the schoolmaster weeping under the table and came staggering home , roaring like an opera and was up at dawn , no worse for it , after the duck . " This is a rotten old wall , " Micky said in the garden one day , and started pushing the stones off the top of it . A sign it was his wall no longer . He chopped a chair up for firewood . He ceased to make his bed . He took a dozen empty whiskey bottles and , standing them at the end of the kitchen garden , used them as shooting targets . He shot three rabbits and threw two of them into the sea . He burned some old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a haversack to the fisherman and a second gun to the schoolmaster . A careless enjoyment of destruction seized him . Charlie watched it , saying nothing . The Destroyer . One evening as the yellow sun flared in the pools left by the tide on the sand , Micky came upon Charlie . " Not a damn thing , " Micky said , tapping his gun . But as they stood there , some gulls which had been flying over the rocks came inland and one fine fellow flew out and circled over their heads , its taut wings deep blue in the shadow as it swung round . Micky suddenly raised his gun and fired and , before the echoes had broken in the rocks , the wings collapsed and the bird dropped warm and dead . " God Almighty , man , " cried Charlie , turning away with nausea , " is nothing sacred to ye ? " " It 's no damned good , " grinned Micky , picking up the bird by the wing , which squeaked open like a fan . " Let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea . This was what he thought of wings . T HEN with a week to go , without thinking he struck a bad blow . He went off to Dill to say good-by to the boys , and the retriever followed him although Charlie called it back . The races were on at Dill , but Micky spent most of the time in the pubs telling everyone lie was going back to Canada . A man hearing this said he 'd change dogs with him . His dog , he said , was a spaniel . He had n't it with him but he 'd bring it down next fair . Micky was enthusiastic . " I know ye will , " said Micky . " Sure yell bring it . " " Ah , well now , " said the man . " I will bring it . " " ' T is a great country the west , " said Micky . " Will ye have another ? " " I will , " said the man , and as he drank : " In the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Micky returned the next day without the dog . " Where 's the dog ? " said Charlie suspiciously . " Och sure , " began Micky evasively , realizing for the first time what he had done . " D' you see the way it is , there is a man in Dill --  " " Ye 've sold it . Ye 've sold my dog , " Charlie shouted out , rushing at his brother . His shout was the more unnerving because he had spoken so little for days . Micky drew back . " Ah now , Charlie , be reasonable now . Sure you never did anything for the dog . You never took it out . You did n't care for it .. .. " Charlie gripped a chair and painfully sat down , laying his head in his hands on the table . " You brought the war on me , you smash me up , you take the only things I have and leave me stripped and alone , " he moaned . " Oh , God in heaven , " he half sobbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peace ! " Now the dog was gone , Charlie sat still . He would not move from the house , nor even from the sitting-room except to go to bed . He would scarcely speak . Sulking , Micky repeated to his uneasy conscience , sulking , sulking . He 's either mad or he 's sulking . What could he do ? They sat estranged , already far apart , impatient for the act of departure . When the eve of his departure came Micky was relieved to see that Charlie accepted it , and was even making it easy : and so touched was Micky by this that he found no difficulty in promising to spend that last night with Charlie alone . He remained in the house all day , and when the night came a misted moonlight gleamed on the cold roof and the sea was as quiet as the licking of a cat 's tongue . Charlie drew the curtains , made up the fire and there they sat silently listening to the clock . They were almost happy : Charlie pleased to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cairn , both disinterested . Charlie spoke of his plans , the work he would do in the garden , the furniture he would buy , the girl he would get in to cook and clean . " ' T would be a fine place to bring a bride to , " said Micky , giving Charlie a wink and Charlie smiled . But presently they heard footsteps on the drive . " What 's that ? " exclaimed Charlie sharply , sitting up . The mild mask of peace left his face like a light , and his face set hard . Without knocking at the door , in walked the schoolmaster . He was in the room before Charlie could get out . He stood up and retreated to the corner . " Good evening to ye , " said the schoolmaster , pulling a bottle out of his pocket , and spreading himself on to a seat . " I came to see your brother , on his last night . " Charlie drew in his lips and gazed at the school master . " Will ye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began it . Gradually Micky forgot his promise . He paid no attention to Charlie 's signs . They sat drinking and telling stories . The world span round . The alarm clock on the little bamboo table , the only table in the bare room , ticked on . Charlie waited in misery , his eyes craving his brother 's , whose bloodshot eyes were merry with drinking and laughter at the schoolmaster 's tales . The man 's vehement voice shook the house . He told of the priest at Dill who squared the jockeys and long thick stories about some archbishop and his so-called niece . The air to Charlie became profane . " Is n't your wife afraid to be up and alone this time of night ? " Charlie ventured once . " Och , man , she 's in bed long ago , " shouted the schoolmaster . " She is that . " And Micky roared with laughter . At two o'clock Charlie went to bed and left him to it . But he was awake at five when Micky stumbled into his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm bloody sorry , Charlie man . Could n't turn out a friend . " " It 's too late now , " said Charlie . Micky left at seven to catch a man who would give him a lift to the eight-o'clock train . T HE autumn gales broke loose upon the land a month after Micky 's departure and the nights streamed black and loud . The days were cold and fog came over the sea . The fuchsias were blown back and the under leaves blew up like silver hands . The rain lashed on the windows like gravel . There were days of calm and then the low week-long mist covered the earth , obliterating the mountains , melting all shapes . All day long the moisture dripped from the sheds and windows and glistened on the stone walls . At first Charlie did not change . Forced to go to the village for groceries he would appear there two or three times a week , saying little and walking away quickly . A fisherman would call and the postboy lingered . Letters came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as the weather became wilder he hung curtains over the windows day and night and brought his bed down to the sitting-room . He locked the doors upstairs , those that had still keys to them . He cooked on the sitting-room fire . He was narrowing his world , making a smaller and closer circle to live in . And as it grew smaller , the stranger the places beyond its boundaries seemer ' . He was startled to go into the empty kitch .. 1 , and looked with apprehension up the carpetless stairs to the empty landing where water dripped through the fanlight and was already staining the ceiling below . He lay awake in the night as the fire glowed in the room . One morning when he found the noises of his isolation supportable no more , he put on his hat and coat and packed his things and walked out of the house . He would stay no longer . But with his fear his brain had , as always , developed a covering cunning . He went up the lane to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from people , yet among them ; with them , yet alone . And on this morning the Ballady sailor was reloading a load of turf that had fallen off his cart . Charlie returned into the house . He took off his hat and coat . He had not been out for a week because of this dread . There was still food in tins for a few days . It was the thought that he could last if he liked , that he could keep the world off , that made him satisfied . No letters came now . Micky no longer wrote ; effusive in the first weeks , his letters had become rare . Now there had been no news for a month . Charlie scarcely thought of him . But when late in December the mists held the country finally , the twigs creaked on the drive like footsteps , and the dark bushes divided in the wind as if they had been parted by hidden hands , he cowered into his beating heart , eating little , and the memories began to move and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . He drove alone with the bank 's money . At Carragh-cross road , the signpost stood emptily gesticulating like some frightened speaker with the wind 414 driving back the words into his mouth , and the two roads dangling from its foot . He knew what had happened at Carragh-cross road . He knew what had been found there lying with one leg out of the ditch . He saw it . And Micky , the Destroyer , with his convict 's head and his big red ears , shooting down the Holy Ghost Like a beautiful bird , grinned there blowing smoke down his nose . These memories came and went . When they came they beat into his head like wings , and though he fought them off with prayers , they beat down and down on him and he cried out fast to the unanswering house . " God give me peace , " he prayed . " Holy Mother of God , give me peace for the sake of thy sweet Son . . . . " When the beating wings went his cleverness took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and once or twice walked around the garden within the shelter of the walls . The ground was frozen , the air still , and a lace of snow was on the paths . But if the days passed in peace , his heart quickened at the early darkness , and when the turf smoke blew back down the chimney it was as if someone had blown down a signal . One night he had a terrible dream . He was dead , he had been caught at last on the road at Carragh-cross . " Here 's the man with the pro-British brother , " they cried and threw him into a bog pool , sinking deeper and deeper into soft and sucking fires that drew him down and down . He was in hell . And there in the flames calling to him was a woman with dark hair and with pale insects walking over her skin . It was the schoolmaster 's wife . " And he thinking you were in bed , " said Charlie , amazed by the justice of revenge . He woke up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that a load was still pressing down on his chest . I N THE morning the dream was still in his mind ; mingling with some obscure sense of triumph it ceased to be a dream and became reality . It became like a new landscape imposed upon the world . The voice of the woman was more real to his ear than his own breathing . He felt free , was protected and cleansed , and his dream seemed to him like an impervious world within a world , a mirage in which he musically walked . In the afternoon he was exalted . He walked out of the house and taking the long way round by the lanes went to the schoolmaster 's . The frost still held and the air was windless , the land fixed and without color . As it happened the schoolmaster had taken it into his head to go as far as his gate . " Man , I 'm glad to see ye about , " cried the schoolmaster at the sight of Charlie . " I meant to see ye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible lonely for you in that place . " Charlie stood still and looked icily through him . " Ye thought she was in bed , " he said . " But I 'm after seeing her in the flames of hell fire . " Without another word he walked away . The schoolmaster made a rush for him . But Charlie had climbed the stone wall and had dropped into the field opposite . " Come here . Come back . What 's that you say ? " called the schoolmaster . But Charlie walked on , gathering speed as he dropped behind the hill out of sight going to his house . Then he ran for his life . The schoolmaster did not wait . He went in for his coat , bicycled into Ballady Post Office , and rang up the Guards at Dill . " There 's a poor feller here might do harm to himself , " he said . " Will you send someone down ? " But on the way back to the house Charlie 's accompanying dream and its dazed exaltation left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haze and suddenly he was left alone , exposed , vulnerable in the middle of the fields . He began to run , shying at every corner , and when he got to the house he clawed at the door and ran in gasping to throw himself on the bed . He lay there on his face , his eyes closed . There had been brief excitement in the run , but as he recovered his breath the place resumed its normal aspect and its horror became real as slowly he turned over and opened his eyes to it . And now they were open he could not close them again . They stared and stared . Slowly it came to him there was nothing in life left for him but emptiness . Career gone , peace gone . God gone , Micky gone , dog  --  all he had ever had , trooped with bleak salute of valediction through his mind . He was left standing in the emptiness of himself . And then a shadow was cast upon the emptiness ; looking up he saw the cold wing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that in this last moment his mind cleared and he had no fear . " ' T is yourself , Micky , has me destroyed , " he said . He took out a razor and became absorbed in the difficulty of cutting his throat . He was not quite dead when the Guards broke in and found him .
