Seldom have so many U.S. newspapers mounted such attacks on a President as they unleashed last week , and never have they so attacked Dwight Eisenhower . <P> When the President ordered paratroopers into Little Rock , it was predictable there would be an angry outcry from Southern newspapers ; only half a dozen of them-notably the Nashville Tennessean , the Chattanooga Times and the Louisville Courier-Journal-had endorsed the Supreme Court desegregation ruling . What was not to be expected was the violence or speed with which the South 's press turned directly on Ike , the moderate respecter of state sovereignty who has won warmer and more widespread support in Southern newspapers than any other Republican President . Grieved the Birmingham Post-Herald 's John Temple Graves , Dixie 's most widely distributed native pundit : " It is sad , remembering how he has been loved in the South , to sense the ' never , never , ' the totality of the Southern turnaway now , and the certainty that it will endure . And we loved him so . " <P> Leading the turnaway were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuked Ike for provoking a ' ' new pitch of sectional animosity , " and the Nashville Banner , which damned him for turning the South into a " zone of occupation for a replay of Reconstruction . " The Ike-minded Dallas News trumpeted that a Southern governor is now " a satrap-on-sufferance , removable or jailable on the order of a carpetbag judge . " " CAESARISM , " shrilled one of six anti-Eisenhower editorials in a single issue of the Charleston News and Courier . <P> From Nuts to Mud . Many Deep South dailies echoed the blunt sentiments of Little Rock 's street crowds . In Mississippi the Jackson Daily News 's fire-breathing editor , Major Fred Sullens , addressed a one-word editorial to the President : " Nuts . " ( New York 's Daily News picked up the editorial and flung it back under the headline : MISSISSIPPI MUD . ) In Louisiana the Shreveport Journal added its jeer : " Heil Eisenhower ! Heil to der great Fuehrer ! " A more flattering comparison was made , however , by Mississippi 's famed Hodding Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot to dictate his state 's only editorial endorsing President Eisenhower 's constitutional position : " We go along with the first President and the present President . " <P> Puffing on the coals of martyrdom , some Southern editors indulged in such overblown headlines as the seven-column banner in the Danville ( Va . ) Bee : <P> <P> SOLDIER BAYONETS WHITE MAN . ( On the other hand , some Northern editors , among them those of the Chicago Tribune , felt the need to tone down their reporting by substituting Negro and Negro-lover for " nigger " and " nigger-lover , " as bandied about by the Little Rock mob. )
