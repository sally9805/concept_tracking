New York Times Troubled by New York 's seeming indifference to the world 's serious state , James Reston , the distinguished Washington correspondent of the New York Times , last week sought an explanation . He found New Yorkers did care  --  and very much so // Q.  --  I 've come to New York to see whether anybody 's paying any attention to what 's going on in Washington . // A.  --  We sure are . The Yankees have one more game there and if they do n't win it , they 're through . // Q.  --  Yes , but I mean  --  // A.  --  And they 'd better win the last three with Washington at the Stadium too . // Q.  --  I mean Washington in general . The big things that have been happening down there recently . What do you really think of Washington ? // A.  --  Strictly a second-division club . Nothing 's happened down there since Walter Johnson . They ca n't hit and they 're weak down the middle . If Stengel had n't given them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YANKEE-INDIAN COEXISTENCE ? // Q.  --  Let me be specific . I 'd like to ask you about some of the things of world importance that are being widely discussed where I come from . For example , the policy of coexistence . // A.  --  It 's for the birds . That 's exactly what 's wrong with Stengel . He 's been coexisting with Cleveland too much . Nine times , in fact . He even coexists with Washington . Last year he beat ' em fourteen times and lost only six . This year he 's beaten them only eleven times , less than he 's beaten any other club in the league , while Cleveland 's beaten them seventeen times . See what I mean ? This " coexistence " is the bunk . Stengel should leave it to the Orioles. // Q.  --  What do you think of the Dixon-Yates deal ? // A.  --  I did n't even know they 'd been traded . // Q.  --  What do you think of Eisenhower ? // A.  --  He 's a golfer . // Q.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy around here ? // A.  --  Talk about it ! The Yankees invented it ! In the old days , when anybody scored one run on them , " murderers row " retaliated with five . That 's what we 've been waiting for here in New York  --  massive retaliation , especially against those bums in Cleveland ! // THE REAL McCARTHY // Q.  --  What do you think of McCarthy ? // A.  --  As I say , he was a great manager . One of the best the Yankees ever had . // Q.  --  I do n't suppose he ever coexisted with anybody , did he ? // A.  --  Never ! And he did n't wait to re-taliate , either . He taliated ! // Q.  --  Have you ever heard of " united action " ? // A.  --  Not since Billy Martin went into the Army . There 's absolutely nothing united in the Yankee infield around second base , and Stengel puts so many players on the field that they get most of their action running on and off the field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Reds ? // A.  --  I do n't care what happens in the National League . Cincinnati has always been a problem anyway . // Q.  --  I get the impression you 're interested in baseball . Do n't you ever worry about politics ? // A.  --  Once in a while , but I never seem to get anywhere . The thing I like about baseball is that everybody starts even , and at the end of the day you know who won . Politics  --  you never know who 's ahead . // Q.  --  Here is Indochina partitioned , the EDC rejected , the Communists running all over Asia , and France in a mess , and you do n't care ? // A.  --  Sure I care , but what can I do about a country that partitions Indochina , rejects the EDC and abolishes the female bosom all in six months ? // Q.  --  The President says  --  // A.  --  Where is the President ? // Q.  --  He 's in Denver , but  --  // A.  --  He has n't given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he says  --  // A.  --  I know , but he also says this Cold War may go on for a lifetime . That 's all you get  --  one lifetime to a customer . Am I to abandon Stengel until Dulles civilizes the Russians ? Poor Casey is having a hard enough time as it is. // A QUESTION OF TIMING // Q.  --  I admire your local pride but why Stengel ? What about the Giants and the Dodgers ? // A.  --  Bushers ! // Q.  --  Bushers ? // A.  --  Bush-leaguers . They play the kind of ball the Russians invented . Winning the American League pennant is like winning a Democratic primary in the South . After that , the Republicans are easy . // Q.  --  So you are interested in politics ? // A.  --  I time my interest . When things are really bad , and it looks like a war or a depression , I pay attention . Occasionally , when I 'm determined to be gloomy , I read Joe Alsop , but most of the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russians and the French , the EDC , and the British , Senator McCarthy and Senator Watkins  --  when do you plan to worry about them ? // A.  --  Later .
