txt The city has called upon the Consolidated Edison Company to report today on the cause of the power failure that blacked out five square miles of upper Manhattan Monday night and disrupted the lives of 500,000 people . Armand D'Angelo , Commissioner of Water Supply , Gas and Electricity , also asked the comTany what measures were being taken to prevent a recurrence of the blackout . An investigation of the breakdown was being made by twenty electrical engineers of Mr. D'Angelo 's department . Mr. D'Angelo said he would , compare the two reports and send his findings to Mayor Wagner late this week or early next week . The State Public Service Commission also opened an investigation of the failure . Power Gradually Returns Power was restored to the upper West Side at 3:42 A. M. yesterday after a blackout of nearly thirteen hours . The upper East Side , paralyzed by the same breakdown , was brought out of darkness at 10:50 P. M. Monday after an eight-hour eclipse . Last night , as an aftermath of the power failure , street lights in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Side Highway failed to go on automatically about 8 P. M. as scheduled . The areas affected in the park were on the East Side from Seventy-ninth to Eighty-fourth Street and on the West Side from Eighty-first to Eightyeighth Street . On the highway , lights were out from Eightysixth to 110th Street . Break in Park Circuit Consolidated Edison reported that the lights in Central Park were out because the secondary wires that supply power to them had to be cut Monday night during the power failure . The park lights were expected to be back in operation today . The cause of the failure on the highway was the timing devices that had been put out of kilter by Monday 's power failure . Because these devices had not been reset , they were functioning thirteen hours behind schedule . These lights went on again at 12:30 A. M. today . Consolidated Edison said yesterday that the cause of Monday 's power failure was not known . The failure was generally believed to have resulted from the burning out of cables overloaded by the heavy use of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical failure seemed of less . concern to New Yorkers than , the way the city reacted to the crisis . Half a million people were suddenly deprived of light , // . refrigeration. radio . TV , elevator service and air coolers . The , stricken districts contained every stratum of society , from East Side millionaires to impoverished Puerto Ricans in teeming West Side slums . Plunged into primitive dark-'I ness were streets with a high incidence of crime , and Central Parlc , notorious for muggings . In these areas the approach of nightfall brought dread . Yet Police Commissioner Stephen P. Kennedy was able to report that crime had actually decreased during the blackout . Two autos were stolen . Two windows were broken . Two pockets were picked . He offered no theory for this phenomenon but suggested that the crisis had somehow " brought out the best instincts " in everybody . The " saturation " of the affected area by 1,200 patrolmen and detectives might have helped . However Commissioner Kennedy took a more mellow view . f'Undoubtedly the prompt police reinforcement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but the main reason why the unlighted streets were not tigned into a dark and steaming jungle was the reaction of the community . fThe people of the area faced a difficult challenge and rose above it . In the vast majority of cases the emergency was faced in a spirit of understanding and cooperation . In an area with a serious crime problem , the rate of crime actually decreased radically . tit is indeed ironical that it took a major crisis such as yesterday 's to bring out the best instincts of the community . In the dark all men were the same color . In the dark our fellow man was seen more clearly than in. the normal light of a New York night . " commissioner Kennedy said the city , an amalgam of many national , religious and racial groups , " must have the power of understanding " to function . " Yesterday proves that such Understanding and cooperation can exist , " he added . Law and order were preserved , he-said , by " the combination of large numbers of police and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Precincts in the affected areas reported a 50 per cent drop in crime compared with a normal Monday afternoon and evening , the Commissioner said . Although traffic lights went out , few street accidents were reported and there were no injuries , he reported . " Ambulance calls to assist persons suddenly fallen ill or injured in home accidents were also 50 per cent below normal , and there were few injuries traceable to the power failure itself , ' he continued . " Three persons were slightly Injured in apartment buildings on the West Side of Manhattan and two on the East Side while climbing or descending stairs in darkened hallways . One was injured slightly while descending the stairway of the IRT subway at Eighty-sixth Street and Lexington Avenue . " Over 1,200 patrolmen and detectives covered the streets and avenues affected by the blackout on foot and in radio motor patrol cars , unmarked cars , motorcycles and emergency patrol cars . " The public was requested to remain at home and away from public places . The request was made by direct contact between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of public announcements made through r ortable bull horns carried in radio motor patrol cars . " The public , after early inquiries to Police Headquarters , soon settled down quietly to await the end of the power failin-e . After the rush hour , there Were few persons to be seen on the streets . Many families sat I- , stoops but remained close to their tnt doors . " 7-affic dropped heavily in vol ae and moved slowly but easily despite the lack of traffic lights . All important intersections were manned by traffic officers . Only three collisions were reported in the six precincts , approximately 20 per cent of the average volume of strc t accidents in the period . No one was injured . " Crime decreased . Two men reported having their pockets picked to the Twentieth Precinct , one on the lRT , the other on a Fifth Avenue bus . Two windows were broken by juveniles . Two automobiles were reported stolen . " In the Twenty-fourth Precinct , two girls were arrested for juvenile delinquency in an attempted purse match at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Side ) , two men , both Jersey City residents , were arrested for possession of burglar tools after a detective saw them examining parked cars . They carried tools used in opening auto ventilator windows . " Other officials were in a con- , gratulatory mood . They included Charles L. Patterson , chair-I man of the Transit Authority The signal system of the IND Subway had been knocked out by the power failure , and trains were halted for forty-five minutes Monday afternoon . Thereafter trains moved slowly , and it was not until 6:06 A. M. yesterday that normal service was resumed . Mr. Patterson said at a press interview : " I think our people did an excellent job . Our trains were moving , That 's the important thing . When I heard about the failure yesterday , I instructed my men : ' Spare no expense . Keep the railroad going . ' " Economic loss from the blackout was held down by the fact that power was restored before there was any major food spoilage . Yesterday , 100 Health Department inspectors began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food stores in the affected area . They sniffed and pinched tons of meat and frozen poultry for softness . Although the blackout caused great waste and doubled work for garbage collectors , only 9,380 pounds of food was found spoiled in the 579 commercial establishments visited . This was less than 1 per Scent of the 470 tons of food the inspectors had examined up to 4 P. M. The inspectors condemned 2,384 pounds of meat and poultry ; thirty-five pounds of fish and 6,961 pounds of frozen food , ice cream and cheese . Not one case of illness from spoiled food was reported to the Health Department from the blackout areas . The inspections will continue today . The Health Department received 300 calls from housewives who reported that some food in their defrosted iceboxes smelled , ' looked or tasted strange . " Throw it out , " was the invariable advice from Health Department officials . Hospitals got by in good shape , deferring major surgery and performing only a few emergency operations under makeshift lighting . One child was delivered in the beams of flashlights. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
