ASHLEY MONTAGU is a British-born anthropologist who now practices his trade in this country . According to some ladies of my acquaintance whose competence in such matters is beyond dispute , he is irresistible on television , but on the printed page , or at least on the printed page of his new book , The Cultured Man ( World , $3.75 ) , resistance comes more easily . The book is made up of two sections . The first and shorter section is an essay in which Montagu describes his conception of a cultured man . It is a loosely thought out and shoddily expressed piece of work , a collection of unsupported assertions and hasty generalizations that make pretty good sense if they are read fast enough . But with more careful reading , and some reflection , they seem not quite to describe the real world , but instead a world in which problems axe simpler and solutions easier than they are in the world we know . A typical passage is the one in which Montagu lays down the law on prejudice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes . " He will not make judgments on insufficient evidence . " That seems to me an account of the matter so oversimplified as to be useless . I doubt that anyone is free of prejudices ( certainly Montagu shows that he has plenty of them ) , and I believe that we have to make many of our judgments on insufficient evidence , simply because life often does not wait to be lived until sufficient evidence is accumulated . If there were such a being as a cultivated man , he probably would not be foolish enough to suppose that he could divest himself of his prejudices by a simple act of the will . He would know that he had grown up in a particular time and place and that the circumstances of his life had left their mark upon him . He would try to be aware of his prejudices and to see that they did not . victimize either himself or others ; he would accept them as part of the truth about himself that must be lived with , but he would not accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would stand to be corrected ? that is , he would have courage enough to make decisions when decisions had to be made , even if the basis for making them was flimsy , but he would have the honesty to admit that he was wrong when further experience showed him his error . He would not declare himself free of prejudices simply because prejudice happened to be a dirty word in the journalism of the moment ; he would try to understand what role prejudice actually played in his life and in the lives of others , and where it operated necessarily as well as where it was needless . T H E second and longer section of The Cultured Man is a series of quizzes on all the main branches of knowledge . The reader is supposed to take the quizzes and keep an elaborate score on his own performance , in order to see how cultured he is or to arrive at what Montagu calls his " culture quotient . " I did not discover what my culture quotient is , because I started with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning with the area of knowledge where I might expect to do best , and I found so many mistakes in the answers that I saw no reason to go on . Here are some mistakes that occur within a few pages : " Chaucer called his 7-line stanza rhyme royal , in pentameter couplets , later it was called heroic couplets . " All of that is wrong . Chaucer could not have called his 7-line stanza rhyme royal : it was given that lofty title only after it was used by King James I of Scotland in his poem The Kingis Quair , which was written about a quarter of a century alter Chaucer died . Furthermore , rhyme royal is not entirely in couplets ( it is impossible to write a 7-line stanza entirely in couplets ) , and heroic couplets is not a later name for rhyme rorl : it is the name for something else . " Orlando is ... a novel by Virginia Woolf . " Doubtless it was a little whimsical of Mrs. Woolf to call Orlando a biography , but surely it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Brown 's Body is . . . a drama in verse . " It is in verse all right , but it is not a drama . " Paradise Lost is ... an epic poem in ten books . " Oddly enough , the first edition was in ten books , but Milton later made it into twelve , and so it is almost always printed now . " The composer of The Beggar 's Opera .. . is John Gay . No , jolt ! ' Gay wrote what we would call the book ; the composer was John Christopher Pepusch , though the airs were traditional . Some of Montagu 's answers are correct in a dictionary sense but , like his introductory essay , show a limited acquaintance with the facts of life ? e.z. : " An operetta is a short , amusing , musical play . " But at bottom what is wrong with The Cut-lured Man is not that Montagu writes carelessly or makes mistakes in the answers to his questions ; what is wrong is the book 's very conception , the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can tell whether or not people arc civilized by counting the number of odd facts they have lying around in their beads . No one is less " cultured " for not knowing the metrical pattern of rhyme royal or the name of an obscure Anglo-German composer who arranged the music for Gay 's plays ( I had some trouble finding it myself ) , but certainly no one is more cultured for thinking he knows such things when he knows them wrong . Probably a really cultured man could get a good deal of not entirely innocent fun our of The Cultured Man , but for those of us who still have a long way to go , it does not seem to be a wholly reliable guide . A WORLD RESTORED A FTER Montagu 's fragmentation of cullure into odds and ends of information and attitude , it is refreshing to turn to Mary Renault 's new novel , The King Must Die ( Pantheon , ? 1.50 ) , because it is an attempt , and a remarkably successful one , CO take a world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Miss Renault has chosen as her subject the myth of Theseus , whose most famous adventure culminated in the slaying of the Minotaur , after penetrating the Labyrinth with the aid of Ariadne 's wcb . She sets the story in the Aegean Bronze Age , and tells it from the point of view of Theseus himself . The myth as it survives is of course a series of startling , wildly improbable , but exciting events , and what Miss Renault has tried to do is to show how , to a certain kind of man at a certain stage of history , it might all have made sense . To accomplish this she draws Theseus as a youngman whose chief characteristic must be called , for want of a better word , piety . Theseus is not pious in the modern sense of being quiet , self-abnegating , and puritanical ; on the contrary he is intensely active , a born fighter and promiscuous in love , proud and bold , clever and barbaric . But he is pious in the sense that he believes that life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the terms of the contract . The object of a man 's life is to know " the shape of his fate " ; to consent to the fate the gods have shaped for him is to be free . Since Theseus comes from a line of kings in an age when kings are also priests , he stands in a special relation to the gods ; his fate is particularly grand and may be particularly grim , for the king must always be ready to die as a sacrifice for his people , and to live in expectation of a more comfortable end is to fail fully to be a king . Hence the title : The King Must Die . Because.of her skill in creating this attitude of heroic piety , Miss Renault is able to achieve a remarkable credibility for the ancient myth . However strange and unlikely the events that befall her Theseus , he accepts them simply as manifestations of the divine , and the reader soon finds himself equally credulous . Miss Renault alters the legend in certain details to make it more acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minotaur in her story is no longer half-man and half-bull , as he is in the myth , but only a very bull-like man ) , and she certainly succeeds in convincing the reader that this is what the world might once have looked like to men . Theseus is represented as anything but literary , and since he tells the story , the prose is appropriately simple , masculine , almost brusque . The story begins slowly , but the concluding section ? the account of Theseus ' adventures at the diseased and decadent court of the Cretan Minos ? is very brilliant . ( A Book-of-the-Month Club selection . ) DEATH or A KIN r ; A NO THER new novel that is built on an ancient mythic pattern , though perhaps unconsciously , is The Horn , by John Clellon Holmes ( Random House , $3.75 ) . The characters arc Negro jail musicians in contemporary Manhattan , but the situation recalls the myth of the ancient priest-king who guarded the golden bough in the sacred grove at Nemi . His watch was sleepless , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose it when he in turn was slain by his successor . The myth is an expression , among various other things , of the guilt of the young who must dispossess the old , and of the tragedy of the old who must surrender . 86 THE NEW BOOKS The main character in The Horn , the old king , is a man who has been the greatest jazz trumpeter of his time , known simply as " The Horn . " The story opens on a night when a young trumpeter steps up beside The Horn and takes him on in musical combat . The youngster is almost unknown , but he is very good ; the old man has known too many one-night stands , too many adoring audiences , too many drinks and " fixes " and women and years . His time has come . Unwilling to acknowledge defeat , The Horn latches onto a desperate hope to disguise from himself that the sacred grove of jazz has passed into the keeping of a new king : he tells himself that if he can only raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be himself again . So he stumbles drunkenly through nighttime New York and tries to make a little money by sitting in with various jazz groups , but he is too sick to play , humiliated by the laughter of the audience and the desertion of the younger musicians . The closest he gets to Kansas City is Bellevue . HOLMES has attempted to give his novel something of the structure of jazz by using its terms to label various flashbacks and asides with which he fills out his account of The Horn 's last days . but his writing has certain qualities that I suspect he would not admire in music . There is a strain of pretentiousness in the book ? the chapters are introduced with quotations from the most respected classic American writers ; sometimes there are flights that can only he described as prose poems , and that hear about the same resemblance to good prose as tone poems bear to good jazz ; Holmes is a little too fond of phrases like " the raw immensity of American night , " which sounds pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really any larger than it is elsewhere . But Holmes 's writing is less blowzy than the writing of most people who try to make novels out of the world of jazz. ; he has a powerful situation which is developed effectively : and many of the scenes , especially those that are simply descriptive , are excellent . The Horn is certainly one of the two or three best novels about jazz that I have read . PORTRAIT OF A SOCIETY ANTHONY POWELLbelongs to a group of English novelists who are not at all interested in the mythic dimension of fiction ; they stick very close to the surface facts of society , and their novels often seem to be less fiction than memoirs . The member of the group best known in this country is C. P. Snow . He and Powell are both engaged in writing an extended series of books depicting English society in the last thirty or forty years . Both are writers of no great imaginative power , but with intelligence , accomplished prose styles , and extensive experience closely and shrewdly scrutinized . Probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader than Powell 's , because the kind of subject Snow deals with ? the struggle for power in a university or the civil service or among " the new men " of atomic science ? is not very different from the kind of thing that goes on in American society . Powell 's subject , on the other hand , is much more peculiarly British : since the series is not yet complete it may be premature to guess what the subject of the whole will be , but it seems to be the breakup of the English class system since the first world war . And Powell 's attitude toward his subject may be less exportable than Snow 's . Powell is a comic writer , and to read comedy one needs some acquaintance with the social usages underlying it . At Lady Molly 's , Powell 's latest book ( Little , Brown , $3.75 ) , takes its title from the household of a London hostess of the 1930s , a woman who first married into the aristocracy and then married into nothing in particular . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still come to her house . Her parties are a symbol of the social confusion of the times , a meeting place for all kinds of human odds and ends who would once not have mei socially . Powell presents his social gallery with wit and incisiveness , and an amusing group of people they are . Yet the book reads more like a I chapter from a novel than lik novel in itself . More and n characters are introduced , but n ing in particular happens . character becomes engaged and other unengaged , a woman who been living with one man goes to China with another , and so one keeps waiting for a story to gin that is n't there , though sharpness of the observation and wit in the writing make At .1 Molly 's an entertaining book . DORIS LESSINGis an En ; writer associated with a genera younger than Powell 's and Sm she contributed a piece to volume of essays by the " angry yi men " recently published uncle title Declaration . But in fact fiction , as represented in a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crowell , $4 ) , does have much in common with stories of the " angry young rn ? Although Miss Lessing is a f sophical Marxist , there is litt no social protest in her book . best single story in The Hob Loving is a sketch of what hapj to a young woman writer or day Stalin died . She has lunch a bishop 's spinster daughter wh passionate Communist and spends the lunch hour beratin for the lack of class struggle social consciousness in her Then the young woman spent afternoon with a complacent , neering Tory aunt who suf that since her niece is a write must spend her days in unmc able but fascinating Bohemia tics . If I read the story cor Miss Lessing is trying to shoe these two women are equally rant of what a writer 's work is like , that for all their ideol differences they are equally and meddling creatures . As a group , the best stories i Habit of Loving are several in loneliness with South Attic tings , especially a couple of sto which women are driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dom , and a touching accoun girl who chooses a life of pi Lion in Johannesburg ratheT go back to the isolated railro ing where her parents live . The collection ends with a long story about an English couple in Germany in the 1950s . It is not a complete success , being somewhat too heavily symbolic in its method , but it certainly conveys a disquieting impression of postwar Germany . Miss Lessing is a finished , literate writer . There is nothing theatrical about her stories and sometimes little that is dramatic , but each makes its quiet point effectively . UNLUCKY JAKE T H E influence of the younger English writers with whom Miss Lessing is associated is beginning to show itself in American fiction ? John Barth 's new novel . The End of the Road ( Doubleday . S3.95 ) , bears more than casual resemblances to Kingsley Antis ' Lucky Jim in its manner , as it also shows more than casual acquaintance with French existentialism in its ideas . Yet The End of the Road is not by any means an entirely derivative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tar more freshness , more wit and invention , and more intellectual life of its own than most recent American fiction . It is a horrifying book too , and neither the vocabulary nor the situations will recommend themselves to the squeamish . The main character , one . lake Horner , who also tells the story , is an amusing , neurotic young man without purpose or object in life . He is in every way the antithesis of Theseus in Miss Renault 's The King Must Di ? ? utterly unheroic , unable to take himself or anything- else seriously , too lacking in character to have a fate , without conviction that anything he does matters . Sonic time before the novel opens he collapsed into complete immobility in a railroad station in Baltimore and spent a night sitting there without movement because he could think of no reason to move . In this state he was found by an eccentric Negro psychiatrist , either charlatan or genius and possibly both , who took him to his farm , a kind of clandestine hospital , where the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are supposed to restore them to movement . For Jake the doctor prescribes what he calls " mythotherapy " ; he argues that a human being has no essential nature . no fate in the sense of a character that is given him ; life is a form of play-acting in which we write our own scripts and choose our own parts and create our own myths , and the " authentic " man , the man of integrity , is simply the man who plays his own part convincingly . Jake is sufficiently helped by the doctor 's treatment to take a job on the faculty of a small teachers ' college on the eastern shore of Maryland , but there he meets an energetic and charming young colleague , Joe Morgan , who preaches a gospel exactly the opposite of the doctor 's . Joe Morgan believes that it is possible to be absolutely sincere , that integrity is achieved by stripping away all play-acting and all pretense until we reach the bedrock of our natures . He is an impressive young man and , like the doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be unfair to tell how the conflict between these two attitudes is worked out in the story , but it is permissible to say that the character who really bears the brunt of the conflict is be Morgan 's wife Rennie , a pleasant , wholesome young woman whose life is wrecked between Jake 's play-acting and her husband 's cult of sincerity . 1 am not quite sure what it all means ; perhaps it is a rejoinder of sorts to Socrates ' famous observation that the unexamined life is not worth living , for certainly it shows that it life is examined too closely it may be made unfit for living too . The book is comic in manner but tragic in its events ; perhaps it simply means that we have turned our powers of analysis upon our lives with such brutal thoroughness , denied their mystery so completely . that there is nothing left to do but laugh at the destruction we have wrought . HOLLIS ALPERT 'S novel . The Summer Lovers ( Knopf. $3-95 ) , is a book that poses no problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually reviewed at this season under the general category of hammock reading ? at the saute 88 time reasonably entertaining and gently soporific . The main character is a charming , worldly woman in early middle age who has recently acquired a new husband . He is an attractive but caddish political scientist who has married her chiefly because she is rich enough not to put any strain on his modest academic income . It is a marriage convenient enough all around , except that the woman has a beautiful daughter who has been in love with her mother 's husband for a long time , a feeling that he does n't exactly reciprocate but is perfectly willing to take advantage of . The setting is a fashionable summer resort on Long Island , and around the central triangle Mr. Alpert has arranged a variety of well-drawn characters such as might he encountered at such a place ? an illustrator of children 's books , who takes the marriage relationship rather more seriously than most of his neighbors , and his former wife , who does not ; a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is in love with the junior member of the triangle and gets little reward for his pains ; and so on , The Summer Lovers is undemanding and unimportant , agreeably written and a pleasant enough way to spend a summer afternoon . I N The Hours after Midnight ( Random House , $3 ) , Joseph Hayes has written a brief , dramatic novel about juvenile delinquency that manages to combine an exciting story with considerable psychological and moral insight . The action begins when a girl from one of the " nice " families in a small . American city quarrels with the socially acceptable young man who has been taking her out . They are having something to eat at the end of a date when the quarrel erupts ; she tells the young man to go home without her and he is angry enough to do it . Then she asks a leather-jacketed , side-burned boy from the wrong side of the tracks to take her home . Once this boy gets her in his car he realizes that at last he has in his power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuff and ignore him , and his sick young mind hatches an illformed but extremely dangerou scheme of using the girl for revenge What follows is a skillfully plotter chase , in the course of which eau of the major characters discovers th weakness or inadequacy or inistaLi choice that has brought him or hr to this situation . Hayes probabl contributes nothing new to th causes of juvenile delinquency the others have suggested , but he mar ages to give them considerabi dramatic force . He avoids the eas solution that everything is society fault , which , since " society " is a ways other people , neatly excuse ourselves ; though he does not lei . parents off easily he does not put tt entire blame on them . In fact , or of the best things in the book is tl girl 's slow and painful realiza tie that she bears some of the respo ' sibility for the plight she is in .

My guess ? and it is nothing more than a guess ? is that it is not very reliable in detail but fairly reliable in the general impression it creates . Mrs. Kaufman says that she did not keep a diary during the years she recounts , and even if she had it would be difficult to believe that the long conversations she reports and her very detailed accounts of what happened on particular occasions could be anything but imaginary -reconstructions . Yet the speeches she ascribes to O'Neill are generally convincing ? they sound like the talk of a man whose favorite reading was Nietzsche and the Saturday Evening Post .

The portraits of O'Neill 's father and older brother in Mrs. Kaufman 's book bear a strong resemblance to the portraits O'Neill drew of them in his autobiographical play , A Long Day 's Journey into Night , except that the brother is older and more pathetic . His mother , on the other hand , is presented as stylish , handsomely dressed , gracious and affectionate ? rather different from the ruined woman in the play .
