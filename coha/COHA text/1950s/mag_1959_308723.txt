<P> An undeclared and mostly bloodless duel is being fought for the control of Indonesia 's 3,000 islands and its 85.5 million people . The well-matched opponents are the only two organizations in the nation that are European in structure , efficiency and administration : 1 ) the army , under Lieut . General Abdul Haris Nasution , 40. 2 ) the Communist Party , under the leadership of Secretary-General Dipa Nusantara Aidit , 36 . These days the Communists are taking a silent licking . <P> Broken Strike . At the Soviet 's 21st Party Congress in Moscow last January , slim , supple Red Boss Aidit could boast the best vote-getting Communist Party outside the Iron Curtain , and he promised Nikita Khrushchev that Indonesian Reds would deliver 8,000,000 ballots if elections " were held tomorrow " ( in the 1957 regional election the Reds became Indonesia 's top party with 6,940,000 votes ) . All this had been done in a scant ten years , for Communist prestige in Indonesia was at zero after the Reds tried to pull a coup in 1948 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had problems too . He lingered in . Moscow long after the Congress was over , presumably to explain his difficulties . <P> Aidit 's strength , outside a disciplined party of up to 1,500,000 members , rests on half a dozen well-infiltrated Indonesian mass organizations that loyally support Communism 's interests . They include : the labor confederation SOBSI ( 2,750,000 ) , the Pemuda Rakjut youth organization ( 800,000 ) , the Perbepsi veterans group ( 200,000 ) , the peasant B.T.I. ( 250,000 ) and the Gerwani women 's movement ( 75,000 ) . Western intelligence officers also believe that there are 300 secret party members in " sensitive and unsuspected " government positions . <P> Only the army has successfully resisted Red penetration , and gone over to the attack . Last April General Nasution , who is not so much pro-Western as pro his country 's independence , banned the biggest Red weapon-mass demonstrations- and followed it with an order prohibiting strikes . When SOBSI recklessly decided on a test of strength and called a plantation strike in Sumatra , the army swiftly broke it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police jailed eleven known Communists , seized caches of small arms and munitions . <P> Kiss for the Girls . The Reds turned for help to President Sukarno , whom they had strongly supported-and tried to make their captive-when the Sumatra colonels began their 1958 right-wing revolt in the Outer Islands . Two years ago , dissatisfied with the role of Indonesia 's three leading non-Communist parties , Sukarno had called for Communist participation in the government because " a horse ca n't stand on three legs . " Now an officer boasts that the army " will provide the fourth leg . " <P> As Red Boss Aidit slowly journeyed home from Moscow , with stops at the Soviet Asian city of Tashkent , where his wife is studying medicine , and at Peking in Red China , he got word that President Sukarno had decided to go back to the old constitution of 1945 , to include 35 army officers in his government , and to exclude the Reds from the Cabinet and from major governmental posts .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
