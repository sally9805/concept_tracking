Monterey , a pleasant , picturesque seafaring town 125 miles down the California coast from San Francisco , includes among its 16,000 population two notable linguistic groups : the sardine fishermen , who speak Portuguese , and the U.S. Army and Air Force men , who speak in many tongues-Russian , Arabic , French , Spanish , Portuguese , Italian , German , Chinese ( both Cantonese and Mandarin ) , Japanese , Korean , Albanian , Bulgarian , Czech , Persian , Hungarian , Rumanian , Greek , Polish , Turkish , Serbo-Croatian , Danish , Norwegian and Swedish . Last week 190 new officers and men arrived in town . Within eleven months , most of them will also be speaking new languages with rapid-fire fluency . <P> For ten years , the Army Language School has been preparing corporals , captains , and colonels alike for jobs as interpreters , attaches and occupation officials . The school began with only 60 students and one language ( Japanese ) , but grew until it now has an enrollment of 933 , a curriculum of 24 languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its methods are far removed from ordinary U.S. language teaching . " The one word I object to around here , " says Colonel Charles Barnwell , the C.O. , " is grammar . We do n't burden the student with masses of rules and exceptions . Our big ambition is to make a man speak and understand . " The speaking begins right in the first class . " Are you a student ? " a Danish instructor will demand . " Ja , jeg er elev " Yes , I am a student , the class must learn to answer . " Is he a student ? " asks the instructor . " Ja , han er ogsaa . " A class may consist of only one student , is never larger than eight . The men average 30 hours in class and 15 at outside study a week . <P> At first , students are not bothered with spelling ; most of their homework is with phonograph records , and the textbooks they do use are spelled phonetically . Gradually , after weeks of listening to long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read , starting with simple cartoon captions and working up to newspapers and regular books . Meanwhile in class and mess hall , they converse constantly , act out skits ( e.g. , parachuting into enemy territory ) , see movies with foreign languages dubbed in ( among them : The True Glory , with General Dwight D. Eisenhower speaking a rippling , dubbed-in Portuguese ) . Finally , near the end of the course , students cut their way through a jungle of diplomatic , technical and military terms , until such formidable words as protivotankovoe ruzhie ( Russian for anti-tank rifle ) come tripping off the tongue . <P> Original Goethe . The school 's faculty are all civilians , but not all trained teachers . One Czech instructor was a judge in Prague ; a Russian was the son of a czarist general ; a Rumanian D.P. was a stock boy in a Detroit department store . But in their own lands , many were noted scholars ; they have come to the school via concentration camps , from jobs as elevator men and lemon pickers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they keep in touch with student problems , all teachers must put in time on an unfamiliar language .
