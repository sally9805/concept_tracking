In Texas , scandals in the insurance and real estate business have given newspapers one Page One story after another . Last week the Texas papers had a new scandal to print , and this one was embarrassing . It concerned the press itself . In Waco , a grand jury indicted Vern Sanford , general manager of the Texas Press Association ( 60 dailies , 525 weeklies ) , on charges of violating the state 's law on political contributions . Maximum penalty : a $5,000 fine and five years in prison . Said District Attorney Tom Moore of Waco , who presented the case : the press association has been used as " a blind drop for big political contributions . " <P> The indictment was the result of digging , not by a newsman but an aggrieved politician , C. T. Johnson , 45 , who was roundly beaten in the 1954 primary for lieutenant governor by Ben Ramsey . When Johnson checked heavy newspaper advertising for Ramsey , he found little of it listed in the candidate 's sworn statement of campaign expenditures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared through the candidate or one of his campaign officials , who are required to list them . When Johnson checked further , he found that the Texas Press Association had placed at least $11,000 of Ramsey ads-about $1,000 more than Ramsey had reported spending on his whole campaign . <P> Poor Memory . Johnson sued the lieutenant governor , the Texas Press Association and Sanford under a law entitling a defeated candidate to damages double the amount of money illegally spent on a political campaign . He also laid his evidence before an Austin grand jury . The jury brushed him off . Then Johnson went before the Waco grand jury , headed by a man with a special interest in the election law . The foreman , Dean Abner V. McCall of the Baylor University School of Law , rewrote the law in 1951 . <P> When the grand jury summoned Sanford , he proved to have a poor memory . He admitted accepting $11,000 to pay for Ramsey advertising in Texas Press Association papers , but he insisted that he could not remember where the money came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am quite sure he did n't , " said Sanford . Did anyone authorize the ads ? " Well , I do n't exactly know . . . I do n't recall who may have prepared them . " In a sworn deposition Ramsey said he could not remember paying for , authorizing or even seeing the ads in the papers . <P> Loyal Support . After the jury indicted Sanford , the district attorney said : " You ca n't tell me a man 's going to lay $11,000 in your hand , and you not remember it . And when you 'd donate it , you 'd tell the candidate you did it . " At week 's end Sanford was getting support from Russell Bryant , president of the T.P.A. and publisher of the Italy ( Texas ) News-Herald , who pooh-poohed the charges as political . Said Bryant : " Certainly we 'll back him up . He did n't do anything wrong . "
