To dam a flood of foreign oil-and to soothe the politically potent ire of Texas ' independent oilmen-the Interior Department two months ago set up a voluntary import curb on big oil companies . Last week the program 's administrator . Navy Captain Matthew V. Carson Jr .. logged a mutinous crew and foul weather ahead . The companies were asked to cut imports 10% below their 1954-to-1956 levels , bring in only 755,700 bbl. of foreign crude a day . But Captain Carson 's first statistics showed a daily August total of 982,300 bbl . The companies themselves estimate daily imports from now through December at 849,300 bbl . Though he professed no dismay . Carson warned tautly : " The only alternative to this program is mandatory action by the President , and I feel certain that such action will be taken if the program breaks down . " <P> Failure Ahead . There were plenty of signs last week that it might . The pressure against the quota came from companies that only recently began bringing in foreign crude . The quotas , based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocated a total of only 262,600 bbl. daily , they imported 354,600 bbl. a day in August , estimate a 337,200-bbl. rate in December . Both Tidewater and Standard of Indiana appealed for quota boosts , held that the formula has actually cut their imports 22% below the levels they had planned to supply recently built U.S. refineries that are processing foreign crude . Tidewater charged the curb meant " confiscation " of its new $200 million refinery in Delaware City , Del . <P> Even an established importer , Sinclair Oil Corp. , asked for relief , demanded a quota boost from 62,200 bbl. daily to 74,800 . At a hearing before Captain Carson , Sinclair President J. E. Dyer challenged the program 's premise that cheap foreign oil is endangering the nation 's security by cutting down oil exploration . Despite accelerated exploration in recent years , he said , the nation 's reserves are not increasing fast enough . " To disrupt and impair our sources of supply abroad and jeopardize relationships of industry that have been built up with foreign nations over a long period of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any temporary excess of crude-oil imports . " <P> All or None . If Sinclair and the other complainants refuse to go along with the cuts , they will wreck the plan . To date , the six other companies that had been importing heavily for years and whose base-period levels are high have agreed to abide by their quotas . The six ( Atlantic , Gulf , Socony , Standard of California , Jersey Standard , Texas ) , which imported 573,800 bbl. a day in July , plan to cut to 471,000 bbl. by December , 22,000 below the Government 's request . But last week they showed signs of weakening , nervously eyed the appeals for quota boosts . Gulf Executive Vice President David Proctor warned Carson : " Any decision permitting substantial increases in allowable imports based on alleged inequities can only result in a chain reaction .
