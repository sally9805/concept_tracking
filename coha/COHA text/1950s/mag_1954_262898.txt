The Holy Bible , a comfort and a bulwark of doctrine for plain Christians , is a mighty challenge for serious scholars and a treasure trove for cranks . The ordinary layman reads little of the work of either-scholars are all too often unreadable , cranks are generally unpublishable . But when a crank has the reputation and writing ability of Novelist Robert ( I , Claudius ) Graves , publishers are glad to let him run on for page after page . The Nazarene Gospel Restored ( Doubleday ; $10 ) , by Robert Graves and Joshua Podro , published last week , runs on for 982 . <P> The Reassurance . " This book is published , " write the authors , " . . . to reassure the lay public that the original Gospel stood foursquare . . . " But the layman who reads on soon finds that the " original Gospel " according to Graves and Podro is a far cry from the canonical books of the New Testament . The canonical books , " judged by Greek literary standards " say Graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical standards , unreliable ; and their doctrine is confused and contradictory . The late-Victorian atheist ( was it Bradlaugh ? ) may be excused for remarking that they read as though ' concocted by illiterate , half-starved visionaries in some dark corner of a Graeco-Syrian slum . ' " <P> The foursquare Gospel discovered by Graves &; Podro purports to be the Word as it was before the Gentiles began to monkey with it . Jesus , in the Graves-Podro work , was " a man of unusual learning , wit and piety , " a member of a small apocalyptic sect . He was adopted by Mary Magdalene , crowned King of the Jews by John the Baptist at a ceremony that included a ritual mockery and beating . This , according to the authors , is where the mocking and scourging by the soldiers of Pilate really belongs . The Graves-Podro Jesus decided to bring on the Kingdom by his death , and appointed Judas , his " most faithful and perceptive " disciple , to betray him . Taken down from the cross , apparently dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his disciples , saw he had made a mistake , and went off to the " Land of Nod " to start all over again . <P> Paul is the villain of the **27;10427;TOOLONG &-Podro.; A " Greek-speaking adventurer " disguised as a Pharisee , and certainly no Jew , he began his subversion of the Nazarene Church after he had been converted on the road to Damascus-not by a vision but by Jesus ' actual appearance , which literally scared the daylights out of him .
