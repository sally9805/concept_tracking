Is the FRB Throttling the Boom ? <P> THE Federal Reserve Board , as it has often been in the past , was under bitter attack last week . The ruggedly independent agency , which in 1951 was roundly belabored as an " engine of inflation , " was now just as severely criticized as a boom-toppling instrument of deflation , largely because of its credit-tightening action . Amid the growing furor over credit , Texas Representative Wright Patman called for a full-dress congressional investigation to find out if the Federal Reserve has pinched credit too tight . Treasury Secretary George Humphrey , Commerce Secretary Sinclair Weeks and White House Economic Adviser Arthur Burns have all voiced public disapproval of FRB 's fifth boost in the discount rate in a year ( to 3% in two districts ) , although President Eisenhower publicly defended the right of the independent agency to use its own judgment . General Motors ' President Harlow H. Curtice went so far as to blame Detroit 's sliding auto sales on FRB 's credit-crimping policies . On FRB 's side are such experts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRB " was wrong only in not being more vigorous a little sooner , " Harvard Economist Sumner Slichter and retiring New York Federal Reserve Bank President Allan Sproul , who tartly dismisses Automan Curtice 's complaint as " a sort of cosmic jest . " Detroit 's difficulties , says Sproul , are a hangover from 1955 's frantic sales race when too-easy credit skimmed the cream from 1956 's auto market . <P> There is no doubt that credit is tight-and getting tighter . Many banks are turning down loans that they would have gladly accepted last year . Unfortunately , the pinch is harder on small than big businesses . But , as FRB Chairman William McChesney Martin points out , to be effective , credit controls must hurt . <P> FRB argues that there is still enough credit available for the " legitimate " needs of business . As of last week , total reserve bank credit stood at $25.3 billion , some $470 million higher than last year at the same time . With U.S. industry planning an estimated $35 billion record expansion in 1956 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 billion to $27.7 billion v. only a $480 million increase in the same period last year .
