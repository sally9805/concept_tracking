PART TWO I had been in the movies seven years before I discovered the truth of the old saying that there is more to acting than acting . It was about time that I learned what students at dramatic schools learn in their first lesson . In 1932 , thanks to a series of excellent directors , had reached the point where I was to he co-starred with Charles Laughton and Tallulah Bankhcad . Against this talented pair I 'd be lucky to survive the first day of shooting , To complicate matters for me , the picture was a submarine epic called The Devil and the Deep , and , coming from Montana , I knew nothing about submarines . So I studied books about submarines , from the Nautilus of Jules Verne to the latest models in the world 's navies . The way I saw it , a submarine skipper who was surrounded by exploding depth charges would be a lot more tense than the captain of a surface vessel under shellfire . To get the feel of it , I persuaded a naval officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a run-through on how I should handle the controls under attack . We went to the back lot of Paramount , where cutaway sets of a submarine 's vitals had been built . So it was in a full-scale mockup of the control room that Tallulah came upon me one day as I was preparing to " surface . " She saw the strain I was under . " Dahling , " she said , " what in the world arc you doing ? " I came up for air , " Well , if you 're going crash diving with me , " I said , " I thought 1 ought to learn how to drive . " She took a look at all those instruments and ran a gloved hand over a couple to check for dust . " What 's that got to do with acting ? " she asked . " Just this , " I explained . " A fast dive is a tense moment . I push this and pull that , and sort of hold my jaw like this . As the captain says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw . Now , when I head back for the sunshine and fresh air , I feel better . My shoulders relax and my jaw is not so grim , as I pull this and push that . The point is , if I know what I 'm doing , I do n't have to act . But if I just act as if I know , the Navy might catch me in a mistake and laugh me off the screen , " " Baloney , " she said with Bankhead firmness . " If you 've got to be an engineer to be an a -. ? ? a ... = . , . A CURIOUS , CIRCUITOUS TRAIL LED GARY COOPER TO HOLLYWOOD actor , I 'm through . I ca n't even flick a cigarette lighter . " With her talent and voice , Tallulah does n't have to strike a match to warm up an audience , but the rest of us have had to come a long , hard way in making the characters we play ring true . Ever since The Devil and the Deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background material I can get on the character I am to play next . Pretty soon this dusty research begins to get personal . This stuff , as I read it , is happening to mc . Just recently , for instance , I was deep into the court-martial of Gen. Billy Mitchell . I was preparing to play General Mitchell , and every line in the reams of testimony was vital to mc . There was a time when , being a movie actor and only a movie actor , I was beginning to think that the success of a picture depended entirely on the actor and his knowledge of his part . I 'll never forget the scene that snapped me out of that notion . It was in I 9+-1 .. I came to work one day and found myself a producer . I think Nunnally Johnson framed me . Fur an earlier picture called Casanova Brown we had formed a producing unit named International Pictures , Inc . William Goetz was president and his partner , Leo Spitz , was probably the hoard III directors . Nunnally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the title role . The picture gave me very little trouble . In my spare time on the set , I became an expert model-plane pilot . Our next joint effort was a picture based on Alan Le May 's ( Continued on Page 7K ) 78 Well , It Was This Way novel , Useless Cowboy , which , with Nunnally doing the script , came out as Along Came Jones . This time I found myself on the schedule as actor-producer , while Nunnally had nothing to do but doctor his own script . This gave him plenty of time to coach mc on the finer points of being a producer . Nunnally is a Georgia boy . He comes from Columbus , a fair-sized city , but to hear him tell it , he was born so far back in the hills that his ambition in life was to make good so he could move to Tobacco Road . There 's a story that he was five years learning that in the Yankee alphabet the r is not always silent , but once he got the hang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the top producers or directors or writers in Hollywood , or sometimes all three at once . I do n't know why he made me an actor-producer . It began on Producers ' Row of the Goldwyn Studios , where our infant company had rented a sound stage and executive headquarters . To prop up my morale , Don Loper , a top designer , had done over my office in blinding lemon yellows and tomato reds . Bill Goetz gave me the appearance of authority by replacing my cigarette box with a huge cigar humidor . They meant well , I guess . but I felt miscast . On this particular day my ears hurt from listening to the problems of the director , art director , casting director . make-up man . film editor , head nurse , prop man , chief electrician , dressing-room custodian and a dozen others . There was no room on my desk to put my feet . It was piled high with costume designs , lighting diagrams , cost sheets , and expense accounts . Pushed out of sight were memos too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . He said . " Gary . it 's time foh me to give you malt secret fohmula fob bein ' a produsah . It 's jus ' a bitty one . Whencvah a big problem comes up , ' specially if it has anything to do with actahs uh money , jus ' leave it lie , and soonali uh latish it will go ' way . " I ignored him and tried to solve a problem in common sense . If the leading lady was to appear before the cameras in a five-dollar cotton dress , did you buy the cotton dress at the nearest store or did you hire the best stylist in the business to whip up a $175 creation that would look exactly like five bucks ? I hesitated only a moment before calling the stylist . I was learning . That brought me to another problem . The star of this picture was allowed to wear only one gun . and was not supposed to know how to use it . Other cowboy stars in other pictures could wear two guns and use them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress , why could n't Gary Cooper wear two guns ? I was discovering that a motion picture does n't begin and end with the actor . In fact , I was beginning to suspect that with all the work , the confusion and the thousand details that go into producing a picture , the actor was a nuisance and lucky to he allowed on the set . Nunnally brought it all to a head . He said , " Yoh know , proclusali , that actah fellah yoh got wu'kin ' fob ya , name of Coopah ? Well , he was due on the set fifteen minutes ago . Evah time he 's late , yoh lose anothah thousan ' dollahs uh so . If he keeps that up , yoh gon na have to fish him . " I raced out the door , leaped on a bicycle I used to save time , and pedaled for the set . I Iva , not schizophrenic yet , but I could feel it coming on . Maybe I ought to fire me . As I raced through the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling the sky . Great ! Now I could add rain to my worries . With two weeks of ( Continual front Page 2'i ) outdoor shooting scheduled to begin next day , : ain could tie up everything but the expenses . Expenses went on forever . Looking up at the clouds , I did n't see that the street had been closed to traffic . Sonic sound engineer , bothered by noisy trucks , had hung a thin chain across the street , and I whipped into it . And I whipped out of it like a rock out of a slingshot . Witnesses say I flipped right over and landed on the back of my head . The next morning I was still a little groggy , but I got to my office . " Welcome to the ranks , " Nunnally said . " Now you ah a genuine produsah . Thcah all some who say that to be a real produsah yoh gotta. be dropped on yoh haid as a baby , but Ah say , bettah late than nevah . " He helped me into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been swept clean . Even those terrible memos were gone . " Now do yolt see what Ah mean about my fohmula ? " he asked . " When these people think yoh wo n't be aroun ' to solve theah problems , they solve them theahselves . Is that a fohmula or is n't it ? " Well , it is not a formula , but a fine art . There have been times when it has failed even for Nunnally , and he has had to work twenty-four-hour days . He did on Casanova Brown , and on Along Came Jones . Every now and then we kid ourselves into believing our production efforts made us the founders of Universal International Films , Inc. , one of the Hollywood giants . But it was Bill Goetz and Leo Spitz who went on to produce a dozen more successful Idols under the International banner , and with this record they were able to merge with Universal . My experience as a producer did teach me a lot . I learned , for instance , that if every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the success of its filming  --  the physicists , chemists and scientists behind the filming , color and electronic processes ; the location hunters , the transportation men and logistics experts to get the unit to the scene , feed it and nurse it ; the researchers , costume designersand landscape artists ; the lighting experts , specialeffects men , musicians , assistant directors , film cutters and script doctors who wring the last ounce of feeling out of the story ; the bankers who shed a few million in support  --  if all these were added lo the screen credits , along with the producers , directors , musical directors , art directors , actors , writers and others . there would be no footage left for the picture itself . In looking back , I think I am safe in saying that until I met and married Rocky , chance played a bigger part in guiding my career than I did . Unlike most actors , I ca n't say that 1 dreamed of the stage or the movies ever since childhood . And I ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , or beautiful women . When I went to Hollywood in the fall of 1924 , I was just drifting in to sec the folks . Dad had resigned from the Montana Supreme Court , and was in Los Angeles with mother on an estate case for one of his Montana clients . My plan was to enjoy a few days of home cooking before heading for Chicago and art school . It was a chance meeting with friends that led me to my first movie job , and it was chance again that got mc my first big role . A year later , when I awoke one morning to find myself a movie star , I was still not sure I wanted to be one . My acting that first year and for a long time afterward was not of a caliber to be remembered with satisfaction . I lived and worked in an agony of self-consciousness . It was hard to face the fact that when I blew a scene , the retakes made extra work for everybody on the set , It is fine for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed the first time . he should try , try again . but it takes nerve to tell cast , crew and producer to try , try again with him . Other actors had had their rough edges smoothed off in dramatic classes or amateur productions . I was having mine sledge-hammered off in huge painful chunks , right in front of the finest professional talent in Hollywood , Anyone planning to be an artist knows that he must suffer for his art , but I had planned to do my suffering over an easel in the privacy of a garret . I had not planned to be an actor and make a public spectacle of my troubles . There was no acting in my background , nor were there any actors on either side of my family as far back as rte. rinds were kept . In fact , on my father 's side , our branch of the Coopers have been farmers in England for centuries . Two farms near the villages of Tingrith and Houghton Regis in Bedfordshire are still being farmed by Coopers , and mighty fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Brazier family has lived and worked in the shipbuilding town of Gillingham , Kent , for as long as the Coopers have farmed in Becifordlthire . They were , and arc , solid conservative families , not easily disturbed or uprooted . It took Chief Sitting Bull , with help from Chiefs Crazy Horse , Gall and others , to break the pattern . When the Indians killed General Custer and two-hundred-odd soldiers in Montana on June 25 , 1876 , the news made fancy reading in the English papers . A couple of young Englishmen , Walter Cooper and Alfred Brazier , were greatly excited by the dispatches . As soon as they had saved enough money for passage , they sailed for America to become Indian fighters . By the time they arrived , the Indians were somewhat subdued , but the territory of Montana was n't . The hell-roaring mining town of Last Chance Gulch had taken the more dignified name of Helena when it became the territorial capital , but the change had n't affected the habits of the settlers . They were hard-drinking citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad , cattle or wheat  --  take your choice . Uncle Walter , the farmer , picked railroads , and Uncle Alfred , the engineer , picked farming . There is nothing in the family record to show that they knew each other at this time , but with the saloons being the rootin ' , tootin ' places they were , the chances are good that they met . Uncle Walter quickly worked hi way up to the position of locomotive engineer on the Northern Pacific . No job ranked higher , except the territorial governorship or the presidency of the railroad . Certainly a locomotive engineer in Montana stood as high as the duke in Bedfordshire , a fact which Uncle Walter made clear in writing home to his younger brother , Charles . I have been told that my father , Charles , in his youth , was a frail , quiet scholarly lad , not given to rash impulses . There is something wrong with that story . At the age of seventeen , with nothing more to go on than Uncle Walter 's letter , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlay of two shillings sixpence . It took him two years to make it , one bitter winter of which he was stranded in Wisconsin . To get eating money , he took a job selling shoo . About thirty years later , dad and I were back there with a trainload of cattle , and there were farmers around still trying to wear out the shoes he had unloaded on them . I 've acted in a lot of Western stories , but dad lived his . When he arrived in Helena in the summer of 1885 , he was just nineteen years old . Cattle were crowding the last of the buffalo off the prairie . The United States Cavalry was keeping the Indians from going on the warpath . Large-scale silver mining was replacing the every-manfor-h imself gold boom , and range wars were killing nearly as many men as saloon brawls . Dad and a few other dreamers could foresee the day when Montana would become a peaceful , prosperous state , but a lot of law cases would have to be settled first . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer . But first he had to make a living . Uncle Walter got him a job as an engine wiper . He worked in the roundhouse twelve hours a day , six A.M. to six P.SI . That left his mornings and evenings free . So at four A.M. he was running a ' predawn bakery delivery route , and after supper he studied law and shorthand at ( Continued on Page 80 ) ( Continued from Page 78 ) a little business college . On Sundays he solicited new bakery customers . In his spare time he read Shakespeare aloud to gain eloquence for future pleadings in court . As he told it to me , his delivery horse knew more Shakespeare than any other horse in Montana . By the end of the year , the bakery route was paying off so heavily that he could quit the roundhouse . That gave him an extra twelve hours a day for studying law , a little court reporting , the preparation of legal briefs for lawyers , some clerical work for the Supreme Court , a little campaigning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . While dad was doing all this , Uncle Alfred had been busy too . His ranch had prospered to the point where he could get married , and his marriage had prospered to the point where he could use his sister , Alice , to help with the babies . He wrote to England , suggesting that Alice come to Montana . My mother says she had her misgivings about America in general , and especially about her brother 's buildup of Montana . " You know I am the cautious type , " she told me the other day . ( At eighty-one she will still tackle a Los Angeles Freeway in the rush hour , driving her own car . ) " When Alfred asked me to come over , I came , but I had the money for my return fare in myer  --  corset . The minute I got to Helena I put it in a bank . With all those saloons and wild Indians around , I wanted to be sure I could get home . " Poor Alice Brazier ! The bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting panic of 180 nearly every bank in Montana crashed . Her fare back to England was frozen . Then she met the aspiring lawyer named Charles Cooper . He was as prosperous as ever , because he had n't had any money to lose in the first place . All his potential rivals had been wiped out in the crash . He volunteered to do what he could for Miss Brazier , a neighbor from England after all ; and the rest was inevitable . Things were still rough for the Coopers when Arthur was born , in 1895 , but they improved considerably after that . By the time I was born , on May 7 , 1901 , and duly christened Frank Cooper  --  I 'll explain the " Gary " later  --  we were well fixed in a large , two-story brick house that faced Eleventh Avenue and backed against the original Last Chance Gulch . I was a little late for the gold and silver rushes . Gold had been discovered in Last Chance Gulch in I SG4 . By the time I was big enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grain of sand in the creek bed that had n't been washed and pawed over a hundred times . Even the cracks in the bedrock had been probed with knitting needles to bring up the last flakes of gold . Yet after every spring flood we kids could still find enough gold to keep us in licorice and allday-sucker money for a week . When we played cowboys and Indians or vigilantes and outlaws , we acted out real events . Take the time the vigilantes caught up to the Plummer boys . They had just robbed a stage , and this was in the days when Virginia City , Montana , was the toughest town west of the Mississippi . The stagecoach driver told us the story himself , sitting on a bench down by the railroad station : " There was maybe a dozen of ' cm . Two on horseback in front . The rest hunched up behind rocks on the hill . Masked , they was . Black masks . ' Throw up your hands , ' they says . Dorn fools . If I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' scattered like prairie chickens . " And then he would tell how he shot down four men and rode down the two horsemen blocking the road . We did n't miss a word . We would get conflicting stories of the same holdup from other eyewitnesses and genuine vigilantes , but we never minded that . It was enough that we got our yarns straight from the men who had been there . Besides , if they all told the same story , we 'd have nothing to argue about . Saturday afternoon , when the ranchers , miners and cowboys drifted into town , could be pretty exciting too . Most of the kids in our neighborhood were forbidden to go downtown at such times . But we must have cheated a little , because I can remember saloon doors bursting open , men rolling out into the street and horses running away . I remember , too , that the Indians enjoyed the uproar . ? All of this was fine for Arthur and me , but it worried our mother . In her mind , the properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eton collar , carefully supervised by an English schoolmaster . Arthur and I were running wild in the mountains behind town . We wore overalls , denim shirts and high shoes " guaranteed to be protected against barnyard rot . " Instead of playing cricket and collecting butterflies , we played cowboy-and-Indian games , and hunted for gold , arrowheads , wolf dens and jack rabbits . And we pitched into the food at dinnertime in a way that shocked our mother . She would cry out , " Your manners ! " and we would try to use knife and fork in the English fashion , but it was no use . The way we saw it , style prevented the rapid consumption of vit des . Except in the matter of raising her boys , mother took to die American way of fife , Helena must have struck her as raw and crude at first , but she came to glory in its very newness . She took all the women 's magazines , favored New York 's fashions over London 's , and picked up each new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were supposed to know nothing of such mysterious things as photography and chemistry , but mother became an expert photographer . She had an elaborate darkroom in the cellar . If I am any good at posing for cameramen , it is because I can still hear mother saying , " For goodness ' sakes , will you please stop wiggling ? This is a time exposure . " During these first years of my life , dad continued working at a hard pace . At times his law practice was such that we would see him only briefly at meals . He would be in his study going over his lawbooks when I went to bed at night , and he would be back at it before I got up in the morning . Business was so good at one point that he and James Sanders , son of Col. Wilbur Sanders , territorial governor of Montana , became partners . Then it became so bad that he had to give up his practice and become legal secretary fur Gov . Preston H. Leslie . He often made ends meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State Supreme Court . I 've heard he was one of the fastest court reporters in the West , but it soured him on long-winded jurists and lawyers . When he came to sit on the bench of the Montana Supreme Court , he handed down decisions which were masterpieces of brevity . He drove himself day and night , through good times and bad . While his dreams of bringing law and order to the West were coming true , he also saw to it that Arthur and 1 caught some of the spirit of those dreams . If any explanation is needed for why I like to make Western pictures , there it is . Although dad was born an Englishman , he was a true Westerner . And I take after him . By the time I was nine , the family fortune had improved , but Arthur and I had not . To our mother . we were but one step removed from wild Indians . For one thing , I must have been exposed to a swear word or two , and in a careless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother heard it and washed out my mouth with soap . I was still spitting bubbles when dad got home . " It 's the last straw , " said mother . " When I think of those dear little lads in England , all so neat and polite , and I look at our  --  our savages ! Well , it 's high time we took them back to England for a toning down We ca n't wait another day . That 's all there . is to it . " If dad had any objection , he did n't speak up . By this time he was one of the best trial lawyers in Montana , with an eloquence that could hypnotize juries , but I guess he realized the evidence was on mother 's side . We went to England , leaving dad behind .
