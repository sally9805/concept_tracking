A Midwestern Representative made a unique investigation , to find out whether high tariffs would help or hurt his voters . The results will startle a lot of business executives , labor leaders , and Congressmen . A FEW months ago a freshman Republican Congressman from Indiana decided to try to find out what , if any , effect foreign trade has on his District . From the day he arrived in Washington for the opening of the 83rd Congress , D. Bailey Merrill of Evansville had been buffeted by pleas of free traders on one hand and high-tariff advocates on the other . Lobbyists representing every point of view had begun knocking on his door almost before he could take-his oath of office . After some weeks of this , and after listening to the impassioned debate on extension of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act , Merrill appealed to the Library of Congress . Two staff men from the Library 's Legislative Reference Service ? Howard S. Piquet and-Harold T. Lamar ? were assigned to his project . As a result , we now have a detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly typical Midwestern constituency . It is the only comprehensive study of its kind and it will be invaluable when the great national debate on trade policy erupts affa in after the Randall Commission makes 0 its recommendations for a new foreign economic policy . The seventeen-man Randall Commission has been wrestling with trade and currency issues since last fall and has already held debates throughout the country . But these have been mostly between people speaking either purely theoretically or on the basis of only their own personal business experience . The Merrill study is something else . The Eighth Indiana , the subject of the study , is an eleven-county district of 393,000 people in the southernmost part of the state . It has 225,000 city dwellers and a rural population of 168,000 . Like almost any other area in the country , it has among these people determined free traders and stubborn protectionists . A leading furniture manufacturer in the district , for exam pie , recently argued for a high tariff wall against all countries except those " that are founded on a true and absolute democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguing for low tariffs , replied that trade with all nations should he on an equal basis . " When one nation is out of balance in relation to the others , " he said , " the people suffer . " Both Indiana 's Senators ? Republicans Homer E. Capehart and William E. Jennerare conservative protectionists of the old school . But Congressman Merrill 's study shows clearly that if they were successful in erecting a high tariff wall around the United States , there would be immediate unemployment on the farms and in the factories of the Eighth District of Indiana . In fact , a severe depression could easily follow . The Farmer 's Stake T AKE agriculture first . Almost one-fifth of the District 's population lives on farms , and 12 per cent of the labor force works on them . The farmers produced corn , soybeans , tobacco , . and other field crops that were worth $15,169,000 in 1949 , the last year for which detailed statistics arc available . Livestock production the same year brought them $31,420,000 . Most of the major agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - the Library of Congress report said . " Such products as corn , small grains ( including wheat , oats , barley , and rye ) , soybeans , tobacco , milk and cream , eggs , and hogs not only account for the major portion of the District 's agricultural production , but are among the most important agricultural commodities exported by the United States . " The District 's wheat crop in 1949 brought 52,780,000 ? and 33.5 per cent of all United States wheat produced in 1949 was exported . Soybean production brought District farmers $3,013,000 in 1949 ? and 25.1 per cent of the nation 's soybean production was sold overseas . Eighth District farmers produced $954,000 worth of tobacco in 1949 ? and 25.1 per cent of the United States tobacco production was exported . The corn crop in the District was worth $5,272,000 ? and 3.5 per cent of the nation 's corn was exported . ( Actually , a much larger percentage of the corn found its way abroad in the form of meat products , for most corn is fed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures on dairy exports because of inadequate statistics . While most of the District 's dairy products were undoubtedly sold locally , in 1949-51 more than halt the dried whole milk produced in this country was exported , as were 13.5 per cent of the condensed milk , 7.1 per cent of the evaporated milk , and 6.3 per cent of the cheese . So it is clear that District dairymen too have a stake in foreign trade . Sodo the bog producers , who took in $10,680,000 in 1949 . Their precise stake is also uncertain because of inadequate statistics , but one per cent of the pork and 22 per cent of the lard produced by American farmers are sold abroad . Egg production brought Eighth District farmers $3,526,000 in 1949 ? and 2.7 per cent of domestic egg production was exported . The effect of foreign trade on District minerals is not so clear as it is on agriculture . About 3,300 men in the District ( 2 per cent of the labor force ) are employed in the production of minerals ; two-thirds of them in coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bituminous annually at a time when 10 per cent of America 's soft coal has been exported . Petroleum production brings about $15 , - 000,000 annually to the District . Coal and oil producers elsewhere in the country have complained bitterly that they are subjected to severe competition from imports of crude and fuel oil . The Library of Congress study found , however , that the Eighth District is not materially affected either by exports or imports of coal and oil , and it concluded that on balance producers seem to share to a greater extent in coal exports than in the competitive impact of fuel oil . Jobs for Factory Workers ANUFACTURING is the most important economic activity in the Eighth District . The value of manufactures in 1947 , when the last Census of Manufactures was taken , was about $250,000,000 . The following table shows the 1950 breakdown of employment . Evansville , the largest city in the District , is the world 's largest refrigeration center . The significant fact for this industry is that 13 per cent of all refrigerators produced in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Evansville , which employs more than 10,000 refrigerator workers , reported that every type of refrigeration equipment it manufactures is exported . FURNITURE and lumber producers export some of their products , but of the four District companies that expressed concern over imports , three were in this field . ( The fourth , a small cement manufacturer , said he had had trouble from import competition before World War II but none since . ) The three lumber and furniture men said that competition is not serious now , but they were worried about the future . One of them , a manufacturer of single-ply face veneers , said imports " will eventually become serious . " Another , a manufacturer of fancy veneer , said he faced the possibility of competition from imported mahogany veneers ; and the third , a plywood manufacturer , said imports of thin plywood , while not directly competitive with his product , had forced some other thin plywood manufacturers " to go after our customers for relief . " In the food products field , the Mead Johnson Company , which employs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritious foods , reported that at least 10 per cent of its sales are for export . The 3,073 auto workers , chiefly in assembly plants of Chrysler , Briggs Manufacturing Company , and the Hercules Body Corporation , know that about 5 per cent of American passenger cars arc exported . Also in this group are farm-machinery manufacturers , 12 per cent of whose output is exported . The Bucyrus-Eric Company of Evansville , manufacturers of road-building and heavy construction equipment , reported that between 40 and 50 per cent of its production is for export . In chemicals , the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company plant in Clarksville reported that they counted little on exports , but depended heavily on the import of such items as coconut oil , palm oil , olive oil , talcum , and crude glycerine . A leading wholesale druggist in the District explained that though he does not import directly , he sells imported merchandise . " We feel quite strongly , " he added ; " on the free trade side of the question . " " Among the products manufactured in the District , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances where imports are injurious to domestic producers . " Or , if there are , the Library team was unable to find them . On the contrary , it found " other manufacturers in the District . who , while not producing directly for export markets , are vitally affected by exports . For example , the expansion of the refrigeration industry has influenced the growth of a number of metalworking industries in Evansville , including metal stamping and fabricating plants , furnishing parts and fittings for refrigerator cabinets , along with a variety of other metal parts and supplies for other kinds of manufacturing and assembly plants . . . . Such establishments as railway companies , motor transport concerns , warehouses , banks , and insurance companies all profit from foreign trade . Several hundred in nonmanufacLuring enterprises are directly dependent upon foreign trade for their livelihood . These include railroad engineers , brakemen , switchmen , and mechanics , truck drivers , office workers , and warehouse employees . " Fads vs . Prejudice iXPANSION of foreign trade would inevitably mean " increased development and economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers concluded . By the same token , contraction of foreign trade would mean the reverse . It would not only injure those industries that depend upon exports , it would fail to give substantial aid to the few producers who want protection ? for some of these are high-cost manufacturers who suffer as much from more efficient domestic industries in related fields as they do from foreign competition . Moreover , more workers in the Eighth District are employed in the manufacture of refrigeration products alone than in all the industries that might benefit from tariff protection together. * If there were layoffs in the refrigerator , automobile , and construction-machinery industries , and lower farm prices , as a. result of the loss of export markets , the *There are 13,000 refrigerator workers and 12,000 workers in the coal mines , the oil fields , and the furniture and lumber industries . consumption of coal , oil , and gas would be cut . Perhaps the most significant thing about the Eighth District study is its substantial refutation of the popular argument that only the mammoth corporations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industries in the Eighth District that are dependent upon exports for their margin of profit are small companies . The consumer 's interest was not considered in the study , but he is the one who should benefit most from competitive international trade . Neither was the security interest of the United States . But the expansion of the market For American industry means a consequent increase in the economic and military strength of the nation . The interests of our allies were not considered , but the development of the widest possible area of economic freedom clearly would strengthen the nations on whom we must rely in any future conflict . Another study somewhat similar to this one but on a less intensive scale was completed a short time ago in the Eighteenth District of Pennsylvania . The Pennsylvania study , conducted by the United States Council of the International Chamber of Commerce , was an attempt to find out whether Representative Richard M. Simpson . ( R ) , the Eighteenth District Congressman , actually was representing the best interests of his constituents in his crusade for protectionism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had his way , he would do his District more harm than good . ANY detailed studies like these are needed to fortify Senators and Representatives against the special pleas of producers who want protection without regard to the effect on the community as a whole . During the recent Congressional recess Representative Merrill continued his study , interviewing scores of persons and double-checking the experts ' findings . Now he is convinced that a " mutually profitable world commerce is essential for world peace " and for the welfare of the Eighth District . Unlike many of his fellow Congressmen , he is able to speak on the basis of knowledge rather than from prejudice or what might have been true half a century ago . I Am a British manufacturer of high-fidelity equipment . For several years I have been marketing it quite successfully in the United States ? and 1 think I have learned something about the important art of selling things to Americans . This task is not so mysterious and difficult as many Europeans assume it is . Ever since the postwar sellers ' market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale of consumer goods to the United States . Because it is difficult for anyone to recognize , admit , and rectify his own shortcomings , we British have been seeking eagerly for some other explanation . Our favorite excuse is the American tariff . When Sir Winston Churchill argued for " trade not aid , " he said that such a goal would be almost impossible to reach , if U. S. import duties made the sale of British goods very difficult . This plea for a reduction in American tariffs has been taken up enthusiastically by British newspapers , industrial magnates , and others who are trying to find some outside reason for Britain 's difficulties . I can not align myself with this point of view . Indeed , I am opposed to it . I believe that the real cause for the export decline is to be found inside Britain . Unless this cause is removed , reduction of U. S. tariffs can oniy subsidize an unhealthy state of affairs , postpone the application of the correct remedial measures , and hinder Britain 's return to sanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not restore British prosperity ; it can only help by being reasonable , and American tariffs are not unreasonable ? indeed I find them much more favorable to me , a manufacturer , than those of any other country with which I trade . What Americans Want HE whole problem can be summed up in a few words : the British products which sell in the United States sell because they are the sort of thing Americans want ; those that do n't sell are those which Americans do n't want . There are , of course , qualifying factors . For example , a certain high-quality British raincoat , reasonably priced , could not be sold in America because of a defect in the description submitted to the customs authorities . On the specification submitted , duties were applied which made sales impossible , and the coats were shipped back to England ? simply because , through inadvertence and the wrong use of language , the description was inaccurate by American usage . Other raincoat manufacturers took the trouble to determine the conditions beforehand , had their goods assessed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . When all is said and done , no country is under any obligation to make the way easier for foreigners . Yet my own experience has been that the American Embassy in London will go out of its way to explain to British manufacturers the best way of exporting to the United States . It is a common failing of manufacturers to assume that their product is such a wonderful job of work it must sell on its merits . They do not put themselves in the position of the buyer . I have been told many times that basically Americans like British products , but often there is something wrong with the price , the service , or the suitability , which makes them a poor buy . Many British products sell well in America because they meet the needs of the market . Scotch whisky sells because it is Scotch ? a distinctive product unlike any other . British tweeds and woollens sell because they are of exceptional quality ; British bicycles , because they give a performance quite different from that of their American counterparts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myown products sell because the people who buy them maintain that they give the best results for the price . It would be impossible to sell America some British products , even if there were no import duties . British radios and TV sets , for example , are designed for a completely different set of market conditions . By the same token American TV sets are unsalable in Britain . But there are other important British industries which have lost the United States market they once had , and it is when these substantial dollar returns to Britain disappear that the politicians begin to get worried . N o BETTER illustration could be picked than ate British automobile industry . It has been said that if the U. S. import duty on cars were reduced by only 5 per cent all the lost ground could be regained . Yet in Canada , where the duty on British cars is only half that on American , the price is still too high for the market . To complete the superficial picture , the president of the Austin Motor Company said some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of selling his cars in the United States . How easy , then , for the politician not skilled in industrial economics to assume that if this important British industry is content to forgo profits for the sake of earning dollars . and still can not sell in America because the price is too high , the reason must be that tariffs make sales impossible . This assumption is false . The British automobile industry was a good dollar earner in the immediate postwar period . It is highly mechanized , has many millions of invested capital , employs large numbers of skilled workers , has world-wide sales organizations and a background of good will earned by making a satisfactory article at a reasonable price . Nevertheless it is losing not only its American market but other overseas markets as well ? because its merchandise does not compare favorably with that made in Detroit , Germany , France , and Italy . There is a very good reason for this , and it is not entirely the fault of the manufacturers ; but it is clearly impossible to blame U. S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Switzerland does not even make automobiles . In the first place , British productivity is far behind that of the United States . In part this is due to exhaustion after fighting a very tough war . More particularly it is due to the arrival of the so-called welfare state . It is not my purpose to criticize the system chosen by the majority of the people in Britain ? but having chosen it they are now suffering from its consequences . With more pay for less work , the working man may now be enjoying a fuller life than he used to , and he has every right to a fuller life ; but if he is not prepared to produce more , by greater working efficiency than in the old days , the cost of production is bound to rise . Every " working party " sent to the United States to examine production has returned to report that . Britain is outstripped in production efficiency . When Any Old Thing Would Sell M OREOVER , one of the greatest setbacks to the the automobile industry was the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Britain 's prime need was foreign currency . No manufacturer can exist on export trade alone . His greatest natural market is his home market , and the more sales he makes at home , the better can he compete overseas , for big production means efficient production . The car manufacturer was therefore working in an artificial and uneconomical atmosphere . So ridiculous did conditions become that potential domestic customers were quoted waits up to fifteen years for delivery of a new car . A sellers ' market like this is liable to create arrogance in the supplier , and result in lack of attention to design and quality . Any old thing can sell ; any old thing did sell , so long as demand outstripped supply . But when Detroit returned to normal production the British car was caught out on a limb . It not only was inferior in quality ; it was not the sort of car the American road user wanted . In more normal times , the manufacturer designed primarily for the home market . The outcome was the characteristic small-powered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fussiness " was not of serious importance , for the British road system is a genuine antique , developed from an ancient system of tracks , on which high speed is almost impossible . The average British family motorist was content to drift along atabout 35 miles per hour , and this economical car suited him well enough . Apart , therefore , from the handicap of lower production efficiency , the British car manufacturer was producing a piece of merchandise designed for a type of road that did n't exist elsewhere . Certainly much money was spent advertising the small-car idea , but it was quite obvious that the American buyer was not seriously impressed . The only exception appears to be the miniature sports car , much sought after by the younger generation as a rather amusing toy . The ordinary American , however , wants something that is fast , has good acceleration , is comfortable over long distances , requires little servicing ( and when it does , can be serviced anywhere ) , and does n't cost too much . If the British automobile manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market is assured . If he ca n't , then abolition of import duties will not help him , for he has the wrong product . The Right Product Y OWN experience indicates what can be done with the right product . My customers are people who like music and want to recreate it in their homes . Music is one of those precious things that transcend nationality and frontiers , so what I make for the British market is suitable for any market ? provided that I can offer something as good as what is available elsewhere . In the British market I found that expansion was becoming impossible ? and my sales were in fact contracting ? because the type of customer who came to me was being strangled by excessive taxation . ( The more intellectual professional classes in a welfare state do n't have much welfare , for they do not have the bargaining power of trade unions nor the toughness of financial tycoons . ) I felt the time had come to expand my export program and I selected the United States as the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of merchandise had never been exported to America before . Now the mere fact that a manufacturer has sold his products successfully at home is no guarantee he will do the same abroad . The good will he may have built up has no value in another country , which has n't heard of him or the things he makes . The product stands or falls on performance and suitability .. I felt that my products were well designed and well made , and did what was expected of them in a better way thin my competitors ' , but for all I knew American music-lovers might have other ideas . Before I spent a single dollar on advertising , I took a year to find out just what the American high-fidelity enthusiast wanted . Y SUCCESS had been founded on the principle that the best . reproducing equipment required something more t Ian technical skill . After the best speaker has been designed mathematically , it still may not sound musical , for music can not be broken down into mathematical equations . The speaker must be craftsman-built and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me the sort of sales argu-ment that might have a chance in the U. S. My company was a small craftsman type of outfit with limited production , but that production was conscientiously carried out in a very careful way . Being a small organization , I could not compete in advertising space ; the cost would be far beyond my means . I had no agents in America , no distribution , no servicing facilities , and I knew nothing about the mechanics of exporting to the United States . I also had no desire to leave my welfare in the hands of one importing agent . Four months of discreet and careful advertising produced the first order . Within eighteen months I had found nearly two thousand customers who sent their money to London , taking a chance that what I said in my ads was true . All but three of them wrote later that they were well pleased with what I had sent them . The American Embassy in London told me about the routine of importing , what the import duties were , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , the United States wants other countries to be self-supporting , and also wants to buy the sort of goods it wants , and anything they can do to further these objectives is available to me or to anyone else who seeks it . My success did not go unnoticed by other British manufacturers , and I was asked how I did it . I explained there was no difficulty : the only questions were , did the product meet the needs of the American buyer , and was the price right ? If the answers were " Yes , " success was certain . What about import duties ? I replied that as British wages were lower than American , it did n't seem to matter . in my case , the rate was 133/4 per cent , whereas the British preferential rate into Canada was 15 per cent and then a manufacturer 's tax was applied not only to the cost of the article but to the import duty as well . From experience of what it cost to ship my speakers to the United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $57.50 . Equivalent prices in other countries varied according to the import duties and local taxes applied to the product . Typical figures were : Great Britain $58.50 , Canada $62.50 . South Africa $67.20 , Switzerland $69.00 , Australia and New Zealand well over $70.00 , when it was possible to get an import license , which was n't often . Where New Ideas Come From 1 T is the activities of large corporations that make news ; what the small manufacturer does arouses little interest and has no political implications . Yet small manufacturers contribute 70 per cent of Britain 's industrial output . British original thought and design are still second to none , but only the small manufacturer can get a new idea on the market quickly ; the large corporations move too slowly , and only move at all when substantial quantities arc involved . If large plants can not compete . with their American counterparts , it is plain common sense to give every encouragement to small firms who can . The tragedy is that this is not being done . Until it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution to international economy . Recently I myself have been almost forced out of business because I can no longer get steel for my speakers . It has all been taken by big industries . Yet while steel was rationed , and I got my fair share , I was bringing in a dollar return fifteen times as great as automobiles for every ton of steel used . The possible loss of my American market ? and of dollars to Britain ? has nothing whatever to do with the American tariff .
