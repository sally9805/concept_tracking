The bird-loving National Audubon Society began its week with happiness ; one of its prospectors had discovered a large flock of flamingos in Yucatan . A few days later , the happiness turned to ecstasy when gladder news arrived from Texas . At Aransas National Wildlife Refuge near Corpus Christi , the message said , a precious egg had been hatched . From it had stepped a baby whooping crane , the first ever born in captivity . Thus , according to the most respected count , there were 38 , not 37 , survivors of the once numerous breed of whooping cranes . <P> Few births have had more careful attention than . the event among the cranes last week . Whooping cranes normally migrate from the Gulf Coast to unknown breeding grounds in Canada , but Crip and Josephine , the parents of Little 38 , had been grounded by wing injuries . Last fall they were brought together by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and given the run of 150 acres of well-fenced Texas marsh . It was not certain that they would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of their names , that they were male &; female . <P> From an observation tower , the Wildlifers watched the pair through telescopes . Yes , they assured one another hopefully , there was interest stirring . The great birds had been noted prancing a little and tossing their black-tipped wings in the air in the courtship minuet of the whooping cranes . The Wildlifers smiled like doting parents and waited . <P> When one of the great birds , probably Josephine , laid a large , brown-speckled egg , the tension outside the fence neared the bursting point . Wildlifers tramped the marsh , guarding against such raiders as egg-sucking raccoons . Unauthorized visitors were kept at a distance while the cranes took turns on the nest , one of them caring for the egg while the other strode off for food . <P> At last the great day came . With thumping hearts the telescope watchers kept the nest under minute-to-minute watch . Had the precious egg brought forth a fuzzy nestling ? Yes , it was true . Two days later . Little 38 was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> This week , the rejoicing turned to gloom . One of the world 's best-guarded babies had disappeared . Bird-lovers feared that Little 38 had become a victim of some marauding animal .
