It shall be unlawful for any person of the Caucasian or white race to intermarry with any person of the Ethiopian or black race , Malayan or brown race , or Mongolian or yellow race . . . <P> - 1864 Nevada Law <P> Harry Bridges , Australian-born West Coast longshore boss , flew into Reno from San Francisco last week with his companion and registered at the Mapes Hotel as " Mr. &; Mrs. Harry Bridges " - prematurely , as it turned out . For one thing , it was too late in the day for even a quick Nevada wedding . For another , as besieging newspapermen pointed out when Bridges jauntily introduced them to his bride-to-be next morning , the archaic , unchallenged Nevada law forbade it . The future and third Mrs. Bridges , 35-year-old Noriko Sawada , a dainty , dignified San Francisco law secretary , is a Nisei . <P> Bridges , 57 , never one to duck a fight , attempted three times the next day to get a marriage license and was rebuffed . " She is n't really a Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was born in the United States . " Replied Clerk Viola Given : " It is n't where you were born , but your bloodstream that counts . " The couple re-registered for separate rooms at the hotel . On the third day U.S. District Judge Taylor Wines , on a petition filed by Bridges , gave his ruling : " The right to marry is the right of the individual , not the race . . . If we are to take the proposition that all men are born free and equal seriously , then we ca n't very well ignore the implications . " After a brief wedding a few minutes later , Bridges allowed cordially : " You ca n't hold a law that was established way back around 1860 against the people of today . "
