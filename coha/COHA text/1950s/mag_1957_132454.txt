LAMENT FOR NEW YORK // This has been the bitterest season in New York 's baseball history . Almost in one breath , the metropolis has lost its two National League clubs and the World Championship . // The first blow is heavier than the second ; it is a disgrace that New York next year will be unable to see half of the greatest stars in the national game . Mayor Wagner is making noises about bringing some other National League franchise to the city , but nothing in his previous handling of the situation leads us to think that these amount to more than empty phrases . // New York fans who are also baseball lovers will freely recognize that the game benefits from the extension of the major leagues to California . They will be pardoned , though , for feeling this hardly compensates for their own bereavement . It is a sad situation which has been brought about by a combination of sophistication on the part of New Yorkers who have so many amusements from which to choose , of transportation and parking difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall . // The Yankees ' loss of the World Championship caps this humiliation . Here again many New York fans will join others across the country in feeling that Milwaukee 's triumph is good for baseball . Yet , there is a tribute which needs to be paid to the Yankees . // Stengel 's was not a great ball club , certainly not as good as some of the previous Yankee teams which built up the legend of invincibility this one came so close to sustaining . But it was a well-drilled club which exuded class . It had class in defeat . It even exuded class in the final Series game , when it committed all those errors , of which only three were officially charged . // To Casey Stengel bitter defeat comes in his 67th year  --  at an age when he can not hope to compete in many more World Series . Perhaps , in defeat , this man is etched more sharply in our minds than ever before . He has been cheered and booed and laughed at and second-guessed across the length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great game 's great personalities . // WHODUNIT // Superlatives are in order for the Notre Dame-Army game at Municipal Stadium , Philadelphia last Saturday . College football is not likely to produce a more thrilling game all year ( see page 18 ) ; oldtimers at Notre Dame-Army games could hardly recall a better , closer , more dramatic encounter between the two schools since it all started in 1913 . To such agreeable matters of congratulation , SPORTS ILLUSTRATED must add a note for the record : The host team ( Army ) failed to provide play-by-play information over the public-address system , so that most of the 95,000 in the cavernous stands  --  unlike the TV audience-must have had to wait for their Sunday newspapers to learn just who did what . // The game was 2 ? minutes old , for example , when an Army back ran 81 yards for a touchdown  --  but unless you had 20/20 vision and could read his number ( 21 ) as he ran , and then refer to your program , it was very possibly Sunday before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-year man from Cocoa , Fla . And so it went . It was Nick Pietrosante of Ansonia , Conn. who gained most of those yards for the Irish , ladies and gentlemen , and it was Monty Stickles , a sophomore from Poughkeepsie , who won the game for Notre Dame with that 28-yard field goal  --  just a few minutes after the same Monty Stickles had apparently kicked the game away by missing a point-after-touchdown. // Ah , well , there has n't been a better argument all year for staying home and watching the game on television . // A DAY FOR WILLIE // Willie Shoemaker had the two best horses in America at his disposal last week , but he had to make a choice . He could stay at Belmont and ride Gallant Man in the $75,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup or fly to Chicago and ride Round Table in the $100,000 Hawthorne Gold Cup . // It was a dilemma new to Willie because , since last June , Gallant Man and Round Table have never run on the same day  --  and Willie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse , capturing more than half a million dollars ' worth of stakes races . Gritting his teeth , Willie decided to stay East and ride Gallant Man , and the choice did n't turn out badly at all . For one thing , he rode Gallant Man to victory in the Gold Cup ; for another , Mrs. Elizabeth Arden Graham asked him to ride Jewel 's Reward in the $156,500 Champagne Stakes on the same day 's card  --  and Willie won that too . It was the richest day of racing in the history of New York State , and Shoemaker had earned himself $13,807 . " I guess , " he said quietly , " this was the greatest day I 've ever had . " // The victory of Jewel 's Reward made it a great day for Mrs. Graham , too . Twice she had gambled with this horse , and twice won . She tried to dispose of him in the Saratoga Yearling Sales in 1956 , but when the bidding reached only $3,500 she used her reserved bid and kept the horse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in the Champagne at the cost of a $7,500 supplementary fee . She has now won $234,295 with the colt , who needs only $40,000 more to become the richest 2-year-old in the history of American racing . She has almost trained the horse herself , putting scoopfuls of patience into him in Chicago and New York and supervising him all along . // Out in Chicago , meanwhile , in the race that Willie did n't ride , the Hawthorne Gold Cup was won by Round Table in track-record time  --  adding more fuel to the conviction of Californians and others that it is Round Table who deserves the title of Horse of the Year . // While the racing house stands divided , Willie Shoemaker has apparently made up his mind . He seems to prefer Gallant Man and expects to ride him in the Washington , D.C. International on November 11 against the best horses in the world , including Round Table . The West Coast , which has the Dodgers , the Giants and Round Table wo n't like it , but like any good shoemaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'CLOCK TEE // Porky Oliver and Julius Boros appeared on eastern television screens last Saturday afternoon at 4 , playing golf . Oliver won , with a 62 to Boros ' 68 . An hour later the same match was televised in the Central time zone , and so on westward to the Pacific . Thus it reached most viewers at exactly the same hour  --  4 p.m . The match was on film , of course , and was actually played last November at the Phoenix ( Arizona ) Country Club . It was the first of 26 hour-long golf shows which ABC will broadcast on Saturday afternoons this winter . This Saturday Oliver will be challenged by Mike Souchak . As on certain quiz shows , the winner keeps playing as long as he wins . // All-Star Golf is the invention of Peter DeMet , the Chicago Pontiac dealer who first discovered that televised bowling matches have an almost hypnotic fascination for viewers . ( Watching one more strike is irresistible , like eating one more peanut . ) The contestants will include many top pros : Cary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furgol , et al . The matches were actually played out in order , on sunny southwestern courses ( for easy filming ) , and were played as nearly as possible under USGA rules . // There were certain exceptions , though . Setting up the cameras for each new hole made a round last some six hours instead of three , so the players were allowed to take practice shots while waiting on the camera crews . Also , for the convenience of the living-room viewer , a player keeps putting until he holes out instead of following the rule whereby the player farthest away from the cup hits first . // Each week the winner gets $2,000 and the chance to win again the following week ; the loser gets $1,000 and is eliminated . Anyone who scores an eagle gets an extra $500 , and the man who makes a hole-in-one will find his golf ball resting in a cup at the foot of the rainbow  --  the hole-in-one prize is $10,000. // All-Star Golf hopes to attract plenty of nongolfing viewers as well as the 5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end each shot is explained with care , and the announcer sometimes discourses briefly on the rules of the game . // There is also the matter of suspense . Will Porky Oliver fend off Mike Souchak on Saturday , win another $2,000 and go on to greater glory ? Well , naturally the question has already been answered , since the match was filmed months ago . But the answer is classified top secret , and only a few insiders know . The rest of us will have to tune in to find out . // TWO-WHEEL TOURIST // Joe Young , a 27-year-old resident of Salt Lake City , has a red beard , a wife , three small children and a Lambretta motor scooter . One day not long ago , he kissed his wife and children goodby , boarded his motor scooter and drove the 5,000 miles to New York City and back , collecting insects in his ginger beard as he went , the way a Ford does in its radiator . Why did Joe Young do this ? Well , he is a disc jockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the way he phoned back bulletins to his public and these were recorded and played on his programs . // The trip was planned for two weeks , but took three . Not that the Lambretta was slow : ordinary motorists were astonished to see the little contraption shooting along a highway at 55 mph . ( " That 's its top speed , " says Young , " unless you 're going downhill . " ) The best day 's run was 506 miles , the worst 130 . In Cleveland , on the return trip , both Young and his scooter found themselves performing sluggishly : the Lambretta was clogged with carbon and Joe had the flu . But after two days both were fit again and on the road . // As a pioneer in long-distance motor scooter travel , Joe Young made a number of observations which will be useful to those who may follow in his wheel tracks . Here they are : // 1 ) In tunnels never ride the middle of the lane ; ride the tire tracks , for the center is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around trucks . The whiplash of the wind they create can move you sideways as much as three feet , possibly into oncoming traffic . // 3 ) Never drive at night in Iowa . ( " There are no drivers in Iowa willing to dim their headlights . " ) // 4 ) Be careful at railroad crossings in Ohio . They are bumpier there than anywhere else . // 5 ) Beware of large rocks , oil slicks and chuck holes , any one of which can throw you . // 6 ) Wear a crash helmet . // 7 ) Heed the " reduce speed " signs around small towns in the East . They may herald a cobblestone street , which is poison to a fast-traveling scooter. // 8 ) Stay off turnpikes in fog and at night . A huge truck  --  with the driver so high and you so low  --  could run right over you without the driver 's ever seeing you . ( Toll collectors and highway patrolmen may ban a motor scooter from a turnpike anyway , unwilling to believe that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a comfortable place . Do n't plan to sleep out along the highway . You need a comfortable bed to get the kinks out . // Yet , apparently , the kinks were not too severe . The day after he got back home , Young said he 'd be willing to do it again some time  --  " if I could just take a little more time . " // It seems odd that Young put up with the nuisance of combing insects out of his beard in the interest of economy , but this is the case , and it works out this way : motor scooters are strongly affected by the wind , so most of the time Young drove without the scooter 's plastic windscreen in order to lessen wind resistance . This arrangement permitted the bombardment of grasshoppers , gnats and dragon flies , but it also allowed him to get 100 miles to the gallon . // SONGS FOR A BEAR // Americans have catalogued the tricks-of wilderness survival in letters , novels , handbooks , manuals , ballroom lectures and campfire talks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day Major Howard Martin , 47 , a retired Army officer , was able to add a completely new and novel directive to the long , long list : " If treed by a grizzly bear  --  sing ! " The major and his grizzly , a large and ill-tempered female , encountered each other in the Montana wilderness near the little town of Swan Lake . The major , who was out hunting blue grouse with his dog Nig , had a limit of three birds and not a care in the world at the moment of contact , but the bear , who was apparently out hunting a lost cub , was in a much less satisfied mood . // As soon as she spotted the major , in fact , it became obvious that she blamed him for all her troubles . Her hackles rose . She growled . She charged . Since she was only 60 feet away the major had to climb fast , and there was nothing to climb but two small Engelmann 's spruce  --  trees which were but six inches through the base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He dropped his .22 rifle and scrambled into one , while Nig bought him a few seconds ' time by barking at the monster . Then the bear rose , swung at him , missed by six inches , and tore all the lower bark and branches off his sanctuary . Martin hopped to the next tree , putting himself 10 inches out of the bear 's reach , and there he stayed for 16 hours . // The major was treed at about 4:30 in the afternoon . Nig the dog stayed nearby , barking at the bear until 5:30 , and then discreetly trotted home . The bear glared up at Martin and Martin glared down at the bear . Every time he shifted his cramped limbs the bear rose to her hind legs and swung . After one near miss he was moved to protest . " Hey , " he told the bear , " stop it . " // " I noticed right off , " he reported later , " that she did n't charge so hard , so I talked to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your skin . You wo n't get mine . ' " After a while he began singing . He is a singer with little voice and less repertoire . " I ca n't get ' em up , I ca n't get ' em up , I ca n't get ' em up in the morning , " he bellowed , to the tune of reveille , occasionally interposing blasphemous Army paraphrasing . The bear seemed charmed . He switched to The Bear Went Over the Mountain . The beast below seemed appreciative , but refused to go . // He tried bribery and threw down his bag of three grouse . The bear gobbled them up , crunching the bones noisily . It was dark now and , after eating , the bear grunted , lay down and went to sleep . Martin began lighting Kleenex tissues and dropping them on her . The bear roused , but simply flicked them away . Worse , one of them set his tree on fire and when he scrambled lower in desperation to put out the little blaze she started for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . She growled horribly and swiped at him . He sang . She went to sleep again . She aroused at 4 and did her best to murder him again . " Show me the way to go home , " he croaked , shivering with cold , but confident , now , in the power of music . " I 'm tired and I want to go to bed . " She relaxed . At daybreak the bear began showing signs of being satiated with the major 's voice . She wandered away , came back and wandered away again . At 8 o'clock she ambled off and did not return . Martin waited for a half hour and then , finally , slid to the ground , picked up his rifle and made tracks . The bear was gone for good and he got home unmolested . // " I never sang so much in my life , " he said afterward . " Sometimes I sang loud . Sometimes I sang soft . It did n't seem to make any difference . That old bear calmed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limbered up from now on when I go back into the brush  --  and carry a .45. " // AUTUMN // The sharp clamor of geese passing high in the dark , not dogs barking off in barnyards , is what we heard and imagined their strong riding . The football punted away over the copper beech was lost forever ; but in the sanctity of the thicket , there we found a brood of bobwhite with piteous , round and golden eyes under the wind . All along the beach at night the bass fishermen stand , joined to the running sea by their lines . Today was green as a bottle , the air contained in glass . Cows lowed fearfully and the geese came down from Canada and walked in the pastures .  --  GILBERT ROGIN
