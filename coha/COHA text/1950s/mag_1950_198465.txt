At the Fifth International Cancer Congress in Paris , an earnest German scientist reported encouraging results in treating breast cancer with a salve containing a chemical derived from a common garden bulb . <P> Colchicine ( from the autumn crocus , Colchicum autumnale ) has long been prescribed in the treatment of gout . It attracted the attention of cancer researchers because it is poisonous to living cells , impairs their power to divide . Most cancer workers were disappointed with colchicine and soon dropped it . But Dr. Hans Lettr of the University of Heidelberg persisted . He extracted N-methyl-colchicamid , a substance which proved to be ten times as powerful as colchicine itself in preventing the riotous multiplication of cells ( a characteristic of cancer growth ) . <P> Fifty patients with breast cancer had been treated for three to four weeks with a salve containing N-methyl-colchicamid , Dr. Lettr told the Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not keep tabs on them well enough to be sure that any had been free of the disease for five years ( the minimum acceptable for a cancer " cure " ) , but several whose cancers disappeared had been free for three years .
