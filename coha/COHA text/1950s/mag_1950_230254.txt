Gentle Dr.Albert Einstein has a learned complaint to make in the current Scientific American. * In language shrouded in darkling mathematics , he takes modern physicists to task for what he considers their lack of interest in the greatest problem still unsolved . " There exists a passion for comprehension , " writes Dr. Einstein , " just as there exists a passion for music . That passion is rather common in children , but gets lost in most people later on . " Present-day physicists , Einstein believes , are so busy gathering facts about the innards of atoms that they have no time for the great , round , four-dimen sional universe . He lists the main steps toward understanding the universe . First ( after Newton 's useful but insufficient Laws of Motion ) came Maxwell 's work on electromagnetic fields : the effect that electrical charges have upon space . Then Einstein himself , with his Theory of Relativity , explained gravitational fields : the effect that mass has upon space . <P> The correctness of Maxwell 's laws was easily proved ; generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relativity was a great deal harder to check , but its correctness also is firmly established by this time . <P> Many mathematicians and theoretical physicists have tried hard to connect the two theories . Electrical fields and gravitational fields exists in the same space , surrounding the same bodies ; but they seem to be independent , obeying different laws . No one has been able to find a common law that governs both of them . <P> Einstein , who believes passionately that such a law must exist , has devoted the last 30 years of his life to searching for it . A few months ago ( TIME , Jan. 2 ) , he published as an appendix to his third edition of The Meaning of Relativity his Generalized Theory of Gravitation , which he considers the long-sought link between electricity and gravitation , explaining the behavior of both electrons and stars . <P> So far , Einstein complains , no one has proved him right , and no one has proved him wrong . The theoretical physicists , he says , act as if gravitational effects did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is justifiable to ask , ' What would physics look like without gravitation ? ' " <P> So why , Einstein asks , do n't the theoretical physicists really start getting busy and check his new theory against the experience of nature ? " Affirmation or refutation will not be easy , in spite of an abundance of known empirical facts . The derivation , from the equations , of conclusions which can be confronted with experience will require painstaking efforts and probably new mathematical methods .
