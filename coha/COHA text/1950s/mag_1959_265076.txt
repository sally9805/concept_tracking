The season 's most provocative plan for a Broadway musical came from an unlikely impresario : Poet-Novelist-Historian Robert ( The White Goddess ) Graves . The subject , announced by Graves during an Israeli lecture tour : Solomon and Sheba . Plans call for only a dozen beauties to represent Solomon 's 700 wives and 300 concubines . As for casting , Graves hopes to get Lena Horne for Sheba " because she is black but comely , as the Song of Songs says . " For the score , he plans to approach Leonard Bernstein . Solomon and Sheba , says Graves , will be " different from the film on the same subject . Mine will be light and funny . I 'll get a hell of a kick out of doing it . " He also expects to make a quarter of a million dollars .
