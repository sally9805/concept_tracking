Catcher Roy Campanella had the kind of trouble that can drive even normal , non-ballplaying citizens to distraction : doctor bills . " <P> Ever since January , said Dr. Samuel Shenkman , a Manhattan neurosurgeon , he had been trying to collect $9,500 , his price for an operation on Campy 's left hand . Campy had referred the bill to the Dodgers ; the Dodgers had refused to pay . <P> Unimpressed by the fact that Campy had snapped out of a batting slump soon after the operation , Dodger President Walter O'Malley suggested that it was earlier surgery by another doctor that really turned the trick . Let Dr. Shenkman sue . said he . " It appears that Dr. Shenkman thought he was operating on Roy 's bankroll ... He offered to arbitrate before a committee of doctors . I told him I preferred a jury of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " <P> Said Roy Campanella with admirable restraint : " I ai n't saying no more about it . O'Malley 's my lawyer , but I hope he do n't charge me 10,000 bucks . "
