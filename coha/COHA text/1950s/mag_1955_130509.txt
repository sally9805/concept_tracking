It is always reassuring to find that the Old West 's appetite for horsemanship remains unappeased , and that fresh tournaments of slam-bang skill are being invented all the time . For the past three years down in Arizona , the good deputies of the Maricopa County sheriff 's posse and their hard-hitting Quarter horses have been taking on all challengers in a rough-and-tumble game with the innocuous name of pushball . The object of Arizona pushball is simply to push the ball down the field across the opponent 's goal line , but as can be seen from the pictures on the preceding pages , pushing the pushball is no pushover. // Indeed , explains Ernie Collier , a Maricopa County posse-man who wisely referees , there is nothing on horseback quite like pushball . " I 've played polo , and there is no comparison for both speed and roughness on both horse and rider , " Collier says . " Pushball is rough and tough , and the spectators eat it up . Of course men get hurt at every match , but that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't get hurt  --  the people do n't like that . " // The only difficulty is that while all 14 sheriff 's posses in Arizona play pushball , no one has got around to standardizing the rules . In fact , no one has yet got around to finding the rules . However , the Maricopa County team , unbeaten to date and scheduled to defend its state title at Flagstaff on July 24 , has made a start toward drawing up a set of rules . In brief , it calls for a rectangular field with end goal lines and a center line where play starts , four men on each side , and an air-filled ball , made of either rubber or leather , seven feet in diameter ( the ball used to be four feet in diameter , but the horses jumped over it ) . // Once the referee toots his whistle , both teams charge forward at 1 ) the ball and 2 ) at one another much in the manner of Russian cavalry intent upon routing the enemy host in an Eisenstein movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort , there are no offensive plays and no defensive plays . For three periods of 12 minutes each , it 's just one big push . And the matter of fouls is left to the discretion of the referee . The horses themselves do most of the heavy work , sometimes so enthusiastically that they inadvertently throw their riders . This will happen when the eager horse works up a good sweat . He 'll start sticking to the ball and then , in all likelihood , roll his rider off under the ball . // According to Referee Collier , a good horse will " train in " for pushball after only about three hours of training . First the rider works the horse in short takes , getting him used to the ball , then he trains the horse to push the ball . // The history of pushball , short as it is , has almost as many twists and turns as does the style of play itself . Colonel L. T. Godfrey , since 1919 the athletic director of the New Mexico Military Institute at Roswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced to train doughboys during World War I. It was then a dismounted mass exercise , and how Army authorities learned of the game is n't known , though the chances are they picked it up from freshman-sophomore rushes at Yale , Columbia and other colleges , where a sort of pedestrian pushball has been played since the days of turtle-neck sweaters and hair parted in the middle . In any event , Army cavalry units took up pushball from the infantry , pausing only to convert it to a horseman 's pastime . The cavalry , which dispossessed the infantry at the Institute in 1920 , brought along the game , plus a copious supply of balls . // Pushball has enjoyed spurts of popularity in California , though subject naturally to the variations which residents of that state are wont to invent . In other words , in California horses are not often used in pushball . Hot rods , equipped with cowcatchers , are the rage for the game . But this does not mean that the horse has lost its foothold in California . The state is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. devotees of that imported miscellany known as the gymkhana . One brisk gymkhana center is the Thacher School in the Ojai Valley , where the students have been charging about the grounds since 1900 in the event and give no sign of letting up . The gymkhana ( from gend-khana , Hindustani for ball house or racquet court ) at first consisted of pony and horse races at catch weights staged by the British in their Indian outposts . Later on the British added the pagol or " funny races , " some of which were on horseback , others on foot or bicycle . // The gymkhana in vogue at the Thacher School includes such exerting events as tilting , in which the rider , armed with a lance , attempts to spear three rings in a row ; bending , in which the horse and rider wind through five stakes trying to keep from upsetting them ; and broom polo . It 's a pretty hectic program , so much so that one would expect the gymkhana to be dying out in this soft age of golfmobiles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's spreading . Only last week a gymkhana took place at Montauk Point , Long Island , and it 's reported that everyone , including the horses , had a dandy time .
