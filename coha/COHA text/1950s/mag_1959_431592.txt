 | SWORD DANCER PROVES HIS POINT @# The MARK of the champion is the ability to combine obviouslysuperior performance under the most demanding conditions with an ever-so-rare quality of personality that endears one man , or one animal , in 10.000 to those who have the privilege of watching him in action . Sword Dancer is such a rare creature-one in 10,000 , maybe one in 100,000 . When this beautiful 3-year-chestnut with the gleaming white forefeet won last week 's two-mile Jockey Club Gold Cup by an utterly convincing seven lengths over Round Table to nail down the title of Horse e Year ? a title which he had already claimed convincingly with his victory in the Woodward Stakes ( Oct , 5 ) ? he elevated himself in both performance and popularity to the lofty pedestal from which , in years gone by , other American champions like Whirlaway and Citation and Nashua , have looked proudly down on row after row of thoroughly beaten rivals . Sword Dancer won the decisive Gold Cup with far greater ease and eclat than he displayed in his desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Table in the Woodward . Then he had to come between horses and the rail and survive a grueling drive down the stretch ; this time he charged from third to first in one crushing spurt around the far turn and swept away from the field to win easily by a regal seven lengths . He won the way champions are supposed to . His tentative hold on the title of Horse of the Year was being challenged by the greatest money-winning horse of all time . For weeks before Gold Cup day the question was argued : could the 3-year-old Sword Dancer beat the 5-year-old Round Table again ? Would the longer , two-mile distance help or hurt the younger horse ? Sword Dancer , with Jockey Eddie Arcaro up , stepped briskly into the Aqueduct paddock absolutely as fit as could be , to the pleased satisfaction of his owner , Mrs. Isabel Dodge Sloane , and his trainer , the popular young Elliott Burch ( who nonetheless was tense with anticipation ) . @# Then Sword Dancer and Arcaro went the rest of the way on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it big . In fact , they murdered Round Table and Tudor Era and the five other older runners . The last half mile of the contest turned into a rout instead of a horse race . The battle plan devised by Burch and Arcaro was to lay off the pace for at least the first mile of this long grind . There seemed little doubt that Bill Hartack would take Tudor Era to the front at the start . " Tudor Era has speed , " said Arcaro , " and everyone knows he can go a mile and a half any time . Give this sort of a horse his own way under a front-running jock like Hartack and he could be dangerous . " Hartack , as expected , broke on top and within a half mile was four lengths to the good of Round Table , while behind The Table were the longshot Anisado and Sword Dancer . The four other starters ? Inside Tract , Dotted Line , Amanullah and Promised Land ? started behind the first quartet , and finished behind them . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tudor Era in the lead . Arcaro had Sword Dancer running " real relaxed . " Paul Bailey ? a last-second choice to ride Round Table ? later protested that his horse was laboring every step of the way as though he did n't like the going much . Like it or not , this day was never destined to be Round Table 's . And Arcaro made doubly sure . " I made up my mind , " said the Master later , " to make Round Table get to running leaving the three-quarter pole . " When Eddie clucked to his easygoing chestnut on the backstretch the second time around , Sword Dancer moved smoothly but with devastating effectiveness . Round Table was going after Tudor Era , but Arcaro went after both of them . Going into the far turn he swept past Round Table , and Hartack on Tudor Era knew what was coining next . In a flash Sword Dancer ranged alongside @# @#  | Tudor Era and then whizzed by him . " When I hooked the leader , " said Arcaro , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . " Home free he was , too , for as Hartack looked apprehensively behind him to see what in the world had happened to Round Table ( who did get up to take second place from him by a length and a quarter ) Sword Dancer was pulling away almost effortlessly toward the finish line and a pot of $7 ' 0,790 . As he drew closer to the wire he was greeted by the sort of thunderous applause that New York 's knowing audience reserves only for the great ? and at race tracks usually only for the great who happen to be ridden by Eddie Arcaro . This Gold Cup victory , which happened to be Arcaro 's eighth , was something special . When Mrs. Sloane hustled down to the winner 's circle to greet her winning team , she turned to Trainer Burch and exclaimed of Sword Dancer , " He 's a dear little fellow . " " He certainly is , " replied Burch , still shaking like a guy stuck in a Vic Tanny vibrator , " but I 'm awfully glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out to pump Arcaro 's mud-crusted hand and asked , " What do you think of him now ? " " What do I think of him ? " said Eddie . " He is n't a good horse ; he 's a great one . He does things that only champions do ? like rate when you want him to , and move when you have to . If you were all scared that Hartack was going to steal it on Tudor Era , you should n't have been . Nobody steals a two-mile race like this against a horse like Sword Dancer . The only way you win a Gold Cup is to deserve it . And nobody deserved it more today . " BOY TROUBLE The most intriguing aspect of the 41st Jockey Club Gold Cup ? aside from the disappointing performance of Round Table , who gave Sword Dancer no trouble at all ? was the prerace question of which jockey was going to ride The Table in a race which Owner Travis M. Kerr admittedly felt was just about the most important in his horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unnecessary . It all started when Kerr and Trainer Willie Molter felt they had a pretty sure rider in Willie Shoemaker , who had been Round Table 's regular jockey . But Shoemaker , as everyone else around the race track seems to have known , had given a promise to C. V. Whitney to ride Tompion in the Garden State in New Jersey on the same day as the Gold Cup . For some reason ? which even Kerr can not explain ? the Round T. - ble camp felt so sure that Shoemak - would be aboard their horse and re Tompion that until the eleven- .. hour they had failed to find a substitute . And while Shoemaker an his agent Harry Silbert were indee anxious to ride Round Table ( the agents do n't actually ride , but t1 language makes you think they do they had a ready answer a mon:n ago for anybody interested in the.r October 31 plans . " We gave first call to Mr. Whitney in the Cowdin , the Champagne a : the Garden State , " said Silbert. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Round Table , but right is right , and if : Whitney wants to hold us to ( L.r promise we 'll be at Garden State the day . " Mr. Whitney , natural : : . did still want Willie Shoemaker . The significance of this wide distributed message never flash i through to Travis Kerr until the la moment , and then there was frantically struggling to find another jock . The rumors were all over : Henry More : . ' Willie Harmatz , and finally Bill H ..  - -  tack . On the morning of the Gold Cup Kerr himself tried to talk Hartack into accepting the mount ? eN , -a though Hartack was almost sure : ride Tudor Era . Hartack said no . " W had a misunderstanding in the sun 1 mer of 1958 in Chicago , " Bill ex plained later , " and even if I cou : get it I do n't want his money th bad . I 've lost respect for Mr. Kerr and frankly I would n't ride th man 's horse if he gave me the who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride on Round Table , and he as well with it as Shoemaker , H : . - tack , Harmatz or Moreno won have ? or even a combination of . : four of them . A light drizzle for four hours before post time had not tered the track from fast , and both Kerr and Molter said they knew : re track would not affect Round Tal .. ? - .. Later , however , Bailey said he thought it probably had . The real answer is that neither the jockey mixup nor the racing surfa-i. defeated Round Table . In the mor ing line of last Saturday 's newspapers Round Table 's jockey was Es as " No Boy . " Well , with nothing him that afternoon but an em ' - saddle he would have still been be .. en ? for the pure and simple reas ,  - -  that he was going against a re : , champion . Sword Dancer is one the very , very best .                 @ @ @ @
