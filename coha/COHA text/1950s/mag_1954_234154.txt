After five years as a New Jersey schoolteacher , Edward M. Hough , 28 , took one more look at his five-day job-at $74 a week-and decided that he was through . He liked his job teaching fifth grade at Trenton 's McClelland School , and , with a master 's degree in education behind him , he had long planned to make teaching his career . But he also had to support his wife and three-year-old twins , and to make ends meet , he was on a treadmill of odd jobs outside of school hours : bill collecting , refereeing occasional basketball and football games , pumping gasoline at a neighborhood filling station . With all the extra work , he was still not making enough - not nearly as much as he could get as a truck driver ( a possible $120 a week ) or as full-time filling-station man . <P> Last week Hough was settled in a new and better-paying job , as lessee of a filling station on his own . His starting income there was $100 a week , and the prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station 's manager , was another ex-teacher , Walter E. Almond , 30 . Almond , also an M.A. and formerly a handicrafts instructor at Trenton 's Junior High School No. 3 , had had to supplement his $74 a week by working as a part-time painter , auto mechanic and roofer . Like Hough , he regretted leaving his profession . His starting salary at Hough 's filling station : $85.
