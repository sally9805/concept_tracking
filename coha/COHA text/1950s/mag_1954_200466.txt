Last week the U.S. Senate showed rare skill at sleight of hand . In one and the same motion , it passed the Hawaiian-Alaskan statehood bill by an impressive 57-to-28 vote and killed the chances of both territories for this year . Reason : the bill , as many of the Senators were fully aware , can not get through the House . <P> Already passed by the House was a measure for Hawaiian-and only Hawaiian-statehood . This was the bill that the Senate finally passed last week , a year behind schedule . But the Senate had made a change in the bill : it had amended it to include statehood for Alaska . To reconcile the two versions , a House-Senate conference is necessary ; it will probably not be held . <P> The House can appoint conferees only by 1 ) unanimous consent , which Southern Representatives will be happy to refuse because they do n't like the idea of statehood for multiracial Hawaii , or 2 ) a go-ahead from its legislative traffic cop , the Rules Committee , controlled by the G.O.P. leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker Joe Martin made no secret of Republican plans to let the bill die quietly . Said Martin : " We have a pretty busy program and ca n't waste time with something that ca n't pass . " Asked if there was any pressure to send the bill to conference , Martin replied : " No , but I know of plenty who 'll see it does not go to conference . " <P> One slight chance remained : the possibility of an all-out effort by President Eisenhower to get the bill through Congress . And Dwight Eisenhower is already on the record against Alaskan statehood at this time . <P> Last week the Congress also : Advanced , by a party-line 7-to-6 vote in the Senate Labor Committee , a Taft-Hartley revision bill along the lines of President Eisenhower 's recommendations ( TIME , Jan. 18 ) . Missing from the bill : an Eisenhower proposal for a secret strike ballot under Government auspices . <P> Scheduled for debate this week in the House , a bill permitting court use of wiretap evidence in cases involving national defense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espionage and sedition . The evidence would be admissible only when the wiretap had been authorized in writing by the Attorney General . The House Judiciary Committee voted for the bill , 19 to 9 . <P> Killed in the House , by a 21140-176 count , President Eisennower 's four-year , 140,000-unit public housing program . The House also refused to grant the President authority to raise interest rates for new G.I. home loans and other Government-insured mortgages . With these modifications , the House passed and sent to the Senate what was left of the Administration 's omnibus housing bill . <P> Reduced by $59 million , in the House Appropriations Committee , the Interior Department 's budget request , thus brought it down to $363,360,989 . <P> Jumped , in the House , when an amateur photographer set off a flashbulb in the gallery - in the same spot where Puer to Rican terrorists stood and fired on Congressmen just a month before .
