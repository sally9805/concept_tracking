Atomic scientists passed a kind of milestone . Last week they announced the creation of Element 100 , a job done by " fattening " atoms of Plutonium 239 ( 94 protons , 145 neutrons ) in the materials testing reactor at Arco , Idaho . The plutonium atoms absorbed 15 neutrons and emitted six beta particles ( electrons ) . Since a neutron minus an electron equals a proton , the net result was Element 100 ( 100 protons , 154 neutrons ) . <P> Element 100 had almost as many creators ( from Argonne National Laboratory , California 's Radiation Laboratory and elsewhere ) as it has neutrons . It has a half life of three hours . It has no name so far , and no foreseeable uses .
