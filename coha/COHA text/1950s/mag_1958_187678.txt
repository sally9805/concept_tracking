When Sheriff J. G. ( for James Gray ) Treloar was accused of beating up and fatally injuring a Negro prisoner in his jail , few in north Mississippi 's red clay Yalobusha County expected much to come of it . But when a grand jury indicted Treloar for manslaughter , white citizens in the county seat of Water Valley moved fast . Remembering the " bad publicity " of the Emmett Till case three years before in neighboring Tallahatchie County ( TIME , Oct. 3 , 1955 ) , they dissuaded Water Valley Negroes from hiring an N.A.A.C.P. lawyer , instead chipped in for a white attorney to act as the district attorney 's special prosecutor . <P> As the trial opened , 500 spectators jammed the county courthouse , saw the lawyers and Till-Case Circuit Judge Curtis Swango select an all-white jury . Nearly everyone in Water Valley ( 1950 pop . 3,213 ) knew the dead prisoner , Woodrow Wilson Daniel , 37 . Many remembered him as a grocery delivery boy and as a dependable bootlegger for both races . Everyone also knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a prohibition platform , had kept an eye on Daniel since Daniel , three months earlier , was acquitted of a bootlegging charge . And nearly everyone in town knew that Sheriff Treloar had hauled in Daniel one night last June along with bottles of " evidence " that contained disputed portions of water and whisky . <P> A white woman jailed at the same time on a forgery charge testified that she saw Treloar walk into the cell and hit Daniel " ten or twelve times " with a club . Another white prisoner testified that on another occasion the sheriff caught Daniel " hollering out a window , " clubbed him " three or four times . " Respected Dr. Maubry McMillan , summoned at midnight to treat the stricken Daniel in jail , said Treloar told him : " I had to tap him on the head . " Another physician testified that Daniel died nine days later of a brain hemorrhage . <P> Sheriffs from a dozen neighboring counties sat together in the courtroom to show their regard for lanky ( 6 ft. 2 in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stand that he had rapped Daniel once to make him behave after his arrest for bootlegging and speeding , and that in the jail he had tapped Daniel three or four times on the shoulder and buttocks . Sure , he also nudged him with a toe to sit up for Dr. McMillan . Argued one of Treloar 's four attorneys : " You are not trying him for whipping somebody . You 're trying him for killing somebody . " <P> After 26 minutes , the jury found Treloar not guilty . The sheriff winked at his pretty wife , accepted congratulations from fellow sheriffs , retrieved his blackjack from the evidence table . Said he : " Now , by God , I can get back to rounding up bootleggers and niggers. "
