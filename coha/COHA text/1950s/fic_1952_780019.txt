 | flowers blooming all around them and the light from the lanterns shining down from overhead ? I do n't wonder no one wants to go home ! Everybody loves them . And perhaps it sounds like a silly thing to say , but everyone respects them . They 've stood for so much in the community . . . . Well , I did n't mean to get sentimental , but somehow , seeing them as they stood there . . . . Shall we go on to the drawing room ? " " I understand that and the dining room have hardly been changed at all . Suppose we leave those for later inspection , if there is time . I 'm really more interested in seeing what has been done upstairs . " " just as you like . Of course , there are only four upstairs chambers ? strange in such a large house , is n't it ? Why , as you 've seen , I have as many in my little one ! Do you care which room we visit first ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one on the right at the rear . " " Just as you like , " Cary said again . " That 's always been the guest room . The other rear room 's normally Bushrod 's  --  my brother 's . But he never was here much , even before he married , and he has n't been back at all since my wedding . So that room 's virtually another guest chamber . As far as that goes , mine is , too , now . But I 'll go on thinking of it as mine , and I know Father and Mother will , too ; I 'm sure they 'll always keep it just as I left it and call it ' Cary 's room ' and not put guests in it unless there are so many they ca n't be accommodated elsewhere . I 'll show it to you afterward , and the view you get of the river from there , in case you 've forgotten how beautiful it is . I love the river , just as Father does .... But this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Again Cary threw open a closed door . There were subdued lights in the room and pale flowers  --  evidently it had been readied for the possible convenience of some guest at the fete champetre who might wish to retire briefly in order to " fancy up . " But it had the telltale look of a room that is seldom used and never really lived in . The house was in shining order throughout , but elsewhere it lacked the sterile immaculacy of this one . The marquise drew back with a little cry . " But this is entirely changed ! My beautiful Empire furniture is not here ! Where was it put ? " Cary shook her head . " Why , I do n't know ! Those convent beds have been in it ever since I can remember . I 'm sure I 'm not mistaken , I 've heard so many persons comment on them . I do n't need to tell you that most typical Louisiana beds are immense , that generally , only nuns slept in narrow ones , and that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were regarded as a curiosity . . . . Well , of course sometimes youth beds ' were narrow , too  --  my own was , for that matter . It was just as pretty as it could be . I 've kept it and I 'm glad I have  --  I 'll enjoy seeing it in use again . But it 's years since I 've slept in it myself . I have a spool bed in my room now . "  | " A spool bed ! You mean that cottage type Jenny Lind is supposed to have favored ? " " Yes . I happen to favor it , too . Perhaps it 's an odd taste , but I do . " V ? " And that magnificent Empire furniture  --  it simply disappeared ? " Cary shook her head again . " I 'm sorry , I do n't know . It certainly is n't here . The storerooms are cleaned religiously every year , and I 've seen my youth bed ' put in the sun , along with the other pieces that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in storage again . There is n't any Empire furniture among them . And , as you 'll see for yourself , Bushrod 's bedroom set is quite good Mallard and Father and Mother have a superb Seignouret . " " Then I shall inquire from your father what has become of my valuable possessions , and ask to have them returned , since he so misprized them . " All the frustration of the past weeks suddenly burst its bounds . Standing on the threshold of that room which had been the scene of her most voluptuous delights , and which was now so cold and conventual in its austerity , the marquise was beside herself with rage and beyond watching her words . Cary answered her coolly . " Are you quite sure you want to do that ? I mean , Father bought everything from you outright , did n't he  --  the plantation with all its equipment and the house with all its furnishings ? If there were some things that he did n't care for or could n't use , there was no reason why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was every reason why he should not make kindling wood of the furniture in my chamber and put the beds of nuns in its place ! It is a personal insult ! I shall tell him I found it so , no matter how hard you try to stop me . " " I sha n't try to stop you . I should n't think you 'd want to , that 's all . " " That 's all ! That 's all ! Let me assure you , my fine young lady , that ' ll is not all ! You have been bragging about your mother 's cachet , ' you have told me how greatly respected ' your father is in this community . Well , your mother did not have enough cachet to keep her fiance faithful , and your father would not be so much respected if I told all I know about him . This mutual show of conjugal devotion is very touching , I admit . But I could pull the props from under it in one minute . There would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I promise you . And as for your father , he would be glad to slink away in shame ! " She paused , breathlessly , and glared at Cary as if defying the girl to put an end to her torrent of speech or to prevent her from dashing down the stairs and denouncing her host in his own garden . The fact that Cary continued to look at her coolly and speak to her calmly increased her fury to the point of frenzy . " I 'm not sure I follow everything you 're trying to tell me , " the girl  | said quietly . " It 's hard for me to believe you want to proclaim that something shameful happened in this room , while you were living here , which involved my father . Because that would involve you , too , would n't it ? I should n't think any woman who 's passed , more or less , for a lady would want to destroy the illusion by announcing that she 's not . As I 've said , Father 's never talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is n't the kind that would ever kiss and tell . But I suppose various kinds of women were mixed up in his early life ? there are in most men 's early lives , are n't there ? Even so , they know the difference between the various kinds , do n't they ? I mean usually . Perhaps Father was mistaken about thinking you were a lady , at first . But he never , never would have made a mistake like that about Mother . " " If you think I 'm going to stand here and let you insult me ? " " I 'm not trying to insult you . And I 've told you already , I 'm not trying to stop you from doing anything you want . But I believe it 's a kindness to try to make you understand that Father thinks the sun rises and sets on Mother 's head . He always has ; he always will . That does n't mean he might n't do things he was ashamed of afterward ? especially if he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in shame any more than he would kiss and tell . If you really do want to go out in the garden and shout to everyone who will listen that he made kindling wood out of your bedroom furniture , why do n't you do it ? " As if she were actually encouraging the marquise to take such vehement action , Cary closed the door of the guest room and moved in a leisurely way toward the stairs . There was no question , now , that she was leaning on the scarlet parasol and that she was glad of its support . But for all that , her words continued to come easily and quietly . " There 's one thing you 're right about though , " she said . " That 's the part about forgiving and forgetting . Of course Mother would n't forgive Father for something that happened more than twenty-five years ago . You do n't forgive people you love . You just love them . And you do n't have to force yourself to forget something that does n't matter anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make would come as a surprise or a shock to Mother , perhaps I ought to warn you that I believe you 're wrong . Naturally , she 's never mentioned the matter to me , but if I 'm not terribly mistaken , she 's known all about it for years . I did n't know it until a few weeks ago , when I overheard Belle talking about you to her daughter Titine , who 's my maid now . They thought I was asleep and they did n't notice that my bedroom door was open , either . Probably something accidental like that happened in this house , too . I know Belle would n't purposely do anything she thought would make Mother unhappy . But Negroes have a sort of sixth sense about love affairs , especially illicit love affairs  --  what  | they do n't know , they guess , and they 're awfully good at guessing , particularly when they combine it with a little eavesdropping . And they do gossip among themselves about what they 've guessed , or overheard , or seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later , someone overhears them . . . . Well , shall we go downstairs ? Evidently , there 's nothing more you want to see here . " The marquise gripped the newel post . " So your mother is sacrosanct , " she sneered . " But what about you ? Is it conceivable that , in your case , a man might have some difficulty in deciding what kind of a woman you were ? " " Why yes , " Cary answered unhesitatingly . " Yes , it 's quite conceivable . Only , in my case , he 'd find out that even if I gave a wrong impression at first , I really was a lady after all . Because you see , that 's what I decided I wanted to keep on being . Of course I was born one , and that 's an advantage to start with . For a while I thought maybe such an advantage was n't important . But fortunately I found out my mistake before it was too late . And who do you suppose helped me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father ! He was quite insistent on the point . So that ? " Cary concluded , her foot already on the first step , " will give you some idea of what he thinks of strumpets . " Nape CHAPTER XI 11 TIE HOPE which the marquise had expressed to her son of an early return to New Orleans , after the fete champetre , had been repeated , without overmuch finesse , to her hostess , in whom she found a ready listener . Yes , the sooner they were off , the better , Mrs. Vincent agreed heartily ; it was all very well for Lamartine to keep harping on the necessity of overseeing the crops at this season ; men never realized how much was involved in preparing for an important wedding . Besides , Savoie and Mr. Batchelor were quite capable of looking after the land , between them ; now that Victoria and Cindy Lou were , to all intents and purposes , one and the same plantation , the situation was entirely different from that which had prevailed before the two families were allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reasonable viewpoint , he could stay by himself at Victoria , where the servants dear Lucy had trained so well were quite capable of taking care of him . For that matter , he could stay with Savoie and Cary at the new Monteregard ; after all , the lune de miel was now long since  | over , the household well organized ; the jeune menage should not object to a visitor ... . With the two ladies in such complete accord , plans had been made for them to take their departure the day following the fete champetre . Armande and Pierre were to accompany them ; and Mr. Vincent had raised no objection to the prospect of a period of comparative solitude at Victoria  --  in fact , his wife had somewhat indignantly gathered that he would enjoy it . Cary had also inferred that Savoie was far from displeased at the arrangement ; although he had not actually said so , she had guessed , without too much trouble , that the more he saw of the De Chanets the less he liked them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the strain of listening to the interminable discussion of nuptial preparations . She had never seen him in better spirits than when he took his customary affectionate leave of her before going out to ride the crops , the morning after the garden party ; and his good humor was enhanced by the consciousness that Cary seemed more like herself , in every way , than she had in a long while . Her malaise had apparently disappeared completely ; her color was good and so was her appetite ; she rose soon after her husband , joined him in a substantial breakfast and chatted with great sprightliness about the success of the fete champetre over their hominy grits , cakes , cuite and coffee . Savoie was whistling as he went down the steps of the gallery , and he turned back twice to wave a gay farewell to Cary , before he finally cantered out of sight . When he had gone , Cary found time hanging rather heavily on her hands . It was only a matter of minutes for her to set her well-oiled household machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urgent nature for her to do . Though she was now feeling so well again , she was debarred from riding , and she had also been warned to undertake no further strenuous exercise of any kind for the present . Nearly all the flowers in her garden had been sent to Cindy Lou , the day before , to supplement her mother 's in the scheme of decoration ; it did not take her half an hour to gather and arrange those which were left . Her mother would be resting , she knew , at her father 's insistence , and Clyde himself would be out with Savoie . Her mother-in-law and Armande and their guests would be in the last throes of packing ; she had said good-by to them all the evening before , in order to make sure she would not be a hindrance rather than a help at the last moment . There were no other neighbors near enough to make mere morning visiting feasible and Savoie would be expecting to have her with him by dinnertime . Suppressing a slight sigh , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her sewing basket and went out to the gazebo . Thanks to Lucy 's teaching , she was an expert needlewoman ; but fine sewing had never held the attraction for her that it had for the  | women of her mother 's generation . She stitched away rather intermittently , laying down her handiwork every few minutes to look at the satisfactory , but unstimulating , scene before her , and trying to refrain from daydreaming because such dreams seemed so persistently to take her in a direction from which she was resolutely trying to withdraw . At the same time , she could not help wishing that some unexpected diversion would present itself , though if she had been able to guess the form this diversion would take , she would have tried to suppress the wish with the same perseverance that she was trying to suppress the daydreams . While she was growing increasingly restless because of unbroken monotony , she became conscious of approaching footsteps , and looked up from her sewing to see Pierre coming toward her down the garden walk . She sprang up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a still more unwelcome pang of pleasure . Swiftly and involuntarily , as she had so often done before , she compared his air of sophistication and accomplished ease to Savoie 's more ingenuous and less urbane manner . At the same instant , she thought for the first time , with gratification , that Pierre looked far more like his father than like his mother . To be sure , he had her fine high coloring ; but the two men had the same graceful , though wiry , build , the same proud carriage and the same inescapable charm . The smile with which Pierre now greeted Cary , in response to her startled and stammered welcome , was dazzling in its effect . She tried to tell herself that this was merely the result of extraordinarily white teeth beneath a closely clipped but very black mustache . " Why , Pierre ! I thought you had gone back to New Orleans ! " she exclaimed inadequately . In her sudden rise , she had dropped her workbasket , scattering its contents in every direction . Before replying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tomatoshaped pincushion , the scissors simulating a tiny bird with a long beak , the jewel-topped gold thimble , the various packets of small needles and the many spools of fine thread . Having restored all these objects to their proper places , he handed her the basket with a sweeping bow ; she did not notice until afterward that he had not replaced her handiwork . " I had expected to go , " he answered imperturbably . If he had noticed her confusion , as she was sure he must have , he gave no sign of this ; and he did not make even an indirect reference to the fact that he had gathered up the small belongings which had been strewn over the floor of the gazebo because of her precipitate movement . " However , this morning my mother sent out word , through the maid who took in her tray , that she was completely prostrated by migraine , " he went on . " It was quite out of the question that she should travel , it was even impossible for her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , somewhat upsetting to the general program . " " Has Dr. Bringier been called in ? " Cary inquired , again quite inadequately . " No . My poor mother declined to consult a physician . I went in to see her , after her message had been delivered , and gathered that she was suffering from a crise de nerfs as much as from anything else . She not infrequently has those , sometimes on very slight provocation , if I may say so . This time it appears that the sight of her old home was too much for her delicate nervous system to support without injury . Personally , I do not see why it should have upset her . I have never heard her express the slightest affection for Cindy Lou , or any regret because she had sold it  --  indeed , I had always gathered that your father 's purchase of it was more or less providential . And certainly , he and Mrs. Batchelor have maintained it beautifully . I was charmed with it , myself . " Cary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her composure , made no immediate reply , and nothing in her face revealed either sympathy or surprise . Indeed , her expression had suddenly become singularly noncommittal . " As a matter of fact , I am charmed by everything connected with this region , " Pierre continued . Cary had not asked him to sit down , but he seemed to take it for granted that she would be glad to have him do so , and had seated himself beside her ; it was then that she noticed , for the first time , the piece of fine cambric which he was still holding in his hand . " So I am very glad of the pretext , which my poor mother 's indisposition gives me , for lingering in the vicinity a little longer . " " But I thought Armande had made an appointment with her dressmaker for tomorrow . " " She had . She left on the morning train . Since obviously she could not go alone and since her mother , without showing herself remiss as a hostess , could not leave mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Surely Armande must have taken it for granted that you would accompany her , too ! " " By no means . A man who reveals himself neglectful , as a son , is a very poor prospect as a husband on whose sympathetic devotion a wife can unfailingly count . Armande required practically no argument to convince her of this . She understood my position almost before I had explained it to her : I could not leave my mother unassuaged in her sufferings ; my duty to remain with her was very clear . " " I do n't see why . You 've said that she did n't want a doctor , and that quite often she has slight nervous upsets which , obviously , you do n't take very seriously . "  | " Ah ! I should have been more careful not to sound contradictory . But somehow , I thought that while Armande required very few explanations of my attitude , you would require none at all . " " I 'm afraid I 'm not as subtle as you give me credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you should n't have gone on to New Orleans with Armande today . From what you 've said , I should think your mother would probably be well enough to follow tomorrow or the day after . In the meanwhile , if she does n't even feel like drinking black coffee , no doubt all she wants is to lie still in a dark room with a handkerchief wrung out in cologne water on her forehead . " " But I have told you quite candidly that I was charmed with this region , that I welcomed a pretext to linger longer in it . " " Yes . But of course you 're even more charmed with Armande than you are with this region . What 's more , you 're engaged to her . " " Your second statement is correct . Your first leaves something to be desired in the way of complete accuracy . I have never thought you were subtle ; indeed , I have always found your naivete one of your most appealing attributes , Cary . But surely you 're not such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that I was glad to stay over a day at Victoria without the pleasant , but somewhat handicapping , presence of my fiancee and her father . " Pierre looked at her with a smile that was even more engaging than the one with which he had greeted her . But this time Cary did not think of it merely as dazzling ; she also thought of it as dangerous . She had seen that look on his face before , when they were riding together in the enchanted forest , toward the gypsy camps and the wooded slopes leading to the grottoes which fringed the river that widened into the Blue Pool , where a girl who had lost her lover had drowned herself , long , long ago ... . " I do n't believe I 'm altogether an ingenue , " she replied , with a calmness she was very far from feeling . " I do n't believe you mother thinks so , either  --  in fact , I 'm very much afraid that her crise de nerfs may be partly due to some remarks which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , I doubt whether your regard for me would stand up under the knowledge of just what those remarks were . In the light of them , and of your mother 's illness , I do n't think it 's fair for me to detain you here . I think it would be far better for you to go back to Victoria and see if there is n't something you can do  --  what was the expression you used ? ? to assuage her sufferings . " As she spoke , Cary made a movement as if to rise and bring their interview to an end . Pierre leaned forward and , still holding the piece of cambric in one fine , flexible hand , laid the other over both of hers . " Cary , I need assuagement myself . I need your assurance that you understand . "  | " Of course I understand , " she retorted , withdrawing her hands from his reach . " A girl does n't have to be a complete nitwit , even if she is an ingenue . And I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're by no means a nitwit and , if you prefer , I will concede that you 're not an ingenue , either , " he replied , with surprising quiet . He did not try to take her hands again . However , something about the very fact that he refrained from doing so made his speech more compelling . " But I am more and more convinced that you do not understand  --  at least , not what I want you to . " " Very well . Then I will listen while you explain . But I would like to go on with my sewing while you do so . Will you please give my work back to me ? I 'm afraid I did n't thank you properly for picking up the other things . Perhaps that 's why you 've kept on holding the cambric  --  to remind me of my manners . " " Not at all . I have been holding it because it was yours , something with which you were intimately connected and  --  as such  --  precious to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrutinizing it for the first time . " I 've been holding it all crumpled up , " he remarked apologetically , smoothing it out as he spoke . " I did not realize what it was  --  I thought probably a chemise for yourself . Now I see that it is a baby 's dress . Is that why you want it back , Cary ? So that you will be reminded , while I am talking to you , that you are going to have a baby ? " " No . I 'd rather keep busy , that 's all . I do n't need any reminder that I 'm going to have a baby  --  or that I 'm married to one of the best men in the world . " " But you are reproaching yourself because you feel that sometimes you forgot about your married state and your husband 's great qualities , while you were visiting at the chateau ? " " Yes . I reproach myself very much for that . I always shall . But at least I do n't intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't intend that you shall , either . But neither do I intend to leave you without convincing you , if I can , that what happened between you and me last year was important to me , that I did n't regard it like one of many pleasant amorous episodes and nothing else ? nothing more . " " It is n't in the least essential that I should know how you regarded it , Pierre . " " Indeed it is . It is very essential to me , as I shall try to explain , if you will give me a chance . And I believe it is essential to you also . I believe you will be much happier in the future if you know that I never thought of you as a light of love  --  not even potentially . I thought of you  --  and still think of you  --  not only as one of the most desirable , but as one of the most companionable , one of the blithest , one of the  | loveliest women I have ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been proud to have for my wife , if she had been free . I 'm speaking in deadly earnest now , Cary . Do n't you believe me ? " She turned her head away , without answering . Again he leaned forward and took her hands and , this time , she did not withdraw them . " Please look at me , Cary . Please answer me . I asked you if you did n't believe me . " " You make me believe you  --  almost , " she whispered , still without looking at him . " That is n't enough . I want to make you believe me  --  not almost , but wholly . Because I swear that what I 'm telling you is true . If I swear it , wo n't you believe me ? " " Ye-e-s , I think so . " " And wo n't you admit that if you do believe me , you 'll he happier than you 've been in a long while ? Happier than since you knew you were going to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were engaged ? Happier than you 've been at all since you knew there was n't any escape for you and since you began to think that I 'd held you cheap ? " " Yes , " she said again . But this time , though she still did not turn to look at him , it was not because of hesitancy and doubt , but because there were tears in her eyes which she did not want him to see , even if he knew they were there . " Then I can be very candid with you , which is what I hoped . I did not look on you as a light of love ; I would have asked you to marry me if you had been free . But since you were not , I did think that , in time , I might persuade you to become my mistress . I do not mean one of many loose women with whom I had transient affairs ; I mean what used to be called , in the days of royalty , a maitresse en titre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose station and standing were understood and , strange as it may seem to you , respected . There are still many such women in France , even if that special designation is gone . Indeed , there is hardly a Frenchman of any standing who has not had , or does not have , such a woman in his life . It is more or less taken for granted that he should . And it does not create a scandal , as I now understand it would  --  and does  --  when such an arrangement is made in the United States . " " And do you mean to tell me that the mistresses of these prominent men are still respected , too ? " " Yes , in a way . " " It must be a very strange way . . . . What about their husbands ? " " Well , of course the husbands . . . . " For the first time , Pierre him . self hesitated . " Perhaps we had better not try to go into the husbands ' side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurriedly . " After all , I was only  | trying to interpret the lovers ' side  --  the real lovers , not the incorrigible libertines . So I will repeat that , when I came to Louisiana , it was with the hope that I could persuade you to become my mistress  --  my dearly beloved , highly regarded mistress . And I had hardly landed when I was told you were enceinte . " Again he smoothed the baby 's dress across his knee . " It was a blow , I admit , " he said , " a very great blow . Not only to my love , but to my pride . I had thought of you as waiting to welcome me , of counting the days until we could meet again . " " I was , " Cary said in a low voice . " I should n't have been , but I was . I was even poring through old lawbooks , trying to find out whether I could n't discover something in them that would prove Savoie had cause for divorce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not actually draw farther away from her , somehow he gave the effect of doing so . " Ah , divorce , " he said in a changed voice . " There I must differ with you , Cary . If you had been free when I met you , as I have just told you , nothing would have made me happier than to have you for my wife . But marriage with a divorcee  --  especially with a woman whose husband had divorced her for cause  --  that would have been quite impossible for me . " " So my father said . He said that was the way you 'd feel about it , " Cary remarked scornfully . " You discussed the matter with your stepfather ? I 'm rather sorry you did that , Cary . Inevitably , he must have formed a very low opinion of me . And from the way you spoke just now , I gather that he was fairly successful in turning you against me . I was conscious , of course , that you were avoiding me , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me finish what I started to say . I was counting the days until we could meet again , and I was confident that when we did I could persuade you to become my mistress . I thought we would arrange to see each other , very discreetly of course , but constantly and  --  intimately . Then I thought you would persuade your husband to bring you back to France , in the near future , for another long visit , and that thus we could resume our liaison . I thought this delightful arrangement could go on and on . It never entered my head that you would already be with child  --  Savoie 's child . Of course it should have . I can see now that the wonder is you were n't enceinte much sooner , that you did not either have a baby while you were still in France , or hasten your return so that you might have your accouchement at home . This present pregnancy of yours might well have been your second . It is evident that you are destined for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amoureuse . I was very blind not to realize that in the first place . And when my eyes were opened , I confess that I was very angry  --  unreasonably , with you ; logically , with myself . And  | it was quite natural that when I was in such a frame of mind , I should succumb very easily and quickly to the charms of a girl like Armande . " " I see , " Cary said , still scornfully . " There is no reason why I should not say that she fell in love with me at first sight , since she and her mother have both said the same thing themselves , " Pierre went on , disregarding the scorn this time . " And of course , that was not only very flattering to me , since she is such a beautiful and accomplished girl , but very soothing to my pride . I responded instinctively to her affection . " " Just the same , I do n't suppose you tried to seduce her . " " Certainly not . A gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is a jeune fine Bien elevee . It would be offensive to his principles . Besides , what would be the point ? She will soon be his bride in any case . Why should he deliberately lessen the triumphant joys of his wedding night by anticipating them ? " " I do n't know any reason why he should . But then I do n't know , either , why a gentleman should deliberately set out to make another man 's wife disloyal to her husband . And I do n't believe , Pierre , there is anything you can say that will make me understand , or that there 's anything to be gained by continuing this conversation any longer . I hope you wo n't try to see me again , either , no matter how long your mother 's illness detains you . In fact , I shall tell the servants to say I 'm not at home if you call . Now , if you 'll please give me back my baby 's dress .... " She rose and stretched out her hand . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers , but he found he could not continue to hold them unless he did so forcibly . He looked at her reproachfully and shook his head . " It grieves me very much to part from you like this , " he said reproachfully . " It grieves me , too , " she answered . But her voice was not reproachful . It was still scornful . " However , we are not saying good-by to each other for good , " she added . " I shall be seeing you again at your wedding . " It was universally and enthusiastically agreed in New Orleans that the wedding of Pierre de Chanet and Armande Vincent was the outstanding social event of the spring season . For the occasion , golden ornaments from the cathedral treasure had been brought forth and set on the high altar , where they glittered in the radiant candelight . The archbishop , always a majestic figure , seemed to have achieved added stature and dignity as he stood at the entrance of the sanctuary , clad in full pontificals , awaiting the arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strains of Meyerbeer 's " Prophete . " First , clad in their multicolored  | medieval costumes , marched the two huge Swiss guards , who acted in their official capacity only at the most important ceremonies . Then came the twelve ushers , in formal evening dress , their glace gloves and stiff shirt fronts in complete harmony with the waxen tone of their white boutonnieres . They were followed by the twelve bridesmaids , in white mousseline de soie , their " half veils " confined with wreaths of white roses and garlands of roses linking them together in couples . Next came two little flower girls , also wearing " half veils " and wreaths of roses , but dressed in sheer mull instead of mousseline de soie , as being more suited to their tender age , and scattering petals from gilded and beribboned baskets , instead of carrying garlands . They in turn were followed by the bride , on her father 's arm , a coronet of diamonds encircling the rose point lace which fell in creamy cascades over her shoulders and flowed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and last of all , in accordance with time-honored custom , the groom 's mother , escorted by the groom , and the bride 's mother , escorted by the groom 's father . Though the stir which the De Chanets had at first created had begun to subside somewhat by the time the wedding took place , the appearance , in juxtaposition , of the old marquis and the young one gave rise to whispered remarks that both were certainly looking their polished best . The ushers had all appeared correctly attired to the last detail , until Pierre came up the aisle ; now , by comparison , not one of them seemed perfectly turned out . As for the marquise , her costume left nothing to be desired in the way of chic . But the great surprise , the really startling sight in the cathedral , had been the appearance of Cary Page Vincent . Naturally , the news that she was enceinte , at last , had spread , and there had been much murmuring  --  some of it sympathetic , some of it satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be in the cortege and this created a vacancy for a " real Louisianian . " It had also been vaguely assumed that if she did come to the wedding at all , she would be wearing some sort of a loose wrap , no matter what the weather , and that she would be seated inconspicuously . The ladies who had been busily ticking off time on their fingers had somehow overlooked the fact that she could not yet be far enough along to have a noticeably altered figure . The more general assumption had been that she would not put in an appearance at all . According to rumor , she had made a great deal of fuss about her morning sickness  --  as if nine out of every ten women did not have it and some of them practically every year , during the early stages of their married life ! But then , everyone knew that Cary Page had always been an enfant gdte .... She entered the cathedral on her husband 's arm . The organist was already playing the chords which presaged the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone was on the alert for its arrival ; therefore , all eyes were on the center aisle and the older and more hidebound contingent among the guests gave an audible gasp . Instead of some nondescript dark-hued sacque , Cary was wearing a dress which was almost exactly the color of her hair . This , in itself , was a drastic departure from custom . Baby blue was traditionally the favored color for blondes ; they might , occasionally , switch to a very pale pink or a very delicate green , for the sake of change ; but yellow was something that they never , never wore ! Yet , here was Cary wearing it , one might almost say flaunting it , in the face of the public ; and strangely enough , the effect , if it had not been so startling , would have been distinctly pleasing . The dress was made with enormous sleeves , and , below them , Cary 's wrists and arms were encircled with glittering bracelets . The bodice was cut surplice fashion , with a V-shaped neck just low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage ; and the folds of the satin were so arranged as to display the shape of the breast in the most effective possible manner . If Cary 's figure could have been said to possess a fault , heretofore , this was because it had lacked the allure of full-blown femininity ; now the curves of her bosom were beautiful . Moreover , she had achieved a " straight front " unparalleled in New Orleans for its perfection , and her many-gored skirt flared out from her trim waist , catching every variation of light as she moved . Two small yellow wings , evidently the plumage of some bright bird , fastened together at their base with a bow of yellow ribbon , constituted her headdress ; the feathers were poised delicately over her hair , creating the illusion not only of added height but of swift and effortless motion . They made the laden hats worn by other women look top heavy and grotesque . She was carrying a large bouquet of yellow roses , from which streamers of golden gauze fluttered ; and , as she progressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bowing to acquaintances . When she finally reached the front pew , she slipped her arm easily from Savoie 's , releasing him so that he might hasten to the rear of the church and join the cortege ; then she sank gracefully to her knees , after laying her bouquet on the seat beside her . Her bracelets tinkled pleasantly as she crossed herself . She knelt for some moments , and this position afforded an excellent view of her flawless profile and equally flawless figure . Finally she rose and , picking up her flowers again , turned in the direction of the aisle , just as the archbishop emerged from the sacristy and the organist began the march from " Le Prophete . " " What an entrance ! " a cousin of the Vincents ' , who was seated slightly to the rear , whispered to his wife . " If you ask me , Savoie 's wife has stolen the show . " " I did n't ask you , " she answered in an annoyed undertone . " If you ask me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making herself  | so conspicuous at another girl 's wedding ! Even if it had n't been for her condition ? " " No one would have known about her condition if a lot of old wives did n't seem to think it necessary to shout it from the housetops . As for being conspicuous , a girl with looks like that ca n't help it . She 'd stand out in any crowd . I do n't wonder she 's been such a belle , ever since she let down her skirts and put up her hair . " He was not able to say any more , at the moment , because the cortege was already halfway up the aisle ; his wife was nudging him and various other women were casting venomous glances in his direction . For the most part , they had not been able to hear his words distinctly ; but they had experienced no difficulty in getting the drift of his remarks and they resented it , just as his wife did . The jealous old harpies , he said to himself , resolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on her when she would not be gliding past him so rapidly that he could hardly get a good look at her . But he found it more difficult than he had foreseen to carry out his resolution . A number of other gentlemen had apparently been inspired by the same idea , as they watched her progress up the aisle , and he found her already surrounded , the center of a convivial group which was sipping champagne and nibbling at petits pdtes aux huitres and squares of massepain . Cary had a champagne glass in her hand , and every other moment or so was raising it to acknowledge a toast ; whenever she did so , she made some witty little remark or one that gave the effect of being witty because of the arch , amusing way in which she said it . The Vincents ' cousin tried hard to catch her eyes and succeeded  --  all too briefly ; Cary smiled at him and raised her glass and made one of her droll little speeches . The newcomer felt very much encouraged ; but almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently he decided it was no use , this was the way things were going to be as long as the reception lasted ... . As he turned away , he was rewarded by a tidbit of gossip which he had not previously heard , and which temporarily did something to compensate for his disappointment , as far as Cary was concerned . It had leaked out that in spite of all its glittering appearances , the wedding had not been a complete success from the viewpoint of either the groom or his father . The old marquis had hoped very much that his daughter would let bygones be bygones and attend her brother 's wedding with her husband and their two girls . His daughter ! But surely Pierre was an only child ! Yes , the only child of a second marriage . But it seemed the old marquis had been married before , to the Princess Asceline de Herbemont , who had died when her baby girl , whose name was also Asceline , was only a few weeks old . So , as the widower did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dead wife 's parents had taken charge of the poor little thing and  | she had remained with them at their chateau in northern Indre . They had regarded their son-in-law 's second marriage as a mesalliance , and had never forgiven him for contracting it . On the other hand , his delight over the birth of Pierre had been so great that he had made no immediate effort to regain possession of his daughter ; and the present marquise had said quite frankly that she did not want to be saddled with a half-grown stepdaughter , or to be snubbed by some decadent old aristocrats who imagined themselves to be better than she was . So matters had drifted along : little Asceline had never gone back to Monteregard as a child or a young girl ; and , eventually , she herself had married , a certain Etienne d'Ambly , who also possessed a very fine chateau . After her marriage , she had been respectful to her father , agreeable to her half-brother and civil to her stepmother when they met by chance in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her own fine establishment in Morbihan . Doubtless she had so often heard them disparaged that she had ended by believing it would be better if the estrangement , already of such duration , should be prolonged indefinitely . Tardily , the old marquis had tried to bring about a rapprochement ; now that it was too late , he realized how much he wanted the companionship of his daughter and how greatly his granddaughter might have contributed to the happiness of his declining years . Moreover , Pierre was very proud of his sister 's aristocratic connections and superb property . He had done everything he could to persuade her that their father needed her ; and all he could do was write a letter , was n't it , to convince her that she and her family should come to his wedding . However , all his efforts had been in vain ; the princess had sent Armande a correct note and a handsome gift ; but she had remained quite unmoved by the pleas that her attendance would add prestige to the marriage ceremony . The Vincents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , relished the flavorsome gossip to the full ; but it did not prevent him from hankering for a chat with Cary , and he lingered in her vicinity , hoping for better luck than he had had before . However , he seemed doomed to disappointment , for eventually Savoie came up and said that Armande was ready to cut the cake and wanted Cary to be there when this was done . She linked her arm through his and went off with him , calling something back over her shoulder which the Vincents ' cousin did not quite catch , but which he gathered was very gay , like everything else she had said , and perhaps the least bit risque , too , from the way it was received by those who did hear it . He also wanted to see the cake cut , so he wedged his way into the dining room ; but it was very crowded , and he could not get anywhere near the table himself , though he could catch a glimpse of Cary , for her yellow satin dress and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in white mousseline de soie , with wreaths of white roses on their  | heads . Some of the " half veils " were torn now , and some of the wreaths were askew , and the general effect was not as ethereal as it had been in the cathedral ; even the bride , upon closer inspection , was not such a dazzling figure as he had previously thought . Of course , since he was a Vincent , he had a feeling of pride in her rose point ? no other New Orleans family owned so much of it ; and as he happened to be something of a lapidary , in an amateur way , he could appreciate the value of the diamond parure  --  it was seldom indeed that the groom 's present to the bride included a tiara as well as a necklace , a brooch , earrings and bracelets . But the truth was that rose point in such immense quantities lost its light , lacy look , and that a seven-piece parure was also too much of a good thing . The radiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . It gave luster to all its surroundings . And then suddenly the luster was gone , for Cary had disappeared ... . It was Savoie who persuaded her to slip away unobtrusively and to go back to the St. Charles , without waiting for the bride and groom to take their departure . Neither her mother nor her stepfather made any effort to hurry her , though when she complied , pleasantly , with Savoie 's anxious advice , Lucy returned to the hotel with her and helped her undress . The bodice of the yellow satin , which fastened down the back with large hooks and eyes , was lined with stiff taffeta , rigidly ribbed with whalebone inside , and was kept in place , over the binding of the separate skirt , by a two-inch waistband of strong webbing , which fitted very snugly and which was also secured by hooks and eyes . As Lucy managed , with an effort , to undo the last of these fastenings , she peeled the bodice away from the corset cover which concealed the " straight front " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wo n't be but a minute now , darling . Start undoing your corset cover yourself . " Obediently , Cary untied the pink bow of the baby ribbon run through the eyelet embroidery which formed the border of the corset cover and started on the buttons which went from the bow at her bosom to the waistline . Meanwhile , Lucy had unhooked the skirt of the yellow satin , and Cary had stepped out of it , so that her mother could lay it over the back of the chair where the bodice had already been tossed . After that , there were the strings to four starched petticoats to untie . But at last Cary stood clad only in chemise , corset and ruffled drawers . " I 'll cut the lacing , darling . It 'll be quicker . " " No , do n't . I 'll take my drawers off , too , if you do n't mind . Then I can unclasp the corset all right . " The drawers fastened with a string , too . This was tied in a hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But finally the  | frilled drawers dropped to the floor . Never , since she was a little girl , except during her recent period of invalidism , when Lucy had been obliged to bathe her , had Cary 's mother seen her daughter as nearly nude as she was now , and to both of them , the exposure of her thighs resulted in self-consciousness . To lessen this , they simultaneously endeavored to unclasp the corset . Just as they succeeded in doing so , Cary fell to the floor in a dead faint . " Naturally , the corset was much too tight for her , " Lucy told Clyde , when he came back to the hotel , several hours later . In accordance with the wishes which both Cary and Lucy had expressed , he had remained at the wedding reception until after Pierre and Armande had taken their gay departure , in a shower of rice and confetti . " That webbing belt , too . . . . If dresses could only be made in one piece ! Perhaps they will be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clyde answered abruptly . He crossed the floor and opened the door which separated his room and Lucy 's from the one which Savoie and Cary were occupying . He knew that Cary would be alone , for Savoie was still at the reception , discussing with his parents the great success of the wedding and sipping one last glass of champagne , when he , Clyde , had left it . Clyde thought that , possibly , Cary might still be awake , that he might have a chance to talk with her . But she had sunk into the profound sleep of complete exhaustion , and lay with her head cradled on her arm and her golden hair bright against her pillows . He closed the door noiselessly and turned back to Lucy . " She wo n't have to wear those tight , stiff clothes again until after her baby 's born , will she ? " he asked . Then , without waiting for an answer , he added , " But I tell you , Lucy , it was one of the proudest moments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aisle of the cathedral in that gold satin dress . " " I know it was , " Lucy replied . And neither of them suggested that the tight corset might not have been the only reason for Cary 's fainting fit . CHAPTER XII THE LATTER part of Cary 's pregnancy proved as painless and pleasant as the first part had proved troublesome and trying . True to her mother 's prediction , none of its distressing symptoms lasted beyond the quickening , and most of them had ceased to cause her much dis-  | comfort before then . She carried her child well , with almost no real disfigurement until she was near her time ; up to then she merely appeared heavier than before and the added weight was not unbecoming . Her color was good , her expression cheerful and the charm of her manner had never been so marked ; if it lacked a little of its former sprightliness , it had also gained in gentleness and grace ; and if her step was less light and rapid , her carriage had more dignity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was growing more like her mother every day ; and though Lucy , when he said the same thing to her , answered a little sorrowfully that she had never qualified for the comparison , he retorted that he was talking about mental and spiritual attributes , not physical ones . Meanwhile , however , Savoie 's adoration was permeated with anxiety . He kept meeting men whose wives ' accouchements had been accompanied by horrors which they described in great detail , or who had actually died in childbirth ; the thought that Cary might suffer such anguish and that he would be responsible for it  --  the fear that he might altogether lose her  --  haunted his days and nights . When her pains began , Dr. Bringier 's assurances that everything was proceeding satisfactorily , and that a rather slow labor was often really preferable , in the case of a first child , to one that was more rapid , only served to infuriate the tormented husband . " Why do n't you do something for her ? Once in three hours you come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased about something and say , Everything is perfectly normal and I think that in about three hours more . . . . ' I sit here with my eyes glued to the clock , and when the three hours are up , you come out here and say the same thing over again ! Do n't talk to me about a first child ! I tell you this is going to be an only child ! I would n't have Cary go through this again for anything in the world ! " The doctor turned away with a slight smile , but refrained from making the answer which , twenty years earlier , had been his stock reply under such circumstances . He glanced toward Clyde , expecting that the older man would return his look in kind ; but Clyde , though he refrained from expostulation , was obviously quite as wretched as Savoie . He 's telling himself , for the first time , he 's glad his wife never had a child by him , the doctor thought sagely . Nothing will ever convince him that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she could have given him a son . His train of thought was intci rupted by a muffled cry which , though quickly smothered , reached the room where they were sitting . Savoie bounded from his seat . " Ca n't you give her chloroform ? Ca n't you put an end to tlt.0 torture by taking the baby with instruments ? " " Yes , of course I can give her chloroform , and I will , by and by  | In whiffs , when she 's further along and really needs it . But I 'm not going to until she does  --  it would simply slow things up . And of course I could use instruments . But I 'm not going to risk tearing her to pieces and injuring the child unless and until I 'm sure she ca n't et her baby into the world herself . And I think she can . I 've told you all a dozen times already that she 's coming along finely . " Ile left the room abruptly , slamming the door after him . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded the two miserable men seated there with compassionate understanding . " I ) r . Bringier tells me he does n't seem able to convince you that everything 's going just as well as possible , " she said . " He thought if I told you I was n't at all worried , it might help to reassure you . And I 'm not . Of course , Cary 's suffering . She has to , you know . But she 's taking it all splendidly , doing just what the doctor tells her to and helping herself along . I think it would be a relief to her , though , if she could scream once in a while without being afraid you 'd hear her . Why do n't you go out in the gazebo for an hour or two ? " " An hour or two ! " Savoie echoed . " An hour or two more ? " " I should think it would be at least that long , " Lucy said calmly . " She was n't in her second stage when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you mean , her second stage ? " " I think perhaps I 'd better let Dr. Bringier explain to you , later on , if you do n't know . You may go in and see her for a minute , if you want to , but I really believe ? " " Of course I want to go in and see her . I 'll probably never see her alive again . " Savoie rushed out of the room , slamming the door even harder than the doctor . Lucy put her arm around her husband 's shoulder . " Do get him outside . I do n't suppose you could persuade him to play cribbage , or chess , or do anything except worry and rage , but if you could it would be the best thing in the world for him . " " I do n't see how I could do anything like that myself , but I 'll try , if you think I ought to . " " I do think so . Thank you , darling . " She lingered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . Then she left , not hastily and noisily , as the others had done , but in her usual serene way . Clyde , making a determined effort , pulled himself together and , after a little rummaging , found a crib and some cards , a chessboard and some chessmen , and carried them out to the gazebo , where he laid them down on one of the seats while he returned for a table . Next , he went to the kitchen , where he found the entire household staff gathered together in a state of idle but gloating expectancy , the enjoyment of which was enhanced , rather than lessened , by the consciousness of Cary 's prolonged travail . Somewhat  | curtly , he ordered drinks and sandwiches brought to the gazebo , adding that Dr. Bringier and Mrs. Batchelor might be calling for coffee at any time , and that he hoped it was not necessary to say there should be broth on the stove and custard in the cooler . Then he went back to the gazebo . When Savoie rejoined him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up , the chessmen in place and the drinks already poured . " Here you are , " he said , handing his son-in-law a glass whose alcoholic content was practically undiluted . " When you 've swallowed that , see if you ca n't beat me , for once in your life . Want to bet on it ? And want to bet that Lucy 'll be bringing us good news before we 've finished the game ? " Savoie did not want to bet , he did not want to play either chess or cribbage , he did not even want to drink ; in fact , his hand shook so that he could hardly hold the glass . But somehow , Clyde managed to prevail . When Lucy finally came to them , they did not hear her light step until she was halfway across the garden . But as they leaped to their feet , upsetting the table and spilling and scattering everything on it in their haste , she called out to them in a glad voice . " A beautiful big boy ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show her baby to you herself or I 'd have brought him with me . " Lucy had not exaggerated in her joy ; the baby was undoubtedly a fine specimen and Cary a radiant mother ; instead of being exhausted by the ordeal through which she had so triumphantly passed , she seemed exhilarated . To be sure , once she had proudly displayed the newborn child , lying in the curve of her arm , to her husband and father , she had fallen into a deep , profound slumber which lasted so long that Savoie , hovering entranced near her bedside , became impatient for her awakening . He felt he could not wait to tell her that he adored her and that she had made him the happiest of men . It did not matter that he had told her this countless times already ; that was before she had made his happiness complete , for he worshiped her now as the mother of his son . Words would be lacking to express all this , yet he yearned to try ; when she finally opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only stammer out his rapture . He had supposed she would seem very fragile to him for a long time , he had feared that he would hardly dare to touch her , and that even if he did dare , he should not , because she would still be very weak and very resentful , since he had been the cause of all her suffering . He thought he must be very gentle and very patient . But as she lay in bed , with her golden hair spread out over her white pillows and the baby at her full , beautiful breast , she seemed to him more vital , as well as more desirable , than ever before ; there was nothing about her to suggest frailty . It took him days to grasp the fact that childbirth had  | clone her no harm , that , instead , it had given her physical fulfillment , and that far from resenting maternity , she was glorying in it . He felt that some miracle had come to pass when he found that she shared his sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much you owe me ? " she asked him one evening , jestingly . She had made such a rapid recovery that she had dispensed with the monthly nurse ahead of time and begun to train Titine 's sister Tudie to help her with the baby ; and although Dr. Bringier was extremely conservative in such matters , he had not tried to confine her to her room as long as he did most of his patients . He had , however , wrung a promise from her that she would breakfast in bed , rest every afternoon and retire immediately after supper , threatening her with the greatly dreaded " loss of milk " if she did not compromise with custom at least to this extent . She had consented , on the condition that Savoie would sit beside her and chat with her after supper " until a normal bedtime " ? a condition she need hardly have imposed , since he never willingly left her side . " Do n't I owe you just as much as you owe me ? " she went on laughingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what you mean , darling , " he answered , pressing the extended hand fondly . " Well , Larry 's was n't a virgin birth , you know . You had something to do with it , too . " They had agreed to let Clyde name the baby , since he had never had a son of his own , and Clyde , of course , had asked Lucy to make the choice . After some hesitation , she had suggested Lawrence . It did not sound like a Louisiana name , she knew , and she would understand perfectly if , on reflection , Cary and Savoie would rather have one that did . But it had been a name of frequent and important occurrence among the Peytons and the Carys , as it had among the Washingtons . Her favorite brother , the one who had been killed leading a cavalry charge at Manassas , had been the last Lawrence Cary , and he had never had a son of his own , either . There had been a Lawrence Peyton in the Revolution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the first Cary to come to Virginia  --  the one whose bride had been given the diamond brooch by the King of England  --  was named Lawrence , too . She had hoped that she herself ... . Everyone had instantly agreed that Lawrence Cary Vincent would be a perfect name for the new baby and he was baptized , with due pomp and ceremony , in the parish church of St. Michael 's at Convent . The religious ceremony was followed by a large reception at the new Monteregard , during the course of which the baby , clad in robes of ancestral lace , was shown off to a host of admiring beholders . All the guests agreed that this christening was a most auspicious occasion on which to gather friends and relatives together for the first time in the  | newly established home . No one regretted any longer that the proposed housewarming had never taken place . Besides , the present function served a dual purpose : it was not only a christening party , it was a bon voyage party . Mrs. Vincent had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to France to pay Pierre and Armande a long visit ? and , incidentally , they might even visit the Princess d'Ambly , for Armande , with her never-failing tact , had actually succeeded in bringing about the long-desired rapprochement between the two branches of the family , when everyone else had failed . It was really wonderful , nothing short of miraculous . What was more , Armande was " expecting " already , which , Mrs. Vincent kept archly telling everyone who would listen to her , was just what she herself had expected ! She hoped that , once she got her husband away , he would consent to remain abroad for a good long time  --  not only long enough to visit the D'Amblys as well as the De Chanets , but also long enough to attend a French christening . Of course , nothing could be nicer than the one they were celebrating now . Still , with a magnificent private chapel in a historic chateau for a setting  --  well , the next one in the family would be exceptionally thrilling ! Everyone agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the new Monteregard was over , the same persons who had said that Lawrence Cary Vincent was a perfect name for the new baby were also agreeing , over their champagne , that they must find a nickname for him . With comparable unanimity , it was decided what this should be ; so , by the time Cary was jesting with Savoie about his share in producing such a wonderful infant , " Larry " came readily to her lips . She said she had always despised parents who referred to their offspring as " it , " and that parents who merely said " Baby this , Baby that " were almost as bad ; she was very glad the whole question had been taken out of her hands . " I never thought of it that way before , " Savoie told her , in a wondering voice . " That I ought to be grateful ? Or that the baby 's been called by a sensible name from the beginning ? " " That you ought to be grateful to me , of course . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you can be . You had all the pain and I had all the pleasure . " " Oh , Savoie ! It 's beneath you , conversationally and mentally both , to use that old cliche ! Besides , from what Mother 's told me , you did n't enjoy the day Larry was born very much yourself . " " No , but ? " " That 's what you meant when you talked about the pain , is n't it ? As to the pleasure ? " She stopped , looking up at him with sparkling eyes . " I was terribly slow about making up my mind to get married ,  | was n't I ? " she asked . " Perhaps I was a little slow about grasping all the advantages of the married state , too . I 'm sorry . " " 1 was n't reproaching you , darling . I just said I knew ? " " Well , I would n't blame you if you did reproach me . But you wo n't have a chance to reproach me any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm determined to make up for lost time . " 1 le was still holding the hand she had stretched out to him . He pressed it again and raised it to his lips . " Do n't you think you might give me a real kiss ? You have n't , you know , since Larry was born . " " Why yes I have ! I 've kissed you every day  --  several times a day . " " Not the way I 'm talking about . " I le rose and looked down at her . Never had he seen such welcome in her face and , as he bent over and kissed her , he could feel the welcome in her lips , too . He straightened up again , swiftly . " It 's  --  it 's too soon , " he said thickly . " Is it ? Do you really think so ? I should have supposed you would think it was n't half soon enough , " she answered . " I mean , if  --  if anything should happen . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her again and seeing the way she looked at him , he forgot he had meant to be very patient and very gentle and remembered only how much he wanted her . Well , yes , Dr. Bringier conceded dryly , when , rather shamefacedly , Savoie sent for him again ; it was sooner than he would have advised , if he had been consulted . But it was no sooner than he had anticipated . I le had been expecting to be called in , about this time , ever since Savoie had raved and ranted about an only child ; he had never known that to fail . He would have liked to see Cary nurse Larry through the following summer ; but the baby was in such splendid condition that it would do him no harm to shift gradually to cow 's milk . As for Cary , it was obvious that she was made for maternity . She was in a very different mood than before , was n't she ? Yes , that was what he would have thought . And he doubted whether she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for her confinement , she would probably just kick off her slippers and have the baby . He would tell her so , since he might not even get there himself ; but now perhaps he had better be getting in and looking her over ... . There was no question at all about the different mood . When Cary said she was very glad she was going to have another baby , she did so in such a way that the doctor could not possibly doubt that she meant it . Indeed , when she added , quite spontaneously , that she hoped she would have a very large family , he permitted himself the jest of saying it was too bad she had started in so late ; she probably would  | not be able to have more than ten or twelve , unless she had twins ; whereas , if she had married at sixteen , like her mother , she might have had twenty . Cary retorted that , quite likely , there would be twins , sooner or later , possibly more than one set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anything else of the kind , she went on to say that she hoped , this time , she would have a girl , so that she could name it Lucy . She had already told her mother and her stepfather about her prospects and they were pleased , too . They did not think it was too soon for her to have another . Something in her tone seemed to dare the doctor to say again that he thought so and he did not accept the dare . He was really very fond of them all and he was glad they were all so happy . It was not his policy to pry into the private affairs of his patients ; but , like most family physicians , he could not help learning a good deal about these . He knew , for instance , that Clyde had suffered great financial reverses after fighting his way to a fortune and that Lucy had endured many trials with great fortitude ; he knew that Cary had been a spoiled child and that , besides causing her parents considerable anxiety , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Savoie was as fine a fellow as ever lived , even if he were not overburdened with brains . But Cary was settling down at last ; she was proving to be a good daughter and a good wife and a good mother after all ; there was not a family the doctor knew on the river road more deserving of happiness or with a better prospect of it . And then Savoie came galloping up to Dr. Bringier 's house late one night , when the exhausted physician had finally sunk into bed after a long , hard day , and implored him to come posthaste to Monteregard . Larry , who had never been sick for a single hour , had suddenly been smitten with some strange and terrible illness . Mrs. Surget , who was visiting them , had said at first that it was only croup , and Tudie had agreed with her . They had fired a kettle of water on a small oilstove , under a blanket , so that the steam would envelop the baby in his crib , and had prophesied that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's breathing had become more and more labored . Then Mrs. Surget had begun to talk about membranous croup , and had admitted steam would not loosen that . Tudie had not said anything more ; she had put her apron over her head and groaned . Now the poor baby seemed to be strangling ... . While Savoie rattled distractedly on and on , Dr. Bringier had been flinging himself into his clothes . He did not underestimate the gravity of the situation . Unless there were apparently a question of life or death , no Creole planter would have come pounding up the river road himself to summon a doctor , instead of sending one of his servants ; and even allowing for Savoie 's constitutional excitability and natural anxiety , the symptoms he described were unquestionably alarming .  | " Sulie 's hitching up the buggy right now , " the doctor said , shrugsing himself into his coat and abruptly interrupting Savoie 's torrent of talk . " I 'll be at Monteregard almost as soon as you can get back there yourself . Meanwhile , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go home and let Cary know I 'm on my way . I tell you frankly I 'm afraid , from what you say , your baby is bad off . But do n't repeat that , you hear ? Membranous croup ? Bah ! There is no such thing ! DiphIberia , more likely . A killer . But do n't repeat that either . After all , I 've nothing to go on as yet but your incoherencies . Now hurry along . You 're doing no good here . " Larry was still hooded in Mrs. Surget 's improvised steam tent when the physician entered the nursery and , bending over him , curtly ordered the hissing kettle and the small oilstove removed . The baby 's face was purple , his lips blue , his struggle for breath already nearly futile . Only an occasional wheezing rattle showed that he had managed to suck a bit of air into his straining lungs . " As I thought , " Dr. Bringier announced tersely . " Diphtheria . No use wasting time on medication . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a cut in his throat and inserting a tube . If I can do that quickly enough . . . . If not .... " He did not finish the sentence . Cary buried her face against Savoie 's shoulder to smother a wild surge of sobs . Beneath the damp fabric of his shirt , she could feel the trembling of his body ; and suddenly she knew she could not count on him for support in this dreadful moment . Instead , she must somehow summon strength to meet it unaided . " No time to lose , " she heard the doctor saying as she raised her head . " First , let 's get this table cleared  --  and be quick about it ! Now , Mrs. Surget , you and Tudie go back to the kitchen and stay there until I send for you . Meanwhile , put some water on to boil . " Then , when the old family friend and the young colored mammy had tiptoed obediently from the room , with fearful backward glances toward the crib and the baby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but I could n't risk Larry 's life with either of them . I 've got to have intelligent co-operation . One of you 'll have to give it to me . " While he was speaking , he dragged the marble-topped center table nearer the mantel and speedily transferred the two lamps which stood on the dresser to the mantel shelf . " Got to have light , too , " he grumbled . " And I ca n't afford to take a chance of having either of you keel over , maybe , with a lighted lamp in your hand , at the sight of a little blood . " " Blood ! " echoed Savoie . " Larry 's blood ! Oh , my God ! " " Tais-toi ! " the doctor exclaimed sharply , as if he had been speaking to a troublesome child . " You can go to pieces later on , if you have to ,  | Savoie . For the moment , your son 's life may depend on your selfcontrol . " He had continued to work quickly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered the table . Another , folded and refolded into a narrow pad , was placed near one end of it . Shiny instruments rattled and clinked as they were laid out . When all were in readiness , the doctor detached his stiffly starched cuffs from his shirt and rolled up his sleeves as he walked toward the bathroom . Cary and Savoie could hear him moving about there , running the water and scrubbing his hands . But the sounds seemed distant and meaningless . They were drowned by the agonized stertor of Larry 's gasping , which went on and on . Until then , Dr. Bringier had acted with almost unbelievable rapidity ; now , the suffering baby 's parents felt that he was not acting at all and Savoie impulsively started toward the bathroom himself , thereby blocking the path of the returning physician . He jerked his head , motioning Savoie out of his way and , lifting Larry from the crib , placed him on the table in such a manner as to bring the narrow pad beneath his shoulders and permit the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin myself , but one of you 'll have to hold his arms against the table , " Dr. Bringier announced . " I expect it 'd better be you , Savoie . After all , you 're a good deal stronger than Cary . Remember that the child 's got to be still while I cut . Pin his shoulders down tight . If he jerked , I might not be able to help hurting him ? bad , I mean . " Savoie approached the lighted table , bent forward and placed his corded hands over the baby 's soft little arms . But he was still shaking , and suddenly he released his grip , swayed backward and crumpled in a heap beside the table , while deep racking sobs came from him . " Oh , Jesus God ! I ca n't do it ! " he cried . " A knife in that baby 's throat ! No ! No ! " Dr. Bringier looked past him contemptuously and saw that Cary was already close to him , placing a steadying hand on his bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said soothingly . " Do n't worry . I know how you feel . But I can keep him quiet . I 've done it lots of times already . " She took hold of the strangling baby 's arms and pinioned them to the table . " Go ahead , Dr. Bringier , " she said , still composedly . " Everything will be all right . Only please hurry . " She looked down at her child , marveling at the strength he showed in trying to escape her . She did not see Savoie , who had somehow got to his feet and stepped out of the way . She did not see Mrs. Surget and Tudie , who had crept back as far as the dark doorway , and stood , with their hands pressed hard against their lips , staring in horrified fascination at the lamplit scene by the mantel . But she saw the doctor 's clean , gnarled fingers press Larry 's chin up and back , and a dazzling gleam of light from a polished blade . Then she saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke . She saw a hand pull back the slipping edges of the wound , probe briefly at the pulsing tissues beneath , and finally drive the blade down and back ... . She saw no more , because she felt as if she were commencing to spin in a slow vortex , and she stopped looking down at Larry and pressed her eyelids together as though Larry 's life depended now upon her sightlessness  --  as indeed she feared it did . Dimly , though unquestioningly , she realized that as long as the pulsing red wound and the gnarled fingers which probed it and the gleaming knife above it remained invisible , she could hold on . So she did not see a polished tube worked through the incision , or a smaller tube deftly adjusted within it . At last she heard a voice saying , " Just a minute longer . This is what is going to tell the tale . " But still she did not open her eyes , lest nameless horror should engulf her and sweep her away to some remote region where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny , flickering life ... . Then , abruptly , Larry 's tortured gasps and his pitiful writhing ceased at the same instant , and someone was speaking again , saying she did not need to hold the baby any longer , and someone had put an arm around her ... . She did not instantly recognize the voice as the doctor 's , because it was not harsh any more , but very , very gentle ; and she did not instantly realize that it was Savoie who was embracing her , because the arm which encircled her was steady and not trembling . But she dared to look at last and , through a blur of unshed tears , she saw a glint of metal at her baby 's white throat , just at the place where she had so often nuzzled it to make him gurgle with laughter . She rubbed her eyes to make sure that this and everything else she saw was not a delusion . For the baby 's face had lost its deadly purplish cast and was pink and warmly alive again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; instead his small breast rose and fell in the peaceful rhythm of effortless breathing , and his eyes were closed in deep natural slumber ... . " You ca n't blame him for dropping off , either , " Dr. Bringier chuckled , shooting his cuffs over his knuckles and snapping the steel fasteners into his shirt sleeves . " I expect he 's been through more than he 'll ever be called on to undergo again . At least , I hope so . But he 's still going to need a great deal of attention right around the clock . And , judging by what happened here a little while ago , I 'm afraid you 're the only one that can give it to him , Cary . But I know now I can count on you . " The doctor had begun to move the miscellany of bright metal from the table and stow it back into his black leather bag , item by item . In the course of this process , he selected a short , shining tube and held it up for Cary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all .  | " Here 's a twin to the one your baby 's breathing through now , " he explained . " The upper part of his throat is still closed by the false membrane . So , naturally , he ca n't cough to clear his breathing passages of secretion . You 'll have to do the clearing for him during the next ten days . A breathing tube like this is inside a larger one that will stay in his throat until he 's well . That 's so the small tube can be changed without hurting him , since it touches only the larger tube , not the baby himself . When you can tell from his breathing that the passage is getting clogged with secretion , take out the small one and put this one in . I 'll show you how it 's done before I leave . Then clean the old tube thoroughly and use it to make the next exchange . Larry wo n't mind . Matter of fact , it 's so much less effort to breathe through a tube than through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take out everything , we 'll first have to block the tube partially for a day and then shut it off altogether for another day . By that time he 'll be using his own natural air passages again and we can remove all this hardware and let his throat heal . There wo n't even be much of a scar ... . Now , if Mrs. Surget and Tudie really did put water on to boil , how 's for dripping some of it through a coffeepot ? I think we could all do with a drink . " For more than a week , Cary watched over Larry night and day , ministering to his every need . Not once , during this interval , did she complain of morning sickness or dizziness , though it was obvious enough she suffered from both , nor did she refer in any way to her own condition . Then , when the silver tubes had been painlessly removed , and Larry was well on the road to complete recovery , she suddenly fainted dead away , for the only time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wedding . Savoie carried her to bed and undressed her ; and when she struggled back to consciousness and instinctively tried to rise , she realized that it was her physician and not her husband who was sitting beside her , and that the fingers on her wrist were there to feel her pulse and not to caress her . " Lie still , Cary , " Dr. Bringier said abruptly ; and , as she continued her vain effort to sit up , he added , more sternly , " Larry 's pulled through and it 's thanks to your care , even more than his fine physique . But you 've got to turn him over to someone else now . " " There is n't anyone else . You 've said yourself , over and , over again , that Tudie was developing into a fine nurse , for a well child , but that she did n't have enough experience yet to take care of a sick one . And none of the other servants ? " " True enough . But ? " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age and show it , too , so much that you did n't ? " " That 's also correct , but ? "  | " Well , then ? " " Will you kindly let me finish what I started to say , Cary Vincent ? There 's your mother . She 's as good a nurse as I ever saw . She has a natural gift for it and she 's had plenty of experience besides . Instead of just letting her spell you , for an hour or two at a time as she has been doing , you 'll have to let her take Larry at night , from now on . " " You mean send him to Cindy Lou ! " " Certainly not . I 'm not proposing to move him . He 's out of danger and I think he 'll make a rapid recovery ; children go downhill fast , but they have remarkable powers of recuperation . However , though it 's no longer necessary that anyone should sit up all night with him , he still requires considerable care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , I can . " " I 'm telling you that you ca n't . You might faint again  --  at a very had moment , not just for you , but for Larry . And you 've got another child to think of now . You want this new baby  --  it means more to you than Larry did , before he was born . It would be a hard blow to you if you lost it . And I 'm telling you that you very well may , if you go on as you have been doing . What 's more , if you lost this one , you might never have another  --  do n't forget what happened in your mother 's case . And then what would become of that big family of yours , I 'd like to know ? " The latter part of the doctor 's speech sounded less severe than the first ; there was even an obvious attempt to introduce a mildly jesting note . But this superficial lightness in no way obscured the underlying gravity . Cary sank back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Both Savoie and Tudie . Mrs. Surget 's in the house , too . She 's still able to help another nurse , for a few hours at a stretch , in the daytime . But you 're right ; I ca n't give her any more night nursing . " " Mother is n't here ? " " No . Larry 's sleeping peacefully , so she went back to Cindy Lou to have dinner with your father . I told her I 'd stay with you until she got back , that I wanted to talk to you like a Dutch uncle , without any interference . And I know she thinks your father needs her , too  --  he 's got his hands pretty full with the spring crop , what with Lamartine Vincent gallivanting around France and Savoie refusing to stir out of this house . And I believe he 's expecting some business visitor , due to arrive at any moment . But I 'm going straight from here to Cindy Lou myself on purpose to ask your mother to come back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through talking to you  --  I promised her I would . I 'll also tell her she must be prepared to stay overnight ? over several nights . But first , I want you to promise me you wo n't get out of that bed , except to nurse Larry , until I give you permission . You 'll find you wo n't be able to satisfy him anyhow , when he 's well  | enough to be a little hungrier . I 'm thankful we got him started on cow 's milk before all this happened , because your supply will have to be materially supplemented from now on . Even if you had n't worn yourself out , you would n't have had enough for him much longer . So let your mother start feeding him at night . I 'm telling you the truth , Cary . It 's not just a question of what 's best for you ; it 's also a question of what 's best for Larry  --  and for the new baby . " He had hard work wringing the promise from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly , and added both his assurances of Larry 's continued and peaceful slumber to those of the doctor , that she agreed to stay where she was , at least until the baby wakened and cried for her . Before that happened , her mother arrived , and proved more successful than either of the others in coping with Cary . Lucy had never enlarged , before , on the poignancy of her disappointment in her failure to give Clyde a child ; but she did this now , and in a way so infinitely moving that Cary could not keep back the tears while she lay listening to her mother ; and , as she was quietly weeping , her thoughts turned more and more to those children , still unborn , who would be the outward and visible sign of her fulfillment as a woman and of her triumph as a wife . Gradually , a fierce desire to safeguard the future flooded her being and helped her to forget her anxiety of the present . " Anyway , you and Father have had each other , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequately and believing that she was also speaking inconsequentially . " Yes . We 've had each other , " Lucy said . And , brief as the answer was , its adequacy was complete . " Did he mind too much , having you leave ? " " Oh , no ! He agreed with Dr. Bringier that I should . But he wanted to come with me . I had hard work dissuading him . However , Valois Dupre has just arrived at Cindy Lou  --  he was to be in Baton Rouge tomorrow and , apparently , it 's very important that he and your father should have some sort of a consultation before then . Besides , there 's no reason why your father 's rest should be disturbed because Larry needs care  --  he could n't help anyway . An aptitude for nursing is not among his many talents . " She rose . " I think I will go to the nursery now , " she went on . " If Larry finds me beside him when he wakes , he will be less likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me now and we are pretty good friends , too . If he seems contented and comfortable , I will send Savoie in to you and keep Tudie to wait on me . Please believe me , darling , Larry will be all right . " " I do believe you , Mother . And thanks for talking to me the way you did . It helped a lot . I promise you I wo n't try to get up . I 'll lie still and take good care of little Lucy while you 're taking care of Larry . " They kissed and clung to each other for a moment ; then Lucy left  | the room and , for a little while , Cary lay quietly , thinking less of the sick child , with whom she had been so wholly preoccupied during the last few days , than of the new life within her , of her husband 's overwhelming love for her , and of the tardy quickening of her own response to him , which had already transfigured their marriage relationship , and which gave such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more fortunate she was than her mother had been ! It was true that Lucy and Clyde had been ideally happy together ; but Cary realized now that this happiness had never been quite complete and , with thankful wonder , she told herself that hers was  --  or that it would be , as soon as she was sure , beyond any shadow of a doubt , that all was well with Larry . When Savoie came back to their room from the nursery , an hour later , he was able to give her this assurance . Larry had not cried at all when he wakened ; he had indeed recognized his grandmother ? the precocious intelligence of that child ! ? and had been glad to see her ; he had even drunk the milk she offered him , with apparent relish . Then he had dropped peacefully off to sleep again . Mrs. Batchelor had almost completed arrangements for the night . Tudie had brought in more milk , which had been put in the beautiful veilleuse Mrs. Surget had given Larry for a christening present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he could have more whenever he was hungry . Now Mrs. Batchelor had packed Tudie off to bed , telling her to get a good night 's rest , and was herself preparing to retire . She sent her love to Cary , and promised to let her know instantly if Larry should take a turn for the worse ; but she confidently expected him to keep on feeling better . " And I think so , too , " Savoie concluded hopefully . " So there 's not a thing on earth for you to worry about , darling . " " No , I do n't believe there is . " She was beginning to feel sleepy herself . She had fought off the drowsiness natural to her condition all the time she had watched beside Larry . Now she could succumb to it . The sensation was delicious . " Can I get you anything ? Is there anything you want ? " " You ca n't get me anything and the only thing I want is to know you 're here with me . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Very nearly . We can call it bedtime if you want to . " " I do want to . For over a week ? " For over a week their every thought had been of Larry . Now at last they could think of each other again . They went to sleep in each other 's arms . In the nursery wing , on the other side of the house , Lucy remained wakeful for some time . She had spoken the truth when she said she  | felt there was no further cause for anxiety ; still , to make assurance doubly sure , she sat beside Larry for more than an hour , listening to his breathing and occasionally feeling his forehead . His breath came softly and regularly , his forehead was faintly moist under his clustering curls . The awful periods of strangulation were over , the burning fever had completely subsided . There was no doubt now that he would sleep peacefully for hours . Besides , his crib was drawn up close to the big bed ; she would hear his slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any longer ; in fact , it would be much better if she , too , rested as long as possible , so that she would be refreshed the next day . She prepared for the night in her customary , calm , orderly way , hanging up her dress , folding her underwear over the back of a chair , brushing and braiding her long hair and sponging herself off , before slipping into her clean cambric nightgown . Then she knelt down to say the Lord 's Prayer , adding to this her more personal petitions for those who were nearest and dearest to her ; she gave thanks for Larry 's recovery from mortal illness , for her daughter 's growth in grace , for her husband 's devotion , for everything good that had come into her life ; and she did not fail to add a plea for a return to the fold by Bushrod , the black sheep . Finally she rose from her knees and , after one last look at Larry , blew out the lamp and lay down in bed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shed its soft light over the slumbering child . She did not fall asleep instantly . She had always been sensitive to her surroundings and , aside from her feeling of responsibility , she had a feeling of strangeness . She had never occupied this room before , at night , and it was a long while since she and Clyde had been separated . In the early days of their marriage , she had not always been able to accompany him when he traveled on business , because she could not leave Cary ; but ever since all his interests had been concentrated at Cindy Lou , she and he had been together almost constantly . She thought of him , alone , too , and knew that he must have the same feeling of strangeness that she did , and the same feeling of isolation . She forced herself to lie quiet and relaxed , instead of following her impulse to toss restlessly from side to side , or to become tense under the strain of solitude . She prayed again , short , formless little prayers this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her elbow and looked down at Larry , to find that he had not stirred since she last looked at him . Finally , soothed by the beneficent stillness of the night , she slept . When a slight , sudden puff of wind upset the veilleuse , she did not hear its soft fall . The sound was muffled by the silken scarf covering the chest where it had stood and it did not tumble to the floor . But the milk from its little pot and the oil from its lamp flowed out of it together , and on top of the oil floated the tiny lighted wick .  | A second gust of wind sent the burning oil farther on its wicked way , setting fire to its surroundings . Lucy never knew whether it was the sound of a banging shutter or a sudden scream from Larry which wakened her . The two came together , and she leaped from her bed into a room already ablaze , realizing with horror that there was not a second to lose . The first little licking flames from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had quickly reached the draperies . Escape through the dressing room was already cut off , for the curtain which hung at the doorway was afire . Lucy snatched the screaming child from his cradle , enveloped him in a blanket and rushed toward the door leading to the rear stairway . By this time , the sudden windstorm had reached the proportions of a gale , and it was all she could do to battle her way across the garden . She did not dare lay Larry down on the cold ground ; but once she had reached the gazebo , he would have shelter from the storm , inadequate to be sure , but enough to serve until she could summon more help . She had not paused , even to put on slippers , and , in the darkness , she could not choose her path . She kept stumbling , and once she fell ; but she struggled to her feet again , unconscious of any hurt , and hurried on . Though her first dazed , waking thought had naturally been for Larry , she realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warn the others . Again , there was not a second to lose . Her foot touched the step leading into the gazebo before she saw it . Wrapping the blanket more firmly around the still-screaming baby , she laid him on the floor ; and , as she did so , she tried to murmur a few words of comfort . But she did not dare stay to soothe him , and his pitiful cries followed her as she turned and ran back toward the house . Darkness was no longer a handicap , for the whole nursery wing was now ablaze , and flames had already reached the rear of the building ; but she could see that the great , outer stairway , leading to the main floor , was still clear . Surely she could get up it , battle her way through the hall and reach the wing where Savoie and Cary were sleeping  --  if they still slept . She could only pray that the wind had wakened them , too , that they had already made their way to safety . But , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if Savoie and Cary had come out through the hall , she would already have seen them ; and there was no stairway leading directly from their quarters to the ground . Unless they had leaped from a window , they could not have reached it . And such a leap , for Cary at least , would have been only one degree less dangerous than fire itself . Lucy reached the great , outer stairway , mounted it two steps at a time , and gained the front door . Doors at Cindy Lou were never locked , but Savoie had always followed his father 's custom of bolting everything at night . Desperately , Lucy threw her weight against the  | solid panels ; then , realizing the complete futility of pitting her slender strength against such solid structure , she doubled up her fist and struck one of the glass side windows to the door with all her might . This time , her effort was successful . The blow shattered the glass , and she thrust her hand and arm through the opening and managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers . Then the knob turned easily under her hand and the door opened , releasing clouds of smoke . She stepped across the threshold and ran down the length of the hall , until the smoke stifled her and she fell . CHAPTER XIII IT HAD become second nature for Cary to stretch out her arms toward Savoie as , still deliciously drowsy , she began to nestle around in the morning . He was invariably wide awake already , for he instinctively kept the " planter 's hours " to which he had been accustomed since childhood ; but he was careful to remain completely motionless , until the welcome signs of his wife 's imminent awakening encouraged him to turn toward her . Then he drew her to him , first burying his head in her breast , and then kissing her shoulders , next her throat and lastly her lips . She was naturally a very lazy girl , she was apt to tell him ; however , no amount of somnolence could have been proof against the persuasive powers of that culminating kiss . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full benefit of another like it ... . She was waking now , but it was not a kiss that had roused her and her arms encountered only a strange void as she stretched them out . When she became fully conscious of this , she also became conscious of pain , a pain which was dull rather than poignant ; and there was a strangeness about the dullness , too , as if it were not really part of the pain . It was a little like the dullness that came from the chloroform she had been given when she was in the last stages of labor , merciful but stupefying . Yet , it did not seem quite like chloroform , either ; and of course she was not in labor , it would be months yet before that happened again , and she had been assured that , this time , it would be much easier than before anyway . She was trying to decide what the dull pain could be , still without bothering to open her eyes and still groping aimlessly for Savoie , when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since that was not Savoie 's way , nor his voice which she heard , she reluctantly opened her eyes at last and saw that her  | father was sitting at her bedside . And next , before she could ask him why he was there and why Savoie was not , she realized that she was at Cindy Lou instead of at Monteregard , and that she was lying alone in the little old spool bed that had been hers before she married . " Cary , " Clyde was saying again . " Cary , my darling . . . . " It was Clyde 's voice , there was no doubt of that , yet there was something strange about this , too . Everything was very strange . She ( lid not understand at all . She had always thought with great affection of her own room at Cindy Lou and of the little old spool bed where she had slept alone ; but now that she was back at Cindy Lou , in the spool bed , the strangeness troubled her . She was not happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question her father , but her own voice seemed strangest of all , and the dullness of the pain did not keep it from getting worse , now that she was wider awake . " Monteregard was  --  damaged by fire , during a storm at night , " Clyde was telling her . At least that was what she understood him to say . She was not quite sure , because everything still seemed so strange , and she was so bewildered and suffering so much . " It seemed better for you to come  --  to come home for the present . " " But Savoie did n't stay at Monteregard without me , did he ? " " No . He 's at Cindy Lou , too . But he had to fight the fire , you see . It 's hard work , fighting fires , you know that . So he 's  --  resting now . " " I do n't see why he could n't rest here , beside me . " She did not understand why she should begin to cry . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clyde told her , there was nothing he had said which should cause her grief . Of course it was unfortunate that there had been a fire at Monteregard ; but fires were not infrequent occurrences , in plantation houses , and happily they did not often amount to much . She was sure her father would soon repair any damage that had been done and then she would go back to Monteregard and she and Savoie would be together again . Meanwhile , she ought to be thankful that her old home was so close that she could return to it , in any emergency , thankful that she was in the pleasant room which had been hers for so long , thankful that Savoie was resting comfortably , after having helped to put out the fire . Probably he had been afraid of disturbing her by coming to her room when she had gone to sleep . But how could she have come from Monteregard from Cindy Lou without waking up , without knowing there was a fire ? She tried to puzzle it out , but she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she went to sleep again . When she waked , the pain was worse , but she was able to think more clearly . She began to remember now : she had been sound asleep , after many nights that were  | wakeful , because she had been watching over Larry and . . . . Suddenly , she screamed . " Larry has died ! Larry has died and you have n't told me ! " " No , darling , Larry has n't died . He 's much better  --  completely out of danger . But he 's sound asleep , in Bushrod 's room , and Tudie 's there with him . She 's taken wonderful care of him ever since  --  well , ever since we brought him here . Dr. Bringier says he could n't be in better hands . You do n't want me to wake him up , do you , when he needs sleep so much ? " " I do n't believe he 's all right . I sha n't believe it unless I see him . " " Cary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did I ever lie to you ? " " No , but I do n't understand .... " She must not cry again , she would not . She bit her lips to keep them steady and tried to go on remembering . Yes , she had been sleeping very , very soundly , after her nights of vigil ; and then she had been roused by Savoie , who was shaking her , so that she would wake up ; and the room was full of smoke , so full that it choked him while he tried to talk to her , to tell her that the house was on fire , that she must leave it at once , by a window , and he would go through the wing into the hall and make sure that her mother had left the other wing with Larry , by the steps on the farther side . He was convinced this was what would have happened , but he would go and make sure , as soon as he had seen her safely on the ground . She had tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , and he had told her there was no time to talk ; he had picked her up and carried her to the window . . . . She tried and tried , but she could not remember anything after that . She turned again to her father , who was still sitting quietly beside her , with his head bowed , and this time she did not cry out , and she did not find it so hard to question him , either . " Things are coming back to me , Father . " " I knew they would , if you would n't try to hurry yourself , darling . " " Mother carried Larry straight down the new staircase , did n't she ? " " Yes . That 's just what she did . We ca n't be thankful enough you thought of having it built . " Briefly , Cary was conscious of immense thankfulness herself . But now that she found she could , she wanted to go on asking questions . " Then it was no trouble at all to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your mother took him straight to the gazebo . He was sheltered there from the storm and safe from the fire . " " And what did Mother do next ? " " Well , naturally , after she was sure Larry was safe , she hurried back to warn you and Savoie . " " And I suppose it was while she was hurrying back that the smoke waked Savoie and that he waked me ? " " Yes , that must have been the way it was n  | " He said he would go through the house to make sure Larry and Mother were all right . Probably she and Savoie met in the hall . " " Yes , Cary , they did . " " Then she 's resting now , too ? " " Yes , Cary . " " But what happened to me ? That still is n't clear . " " You were  --  hurt , falling from a window . Perhaps you were unconscious before you fell . You 'd already swallowed a good deal of smoke , more than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you had a slight concussion . We do n't know . It does n't matter anyway . " " But I was unconscious when I was found ? " " Yes . I picked you up myself , I brought you over here . You never stirred until you waked up a few hours ago and asked for Savoie . " " Was that hours ago ? " " Yes , Cary . " " Has anything happened since ? " " Well , Dr. Bringier 's been here to see you again . " " Again ? " " Yes . Of course we sent for him right away . And he gave you something to deaden your pain right away . He 's kept on giving you something . He 'll continue to do so . He  --  we wo n't let you suffer any more than we can help . " So it was medicine that was responsible for that dull feeling , some kind of medicine which was very powerful , even if it were not as powerful as chloroform . But now that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she should still be in so much pain . The pain was there all the time  --  not just when she moved a little . So evidently she had not broken any bones . She did not believe that burns could be causing the pain , either . Like everyone else , she had burnt her fingers , occasionally , and though the burns had been slight , they were unforgettable . The pain she felt now was not like the pain they gave . This was like only one other that she had ever had , not exactly like it , either . But then , the effect of the powerful medicine was not exactly like the effect of chloroform ... . " Father , you do n't mean ? " " I hoped you would n't guess , darling . Try not to grieve too much . Remember you 've got Larry . " " But ? " It was no use . No matter how hard she bit them , she could not keep her lips from trembling now . " But this time I was glad ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And Savoie was so glad , too . And Mother . Mother 'll be terribly worried , Father . You see , she told me to be very careful , because if I had one miscarriage , then probably . . . . She 's been so terribly disappointed herself , Father , because she did n't give you a child . "  | " She did give me a child . She gave you to me . You 're my child , Cary . You always have been . But you 're doubly my child now . " There were tears on her face and they were not her own . And suddenly she understood everything . Everything except that she herself was dying . She was not sure how long it was before she understood that , too , because time meant nothing to her any more . Every now and then Titine or Mrs. Surget came into her room and did things which , apparently , seemed to them necessary . They gave her broth and gruel , and sponged her off with sweet-smelling water and changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministrations with docility , but she never craved their company and she was always secretly relieved to have them go away . Her feeling about her grandmother and her cousin Mildred , who had come down from Virginia and were occupying the room with the convent beds , was more neutral . She did not really crave their company , either ; on the other hand , she was not actually relieved when they left her . She took a certain vague pleasure in their talk of Sorrento , as it was now , and of Amalfi , as it once had been ; but she had no desire to share in this conversation or to expand it . When Tudie brought Larry in to her , early every morning and again just before bedtime , she was glad to see him ; but she did not resent it at all when Dr. Bringier said the baby must not stay with her too long at a time , because it would tire her . She did not feel she needed to see him long at a time to assure herself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that she needed to see , for long , the priest who had married her to Savoie and who had also baptized Larry , or the rector of the little Episcopal church which her mother had faithfully supported , and of which she herself had been a nominal , and rather casual , member . She recognized that they were both good men and that they were both devoted to her personally , besides having her spiritual welfare at heart . She thanked them for coming , but she did not suggest that either should come a second time . They did not add to her sense of peace or her sense of happiness . It was Clyde that she wanted with her . She and he talked to each other freely about everything again now , just as they had before she was married ; and she thought it was when he told her about her mother 's funeral , and her husband 's , that she began to realize he would have no one to talk to in just that way , after she died . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ; but otherwise she was not troubled at all . It did not tire her or make her sad to talk ; on the contrary , it exhilarated her , because she was glad to feel she was giving her father some comfort . She knew he had hesitated to avail himself of this comfort , because he had asked Dr. Bringier if talking would do Cary any harm . He  | had put the question almost in a whisper , when the two had gone out into the hall ; but Cary had heard it , and the doctor 's answer to it . " You 're sure it would n't help if she could conserve her strength ? " " She has n't any strength left to conserve . I 'll keep her as comfortable as I can , with drugs . It 's your job to keep her as happy as you can , in any way that you can . " So Clyde came back into Cary 's room and talked with her until the merciful drugs had done their work and she was drowsy again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead , he paid her the tribute of sharing his sorrow with her . And when he paused , after talking to her about the past , and about her mother , she talked to him about the future , and about Larry . " You said I was your child , Father , and I 'm glad you did , because I 've always felt as if I were . You said Mother gave me to you . Now Larry must be your child . I 'm giving him to you . " " I 'll be an old man , Cary , long before Larry 's grown up . I feel like an old man now . " " But you 're not old . Grandmother really is old  --  over eighty . I could n't ask her to take Larry . I could n't ask Cousin Mildred to do it , either . Cousin Mildred seems almost as old as Grandmother , though ** course she is n't . Perhaps that 's because she 's never really lived . It 's funny , is n't it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I never thought of it before . But you 're right , they nearly always do . And yet , their delicacy 's never been outraged by a man 's grossness , they 've never been through the agony of childbirth . " " Perhaps that 's the very reason why . Men and women need each other , do n't you think so , Father ? Does n't a man 's grossness , as you call it , help a woman to overcome false shame ? Does n't her delicacy help him to overcome what some people call baser passions ' ? Not that I like those words . And I do n't like grossness . Savoie was n't gross . You are n't , either . " " No woman ever really knows any man , Cary . " She sighed . " Perhaps not . But what she does learn about them helps her a lot . And certainly , every woman needs to have a child . I ca n't he thankful enough that before ? " She did not say , " before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many sentences unfinished now , partly because it did tire her , a little , to talk , after all ; partly because she did not want to cause her father pain ; partly because she knew he would understand her anyway . " Besides , " she continued , reverting to what he had said about growing old , " it 'll make you feel younger , having a baby in the house . You 'll take wonderful care of him . " " I 'd do my very best for him , of course . But your grandmother may  | feel that would n't be good enough . She may feel he 'd be better off at Sorrento than he would here . Even though she is so old , she 's very wise and very experienced . She 'd know to supervise his care . She could give him the right background . " " I 'll tell her I do n't want him to go to Sorrento . I 'll tell her I want him to stay here , that I 'm sure you 'll take good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background he needs . I do n't believe backgrounds mean as much as they used to . Anyway , Sorrento does n't mean a thing to me . She does n't mean a great deal . That is , really . Of course she 's my grandmother , I respect her and all that , but it 's you I love , it 's Cindy Lou that 's my home . She 'll understand . " Clyde swallowed hard . " Well , perhaps she will , darling . But do n't forget Larry has another grandfather  --  a real grandfather . " " Do n't say real ' that way , please , Father . " " I wo n't , Cary , again . But Lamartine Vincent 's going to feel he 's got a claim on the boy , and rightly  --  his only son 's only son . " " Armande may have a son , too . We ought to be getting news from her any day now . " " Yes , that 's so . " They had not spoken of Armande before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and though nearly all the barriers of speech were down between them , that one still remained . Cary had never mentioned Pierre 's name to her father since the scene in the gazebo . But now , at last , she did so . " There 's something I want to tell you , Father . " " Then you must . " " Pierre came to see me before he went away . I mean , he came alone . It was the morning after the fete champetre , when his mother was n't well enough to go back to New Orleans . He came through the garden and found me in the gazebo . He did it deliberately . " " If I 'd known that , Cary ? " " Yes , and that was why I did n't want you to know  --  then . But it 's also why I do want you to know  --  now . Because , you see , he told me he loved me . " " He had no right to tell you that . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he would n't have married a divorced woman . He told me so himself . He said he came to Louisiana hoping I 'd become his mistress . But he also told me that if I 'd been free , when he first met me , he 'd have wanted me for his wife . He never thought of me as  --  well , as just another woman with whom he 'd have enjoyed having an affair . So I 'm glad he told me . I knew I had the best husband in the world and I did all I could to be worthy of him  --  after I realized how close I 'd come to  --  well , to unutterable folly . It was n't hard , either , except  --  - except when I first knew he loved me , even if he did n't have a right to . "  | " Why , Cary ? " Clyde could not help asking . But he knew without being told . " Because I loved him . I tried hard not to , honestly I did , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped me over that bad time . Then , afterward  --  well , when a girl 's husband loves her the way Savoie loved me , she ca n't let him down . She does n't want to . And what she gives him in return is n't pretense . It 's sincere  --  as far as it goes . But just the same .... " " I 've been afraid this was the way it was , Cary . " " But Savoie never knew . He never guessed . You know everything , Father , you guess everything . I 'm so glad you do and that Savoie did n't . " It was first evening when they talked together like this and later Cary fell into a quiet sleep . Clyde continued to sit beside her , and about midnight Dr. Bringier , who had been called far up the river road on an emergency case , came in to see her before finally going home . He looked at her and shook his head . " I do n't think I 'll need to give her anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she is n't suffering now and I do n't think she will . " " No , I do n't think so , either , " Clyde answered . There was still no light breaking through the darkness when she wakened again . She felt for the hand that she knew was already stretched out to receive hers . " Father , I want to thank you for not saying anything against Pierre . Of course I know he could n't hold a candle to Savoie . But somehow , if you love a man , you just love him anyway . " " I know that , Cary . Because your mother just loved me  --  anyway . " " But you never did what Pierre ? " " I never tried to win a woman away from her husband . But it so happens I never wanted to . I did other things just as bad , when I did want to . Men do n't all sin in the same way . " " I do n't think of you as a sinner . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . . . . You 've cabled Bushrod , have n't you ? It 's only fair he should know . " " I realized that . So I did cable him and I 've been expecting a cable in reply . Of course he could n't get here before your mother 's funeral . But he 's probably on his way home now . " " I hope .... " Her voice trailed away into silence . Clyde wondered if she were hoping the same thing he was , that Bushrod would not get to Cindy Lou until after she died , that he and she could have these last precious hours to themselves . But she had drifted into semiconsciousness again and she never told him what it was she hoped . The next time she spoke to him , it was about something entirely different . " We never found the treasure , did we , Father ? "  | " No . But it did n't matter . We 've had so much , without it . " " I know we have . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . Not dirty gravel on top of it . I 've never told you , Father . ... I 'm so glad you did n't let Dupre have that land . And so sorry I did n't act as if I were , that day you told me about his offer . " " Do n't be sorry , Cary . I understood afterward  --  when you told me about Pierre . " " Yes , but you were hurt just the same . That 's what I 'm sorry about . Because you 've never hurt me . You 're right , though  --  it does n't matter now about the buried treasure . I 'm not disappointed because I did n't find it , truly I 'm not . You know I told you , that same day I was so hateful ? " " You were n't ever hateful , darling . " " Yes , I was . Anyway , I told you then I 'd stopped believing that I 'd find the treasure myself . And you 're right , it does n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure he will . Because of course it 's there . ... You wo n't forget what I said about Larry , will you , Father ? That he 's yours now and that no one must take him away from you . " " No , Cary , I sha n't forget . " They continued to talk about Larry for some minutes . Cary 's mind was completely clear . Though there was still no word from Bushrod , the expected message from the Vincents had come in , telling them that Armande had a son and that his name was Pierre Lamartine . Cary was sure this was going to make Clyde 's guardianship of Larry far easier to safeguard and Clyde was inclined to agree with her . He could visualize , as she did , that the Vincents might be spending more and more time in France , that their most absorbing interest would be centered in Armande and her children . Cary was calm and contented as they dwelt on this , and afterward she fell into another deep sleep . When she began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she was groping for Savoie , as she had the first time she wakened after the fire . But he was mistaken . " Pierre , " she said distinctly , " Pierre ! " She paused a moment and then she went on , still in a clear voice , " It 's terribly dark , in this passage , is n't it ? Of course I was warned that it would be , that I should n't go beyond the great chamber of the cave . It 's a little frightening , is n't it ? At least it would be , if I were alone . But since you 're with me at last , dearest . . . . " She died in Clyde 's arms , just before dawn . He laid her gently back on her pillows and went out of the room , closing the door very softly after him . The feeling that she must not be disturbed persisted so strongly that he continued to move as quietly as possible while going down the stairs and out into the garden . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a beautiful one , and the first rays of the sun were  | already gilding the grass and the flowers ; and suddenly Clyde saw , with surprise , that Lucy 's favorite camellias had burst into bloom , almost overnight . The garden was transfigured by their loveliness . He slopped and stripped the snowy blossoms from the laden shrubs , and when he went back to Cary 's room , his arms were full . " This time , " he murmured to himself , " this time they ca n't hide my ( lead away from me , before I 've even had a chance to say good-by . This time they ca n't tell me I must n't see her . I can strew flowers all around Cary , while she 's still lying in her own bed  --  her mother 's flowers . Then I can sit and look at her this once more . No one will come to disturb us for hours yet . " With the tenderest care , he placed the flowers around the quiet form , laying a cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blossom between the hands which he folded himself . Then , long and lovingly , he looked down on his daughter . Never , in her most radiant moments , had she seemed so beautiful to him .  | CHAPTER XIV CLYDE could not understand , in the days after Cary 's death , how it could ever have been his desire that Cindy Lou should be filled with merrymaking guests . He wanted to have his home to himself , except for Larry ; he longed unutterably for silence and solitude . Not that he thought for a moment that his mother-in-law and her elderly cousin were deliberately outwearing their welcome ; he could understand the reluctance of Miss Sophie to confide the new tombs of her daughter and granddaughter into his sole custody , her still greater reluctance to entrust him with the care of her infant greatgrandson ; and he knew that her cousin Mildred shared her feelings , in so far as it was possible for a woman who had never borne or lost a child to experience the emotions of one who had known travail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And certainly there was nothing about the bearing or behavior of these two black-clad old women to suggest they thought he himself should try to surmount his sorrow and , putting his grief resolutely behind him , look hopefully toward the future ; on the contrary , they respected and understood his loneliness and his loss , as he did theirs . But any alien presence in the shadowy house seemed intrusive to him now . It was still peopled with his dead . He needed to commune with them in peace . He had reached a point where the urgency of this need was so great that he had almost decided to confess it to his mother-in-law when she relieved him of the necessity by telling him , one afternoon when they were leaving the dining room , that she would like very much to have a quiet talk with him , and asking him when it would suit his convenience for her to do so . He had been sitting at the head of his table , with his mother-in-law at his right and Cousin Mildred at his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Lucy 's empty chair opposite him , yet unable to bring himself to order its removal ; and the hushed meals had been the most trying periods of all . The erstwhile cheerful servants crept noiselessly around the table , offering food which nobody wanted ; and though the three who were seated at the bereft board all tried to ease the situation by sporadic attempts at conversation , there were long pauses between forced comments and equally forced replies . This was not the sort of silence for which Clyde yearned ; it was even worse than clatter and chatter would have been . Yet they found no way of overcoming it ; they were all engulfed by it ; they seemed to sink deeper and deeper into its abyss . The chasm between himself and the stern old gentlewoman who had opposed his marriage to her daughter had narrowed with the years ; but though he had come to  | admire her highly and believed that she no longer resented him , they had never been on easy or affectionate terms with each other . He answered her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association ; however , the fact that she had spoken as if she were asking a favor of him was unexpectedly heart warming . " Any time that would suit you would be agreeable to me , of course , " he said . Then , as another empty , cheerless afternoon seemed to stretch out endlessly before him , he added , " Would you care to talk with me right away ? " " Thank you . I should like that very much . " She had not lowered her voice in making her request , and now she glanced toward Cousin Mildred , who instantly murmured that she had a slight headache and would like to retire , if Cousin Sophie and Cousin Clyde would excuse her . Then she scurried off toward the stairs . " Perhaps we might have a little fire in the library , " Miss Sophie continued . " It is still rather cool for this time of year  --  or are n't you finding it so ? At all events , there is something cheering about a fire . " They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when they received visits of condolence . Clyde had found both experiences appalling . He still seemed to see the beautiful painted parlor arranged for a funeral ; he still seemed to smother in the heavy scent of banked flowers . On the other hand , he had not entered the library since Lucy 's death ; the door had not even been opened . Hardly less than the chamber they had shared for so many years , this had been essentially their personal room . When he was alone , he had sat in his office ; but he could not ask his mother-in-law to go there . She was right  --  the library was the proper place for their talk . It would be hard to go in ; but once there , it would be less oppressive than the drawing room . He opened the door and stood back for her to precede him . Evidently no one had remembered to close the shutters here ; at all events , they were opened now and the late afternoon sunshine was pouring into the room . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not artificial : Lucy 's workbasket still stood on the little table beside her favorite chair , and on another table , near by , lay the book from which he had been reading aloud to her when they had last sat there together . The place was full of her presence , but it was a presence which had no relation to the closed casket and the sickening scent in the drawing room . He was conscious of overwhelming relief , almost of thankfulness , as he bent over and touched a match to the neatly laid fire . When he straightened up again , having assured himself that it would burn , he saw that his mother-in-law was already seated ; and , as soon as he had drawn up a chair , she spoke , without waiting for him to do so .  | " I received three letters this morning , which I should like to discuss with you , " she said . " One of these was from my overseer . He says I am very much needed at Sorrento . I will not burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence , especially as I feel completely capable of coping with it , once I am on the spot . But I think the sooner I am there , the better . " " Is it a situation in which I could be of any help ? " Clyde inquired . 1 le could hardly have responded otherwise . Yet the thought of leaving Cindy Lou was even more unwelcome to him than the requirement of sharing it . " Thank you . But as I just said , I feel quite capable of coping with i he situation . However , I should be much obliged if you would make the necessary travel arangements for Mildred and me . We can be ready to leave whenever you can get suitable reservations . I should prefer not to stay at a hotel , just now , if that can be avoided  --  in other words , if we could take a train from Convent for New Orleans that would make good connections with one going north from there ? " " I 'll see about it the first thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel hurried , you understand . " He hoped he spoke with conviction and , in one sense , he spoke with complete sincerity . He did not want her to feel hurried  --  that would he inhospitable and unfair . But to have Cindy Lou to himself again ... " Yes , I do understand , " she said quietly ; and suddenly he knew that she did and that the understanding had in it no element of hurt feelings . " Of course , if everything were not going well here , I would not leave , " she continued . " But I am satisfied that it is . Your servants are capable and devoted . Tudie is developing into an excellent nurse . 1 do not think she will need any advice or help in her care of Larry , hut if she does , Mrs. Surget and Dr. Bringier are both close at hand . Besides , Larry is a remarkably vigorous baby . I doubt if you will have any anxiety on the score of his health . But I know you will watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a great deal of confidence , Clyde , through the years . I know that Lucy found complete happiness in her marriage with you and that you were a true father to her daughter . You never failed her in any way and you will never fail Larry , either , I am sure of that . " " Thank you , " Clyde said in a low voice . He would have liked to say more , for he had never expected his mother-in-law to say as much . But he could not . " So it is not with anything connected with Larry 's immediate welfare that I wish to talk with you , " Miss Sophie went on . " It is about his future prospects . " " His future prospects ? " " Yes . I assume that , of course , he will be one of your heirs . But I p 300 have been wondering whether , in the interests of complete justice , I should not make him one of mine , also . " " I 'm afraid I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , in assuming that he 'll be my heir . But ? " She raised her hand and something about the gesture robbed her interruption of all discourtesy . " Let me explain . You knew , of course , that Lucy wished to have Bushrod inherit Sorrento and Amalfi . Cary was so young when she left Virginia and was there so little afterward that she never had any special feeling for my plantations  --  all her interests were in Louisiana . Besides , she was amply provided for , both by you and by her husband . So it was understood between Lucy and myself that Cary should not have any share in my property . But this understanding was never put into writing  --  at least to my knowledge . Was it , to yours ? " " No . Lucy never discussed the matter with me , beyond saying what you 've just told me  --  that she wanted Bushrod to have Amalfi and Sorrento . That seemed to me eminently fair . As you say , Cary had no special interests in Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are very sure that Lucy left no will or even any memo-randum ? " " Reasonably sure . She never spoke of that , either . And I think I 'd have been bound to know it , if she had . She would n't have done a thing like that secretly  --  in fact , I do n't think she could have . She talked with me freely , she respected my judgment . She certainly would have asked my advice and we 'd have consulted a lawyer together . We  --  it was our habit to do things together . " " I know , " Miss Sophie said ; and again Clyde was moved by the consciousness of her understanding . " Nevertheless , in a case like this , we must take every precaution . I assume you have n't looked through her desk  --  or in any other place where she might have kept papers ? " " No . I have n't touched anything that belonged to her . I  --  I ca n't . " " Would you like me to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , Clyde . It is painful for me , too , of course . But this is your first experience of the kind , and I have had to meet others like it , many times already . If it would help you  --  or relieve you  --  to have me  --  I will not say to put Lucy 's personal belongings in order , for of course she always kept them in perfect order  --  but to have me go through them and decide what should be done with them  --  her clothes , as well as her papers ? " She paused , and Clyde knew she was thinking of those other personal belongings which she had been obliged to go through  --  her husband 's , her four sons ' , probably her parents ' as well . No , bereavement and tragedy were nothing new to this aged woman , who still bore herself with such calm dignity . He was shamed by her fortitude , but he was grateful for it .  | " Thank you , " he said again . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then , with an effort , he added , " I suppose some of the clothes should be given away  --  those which we would have no special reason for keeping and which might be of use to someone else . And probably some of the papers should be carefully preserved and others destroyed . I will leave you to decide about all such things . " " I will try to merit your confidence .... And now , let us go back to this question of inheritance . My will , as it stands , leaves everything to Lucy . My first thought was that , in altering it , I should leave everything to Bushrod , in accordance with Lucy 's expressed wishes . Now I am not so sure that it would be right . It is true that Cary did not need my plantations or care for them . But it is no longer a question of Cary  --  it is a question of her son . Is it conceivable to you that he might care for them , or need them ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Amalfi . I 'd only thought of him in connection with Cindy Lou . But yes , now that you speak of it , I can see it 's conceivable that he might care very greatly for them , that he might even need them . I 'll do the best I can for him , you know that ; you 've been good enough to say so . I think I have enough so that he 'll never lack for any essentials . But of course I ca n't be sure . I nearly went under once before . I would have , if Lucy had n't been here to help me . And now , there is n't anyone . . . . Besides , I 'm not a young man any more . I 'm  --  well , I 'm pretty close to being an old one , though I do n't like to admit it . If I should die ? " " I have faith that you wo n't die , and I have faith that you 'll never go under , that you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if you ca n't give him all the luxuries . At the same time , I ca n't lightly deprive him of the heritage which might be his in Virginia . I know that , as a Virginian , I 'm prejudiced . But I still feel it to be a very special heritage . " " Yes , you 're right . It is  --  a very special heritage . " He looked across at her and , as he did so , he felt that she herself personified much which gave that heritage a special value . " Of course Cary entrusted Larry to me on her deathbed , " he said . " As I said before , I 've never thought of him except in connection with Cindy Lou . But if it were for his welfare ? " " That 's what we must decide . We must weigh one advantage against another . Let me repeat that I would not lightly deprive Larry of his Virginia heritage . On the other hand , if Bushrod were the sole inheritor of Sorrento and Amalfi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think I quite follow you . " " I believe you promised Lucy , when you married her , that her children should both be your heirs , that they should share and share alike . Cary is dead , and what you would normally have given her , naturally  | goes to her son . But Bushrod is alive . He will certainly expect his share . " Clyde rose , thrusting his hands behind him , so that his mother-in-law should not see how convulsively he had clenched them . He could still control the expression of his face  --  that much , at least , he owed to his career as a gambler ; but at this moment his hands might very well betray him . Bushrod 's share ! As if the wastrel had not already had more than was due a scoundrel of his stripe  --  the substantial sum which had settled his Richmond debts , the twenty thousand he had extracted from his stepfather just before Cary 's wedding ! Clyde knew that if he told Miss Sophie about this , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than fulfilled . But how could he tell her that her only grandson , for whom her unshaken love was the only weak spot in her armor , had been expelled from the gentlemen 's club where membership was part of that Virginia heritage in which she felt so much proper pride ? How could he denounce Bushrod for what he was  --  a card cheat and a blackmailer ? She had already bravely borne , in her lifetime , more than any woman should be called upon to bear without breaking . Now that life was drawing to an end and , after losing her home , her husband and her four sons in a horrible war , she had lost her only daughter and her only granddaughter in a holocaust which , though less widespread , was equally horrible . He could not give the blow which all too literally might be the death stroke , even to save Larry . " Certainly Bushrod will expect his share , ma'am , " he said gently , though a little heavily . " And certainly he shall have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . I was quite sure you would feel that way about it . That is why I brought up the subject ; and that is what I meant when I said I thought I might suggest something which would simplify matters all around . " Clyde was caught off guard by the directness of her gaze ; the wise old eyes were wells of understanding and  --  could it be possible ? ? of sympathy . " Before there was any question of Larry , Lucy wanted Bushrod to inherit all the Virginia properties , in which Larry now has a right to share , " Miss Sophie continued . " I am eager to follow Lucy 's wishes , and you have been good enough to agree this should be done . But it would be manifestly unfair to Larry if , after being excluded from the Virginia heritage , he were still expected to surrender part of the Louisiana heritage as well . In a word , it should be made plain to Bushrod that if he takes full title to both Sorrento and Amalfi , any claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou is thereby canceled . That was what I meant when I referred to simplifying the situation for all of us . " For a moment , Clyde stared at her dumbly . The waves of relief and of thankfulness which had swept through him while she was speaking  | left him , literally , bereft of words . With the same calmness that had characterized everything she had said in the course of the interview , his mother-in-law returned his look . It was he who broke the silence . " Miss Sophie , " he said huskily , " I want you to know I feel it was n't only in giving me Lucy 's heart that God was very good to me . I feel he was good to me in letting me know you . " " ' Thank you for telling me that , " she said . " I knew how you felt about Lucy and , of course , there is every reason why you should . As far as I am concerned . . . . " She turned away , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her eyes and that her face had suddenly softened . " You  --  you are magnanimous in your estimate of me , Clyde . " She opened the volume which was lying on the table beside her , the one from which Clyde had last read to Lucy , and glanced at the passage where a bookmark indicated a stopping place . Then she laid it down again . " About this will , " she said , " I will take the necessary legal steps as soon as possible . Of course , under ordinary circumstances , Bushrod should be consulted . But since he will not be available immediately  --  and I am coming to the reasons for that presently  --  and since I do not feel that , at my age , I should delay any important undertaking , I shall draw it up at once  --  or almost at once . slut it occurs to me that I may have an ally on whom you probably have not counted , and that I had better talk with her , too . " " An ally ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands lightly in front of him . He was no longer afraid to have Miss Sophie see them . " Yes . I should not be surprised if Mabel were secretly longing for a reconciliation . We are talking with each other very candidly , Clyde ; so why not admit , in confidence , that Mabel has probably not had many admirers in the course of her life ? She is not  --  well , she is not exactly the type that commands widespread masculine attention . " This time , when Clyde 's glance met his mother-in-law 's , he saw there was actually a slight twinkle in her eye . " Bushrod 's courtship , when she had almost reached the age where any woman , however fascinating , is conscious that her powers of enchantment are waning , must have seemed to her like the suit of a Prince Charming , " Miss Sophie went on , imperturbably . " And whatever his faults as a husband , I have no doubt that Bushrod showed himself very charming after marriage , too . I do not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Perhaps she does , " Clyde admitted . Now that Miss Sophie had presented the idea to him in this way , he did not find it surprising . " There is also another aspect of the case which might be helpful to us . Numbers of rich New Yorkers seem to be discovering Virginia , so to speak , just now . The quantity of estates they are buying , or attempting to buy , in the Old Dominion is really amazing . I do not quite understand why they seem to fancy themselves suddenly in the role of  | country gentry , but the fact remains that they do . " Again , Clyde caught the humorous glint in the wise old eyes . " I think Mabel would be very much gratified at the prospect of establishing herself and her husband as landed proprietors , " Miss Sophie continued . " Especially as it could be done with comparatively little expense . If I 'm not mistaken , she shares her father 's aversion to loose purse strings . My suggestion to her would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bygones , they should build a house on the ruins of Amalfi , following the original plan in as far as that is practical for present-day requirements . The house would be theirs . Then , after my death , they could move into mine if they preferred  --  or they could hold it in trust for their offspring , if any . I suppose it is still imaginable that they might have a child . Mabel may not be as old as she looks . But , even if she is , motherhood is probably not an impossibility . " " No , I suppose not , " Clyde muttered . He had never thought of Mabel as a potential mother , and he did so now with reluctance , as the beautiful maternal images of Lucy and Cary rose before him . Moreover , if Bushrod and Mabel should have a child , that would no doubt preclude any possibility that in time the Virginia estate , or any portion of it , might come into Larry 's possession . But that , he reminded himself , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no claim against Larry 's undisputed ownership of Cindy Lou should ever be raised ... . With a start , Clyde realized he had not been listening to what his mother-in-law was telling him . ... my purpose to stipulate , " he heard her say , as his attention focused on her words , " in this will I propose to draw , that any child of Bushrod and Mabel 's , or of any marriage he might enter into in the event of her death , could inherit Amalfi and Sorrento . But if he should die without such issue , the property would naturally revert to Larry . " " I see , " Clyde said . He did not add anything further . He did not feel anything further was needed . He gathered that Miss Sophie did not think so , either , from the way she went on . " Now that those questions are settled , as far as they can be in the course of one conversation , " she continued , " I think I should speak to you about the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes ago , that I would tell you why I realized that Bushrod would not immediately be available for consultation . One of those letters was from him . It seems that he has had typhoid fever  --  a light case , fortunately . There is no cause for alarm . But he was slightly delirious at the time you cabled him about his mother 's death , and his physician  --  a Dr. Norchais , who seems to be a man of good sense ? felt it would be better to withhold the news from him until he was stronger . So it was delayed in reaching him . I do not know why he did not ask the doctor to cable a reply for him , when he did get it ,  | but doubtless there was some good reason . This letter from him was written before you sent the second cable , announcing Cary 's death . You probably will hear from him yourself within the next day or so . " " Probably , " Clyde muttered . While he had been somewhat puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too preoccupied with other matters to give it much thought ; and when he did think of it he had regarded it as a reprieve . He was , therefore , inclined to regard the attack of typhoid fever as a blessing in disguise , and regretted only that the case had not been a more serious one . However , e could not say any of this to Bushrod 's grandmother , whose vision , clear as it was in most respects , was naturally obscured by love when she looked at him . " It may be some time before he will be strong enough to undertake an ocean voyage , " Miss Sophie went on . " And , if you approve , I shall write him , suggesting that , before coming to Cindy Lou , he stop off to see me at Sorrento . I would then lay before him immediately the arrangement on which you and I are agreed . I believe I could do so in such a way that he would grasp its advantages and the whole question would be settled without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , " Clyde answered , still in more or less of a mutter ; he would have liked to say that he had never found Bushrod slow to grasp anything that was to his advantage . " The third letter , " Miss Sophie continued , as if she had now dismissed the subject of Bushrod for the time being , " was from Pierre de Chanet , who wrote to express the sympathy of the entire family . But it was more than a letter of condolence . It also contained some rather bad news . " Clyde lifted his head quickly . He had not been able to feel that the news from Bushrod was bad , as far as he was concerned , and he could not believe that any news coming from Pierre de Chanet could cause him much distress , either . But he was eager to know what form it had taken . " Of course everyone at Chateau Monteregard was deeply affected upon hearing of our terrible losses , " Miss Sophie went on . " But poor Mr. Vincent was more crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his only son . After all , this is natural . Mrs. Vincent is closer to Armande than she was to Savoie , and Armande has her husband and her baby to divert her thoughts from her bereavement . But Mr. Vincent could think of nothing else , and his mental condition has had a sad effect on his physical condition , as so often happens . He has had a stroke . Evidently , he has rallied , to a certain extent ; but he speaks with difficulty and two of his limbs are affected . Mrs. Vincent is devoting all her time and strength to him . Of course there can be no question of moving him for a long time . "  | " I am very sorry , " Clyde managed to say . But the words were perfunctory . He was sorry that Lamartine Vincent , who had long been a good friend of his , should have come to such a pass through grief ; and fleetingly he resolved , for the first time , to put an end to his own brooding before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another . But he could not feel sorry that the Vincents would not be hastening home , that he would not have to share Larry with them . His thoughts raced ahead and , in his mind 's eye , he saw Mrs. Vincent , who had never cared about Victoria , relinquishing her rights in it to Larry  --  for a consideration , of course , but still doing it . He could see her persuading Armande to do the same . Armande was , to all intents and purposes , a Frenchwoman now . She was dressed by Worth and Redfern , she inhabited a magnificent chateau , she moved in the most sophisticated Continental society , she was addressed as Madame la Marquise . She could not have all these privileges and perquisites in Louisiana and they meant much to her . Yes , someday Victoria , as well as Cindy Lou , would be Larry 's . He could well afford to do without the Virginia heritage , great as this was . He would have one greater still in Louisiana . And his grandfather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am sure you are , " Clyde heard Miss Sophie saying . He did not realize , at first , with what she was agreeing . He had been looking so far into the future that , for the first time since Lucy 's death , he had been unmindful of the present . And , before he could fully collect himself , his mother-in-law had risen , saying she did not think there was anything more they needed to discuss and that she would bid him good afternoon . A week later she and Cousin Mildred left for Virginia . In the meantime , Miss Sophie had " gone through things , " as she had promised . No document of any importance had been discovered among Lucy 's papers . She had saved all the letters she had ever received from her mother , from Clyde , from Cary and from Bushrod . They were separated into neat little bundles . Miss Sophie told Clyde that she was leaving his letters and Cary 's in Lucy 's desk , but that , with his permission , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clothing Miss Sophie quietly gave away . In recent years , Lucy had bought very few new dresses , and only the ones Clyde had given her in the earlier days of their marriage had qualities that made them worth saving ; these her mother packed away with loving care , labeling each trunk as she did so . There was not much jewelry , either . Miss Sophie knew that Lucy had given most of the heirlooms and all the Page ornaments to Cary on the occasion of the girl 's marriage , and if she wondered what had become of the other jewels , she did not say so . Clyde thought she probably guessed . Neither one said anything about a future meeting when they parted  | at the depot . They both knew there would be few  --  if any  --  such meetings . But not because of ill will . After long years of antagonism and resentment , they had arrived at mutual respect and mutual understanding . These feelings were made manifest in their farewells to each other . On his way home from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as was now his daily habit . Usually , he and his mother-inlaw had gone there together , since the distance was too great for her to walk , and he did not like to be the one to suggest that she should be driven there by a servant . But the previous evening she had said she would like to make her last visit to her granddaughter 's tomb alone , and asked if Zack could not take her to the cemetery and wait for her at the gate ; the Vincents ' lot was not far from there ; she could easily walk that short way , with no help from anyone , even Mildred . Clyde had complied all the more readily with her request because he , too , would have preferred to make such visits alone and was thankful that henceforth he would always be free to do so . It had been a source of great grief to him that he could not insist that Cary , like her mother , should be entombed at Cindy Lou . But he knew long-established custom ordained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in life ; a departure from this tradition would be viewed with great disapproval throughout the countryside , under any circumstances . In the present case , when the wedded pair had perished so close together and as the result of the same holocaust , such criticism would be all the more severe and widespread  --  no doubt properly . So Clyde had suppressed his longing , not voicing it to anyone , and he knew he had been right in following this course . But at first his grief had been all the greater because of his inner rebellion and because Cary seemed so much farther away from him than Lucy . Now , at last , he found assuagement both in the realization that Lucy 's quiet resting place was hers alone  --  and therefore more wholly his own sanctuary ? and in the thought that Cary was sharing a noble monument , since this was her due . He approached the Vincents ' stately tomb with more calmness than he had hitherto been able to command . Usually the tall iron gates of the driveway leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage of a funeral procession ; pedestrians habitually entered by one of two smaller gates , on either side of the entrance , which were difficult to operate because of the unwieldiness caused by a heavy weight , suspended on an equally heavy chain , that hung from them and closed them automatically . A mourner , burdened with flowers , inevitably found their manipulation doubly difficult . Clyde was thankful to discover that , for once , the driveway was open and walked slowly down it , shifting his great sheaf of white azaleas and purple irises from one arm to the other as he went along , and pausing , occasionally , to take  | some note of his familiar surroundings which , hitherto , he had hardly noticed . As Miss Sophie had said , the Vincents ' lot was not far from the gates ; but a wide variety of tombs rose from the intervening terrain . Some of these were mounds , no larger than the interment of a single coffin would require , which had been rigidly cemented and starkly whitewashed ; others , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple ovens , were crumbling with age and neglect and lank grasses sprouted from them . There were , naturally , crosses of every size and kind , some of elaborately wrought iron , some of carefully chiseled marble , some of rudely hewn wood . The cemetery was very deep , extending back almost to the cypress swamps ; and it was dominated , at the rear , by the tallest and most imposing of these crosses ; even from a distance , Clyde was conscious of its majestic presence . Other crosses surmounted stone books or marked the corners of the ornate railings which enclosed the larger lots . Unlike the cemeteries of Barataria and the region near Grand Isle , with both of which Clyde was acquainted , this was not rich in shadow boxes ; but he saw one , containing an appealing figure of the Virgin , robed in white and cloaked in blue . Flowers grew in abundance and , for the most part , apparently untended ; they seemed to slope off in every direction . If he had cared to pluck irises and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earlier in the season , there must have been quantities of paper-white narcissuses ; soon there would be even greater quantities of roses . The more modern and important tombs , which were adorned with angels and other symbolic figures , were also decorated with well-filled flower vases ; Clyde was by no means exceptional in his daily ritual , though , for the time being , he was alone . The Vincents ' lot was one of the many enclosed with an iron railing ; but the gate to this was left open for his convenience . The monument was a towering one : a sarcophagus surmounted by a stone urn and severely plain , except for this and the fluted pillars at each corner , in turn surmounted a burial vault , so large as to suggest a chapel , with a complete facade of pillars and elaborate carvings simulating torches . A second urn , similar in design to the other , but open at the top , rose between the stone steps leading to the bronze doors . The flowers with which it was filled had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not fresh enough to satisfy Clyde . He removed them , emptied the urn of its water and refilled it . Then , with loving care , he arranged the purple and white flowers he had brought with him . He was not skilled in such arts ; it was Lucy who had always arranged their flowers . But what he lacked in proficiency , he made up for in patience and devotion . When he finally turned to leave , the urn had blossomed forth in beauty . He was in no special hurry to reach home again and , since he no  | longer had an armful of flowers , he could wander unencumbered down the driveway . Earlier , it was the character and setting of the tombs which had arrested him ; now , he found himself studying their inscriptions . Most of the names on these were French , some of them preceded by the " de " which was the indication of nobility ; and , in several instances , where a birthplace was recorded , this was in France . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never heard of before ; but one  --  La Rochelle  --  struck a responsive chord . The Chateau of Monteregard , if he were not greatly mistaken , was near that port . Cary and Savoie might well have visited it when they were staying with the De Chanets . Or possibly , Cary had gone there alone with Pierre . She must have been alone with him in the dark cave of which she had spoken , almost with her dying breath . It was more than probable that she had also visited the surrounding countryside and its towns with him . Pierre would easily have found some pretext for limiting such expeditions to himself and the object of his desire ... . The supposition disturbed Clyde 's new-found sense of calm and he decided it was high time he left this somber place before he started some other fantastic train of thought . But as he turned away from the inscription which had proved so unreasonably upsetting , his eye fell on a plain stone slab and , involuntarily , he stopped . " Ici repose en paix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Bourgeois nee le 3 Fevrier 1806 decade le 4 Novembre 1839 Bonne mere Tendre Spouse et sincere amie Elie emporte au tombeau les regrets de ceux qui font connu . " The lettering of this simple epitaph was quaint and obscure . At several points Clyde , whose French was still somewhat sketchy , had been obliged to stop and puzzle over a word which was almost illegible , as well as more or less unintelligible to him . But it was not , after all , this inscription which had constrained him to stop . It was the words above it , which were clear , clean cut and newly chiseled : CLOSED FOREVER He did not have the vaguest idea of who Aimee Boucry de Bourgeois could have been , or how a woman who was a good mother , a tender wife and a sincere friend happened to be buried alone ; neither did he know why , more than fifty years after her death  --  and not until that  | time  --  her tomb had been " Closed Forever . " Then and there he resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of these questions . Simultaneously , he made another firm resolution : Savoie 's parents , of course , would still logically expect burial in their family vault ; but , as far as Cary was concerned , it had closed forever , not only on her beautiful body , but on all the secrets she had not shared with him . As he approached the garden , he saw that Tudie had taken Larry out in his perambulator . The baby was bareheaded and the sun , shining on his hair , which was glossy and black like his father 's , gave it an added sheen . He was wearing a little blue knitted jacket which Lucy had made for him and which was exactly the color of his eyes ? Cary 's eyes . He was vigorously banging a silver rattle against the strap which confined his plump little person and , as usual , he hailed his grandfather with delight . But Clyde noticed a sign of progress which had gone unobserved before . " I did n't realize he could sit up straight , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hardly touches those fluffy pillows behind him at all ! " " Yassuh ! Nossuh ! " Tudie agreed with pride . " Won ' be no time atall afore he starts to crawl . I never see no such smart baby , me , or either one feel his strength so young . " " Could he sit up in a high chair , do you think ? " " Jes ' as good as he kin in a carriage . " " Very well . Get Miss Cary 's high chair out of the storeroom and put it in the dining room . I 'll have Larry with me , at mealtimes , from now on . " He gave his grandson a hearty hug and turned away , in the direction of the little enclosure where Lucy lay . Then he halted and turned again . He could visit that sanctuary later , after the day 's work was done . Meanwhile , many matters , too long neglected , demanded his attention . Larry had been left to him in trust , and it would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that obligation . He could truly serve the dead only through his service to the living . He walked back toward the house and entered it by the door leading to his office . Then he rolled back the top of his desk and opened his safe . The entries in the ledger were complete , through the day when he and Lucy had last worked on them together  --  the day of her death . As he assembled his neglected papers and carried on the figures from there , the results were so reassuring that he wondered , more logically than ever before , why he had allowed Valois Dupre to talk him into selling the narrow strip of land , at the rear of the plantation , where the gravel bed was located . He had not confessed to Cary , on her deathbed , that he had done this , because he had been greatly moved by her admission that she was sorry for what she had said to him about it , the  | day when they had met on the river road and he had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken her at her word , the first time , feeling , s he thought the matter over , that he should do anything and everything he could to lighten the load of indebtedness which Lucy was helping him to shoulder  --  and to lift . Necessarily , he had told Lucy about the sale , because after she began to help him with the ledgers she was obliged to enter all credits and debits in their books ; but she had taken the news with her usual calmness , saying  --  just as Clyde had said to Cary on the occasion of their last talk  --  that their lives had been so full of numerous treasure in any case that they did not need to dig for more . Besides , Lucy had added  --  considering the question from another and more practical angle  --  why should they give even a passing thought to parting with a few barren arpents when the sale of these helped them to safeguard hundreds that were giving a rich yield of sugar and tobacco ? Her wise and dispassionate attitude had been a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain degree , he had eventually succeeded in sharing it . But he had never ceased to chafe over the loss of anything connected with Cary , or to regret his failure to keep intact the property he had originally acquired . Now , as he looked at his orderly books , it occurred to him for the first time that possibly he might someday be in a position to buy back the tract of land where he had sat in the sun , watching his little daughter as she dug and dug until finally , warm and weary , she had flung down her small spade and come to nestle in his arms . . . . He could not buy that land yet , of course , but perhaps someday . . . . Evidently Dupre was really not much interested in the property after all . In any event , he had not even yet started the process of washing the gravel , much less loading it and transporting it . If Clyde 's mind had not been so occupied with other things , he would have asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had not seen much of each other lately . The next time they met , Clyde would question his friend about the matter ... . Meanwhile , the longer he worked on the records and accounts which had lain untouched since Lucy 's death , the more causes for reassurance he found . Over two thousand carrots of strong , dark tobacco were ready for shipment and they would bring a good price , now that two families  --  the Guglielmos and the Roussels  --  were vying with each other for dominance as perique factors , whereas the Roussels had formerly controlled the entire market . The cane fields had also yielded abundantly . Fair weather had permitted the harvest to proceed almost without interruption ; not one heavy frost had closed down to threaten the tall growth , even with the coming of December . Sugar was selling at three and a half cents for plantation raws ; altogether , he should realize forty thousand dollars after paying the Vincent tollage for processing . From that , of course , land taxes , labor , fertilizer and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the net profits would still far exceed his expectations . For several hours , Clyde worked steadily and intensively on his ledgers . But when Zack came to tell him that dinner was served , he smiled as he looked up . " I believe I have a young gentleman dining with me today , Zack , " he said . " So you does , suh , for a fac ' ! " Zack answered , returning the smile . Larry was already at the table when Clyde reached it and after that , he did not dread going into the dining room any more . The silent , somber meals were a thing of the past . THE NEWS which Clyde received from abroad , both directly and indirectly , continued to seem extremely important to him . Miss Sophie wrote him almost immediately . While she was on the train , she had given a good deal of thought to their long conversation in the library , she told him . As a result of this reflection , she had decided to go straight through to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence that she should see Mr. Stoddard and Mabel immediately than that she should give her first attention to straightening out the situation at Sorrento . She had found Mr. Stoddard more than co-operative ; indeed , he had been so insistent that she and Cousin Mildred should be his guests , during their stay in the city , that it would have been really discourteous to decline . As a result of this hospitality , she had been able to have a series of discussions with him , instead of the single conference she had sought ; and each time they talked with one another they were in closer agreement than on the previous occasion . Mr. Stoddard had even gone so far as to say that he thought her offer generous , and that the acceptance of it would be extremely advantageous to his daughter . With Mabel herself , Miss Sophie had not had a chance to talk , for the simple reason that Mabel had taken the first ship for France , after hearing about Bushrod 's attack of typhoid fever . Bushrod had written her an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit him to take pen in hand  --  in fact , over the protests of his physician and his nurses , who insisted he should not so overtax his limited strength . He had told Mabel how much he needed her , now that he was ill and alone in a foreign  | country ; moreover , her presence would help him to assuage his sorrow In the great loss he had suffered through the death of his mother and sister . It was really a beautiful letter , and Mabel had been very much moved ... . Miss Sophie did not say that Mr. Stoddard had been very much moved ; and Clyde reflected , not without a certain grim satisfaction , that the harsh old man had probably not been hoodwinked for a moment , but had understood that Bushrod 's allowance , as a remittance man , had proved inadequate for his extravagant way of life , and that the only way he could see to increase his income , during his convalescence  --  which he would not be averse to prolonging , if this could he done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife . Clyde took , if possible , an even greater satisfaction in the thought that Stoddard , shrewd as he was , had been no match for Miss Sophie . Her son-in-law could visualize exactly how she had handled that series of conferences , and how each had resulted in " closer agreement " than its predecessor ... . Eventually , Mabel wrote to Clyde herself , in terms more affectionate than ever before , and in a way which indicated triumphant contentment . She and Bushrod were really having a second honeymoon , she said . They had been fortunate in finding a beautiful villa , fully staffed and finely furnished , at Menton , and they were going to remain there until Bushrod had entirely recovered his strength . After that , they would travel for a time in a leisurely way ; there were so many places she had never seen and that Bushrod was eager to show her , among them the great German spas . Of course , she had been to Europe several times ; but her father 's idea had always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been handicapped because he had never learned foreign languages . She did not need to tell Mr. Batchelor that Bushrod spoke French like a native and that he had a good command of German and Italian as well . He was giving her lessons . Naturally , she had studied French at school , but that was not like having Bushrod for a teacher . And other languages were so neglected in the United States . It really was very backward , in cultural directions ... . Clyde smiled over this letter , too . Although geography was not one of his strong points , he did not need to be told that Menton was conveniently near Monte Carlo , and he thought it quite likely that Bushrod would not regain his strength sufficiently to travel much until he had exhausted the possibilities of the Casino , or Mabel 's newly awakened patience , or both . Then , after a " cultural " interval devoted to museums and cathedrals , he would doubtless " overtax " his strength again and require the refreshment of a spa where the gambling rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , Clyde doubted very greatly whether Bushrod and Mabel would return to the United States before autumn ; and then they would very logically  | go straight to Sorrento , so that the plans for the new house at Amalfi might be made on the spot . This meant that they would hardly be coming to Cindy Lou much before Christmas . Nothing could have suited him better . Meanwhile , he also heard several times from the Vincents . The first of these letters came from Armande , who told him that her father was very low ; indeed , the attendant physician had come out of the sickroom looking extremely grave , and had said that it would be well to summon a priest , and that until other instructions were issued , the patient was to be given nothing except champagne . Though Clyde had never come in close contact with the sacrament of extreme unction , he was acquainted with its grave significance ; the reference to champagne , however , puzzled him , until Mrs. Surget , to whom he showed the letter , clarified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its usage , in such a connection , for a long while ; but I do remember , vaguely , having heard that it was customary in certain parts of France for a physician to make such a recommendation , instead of saying outright that the end was near . The family was supposed to understand , and still , feelings were spared , scenes averted and all amenities observed . You must admit , Clyde , that the French make a fine art out of savoir-faire ! " " All right , I 'll admit it , " he said . But he spoke rather grudgingly , and Mrs. Surget had no trouble in gathering that the admission carried with it no admiration , and that probably his lack of enthusiasm had other causes than the one under discussion . " Well , evidently poor Lamartine is in a bad way , " he went on , looking at the letter again . " But I do n't believe he 's dead , after all . This was written over two weeks ago , and I have n't had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst had happened . " Clyde 's surmise proved correct . About ten days later , he received a second letter , this time from Mrs. Vincent , which told him that though extreme unction and champagne had both been administered , as directed , her dear husband had rallied after all , and was even beginning to regain some of his powers of speech , though his physical helplessness was as great as ever . " In fact , " she continued , " I am writing you now in accordance with Lamartine 's expressed wish . It is evident that our sojourn in France must be greatly prolonged , and that when ? or if  --  he is able to return to Victoria , he will not be able to take an active part in its supervision . Under these circumstances , it would mean a great deal to him  --  and , I may add , to Armande and me , also  --  if you would undertake the management of the plantation , on a business basis . Of course , you have had a hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamartine and poor Savoie relied on your advice and your help , and I know that since we suffered our great loss you have taken an even more active part in its direction . Grateful  | si we are for your good offices , we can not permit you to continue them , as a favor , indefinitely . ( Of course , in a sense , everything you would do would be considered a favor , but I think you will grasp my meaning . ) We should , therefore , be most appreciative if , without false pride , you would set forth the terms on which you feel such an arrangement would be not only fair , but profitable , from your point of view . " So it had come  --  the chance for which he had so greatly hoped . He had not lifted a finger , he had not voiced a wish  --  and still it had come . For some time already , he had been taking Larry through the gardens and orchard and to the stables and dairy , carrying the baby over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More recently , he had set Larry in front of him on the saddle when he went to the drying sheds and the sugarhouse . Now , for the first time , he went farther afield with his precious charge  --  past the charred remains of the mock Monteregard , from which he still averted his eyes , and on to the big house and wide arpents of Victoria . The baby sat as straight on horseback as he did in his perambulator and his high chair , and he showed no fear when Spice , Clyde 's favorite mount , changed his gait from a walk to a rack . Instead , Larry gave the gurgle of delight for which his grandfather had learned to listen . Clyde , who was holding him firmly enclosed in the hollow of one arm , raised the other and waved his hand back and forth in an encompassing gesture , as he reined in his horse . " That 's going to be yours someday , Larry , " he said . " All of it ! And when it is , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more . I 'll see to that . " Larry gurgled again and pounded on the pommel . Clyde understood this to mean that the baby wanted to be off again , if anything at a smarter clip than before . The ride was resumed at a lively pace and , before it ended , embraced both plantations . Then late that night , after Larry had been put to bed , Clyde spent several hours in figuring . Before he went to bed himself , he wrote to Mrs. Vincent , telling her that he was honored by her request and that he would be glad to assume the management of Victoria on a business basis . He suggested a salary of five thousand a year . He had reckoned that with careful management he could gradually pay off the mortgage at Cindy Lou and still have enough left for Larry and himself to live on , from the proceeds of his own crops ; he could even put aside a little for Larry 's education . Everything that came from Victoria could be salted away for its eventual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' time he would have fifty thousand dollars , plus interest , and with fifty thousand . . . . Even if he could not live to see Larry grow up , he could live for ten years . He must . . . . In the same mail that brought an answer from Mrs. Vincent , accepting his terms and thanking him for his co-operation , Clyde received  | another letter from Mabel : she felt that the summer climate of the Riviera was perhaps a little too enervating for Bushrod , now that he was so much better . They were leaving Menton for Paris the following week ; from there they were going to Munich , Dresden and Berlin to see the galleries . After that , to Baden-Baden ... . Clyde grinned and chucked Larry under the chin . As time went on , he had more and more reason to congratulate himself on his prophetic vision . Bushrod and Mabel landed at New York in late October and , almost immediately , proceeded to Sorrento , accompanied by an eminent architect who was enormously pleased at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but modeled after the original one at Amalfi . According to him , there was no reason why work could not begin as soon as the plans were approved and , with any luck at all , the foundations could be laid before the ground froze ; after those were in , building could continue straight through the winter . He was slightly puzzled because his clients did not wish to remain at Sorrento while the building progressed , as he himself thought it far and away the most impressive estate he had ever seen ; and he was still more puzzled when Mr. Page refused point blank to winter in Richmond , in spite of the practicality of such a plan and Mrs. Page 's avowed approval of it . However , he agreed , under pressure , that Washington was not too far off to permit frequent conferences and , since Mr. Page seemed to feel that was the ideal place to spend the winter , he would offer no objections . But a remote plantation in Louisiana  --  a place where there was no telephone and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not guarantee that a move might not be made , contrary to their wishes , if they stayed there for any length of time , because he would not be able to get in touch with them readily . Of course , the alternative would be to hold up work until their return ; but he understood they wished this to progress as rapidly as possible . Of course , a brief visit  --  one which involved an absence of ten days or , at the outside , a fortnight  --  would not make much difference . But he very earnestly advised ... . It was , accordingly , for only a brief visit that Mabel and Bushrod came to Cindy Lou late that autumn ; and in spite of the fact that Miss Sophie and Clyde had both felt so sure , the previous spring , that she would never come there again , she came with them and so did Cousin Mildred . Mr. Stoddard once more offered his private car and , at the last moment , decided that he , too , would like to join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , this time , Clyde did not find their presence hard to accept . Even Bushrod , who revealed only his personable best , did not prove a thorn in the flesh ; Clyde could afford to let bygones be bygones , as far as his stepson was concerned , now that his grandson 's future was so amply safeguarded .  | Miss Sophie 's new will had been made , along the lines she and Clyde had discussed , and approved by all concerned . Clyde had also made a will , in which Cindy Lou was bequeathed outright to Larry . Bushrod , Mabel and Mr. Stoddard all seemed as well satisfied with Clyde 's arrangement for the future as they were with Miss Sophie 's . Even the provision that Amalfi and Sorrento should eventually revert to Larry , if Bushrod died without issue from a marriage sanctioned by the Church , seemed to create no hard feelings . Simpering , Mabel confided to Miss Sophie that she already had " expectations . " She had not wen a specialist yet , but she was almost sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Clyde with the slight twinkle for which he was learning to watch . He smiled and shrugged by way of reply . It did not greatly matter , after all , whether Larry eventually came into possession of the Virginia plantations ; he would have enough , and to spare , with Cindy Lou and Victoria . Besides , his grandfather was so delightfully preoccupied with the present stage of his development that it was all the easier to assume that the future would take care of itself . Larry was saying a few words now , adding to their number almost daily , and his physical development was more than keeping pace with his mental progress . He was walking , too , not staggering and stumbling about and then falling down suddenly and bursting into tears , but strutting sturdily from place to place with complete self-confidence and including everyone within his range of vision with a wide , disarming grin . His table manners were equally pleasing . He grasped his silver mug firmly in both chubby hands and , after quaffing from it , set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waved away all proffers of help in the use of his short-handled spoon . Miss Sophie declared that she had never seen so young a child show so much independence about feeding himself  --  and his food certainly agreed with him . His red cheeks glowed and his blue eyes sparkled beneath his unruly shock of black hair ; his build was sturdy , his stature surprising . He was really gorgeous looking , as well as remarkably intelligent ... . Exultantly , Clyde listened to her plaudits , feeling every word to be well merited . Cousin Mildred almost groveled with admiration ; and Mr. Stoddard , who had begun by saying gruffly that , while he did not actually dislike small children , he had never been able to understand the doting fondness they inspired , was soon observed to be making friendly , if covert , overtures to Larry ; within a few days , he , too , was shamelessly voicing his admiration of the " fine little boy . " Since Larry had inherited not only several silver mugs , but also two silver porringers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing along these lines which Mr. Stoddard could consistently offer in the way of a gift , and it was not in his nature to think of a rocking horse or a nest of blocks . But one day , with an air of great secrecy , he went to  | Baton Rouge and came back brandishing a passbook ; he had opened a savings account , in Larry 's name , with a hundred dollars . " Of course , I would n't have done it if there were any danger that I 'd be robbing my own grandchild , " he said importantly ; at which announcement , made to the family as a whole , Mabel blushed deeply and exclaiming , " Papa ! " hastened from the room . " Well , perhaps I should n't have mentioned such prospects , just yet anyway , " Mr. Stoddard added , looking after his daughter apologetically . " But what I mean is , there 'll be plenty for the next generation , no matter how many little youngsters are coming along . And the more the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement or any other that he made . In fact , the visit proved so unexpectedly harmonious in every way that Clyde , to his own surprise , suggested that it should be prolonged to include Christmas . He had ordered a tree from New Orleans  --  it was unthinkable that Larry should not have one , even if the year of mourning had not yet run its course . He was already old enough to delight in the star which would crown it , in the glittering tinsel and the multicolored balls with which it would be trimmed and the candles with which it would be lighted . Why , Clyde could remember that Cary , at approximately the same age ! . . . He was sure that Cary , and Lucy , too , for that matter , would want Larry to have his tree , that year and every year . Clyde also intended to have the house garlanded with scarletberried , silver-leafed youpon , just as Lucy had always done . Then of course the Negroes would expect , as usual , to make a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard by the river . In fact , he thought the bonfire had already been laid . And after the tree had been lighted and the gifts distributed , the well-dried reeds would be kindled and their every joint would burst with a report like a firecracker , so that for a few moments the blaze would rattle like a volley of musketry . Larry would be delighted with that , too  --  nonsense , of course it would not frighten him ! That child had never shown the slightest sign of fright about anything ! And nonsense , of course he could stay up long enough to see the bonfire ! It would not hurt him , for once , to go to bed an hour or so later than usual . Besides , they could have the tree by four o'clock ; at this time of year , it was already first evening by then and by six o'clock it was good dark ... . Miss Sophie and Cousin Mildred did not require much urging to remain for the celebrations thus outlined . But Mr. Stoddard , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the office ; and Mabel and Bushrod received a telegram from the architect , saying that one of the guest chambers would have to be sacrificed at Amalfi , if both his clients required dressing rooms and still insisted that he keep to the size and shape of the original house ; he would not take the sole responsibility for the decision . So three of the guests at Cindy  | deleted paragraph " This is going to mean war , Clyde . If it does  --  or rather , when it does  --  Virginians will hasten to offer their services to the government . In that way , at least , this conflict may be a blessing in disguise  --  it will open new wounds , but it will heal old ones which are worse . You will find the great survivors of the Confederate Army vying with each other to assure President McKinley of their support . And you will find the sons of the men who perished in the Lost Cause doing the same . Bushrod will certainly be among the first to take such action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone . " " You 're probably right about Bushrod . And right about going back to Sorrento , too , I 'm afraid . I hate to have you leave , Miss Sophie , I certainly do . But I can see how you feel . " Her first letter to Clyde after her return to Sorrento revealed the accuracy of her surmises . Bushrod had succeeded in joining the Volunteer Calvalry , under the command of General Joseph Wheeler , who had been a friend of both his father 's and his grandfather 's . Before long , Mabel had joined him in Tampa , where she obviously enjoyed herself immensely , sitting in a rocking chair on the veranda of the Tampa Bay Hotel , drinking enormous quantities of iced tea and chatting amicably with the wives , mothers and sisters of other volunteers . When the cavalry embarked for Cuba she waved a tearful farewell to the Allegheny and returned to Amalfi , where she sang " Good-by , Dolly Gray " on every possible occasion and dwelt upon the war news with ever-increasing satisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe " to accompany him when he pushed through the surf on the beach and landed at Daiquiri ; then Bushrod had gone with Wheeler on the first exploratory trip to the interior . When it became evident that the position assigned by General Shafter to the Volunteer Cavalry was such that it would probably be the last to see action , Bushrod was one of the officers to voice his dissatisfaction and to take part in a maneuver later described as " unique in military annals " : the one in which Wheeler took a thousand men , outflanked General Dawson and other divisions of his own army and provoked a fight with the Spanish troops . The indiscretion of this deed was  | matched by its daring and surpassed by its success ; every man who had taken part in it was acclaimed a hero . As the summer advanced , the acclamation in Mabel 's case became more and more emotional . The news reached Virginia that , in a moment of understandable excitement , Wheeler had forgotten in which war he was fighting and had shouted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When she heard this , Mabel stopped singing " Dolly Gray " and began to sing " Dixie . " Apparently her own memory was not wholly reliable , for she had been horn in New Jersey , but she had begun to resent any reminder of this ; she now said " cyar " for car and " gyarden " for garden and joined the Episcopal church . Bushrod was promoted from lieutenant to captain and she became convinced that not only Wheeler but every high-ranking officer from Shafter down was seeking her husband 's advice . Bushrod was cited for conspicuous gallantry under enemy fire and she began to visualize the ceremony at which the President would present him with the Congressional Medal , while she stood at his side . Bushrod was slightly wounded in the shoulder and she took to her bed and lay for days in a darkened room , considering whether it might not be well to order elaborate mourning , so that she would be properly prepared if she received an official notice of his death . His prompt recovery actually had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her patriotic pride and consuming anxiety were not confined to her husband ; she bewailed the suffering of all the " heroes " who shared his lot . One day she brought a copy of a certain prominent weekly to Sorrento and asked Miss Sophie if she had read the poem entitled , " The Yankee Dude 'll Do . " Miss Sophie confessed that she had not . " It 's terribly touching , " Mabel informed her . " I thought perhaps you might have missed it , so I brought the magazine with me . " Miss Sophie took the proffered periodical and began to read . " When Cholly swung his golf stick on the links , Or knocked the tennis ball across the net , With his bangs done up in cunning little kinks , When he wore the tallest collar he could get , Oh , it was the fashion then To impale him on the pen To regard him as a being made of putty through and through But his racquet 's laid away , He is roughing it today ; And heroically proving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about upon the yacht , Or drove out with his footman in the park ,  | His mama , It was generally thought , Ought to have him in her keeping after dark ! Oh , we ridiculed him then , We impaled him on the pen , We thought he was effeminate , and we dubbed him Sissy ' too ? But he nobly marched away , He is eating pork today , And heroically proving that the Yankee dude 'll do . " " It 's very amusing , is n't it ? " Miss Sophie said , looking up with a smile . " Amusing ! You do n't mean to say you think that 's a humorous poem ? " " My dear Mabel , how can I help thinking so ? He is eating pork today ' . . . he is , too . What do you suppose my husband and my sons and my son-in-law  --  and all the rest of the South , combatants and noncombatants for that matter , ate during the War Between the States ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they  --  I mean we ? eat mostly nowadays anyhow . " Miss Sophie handed the magazine back to Mabel without further comment . Mabel read the poem aloud to the end . " How they hurled themselves against the angry foe , In the jungle  --  in the trenches  --  on the hill ! When the word to charge was given every dude was on the go ? He was there to die , to capture , or to kill ! Oh , he struck his level when Men were called upon again To preserve the ancient glory of the old red , white and blue ! He has thrown his spats away , He is wearing spurs today , And the world will please take notice that the Yankee dude 'll do . " " He is wearing spurs today ! ' " Mabel repeated triumphantly . " The world will please take notice that the Yankee dude 'll do ! ' Well , the world is taking notice ! " She left the room abruptly , taking the magazine with her , and afterward she wrote to Bushrod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , to find that his grandmother had failed very greatly while he was gone . The war was already over when the letter reached him , and in his brief reply he said that in this case he would hasten home as soon as possible , in order to relieve Miss Sophie of all responsibility connected with the plantations . But Mabel could not wait for him to get there . Like hundreds of other hysterical women , she rushed to Camp Mohawk to welcome her returning hero ,  | thereby greatly adding to the difficulties with which General Wheeler was trying to cope . Conditions at camp were unquestionably bad ; there was a scarcity of water , inadequate sanitation , general sickness and discomfort . Mabel 's enthusiasm gave way to vituperation ; there was nothing she could say that was denunciatory enough to express her opinion of the President , the Secretary of War and all others in authority . With the least possible delay , she " rescued " her hero from the United States Army . Never , she declared , would she again consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his ancestral home , which she had made beautiful and kept inviolate for him . For the rest of their lives they would enjoy it in peace , meanwhile upholding the traditions of the past by taking their rightful places and playing their appointed roles among the country gentry . Unfortunately , Bushrod did not see eye to eye with Mabel about all this . He found her fervor irritating rather than stimulating ; and the hubbub which attended his homecoming had hardly subsided before country life began to pall on him ; he was relieved when an invitation arrived to accompany Wheeler on a tour of inspection through the South , which included a series of " jubilees " ; he was even more delighted when the opportunity arose to proceed with the general to Manila . Mabel was alone when she watched the new century come in , for Miss Sophie had not lived to do this and Bushrod did not return from the Philippines until nearly a month later . Then , after remaining in Virginia only long enough to make sure that everything connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on another series of " jubilees " which eventually took him to New Orleans . It was natural that from there he should go to Cindy Lou . Clyde freely acknowledged this , both to himself and to others ; but as one week succeeded another , and his stepson still seemed content to remain where he was , the old man began to wonder why Bushrod should find country life in Louisiana so much to his liking when , admittedly , he had found country life in Virginia boring . But Clyde did not dwell overmuch on this mystery , largely because at the moment he was preoccupied by the liquidation of the C &; L Navigation Company . When the final formalities in connection with this had been consummated , he returned from New Orleans in a state of almost overwhelming fatigue and depression . The fatigue was understandable enough ; his general health was good and his strength sufficed for the activities which came within the sphere of his regular routine ; but under any additional exertion , he tired very quickly . Admittedly , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression was inevitable , too . Of course , the C &; L Navigation Company had long since ceased to be anything more than a skeletal organization . He and Lucy had acted quickly upon their decision to sell all their barges and towboats and to confine their projects on the river to 322  | chartering steamers at cotton-shipping time . Seasonal revivals of this sort had defrayed the cost of a so-called office in the rear room of a St. Peter Street building , where an elderly , stoop-shouldered bookkeeper also acted as manager , accountant and janitor . Even when the railroads threatened to gobble up the little freight business there was left , a shipping contract with some planters at Hard Times Landing had produced enough revenue to provide both Lucy and Clyde with some special treat on the occasion of their wedding anniversary  --  the only one  --  at the only time  --  to which she would consent after they had agreed on their policy of retrenchment . After Lucy 's death , Clyde had put a similar sum aside for Larry 's education , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the C &; L had now almost reached the vanishing point ; and though the plantation was doing sufficiently well so that there was nothing to prevent him from carrying on the custom , he could no longer pretend that the money came from the moribund steamship company . In a sense , he felt that its house flag was a memorial to Lucy , even though it flew for only a brief period each autumn ; and he had a further sentimental attachment to the property since it was the only one which he and Lucy had owned jointly , under Louisiana law . But increasingly he found himself able to look hopefully toward the future rather than sorrowfully to the past . There was peace again after war and the world was beginning not only a new year but a new century . What better time could there be to close forever the door of that rear room , holding fast to the belief that somehow and somewhere another would open ? Over and over again , on the way back to Cindy Lou , Clyde told himself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been no better time . He had done the wise thing , the right thing , the thing Lucy herself would have been the first to advise . Even the stoop-shouldered bookkeeper could not be a logical object of sympathy ; he had a small pension as the veteran of a former war , and a widowed daughter was eager to have him make his home with her . Clyde who , as usual , had erred on the side of generosity when he severed his connections with his forlorn employee , had no reasons for self-reproach because the man was losing his means of livelihood . But the mood of depression continued . After Clyde reached home and responded , with as great a show of heartiness as he could summon , to Larry 's boisterous welcome , he stepped out on the gallery , as was still his nightly custom , and gazed for some moments at the anchor lights twinkling from the Lucy Batchelor . It seemed to him that they looked a little lower than usual . That might be merely imagination ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still he could not believe that anything was really amiss . At all events , he did not want to believe it . With a sigh , he turned back into the room . In accordance with his instructions , Larry 's evening meal had not  | been delayed until the uncertain hour of Clyde 's return and Tudie was now putting the little boy to bed . Bushrod , as was his habit , had gone to one of the neighboring plantations , where a Negro orchestra , alternating with a large music box , would provide tunes for dancing and where he would be the lion of the evening . But he had left the door of his room open and evidently he had left a window open also , for cold air was pouring out into the hall . Picking up a lamp , Clyde entered the empty chamber , prompted only by the idea that he would find the source of the draft and put an end to it . Once inside , however , he paused and looked around him . The room was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and setting down the lamp , Clyde began , almost automatically , to pick up the stray garments which were strewn about . He was orderly by nature , and years of association with Lucy , who had been the personification of daintiness , had increased his instinctive aversion to slovenly habits . Moreover , he realized that in Lucy 's lifetime no room in their house could possibly have looked like this in the evening ; however negligent its occupant , some servant would have put it in proper condition during the course of the morning and returned to it , later in the day , to rectify anything that might since have gone awry . He would have a word with Delphie , who was still supposed to give meticulous care to the upper story ; but there was no use in trying to do so tonight , as by this time she would have returned to the quarters . In any case , he was too tired , at the moment , to deal with a servant who had grown slatternly in her ways , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less bother to straighten things out himself . In order to see better , he pulled down the lamp which was suspended on metal chains from the center of the ceiling and lighted it . As he swung it back into place , his attention was caught by a rectangular packet , wrapped in brown paper , tied with white cord and tagged with a blue express label , which lay on the littered center table . Frowning with impatience at himself , he turned aside ; then , conscious of some strange compulsion , he looked back again ; there was something vaguely familiar about the appearance of the parcel , though he did not instantly realize what this was . Still acting almost involuntarily , he picked it up and scrutinized the label . " Ever-True Novelty Company , St. Louis , " he read with growing dismay and mounting rage . Then , his fingers shaking , he untied the knotted cord and laid back the wrapping . The brown paper unfolded to disclose two dozen decks of cards  --  the same kind which , over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped , by sleight of hand , into a friendly game which was taking place in the gentlemen 's cabin of a floating palace .  | His FIRST impulse was to throw the cards into the fire , leaving the empty , telltale wrappings to confront his stepson when Bushrod returned from his night of revelry . Indeed , Clyde had already picked up the decks and stridden toward the hearth , when sober second thought brought the realization that this was no way to deal with such in serious situation . What the best way might be could not instantly he determined ; but at least it was not through the destruction of material which might prove valuable evidence in an emergency . He carefully rewrapped the cards , restored the package to its original position and , making no further effort to create order out of the prevailing chaos , left the chamber and went slowly down the two flights of stairs which took him to the gaming room . Then he poured himself a stiff drink and sat , sipping it slowly , until he heard the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path . A moment later , Bushrod opened the door and walked in . Undeniably , he made an impressive showing . His unimpaired figure set off his uniform to immense advantage ; pallor gave a Byronic touch to his fine features ; and the dark circles under his eyes , far from suggesting dissipation , only added to this air of romanticism ; in every way he embodied the popular conception of a patriot who had suffered in a noble cause , and who was still suffering from the results of its hardships and its dangers , but who was making a valiant effort to conceal his pain under a cloak of buoyancy . And this was the dissembler who was accepting hero worship from a generous and cordial people at the same time that he was preparing to abuse their hospitality , so prodigally offered , with practices as adroit as they were dishonorable ! " Anything wrong ? " Bushrod inquired , casually acknowledging his stepfather 's greeting and turning toward the open cellarette . " Not that I know of . Why should there be ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . I do n't usually find you up at this hour . When I saw the light here , I thought something might be amiss with you . That 's why I came on to the gaming room , instead of going straight upstairs . " " I appreciate your concern for my welfare . I seem to remember another occasion when something rather different brought you to this room . You ca n't blame me if I still associate your presence here with a very unpleasant interview . Not that there 's any real connection , of course . Though , as a matter of fact , I 've got some money for you this time , too . " " Money ? " " Yes . I meant to give it to you in the morning , but if I do it now  | instead , we 'll be square that much sooner . I do n't know whether I mentioned that I intended going to New Orleans today . But that 's where I 've been . The C &; L Navigation Company was liquidated this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooley folks bought out the name and good will , leaving me what I 'd banked from last year 's shipping and paying a tidy enough sum for the contracts already signed  --  enough to cover the coming crop . " Bushrod , who had been fingering the glass he held and looking down at the drink he had poured himself , as if he enjoyed its mellow light , glanced up with a sudden show of interest . " And part of that tidy sum would be mine ? " he inquired . " Is that what you waited up to tell me ? I have n't wanted to hurry you , of course , but I 've been wondering when . . . . Do n't keep me in suspense . What does my share come to ? " " Six hundred and eighty-four dollars and some odd coppers . " " Oh ! " Bushrod looked down again and began to drum on the table , first with a slow , rhythmic movement and then with jerky irregularity . Clyde glanced at him contemptuously and , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . " When you say ' Oh ! ' like that , it 's evident you really mean , Is that all ? ' Yes , that 's all  --  and whatever it is , it 's just that much more than what , under the law , you can rightfully claim . Is that plain ? " " No , it is n't . If you think I mean to sit idly by and let you pass me a sugar-tit , you 're mightily mistaken . " " Very well . I 'll try to explain . The steamboat company was formed after your mother and I were married , and so became community property , jointly owned , half and half , by her and myself . It was the only piece of community property we owned . I bought the plantation before our marriage . Hence that was mine alone , because it was separate and paraphernal , under the law . " " I know . Under the Napoleonic Code which so amply assures protection for married women ! " The sneer in Bushrod 's tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stepfather 's . But Clyde answered quietly . " That is correct . It is also correct that the fifty thousand dollars I gave your mother at the time of our marriage was hers . I could not touch it or compel her to give me any part of it . " " Fifty thousand dollars ! " " Actually , more than that , by quite a good deal . Your mother had invested most of it very shrewdly , thanks to advice given her by Lamartine Vincent and others . She had done this without consulting me ; indeed , without my knowledge . I did not learn about the existence of that sum until you bled me of what was just about my last penny in ready cash . . . the last time we were together in this room . " " Then what 's all this palaver about six hundred dollars when I have  | coming to me a share  --  at least a quarter share  --  of more than fifty thousand ? " " You have coming to you exactly nothing , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! " " Indeed we shall . But it will be worth your while to hear me out , so that you understand what your position is . I had mortgaged everything I owned at the time of Cary 's wedding to build her a house and provide the sort of marriage she had counted on . Those loans were necessary because of an unlucky flier in the cotton market and the drain of our steamboat operations on the plantation earnings . So when you blackmailed me out of twenty thousand dollars I was ruined . That was the one thing I might have used to make a fresh start . And you robbed me of it . " " It was n't a fraction of what you should have given me , and you know it . Cary and I were to share alike as far as you were concerned , and .... " " We 'll discuss that some other time , if we must . Let me get on with this explanation of what utter and complete ruin I faced the day Cary and Savoie left on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might have been put  --  but for your mother . She had guessed something of how things stood with me , and offered to help . I told her the situation was beyond help , because I had exhausted my credit , was head over heels in debt , had mortgaged even the coming crops  --  and it was then that she gave me not only the money I had settled on her years before , but all the gains her wise investments and the income from these had added to the original sum . " " And you mean that was all swallowed up in your mismanagement ? " " From then on she and I managed together . Thanks to her , we paid the interest on my debts and made other pressing and immediate payments on principal . We bought some bitterly needed equipment ? and before the year 's end we were taking in more than we were paying out . Had she lived , not only this plantation , which she helped to redeem , but the money , which it would have repaid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not live . " " How does that affect the money that was due her ? " " It means that at the time of her death she and I were technically insolvent . It means our liabilities  --  our debts  --  were greater than our assets . It means that the community , such as it was , consisted of nothing but unpaid and unpayable debts . " " But they have been paid . " " Last year 's operation finally cleared away the last of the loans we made to meet our mortgages . For the first time , Cindy Lou was free and clear once more . But none of that , under the law , affects your mother 's share of the community . " " We 'll see about that , if there 's any law in the land . "  | " That we will . As a matter of fact , I had your mother 's succession opened before Judge Chretien . He appointed an appraiser , whose report on the insolvency of your mother 's estate has been filed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held up . So that if you want to contest them , you can do so , at any time . Meanwhile , the solvency of the plantation made it possible for me to liquidate the navigation company at last , and while no court could compel me to give you a share of that , I was and am ready to do so . " " While you pocket the rest ? " " For Larry . As his tutor . Under the agreement made with your grandmother at the time of  --  of the funeral  --  he will be my heir to all of Cindy Lou . " " Tutor ? " " Guardian then , if that term suits you better . But the legal guardian of a minor is called a tutor in Louisiana . I hardly thought a barrister would need to be told that . " " And since when , if it is n't asking too much , have you been made my nephew 's legal guardian ? " " I have n't been . That is , not officially . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written to Mrs. Vincent about the matter . Since the appointment wo n't be contested . . . . " " What makes you so certain of that ? " " Mrs. Vincent has answered my letter , assuring me that her husband is satisfied . As you know , he 's completely crippled . But , fortunately , his mind has remained clear . " " Is he the only one who might object ? " " I feel sure he is , since your grandmother had already assured me that she did n't . Do n't you think I 'm right ? " For a moment , their eyes met . Then Bushrod shrugged his shoulders , as if the matter were of no further interest to him . " About my share in the proceeds from today 's transaction , " he said . " I suppose there 's some sort of an accounting I could see , merely as a matter of form , naturally . But so as to verify the calculations . " " Certainly . In fact , Valois Dupre prepared a notarized attest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make such a demand and you 're entitled to an accounting . " " Of course I am . And while we 're on the point , I might add that I 'd like a similar statement from you , acknowledging my ownership in a part of this plantation . " " You do n't own any part of this plantation . You never will . You agreed , in writing , that if Amalfi and Sorrento were left to you outright , you would forgo any claim you might have to a share in Cindy Lou . " " As you said a few minutes ago , that is correct . ' Otherwise , you 've made a mistake , and a mighty big one . I own the entire back part of  | this plantation  --  that strip of land along Bayou Boisblanc , where Cary was always setting out to find treasure  --  and never did ! " From some where out in the garden came an unearthly shriek . Bushrod leaped up . " For God 's sake , why do n't you get rid of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would drive a preacher to drink ! " Clyde reached into a bowl which stood beside his empty toddy glass , took out two pecans , pressed them side by side into his hand and knotted his fingers over them until the shells burst noisily . Then , opening his fist , he looked at the fragments for a moment before picking out a few meats and putting them into his mouth . " Well now , you amaze me , " he said slowly . " Not by asking me why I do n't get rid of the peacocks . I know you do n't like them , but Larry does . So I think I 'll hang onto them . What you say about the land does come as a surprise though . I know for a fact that old Dupre did n't sell you the property and no one else had a right to . Or the title , either . I take it you 're not lying  --  this time . So somebody must have sucked you in . Instead of selling you a gold brick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the river , someone sold you a worthless deed to Cindy Lou . Well ! ... " " The state of Louisiana sold it to me ! I bought it for the taxes . And if you think you can make a joke out of that , you 're welcome to ! " " I wo n't try to make a joke out of it . But I 'd like to hear a little more about it . " Clyde reached for more pecans , cracked them as he had the others and sat thoughtfully chewing the meats . Bushrod 's sneering tone gradually rose to something very near a shout . " I 'd be very glad to explain . Dupre found a better gravel bed than yours on the Tangipahoa River  --  close to New Orleans , too , with a sand bar hard by . It 's easy to follow how he figured things out . Here was this parcel on Bayou Boisblanc that was n't worth a jitney to anybody , except as a gravel bed , and he did n't want to waste any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer to sell it back to you and no one else wanted it . So he decided to let the state take it over for taxes . My father-in-law  --  not to mention my dear wife  --  keep me pretty short ; but I manage , one way and another , to have some ready cash most of the time . So I had enough to buy in the Bayou Boisblanc property for the first verse and chorus of a short song . So it 's mine . Do you understand ? Part of Cindy Lou is mine ! And I dare you to put up a fourth interest in the rest of the plantation against that part in a poker game and see who picks up the marbles ! " " And supposing I wo n't ? After all , you just said that what you claim you own is worthless , except as a gravel bed . And it seems nobody wants a gravel bed there . " " I did say so and it 's true  --  generally speaking . But it happens to have two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want it  | so badly you can taste it . That was where you and Cary used to spend a lot of time , and anything connected with Cary , in your mind ... . She had a few faults , too , but we wo n't go into those . " " No . We wo n't go into those . " Clyde 's voice was still as even as before . Nevertheless , something in it caused his stepson to decide , rather hurriedly , that the last statement was conclusive . " Well , there may be treasure there , too , for all I know , " he said . " I mean the kind you and Cary were hunting for . But you 'll admit it 's pretty doubtful . However , there 's no doubt at all that tract of land could be a gold mine for me  --  not a gold brick or a diamond mine in Brazil , but a gold mine right here in Louisiana . I could start a gambling house on it  --  a saloon , a dance hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou , on what used to be Cindy Lou land . What would you say to that ? " Bushrod had expected that this suggestion would bring forth another cold statement made with menacing finality or even , this time , a violent outburst . Instead , Clyde merely shook his head and , for a few moments , seemed absorbed in thought . " I do n't know , " he answered eventually . " I suppose if I were a hero , ' I 'd say such a venture would be unbecoming an officer and a gentleman . As I 'm just an old river gambler , I look at it differently . I ca n't see why you bother to risk a gold mine , ' like what you 've described , against a share in the plantation . The gambling den , booze parlor and whore house would be a lot more profitable . The odds are n't good enough . " " Name your own odds , then . " " Very well . I 'll play you draw poker for your claim to the Boisblanc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolvency of your mother 's community estate at the time of het death , against an assignment to share all of Cindy Lou 's profits with you henceforth . " " An assignment to how much of a share ? " " A third of whatever 's turned over to Larry , or to me as his tutor , each year . Even you are bound to realize I would n't cheat him . " " But what 's the idea of acknowledging mother 's insolvency ? " " At the time your mother 's succession was appraised as insolvent , Judge Chretien wanted to have you present so that you could , if you wished , assume your share of the insolvent estate 's debts . I asked that the whole matter be held up until you returned . If you will sign an acknowledgment of that insolvency , and recognition of the fact that there was no community , judge Chretien can enter a judgment recording the fact that there is no other claimant to the estate , such as it was at the time of your mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all profits Cindy Lou will ever earn . What do you say ? "  | Bushrod made no attempt to conceal the sudden surge of elation that swept him to his feet . " Why , I say , done with you ! " he cried . " What 'll it be ? Winner-take-all on the first hand ? " " Winner-take-all on one hand 's no test of anything but luck . We 'll play for chips till one of us picks a hand by his own choosing to tap out the other player for everything . " " That 's all right with me . First hand , last hand , four-in-hand , any old hand . Trot ' em all out  --  foot , horse and heavy artillery and let the firing commence ! " " That ca n't all be done in a minute , as you ought to know after your recent glorious military career . Besides , there are documents to prepare and it 's rather late , as you said yourself when you came in . I 've been to New Orleans today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly where , but anyhow this is After the Ball is Over . ' I would n't say either one of us was in the best shape to play  --  even for peanuts . And this is n't going to be that kind of a game . What about tomorrow night ? " " I 'm taken for tomorrow . The Naquins and their cousins are making up a party to see the ball game at Donaldsonville and spend the night there . " " Day after tomorrow then . Any time you like , except tonight . " " Very well . Day after tomorrow . Though I warn you I 'll be on the lookout for any rigs you may try to run in the meantime . " " Run any rigs ? As if I 'd need to . But you 'd be well advised not to run any on me . I knew all the tricks long before you started your brief career at the Westmoreland Club . Well , that 's neither here nor there . I 'll be looking for you around eight Wednesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flickered along Spice 's back , but the motion was quite without conscious direction . His relaxed posture in the cabriolet was as easy as the mare 's gait , and she jogged along the familiar road , early Wednesday afternoon , just fast enough to outdistance the dust cloud raised by her hoofs from the powdery surface of the highway . Along one side of it ran the low , endless molehill of the levee . On the other lay the fields , separated here and there by arching , moss-hung live oaks , by the ornamental shrubbery of a plantation garden or by clustered cabins weathered to the same silvery gray as the cypress palings of the fences surrounding them . At one such cabin , Clyde drew Spice to an abrupt halt and banged the butt of his whip against the side of the cabriolet in a sharp tattoo . " May Lou ! " he called . " Ma'y Lou ! Rustle your bones ! " There was no immediate response , and he was on the point of raising a fresh halloo when an enormous Negress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her splayed feet were bare and a single shapeless garment of faded calico clung to the more voluminous bulges of her  | body . But a bright print cloth was tied about her head in an elaborately knotted tignon , and large loops of yellow metal dangled from the lobes of her ears . " Bless Jesus , Mr. Clyde , you'se too welcome , suh , " she beamed , " even iffen mah house is that upset I could faint . I could so . Do leave me unhook dis gate .... " " No need , Ma'y Lou . I 'm only passing by . But I 'll be back directly , and when I come I want you to have a sugar-tit for me . " The big Negress cupped one fat elbow with her palm , whipping the other hand over her mouth as she cackled shrilly . " No sugar-fit couldn ' be for you , suh , no , " she giggled , sputtering . " You just a'funnin ' with old Ma'y Lou , dat you is . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with an answering grin . " I want a sugar-tit and what I need it for does n't concern you the first particle . " " Does you mean just a plain , everyday sugar-tit lak us gives our babies , Mr. Clyde ? " " Exactly . And I 'll be back for it in less than no time , so stir your stumps . " " Yessuh , I sho'ly will . As soon as ever you gets back , suh , I has a sugar-fit tied for you . " Clyde nodded a good-by , twitched the reins and clicked a command to Spice . Then , as the mare resumed her peaceful jogging , he continued along the river road to the Grand Hotel Pierre Chanet . This hostelry had prospered greatly as river traffic fell off , for canvassers and drummers  --  Knights of the Grip , as they liked to call themselves ? now went about the countryside in their own buggies , because steamboats were so few and far between and so unreliable of schedule . The Pierre Chanet housed a good poker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling salesmen found it pleasant to while away the Saturday-to-Monday tedium there . This meant excellent business for the bar , as well , and here Clyde , having secured Spice to the worn cypress arc of the hotel 's hitch rack , purchased a deck of cards . " Just one , thanks , Celestin . Steamboats , either pink or blue . It makes no difference which . " He found Ma'y Lou waiting for him at the weathered fence , a clean , neatly tied bit of white cloth that looked like a miniature rag doll held proudly in her great black hand . Tucking it into the pocket of his gray moleskin vest , he gave her a silver dollar , nodding acknowledgment of her shrill thanks and a broad jest to the effect that the older the stallion , the prouder he be 's to claim ary wood 's colt as his own get . Then , chuckling as he thought of Ma'y Lou 's parting comment , he sat back in the cabriolet , relaxed , while Spice drew it homeward through the deepening dusk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue Lucy 's pleasant practice , Clyde had discontinued the ceremonious serving of afternoon tea . Instead , he had a hearty supper , early enough for Larry to he at the table with him ; and while Delphie had grown slack in her ways , Belle , aged and slow as she was , had not lost the skill that went with having " a free hand and no conscience " when it came to cooking . She had never yet sent in a meal that was not a credit to her and tonight it was actually something of a feast . Dumaine , the overseer , had sent a couple of fine green trout to the Big House and these had been baked in a sauce piquante ; fluffy white rice and Whippoorwill peas accompanied these . So did a mixture of late-gathered winter greens , which had been simmered with a hunk of fatback in an iron pot , after leaves of sweet basil , finely minced with bird's-eye peppers , and a couple of garlic pods , stuck with cloves , had been added for seasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this piece de resistance and crisp waffles with pecan cuite followed it . When he had finished , Clyde pushed back his chair from the table with a gusty sigh . " A man my age has n't any business eating that much rich food , " he said . " Remember that , Larry , when you get to be as old as I am . From the way you scoop everything up now , it looks as if you might need a word of warning . " Larry 's hearty laugh showed that he understood his grandfather was " funning " even though he did not know what all the words meant ; and after the two had hugged each other hard , he ran noisily off to Tudie . Clyde looked after him dotingly and turned to Zack . " Bring my coffee down to the gaming room , " he said , " and light a fire in both the heating stove and the fireplace . It was hot enough through the day , but it 's turned off chilly . . . . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when he comes in , tell him I 'm waiting for him . " " Ah done light the fires already , suh . Ah figured as how you might Ise wantin ' ' em . " The gaming room 's warmth was benign ; the crackle of wood in the grate mingled cheerfully with the purr from the draft of the heating stove . The large central lamp of the girandole had been lighted and its height so adjusted that only the top of the card table came within its cone of radiance ; the rest of the room remained intimately wrapped in semidarkness . With an increasing sense of well-being , Clyde let himself down into an armchair facing the fireplace . On the serving stand at his elbow , Zack placed a tray bearing a small silver coffeepot , a  | bowl of cracked loaf sugar , a decanter of brandy and one eggshell cup , which Clyde promptly filled with the fragrant black brew . Then , into the bowl of a coffee spoon , he dropped a small chunk of sugar , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roseau sliver to the coals and quickly applied the tiny flame to the sugar . A blue light clothed its crest for an instant , before sliding down to envelop the sides and dance lightly over the bowl of the spoon . Clyde held the small flambeau steady until the sugar lump collapsed with a sirupy bubbling , then quenched it all in the coffee , stirring the aromatic mixture and sipping it with lively relish . " Only one , tonight , " he said to Zack . " But wait in the kitchen , even after Mr. Bushrod gets here . I might be wanting you later on . " His sensation of well-being continued to increase . It would not matter how soon Bushrod came ; on the contrary , the stage had been set for hours now and he was eager for the play to begin . He had realized , from the beginning , that whatever methods his stepson had in mind , the latter must have taken the precaution of working these out before he issued his challenge . Otherwise , he would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards and chips , kept on an inlaid rack in the gaming room , had revealed nothing out of the ordinary . The cards were the same Steamboat and Congress decks Clyde always kept there and most of them were new , their revenue stamps still intact . So much for that . An equally detailed examination of Bushrod 's room had likewise brought nothing of a suspicious nature to light . The package from the Ever-True Novelty Company , which Clyde had accidentally found on his return from New Orleans , was gone ; but that was to be expected . Bushrod had , no doubt , taken its contents with him when he went to Donaldsonville for a " ball " game and to spend the night and the following day with the Naquins and their cousins at an adjacent plantation . This interval would certainly be largely given over to poker . But it was here at Cindy Lou that Bushrod was preparing for the supreme gamble of his career ... . The answer to the puzzle was so simple that Clyde was astonished he had not found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had passed a sleepless night , restless and irritated at his failure to solve the mystery , that he suddenly did so : the package of his discovery could not have been the first which had come to the house . There must have been at least one other  --  perhaps several others  --  and from one of these had come the decks which Bushrod intended to use now . He was far too shrewd to suppose that his stepfather would accept any he might bring into the gaming room at the last moment . The marked cards must be there already , and so placed that Clyde himself would unwittingly introduce them into the game . But he had examined the contents of  | inlaid rack and everything had appeared to be in order . Hold the deal a moment . . . . Appeared to be . . . . Appeared to be . . . . Why that must be it ! Clyde had dressed hurriedly , returned to the gaming room and , from the inlaid rack , had again taken an unopened deck and peered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Finally he had sawed through this with his thumbnail , pulled out the contents and carefully lifted the flaps of their waxy wrapping with the blade of a penknife . No more than a glance was needed to reveal that the apparently normal latticework pattern on the backs of the cards was marked with the familiar Ever-True design , so that anyone who knew the key could read the value of each card as clearly from the back as from the front . But the unbroken government seal ? . . . Of course ! Bushroil would have in his possession forged  --  or even stolen  --  revenue stamps , to be applied over what was left of the torn seals after marked decks had been substituted for the original contents of the genuine Steamboat or Congress boxes . An old , old dodge . But it had come within a hairsbreadth of taking him in . Well , forewarned was forearmed . A skilled player , knowing that marked cards which he could also read were being used against him , enjoyed a tremendous advantage over a cheat who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clyde wondered what sort of a deal Bushrod planned to use in the crucial hand . The marked cards had been rearranged ; the cold deck was already stacked . And Bushrod would deal that hand . He must have arranged the packs for himself to handle with a false shuffle , being prepared to reverse Clyde 's cut when he packed the cards . Clyde took two poker hands off the top of the substituted deck , turning the cards of one up . Sure enough , there it was . The hand that would be dealt him showed a pat full house  --  three queens and a pair of fours . Bushrod 's hand held two kings , two tens and the five of diamonds . Obviously , he had assumed Clyde would stand pat . Bushrod would discard one on the draw ? the five of diamonds , naturally  --  and would receive . . . Clyde flipped over the next card  --  a third king . Thus Bushrod 's three kings and two tens would top Clyde 's three queens and a pair of fours . Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by it . Clyde riffled through the deck to draw out the fourth queen from far beneath the carefully stacked hands that topped it . Taking this card to his office , he slipped a fine-pointed new steel nib into his penholder and diluted a few drops of red ink with water from the cedar drinking keg . Turning the pink lattice of the card 's back uppermost , he set to work with knife point and pen . Progress was slow ; it was achieved by no more than a touch of blade or pen point at a time . But when he had finished , the markings on the back of this  | queen of clubs showed it to be a four ; and though his eyes were tired , they twinkled as he returned to the gaming room and substituted this queen for one of the two fours that were to have been dealt him . Otherwise , he left the deck arranged exactly as he had found it , rewrapping it in the original glassine cover which he closed fast with a drop of mucilage from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacing or repairing the broken revenue stamp , after he had slipped the rewrapped cards back into their flat box . But this was no great matter since it was virtually certain Bushrod would call for a new deck and ask him to take it from the rack ; otherwise there would have been no reason to substitute " cold " marked decks for all the genuine ones in the rack . Moreover , Clyde could always make an adequate pretense of breaking an already broken seal . Certain of his ground , Bushrod would not be watching closely at that stage , in any case ... . Replacing the deck in its rack , Clyde went through a rear passage to the kitchen garden where a bell swung from the top of a slender pole . He gave its cord a sharp pull and , as the bell pealed , a stableboy came running quickly toward him . " Hitch Sugar or Spice to the cabriolet , " he directed . " It does n't matter which , but be quick about it . " What a pity it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this rare jest could not be shared . So Bushrod did not mean to have anyone fob off a sugar-tit on him , eh ? The joke was really too good for a man to keep to himself . Clyde went into the garden and plucked a wine-colored , belated bloom for the buttonhole of his jimswinger ; then , returning to the house for his Stetson , he cocked this at a rakish angle . It certainly made a man feel young again to whet his wits . He took the reins from the small darky , gave the cabriolet 's spidery wheels an approving glance and set off in the direction of Ma'y Lou 's cabin and the Grand Hotel Pierre Chanet . This had been several hours ago and now he was seated in the big armchair , gazing quietly at the embers and sipping his coffee with that increasing sense of contentment . He was still sitting there when Bushrod came in . " People , people , it 's cold on the river ! " he exclaimed , spreading his hands to the welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch of Naquin 's , the wind cut through me straight to the marrow . " " I expected you rather earlier . " " God almighty ! You ought to know how these Creoles are . They 've got kinfolk back of every tree and tucked away in every fence corner . Before we could think of leaving Donaldsonville , we had to pay courtesy calls on Cousin Constantine and Cousin Clovis and Parrain This and Marraine That , because any relative who was overlooked would be mortally hurt . But here I am , better late than never , I reckon ,  | and ready to receive the warm and affectionate welcome of a stepsire who loves me as though I were Bronze John 's own twin . " " Coffee ? " " No , thank you just as much . But a hooker of blue ruin would be gratefully received as a sovereign preventer of la grippe . " Clyde waved his hand toward the rosewood cellarette . " You 'll find whatever you need there , I think , " he said . " And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't object to postponing the game until ? " " Hell no ! " Bushrod tossed off a small glass of bourbon , neat , and smacked his lips . " You said you expected me earlier . I wo n't hold you up any longer . Bring on the cards and counters . " Clyde rose , placed the rack on the table , raised the cover and began to count out chips . " I should think a couple of hundred dollars would be aplenty , " he suggested , with just enough of a rising inflection to leave the decision to Bushrod . " I mean for the warm-up . One of us will probably make it winner-take-all before it 's used up . " Clyde produced a worn pigskin portmanteau from the inner pocket of his coat and extracted a folded sheet of paper from it . " Here 's the statement , all in good shape , " he said . " Whatever money is paid to Lawrence Vincent 's account from Cindy Lou Plantation , through sale , rent or crops , whether paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sum equal to one third of every such payment is to be remitted within seven days to Bushrod Page or to his lawful agent . ' " Clyde tossed the sheet across the lighted table to Bushrod , who scanned the document briefly and shrugged . " I expect it 'll hold water , " he observed . He scraped a chair across the floor to the table and sat down . " All right . Shall we start the sociable ? " " When I have your written agreement , " Clyde answered , still standing . " This will be table stakes . Until the paper is with the chips in front of you , we do n't turn the first card . " " What the hell 's eating you ? How could I chiprack you on a proposition like that ? " " I 'll never know , because you wo n't have a chance to show me . Stop playing the gentleman , will you ? I 'm all the audience there is this time . Bring what you need in the way of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write me a signed statement of your promise to leave and another stating your disclaimer to any part of this property . Put those statements with your chips , and afterward we 'll play . Not before . And we wo n't play with any cards of yours . I 've taken the time and trouble to go to the Chanet and buy a new deck . You need n't bother asking if I do n't trust you . The answer is I sure as hell do n't . I would n't trust you as far as I could carry the river in my vest pocket . " Bushrod rose , without answering , and , going into the office , brought  | back a pad of ruled foolscap paper , a pen and a small bottle of purplish ink . Then he sat down and wrote scratchily , signed the two documents with a flourish and read them aloud . Clyde nodded and Bushrod ripped the paper from its pad , passed the sheets quickly back and forth over the lamp chimney several times to dry the ink , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " Well , not exactly . But we can start playing any time . Here 's the deck . Shuffle it yourself . Then we 'll cut . High deals . " Without a word , Bushrod opened the new deck , stripped the glassine wrapping from the cards , pushed it and the two jokers to one side and shuffled dexterously , riffling the cards with practiced skill . At length , he spread them in an arc across the baize centerpiece . Clyde turned a jack to Bushrod 's six of hearts . As he shuffled the cards anew , his expression was as blank as a newly whitewashed wall ; but behind that imperturbable mask he was wondering by what means Bushrod would substitute one of the marked decks for this unmarked one . He was not left long in doubt . On the first deal , Bushrod tossed two ten-dollar chips into the pot , along with two cards . " I 'll take a couple off the top , if you feel like seeing how the luck 's running tonight , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed through the quiet night , he exclaimed , " God damn those peacocks ! Every last one of them would be in the market for a new neck if I had my say-so . " " But you have n't . As for this hand , I would n't care for any part of it , " Clyde observed placidly . " I would n't choose to draw against you this time . " " You mean all I win is my own double sawbuck ? " Bushrod asked testily . " And with three natural aces to draw to ? " He made as if to display the cards , but , as though goaded beyond endurance , he tore them across and threw the pieces on the floor . Then he did the same with the two he had discarded , snatching them back from the table 's center . " That calls for a new deck . And , by the way , I 'm not afraid to play with your cards , even if you are scared of mine . Pick any deck you please out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not so well done , reflected Clyde behind the blank front of his poker face . To be sure , tearing up an ill-favored hand and demanding a new deck was a traditional gesture . But a cleverer sharp would then have offered to bring in cards of his own . When Clyde demurred , as he was reasonably certain to do , Bushrod could have waved aside the objection with a casual , " Hell , if you 're all that worried , I 'm agreeable to playing with your cards . Anything for a quiet life . " But he was too impatient for his grand coup to let the suggestion come from his opponent . Clyde lifted the cover of the container and , apparently without look-  | ing , withdrew from it one of the decks . Running his thumbnail swiftly along the upper edge of this , as if he were slitting the revenue stamp , he took out the cards and shoved them , still in their glassine wrapper , across the table to Bushrod , who removed the wrapper and the two jokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , crisply , apparently shuffling them with his swiftly moving fingers , before offering the deck for a cut , in a way that suggested he half expected the tender would be waived . But Clyde reached across and divided the pack . He appeared wholly intent on stacking his chips in more meticulous alignment ; nevertheless , he caught every detail of Bushrod 's reversal of the cut : the tip of the left little finger inserted between the two portions of the deck , the swift kit-hand flip under cover of the right hand , which was brought forward as though merely to take the first card in making the deal . He picked up the hand Bushrod dealt him , squeezed the edges cautiously to inspect it , closed it into a book and laid this face down upon the table before him . There lay the four queens and the single four he had Arranged in this deck earlier in the day . " I 'll tap you on this first hand , " he said quietly . " Do you want me to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , shifted in his chair and otherwise made a show of indecision and doubt . " That means your hand 's pat , " he said musingly . " What a hell of a note ! A pat hand on the first deal , with me over a barrel , because I ca n't lay down my hand , however sorry it might be . And I do n't mind saying it 's a sorry two pair  --  the hardest hand in the deck to improve . So it makes no difference when you tap me . " " What makes you so all-fired sure my hand 's pat ? " Clyde challenged . Beyond the cone of illumination , the room still lay in shadow . Then a sudden jet of yellow flame hissed from a dying ember and subsided into a dusky glow . Clyde again picked up his cards and studied them , as though seeking reassurance . Apparently still preoccupied with his thoughts , he arranged his cards face down before him , one beside the other , so that each back was plainly visible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " he argued pensively , " or I might have nothing but a rinctum tiddy  --  a cooler  --  a strong case of measles , having overlooked my hand , maybe . You 'd never believe a body 'd be gambler enough to shoot the moon on a chance . That 'd tempt me to run a windy on you just for the hell of it . But whether the hand 's pat flush , or four of a kind or just a wild dream makes no difference . So put up your poke right now if you aim to draw cards . " Bushrod had darted a surreptitious glance at the face-down row in front of Clyde . There could have been no error . Nevertheless , he felt the cold clutch of doubt . If by some wild mischance anything had gone wrong .... But no , the marks showed that his stepfather had a full  | house : three queens and a pair of fours . Yet he swallowed several times before tossing his statements on the green centerpiece in front of Clyde . " Domino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now  --  how many cards ? " He picked up the deck and held it toward Clyde , waiting with his right hand poised as if to deal on demand . " I 'm pat . You were right . I 'll play what I 've got . " " I reckoned as much , " Bushrod answered rather smugly . " Neither do I think you 're running a windy . That 's why I 'm going to draw one card to my two pair . If what you 've got is a straight , a flush or a small full house , I can improve enough to take the pot . If you 've got four of a kind , or a straight flush though , I ca n't . Here 's what I 'm drawing to ? kings and tens . " He faced up his hand and flipped the fifth card , the five of diamonds , to one side and lifted the top card slowly from its resting place on the deck until he could read it . Then he turned it over and brought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the wood . " And a king it is ! " he said exultantly . " Twenty sweet miles of railroad track and three kings to walk them ! " He cast a triumphant glance at the backs of the cards still aligned in a row before Clyde . " Well , speak up . Which of us sleeps on the levee tonight ? Show me that pat hand of yours ! " Clyde faced up his cards one at a time : the queen of hearts , the queen of diamonds , the queen of spades , the four of hearts . . . . He waited , looking up to watch Bushrod 's face as the last card was turned : the one whose marked back proclaimed it a four , but whose face revealed the stylized mirror images of the queen of clubs , four-petaled blossom in hand . " Why , Bushrod ! " he said mildly . " What in time 's the matter with you ? You 're the color of a toad-frog 's belly . " " B-b-but . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the point of reaching across the table for the queen . " I mean .... " " I know exactly what you mean . " For the first time since the game began , Clyde smiled . He turned the queen and skimmed it across the table so that it came to rest , back up , in front of Bushrod . " You mean the mark on the hindside showed it to be a four-spot ? Those Ever-True people must be getting downright careless . " " You  --  you 've had that card right from the start ! " " I expect I must have . While you were visiting the Naquins , I did a little prospecting  --  and bless me , if I did n't trip right over a cold deck , all stacked for the whiskery old caper that went out of style about the time McClellan was beaten for president . So I took the notion of playing fox to your possum . Well , you know as much about the rest as I do . " He pushed the cards aside and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . " I 've had a very pleasant evening , " he continued . " It 's been worth a little trouble to show you that you 'd  | better not step out of your class  --  when it comes to gambling or anything else . While we 're at it , let 's get one fact mighty clear : whether you believe it or not  --  and on that point I do n't give the first God cl.unn  --  I 've never cheated you out of anything that belonged to you and I would n't have done so this time . I made a promise to myself , as well as one to your mother  --  well , never mind about that  --  you would n't understand anyway . But you did n't have anything for a stake tonight . Your renunciation of a share in the property is no more than you had already agreed to when your grandmother made you sole heir to both Amalfi and Sorrento . And your claim to the Boisblanc acreage is only lettuce and wind . You 've got no more title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STILLNESS SUDDENLY closed in upon the room , and in the semidarkness beyond the sharply edged cone of radiance , this silence became something almost palpable . At his stepfather 's final words , Bushrod had glanced swiftly down toward the folded sheet of foolscap that had just been returned to him , conscious that his eyes might betray his thoughts . Now he tapped it lightly against the polished edge of the table . " What you said does n't make sense , but you evidently believe it does , " he remarked evenly . " I mean about my claim to the Boisblanc acreage being nothing more than lettuce and wind . " " Quite so , " Clyde agreed . " And you gave this back to me " ? Bushrod lifted the folded sheet and let it drop again ? " of your own accord . I did n't so much as ask you for it . " " No , you did n't . " " Which means that even if you beat me at my own game  --  and you ( lid , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any such terms , " Bushrod went on , almost as though musing aloud . " So you gave it back to me . Is that right ? " " That 's about what it amounts to . " " In other words , whatever title I may have to the Boisblanc tract , good , bad , indifferent , worthless or whatever , that title is still mine . Do you agree to that ? " " Yes indeed . You could n't be more welcome to whatever claim you think you have , not if I handed it to you on a silver platter with sauce  | piquante . Because what you call your title ' is still nothing but lettuce and wind and I tell you so plainly . " " And I tell you plainly it 's as good as gold . After all , I know something about land titles  --  you seem to have forgotten that I 'm a lawyer . And titles do n't come any sounder than tax titles . I bought that Boisblanc acreage from the state of Louisiana . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go that far with you . But fortunately or unfortunately  --  whichever way you choose to look at it  --  the title the state of Louisiana gave you was n't worth the match you 'd use to set fire to the paper it 's written on  --  at least , if you took a notion to burn it up . " " That 's impossible . The state is a sovereign and .... " " If you 've a mind to listen , I can explain to you . If not , that suits me , too . " " I 'll lose nothing by listening , I expect . Besides , I 'm interested to know just what sort of yarn you 've cooked up in an effort to prove that a title direct from the state itself is n't worth the price of a matchstick . " Bushrod 's chair made a scraping sound on the furbished brick flooring as he pushed away from the table and crossed one leg over the other . He still held the folded paper in his hand and he now began tapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , " Clyde began . " Just one sorry little mistake , made by a clerk , set everything topsy-turvy . You know how it is with a file of dominoes : maybe you knock down only one , but ii that knocks down the next one and so on until they 're all flat . This i is something like that . " " Dominoes has n't ever been my game . And so far , I have n't heard a word to prove that a tax title is n't as sound as a nut . " Bushrod was smiling now , and his smile was condescending rather than mocking . He continued to tap his knee with his folded paper , but there was still nothing in the gesture that suggested impatience . " I 'll have to go back quite a ways in order to explain , so I 'm glad that you do n't seem to be in a hurry , " Clyde remarked equably . " The mix-up began right after your sister got back from Europe , early in ' 96 . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of her marriage ? well , you ought to know something about that . I still was n't out of the woods a year later , though your mother 'd helped me every way she could , and by scrimping and saving we 'd got to the place where we could see daylight ahead . In fact , we knew that if we could just get hold of a little more ready cash , to make some improvements .... " " Were n't we supposed to be talking about tax titles ? I mean about my purchase of the Boisblanc part of Cindy Lou at a tax sale two years ago ? " " Is that when you think you bought it ? "  | " Think hell ! I did buy it ! " " All right . We 'll come to that presently . About that Boisblanc tract now . Old Valois Dupre had been pestering me for a long while to sell it to him . I never would listen , because I had the idea Cary set reat store by that particular tract . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though she were n't even interested in It . So , as your mother and I needed the ready cash to make those Improvements , I sent word to Valois Dupre that I was ready to sell him the gravel land . " " Well , I know about that already . I know he bought it from you and I know he let the taxes lapse . " " So he did , " Clyde interrupted quietly . " But still they did n't lapse . That 's what I 'm trying to explain . " " He did . . . they did n't . . . what sort of talk is that ? What 's it all leading up to ? " The tapping had become a little more insistent and one slender leg was now swinging back and forth over the other . The smile was gone . Iiushrod 's face , as well as his gestures , reflected increasing annoyance . " You 'll see , if ever you 'll hear me out , " Clyde answered , still imperturbably . " Dupre bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was agreed that he 'd assume that year 's taxes  --  due in ' 97 . Everything was shipshape and the transfer of title to Dupre was recorded at the courthouse . The cash we got out of the sale put Cindy Lou over the hump . We knew then  --  your mother and I  --  that , barring the worst kind of luck , we could pull through . And that summer we did n't have to squeeze the pennies quite so hard before we 'd let one go . " " I still say all this is beyond the point . The point is that you did sell that Boisblanc tract to a man named Dupre , who let the taxes lapse . " " I 'm coming to that now . During the late spring of ' 96 , we were all more or less upset by Cary 's illness and the preparation for Armande 's wedding and the De Chanets ' visit . Then in the midst of this general confusion , Dupre came to tell me about the other gravel bed he had found  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boisblanc piece . He offered to sell my land back to me , then and there . And I had to tell him I was too hard up to buy it . " " Why , you just said you 'd reached the point where you did n't need to pinch pennies any longer ! " " I said we 'd got to the point where we did n't have to pinch them quite so hard  --  to the point where we thought we could pull through . But we still had to keep on pulling . So I refused Dupre 's offer , even though he went as far as to say he 'd sell the land back to me for a dollar and lend me the dollar to buy it with ! He kept insisting that the extra profit he 'd make out of the new gravel bed would more than make up for the cost of mine and that he really wanted me to have that . "  | " And still you refused ? " " I expect you would n't understand . But yes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do to keep the rest of Cindy Lou going and lay by l enough for taxes on that . Valois understood how I felt , even if you do n't . But he said that since I did n't want the property the state could have it , for all he cared . He was going to abandon it . It was n't a bit of use to him , and he did n't propose to worry with bookkeeping on it . He had n't paid the first year 's taxes yet and he was n't going to pay them  --  those or any others . " " So we 're coming to it at last . He did n't pay the taxes , did he ? " " Indeed he did n't . And if one lone clerk in the office of Fernand Lemieux , the old assessor , had n't made a mistake , your title to that Boisblanc property might have been worth gambling for in dead earnest . But see if you can follow me now : I told you the sale of that Boisblanc land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchaser assumed the ' 96 taxes . " " Yes and that he did n't pay them . That he never paid them or any other taxes on the property . " " That is correct . But the tax bills were sent to him . The clerk in Lemieux 's office saw that a proper entry was made on the books , so that the sheriff sent the notices to Valois Dupre at New Orleans ? I assume you know that the sheriff collects taxes in Louisiana  --  the assessor merely computes them . " " And if those notices were duly sent , what was the mistake ? " " The clerk made the mistake . He neglected to make a second entry to the effect that my tax bill should be cut by the amount of Dupre 's . So , in April of ' 97 , when they sent Dupre his bill , they also sent me mine at the old figure  --  the figure based on my ownership of the entire Cindy Lou Plantation , Boisblanc and all . " " And you paid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Convent and raise holy hell until somebody corrected the mistake ? What sort of a Simple Simon do you take me for ? You ought to know I would n't swallow a yarn like that ! " Bushrod 's voice rang with the contemptuous anger which he was no longer making the slightest effort to control or conceal . He leaped to his feet and leaned across the table , gripping its polished edge and looking down at his stepfather with an expression of sneering hatred . Clyde neither moved nor answered and , just at that moment , Zack entered the gaming room with an armful of firewood . The Negro plied an iron bar among the embers and laid fresh bolts of wood against the smoldering backlog . Then he glanced at Clyde , as if in silent inquiry . But the latter shook his head without speaking and Zack withdrew . It was not until the sound of his footsteps had died away in the distance that Clyde answered his stepson 's outburst . " I said I would explain to you . Also , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed me . Yes , I paid the full amount . That was right after your mother , your sister and Savoie Vincent had died horrible deaths . It was n't until after your grandmother left Cindy Lou that I so much as looked at my books . Up to then , I was just going through some motions . When I got back to realities and went over my accounts , I saw right away that there must have been some mistake . But as long as the money had been paid , I decided to let matters stand as they were for the time being . I still was n't in any mood or in any shape to take on extra problems . " " Though only the summer before , you would n't put out so much as one lousy dollar to buy back the land ! " Clyde looked up quickly . " I did n't propose to be the object of Valois Dupre 's charity , then or at any time , " he rapped out . " I 'm neither a panhandler nor a blackmailer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , what the hell ! I 've already said there are things you would n't understand . But maybe you can understand when I say that we did a lot better in ' 96 than we had ciphered we might . I mean your mother and I. Before the harvest , we could n't say more than that we saw daylight ahead . But we had a bumper yield of cane that year and got top prices for our sugar , even allowing the Vincents their toll for grinding and granulating . Our tobacco crop did better still . Everything was coming our way at last . By the spring of ' 97 we not only saw daylight ahead , we were out of the woods . It really looked as if life would be wonderful again . . . until the fire . . . . " Suddenly , his voice broke . But almost immediately it was under control again . " That 's got nothing to do with you , " he continued harshly , glowering at Bushrod . " But it does concern you that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou , those on the Boisblanc tract were never in arrears . " " That 's only your view of it . " " No , it 's been generally admitted . When old Fernand Lemieux finally found out about the mistake in his records , he almost had a spasm . He said he would do anything I wanted him to , in order to get everything straightened out . He fired the clerk who was responsible for it . He offered to have the sheriff send Valois Dupre a receipt for all past-due taxes . All in all , he took on so bad that I told him to wait until he got quieted down before we tried to get things fixed up . And the next day he dropped dead of a heart attack . " " So the matter was not straightened out . That 's exactly what I 've been saying . The land was advertised for sale by the state and I bought it . " " As I told you before , you had reason to think so . But I would n't advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time I was in New Orleans I called on Valois and explained to him what had happened . I also  | said I was ready to buy back the Boisblanc tract for what he had paid me in the first place . And he said no , he had made me a price on it , which was one dollar , no more and no less , and he would stick by that price . If I cared to take it for that it would be a deal . He had got mighty rich by that time , dealing in building materials , and his schooners were bringing in shell and sand and gravel from over the lake to his yards on the New Basin Canal . I knew he meant what he said , just as I had , so I finally bought back the Boisblanc tract . " " For a dollar ? " " That 's right . " " And would it be too much to ask what became of your high and mighty notions of not taking handouts , or whatever you called them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had the money to pay for it . and that made all the difference . This was in the early spring of ' 98 , another good crop year ; it was no longer a case of having to take the land for a dollar because that was all I had . If you ca n't see what a difference that 'd make , there 's no use talking about that end of it . " " Suit yourself . But what you 've said still does n't alter the fact that a year later the high sheriff advertised the land to be sold for delinquent taxes and that I bought it  --  and own it . " " That 's the last domino that fell . Lemieux , the old assessor , was dead . His clerk , the one who made the mistake , was fired . Young Sigur Hymel , who was elected to succeed Lemieux , and his staff did n't know anything about all this . All they knew about was what stood in the office records . And , according to those records , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  were in arrears . So Hymel handed the sheriff a complete list of what should be advertised in the Regisseur du St. Jacques to be sold for taxes . Naturally , if any of those properties had been in my name I 'd have seen the notice , or someone would have told me about it . But it was n't . The name of Valois Dupre did n't mean the first thing to any of the folks around here and I did n't look at the list myself , for the simple reason that all my taxes were paid . I was n't hunting around to grab more land off the people who could n't keep up their taxes . Apparently , you were . " " You 're quite welcome to think anything you like about my motives . That wo n't alter the fact that I did buy the land . " " My prior purchase of it and the record , showing that no taxes on it were ever delinquent , alters the fact , though . " " Where is the record of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What about the second one  --  if there was a second one ? " " Before Valois got around to recording it , or having his attorney do it for him , the war broke out . Young Dupre was on Colonel Billy Dufour 's staff in a regiment of immunes and they were among the first to be sent to Cuba . The boy 's father was n't thinking about getting an unimportant scrap of paper recorded  --  unimportant to him anyway .  | And the attorney who would ordinarily have handled such matters for him was his son  --  the son who was in Cuba . So the matter was neglected . Then , by the time the war was over both he and I had forgotten about recording the transfer , although young Valois had drawn up a regular act of sale , when the deal was consummated , with all the whereases and the business about one dollar and other good and valuable considerations , so the mistaken entry on the assessor 's books never did get corrected . What 's more , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably never would have been corrected , till either old Valois or I died . But it does n't really signify . " " Well , something 'd better signify , or I 'll . . . . " Without haste , Clyde rose . " Or you 'll what ? " he inquired casually . Then he stood , waiting for a reply , with the thumb and forefinger of each hand hooked into the pockets of his gray moleskin vest . " Go ahead , Bushrod . Finish what you were saying . You 'll do what ? " " A man has his rights , " Bushrod insisted sullenly . " And do n't stand there like an old fool . You never saw the day you could scare me , not even when I was a child . And now .... " " Now you 're a bold hero and I 'm just a decrepit old man ? " Clyde chuckled in such genuine amusement that Bushrod looked up in equally genuine surprise . " Certainly I 'm no bull of the woods . I never was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his son Nappy , who is n't , and who can take some of the bend out of a horseshoe with his bare hands , are still up . They would n't like it if anybody got to worrying their white folks too much . Sounds like storybook stuff , does n't it ? But it 's real . So is what I told you about your deed to any part of Cindy Lou not being worth the match you 'd strike to set fire to the paper it 's written on . As for me , decrepit or not , I propose to keep my health and strength till Larry 's old enough to fend for himself . . . no ! " ? he interrupted himself as Bushrod seemed about to speak ? " you abide where you are and let me do the talking for now . " You renounced all claim , right or interest to Cindy Lou when I told your grandmother Larry wanted and needed no part of the Virginia properties . But you tried to buy your way in through the hack door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your title to the lioisblanc tract had been valid , you 'd have lost it to me at poker tonight , by trying to run in some nursery tricks that would n't have fooled a bunch of schoolteachers playing Authors : In other words , you forfeited any right to any share or part of Cindy Lou I do n't know how many times over . " " Your sermons do n't interest me any more than your real estate dealings , " Bushrod said , rising . " If you must talk , talk to the walls . I 'm going to bed . As to who has title to the Boisblanc land , I 'll look into the records before I tell you what I 'll do in the matter . " " You 'll find it would pay you better to listen to me , " Clyde went on .  | Bushrod , who had already started toward the door , half turned and waited . But his bearing showed plainly that he was merely pausing , momentarily , between one step and the next . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to consideration , " Clyde continued evenly , " but I 've always been willing to pay for what I want . And what I want is that Larry should be left alone by the likes of you . So I 'll do this : as long as you stay away from Cindy Lou , I 'll pay you an allowance that will keep you from any need to panhandle or engage in any of the other ways you 've used in making ends meet . It wo n't be enough to fit you out with a private apartment at the Gibson House or the Waldorf . . . but perhaps you can sweet-talk or blackguard Mabel into giving you a remittance to stay away from Amalfi , except when she wants you to make an appearance there . With two remittances , you 'll be secure against everything but your own folly . . . and before you go , by way of lagniappe , here 's something that 's about your speed . Matter of fact , you suggested it . " Withdrawing right thumb and forefinger from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white sugar-tit onto the brightly lit table . Outside in the night-cloaked garden , one of the peacocks again burst into a raucous screech . Furiously , Bushrod flung the sugar-tit into the fire and stormed from the room . Much later , Clyde was aroused once more from the light slumber of old age by the peacocks ' clamorous discord . He realized that some sort of commotion was afoot on the grounds ; but his energy had been deeply drained by the events of the day and he did not rise to investigate . Not until he came downstairs the following morning , after noting that Bushrod 's room , deserted , had been left in chaotic disorder , did he learn from Zack that all the peacocks had been found dead in the garden , where someone had wrung their jewel-sheathed necks during the night . It was only after he had superintended their burial , and the rage which surged through him mingled with the consciousness that another link with the happy past was gone , that he remembered to speak to Zack about the anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and , subconsciously , he might have used this as an excuse for the delay : he had not been willing to believe that anything was amiss aboard the Lucy Batchelor , which was a still more important link with the past , and Zack had not noticed the change in her . But when they went out to her together , they both realized that there must be a slow leak somewhere , that she was gradually settling . Before expert help could locate the cause of the trouble , she had sunk without a trace .  | DID not surprise Clyde to find Larry playing with his blocks ; this was one of the little boy 's favorite pastimes . Neither did it surprise the man to find that Larry had brought the blocks to the office , instead playing with them in the nursery or in the library , as he had done eretofore . Clyde had always encouraged Larry to stay with him and there was no reason why the child should have thought he would not be fully as welcome to bring his playthings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box in which the blocks were kept was rather heavy ; it was about a foot square and it was made of wood , ornamented with etched Oriental figures framed in bands of dark green . Originally , it had contained tea . Clyde could remember when Lucy bought their tea in large wooden boxes like that , shipped direct from China . They had used a great deal of tea in those days  --  a long , long time ago .... That was not the point , of course . The point was that Larry , though he was large and strong for his age , could not possibly have carried that big box from the nursery  --  or even from the library  --  down the steep stairs to the office . He must have asked Tudie or Nappy to do this for him , and he must have had some special reason for it . Without impatience , but with considerable interest , Clyde waited to find out what this was . The blocks had belonged to Cary and , as she also had been a very sturdy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Larry . In the beginning they had been bright blue and bright red , in equal quantities , and the letters on them had all been bright black . Now the blue and red surfaces were streaked and faded and the bold lettering was faint at best , even where it had not been almost obliterated . The sharp corners of the blocks had either been unevenly chipped off or rubbed to roundness , and many of them were faded or cracked . But Larry had always played with them quite contentedly , ever since he had been old enough to play with blocks at all , and it had never occurred to Clyde before that perhaps he ought to get new ones  --  stone blocks , for instance , with which Larry could build houses and churches , instead of just making piles and rows . However , it occurred to him now . " I reckon that maybe we ought to be thinking about getting you some new blocks , one of these days , " he remarked . " Eh , Larry ? " Without answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy putting some of the blocks in two short rows near his grandfather 's desk . He turned them this way and that and arranged them with  |  great care . When he finally looked up , Clyde saw that his cheeks were flushed and his eyes shining . " These are alphabet blocks ! " he said . " You did n't tell me so , but Aunt Amy did . " His tone was not reproving . His adored grandfather could do no wrong in his eyes , and consequently could commit no sins of either commission or omission . Nevertheless , Clyde instantly accused himself of negligence and started to say he was sorry Aunt Amy had got ahead of him , that he should have realized Larry was old enough now to know about alphabets and not to think of blocks merely as playthings . But Larry went on so fast that Clyde had no chance to get very far . " She was surprised because you had n't taught me my letters , " Larry was saying excitedly . " So she taught them to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? C  --  D ? E  --  F. . . . " Without a mistake he chanted through the alphabet to the end . " She taught me something else , too , " he concluded in triumph . " So that I could surprise you . Look at those blocks I fixed ! " Clyde glanced down . His eyesight was not keen any more and besides , his vision seemed to be somewhat blurred at the moment . But as he focused his gaze on the blocks in front of him , he saw that they had been so arranged that the letters in one row would spell LARRY and that those in the other row would spell DADDY . Larry had always called him Daddy and not Grandfather or any abbreviation of this . And now he knew how to spell that and his name ... . " Well ! " Clyde said , clearing his throat . " Well , you certainly have surprised me , Larry ! You 've given me a very fine surprise . . . . Do you know how to spell anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll show you . " Swiftly he demolished the two rows of blocks which were standing and began to arrange others . " M  --  A ? N. B  --  O ? Y. D  --  O ? G. C  --  A ? T. H-E-N . P-I-G . C-O-W . " Clyde read in swift succession . Then Larry began to fumble a little . He was trying for HOUSE and HORSE and he became slightly confused . Clyde rose from his chair and knelt down on the floor beside him . " Maybe I could help ? " he suggested a little hesitantly . " Oh , Daddy , will you ? Aunt Amy said she thought you would . She said she 'd ask you to get me a primer , too . " " Of course I 'll help . Of course I 'll get you a primer , too . It 's just that I did n't realize .... " This time he succeeded in saying what he had started to say before . Then , until suppertime , he and Larry sat on the floor together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was reading aloud to Larry from Grimm 's Fairy Tales , he stopped every now and then and asked the little boy to point out words that he knew . It was great fun for them both . The trouble was that Larry became so excited over it all he could not go to sleep . He did not sleep in the nursery  | any more , with Tudie watching over him . He slept in the youth bed which had been his mother 's and which was now drawn up closely beside his grandfather 's four-poster . Only this time , he kept sitting up in bed to make one important announcement after another . " Larry , it 's getting late . You wo n't feel like riding Tophile tomorrow morning , if you do n't quiet down now . " " Yes I will , too . I always feel like riding Tophile . You know that , Daddy . But I 've thought of another word . I could show you if I had my blocks here . " " Well , but you left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me tomorrow . " " But I can tell you now , ca n't I , Daddy ? It 's a nice word . It has four letters in it . " " All right , tell me now . But after you 've told me , I want you to turn right over and ? " " B-O-A  --  T. " Clyde did not answer . It did not matter , in the darkness , that his vision was blurred . But something seemed to have happened to his voice , too . " Do n't you think that 's a nice word , Daddy ? Are n't you pleased ? " " Yes , " Clyde said at last . " Yes , I think it 's a very nice word . Yes , I 'm very much pleased . " Larry finally went to sleep , but Clyde still lay awake beside him , i hinking hard . He had not paid much attention when Larry teased Zack , who was handy with a jackknife , to whittle little boats . He had thought the boy 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or something else , just as logically . Afterward , to be sure , he had noticed that Larry 's favorite pastime , next to riding his pony , seemed to consist in steering the little boats about in an old sugar kettle , now used only to hold rain water . But he had not regarded that as significant , either . Perhaps he should have . And of course he should have realized that a child , who could ride and swim as well as Larry could already , was old enough for book learning , too ; and yet he had not given it a thought . He was grateful to Amy , of course ; but he was chagrined that she should have had to point the way ; he was also slightly jealous because it was she who had taught Larry his letters . Probably he himself would not make much of a teacher ; but he could at least have done that much and perhaps a little more . He would look , the first thing in the morning , to see if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had a primer . Yes , he remembered now , Lucy had taught her to read out of one called by the astonishing name of Warner 's Holiday Album ; and then there had been McGufley 's First Reader  --  and Second Reader  --  and Third Reader . They were certainly around somewhere . But perhaps now  | there was something newer , something more modern . He must make inquiries . And not only of Amy . She meant well , she had done her best , better than he had done himself . But certainly someone else could do better still ... . Larry would need other things besides a primer . A slate . Slate pencils . A blackboard . Chalk . If he could learn to spell he could learn to cipher . Well now , he had said nothing about numbers . Perhaps Amy had not stolen a march on Clyde when it came to numbers . He did not believe she had , either . Most women did not seem to realize that numbers were just as important as letters . And Larry would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . He and Larry would have a good time together , over sums . Even the multiplication table .. . there must be some way of teaching a child the multiplication table so that it would not mean bewilderment and misery . He would find out . People talked about the three R 's  --  Readin ' ? ' Ritin ' ? ' Rithmetic . And ' Ritin ' , not ' Rithmetic , came next after Readin ' . Maybe . But he was not going to let any old method stand in the way of his teaching Larry to cipher  --  straight off , too . Besides , if he remembered correctly , Lucy had taught Cary to print before teaching her to write . Well , he could do that also  --  he could do both . He would get some of those ruled copybooks that had a page of letters in the front  --  capital letters and small letters , too , formed with an almost incredible degree of perfection and enclosed in a decorative scrollwork . Then he would practice secretly at copying these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His penmanship had never been bad  --  in fact , it had once been a source of considerable pride to him . Lucy had complimented him on it more than once . But he would try to improve it ... . Perhaps Larry should be taught to read and write French at the same time he was taught to read and write English . That was the way Savoie had been taught , Clyde knew ; if Savoie had lived he would have wanted his son taught in the same way . And Cary had not been much older than Larry when she had begun to study French . Lucy had not taught her that , because Lucy had insisted that the Madames of the Sacred Heart at Convent would do it so much better . But the nuns themselves complimented Lucy on her knowledge of French . Though she did not speak it as fluently as Cary quickly learned to do , she read it with ease and wrote it with grace . Even Mrs. Vincent admitted that ... . Perhaps he should write to Mrs. Vincent for suggestions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her only son 's only child and to expect that this opinion would be respected . Clyde resolved that he would write to her the next day  --  well , perhaps not the next day , because he and Larry had planned to ride out on the levee and watch Nappy catch a mess of shad sardines in the yellow  | flood that writhed seaward below the plantation at high water . But certainly very soon . However , it might be necessary to start on some sort of a program before he heard from Mrs. Vincent , for he had no assurance that she would reply promptly . With each succeeding season her letters had been farther and farther apart . Poor Lamartine still lingered on , a helpless cripple ; and two years after the birth of the heir Pierre Lamartine , whom they called Pierrot , Armande had had another child , a little girl this time , who had been named Janine . Mrs. Vincent 's outlook seemed to be bound by solicitude for her invalid husband , her pride in her daughter and her doting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned her son-in-law and occasionally Clyde wondered whether there were any special reason for this ; but he avoided giving the matter much thought . Sometimes Mrs. Vincent did refer with a certain arrogance to the reconciliation between the two branches of the De Chanet family , which Armande had effected , and spoke of the visits which Pierre 's half sister the Princesse D'Ambly and her daughters  --  Josephine , now the Baronne de Courville , and Isabelle , who had recently married Gilles de Lorne ? periodically made at Monteregard . The old marquis had died and Pierre was now at the head of the family ; his son Pierrot was still the only male descendant  --  a fact on which Mrs. Vincent commented , with little apparent regard for the disappointment this must have caused , but rather with great personal satisfaction . However , it appeared that Josephine had a darling little daughter  --  Louise  --  who was a little younger than Pierrot and a little older than Janine , and that the three children had wonderful times together . Obviously , Mrs. Vincent was interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others ; and though it pleased her to speak of her important connections with such families as the D'Amblys , the De Courvilles and the De Lornes , Clyde was sure that her enjoyment was based on a sensation of vicarious prestige rather than on any feeling of genuine affection . Nevertheless , the effect of such a milieu had been to alienate her from the one in which she had formerly lived and which she had never regarded as quite worthy of her . Larry , the little American grandson whom she had not seen since he was a baby ; Cary , his mother , who had not  --  in her estimation  --  been the social equal of her son Savoie ; and his grandparents , Lucy and Clyde Batchelor , who by no stretch of the imagination could ever have " belonged " to the Creole aristocracy , were all part of that milieu . She was only dimly aware of Larry now and she had no desire that the vague image should become more real to her . Clyde would write to her , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could tell beforehand what she would say in her tardy reply : she was sorry to have left his nice letter so long unanswered , but poor Lamartine required more and more attention ; and the children had had the mumps  --  light cases , fortunately , but one could never be too  | careful of adverse symptoms which might develop suddenly . Since their recovery the chateau had been full of company . Dorothee , as usual , had been in Paris , so it had been necessary that she herself help Armande oversee the household and entertain all these people who were coming and going . ( Here would follow a formidable list of names culled from the Almanach de Gotha . ) She was happy to say that Josephine 's husband Jehan had been able to accompany her on her latest visit , though Gilles had been prevented from bringing Isabelle because of pressing duties on his own estate , which was one of the finest in France . Louise was not nearly as pretty as Janine , but she was a very cheerful child , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of companionship . Oh , yes  --  about Larry ! Well , of course Savoie had always had a tutor . Probably that would be the best solution for Larry , too  --  at least , if Clyde could find a suitable young man of exemplary habits who was also an accomplished classical scholar . But Mrs. Vincent had an idea that tutors , like servants , were not what they used to be ... . Lying thoughtfully awake in the darkness , Clyde dismissed the idea of a tutor then and there . When the time came , he would write to Mrs. Vincent and tell her that her surmise had been correct , that , unfortunately , he had not been able to find a suitable young man of exemplary habits , who was also an accomplished classical scholar ; it would not hurt his conscience to omit mention of the fact that he had not searched for any such paragon . However , the next evening , after he and Larry had returned from their swim in the old barrow pit on the batture , and Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time , but drowsy from fresh air and exercise  --  Clyde rode up the river road to confer quietly with Mrs. Surget . She had been hoping he would come , she told him ; she had not liked to hurry him , to seem in any way to interfere , but it was really high time . . . . Well , what specifically would she recommend ? . . . Would he consider Jefferson College ? she wanted to know . Generally boys were not received there until the age of ten or twelve , but occasionally exceptions were made for special cases . It was out of the question , Clyde answered , with more heat than he intended . He could not take Larry back and forth from Convent every day , or spare one of the hands to do so . That would mean four trips ; besides , it was a long ride , too long for a little boy . As far as that went , Mrs. Surget replied quietly , Larry would not go back and forth every day ; he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . All right , she might have known in advance what his answer would be to that , Clyde responded , still more heatedly ; he had not the slightest idea of permitting Larry to be separated from him . He would teach the child himself , as well as he could . Of course French would have to wait . . . . Mrs. Surget forbore to say she had known that was what he wanted to do , all along , that his call had been simply a gesture of courtesy .  | Nevertheless , she smiled to herself when he had gone . Now that he had been driven to it , Clyde would probably make a very good teacher . However , she had done the driving  --  quietly , secretly even , but nonetheless skillfully . That was the way women often had to work . Results proved that it was not a bad way . The lessons were a success from the beginning . Clyde emptied a ground floor chamber of its furniture and fitted it up as a schoolroom . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use by his business associates , and had always been kept in readiness for their reception . Now that he no longer had such visitors or , indeed , visitors of any kind , except at very rare intervals , it had outlasted its original purpose and it should have another . The lessons provided this . Larry was delighted with his primer , his slate , his copybook , his wellfilled pencil box , his varicolored chalk ; he was even more pleased with the little desk , placed beside his grandfather 's large one . Its opening was on the top , and there was room inside for all his new treasures , except the blackboard ; moreover , there was a row of little drawers down one side , in which future treasures could be stored . This desk had been bought on purpose for him ; it had not belonged to someone else first , like all the rest of the furniture in the house . It was his very own . They did not have lessons at regular hours , but fitted them , more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plantations left free . Larry nearly always accompanied his grandfather in riding the crops and Clyde marveled at the boy 's natural aptitude for the saddle . Apparently , it never occurred to him to remain on the headlands and trot sedately over bridges ; if something along one of the drainage banks caught his eye , he kneed Tophile , his small plantation pony , out into the field and sent him briskly over the ditches in beautifully timed jumps . He had outgrown the fat little Shetland on which he had learned to ride , and Clyde had purchased Tophile for him in Tennessee . From the beginning , there had been an extraordinary degree of understanding and attraction between horse and rider . Almost instinctively , Tophile seemed to divine what Larry required of him ; and he fulfilled these requirements with the same zest that Larry himself showed in revealing them . No day was long enough to provide all the hours which the boy wanted to spend in riding , and it did not occur to him that lessons should interfere with a pursuit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he should make an issue of the matter . But though the lessons were so irregular , there were just as many of them  --  if not more  --  than there would have been if Larry had been going to school . Saturday was not automatically a holiday merely because it was a Saturday ; in fact , if there were rain , Clyde and Larry sometimes spent the entire day in the schoolroom and more than made
