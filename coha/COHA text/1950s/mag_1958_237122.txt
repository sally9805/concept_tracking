The owl-eyed little man in the blue suit and glossy silk tie stood at the rostrum in Philadelphia 's Municipal Auditorium and squinted misty-eyed down at the placards waving back and forth . They all trumpeted the same theme : " Jimmy , Do n't Leave Us " ; " Jimmy , We Need You ! " For two minutes James Caesar Petrillo , 66 , blew his nose into the first of two handkerchiefs , mopped his eyes with the other . Finally , the words came in a convulsive croak : " Little Caesar is bowing out . Goodbye , Little Caesar ! " <P> To take Petrillo 's place as president of the American Federation of Musicians , the assembled delegates elected Little Caesar 's own nominee , Herman David Kenin , 56 , the union 's West Coast representative . A onetime fiddler and bandleader , New Jersey-born Kenin practiced law in Portland , Ore . and dabbled in union politics for 22 years , gave up his law practice in 1943 , when he became a member of the A.F.M. 's executive board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overpadded whoop-and-holler style as the violin section from the brasses . The Petrillo breed , lamented Jimmy last week , is extinct : " I used to be able to say to the bosses , ' Go to hell , ' and they went to hell . Now you tell them ' Go to hell , ' and they tell you back , ' You go to hell . ' What the unions need these days is smooth guys . " Responded Smooth Guy Kenin : " I can not hope to fill the shoes of our beloved Jimmy-the greatest labor leader of our times . "
