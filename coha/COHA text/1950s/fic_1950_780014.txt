 | " You were saying that you would n't accept a challenge , " Lance said . " Oh , yes . I would n't accept any challenge , Lance  --  as a matter of principle . To me , dueling is an outmoded barbarism that proves nothing except perhaps that one man can shoot straighter than another . The man less given to nervousness , whose hand does n't shake , always wins . But it has n't the slightest connection with innocence or guilt . How many cuckolded husbands have n't you seen shot dead by their spouse 's paramours , who then pro ceeded to crowd the mourners by repeating the offense ? " " You 've got a point there , " Lance admitted , " still ... " Still , nothing . I especially would n't accept one from you because you happen to be the best friend I have in this world . I do n't particularly relish the thought of dying . Unsatisfactory as my life is at the moment , the chance exists that things might better themselves . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . I relish that even less . All the rest of my life guilt would haunt me  --  that I was fool enough , and coward enough , to bow to an archaic and obscene custom that has no valid place in modem life . I 'm a civilized man , Lance . I do n't fight duels . I would n't exchange shots or cross blades with a man who has always befriended me , who has gone out of his way to aid me  --  who has been endlessly kind . Not even if these malicious waggers of eternally forked tongues were telling the truth ? which they are n't . At the risk of being redundant , I 'll say it again : They 're lying , Lance . What I want to know is  --  why ? " Wallace came in with the tray , and bowed before Lance . Lance took the decanter and poured bourbon for both of them . " You sound almost convincing , Ross , " he said tiredly . " Go on  --  I 'd much rather be convinced than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant all round . " " All right , " Ross said , " though even having to vindicate myself is a kind of insult under the code you subscribe to  --  but let that pass . . . . It so happens that I left Natchez a day or two after you did , and that you were already here when I returned . I spent the entire time at the Linton Plantation , The Pines , on the Isle of Hope in Georgia , with the exception of a few days in New Orleans . If you want confirmation you can write Harry Linton  --  the  | owner . Wait  --  even that is n't necessary . I have a letter from Miss Catherine Linton , the owner 's sister , which mentions my visit . " He walked over to his secretary and took Cathy 's letter out , and gave it to Lance . Lance glanced at the envelope then passed it back , unopened . " No , " he said ; " I know the truth when I hear it . My humble apologies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lance stared at him thoughtfully , then asked the question Ross had dreaded . " What , " he drawled , " about your brother , Tom ? It occurs to me now that all they said was Pary  --  not which Pary . " " Tom , " Ross said easily , " was also away  --  on his honeymoon , for at least part of the time . After that , I do n't know . But it does n't appear to me to be likely that a man so recently wed would have developed a roving eye so soon . " " That 's true , " Lance sighed . " I guess I 've made an ass of myself . I swore I would n't listen to talk , but I get so tired , sometimes . My brain gets tired .... " " Why , " Ross said gruffly , " do n't you straighten Morgan out , Lance ? " Lance looked at him . " You think I have n't tried ? Every time I take her to task , she resorts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I 'm afraid my temper might snap , and I 'd kill her . Or she flies into rages that might be marvelously effective histrionics  --  or they might be actual insanity . I do n't know which . If I knew , I could deal with them ; either way I could deal with them . But I just do n't know .... " His voice trailed off into silence . Looking at him , Ross was filled with pity . Lance Brittany , he knew , could not be over fifty-one years old . At the moment he looked sixty , his dark , handsome face lined and sad . His hair had whitened so much in the single year that Ross had known him that the blackness had well-nigh disappeared from it . My God ! Ross thought , she 's killing him . . . she 's slowly worrying him to death ... . " Why do n't you get rid of her , " he said harshly ; " get an annulment  --  or a divorce ? " Lance raised his splendid , massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said simply . " I see . Sorry , Lance . I was way out of line that time . It 's just that I hate to see you so troubled , " " Thanks , " Lance whispered , and stared off into space , holding the bourbon untouched in his hands . " It 's gotten to be damned lonely , Ross , " he said quietly . " We give parties now  --  and nobody comes . They do n't say Mrs. Brittany any more , now . It 's ' that Brittany woman . ' You named our house better than you knew , Finiterre  --  land 's end . The end of the world .... " Ross got up and put a hand on Lance 's shoulder . " Buck up , old fellow , " he said ; " it 'll work out all right . A little more time and . . . Lance stood up and drained the glass . " No , " he said ; " it wo n't work out , Ross . Not ever . " Then he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intrusion , " he said grimly . " So long , Ross . " " So long , " Ross echoed , and stood there watching him as he went down the stairs .  | Chapter 11 Ross HAD slept late , a thing he rarely did , and which ordinarily would not have mattered at all . But on this July second of 1851 , it had certain consequences . He was made aware of that at once . For , when he opened his eyes , he stared up into the face of Morgan Brittany . He sat up in bed , staring at her . He rubbed his eyes and looked again , but Morgan was still there . " What the devil are you doing here ? " he said brusquely . Morgan laughed . The sound of her laughter made him cold all over , despite the July heat . It was clear and limpid as spring water . Morgan , he thought miserably , achieves her most diabolical effects through contrast  --  a face as innocent as a Vestal 's ; a laugh like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , " she said . " And at a most respectable hour at that . It 's after eleven . Come on , you lazybones ? get up ! " " No , " Ross said . " Then I 'll join you , " Morgan laughed . " You look so cosy there , and I 'm tired . Move over , wo n't you ? " " No , " Ross groaned ; " I 'll get up . But go in the sitting room , wo n't you  --  and give me half a chance ? " " No , " Morgan teased . " That nightshirt is such an adorable shade , and anyhow you have nice legs . I 've seen them , you know ; but only , I 'm sorry to say inside that tight-fitting evening habit of yours . Come on , get up . " " Who let you in ? " Ross demanded .  | " Wallace . He could n't help it , poor fellow . I threatened ur take my crop to him . " " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take mine to him for doing it ! " Morgan threw back her head and laughed again . " Poor Wallace ! He really is caught between two fires , is n't he ? " " Will you go in the next room ? " Ross said . " No . You 're too modest . You should n't be . You 're a very hand . some man , and such girlish sentiments do n't become you . " " Morgan , for the love of God ! " " No . " Ross stared at her . You lovely little witch , he thought . By now , I could be lying on the sandbar across the river with a bullet through my guts because of you , if I had n't had sense enough to keep my temper . " Where , " he asked quietly , " is Lance right now ? " " Over in Louisiana  --  as usual . I told you , darling , he trusts me . " " He does n't , " Ross said flatly . " He was here not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some damned , gossiping fool got me confused with Tom . " 1 Morgan clapped her hands together , gleefully like a child . " How thrilling ! " she laughed . " I would have liked to have seen that  --  two angry brutes exchanging shots over me ! " " You disgust me , " Ross said coldly . " You make me sick to the pit of my stomach . " " Do I , darling ? " Morgan whispered , and got up from her chair . The old light was back in her eyes . Jesus God ! Ross thought , will I never be free of her ? She started toward his bed , but at that moment Wallace pushed his head into the room . " Marse Ross , Marse Ross , " he quavered , " Missy Conchita 's downstairs ! " All the color drained out of Ross 's face . Morgan could n't have done better if she had planned it . Conchita had the fiery temper of her Latin forebears , and a situation like this was impervious to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could give Conchita for Morgan 's presence , the truth was the most unbelievable .  | " Send her up , Wallace ! " Morgan laughed . " We 'll be so glad to see her  --  wo n't we , dear ? " " Damn you ! " Ross said fiercely ; " damn you to hell and back again ! " " Now , dearest , do n't be cross . I 'm going to surprise you . I 'm going to be self-sacrificing and gallant . I 'm going out in the kitchen and down the back stairs  --  she 'll never know I was here . Now , are n't I sweet ? " " Well , I 'll be damned ! " Ross said helplessly . But Morgan was as good as her word . An instant before Conchita stepped into the room , the door closed quietly behind her . " Ross , " Conchita whispered , " my Ross ? " and her words choked off . Ross could see the big tears in her eyes . She had been crying a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen almost shut . He was out of bed in an instant and gathered her into his arms . " Conchita mia , " he said , " what 's wrong ? Did your father ... ? " " Oh yes ! " she wept ; " my father  --  my father . . . . Oh , little father mine , how could you ? " " How could he what ? " Ross said gruffly ; " did he beat you ? " " Oh , no ! My father was the soul of kindness . What he did was far worse ! He  --  he left me , my Ross .... " " Left you ? But how  --  why ? " " There came a week ago a letter from Cuba , from the hand , I believe , of Joaquin de Aguero , my father 's friend . Aguero plans the revolt upon which Lopez counts so heavily .... " " So there will be a revolt ? " Ross asked incredulously . " Oh , yes ! A terrible revolt  --  many will die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's aid . I do not know  --  these things were kept from me . But there was much argument , loud and fierce , between Father and Jose . Jose kept telling Father that he was being a fool , and Father kept saying , ' I must go ! I must ! ' " " He went back to Cuba  --  old and crippled as he is ? " " Old and crippled as he is , " Conchita said quietly ; " my father is of the stuff of heroes . And now he will die  --  unless ... " " Unless what ? " Ross asked . " Someone goes to save him , " Conchita said . " You mean , " Ross said harshly , " that I should join this new expedition of Lopez ' ? "  | " Yes , " Conchita said . " But , Conchita , " Ross protested , " this thing is foredoomed to failure , and you know it . What would it serve if your father and I both died ? Then you would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her green eyes very clear . " Are you afraid , my Ross ? " she murmured . " Yes , " Ross said frankly , " I am . This of dying is never a very pleasant thing ; and now it is doubly unpleasant because it in ? volves losing you . " " Letting my father die , " Conchita said quietly , " also involver losing me , my Ross . " Ross stared at her . " I see , " he said at last . " In that case , 1 have no choice . " " You 'll go ! " Conchita breathed ; " oh my darling , I knew that you would ! It is not a thing of dying , my own , but of living  --  for with such a man as Don Joaquin to lead them , the people will rise ; and when they do , their wrath will be terrible . They have so much to avenge  --  so many wrongs , so terribly many cruel . ties .... " " Yes , " Ross said ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a new grave in Cuba , and nothing will be gained thereby . Now I am looking at you for the last time , you who are all my heart and my life and my hope of hereafter . You speak of cruelties , but this is the cruelest of all , that you send me out to my ' death , knowing I can not refuse you ... . " Ross ! " the voice called from the kitchen . " Darling  --  where are the towels ? " He felt Conchita stiffen in his arms . " That perfume ! " she whispered ; " that scent I smelled when I came into the room ! Her ! Oh , Ross ! " Then Morgan was coming through the door , clad in Ross 's green silk robe , and under that robe was only Morgan . She had tied it carelessly , so that the long sweep of her thigh showed each time she moved , and her black hair , under the turban she had made of the towel , dripped water . Conchita stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The minute my back was turned . Oh , darling , how could you ! " Conchita backed away from . him , her eyes blazing .  | " Thou ! " she whispered . " Puta y reina de las putas ! " She moved backward across the room until she came to Ross 's little secretary . She put her hand back behind her and her fingers groped , closing finally over the paper knife . " Know you , " she whispered , " that you have earned your death ! " Then she sprang forward all at once , like a tigress . Ross stepped between them , and his fingers closed ovet Cont hita 's wrist . He twisted cruelly and the knife clattered to the floor . Conchita turned her face toward his , and the tears misted her eyes . " Yes , yes ! " she whispered , " you would save her ! That follows , does it not ? She also shares your bed . Then , oh faithless one , farewell ! You may forget this of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not have his life at the hands of such a one as you ! " She jerked herself free of his grip in one convulsive motion , and ran toward the door . But in it , she turned , just for a moment . " Adios , my Ross , " she whispered ; " Know thou that I have loved thee  --  much ! " Then her high heels made a staccato clatter , going down the stairs . Ross turned toward Morgan and his face was terrible . " Get out , " he said . " Now , Ross , " Morgan said ; " do n't be unnecessarily stupid . I had to save you from that . From what I could gather between the times you two were switching back and forth from English to Spanish , she was sending you off on that asinine Lopez expe-dition ? " " I said , get out . " His voice was flat , calm , perfectly controlled ; but Morgan , whose greatest talent was her ability to read men , knew what a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd kill mel He really would ! " Like this ? " she whispered . " No , " Ross said , coldly , " go dress yourself . Then go . " The minute she had left the room he flew into his clothes . If I hurry , he thought , there 'll be time ! The boat does not leave for twenty minutes yet  --  so there 'll be time ! Five minutes later , he was pounding down the bluff toward the landing before which the steamboat waited . He saw Con-  | chita standing on the deck and started up the plank toward he ! . But Conchita turned to the young officer at her side . " That man , " she said , " is pursuing me . Can not a lady be pro . tected from unwelcome attentions in your country , Senor ? " " You bet she cant " the officer said , and blew a little whistle . Two minutes later , Ross Pary was borne backward down the plank under a rush of four sailors . Be it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross , despite his height was slender ; and , although he possessed considerable wiry strength , he was no match for four muscular sailors . He picked himself gingerly out of the dirt , and dusted off his clothing , staring at the steamboat as it moved majestically out into the channel . Then , very slowly , he turned back to where Nancy waited , her reins trailing down over her well-shaped head , into the dust that was now the substance of his hopes . When by the latter part of the month of July , 1851 , no letter had come from Conchita , Ross Pary decided to go to New Orleans . He arrived in that city on the afternoon of July twentythird , and debarked at the foot of Lafayette Street ; both of which circumstances proved unfortunate , for the day was the one set for the great mass meeting in support of the second Lopez expedition to free Cuba ; and his route lay through Lafayette Square where it was being held . As a result , Ross found himself stopped by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city . Swearing fiercely under his breath , Ross waited . Lopez addressed the crowd , assuring them that this time his plans could not fail . To Ross 's astonishment every one there appeared to believe him . Ross looked at his watch . Goddammit to hell , would they never get done with their speechmaking ? Two hours later he was still there . On the other side of the crowd , separated from Ross by some thousands of people , Conchita Izquierdo also watched and listened . But she could n't stay . The talk of Cuba only increased the gnawing fear she had for her father 's safety , so , hours before the meeting was over , she left it and went back home , which she  | could easily do , for being on the side of the square that faced the city , her route was not blocked . When she got back to her house , she found Jose Mendez waiting for her and with him was a man , a young Cuban who looked o tired and ill that for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jose , " she said ; " we must feed him and give him wine . You have come from Cuba , Senor ? But that I have no heed to ask ; I can see that you have . Come in . " The two men followed her up the stairs . She moved with nervous speed through the rooms calling out to the servants , ordering food and wine ; then she turned back to the stranger . " Your name , Senor ? " she asked . " Alvarez , Miguel Alvarez , at your orders , Senorita . I  --  I have news for you . " Conchita stared at him ; then she leaned forward , placing both her hands upon the table to steady herself . " My father , " she whispered ; " is he  --  is he ? " " That I can not say , Senorita , " Miguel murmured ; " I know only that when I left Nuevitas , he was in grave danger of being captured  --  or killed .... " " I see , " Conchita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed forward . " The news of glorious victories , " Jose burst out passionately , " was spread abroad by Captain-General de la Concha 's spies ? and Lopez believes them . Holy Virgin ! " " Tell me about my father , " Conchita said . " Of this I have much sorrow , " Miguel began . " Tell me ! " Conchita spat . " I have little to tell you . The few patriots that answered Don Joaquin de Aguero 's call to arms were met everywhere by defeat , everywhere by death . When they sent me away to warn General Lopez here , the last of our forces were fighting in Nuevitas , against Spanish armies equipped with artillery . I saw your father just before I left , Senorita . He was sitting in a wheelchair in the street , with a rifle in his hands and two revolvers in his lap . He was killing Spaniards with great neatness and accuracy . That 's all I know , Dona Conchita ... . " I see , " Conchita gasped . Then : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength . "  | Jose stared at her . " They will not let him near Lopez ! " he said . " They swear he is a spy  --  Miguelito , here  --  the only man in New Orleans who knows the truth ! " " Jose ? " Conchita said . " Yes , Conchita ? " " When sails the mail steamer for Havana ? " " No , Conchita ! No ! " " I asked you a question , Jose . " " Two hours from now . But you can not go , Conchita ! You are a woman , and the things that they do to women ... " " I know . You will purchase the ticket for me , Jose ? " " No ! God and His Sacred Mother , no ! " " Then I will purchase it myself . " " I will go for you , " Jose said ; " this I can not permit .... " " It lies not in your power to permit or forbid , amigo mio . And you will not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , whom I love , proved faithless , I care not if I live or die . Perhaps I can save my little father . If not , I shall avenge him . " " This is madness of a most formidable quality , and I will not have it ! " Jose roared ; " even if I have to bind you with ropes , I will not have it ! " " You can not prevent me , " Conchita said , standing up . " I go , my friends . Do not seek after me . I shall not return to this house . " Jose put his left hand upon the table , and lurched across it , seizing her arm in his right hand . Conchita whirled , and her hand came down upon the table and closed over the big fork that anchors the meat for the carving . She struck down hard and all at once so that the two tines went through his left hand , pinning it to the table . Jose turned her loose and hung there staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal that stood up from his hand . " Mother of God ! " Miguel groaned . " I have much sorrow for this , Jose , " Conchita said . " And now ? I go . " So it was , that when Ross Pary finally reached the house late that evening , he found the serving maid in tears . " M'amzelle Conchita ai n't here no more , her ! " the black girl  | sobbed ; " She gone back to Cuba . And they going to kill her there ! I just knows they is  --  just like they done killed her papa , them ! Le Bon Dieu have mercy , M'sieu Ross  --  this here family is plumb ruined ! " Ross did not even answer her . He turned then , and started running  --  back toward Gravier Street , where Banks Arcade was , where a recruiting desk waited , and an expedition mustered its strength to set sail for the island of Cuba .  | Chapter 12 Ross PARY lay in the bamboo thicket about twelve miles from Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tattered mass of rags that was all that was left of his shirt and scratched tiredly . There was n't , he reckoned , one square inch of his hide that the insects of Cuba had n't been able to reach . They had even penetrated his curly blond beard ; but even to scratch them , now , required too much effort . He saw Narciso Lopez speaking to one of the men . The man nodded grimly and moved off . After a time he came back , leading General Lopez ' horse . He led it up to the fire and took off its saddle ; then , holding the bridle , he shot it . The other men , one hundred and forty of them  --  all that were now left of the more than four hundred and fifty that had landed at Morillo on August eleventh , got up slowly , looking like a crew of dirty , ragged scarecrows , and moved over to where the animal lay . They went to work upon it with their knives , cutting off pieces of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had singed the meat a little , they drew it out and ate it . Ross did n't eat . He could n't . Lopez ' horse had been a noble beast . He had ridden it himself on more than one occasion . To devour him now was almost like making a meal of Nancy , his own mare . Ross looked toward Lopez and saw that he was crying . There was enough to weep over . They had landed at Morillo and found the town deserted . They had fought at Las Pozas and won  --  but left Colonel Dorman , and Colonel Pragay , and Captain Ile de  | Fousse Overto dead upon the ground with fifty of their men , and a hundred more wounded . Since they could not replace their losses , this first victory of theirs had finished them . They had been separated from Colonel Crittenden 's forces , and no man here knew if they 'd ever see them alive again . Captain Kelly had brought back forty men whom Crittenden had left behind to guard his stores as he pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , too , but they had escaped through the manigua , that spiny , subtropical Cuban jungle that ripped a man 's flesh to pieces with thorns , and rejoined Ldpez ' forces . They had fought again at Las Frices , and lost seventy more killed , and all their arms except sixty-nine muskets . Sixty-nine muskets for one hundred and forty men . And some time during those two brief weeks , the Ross Par ) who had been , died , and a new man was born out of the old . It started at Las Pozas , Ross thought , when he had had to climb out of the stream in which he had been bathing and fight the Spaniards with nothing but a revolver , lying naked in the dirt between two houses . Then he had n't had time to be afraid , and afterwards it came to him that killing people who are bent upon killing you was a damnably easy thing to get used to . And the second thing was the time that they had made a great circle after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come back to the place where they had left their wounded and the stragglers . They found them after the Spaniards had got through with them , spread-eagled upright between posts driven into the ground . The bones of their ribcages showed dull white where the skin of their backs had been . It had been taken off , inch by inch with a nine foot loaded lash  --  while they were yet alive , for the blood and pieces of flesh were spattered around them in a semicircle ; and then the Spaniards had ripped open their bellies with their bayonets , so that the pink coils of their intestines trailed down into the dirt . And on the crosspieces and all around them in a circle the vultures perched , flapping their heavy wings and tearing at the bodies with their beaks . And when the wind shifted , there was the smell . Ross had vomited up the good breakfast the hacendado had given him , but afterwards something had gone from him , too  | something like gentleness , like compassion  --  and what had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core of his heart . Yesterday , at Las Frices , he had discovered what it was like , his new thing that he had ; he had made the acquaintance of the man he had become , He and the Metcalfes had stood under the mango trees and fired upon the charging Spaniards until finally t hey had no more ammunition . One of the Spaniards aimed a ( bayonet at Ross 's belly , and Ross had turned aside like a bullfighter and brought the barrel of the Colt down across the man 's arm , breaking it , and then he hit him across the head , and the Spaniard fell between him and the Metcalfes and all three of them smashed at his head with their gun butts until it did n't look like a head any more ; then Henry Metcalfe spat on him . A month before , they had been civilized men . And of Conchita Izquierdo  --  nothing  --  no word . The Spaniards had given him no time to search for her ; and the people he had managed to ask stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lopez got up now and raised his arms . " Caballeros ! " he said , " I want to ask your pardon  --  while we all are still alive . " Ross stared at him . Humility was not a trait that he had associated with Narciso Lopez . " I let my optimism . blind me , " Lopez went on . " From talking to that good black , Pedro , who brought us back together , I 've learned the magnitude of my errors . It seems that de la Concha had a group of fifty well trained agents in New Orleans , and fifteen in New York . Every report of victory that we received ? every call for aid , came directly from his office . He wanted us to leave the States before General Gonzales and Governor Quitman were ready . He succeeded brilliantly  --  thanks to my stupidity . We came into Cuba expecting to be met by patriot armies . But those armies have been crushed and scattered , their leaders executed . Our mission has become hopeless . Even the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are Yankee Imperialistic pirates .... " He bowed his massive head , his broad shoulders shaking . " Upon my head , " he whispered , " lies the guilt of all those who have died , and all those who will die  --  God forgive me ! "  | He stood still until he had mastered himself , then he faced them again . " Now , " he said , " we must try to reach the plain of San Cristobal , and from there . , . " But a snarling mutter ran from man to man and cut him off . " Nol " they growled ; " no gawddarnned more marching . We 've had a bellyfull . It 's safer here  --  out there , they 'll shoot us down like rats ! " Lopez looked at them . " Caballeros , " he said ; " you have much right . I weep with you . You have borne yourselves like men and heroes , and now I can not find it in my heart to blame you . Rest here , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surrender myself , on condition that you be spared . Adios , mis ninos ! God be with you ! " He started off , but Ross Pary got up then and Henry Metcalfe got up with him and the two of them seized Lopez ' arms . " No , " Ross said ; " not for us . " He turned toward the men to address them , but when he looked into their faces he saw that it was not necessary . They were all filled with shame , and some of them were crying . " Hell , " one Kentuckian growled , " who wants to die in bed , anyhow ? We 're with you , General . " The men roared a cheer , and they charged out of the wood and down into the plain where five hundred Spanish troops waited . They were like madmen , like demons  --  one hundred forty men without food and water , almost out of ammunition , with but sixty-nine muskets among them and no bayonets , charging an army . The Spaniards broke under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right and left , and opening up the middle , and through it came the cavalry . Ross and the others stood their ground screaming at the horsemen , but these were picked riders from Andalusia , and they came on with carbines and pistols and sabers , and thundered over the ragged little force in a cloud of red dust and re-formed and came back again and after that there was nothing left for them to do . There were six men left alive , running for the hills : Narciso Lopez , Henry Metcalfe , George Metcalfe , Lieutenant Van Vechten , Luis de Jiga Hernandez , and Ross Pary . They made it because the cavalrymen were too busy sabering  | the wounded . They pushed on until they came to the densest bamboo thicket they could find , and hid themselves in it . Nobody said anything . They lay on the ground and looked up at the sky through the leaves . The sky was very blue and clear and it was good to look at it . It reminded them of other skies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then went diagonally across the man igua and came out on the other side , but somehow in the darkness they had gradually turned so that instead of the sea only the plain lay before them , stretching out from the foothills of the sierras down toward the Southern Sea . They stood there looking at it , and a horseman came up to them and took off his sombrero and greeted them . " I am Carlos Castenada , " he said ; " I would be honored if you would be my guests . I have no sympathy for our oppressors . Believe me , I shall hide you well . " " We have been betrayed before , Senor , " Lopez said tiredly , " by men who spoke as fair . " " Trust me , Caballero , " Castenada said . " Within a week you shall reach the shore and a boat will be waiting .... " Lopez looked at the others . They shrugged . What difference did it make now ? They followed the Senor Castenada to his hacienda , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with rich foods and wines . All of the six started to eat at once  --  all except Ross Pary . He put his head down on the table and went to sleep at once without touching anything . The servants stared at him . " Senor ? " they whispered ; " the wine  --  he is not drinking the wine ! " " Senor General , " Carlos Castenada protested ; " the young blond one should be awakened . He has need of food  --  and wine . " " Let him sleep , " Lopez murmured ; " he has more need of sleep . " Senor Castenada shrugged . " " Could he not be put to lie down ? " Lieutenant Hernandez asked . " Assuredly , " Castenada smiled . " Ramon and Rafael  --  put the young Senor Rubio to bed . " Ross did not awaken even when he was lifted in the strong  | arms of the two Negroes . They carried him into a large room , and laid him gently in one of the hammocks . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the same room and saw him sleeping there . " Poor fellow ! " George Metcalfe yawned ; " he 's completely out . " " I could use some sleep myself , " his brother muttered . They lay down , then , all of them in the hammocks . Then , after some time , Ross heard dimly the sound of voices . " Have care of the blond one , " the voices whispered ; " he did not drink the wine ! " He came awake at once , but he kept his eyes closed ; gently he felt for his revolvers ; but they were gone . Then he put his hand in his pocket , and it closed around the big pocketknife there . I t was not too bad a weapon , considering the fact that its blade was eight inches long . Apparently the servants of the Senor Judas Iscariot Castenada had not considered it worth their while , or they had overlooked it . But how the devil was he going to get it open ? He opened his left eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had ropes and they were winding them around the unconscious forms in the hammocks . " Why in hellfire do n't they wake up ? " Ross thought ; but then he knew . The wine . He alone had not drunk that wine . The others would not wake up . They could n't , Then Ramon and Rafael were coming toward him with the ropes . Ross held the knife open in his right hand . When they were close he lashed out all at once , and Rafael dropped the rope howling , and clapped his hands to a face that was slashed open from temple to the point of his chin . Ross rolled out of the hammock , and hit the floor on the side away from Ramon , landing on his hands and knees . Then he hurled himself under it and bore Ramon down ; driving the knife into his belly the moment the black hit the floor . Then he was off , running through the door ; but the moment he was outside he stopped . He had in the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of thinking he had never known existed before . It was the natural thing for him to do to take to the woods . Castenada would expect that , and would seek for him there . So  | he would n't do the natural thing . Besides , what chance had he in the manigua armed with a pocketknife ? He doubled back at once , keeping his body flattened against the houses , until he had reached one of the stables . Inside it was cool and dark and smelled of wet hay and of horses . There was also a goodly supply of implements , including a row of machetes hanging along the wall in their scabbards . He took one down and felt its edge . He could have shaved with it . Then he went back deeper in the stable , and burrowed under some hay . There was a crack in the wall on that side , through which daylight showed . He inched over to it and looked out and then he saw the soldiers . They were bearing his friends away slung under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred men in the company . There was nothing he could do . They moved off down the road and their commander came out of the house with Carlos Castenada . They walked straight toward the stable where Ross was , and a moment later he heard them enter . " " Here he is , " Castenada said pleasantly ; " the fastest horse ever foaled . I guarantee it , Cristobal , he will come in ahead next Sunday by three full lengths . " " A noble beast , " the Spanish captain said ; " but about this t rnericano who escaped . . . " " Do not preoccupy yourself , Cristobal . He made for the brush  --  armed only with a knife . I would not preoccupy myself about him . In three days he will be dead of hunger , for he had not even the benefit of my excellent food today . " " Nor of your even more excellent wine , " the captain grumbled . " Costa will be angry . " " That is your concern , Cristobal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscene swine . Him and his music ! The sexless dog fancies himself as an amateur of the arts  --  all of which he practices badly ? except , perhaps , the art of breaking a man . But I have no interest in him . Now that this of the pirates and revolutionaries has been disposed of , I am interested only in Sunday 's race . Come have another little copy of wine with me before you go . " " Gladly , " Captain Cristobal said , and they went out of the st able . Ross lay very quietly under the hay until it was night . He was  | weak and sick with hunger ; but he would n't give up . He had a score to settle first . He moved out of the stables and along the sides of the houses until he came to the casa grande . Through the window , he could see Castenada dining alone . He was being attended by a single aged Negro . Ross circled around to the front of the house and pulled the door open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked the door . Ross walked very quietly into the salon and stood just behind the slim , elegant hacendado . Then the old Negro came out of the kitchen and saw him . The old black dropped the plate he was carrying with a terrible clatter , and fled with a speed astounding in one of his years . Castenada turned in the big , high-backed chair , and his mouth came open , his jaw trembling foolishly . He put his hand down under his short Spanish waistcoat and came out with a pistol , but Ross brought the machete down sharply and the hand holding the pistol hung on to the rest of the arm by a single shred of flesh . Castenada stared at the blood pumping out from the stump of his arm , and his face grayed . " Senor , " he whispered , " Senor Arnericano , have mercy for the love of God ! " Then Ross cut him down . He bent down and took the revolver and stuffed it into his belt . Then he sat down at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The old Negro came out of the kitchen , his face ashen with fear . " Take this platter away , and bring another , " Ross told him , " and bring me more wine ! " The old Negro did so , trembling . Ross glanced down at Castenada 's body . " Drag this swine out of here , and mop the floor , " he ordered . " He disturbs my appetite . " Half an hour later , full of good food and better wine , Ross Pary rode toward the manigua on the black stallion that was to have won the Sunday race . He was dressed in new trousers and boots , and was armed with a revolver , a carbine , and a machete . He could , he reckoned , hold out for a good , long time .  | Chapter 13 THE HOME of the Gonzalez family was a pleasant place . It was on the outskirts of Havana , and was big and old-fashioned and comfortable under the shade of the ceiba trees , with the bougainvillaea bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patio and fountains , and the sound of the fountains was like laughter . But to Conchita Izquierdo , sitting there on the patio , with Maria Gonzalez , her friend , and holding the letter in her hand , there was no more laughter . " What says it  --  your letter ? " Maria asked tensely . " It says , " Conchita said quietly , " that now I am twice damned . " " Twice ? " Maria said . " This of your father 's death  --  yes ; but twice ? " " This letter , " Conchita told her , her voice flat , calm , controlled , " was written by Jose the day after I left New Orleans . In it he tells me that the man I love , he without whom I have no more life  --  came to Cuba with the expedition  --  that perhaps now he is already one of the damnificados taken by the Spaniards .... " " An Americano ? " " Si , an Americano , " Conchita breathed , " whom now I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conchita , you are mad ! " Maria said . " Even to come back to ( : uba was mad . And to seek one man , and he an Americano  --  La l.amilia Santissima ! You are mad ! " " Si . Yes , Maria mia , I am mad . " " Everyone knows the history of your father now . He is of the heroes , even of the Saints . But his daughter can not live in Cuba .  | The Spaniards will take her and ravish her first , because she is beautiful , and afterwards they will torture her to death . My Conchita , dearest Conchita , heart of my heart , you must go ! " Conchita smiled . " The mad , " she said , " have not wit enough to flee . " " No , " the deep male voice said from the doorway ; " but I have wit enough to send her away before she brings disaster upon my house ! " Conchita turned and saw Enrique Gonzalez standing there  --  a handsome mulatto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know , Senorita , " he said , " whether your father had right or wrong in his beliefs . It is sufficient that he has died fo ! them . But I do know that I do n't propose to die for harboring his daughter  --  nor to have my wife and child turned over to those beasts who walk upright in uniform . You have returned to Cuba ; and that is your affair . But the safety of my own is my affair . I can not permit you to place us in jeopardy , Senorita , for all that your father was my friend . " Conchita got up quietly , and picked up her shawl of white lace . " At your orders , Senor Gonzalez , " she said . " Oh , Papa , " Maria began . " Silence ! " Enrique said . " I have much sorrow because of this , Senorita Izquierdo  --  and also much shame . But I can not do otherwise . Maria and her mother are very dear to me . I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered ; " oh , I do ! " " Therefore I have comprehension of the love your father bore you . For his sake Senorita  --  for his sainted memory  --  leave this land ! " " I can not , " Conchita said . " I overheard my daughter say something of an Arnericano . " Doubtless this is a thing of love ? " " Yes , " Conchita said . " Enormously . " " Then have I both pain and sorrow to tell you this : the Americans have all been captured . The Senor de Rey , Brigadier of the Plaza , has been ordered to shoot them  --  today . " Conchita stood still . Maria got up from where she sat and slipped an arm about her waist ; but Conchita did not move . " Conchita ! " Maria cried ; " Conchita mia ! "  | " You understand this which I have said ? " Enrique asked gruffly . Maria could feel her body loosening . It took a long time ; but ! finally all of the stiffness went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe again . " Yes , " she said ; " I understand . " " You must go , " Enrique said heavily . " At what hour occurs the  --  the shooting ? " Conchita shuddered . " At noon . But you must not go there ! It will be a very bad thing to watch and additionally there exists the danger that you might be recognized and . , . " " What serves it now  --  this danger ? " Conchita said . " You are young , " Enrique said ; " there will be other loves . " " No , " Conchita said , " there will be no other loves , This day I shall make sure of that . " " You 'd die because of him ? " Maria asked wonderingly . " Oh , Conchita  --  no ! " " Yes , " Conchita said . " Or say rather that I would not live without him . I can not , Maria mia , " " Then he must be  --  much , " Maria said softly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell me about him , " Maria said . " He is a rubio  --  a blond , with hair like the sunlight on the playa , and eyes like the sea far out away from the shores . He is tall and thin and his face is serious . His eyes haunt you with sadness , and his voice is like music . He is very gentle and of all kindness and of a goodness so great that sometimes I have wished it were not so . I do n't think he would knowingly hurt anything that lived . He came on this expedition to seek for me because of my madness in coming here . So , Maria mia , if he dies , I have killed him . You 'd have me live on , knowing that ? " " You love him , " Enrique said , " yet you could watch him die ? " " Yes . That I am certain of his death would be a relief . And then perhaps I could even save him . I could make a diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would die ! " Maria wept . " You 'd die  --  terribly ! " " So ? " Conchita said . " Father ! " Maria cried ; " You must not let her go ! We must hide her  --  we must send her away ... .  | " Adios , " Conchita said , and slipped rapidly through the gate . It was very hot in the Plaza and there was no wind . The people stood elbow to elbow , close-packed , sweating . The light was very hard and clear , and no cloud stood in the sky . And it came to Conchita then that she had always been happiest when it rained . She had the feeling that to die at all was a hard thing but to die on a day of great beauty under a crystalline sky in the full blaze ' of a noonday sun was a harder thing ; but the bugles cried out all at once , and there was the roll of drums and she stopped thinking altogether . Conchita saw them leading them out , fifty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their faces carefully , until they had all marched past the place where she stood , and then she straightened up , for among the fifty-two men was no one who even resembled Ross Pary . Then the officer of the day read the charges against them , but Conchita did not listen , And the bugles cried once more and the drums rolled , and the sunlight pointed up the spotless uniforms . The Spaniards knew how to make a brave ceremony out of a man 's helpless dying . Conchita wandered through the streets of Havana until it was night . Then she went into a cemetery and lay down on a grave and slept . It was , considering the superstitious fears of the populace and the soldiery alike , the safest place for her to be . The next day she went into a clothing store and purchased a riding habit for a quite mythical younger brother . She bought also a revolver and ammunition for it , and a small dagger , which she wore in a sheath next to her skin . Then she walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some friends of her father 's , and there she hid in a canebrake until nightfall . After it was dark , she stripped herself and put on the riding habit , and the sombrero which she had also bought , and then she went into the stables and stole a horse , complete with saddle and bridle . ' Po have asked for it , or to have tried to buy it would have been too dangerous , She rode deep into the manigua and waited there until daylight in order to get her bearings . At daylight , she was off again , riding deep into the jungle until she came to a group of thatched bohios  --  the little houses of the poor . The people , who were all  | Negroes , came out of the houses , and stared at her , and then they were all around her , kissing her hands and crying ; for these were the blacks that her father had liberated at the cost , finally , of his life . Conchita got down from her horse and went with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rum and water , and sat around her on the floor and watched her while she ate . She sat back after a time , sighing . " The strangers who came to set Cuba free , " she asked ; " have y ou heard anything of them ? " A tall black named Pedro stood up . " I guided them to safety near Las Pozas , " he said ; " but afterwards they were all taken or killed . Yesterday in Havana ... " " I know , " Conchita said ; " I was in Havana yesterday . I saw them killed . They died with enormous bravery . But not those ? there were others . Know you , Pedro , anything of a young man with hair like gold ? A tall man , thin , with a serious face that smiles but seldom . Know you of him ? " " Si ! " Pedro said . " I spoke with him ! Of them all he was the only one who spoke Spanish ! He required of me proof of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Conchita leaned forward , her eyes filled with light . " What of him , Pedro ? What of him ? " " Dead or taken , I think . Tomorrow you can discover for yourself , Senorita . The last of them were captured upon the finca of that man of enormous evil , Senor Castenada , who gave them drugged wine . It is believed that one of them killed this hacendado before the drugs took hold . At any rate , they are to be brought into Havana tomorrow . If you like , Dona Conchita , I will go into Havana for you and discover whether ? " " No , " Conchita said ; " I shall go myself . " " But , " one of the women protested , " what if they should recognize you ? After that of Nuevitas , your life would not be worth a centavo ! " " I will wear one of your dresses , " Conchita said , " and a turban upon my head , so that they see not the redness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulatta now ; and you shall stain my skin even l arker . " " What of your eyes , Senorita ? Think you they will believe that any mulatta has eyes as green as shoal water ? "  | " Yes . I know some with blue eyes , even . The greenness of my eyes will not preoccupy them . Yes , yes  --  I shall go ! " " And afterwards ? " Pedro said . " If he is alive , we shall save him , and he shall be my husband , for I love him much . If he is dead , we shall avenge him  --  him and my father . " The Negroes looked at her wonderingly . " But how , Senorita ? " Pedro asked . " There are many and we are few . And they have guns  --  many guns . How could we harm the Spaniards ? " " We shall not fight them , Pedro . But in the night we will raid them while they sleep . We shall set many fires and burn their barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we need . And we shall kill an officer here and another there  --  men like Don Juan Costa , and Percher and del Piso and Bailo .... " " Good ! " Pedro said and Conchita could see the other blacks nodding grimly as she mentioned the names of the most rabid Negro baiters among the Spanish officers . " Perhaps we shall die , " she said ; " I do not know . Therefore 1 want only such men with me as are willing to come , and those who will fight for a free tomorrow for their children expecting nothing themselves . " " There is one thing more , Dona Conchita , " Pedro said ; " you must get a few white men to join us , and mulattoes , too , if they will . Else it will be said that this is a revolt of the blacks , merely , and all over Cuba our people will suffer . When we strike , we must strike as Cubans , not as black men or white men or mixed breeds . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " Conchita said ; " it is . I will try , Pedro . Now , if you will forgive me , I have much weariness , and must lie down . You have here an additional hammock , Isabella ? " " Yes , " the woman said ; " come with me , Senorita . " They brought Narciso Lopez , and the two Metcalfes , and Lieutenant Hernandez , and Lieutenant Van Vechten into Havana in the morning . They marched them along the Prado toward Morro Castle , and all the people who could reach them , struck at them with bamboo sticks , or kicked them , and spat into their faces and hurled rotten fruit and lumps of animal dung upon them . Their  | guards made no move to interfere . Long before they reached the Castle they were too tired to walk , and husky infantrymen flanked them on both sides and bore them up by the armpits , their bare toes dragging in the dust . When they were within a hundred yards of the gate , a slim mulatta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face , hard . He reeled back and the guards turned him loose , grinning , while the mulatta slapped him right and left , and right again , and all the people laughed . Then the girl fastened her fingers about his throat and began to strangle him , her face contorted with fury . She thrust her face very close to his , swearing loudly in Spanish , but George realized suddenly that her fingers moved very lightly over his throat without really tightening and between the explosive Spanish oaths she was murmuring over and over again quick English words : " Where is he , George ? Where is my Ross ? Tell me where ? Carramba ! Hijo de la puta grande ! Where ? " Then George Metcalfe saw the green eyes staring at him out of the bronzed face , and a wisp of the reddish-brown hair that had escaped the turban , and with great control he kept his face impassive and murmured through lips that scarcely moved : " Escaped  --  into the woods . Hit me again , Conchita . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard that his lips cracked against his teeth , and the blood came out of the corner and trickled down his chin . He staggered from the impact , and no pretense was necessary . His guards took his arms again and grinned at Conchita , saying : " A sufficiency , little one ! Let us take care of him . And afterwards you can reward us  --  with kisses perhaps  --  or even something more . Where do you live , little Morena ? We have much free time .... " But Conchita was off , running through the crowds , and George Metcalfe had the questionable comfort of seeing , just before she went , that her green eyes were glazed with tears . They marched Ross Pary through the brush toward the road , the ones who had captured him , and every time he stumbled , out of pure exhaustion , they prodded him with the bayonets . He was  | asleep on his feet . They had killed the horse a week ago , and from that time until now , he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had circled through the manigua , doubling back on his trail , never daring to stop , hearing the sound of his pursuers all around him in the darkness . His food had given out three days ago , and yesterday the last of his water . He had thrown away his carbine as a useless encumbrance . They had taken him without a fight , finding him lying in a thicket unconscious from hunger and thirst and fatigue . A Spanish soldier , Ross thought bitterly , can wake the dead when he puts his mind to it ... . It seemed that the march through the manigua would never end , and quite suddenly , he went down on his face and could not get up , and they were beating him , and then they stopped beat . ing him and were shooting into the brush , and then the shooting stopped and they were n't there any more  --  that is , except the ones who were dead . Then Ross felt his head being lifted very tenderly , and he turned his face sidewise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and he was looking up into eyes as green as a tropic sea . " Ross , " Conchita murmured ; " oh , Ross mio  --  mi alma , Oh Sacred Mother of God , I have no words ! " Then she bent down her head and kissed his mouth and all the blacks stood around them in a circle , grinning . " Conchita , " Ross said thickly , " my little Conchita .... " Then he felt himself going out , and strong hands came out of the darkness on both sides of him and lifted him upright and after a time his vision cleared . Conchita was smiling at him , but at the same time , her facie was wet with tears . " Almost I have killed you , my own , " she said , " with this madness of sending you here . But now I have you again and you are safe .... " She put both arms around his waist and clung to him , fiercely . " I shall never send you away from me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ! " The Negroes held his arms and half led , half carried him over to the horse . He felt himself being lifted across the animal 's back ,  | then all the lights went out suddenly and stayed out for a long time . When he awoke , he was in a little hut , and Conchita was bathing his face . Outside a fire had been made , and from simmering pots came a variety of good smells . " How thin you are , my Ross , " Conchita said gently . " You have starved and that too is my fault , because there are so many things I should have taught you . A man can live in the Cuban brush from the palm tree alone . The heart of the palm is both edible and good . " " I ate bananas , " Ross said ; " I 'm sick of them . " Conchita kissed him quickly and got up and ran to the door . A few minutes later black Isabella came in with yucca , malanga , yams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the milk of the cocoanut served in its own shell . There was also a stew of a kind of meat that Ross had never tasted before . But it was very good and he ate it all . " What is this ? " he asked Conchita , as he put the bowl down empty . " Jutia , " Conchita said . " Jutia ? " Ross echoed blankly . " A kind of a rat , " she said calmly . " It is good , no ? " Ross gulped ; then he straightened up , grinning . " Yes , " he said ; " it is good . " Then he started to eat the other things , but long before he had finished , he had fallen asleep again , his head bowed down upon the rude table . Conchita called two of the Negroes and they carried him over to the thick straw floor mat . Then they went out , smiling . After they had gone , Conchita took off her boots and her jacket and lay down beside him , pillowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all night holding him gently , tenderly so as not to awaken him . Then in the morning she got up and went down and bathed in the stream and when she came hack again , he was awake  --  really awake . She knelt beside the mat and kissed him . She knelt there a long time holding his face between her two hands . " My Ross , " she said . Ross smiled at her .  | " We 've got to go , Conchita , " he said . " I have some money-. maybe we could get one of the fishing boats to smuggle us over to Florida and ... " " No , " Conchita said . " No ? " Ross echoed wonderingly . " Many Americans are alive and prisoners . We must try to save them . Yesterday they shot Colonel Crittenden and fifty-two others ; but I do n't think they dare shoot any more now . The American Consul in Havana has told de la Concha it might mean war . But they will imprison them . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see , " Ross said . " Your friends George and Henry Metcalfe are among the pris ? oners . George told me of your escape . Additionally there is the matter of the men who have lived too long now  --  like the fat one , Juan Costa , and del Piso , and Percher . It was the men of Costa who  --  who ? " " The scars ? " Ross whispered . " Yes . " " Then I 'll stay , " Ross said . " It 's madness ; but , as you say ? those men have lived too long . " " Good , " Conchita said . " Then afterwards , we will go back to America  --  if we live . " " If we live , " Ross said . " Conchita ... " Yes , my own ? " " You were here last night , were n't you ? Here in this bohio I mean . " " Yes , " she said smiling , " and also in thy bed , my Ross . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry , " Ross said . " I was so blamed tired that ... " " Do not preoccupy yourself , my heart ; there will be other nights . Now , get up . " Ross looked at her , and a little light showed in his blue eyes . " Instead of my getting up , " he said , " suppose you ? " " No ! " Conchita laughed . " Why not ? " " There is no time . You and I , my soul , must go down to Havana today . " " Havana ! " Ross said .  | " Yes . There is a danger ; but it is not great . You shall shave off that glorious yellow beard of yours , and the Negro women will stain your body brown with a kind of berry . We shall mingle oil and soot in your hair . Then we will go . " " But , " Ross protested , " why must we go to Havana ? " " For news . It is said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for us to know whether or not they will kill the Americans , too . If they do  --  then we must go to Florida at once and make such an outcry that there will be war . In such a fashion will Cuba be freed of Spain . " Ross stood up , smiling . He was surprised at how strong he felt . " Very well , " he said ; " you can start to tarbrush me . " " I 'll call the women , " Conchita said . " Nol " Ross said ? " Not unless my face and neck and arms and legs will be enough . " " Then I will do it . There is a danger of your clothing being torn in the crowds , since we must dress very poorly . Additionally , should the Spaniards become suspicious , the disguise must be good and complete ... " " But , Conchita ... " Silly one ! There was a time once when you turned on a lamp , remember , because I had shame of my body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surpassing handsomeness and very fine . Come ! We shall go down to the stream and you will wash yourself , and afterwards we will come back here and make mulattoes of each other . It should be diverting , no ? " It should , Ross thought , be damned diverting . It was . They came back to the hut and Isabella brought an earthen pot full of a thick brown liquid . They took off their clothing and smeared it all over each other , laughing like children . It was very amusing , and there in the clear morning sunlight that poured into the bohio through every crack , it was also curiously innocent . Ross had a feeling that he did n't want to spoil it . He turned to put on the ragged clothing that one of the Negroes had loaned him . " No , " Conchita said . Ross turned back to her , and put out his arms . " Nor that , my amorous one ! It is only that it has not dried and will come off on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  | upon you , if you take me in your arms . Have patience  --  there will be a moon this big , tonight , and you will have no need of sleep . ing . " " I think , " Ross said , " that I never want to sleep again . " The Spaniards strangled Narciso Lopez in the public square opposite Morro Castle . And Ross and Conchita saw it . Narciso Lopez died bravely ; but it was not a pleasant thing to watch . That night there was a moon that filled half the sky . It silvered the feathery leaves of the bamboo , and etched the royal palms blackly against the night . The little bohios lay in the path of its whiteness , and between them , the Negro Pedro strummed a guitar and sang . Conchita lay in Ross 's arms , with her face pressed softly against the hollow of his throat . But Ross neither spoke nor moved . " What ails thee , my Ross ? " she whispered . " I can not , " Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not after today . I keep seeing him . It makes a sickness in me , little Conchita  --  it makes a debility of a most formidable nature . " " So ? " she said . " I have much sorrow of that , my Ross . We have been too long apart . But do not preoccupy yourself . Come  --  let us go out and Pedro will sing to us .... " They got up from the straw mat and went out into the darkness . Pedro saw them coming and smiled , showing his strong white teeth in the moonlight . " Play , Pedro ! " Conchita said . " Play us something gay ! " The lean , black fingers caressed the strings . Ross listened . frowning . Pedro was a natural musician  --  a master of his instrument . Ross sat down on the trunk of a fallen palm with Conchita by his side , and rested his chin on the palm of his hand , listening . Something in the music stirred him , a strange , half expressed theme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Negro never did . It must have been , Ross decided , an accidental combination of notes improvised on the spur of the moment . How had it gone , now ? He hummed the sounds over quietly , and excite . ment began to rise in him , sudden and strong . This was it  --  this was the thing he had wanted to do for Conchita . " Conchita , " he said ; " get me something on which to write ! "  | " But , Ross , " she said ; " there is nothing , and besides why do you wish to write now ? " Ross did n't answer her . He got up from his seat and picked up a charred stick from out of the embers of the fire ; then he went to a tree , and slashed off a strip of the bark with his knife . Swiftly he ruled in the lines , and then he wrote the notes , slowly , humming them to himself , erasing them with a bit of his ragged shirt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him with wondering eyes . Ross studied the music he had written , then he gave it to Pedro . " Here , " he said , " play this . " Pedro stared at the music , blankly . " I have sorrow , Senor , " he said sadly ; " but I can not read . " Conchita took the piece of bark from his hand and studied it in the moonlight . " But I can , " she breathed ; " I can  --  and this is beautiful ! " " It is for you , " Ross said . " It is you  --  the way you are to me . " " Pedro , Pedro ! " Conchita cried . " Listen  --  listen carefully ! " Then she began to sing the notes , her voice flutelike and clear . She trilled them , birdlike , until the glissandos were like spring water running warm under a summer sun . She sang it all the way through , holding the last note , sending it soaring up high and clear and sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " play that ! " " Ca n't , Dona Conchita , " Pedro groaned ; " nobody could play that ! " " Yes , yes , yes ! Play it ! It goes so  --  listen , oh head of formidable thickness ! Listen  --  hear it in your heart , like I hear it , oh , Pedro ? please ! " She repeated the theme , singing the la-la-la 's , so slowly that Pedro 's fingers could follow them on the strings . Then after a time , he had them and began to play , his black face taut with the effort , then he loosened and the music came out free , warm with tropic sun , and the white wash of seas upon the silver playa , and the wind singing in the ceibas , and the smell of bougainvillaea and frangipani , above all the sun  --  it was drenched in sun , that music , Cuban sun of a clarity and brilliance unmatched anywhere else on earth . Conchita scampered like a child halfway up the trunk of the fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soared  | out and up in a gigantic leap that was like flying , her skirt whirl ing out from her perfect legs . She touched the earth , weightlessly , and pirouetted , her arms and hands sculpturing the air . She had said she was a dancer , and Ross saw now what a dancer was . Not like Morgan , whose dancing was a kind of somnolence , a subconscious expression of the dark forces within her . No , not like that . Conchita came alive when she danced . She was lifted out of herself , became more than herself . Even the crude cotton blouse and skirt she wore became things of beauty , shaping figures , brief arabesques in the moonlight , endowed with plasticity , fluidity , life . And her body , moving , stopped Ross 's breath . Her small feet stamped the earth , flamenco fashion , her hands played maracas , so clearly that Ross could hear them . Her face was frowning , ecstatic , the music flowed around her , into her . Her body melted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no break between the warm flesh moving and the singing , rhythmic line . Pedro grinned at her happily , his black fingers miracles upon the strings . And Ross Pary sat upon the palm trunk and looked at her , feeling her beauty stabbing into him so that even to watch her was the essence of exquisite pain . She broke it at last with a grand jete out of the classic ballet , and fell into his arms , breathless and sobbing . Ross lifted her into his arms and started back to the bohio . " Good night , Pedro , " he called ; " many , many thanks ! " " Of nothing ! " Pedro laughed . " God grant you a son ! " Ross shouldered open the door of the bohio and went inside into the dark . " This of the weakness , " Conchita whispered ; " it is gone now , is it not , my Ross ? " " Yes , " Ross said , " all gone . " " Good ! Now kiss me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tomorrow that I do not die now of too much feeling Oh Ross , Ross , Ross ! " Outside in the clearing , black Pedro picked up his guitar and walked very close to the wall of the little bohio . Then he settled himself down comfortably on the earth and began to play the Dance of Conchita . He played it over and over again , inventing many piquant variations on the theme . He played it tirelessly , all night long .  | And all night long they heard it , and blessed him in their hearts . It went very well at first , before it started to go badly . For a time there was hope among patriots that Conchita Izquierdo and her blond Americano and their savage horde of black machete fighters would be able to accomplish what Lopez had failed to . But when it started to go badly , it went all at once and in every direction at the same time . The Spaniards planted a treacherous black among them , and upon the very next raid , they lost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Triguenos  --  wheatcolored ones , as the Cubans call white men  --  who had joined them . And Juan Costa called Miguel de la Mancha , a favorite of his , a man without heart or fear or conscience , to direct the hunt . Thereafter , they did not know a moment 's rest . They moved through the manigua day and night , never daring to stop , until they dropped in their tracks from fatigue . The disguising stain had faded out , but that was the least of their troubles . When a man fell , they had to leave him , and afterwards they would find him spread-eagled between the posts furnishing food for the vultures . They lay in a thorn thicket , Conchita and Ross and Pedro and three other blacks , all that were left now ; and down below they could see a little church on the edge of the wood . Conchita gripped Ross 's hand fiercely . " Look at the iglesia , " she whispered . " Ross ? " " Yes , Conchita ? " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sin . I can not regret it truly , but we are going to die now . I want to be your wife . It would sweeten the dying , knowing that I was yours in the sight of God and man . " " I have wanted that for a long time , " Ross said . " Then we will go down there . Padre Antonio Ferrer , the priest , is an old friend of my father 's .... " " Wo n't it be complicated ? " Ross said . " After all , I 'm not Catholic and ? " " Padre Antonio will understand that there is no time . We will  | do everything at once , the Instructions and the Baptism and the Sacrament of marriage ... . " And Extreme Unction , " Pedro added drily . " That too , " Conchita whispered ; " but I do not mind this of the dying any longer , as long as I die in your arms . " They got up out of the thicket and walked single file down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy , and Conchita told him what they wanted of him . " There is much that is irregular here , " he mused ; " how am I to know if the conversion is sincere ? " " A man about to die does not lie , " Ross said tartly . " That 's true , but I have doubts that such a marriage as this would bear the scrutiny of my superiors . " " Padre mio , " Conchita burst out , " would you do the will of your superiors or of God ? We have been in sin . If you refuse us we will live still in sin , and thus will we die . Have you no concern for our souls ? Are the rules of the Church more important ? What serves a mountain of dogma now to us who must die within a space of hours ? " The old priest stared at her . " Irregular or not , it is right , " he said half to himself . " Come , my son  --  we have much work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been baptized and confessed . It was , he thought wryly , an all-time record for such proceedings . Then Conchita came out of the confessional box , her face radiant . They knelt before Padre Antonio , and he began the ceremony . But when he came to the rings , they both looked at each other , aghast . Neither of them possessed any . But Pedro stepped forward , a handful of gold rings in his palm . Among this geeat selection they had no difficulty finding one that fitted each of them . And Padre Antonio was too wise and too kindly to ask Pedro where he had gotten them . Then Ross Pary kissed his bride , and they came out of the church in the sunlight and saw the horsemen riding toward them with Miguel de la Mancha at their head . They ran for the trees , firing , and Ross and Conchita and Pedro made it , but the other three Negroes had the good fortune to be killed instantly by the Spanish carbines . Those Negroes , Ross thought , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without much pain . And I , God help me , am going to have to kill Conchita so that they do n't get their filthy hands upon her again . Then it 'll be my turn because 1 could n't stand the tortures . That leaves Pedro . Poor devil , I wonder what 'll happen to him ? They circled through the manigua all night , and all night long there was the sound of horses . But so far , the Spaniards had not brought the dogs up and until they did that , the three of them had a chance . Just before morning they approached a clearing , and the wind brought over the smell of a fire . They crept close to the edge , and Ross saw a grossly fat man surrounded by five soldiers , eating heartily from a pot that hung over the fire . Conchita 's nails bit into the flesh of his arms . Ross turned to her . " Don Juan Costa , " she whispered , " the cruelest of them all . And that way is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back , because others of them are behind us . . . . This is the termination of it , my Ross . Now kiss me quickly and  --  and see that I am not taken  --  by them .... " Ross made a sound in his throat that was like the growl of an animal . " Here , " he said to Pedro , " keep her here . I shall return . " " No ! " Conchita begged . " No , my Ross , no ! " But Ross was down on his belly , crawling through the brush , the machete held in his teeth . When he was close enough , he sprang into the clearing , and brought his machete down the front of one of the soldiers , opening him from breast to navel , and whirling , he cut down two more in half a heartbeat , and met the others rising , and gave one of them the point in the belly and brought the blade sidewise across the throat of the other and rested there panting , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was a mistake for that mountain of a man got ponderously to his feet and brought the barrel of a pistol crashing down upon Ross 's head . The blow did not land solidly but it was enough to stun Ross . He lay on the ground watching the tiny feet of the fat officer approaching . Then he lunged forward , catching Costa 's knees , bringing him down .  | Ross was off then , scurrying through the brush until he came to the place where he had left Conchita and Pedro . They were not there . The ground was torn with the hoof prints of many horses , and Pedro and Conchita were gone . Ross stared at the prints ; then , slowly , his knees buckled under him , and he put his face down in the mud and cried . He got up after a time and marched out of the manigua , straight for the town of Matanzas , which was closest to them , and where , doubtless , his wife and his comrade had been taken . He walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until he had almost reached the town . Then he saw the horsemen resting , and Miguel de la Mancha holding Conchita in his arms and laughing at her frenzied efforts to escape . Ross got the revolver out and came forward firing , still walking at the same slow pace . One of the horsemen dropped and the Negro , Pedro , seeing his chance , dashed out and away from them and two of them started after him , and Ross dropped them both within three feet of each other . Then Don Miguel roared out an order , and the cavalrymen surged forward , and swarmed all over him , beating him with their gun butts and the flats of their sabers ; because the last thing Miguel de la Mancha had said was : " Take him alive ! " Through the rain of blows he could hear Corichita 's voice screaming : " Do not kill him ! Have mercy Caballeros , for the love of God ! " Then a sunburst of lights exploded inside his head and he pitched headlong into absolute darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have much interest in this tawny one , do n't you ? " he said . " He is my husband , " Conchita said . " So ? " Miguel laughed ; " I have always heard that widows make the most interesting of companions . Enough , Caballeros ! We must not cheat the Senor Rubio of the opportunity for a heroic death . " " Beast ! " Conchita spat . " Dog and offspring of a dog ! Do you think to gain anything of me by killing him ? " " The Senora is then disposed to bargain ? " Miguel suggested . " No ! Kill him and be damned . He would not have his life bargained for . " Miguel shrugged .  | " As you will , little dove , " he said . " It is scarcely likely that I could save his life in any event . The Senor Colonel Juan Costa has some interest in the matter . Besides , I return to Spain this week . It would give me much pleasure to take so beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nol " Conchita said . " There remains the fact that your husband will die . I might be able to persuade Don Juan to commit you to my tender care . It would be a better fate than being executed yourself  --  after having furnished some sport for the soldiery .... " Conchita stared at him . " Think you , " she said scornfully , " that I care what happens to me after he is dead ? Think you I 'd even want to live ? " Miguel de la Mancha looked at Ross 's unconscious figure . " Strange , " he said mockingly ; " this thin , pale one with so little of manliness about him  --  and you have for him so great a love . " " He is a thousand times the man of any of you ! " Conchita said . " That will be seen , " Miguel smiled . " Don Juan Costa has ways of testing the courage of any man . " Conchita looked at him and all the color drained slowly out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , no , no , no ! " " I think he will die quite badly , " Miguel said . " These thin , aesthetic ones usually do . In ten minutes , I 'll wager , he 'll beg the Senor Colonel for his life . In twelve , for a more merciful death . " Miguel shrugged his broad shoulders eloquently . " But all that , of course , is up to the Senora . " " Up to me ? How ? " " Men sometimes grow careless , " de la Mancha said . " It is possible that the thin blond one might never reach the Senor Colonel . He might  --  escape . " " How ? Unconscious as he is  --  beaten already half to death , how could he escape , Senor Captain ? " " He might revive . The soldiers might be preoccupied with other matters on the edge of a wood , say . . . . These possibilities exist  --  if the so lovely Senora could find it in her heart to be a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see , " Conchita said . " Of course , Don Juan will be terribly angry with me . But then I am already ordered back to Spain , so his wrath would serve him  | but little . And this poor devil of a husband of yours has so little flesh upon his back  --  it could be removed with so much facility . A few brief strokes and then .... " " Nol " Conchita shuddered . " Please , Senor Captain , no ! " " Then the Senora sees the reasonableness of my point of view ? " " Nor that . When he is dead and I am alone , what is to prevent the Senor Captain from summoning five soldiers  --  one to bind my skirts over my head , two to hold my feet apart , and two to hold my hands  --  arts at which Spanish caballeros are wondrously ex pert ? " Miguel stared at her . " A certain repugnance at such methods , " he said gently . " A faint hope that the Senora 's gratitude toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something deeper and more lasting . The fact that the Senora 's beauty and spirit have awakened in me a deeper emotion than I have ever felt before .... I want no weeping , ravished girl in my bed . Such are the methods of men who can not prevail by the gifts the good God gave them . They dishonor a man . They are an admission of a certain lack , of a certain failure .... " " I see , " Conchita said ; " your sentiments do you much honor , Senor Captain . But what proof have I that you will actually do what you say ? Promises are such empty things . " De la Mancha whirled . " Jose ! " he barked ; " Juan  --  Enrique ! Take the Americano and place him gently in that thicket . Give him back his weapons and leave him there ! " The soldiers stared at him in astonishment . " I gave you an order , " Miguel de la Mancha said . Conchita looked at him , and her green eyes misted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said brokenly ; " I will go with you to Spain .... " It was dark in the thicket , and the mosquitos came down in clouds . Ross sat there dully , not even trying to slap them away . His head ached damnably , and his body was one long bruise . He was trying to think , but his mind refused to work in orderly pat-  | terns . He was unsure of what was real any more , and what was imagined or dreamed . He had come down the road under the algaroba trees , and had seen the Spanish soldiers . That much he remembered . But after that ? He strained his mind , trying to force the mental picture into focus . One of the soldiers had had Conchita in his arms . She had been fighting him , and then he , Ross had started shooting . That was all he remembered . There had been many of the Spanish horsemen  --  so many . Then what the devil was he doing here alive and free ? Had they killed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's body could ache the way his did now ... . Snatches of it : Pedro running away , and the Spaniards falling . The men charging toward him . Then they had started hitting him and .. . And they had thought him dead . That accounted for it . But why then had n't they taken away his gun ? And what was he doing here instead of out on the road where it had happened ? His head ached so ... . But his mind was clearing . He did n't want it to clear . In a little while , he was going to be able to think , to remember something that he ought not to think about , dared not remember . A moment later , he knew what it was : Conchita . He had n't been able to free her . By now she must be in the barracks of the cavalrymen . By now , by now  --  sweet Infant Jesus ? now . . . He put his face down and vomited , but the sickness did n't leave him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why ? What was it to live , remembering  --  this ? His right hand , moving , brushed against the butt of his revolver . Without conscious thought , without any hesitation at all , he took it out , thrust the muzzle into his mouth , and jerked the trigger . The hammer crashed against the empty chamber , and he remembered that he had emptied it , firing at the Spaniards . He took the cartridges out of his belt and began to reload , but he never finished the task , for a company of Spanish infantrymen came through the brush with fat Juan Costa at their head . " There he is ! " one of them cried ; " just where Captain de la Mancha said we 'd find him ! " They started toward him at a rush , and Ross stood up quietly  | and waited , letting his revolver fall to the ground at his feet . Capture by the Spaniards was just as effective as a bullet through the brain . A little slower , perhaps , but just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Senor Americano accepts our hospitality . That is good of him . I can assure him that he will not lack for entertainment . " Ross did n't answer . Words , now , were a luxury he could n't afford . They took him into their barracks , and through them toward a little building of stone . Don Juan unlocked the door , and strong arms propelled him inside , then four or five of them , including the fat Colonel , himself , came in with him . And the moment they were inside , it began . They threw him down face forward on the floor , and Ross saw a big Spaniard uncoil the whip . I wo n't cry , Ross thought . I wo n't ! I wo n't ! But he did . His head thrashed back and forth on the column of his neck and he lay there moaning and sobbing and retching with the terrible spasms of emptiness . To occupy his mind , to hold himself against the surrender they wanted of him , he tried counting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he came back again , he was lying face upward on a table , and they were pouring water into his eyes and mouth . " Ali ! " Juan Costa murmured ; " the Caballero rejoins us ! What a pretty boy he is ! " Then he stretched out his fat hand and stroked Ross ever so gently upon the cheek . " Dog ! " Ross spat at him , " keep your filthy paws off me ! " " How discourteous , " Juan Costa sighed . " I assure you , Caballero , my hands are quite clean . I take good care of them . The ointments which insure their smoothness come all the way from Arabia ... . " Sexless dog ! " Ross screamed at him . " Half woman ! " Juan Costa giggled , a high senseless sound . " You speak Spanish well , Caballero , " he said ; " but your choice of words is  --  unfortunate . Now you have offended me . I do n't like being offended . Ramon  --  get me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tore off Ross 's rags , and , as they did so , a sheet of pliable  | bark , rolled up , fell out from under them . One of the soldiers picked it up and handed it to Juan Costa . He stood there studying it with pursed lips , and Ross 's eyes came open again . He was aware suddenly that Don Juan Costa was humming a tune  --  a very familiar tune , and after a moment he knew what it was : Conchita 's dance . But how the devil ? ? Then , with an effort he looked up and saw that El Gordo , the fat one , was reading the notes from his bark manuscript . The sight amazed him . A man who had brains enough to read music , even , from the expression upon the round , greasy face , to enjoy music , and yet could remain a creature of such sick , obscene bestiality  --  it was beyond comprehension . Don Juan stared at Ross . " You wrote this ? " he demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked you a civil question , Caballero . Please be so good as to answer me . You want more of the whip ? " " I wrote it , " Ross said ; " now leave me be .... " Give him his clothes back , " Costa said quietly . " You , Ramon , help him to dress . " They stared at their commander . " Do as I say ! " Costa squeaked . " I do not kill artists ! Not I , not Juan Costa , patron and amateur of the arts ! " " Well I 'll be damned ! " Ross murmured . " Take him to my quarters , " Costa directed . " Then send my personal physician to attend his hurts . When he has recovered sufficiently , he will play for us , Caballeros . We shall have a party . And there is need of a musician , no ? " They grinned at their commander then , and put the filthy rags back upon Ross Pary . Afterwards they took him to a lavishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . After that , Juan Costa came in with a Negress who bathed Ross gently , and the doctor came a short time later and smeared him all over with a sweet-smelling salve that was wonderfully soothing . Afterwards Costa sent for an orderly who shaved away Ross 's beard , and lifted him onto the couch that had been prepared for him .. Juan Costa settled his fat bulk into a chair , holding the bark before his pudgy nose and studying it . Then he turned to his desk  | and drew out several sheets of paper already ruled for music . He copied the manuscript carefully , in a tiny , delicate hand . Then he turned to Ross , frowning . " There is much here I do not understand , " he said ; " but it is beautiful , I think . The contrapuntal arrangement is extremely interesting . Now tell me , Senor ? " " Pary , " Ross supplied , " Ross Pary . " " Senor Pary , how came you by this theme ? It is so typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , " Ross said weakly . " My late wife , who was Cuban .... " " The Senora is dead ? How unfortunate . " " She was captured early this morning by a group of cavalrymen , " Ross said flatly . " Then you have right , " Costa sighed . " She is dead . Those cavalrymen are beasts ! " Ross stared at him in silent amazement . Costa stood up . " I leave you now , Senor Pary . In a few days you will play for us , no ? " " Yes , " Ross said tiredly , " I will play . " " I have sorrow of the whipping . I did not know you were a composer . There will be no more of that . You will be sentenced to many years at hard labor , and then they will remand you to me  --  at my request . And the labor will consist merely of playing for me . Not of too much badness , no ? " " No , " Ross said ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , my son , " Juan Costa murmured . " It will do you good . " It carne to Ross just before he fell asleep that he was going to see the other side of slavery now . He , who had owned slaves , had become one . But it did n't bother him very much . Nothing did or could any more . But it was fully eight days before he began to feel alive again . Juan Costa had taken very good care of him . Each afternoon , the Negress came in and fed him . The food was excellent , though at first he was able to eat only a mouthful or two . But now he was better . Things connected for him  --  made sense . The stripes on his back had healed enough so that they no longer stuck to the band-  | ages . That was a good thing , for careful as el medico had been , changing the bandages had been very painful . But on that evening of the eighth day since his capture , Ross was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The orderly had come with a message from Costa , requesting that Ross play for them that night . The doctor had expressed his belief that he was now well enough . " Come , " the orderly said . " The Caballeros await you . They have desires of hearing you play . " Ross followed the orderly until they reached a rude wooden hall . In one corner was a battered piano . He marched straight up to it without looking to the right or the left , and sat down , flexing his fingers . Then he began to play . The music was the swift gypsy tunes from the district near Seville . In the very middle of the first one , the men stood up , cheering . Ross glanced over his shoulder to the place where Juan Costa sat . The fat one was flanked right and left by two very pretty boys , not yet out of their teens . he was stroking their dark curly hair and feeding them Cuban sweetmeats , pushing the sugary confections into their mouths with his pudgy fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no concern of his . But now lion Juan looked in his direction . " Maestro ! " he called ; " please play for us your own composition . I have much anxiety to hear it . " Ross sat quite still . He could n't do it . Whatever Conchita had been , whatever she had meant to him would be dirtied by this performance . He could not play Conchita 's dance to entertain her murderers . Yet , if he refused there would be the whip again and other pleasant implements that the Spaniards doubtless had waiting . That they would kill him did n't matter . But how he died did matter . A man should be able to manage the final act of the long tragedy of his existence with dignity . And he could n't manage to die well . Not the way the Spaniards ordered the business of dying . Something had to be done . They were looking at him now , waiting . Then he had it . He put his long fingers on the keys and began to play Morgan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | air , holding the dripping sweet that he had been about to thrust into the mouth of one of his favorites . The chatter of the soldiers stopped . They moved forward as though drawn by invisible cords until they stood in a group around the piano . They listened until Ross had finished it , then they cheered . " Again , Maestro ! " they said . " Play that voodoo music again ! " Don Juan got up and moved ponderously over to the piano . " That is not the piece you wrote ! " he said accusingly . " It is another of the pieces I have written , " Ross said ; " and for tonight , I think a better one , Senor Costa .... " " The Maestro has right , Colonel ! " the men chorused . " Permit that he play it again ... " " Very well , " Don Juan said and went back to his seat between the two boys . But when he had finished Morgan 's music , Juan Costa came back again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Cuban Dance  --  which is ever so much better music than this savage thing . " Ross frowned . There were , after all , limits even to surrender . To preserve his life at the cost of profaning his grief for Conchita was a damnable thing . Very slowly , he shook his head . " No , " he said almost inaudibly , " that I can not do .... " Don Juan put his woman-soft hand upon Ross 's shoulder . " I understand your reluctance to play the piece you wrote for your lost wife in such company , " he said ; " but it is for me that you play it , not for these young swine .... " Ross frowned . Don Juan Costa was a strange man . And yet , in his queer , twisted way , he had tried to be kind . Conchita now , wherever she was , would understand Ross 's impulse to oblige this tender monster . Very softly , then , Ross began to play her dance . But he could not finish it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grins upon the faces of the soldiers , and remembered what they or others like them had done to her , and his stiffened fingers made a crashing discord upon the keys , and he whirled away from the piano and stood up . " No ! " he said ; " I 'll play no more ! " Instantly Ramon , the big Spaniard who had wielded the whip , was upon him .  | " Remember last week ? " : he growled . " I remember , " Ross said quietly ; " but understand this : if every man has his price , he has also some things beyond the purchasing . This music is such a thing , Don Ramon . I 'll play no more . " Ramon drew back his hand and smashed his fist hard into Ross 's face . The blow broke his nose in two places , and sent him down upon the floor , the blood pumping from his smashed mouth . Instantly Don Juan Costa was at his side . " Ram6n1 " he squeaked ; " you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me you want a taste of your own medicine . Luis and Enrique , pick the Maestro up and take him to my rooms . The party is over ! " Lying on the couch , Ross realized finally how sick he was . The strength that had borne him up the first part of the evening was gone . He lay holding his throat hard against the black waves of nausea that rose in him , and the ceiling of the room moved above his head in slow and stately circles . For some minutes he burned furiously , then he was blue and shivering with cold . He had the idea he was dying and the thought was pleasant . So it was that when he first heard the knocking against the windowpane , he ignored it , attributing it to delirium . But the knocking carne again , stronger . Groaning , Ross raised himself and pushed at the casement , it opened outward , easily , and Pedro 's black , grinning face was thrust through the opening . " Come , Senor ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I ca n't , " Ross groaned . " I can not walk , Pedro . " Pedro pushed the sash up still further , and eased his lean body into the room . Then he picked Ross up as easily as though he were a child , and dumped him unceremoniously out the window . Whatever remained unbroken inside his body was smashed now , Ross was sure ; but Pedro came through the window and picked him up again , and started off at a trot , hugging the shadows . Just outside the sentry box two horses waited . " Presents of the Spanish cavalry , " Pedro grinned . Ross looked at the place where the sentry should have been . He was there all right , but he lay flat on his face , and one glance told Ross he would never rise again . " What serves it , Pedro ? " Ross said . " They will only hunt us down again , and this time they will kill us at once . "  | " I do not think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pedro said ; " I do not think your countrymen would permit it . " " In my country ? " Ross whispered . " Si . The boat of my Uncle Tolomeo awaits us not one hour 's ride from here . I beg of you to take me with you to your home in America , for after this Cuba is no longer a safe place for me to be . " " Gladly , " Ross said . " Help me to mount , Pedro . " They came out upon the playa a few miles east of Matanzas , and there , as Pedro had said , the fishing boat was waiting . Uncle Tolomeo hoisted all sail , and they moved out to sea . Ross lay in the stern looking back at the island of Cuba . He kept looking at it until it dropped out of sight . All of his life lay buried there . The next afternoon , Pedro carried the half conscious form of Ross Pary ashore at Key West . For most of the voyage , he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was clear . " There is a man called Harry Linton , " he whispered through his swollen blackened lips . " Ask after him , Pedro . Just say the name . It will be sufficient .... " An hour later , he lay upon the soft feather mattress in Harry Linton 's guest room , and that courtly old gentleman stood staring down at his unconscious face . " Those filthy beasts ! " Harry Linton muttered to himself . " I told Pary what they were like .... " Then , more softly : " I 'll send for Cathy  --  she 'll know just what to do .... "  | Chapter 14 " I LIKE your face much better now , " Cathy Linton said . " You 're ugly , and a man should be ugly . You were much too handsome before ... . Ross put the fingers of his right hand up and touched his broken nose . Cathy 's right , he thought ; I look like a pugilist ! " Do n't worry about it , " Cathy said ; " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross smiled at her , looking into the pleasant face that now he liked better than any other living face in the world . " I 'll take your word for it , Cathy , " he said ; " though how a broken nose can become a man is more than I can see . " " It sure does , though , " Cathy said . " It makes you look more ? more rugged . Your face 's got determination in it , now  --  and character . I like that . In fact I like you much better now than I did before . " " Thank you , " Ross said and looked away from her toward the blue water shimmering in the sunlight . The Isle of Hope was a very pleasant place . He was going to hate to leave it . And Cathy 's pleasant , too , he thought . The first time I saw her again in Key West , I wondered what on earth I ever saw in her before . Now I know . It 's just that Cathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes you forget how she looks . But that 's only the first step . After that you start seeing how she looks again  --  all freckles and a mouth as wide as a cattle gate , and the sunlight in that chestnut hair , and eyes the color of woodsmoke , and a nose as thin as an ax blade , and a figure like a fence post ,  | and I 'll be damned if you do n't start to like it . It 's interesting . which is more than you can say for many a prettier girl . The modeling of the bones of her face is actually exquisite . If she 'd only put on a little flesh , she really would be something . But she never will . She eats like a bird and she 's never still long enough for her food to do her any good ... . " Ross , " Cathy said , " why are you looking at me like that ? " Ross smiled at her . " Because you 're nice , " he said ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd rather be pretty , " Cathy said . " Why ? Put you in a room with half a dozen pretty girls , and every man present would go away remembering you , and forgetting the others .... " " And holding his side and laughing fit to kill himself , " Cathy said drily . " I 'm not fishing for compliments , Ross . " " You do n't have to . I 've got a hunch that most of the world 's really famous women have been interesting rather than pretty . You 've got to learn to be proud , Cathy . " " Of what ? " Cathy snorted . " Of yourself . You 're really something special . I do n't think anyone who ever got to know you well would ever forget you . " " Fat lot of good that does me , " Cathy said quietly , " with you . " Ross looked at her . " Do you want it to ? " he asked . Cathy frowned and looked away from him out over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said seriously . " I knew that was the risk I took when I insisted on taking you from Uncle Harry 's and bringing you here . I do n't see any other men  --  except my brother . How do I know that it 's not just lonesomeness ? " " I 'm sorry , Cathy , " Ross said . " Do n't be . It 's not your fault . Besides , it 's too soon after your ? your wife 's death , anyhow . ... ? ' Ross 's face suddenly took on a forlorn , aged look . " Want to  --  to tell me about her , Ross ? " Cathy said timidly . " No , Cathy . " " I wish you would . It 's terrible to sit and watch you sitting here eating your heart out day after day . Maybe I could help you , Ross . Perhaps I could even make you forget . "  | " Do n't try it , " Ross said gently . " It 's no good to grow too fond of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge of that , " Cathy said . " Come , let 's walk down by the water . " " All right , " Ross said . Cathy gave him her hand and they started out down the winding path that was so cool under the oaks . There was a little wind that blew against them and Cathy lifted up her face to it and her thin nostrils flared . The sun was dropping down toward the bluffs on the mainland , over Burntpot Island , and it caught in her straight chestnut hair and blazed . She moved in light , Ross thought , walking in an excess of illumination , wraith-thin , and fine . The freckles that covered her face and neck were golden in the sunlight , and her wide , generous mouth seemed to take on a warmer color . He could see the red mounting into her thin cheeks , and the ghost of excitement stirred in him . This is two years too late , he thought , or a thousand years too soon .... " When is Harry coming back ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cathy said . " What difference does it make ? He wo n't get the money ... " " Cathy , could I ? ? " " No . Lending Harry money is like shoveling fleas in a barnyard . He 'll lose the place sooner or later , and your money with it , if I were to let you lend him some .... " " But what will you do once The Pines is gone ? " " Go to live with Uncle Harry , I reckon . He wo n't mind . Fact is , he 'll be glad to have me . I 'd be a lot of help to him in the business . " " That 's true , " Ross said thoughtfully . " Besides , down there you 'd meet a lot of young fellows and ... " Cathy stopped . Then she turned and faced him . " I do n't want to meet any  --  now , " she said . " Why not ? " " I 'd compare them with you . And that would finish ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , please . . . " All right , " Cathy said ; " I 'll stop now . " It would have been , Ross thought , a good time , one of the best  | times of all . He remembered the day that Cathy Linton had strived in Key West . He was only half conscious at the time , but he remembered it . She had come into the room with a poke bonnet tied under her chin , and if he had been able , Ross would have laughed . She looked so thin and intense and countrified in her hopelessly old-fashioned dress . She had stood there , staring at him  --  and he must have been , Ross realized now , a sight . His lips were cracked and swollen , and both his eyes were black , and his nose was broken in two places , and then one of the Negroes turned him over so that she could see his back . And it was then that Cathy started to cry . She did n't just stand there and cry . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time and afterwards she took out one of the little cigars and lit it and strode back and forth with her jerky long-legged stride , sending up clouds of smoke that turned the air blue and saying words that turned it even bluer . Then , abruptly , she stopped swearing , threw the little cigar out of the window and began to dress his wounds . And it was then that he started to get better . Cathy had been very good with him . She had been expert and tender and very sure . But it came to Ross now that that had n't been all of it , or even the most important part . The real thing that Cathy Linton had done for him was to make him want to get better . And that , come to think of it , was very curious , for nothing had changed . Conchita was dead . He must still live in voluntary exile from his beloved Moonrise . And there was still Morgan . Morgan . That was the worst thing . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had met her . He could n't keep it up , now . He knew that . He had reached the stage in his life , in the growth of his spirit , when he had to stop running away from things . Why the devil did a man run anyhow ? It was because , he answered himself , he was afraid that he would be confronted with a situation beyond his power to cope with , or to bear . Such situations , being unknown , had all the added terror of the guessed at , of the imagined . But what was there now in his life that needed to be guessed at ? He had journeyed to the limits of human endurance and beyond . He had eaten and slept with  | death . He had seen intimately the very ultimates of depravity . What was there left for him to run from now ? What could Morgan do or say that would hold a feeble candle to what he had already seen and heard ? Besides , there remained one other unassailable fact : wherever a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle , to whatever far island surrounded by terrible seas , he took himself with him . There was no escaping the seeds of destruction he bore within himself , no fleeing the image of his own damnation .... " Ross , " Cathy said softly , " what on earth are you thinking about ? " Ross looked at her . " I was thinking about a woman called Morgan , " he said . " And this one is n't dead , is she ? " Cathy said . " No . Morgan is alive . Too much alive , I think sometimes .... " " You  --  you 're in love with her ? " Cathy said . " No . I hate her . But I ca n't help thinking about her sometimes . " " Why ? " Cathy said . " Because Morgan is your beautiful woman , Cathy . And the beauty that should exist to give comfort and pleasure to someone has always been used by her as a force of darkness , as a weapon of terrible evil . You reminded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical beauty . A black panther is a beautiful animal . Some species of snakes are beautiful . A tiger is beautiful . And they all  --  kill . " " This Morgan is like that ? She kills people ? " " She has n't yet . But I think she would without a qualm if it suited her purposes at the moment . But murder is not a subtle enough art for her . 1 think she 'd enjoy much more having one man kill another over her  --  or driving a man to kill himself .... " " You make her sound perfectly fascinating , " Cathy said . " She is . She 's married to my best friend . It would n't surprise me in the least if trying to live with her does n't drive him mad one of these days ; that is , if he escaped being killed in a duel with one of her lovers . " " Are you one of her lovers , Ross ? " " Heaven forbid ! " Ross said .  | Cathy caught his hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the drifting sand . The waves came in from the sea , blue and very quiet until they were close , then they broke upon the beach with a roar , eddying out in foamy whiteness . " The sea , " Cathy said , in that odd , dry voice of hers ; " it goes everywhere , Ross . It touches all the shores . You throw a stone into it and the ripples wash up on the shores of China . I think sometimes that life is like that .... " " Why , Cathy ? " Ross said . " There are n't any private acts . Everything we do makes ripples . The good and the evil . And they touch everybody finally  --  everybody in the whole damned world .... " " That 's true , " Ross mused . " Your niggerman , Brutus , only wanted his wife back  --  and that made a ripple that washed you to me . Your  --  your wife never heard of me , but she sent you down to Cuba and here you are again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life . I wonder about that , Ross  --  it 's got a pattern , has n't it ? ? these recurring ripples , I mean . And now this Morgan  --  what kind of a wave will she make that will touch my life ? Maybe , the third time , if you 're tossed up in my lap , you wo n't be able to leave .... " " You 'd like that ? " Ross said . " Yes , " Cathy said ; " I 'd like it very much , Ross . " Ross sat there looking at her a long time . She has , he thought , the best and most honest eyes in the world . And that funny , freckled face , once you get used to it , is downright restful . If ever I began to feel again , she might mean something to me . If ever I dig up my heart again , it may very likely be hers . . . Cathy looked back at him ; she did n't move or say anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quietly , she moved closer , and raised her face to his , tilting her head back , closing her eyes . Ross looked down at the warm , red mouth , full-lipped and gen erous . It wavered there , inches below his own . " No , Cathy , " he said gently . " Forgive me  --  but  --  no .... " The gray eyes came open slowly , staring at him . Ross could see them searching his face , quick pain moving in their depths . Then the pain was gone as suddenly as it had come . " You 're right , " she said , in that flat tone of hers , " it 's too soon ,  | is n't it ? She has n't been dead six months . I 'm ashamed of myself , Ross .... " She looked at him , smiling a little , now . " That was why you would n't kiss me , is n't it ? " " Yes , " Ross said , " that was why . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fond of me  --  kind of . " " I am very fond of you , " Ross said . " I 'm glad , " Cathy sighed . " Well , that 's that . Come on , let 's go back now . " Ross took her arm and they walked back to the lovely old house , They found young Harry Linton sitting on the veranda staring morosely into the gathering dusk . " You did n't get the money , did you ? " Cathy said . " No , " Harry said curtly . " Harry , " Ross began , " suppose I were to ? " " No ! " Cathy said sharply ; " I wo n't have it , Ross ! " Harry looked at her wonderingly . " Why not , Sis ? " he said . " If Ross could tide us over until I got in one good crop ... " " No , " Cathy said . " I 'll take the risk , Cathy , " Ross said . " Besides I could never repay you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to be paid . Besides , it 's not a risk . It 's a downright certainty . Harry 's no planter and the soil 's plumb worn out . It would cost damn near as much in guano as we 'd get out of it . Another thing , say you made it possible for us to stay on here another year or two  --  would you really be doing us a favor , Ross ? We 've been cooped up here all our lives . Maybe Harry would make his mark in the world outside ; maybe I 'd be happier .... " " That 's so , " Harry said . " Maybe I 'll come out to Mississippi and take a look around .... " " Do , " Ross said . " Anything I can do to help you out , I 'll be glad to . " " When does the bank plan to take over ? " Cathy asked . " Tomorrow . We 'll all have to pack tonight . Sorry , Ross . " " It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I was getting home anyhow . " " I wish you never had to go home , " Cathy said ; " never , never . never ! "  | " And I , " Ross said , " wish I had a home to go to .... " Do n't you have a home ? I thought ? " " I have a house , " Ross said . " A home 's a different thing . Home is where the heart is . Good night , Cathy  --  I ' 11 see you in the morning . Night , Harry . " " Good night , Ross , " Harry said ; but Cathy did n't answer him at all . Nothing had changed about the city of Natchez , sitting high on the bluff , watching the river bend itself around the green and golden Louisiana shore . Nothing had changed , yet everything was different . It was quieter . It had taken on a certain serenity . And the wind moved through the oaks and the magnolias with a noise like sighing . The roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boughs of the oaks interwoven above them , shutting out the sky . The great houses sat under the trees , brooding and silent . And when Ross Pary came up Silver Street from the steamboat landing , no one greeted him at all . He walked up past the Esplanade , and up Main Street toward the building in which he had both his apartment and his office , and just before he reached it , he saw Morgan Brittany coming toward him . Ross groaned . He had wanted more time to himself before risking an encounter with Morgan . But he was done with running away , so he waited quietly until she came up to him . Morgan continued to walk until she was only a few feet away from him , then she stopped short . " Ross ! " she cried out ; " Ross Pary ! Oh , Ross  --  your lace  --  your face ! " " Yes , " Ross smiled ; " it 's a mess , is n't it ? " " Oh , no ! It 's  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging victorious from the battle . You look brutal  --  even a little cruel . But you still have your poet 's eyes . Why , Ross Pary . I think you have just about the most exciting face in the world ! Do you live up to it ? " " I have lived up to it , " Ross said . " Tom told me you escaped that bloody fiasco in Cuba . The Metcalfes are back , too . It seems that the Spanish Government did n't want to risk a war by killing any more Americans . Some  | are still prisoners , though . Colonel Wheat is in a dungeon in Spain . The State Department is moving heaven and earth to get them out . How I chatter ! It 's a sign that I 'm getting old . " " You will never be old , Morgan , " Ross said . " Thank you . That 's a very nice thing to say . If Cuba has made you like me a little better , then bless Cuba , I say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had n't changed . " No , " he said ; " Cuba has n't made me like you any better , Morgan . Only you could do that . " Morgan moved up to him until she was very close , and stood there with her head tilted to one side , watching him out of those black eyes . " How ? " she murmured ; " how could I make you like me , Ross ? " " You might try being a little kinder , " Ross drawled . " You could develop a little respect for people . Then I 'd like you . That way I 'd like you very much . " " I 've always been kind to you , Ross . " " You 've never been kind . You do n't even understand what it means . Oh , yes , you can be very sweet when it suits your purpose ? but only to gain your own ends . Ever tried a little disinterested kindness , Morgan ? Ever thought of being decent for decency 's own sake ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What nonsense ! " she said . " Of course not . And neither has anyone else  --  not even you , my saintly Ross . People are never good for goodness ' sake . People are only good because they are afraid . That 's where I differ . I 'm not afraid . " " You are impossible , Morgan , " Ross said . " Now you 've said something . I 'm absolutely free of illusion and that is impossible . The world wo n't permit that . It kills such clear ones . It will kill me , finally . The cowardly dogs gather together in packs and hunt down the lone wolf . And men must kill the solitary tiger , because his very existence threatens their lives . Oh yes , one day I shall be killed . I know that . " " I do n't doubt it , " Ross said coldly . Morgan smiled at him . " Now , " she said , " you 're going to take me up to your apartrnent and tell me all about Cuba @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'd have me start my homecoming by running the risk of fighting a duel with Lance ? " " Why not ? Then one of you would kill the other and I would be rid of one of the two men who trouble me more than anyone else on earth . " Ross smiled at her grimly . " And which one of us died would n't make any difference to you , would it , Morgan ? " " Yes it would make a difference . Before you went away , it would n't have . But now it does . I 'm sick of Lance , Ross . If you 'd kill him I 'd be ever so much obliged to you . " " Then you wo n't be obliged to me , " Ross said . " I do n't fight duels , Morgan . And I 've killed enough men now to last me ten lifetimes . Besides , I 'm very fond of Lance . " " The sickening old fool ! " Morgan snapped . Then , just as suddenly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross ? How exciting ! Do tell me about it ! " " No , " Ross said . " Look , Morgan  --  I ca n't stand here in the street any longer talking to you . I 'm very tired , and everything you do makes a scandal . I 'll ride out to Finiterre one day soon , and then we 'll talk  --  all three of us : you and I , and Lance . " " You are going to talk to me today . I 'm going upstairs with you right now . " " Morgan  --  please ! " " Do n't try to appeal to my better nature , Ross , " Morgan laughed . " You know well I have n't any . " She hooked her arm through his . " Come on , " she said . Ross looked at her . " All right , " he said sullenly ; " but do n't try anything , Morgan . " " Vanity , thy name is man ! " Morgan laughed . " I wo n't ravish you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're very strong , despite your thinness . Besides , no matter how much you deny it , there 's a bond between us . I do n't want that bond broken . I 'm not sure I could control you if I permitted you such liberties . Ross  --  my beautiful Ross with the battered face . You do n't know how exciting it makes you look ! " " So I 've been told , " Ross said . " Who told you ? Oh , your little Cuban , of course . How is she . Ross ? So far you have n't mentioned her name . "  | " She is dead , Morgan . " Ross said flatly . Morgan stopped still upon the second stair . " Oh ! " she said . Then : " I 'm sorry , Ross . Believe me I am . " Ross stared at her in pure astonishment . " That , " he said , " was the last thing on earth I expected you to say . " " I know . I 'm unpredictable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? truly . " " Why ? " Ross said . Not because she 's dead . I do n't give a fig if any woman lives or dies . But because she was good for you . She had that air of fine bitchery that another woman can spot in a minute . And that was what you needed , darling  --  to give your own ponderous solemnity a jolt once in a while . A man always sheds his dignity along with his trousers  --  thank God ! " " Do n't be vulgar , Morgan , " Ross said . " Why not ? Nearly everything of value in life is . But you 'll find that out for yourself . " They came into the apartment , and Morgan put down her parasol and her bag and started moving about , taking the covers off the lamps and the furniture . " I do have my feminine impulses , " she said . " It 's so ghostly in here with everything covered up . " The word caught Ross 's attention . Ghostly . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The air was alive with them , whispering . Here , in the place it had begun . There  --  upon that bed . If he listened hard enough , Ross was sure he would hear the scamper of Conchita 's quick moving feet . In the shadows , if his eyes could pierce the veil of mortality , he 'd be able to see her smile . It came to him then , that he would n't be able to stay here any longer . He 'd never be able to endure the nights when nothing would stop the thinking . There was no opiate against memory  --  no specific against anguished loss ... . " Tell me , Ross , " Morgan said ; " how did she die ? " Ross 's head lifted slowly , and his broken face was ugly with pain . " The Spaniards captured her , " he said drily , " and tortured her to death . We  --  we had been married an hour before .... " " You could n't save her ? "  | " " I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him in breathless fascination . " And tortured you , too ? " she whispered . " Yes . " Morgan came up to him , and let her fingers stray over the rugged contours of his battered face . . " What did they do , Ross ? " she moaned . " Tell me , what ? " Ross stared at her . The tone was  --  ecstasy . " No , " he said brusquely . " Please , Ross  --  please ! " " They smashed my face in with their fists and gun butts , " Ross said evenly . " They threw me down and beat me with a whip . " Morgan put the palms of her hands over his ears and kissed his mouth slowly . There was , Ross realized , no one who could kiss like Morgan . " My darling , " she murmured ; " my beautiful , battered darling ) There is n't any more softness in you , is there ? They 've taught you how to be cruel  --  have n't they ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Morgan stood away from him , and looked up into his face . " I think I 'm going to marry you , " she said . " You 're my kind of a man now . " Ross frowned . " Must I remind you that you already have a husband ? " he said . " I know . I 'm sick of him . He 's sick of me . Now you can kill him for me . " " Why do you want him killed ? " " Because I 'm tired of him . He 's gotten old and querulous  --  and he 's no longer adequate . I 've thought of taking a lover . But that 's no good . " " The Morganian theory of ethics , " Ross said wryly . " Why not , Morgan ? " " Because a lover would be too demanding . Having no real hold over me , he 'd try to bind me to him . He 'd be watchful and suspicious  --  and I could n't stand that . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Morgan said , " would have no need to . " " At the risk of being repetitious  --  may I ask why not , Morgan ? "  | " Because I 'd only marry my kind of a man . Lance was , once . But he is n't any more . You are  --  you my darling with that face of yours that was excavated from the ruins of Pompeii ! And I 'd be absolutely faithful to you , as long as you knew how to treat me . You know that now  --  Ross , you know it ! " " Yes , " Ross said quietly ; " I do know how , Morgan . I reckon I 've known how all along . Like a circus trainer with a tigress . Force . Cruelty greater than yours . Only I do n't think I 'd like it . " " Oh yes you would . The rewards would be adequate . " " Considering the fact that I have not the slightest intention of murdering your husband , I do n't see ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan laughed . " I 'll be rid of Lance , and you wo n't have to lift a finger . " She went up on tiptoe and kissed him  --  hard . " There ! " she said ; " now we 're en-gaged ! " " Well I 'll be damned ! " Ross said . " Ross , " Morgan said ; " tell me something else  --  you said you killed some men . How , did you kill them ? " " Why do you want to know that ? " " Just so . Oh , I 'll tell you . I 'm trying to find out something about you . Tell me , Ross  --  how did you kill them ? " " With a gun , mostly  --  in battle . Some of them with a machete .... " " You mean those big cane knives ? " " " Yes . " " Did you , " Morgan asked eagerly , " did you enjoy it , Ross ? " Ross frowned . He thought about Castenada and the five soldiers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said quietly . Morgan clapped her hands together gleefully like a child . " Yes , yes ! " she cried ; " you have it  --  the kind of hardness a man should have ! You 'll do all right ! Now , Ross  --  one more question and I 'll let you be : Why did you enjoy killing them ? " " One of them , " Ross said , " had betrayed my friends into the hands of the Spaniards . The others  --  threatened Conchita 's life . It was a pleasure to kill them . As pleasant as I sometimes think it would be  --  to kill you . " Morgan caught the lapels of his coat . " Yes , " she said ; " I shall marry you  --  Ross . Now you are capable  | of killing me . You were n't before . Ever noticed how everything close to death is heightened ? The sword of Damocles , Ross . All pleasures are richer , when snatched under the very shadow of death . " Ross thought about black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled a little , sadly . " That 's true , " he said ; " that 's very true . . . . " " You 're remembering her , are n't you , Ross ? " " As a matter of fact , I was . What difference does it make ? " " A lot . I do n't give a fig about a living woman ; but I wo n't play second fiddle to a ghost ! You 've got to forget her , Ross . " " And you , " Ross said , " have got to learn right now that you do n't tell me what I 've got to do . My life is my own , Morgan . 1 do with it what I please . " " Right , " Morgan said . " If I could make you do what I wanted you to , I 'd hate you . But I 'll keep on trying . That 's the nature of a woman . " She went over to the table and picked up her parasol and her bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look how peacefully I 'm going this time . Wo n't it he nice when I do n't have to go at all ? " " Yes , " Ross mocked , " very . I shall wait very patiently . But now that you 've confessed your great love for me , I expect anything to happen . " " Love ? " Morgan said . " Who said anything about love , Ross ? What 's love got to do with it ? " " I do n't know , " Ross said . " You tell me . " " Love , " Morgan said , " is an infantile emotion that afflicts fools . I 'm quite incapable of loving anyone , Ross  --  even you . " " But , " Ross drawled , " since , according to you , we 're going to be married , once Lance has been safely disposed of  --  what sort of relationship can exist between us  --  if you do n't believe in love ? " " This sort , " Morgan said , and clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling , " she whispered ; " you should be very useful  --  after dark . . . . " Then she was gone , slipping easily through the half opened door . The next afternoon , Ross rode out to Moonrise on a rented nag . Nancy , his blooded mare , was stabled out at the plantation.  | He 'd have to retrieve her . Riding this bag of bones was pure misery . When he came up the drive , the Negroes stared at him curiously as though they had never seen him before . But Simon , the butler , who had known him longer than any of them , recognized him at once . " Marse Ross ! " he quavered . " Thank the dear Lord , you 's home again ! Yassir , thank His Name ! " He stopped , staring . " Marse Ross , what done happen to your face ? " " A mule kicked me , " Ross grinned . " The folks at home ? " " Yassir  --  they 's here all right . They and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? doggone it , I never could say that name ! " Wallace came up behind him and stood there grinning at Ross . " Bear , " he said . " Oh Bear ! Ai n't that a funny name , Marse Ross ? " " That depends , " Ross said . " What is this gentleman 's business , Simon ? " " I do n't know , sir . He comes up here to see Miss Annis . " Ross stood there a moment , frowning and thoughtful . So Annis has a suitor ! Little Annis ! Let me see  --  her birthday was last month , and this is 18552 ? my God ! Annis is all of eighteen years old ... . " Tell them I 'm here , Simon , " he said . " Yassir , Marse Ross ! Right now ! " Simon scurried away down the hall . After a moment Ross heard him coming back , and after him a rush of many feet . Tom and Jennie came first , each of them carrying a child in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God ! " Behind them Annis came shyly leading a tall young man by the hand . He was tall and dark , and exceedingly handsome . There was a Latin flavor to his looks , and all at once Ross understood the name the Negroes had been trying to say . Aubert  --  a Creole name , obviously . Pronounced French fashion , it did sound like Oh Bear . Jennie drew a little ahead of the others , but when she was close enough to see Ross 's face , she stopped dead . She peered at it a long moment , then , helplessly , she started to cry . Ross could see Annis ' face paling , and her fingers tightened  | convulsively around young Aubert 's hand . Even Tom was silent then , his heavy brows drawn together in a frown . " Good God ! " he got out at last , " what happened to you , bovi You look like you smacked into a locomotive  --  head on ! " " Compliments of the Spanish garrison at Matanzas , " Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll get used to my face . I have . " " But you used to be so handsome ! " Jennie sobbed . " And now you look like  --  like ? " " A bandit , " young Aubert supplied . " One of the more romantic sort . How do you do , sir ? I 'm Danton Aubert . Annis has been telling me all about you .... " Ross took the hand that Danton Aubert offered him . " Not the truth , I hope , " he said . " Hardly , " young Aubert laughed . " No man could be as wonderful as your sister thinks you are . " I am going to like this one , Ross thought . He has poise and assurance and those things require something to back them up . " Let me see the children , Jen , " Ross said . " I did n't know a thing about them . Tom wrote me once or twice while I was iii Georgia  --  but he never even mentioned the babies .... " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called the boy Peter after my father . We named the girl after Annis  --  she does look like Annis a little , do n't you think ? " Except that one of the babies was dark , and the other was blonde , they looked like babies to Ross . He could n't even tell which was the boy and which the girl . But he sat there holding them both in his arms , looking from one of them to the other , thinking : These could be mine  --  if I were blessed with any luck . But whatever my destiny is , it certainly does n't include happi ness .... Then he gave the babies back to their mother . " They 're lovely , " he said . " Which one is Peter ? " " Oh , Ross ! " Jennie said . " The little fellow with the black hair , " Tom said , " Looks just like his pappy , do n't you think ? " " Well , " Ross grinned , " since we 're reasonably sure of who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , Ross , " Annis said , " what a perfectly outrageous thing to say ! " " Have you had anything to eat ? " Jennie asked in some confu-  | sion . " You 're so thin , Ross ! We 've just finished dinner , but there are an awful lot of things left . " " I am hungry , come to think of it , " Ross said . " Well , Tom ? congratulations . They 're a fine pair . " " Do n't mention it , boy , " Tom grinned . " Just wait until you see the next six or seven . " " You 're looking at them right now , " Jennie said . " That 's all there 're ever going to be . " Something in her tone caught Ross 's attention . A note of grimness  --  even of suppressed fury . I wonder what Tom 's done now , Ross mused . Oh well , it 's none of my affair ... . He sat at the table and ate the good food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ross , " she said , " tell us about Cuba , wo n't you ? " Ross straightened up , frowning . " All right , " he sighed ; " I 'll get it over with . I 'll have to sooner or later . " - Then he told them . The silence afterwards had thickness and texture . It could be felt . Ross stood up , hearing the quick , rasping intake of the women 's breaths , the first , half strangled sobs . " I 'm sorry , " he said ; " but you asked me . " Then very quietly he walked down the long hall and out of the house . He stood on the gallery a long moment and Tom came out of the house and threw his big arm over Ross 's shoulder . " I 'm sorry , boy , " he muttered ; " I 'm mighty , Goddamned sorry ... . " It 's all right now , " Ross said .  | Chapter 15 RAOUL BERGSON , the great impresario , sat at his favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Montparnasse section of Paris . He always sat there at that particular table , under that particular chestnut tree , every day at the same time . He had done so for years , so that Le Coq d'Or had become a second office for him . Anyone who wanted to see him either on business or merely to enjoy the wit for which he was famous , knew precisely where to find him . In a very real sense , M. Bergson held court there , surrounded by a circle of admirers , his pudgy hands flashing diamonds from every finger , including his thumbs , a petite cognac resting untouched before him on the table . When he finally drank the cognac , that was a signal . His petitioners and friends knew that the interview was over . But this spring day of the year 1853 , only one man sat opposite M. Bergson , a seedy , unimportant individual called Paul Dreyfus . This caused the great impresario a certain twinge of annoyance . " Raoul , " Dreyfus wheezed , " what of your new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? " " ' There 's nothing to tell , " Bergson said . " 1 have n't even seen her . Andre is quite excited over her , but you know Andre ? everything excites him . " " Are n't you going to ? " Paul Dreyfus asked . " Yes , this afternoon . I have a feeling about this girl . I can not define it , my old one , still  --  there is this feeling . A Spanish dancer ? the times should be good for such a one , is it not so ? If she  | has anything  --  any kind of esprit , any verve  --  name of a camel ! I had no idea it was so late ! " " Tomorrow you will tell me about her , then ? " Dreyfus asked . Bergson shrugged , and drank a little cognac . " If there 's anything to tell , " he said . He got up then and proceeded along the sidewalk with his curious rolling gait , which , together with his short , fat figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , he was sitting in the first row of a shabby hall watching the Spanish girl dance . She was a beautiful girl , with reddish-brown hair and green eyes . She was , M. Bergson decided , much too thin ; but he suspected that her thinness was not usual with her ; plainly she had fared very badly of late . But before she was halfway through the first flamenco , Raoul Bergson knew she could dance . Ma foi , he mused , I wonder if she knows how good she is ? I hope not  --  for that would make a great difficulty over the question of pay . The girl had finished the dance now , and stood there , waiting . " Encore , " Bergson said ; " something different , this time . " The girl launched into a baile gitano  --  a gypsy dance , and Raoul Bergson felt the excitement rising in him . Once every century  --  one like this one ! He could see the marquees of the theatres now  --  here in Paris , in London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , he 'd dream up a name for her . He stood up , smiling . " Enough , my little one . It is good . If you will come tomorrow to my office , we will discuss the terms of a contract . I can not promise you much , still , I must confess that as a dancer you are not too bad . A few faults here and there , but with time and work they will eradicate themselves . " The girl stood there , unmoving , a sullen expression upon her face . " M'sieur , " she said , her French marked by a heavy Spanish accent , " could we not discuss it now , tonight ? There are certain difficulties .... " M. Bergson waved an imperious hand .  | " That is an impossibility , child , " he said . " Tomorrow , we will talk . Till then , au ' voir . " He had half turned , when he saw her sway . He turned back again , but he was too late . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reached her , Raoul Bergson saw that the faint was no counterfeit . " Andre ! " he bellowed ; " Bring water  --  brandy  --  come quickly , enfant  --  Name of a name ! " His young assistant came flying from the wings , and together they carried her into one of the dressing rooms . One of the musicians came in carrying the cheap handbag she had brought with her . He stood there holding it and watching while M. Bergson got a stiff draught of brandy down her throat . She blinked and opened her eyes . Raoul looked at her almost tenderly . " How long has it been since you have eaten , little pigeon ? " he said . " Four - days , " the girl said weakly . " Andre , " Bergson barked , " go order a cab . For this little one the finest meal in all , Paris . Your forgiveness , Mademoiselle  --  I was a dolt not to have noticed . " " It is nothing , " she said . Then she saw the musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . The man started forward , but halfway across the room , he stumbled over Raoul Bergson 's cane and dropped the bag . It burst open , strewing its contents over the floor . And the great impresario got down on his knees with the musician and a stagehand to gather up the girl 's meager belongings . He came up , holding a piece of a newspaper in his fat hands . Moving over to the light , he saw that it was from a provincial town in the Pyrenees , near the Spanish border . " There is much excitement , " he read , " touching the complete escape of the assailant who wounded the illustrious Captain Miguel de la Mancha of the Spanish Army . The captain had been spending a few days in France , accompanied by a beautiful woman . Police are searching for his charming companion , in the belief that she might shed some light on the mystery . " The impresario folded the newspaper clipping and passed it over to her .  | She took it , silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Come , my child , " Raoul said , " let us go . " Raoul Bergson was , in his way , a diplomat . He waited until the girl had finished a meal as good  --  almost , as the ones he usually ate himself , before he pressed the matter . He leaned forward across the table and smiled at her kindly . " Well , little pigeon , " he murmured ; " why did you do it ? " The girl looked up fearfully at a passing gendarme . Raoul put out his pudgy hand and took hers . " This is not a matter for the police , " he said . " In prison you are useless to me . Out of it  --  you could be very useful , I think . But if I am to protect you from the consequences of your folly , I have to know the details . I assure you , Mademoiselle , that this is not the idle curiosity of an old man . Have the goodness to tell me , please ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What she saw reassured her . Though Raoul Bergson thought of himself as a hard man , his kindness actually was a Parisian legend . " He betrayed me , " she whispered . " Ah  --  so ! " Raoul chuckled . " Cherchez la femme . Now there is a woman I 'd like to meet , the one whom a man would betray some one as pretty as you for . " " There was no other woman , " the girl said . M. Bergson 's face was genuinely puzzled . " This , " he said , " is a new kind of a marvel . There is no other woman and yet , your lover betrayed you ? " " He was not my lover , " the girl said , " though in a way he was . I did n't love him  --  I ? I hated him ! " " Name of a little pink sow ! He was not your lover , yet he was your lover and you hated him . On top of all this he betrayed you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Please have the goodness to unravel all these mysteries ! " " He  --  he killed my husband  --  or had him killed , after promising me that he would spare his life . It is all very simple , M'sieur . We , my husband and I , were revolutionaries in Cuba . We were captured , and I bargained with Captain de la Mancha for my husband 's life . My husband did not know this . For even though he faced torture , he would not have permitted it .... "  | " The captain , doubtless , found you attractive ? " " Yes . I promised to come to Spain with him , if he freed my husband . He did so , but afterwards , he gave the word to the soldiers where my husband , who was wounded and unconscious , might be found . " " There is only one thing unclear in all this , " Raoul said ; " how did you discover the betrayal ? It appears to me extremely unlikely that he would have told you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain nobleman , who also thought that a mere captain should not be allowed to retain possession of a barbaric Cuban Senorita , whose savagery lent her a certain charm in his blase eyes . " " So Captain de la Mancha brought you to France ? " " Yes . But he also asked me to marry him . As he would finally have to go back to Spain , his only hope of keeping me if this hidalgo , this Grandee of Spain , really put forth some effort  --  was to marry me . I pointed out to him that marriage was not possible since I was already married . It was then that he made the grave error of telling me that I was , in fact , a widow . " " Then ? " Raoul prompted . " Then I put several inches of knife blade into his carcass , and left . The rest , you know . " Raoul stared at her . " Ma foil " he murmured , " you are a savage creature ! " " Yes . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your name ? " " No , I am called Conchita . Habaneras means the women of Havana . " " Habar era .... " Raoul mused ; " La Habanera ! That 's it ! Thank you for that , Mademoiselle . " " For what ? " Conchita asked . " For giving me your professional name  --  a name that will someday be known round the world . " - " Then we do not remain here in France ? " " But no ! The discoveries of Raoul Bergson are known in every capital of Europe , and in the New World as well . " " We go to America , then ? " " Yes  --  to New York and Chicago and San Francisco , and New Orleans . "  | " New Orleans , " Conchita breathed ; " 1 should like that . Yes , should like it very much . " " Come , little pigeon , " Raoul Bergson said . By that same spring of 1853 , Ross Pary had accomplished many things : He had risen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public buildings in Jackson , Baton Rouge and New Orleans had been designed by him ; he had established connections with architectural firms in New York , so that when the day came that he could leave Natchez , he would find a position waiting for him ; he maintained a friendly correspondence with Cathy Linton , realizing that the attraction that he had felt toward her was merely the upsurge of his despair ; and he managed the tightrope act of keeping up his friendship with Morgan Brittany without letting it develop into something more . Last of all , he had begun to educate his slaves with the view of freeing them as he had promised his lost Conchita . It was the state of the nation that troubled him , rather than his personal life , as he rode toward Finiterre that morning . The very air was big with destiny , and the feeling disturbed him . He had had enough of destiny ; his part in the shaping of history had been sufficient , he felt , to last any man a lifetime ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old wounds in wet weather ? that what was happening , what was going to happen would not leave him alone . The talk of secession was not yet ended ; the interventionists mouthed their grandiose dream of a slaveholding empire stretching from the Mason and Dixon Line to the Amazon , which the Northern States , properly chastened , would be permitted to rejoin again  --  in their rightful place as junior partners  --  as culturally inferior domains . They talked glibly  --  almost gleefully , of war , if necessary ; and Ross , who had seen war , grew cold and sick ... . He rode along on Nancy , his head bent forward on his chest , that face of his which had been that of a Phidian Apollo , and was now that of a battle-scarred Roman legionary , frowning and thoughtful . He paid little attention to the Negro who came limping up the drive , a bundle slung over his shoulder on a stick . Then the bundle itself attracted him . Runaway slaves  | commonly slung their few belongings into such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep to the highroads in broad daylight where the roving patrols were certain to capture him . He stared at the black curiously , and at the same moment the man threw down his bundle and raced toward him , his black face split in an enormous grin . " Pedro ! " Ross cried ; " now what the devil ... " " Senor Ross ! " Pedro laughed ; " I found you ! It has been a journey of formidable distances and of an immensity of trouble ; but I have found you ! " The Cuban Spanish rolled off his tongue like gatling gun fire . Ross , who was out of practice , had some difficulty understanding him at first . But the story was soon told . Pedro , ever restless , had tired of his work on the Linton estate in Key West . Key West was too much like Cuba  --  he wanted to see more of the world . So , armed with a letter from Harry Linton , and a few words of English , he had made his way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but each time , his swift Spanish and Harry Linton 's letter had been enough to convince the sheriffs that he was no fugitive . He wanted to stay here with Ross . He would make the Senor a good bodyservant . As for wages , his needs were few ; whatever the grand Senor Ross wished to pay him would be good and sufficient . All he asked was that he would not be enslaved ... . " Have no fear of that , " Ross said grimly ; and taking out a pencil , scrawled a note to Jennie , telling her who Pedro was , and directing that he be fed and given a place to stay . Then he rode on , toward Finiterre . As he rode through the gate , he saw his sister Annis riding toward him with Danton Aubert at her side . Even from that distance , Ross could see that her face was radiant . Love , he thought , is a wonderful thing  --  when well managed and accompanied by luck ; but without luck , it is terrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He rode up to them , and Annis looked at him , and lowered her head , then raised it again , covered with blushes and confusion . " Ross , " she whispered , " we  --  we ... "  | " We 're going to be married , sir , " Danton said ; " with your permission , of course , and that of your brother . " Ross studied them gravely for a long moment . He had already taken the trouble to investigate the Auberts . They were sugar planters , and fabulously wealthy . Beyond that , they were gentlefolk , with generations of birth and breeding behind them ; courtly Louisiana Creoles with all the old-world charm of manner . He admired , too , Danton 's assurance , his completely unselfconscious ease . It was a trait that Ross could admire . His own had been so dearly bought . " You have it , " he said slowly , " and my wish for your happiness ... . He put out his hand , and Danton took it in a firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet upon her cheeks . " You think Tom will agree ? " she asked anxiously . " Oh Ross , I 'm so afraid to ask him ! " " Do n't be , " Ross smiled ; " he 's already told me how pleased he was about the whole thing . " " That 's good , " Danton said . " It certainly takes a load off my mind . One other thing , sir  --  could I persuade you to bring Annis down to New Orleans to meet my parents ? Mistress Jennie is much too busy to act as chaperone , and it 's something that has to be done ... . " Gladly , " Ross said ; " When are you two planning to take the fatal step ? " " Oh , not until next year , " Danton said . " My father insists that I take my Grand Tour first . He 's old-fashioned in that regard . Of course I shall enjoy seeing London and Paris , but I 'd rather do it on my honeymoon than alone ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Annis said teasingly . " Then you can show me all the places that you got into mischief in . I sha n't speak to you for a month after you return . Then I 'll forgive you , but only because I ca n't help it . " " I sha n't get into mischief , " Danton said stoutly . " I have two brothers , " Annis told him , " so I know men ! " " But neither of your brothers had the incentive I have to keep out of trouble . Quite the contrary . It seems to me that their romances have always led them into it .... " Right , " Ross smiled ; " see that you are wiser . "  | " Do n't worry about that  --  Ross , " Danton said . " I shall call you Ross now  --  that is if you do n't mind . " " I do n't mind , " Ross said . " Well , au revoir for now . I 'll discuss our visit to New Orleans later .... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Ross reached Finiterre he saw Lance Brittany jumping his magnificent hunter , Prince , over the high gate . He did it once , and whirled the gray stallion about and came racing back toward it again . This time Prince stumbled the barest trifle on the takeoff , and his left hoof caught the : topmost bar high up and took a splinter out of it a yard long . But Lance hauled back on the reins and steadied him so that he came down on all four feet with just a little stagger . Then he rode up to Ross with a grin . " There 's life in the old man yet , " he said . " I can still do it , Ross . " " That , " Ross said angrily , " was a fool thing , Lance . What the devil are you trying to prove ? " " That I 'm less than a thousand years old , I reckon , " Lance said bitterly , " which is exactly the way I feel . " You look it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no black left in it anywhere , and the lines about Lance 's mouth and eyes that had not been there before . So this is what being married to Morgan does to a man . . . . " Is Morgan at home ? " he asked easily . " Yes . Come on , we 'll ride up there now and have a bourbon . " " No , thank you , " Ross said . " I do n't really want to see Morgan , Lance . You 'll forgive me if I admit that I 'm not too fond of your wife . Let 's ride down into the city instead , and have our drinks there . " " All right , " Lance said . " But first I have to see how Smithers is coming along with the planting . Come with me  --  if it is n't against your new-found abolitionist principles to watch slavery in operation . " " My principles , " Ross said , " have received just about the same treatment as my face . With the same results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your face has , " Lance grinned . " That 's one thing I agree with  | Morgan about . You were a mite too pretty before . Your features were so damned regular that they gave you a womanish cast . Now you look like a man  --  and one hell of a man at that . Bet the wenches look at you now and get the shivers thinking of how delightfully you 'd manhandle them , given half a chance . " " They 'd sure be disappointed , if it were put to the test , " Ross said . " Well , come on  --  let 's ride . " They rode down into Natchez an hour later , and stopped at Connelly 's Tavern . All about them the talk rose hot and angry , the word " secession " being repeated over and over again . " That Stowe woman ought to be tarred and feathered ! " a man said . " Imagine her writing a book like that one . What the hell does she know about slavery anyhow ? Heard tell she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Too bad old Henry Clay had to croak . He was a good man . We 're going to miss him . When he passed on I said to myself , there goes the last chance of settling this thing short of war .... " " You would be in hot water , " Lance smiled , " if they knew how you felt . " " But they do n't , " Ross said ; " and I do n't aim to tell there . When I 'm ready , I 'm going to put the Negroes on a boat bound for Liberia and get on another one myself headed for New York . " " We 'll miss you , " Lance said seriously . " You 're the only friend I have left  --  that I can trust , I mean . I 'm damned glad you are n't fond of Morgan : " Ross put his glass down . " That reminds me , " he said . " Lance , do you know why Morgan is so afraid of the dark and of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How the devil did you know that , Ross ? " he said harshly . " She told me . I ran into her downtown one day , and we got to talking . It came up some way , I do n't remember how ; but even talking about it made her look ill .... " Lance sighed . " I do n't really , " he said . " It has something to do with her father , I think . My guess is that he must have punished her as a child by locking her up in a closet . She 's never said . I do n't think she remembers it consciously , herself . " He looked at Ross quizzically . " You 're smart , " he said . " Is that why you have so much patience with my bad temper ? "  | " Yes , " Ross said . " Thanks , " Lance said drily . He stared away from Ross into the mirror over the bar . " Morgan 's walking a mighty narrow line , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing that , I ca n't behave like an ordinary husband . More than half the time what I feel for her is  --  pity . I think that 's what gets me more'n ordinarily riled at the men she gets mixed up with . Ca n't the fools see it is n't them  --  as people , as men  --  that interests her ? " " Then what is it , Lance ? " Lance stared at him . " Power , vengeance  --  who knows ? " he muttered . He looked about him at the angry , gesticulating drinkers at the bar , and his face took on an expression of distaste . " Bottoms up , boy , " he said gruffly ; " I have to go .... " The rains came late that spring , after the blooming of the flowers . Ross had come back from taking Annis to New Orleans by the time they , started . The Auberts had been all he had expected : fine , cultured folk . He had delighted them by speaking French to them . Everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his Grand Tour , and the wedding had been set for the week after his return . But , once the rains started , it seemed that they would never stop . And rain always reminded Ross of Conchita . He remembered her with him before the fireplace , and outside the soft whispering of other rains . It had seemed so safe then  --  so safe and certain and enduring . And now , less than two years later , it was a lost thing , remaining only in memory ... . He studied the little daguerreotype that Cathy Linton had sent him . The picture did nothing for Cathy  --  nothing at all . Her piquant coloring was absent from it ; the picture showed only her thinness and her plainness , emphasizing certain unfavorable features  --  the size of her mouth , for instance . But Cathy 's mouth , Ross remembered , was one of her good features : it was warm and generous . The picture did n't show that . Her head imprisoned in the photographer 's wire rack , Cathy looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim . And Cathy , God knew , was none of these . . . . He put the picture down and moved to the window . Outside  | was only rain and mud , oceans of mud , a gloomy landscape to contemplate . So he turned away from the window and took down a decanter of bourbon from the cabinet , and began to drink it . It had little effect upon him at first except to increase the painful somberness of his mood . He had given it up when he heard the light sound of booted feet upon the stair . The tread was not heavy enough to be that of his brother , Tom  --  nor yet the girlish skipping of Annis . It sounded like  --  Morgan . It was . She came into the apartment and tossed her hat and gloves carelessly on a chair , and moved toward him without a word and kissed him on the mouth . Then she turned away , humming , and picked up the decanter of bourbon . She poured herself a tall glassful and walked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . He saw her stop and stiffen . Then she put out her hand and picked up Cathy 's picture from the table . " And who the devil is this little witch ? " she said . Ross looked at her . " Cathy Linton , " he said ; " a friend of mine . " " I did n't know you had any women friends  --  except me . " " Well you know now , " Ross said . " Yes , " Morgan said , " I do . I do n't like this wench , Ross . I do n't like her at all . " " Why not ? " Ross said . " She 's homely . Therefore she 's dangerous . " " An ingenious conclusion . Why , Morgan ? " " Because she must be terribly interesting . You would n't have her picture if she were n't . " " Right , " Ross said ; " she is interesting , Morgan . She 's one of the most delightful little creatures I 've ever met . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get used to her . " " That , " Morgan drawled , " would take some doing ! " " It did . But the results were worth it . " " You say she 's not homely . Prove it , my boy  --  prove it ! " " I do n't know if I can . You 'd have to see her , and looks are a matter of opinion anyhow . It 's her coloring , I think . Her eyes are as gray as woodsmoke , and her mouth 's naturally red .... " " There 's enough of it , " Morgan said .  | " Yes , there is . She has lovely chestnut hair , and she 's freckled all over like a setter pup .... " " All over , Ross ? " Morgan drawled . " At least as far as I 've seen , " Ross said . " All over , " Morgan said drily . " Go on . " " She 's as thin as she looks there , but most of the time she wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetching .... " " I can imagine . Tight pants , no doubt . " " Tight pants . And she smokes little cigars , and can outcuss any muleskinner you ever heard . " " Quite a girl . What else can she do well , Ross ? " " I would n't know . " " Gallant , are n't you ? But you do know , do n't you ? Damn you to hell , you dot " She was standing before his chair now and her face was twisted with rage . You 'd think I 'd betrayed her , Ross thought suddenly ? that she were mine to betray ... . " If I did , " he said drily , " I would n't tell you . It happens that I do n't . I 've never so much as kissed Cathy Linton . You can believe that or not as it pleases you ; either way I do n't give a damn . " Morgan straightened up , staring at him . Then , slowly , she smiled . " They did something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she said . " You used to defy me before , but never like this . Before you were always angry  --  and a little afraid . Now you sit there and tell me flatly that you do n't give a damn what I think . And you do n't , do you ? You really do n't . " " No , " Ross said , smiling a little , " I really do n't . " Morgan looked at him , the pupils of her eyes dilating in the dim light . Then she lifted her glass and drank it all , and set it down before him noiselessly , with exquisite , expressive control . " Another , " she said quietly . Ross picked up the decanter and poured the glass brimful with a steady hand . Morgan picked up the glass and stood there holding it and looking at him . " You too , " she said . Ross poured his own glass full .  | Morgan drank half of hers and turned away from him , swaying a little . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said hoarsely . " Before you would n't have dared do that . You would have refused to give me any more  --  and you would n't have touched it yourself . You used to run away from me when things got a bit thick . But you would n't run , now  --  would you , Ross ? " " No , " Ross said . " I 've done all the running I 'm ever going to do  --  all the hiding . I have to face up to things sooner or later . Now is as good a time as any to begin . " Morgan brought the rim of the glass up to her lips . She held it there , looking over it at Ross a long time . Then , very slowly , she drained it . Ross drank his , too  --  all of it . He held the glass between his fingers then he threw it away from him into the fireplace . It broke , and the pieces lay upon the hearth , catching the light . The flame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and burned blue for a moment , then settled down again . Morgan walked over to the fireplace . Standing above it , she opened her fingers and let her glass fall , adding to the shattered fragments and the little wetness . She stood there watching it , until the little whiskey she had had left in her glass began to smoke from the heat of the fire . Then it blazed , making flickering blue shadows on her face . She turned back to Ross , watching him , catlike  --  her body drawn down and in a little , and Ross got up out of his chair and came to her . The fire made a cackling sound  --  like laughter . ? Morgan put her arms up about his neck and swung her weight from them and hung there staring up at his battered face until it blurred out , pf focus . Then she parted her lips and closed her eyes . She tore away from him finally , and ran ahead of him into the droom , and Ross followed her and stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the long , clean , good whiteness of her limbs . Then he looked beyond her at his little bed and the ghost of Conchita Izquierdo came into the room and stood between them staring at him with accusing eyes . " Not " he said hoarsely . " No , Morgan  --  no ! " She stopped still .  | " Why not ? " she whispered . " Not here , " Ross said thickly . " Not here , Morgan ! " Morgan looked at his eyes and traced their line of vision past her to the little bed . Her hands came away from her clothing and anger flamed up in her . " Not here , " she said very quietly , " not here  --  not upon her bed . That would dishonor her memory , would n't it , Ross ? Damn your soul to hell , I told you I would n't play second fiddle to a ghost ! " Then she lunged forward all at once , and her hands moving were invisible with speed . Ross felt four white-hot streaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand came away with bloody nails . He put his hand to his face and it came away dark with his own blood . Then he moved toward her and caught the front of her riding habit in his left hand and slapped her right and left and right again so that the sound of it was like small arms fire and her head jerked upon her neck and the tears jetted out of the corners of her eyes , arcing out and away from her face under the impact , leaving her cheeks dry . Then the rage was gone out of him leaving him nerveless and cold , and he opened his hand , and she crumpled bonelessly down upon the bed and lay there sobbing , making a hot , strangled sound like a whipped child . " I 'm sorry , Morgan , " Ross said . She pushed herself up on one elbow and lay there staring at him , the tears running down her face chasing one another down across the corner of her mouth and her face red and swollen , the finger marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding from both corners ; but she straightened up smiling , and put out her hands to him . " You beast , " she moaned . " You big , ugly , savage beast ! , God , how long it took me to get you untamed ! " She came up off the bed and put her mouth to his so that be could taste the hot , salt tang of blood . Then she pushed her nait t into his back so hard that , he could feel them through the stuff ; , of his lounging robe . Bringing his hands up , he broke her grip . " No , " he said , " not here , Morgan . I told you , not here ! " She whirled away from him then and ran into the front room , and he came after her slowly , thinking : This is wrong , wrong , she is still Lance 's and I , Oh , God , yes  --  I ? But he was in the  | front room and she whirled against him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remainder of her own clothing . He tried to draw back , but she locked her arms about his neck and hurled herself down backward and away from him , still holding on so that he was drawn down too and lost his balance at the last and fell heavily with her . God help me , Ross Pary thought , while he could still think ; God in His mercy help me ! Her face , when she left the apartment , had all the sweet innocence in the world . Afterwards , as he rode away from Finiterre in the blackness of just before dawn  --  upon another night  --  so many other nights now  --  the rain drove needles of ice into his face . He rode bent forward in the saddle , his hat pulled down over his eyes so far that he did not see the man on the big gray horse until he was almost upon him . He put his hand under his coat to reach for his pistol ; but it came away empty : the pistol was not there . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my forgetting it . Then the man rode in close and Ross saw that it was not Lance Brittany after all , but his brother , Tom . " What the devil are you doing out here ? " he said . Tom looked at him steadily , through the driving rain . " The same thing as you , " he said , " trying to see her . " " Then you do n't any more ? " " Rarely , " Tom said . " She has other interests now . Reckon you 're one of ' em , boy . Maybe even the main one . Nothing to keep you from being . You 're not all tied up . " " But she is , " Ross said . " Come on . " They rode into the stableyard at Moonrise in the darkness , but inside the stable , Tom lit a match and put it to the wick on the oil lantern . He turned to open the gate to one of the stalls , and then he saw Ross 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , boy  --  you look like a dead man ! " " I am a dead man , Tom , " Ross said . " Hell , " Tom snorted ; " do n't talk like that , Ross . Tumbling a wench never killed anybody . "  | " No , " Ross murmured . " Reckon you 're right , Tom . I 'm not dead . It 's nothing so simple as that  --  and there are worse things Tom stared at him , " Worse than being dead ? " he said brusquely . " What kind of things , Ross ? " " Things like human bondage  --  like not being your own man any more . Like becoming a woman 's creature  --  her toy . The thing upon which she satisfies her appetites . Something less than human , Tom . That 's worse . " Tom Pary looked at his younger brother pityingly . " You know , " he said , " I kind of reckoned it would be like that . " " You were right , " Ross said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , tiredly , through the thinning dark .  | Chapter 16 " THAT CUBAN Negro of yours , Ross , " Morgan said ; " that Pedro ? keep him away from here , wo n't you ? " She was walking about her room at Finiterre , holding a goblet of brandy in her hand . " Did n't you hear me ? " she said . " That Pedro ? " " I heard you , " Ross said . " I 'll keep him away . You  --  you 're beautiful , Morgan . " . " I know , " Morgan said ; " So I 've been told ? " " Who told you ? " Ross said . " My husband , of course . And your brother , Tom . " Ross said , " Morgan , how did you get like this ? " " Like what , darling ? " Morgan drawled . " The way you are . You were n't born cruel . " Morgan looked at him , pausing momentarily in her savage pacing . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something happened . Something twisted you . What was it , Morgan ? Tell me  --  what ? " Morgan came over to where he was and sank to the floor beside his chair , as gracefully as a cat . She put both her elbows on his knees , and rested her chin upon her hands . Again , damnably , her face had that aspect of childlike innocence . " I do n't know , " she said ; " does it matter ? " " Yes , " Ross said ; " it matters very much . " " Why , Ross ? " " Because I 've been trying to hate you , and I ca n't . That 's  | a curious thing . Since I 've known you I do n't remember your ever having said or done a single thing that was n't evil . I should hate you for that . I should despise you for what you 've done tome ... " What have I done to you , darling ? From the number of gallants hereabouts who 've tried every trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half trying , I ca n't sec where you have cause for complaint . " " No , " Ross said slowly ; " you ca n't see it . I do n't think 1 can even make you see it , you being what you are .... ' " " Try , " Morgan whispered . " You 've made me hate myself . Ever looked into your mirror and shuddered with self-loathing ? " " No . Why should I ? I 'm very nice to look at . Even I can see that . " " You are , " Ross agreed . " But you 're blind , Morgan . You ca n't look into your mirror and see the face of an adulterer staring out at you . Tarquin 's face , ugly with sated lust . I see that . I say to myself , Lance was my friend , and I have betrayed him . That 's bad . But what is really bad is to stand there and say : And I 'm going to betray him again tonight and tomorrow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . That 's worse than bad . That 's terrible . I do n't like being a slave , Morgan . Nobody 's slave  --  not even yours . " " You are n't my slave . If you were , I should whip you . You 're my lover , Ross . Such a wonderful lover , tool So strong and so tireless  --  so brutal , too  --  when I goad you into it . I like you best then . You should always be brutal . Tenderness is a kind of weakness . " " Or a kind of strength , " Ross said tonelessly . " Who knows . I do n't like what we 're doing . A man like Lance should n't be made to wear horns . He has too much dignity to play the cuckold well . I do n't like it , Morgan . " " Why not ? " Morgan laughed ; " has n't it been  --  fun ? " " No it has n't . I do n't like going home with a tiredness like death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth-torn . You call this wrestlers ' duel to the death we engage in  --  love ? Or me ? your lover ? You 've made me something less than human , Morgan ? an instrument to serve your pleasure ; the toy of your quite  | fiendish appetites . There 's no end to your hungers , is there ? And they 're all evil .. . . That brutality you insist upon  --  what kind of a sickness is that ? No , do n't answer . You ca n't , because you do n't know . I think that 's why I do n't hate you  --  why I pity you , I ca n't hate you , because you have n't been born yet  --  you 're not a person , not a living woman ; you 're evil incarnate , permitted for a little time to walk this earth  --  you said that yourself once , did n't you ? " " Yes , " Morgan said unsteadily ; " I did . " " I think that the day that you are born , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light ; out of that poisonous maze in which you wander , into reality , the recognition of yourself , of what you have been , will burn your heart to a cinder , and you 'll die . You 'll die mad  --  screeching . Oh yes , Morgan you 'll die . . . . " " You do hate me , do n't you ? " Morgan said . " No . How can I ? You do n't exist . What I 'd like to know is how you managed to escape life ? Tell me that , and I 'll know why I can not hate you . " Morgn turned away from hirn , stretching her long legs out before her . Then she lay back , her head resting upon his lap . do n't know , Ross . The things you say , do n't mean anything , really . And yet they seem to mean something  --  a kind of meaning beyond meaning . If I could understand them , I 'd enter into your world . Then , maybe I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ? The answer to that one , my battered darling , is I did n't . I was born into life . I was drowned in it so that it  --  all of it seeped into me through my very pores . More than other people ever know , more than they can feel . . . . It used to wash over me in the darkness  --  like a wave . . . . " She raised her head , staring away from him out the window . " I used to lie upon my little bed when I was a child , and listen to the sounds of it in the darkness . Father would n't let me have a light . He wanted me to be brave . I 've hated darkness ever since . The house we had was built above the Hudson . It was very big and very old . At night , it creaked , and the wind tugged at it , outside . . . . And sometimes I would wake up and hear my mother 's voice . I never could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be begging my father  --  imploring him . Then afterwards , she would scream . That scream is in my blood , Ross  --  it  | comes out sometimes , and 1 have to hit someone , hurt someonesee blood . . . . I was terrified of my father , as a child . And yet , 1 loved him . He was the most fascinating man you could eves meet . I told my mother once that when I grew up , I was going to marry him , too . I 've never forgotten the look upon her face . It was death , and horror  --  and that 's a part of life , too , Rossone of the parts I did n't escape . " When I grew up , I found out other things about my father . My mother loved him and hated him , but the love was stronger . I adored my mother , and when I found out about the other women  --  so many other women , Ross  --  I decided I 'd kill my father , so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't . I loved him too much . . . . Does this make sense to you ? " " Yes , " Ross said curtly ; " it does . " " When I was fifteen years old , one of the stableboys tried to rape me . I beat him , because I was terribly strong even theta . I told my father about it , and he took his crop and beat that boy . I watched it . It made me feel wonderful to watch it  --  all soft and warm inside , and melting .... Father ordered him off the place but he could n't go right then , because he could n't walk . So Father let him stay until he was well enough . But in the meantime there was this French actress , and Father forgot the stableboy . " " But you  --  did n't ? " " No . I kept wondering what it would have been like if I had n't beaten him off . So one night I crept up into the loft over the stable where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was petrified with fright . In the end , I ravished him . He begged me for mercy , finally , and the next morning he disappeared . " " There were  --  others ? " " A few . But I soon found out that most damnable of masculine traits  --  the supreme ego of the human male . They started acting like they owned me , and lording it over me , and trying to tell me what to do . But I 'd had enough of that from my father . Nobody tells me what to do ; I 'm my own mistress , Ross . After that there were n't any more lovers  --  except in the way I 'd worked out . There 's nothing more delightful than to watch them puff out their feathers , sure of a conquest , then stop them dead . Because men are all little boys  --  whistling in the dark ,  | trying to keep up their courage  --  trying to delude themselves into believing they are lions instead of the wolves and jackals they really are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me all men had one face and that face was the face of my father . I wanted to smash it  --  I wanted to destroy its insufferable conceit . That 's why I avoided marriage . As soon as I 'd known the man long enough his face became the face of my father .... " " You married Lance , " Ross pointed out . " I had to . We were penniless , mother and I. Father had just died , after squandering the last of his money and Mother 's . We did n't know until afterwards in what terrible shape our finances were . He died in precisely the fashion you 'd have expected him to  --  in the arms of his latest actress . And Mother followed him a few weeks later , of a broken heart . I swore then , that I 'd never have a heart to be broken  --  that I 'd never be beaten by life . And I have n't been , Ross , I have n't been ! " " No , " Ross murmured ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyone as lovely as you would have had all life 's bounties laid at your feet . But by this dehumanization of yours , you 've cheated yourself ; you 've thrown away your birthright . " Morgan stood up , laughing . " What nonsense ! " she said . " Perhaps , " Ross murmured . " But there 's one thing you have n't told me , Morgan . " " What 's that ? " " Why you have such a horror of being shut in , and of darkness . " Morgan 's face was suddenly sullen . " I do n't remember , " she said . " Now you 're lying , " Ross told her . " 1 can always tell when you are , now . " " Oh , all right ! Though why you must know that is more than I can see . Father locked me in an upstairs closet once when I was a child  --  to punish me . I do n't remember what I had done . Then he went away and met one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't come back until the following night . Mother thought he had taken me with him  --  he often did , you know  --  for days at a time .... "  | " And you stayed in that closet all that time ? " " Yes  --  without light . Without too much air . It took them four hours to get me to speak after they got me out . Mother said I was rigid  --  like a statue , The strangest part about it is I do n't remember it at all . " " You do n't remember it , " Ross said , " then how ? " " Only because mother told me about it . I had a nightmare once  --  after I was grown . I dreamed that I was locked in a kind of a ruined building . It had been destroyed  --  by fire I think , and I was caught in the ruins . Mother heard me screaming and came into my room and I told her , She said : You must have been remembering .... " " Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be going now . I 'm not up to an encounter with Lance this morning . " " Nor any other morning when I 've finished with you , " Morgan laughed . " ' Bye darling . Kiss me good-bye , then go . I must have my beauty sleep , you know . " Ross kissed her lightly , standing away from her , and bending forward so that his lips merely brushed hers . " You call that a kiss ? " Morgan murmured . " No , you 'll have to do better than that ! " Then she arched her body upward against his so that it fitted from breast to toe-tip into every contour his leaning body made . Her head went backward and at an angle , and the hot , wet underfiesh of lip and tongue-tip clung with their old , accustomed expertness . Why was it that in this at least , Ross thought bitterly , that familiarity bred no contempt ? That here , indeed , was only the added savor of anticipation ? Morgan whirled away from him , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " and remember , keep that Pedro away from my Bessie  --  he 's giving her too many ideas . " How Pedro could give anyone ideas with that mangled English he had learned in the not quite a year he had been at Moonrise was more than Ross could see ; but it was of little importance , anyhow . " All right , " he said ; " I 'll do that . " Riding away from Finiterre , Ross turned the whole thing over in his mind . How long had it been going on ? Almost a year now . Let 's see , he mused , it started just after Aubert left for Europe , and he will be home again in another month . Jennie and Annis  | are making preparations for the wedding now . And to think that I used to berate Tom about being a slave to the flesh . Well , who 's the slave now ? More than any black . We own their bodies and their labors , but their souls at least are free . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've sold my immortal soul . . . . Perhaps , he thought wryly , this " irrepressible conflict " that Senator Seward is accusing us of forcing , will free me of her . A minie ball severs all bonds ... . Back at Moonrise , where he could stay now , as often as he liked , since he had removed by his own actions the bone of contention between himself and Tom , he looked in for a moment upon Jennie and Annis . They were busy with their sewing ; for though both he and Tom had offered to purchase Annis ' trousseau from the finest shops in the land , the women had refused them , preferring to make it themselves . There was , Ross guessed , a certain satisfaction in being married in a gown you had made yourself . " Well , " he said ; " how 's it going , girls ? " " Oh , Ross , " Annis wailed ; " we 'll never be done in time ! " " If , " Ross smiled , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army , you would be done . It 's such a waste . You would look lovely even in a gunny sack , Annis . .. . " Thank you for saying so , " Annis said , " even if it is n't true . Oh , dear ! Jennie just look at this sheering  --  how awful ! " " Do n't worry about it , darling , " Jennie said . Ross closed the door quietly behind him and went upstairs to his room . He lay down across the bed and stared at the ceiling , an unlit cigar stuck into the corner of his mouth . There was work to be done at the office but he did n't feel like going there ; his assistants could take care of it without his being present . He had to do some thinking  --  now was the time that the decision had to be made . Most people went through life without knowing themselves ; by dreams and evasions they magnified their better qualities , and pushed the things they were ashamed of out of sight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position with one of the architectural firms in New York or Philadelphia or Boston . He had business connections in all three of those cities . Of course ,  | to run away again was a confession of cowardice  --  an admission that he could not cope with Morgan Brittany or himself . But why not make the admission , since it was true ? Was n't it better to be a coward , to run , than it was to live here in shame ? It was a weakness to fly , but if he stayed , would he have the strength to break with Morgan ? He groaned , thinking of it ... . He got up from the bed and went into the bathroom . After he had bathed and shaved , he felt better . The decision actually was no decision at all  --  self-preservation was a law of life . If he remained in Natchez , Morgan would destroy him . If he fled , she would be forced to turn once more to Lance . Annis ' future was taken care of . Jennie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Only he hung whimpering upon the edge of life ; in him only was existence all past and no future ... . In the North , he could start all over again . He was not old . At thirty-two he had vigor enough to start a great career ; better still , he had wisdom and maturity enough to avoid repeating the errors that had wrecked so much of his life . There might even be the companionship of a gentle , understanding woman , though love was gone from him now  --  forever gone . Conchita and Morgan , between them , had managed to rid him of his capacity for love ; Conchita , through remembered sorrow  --  Morgan with the fires of her strange , unholy passions ... . He dined alone in his room , pleading a headache . As usual , he scarcely touched his food . Then , after he was sure that the family had left the first floor of the house , he came down into the salon and seated himself at the piano . He tried to play Conchita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first line , the memory of her was so bright before his eyes that he could not go on . It seemed to him that her green eyes reproved him from the shadows  --  that wherever she was , she felt injured and betrayed . If he had loved again , if he had married , that , Ross felt , her wandering shade would have understood , could have forgiven ; but this ugly , loveless passion for Morgan was quite another thing . It had to end  --  and now . He got up from the piano and left the house . He walked down to the edge of the bluff overlooking the river . He sat down under an oak and smoked a cigar , looking out over the Mississippi toward Louisiana . Lance was over there , busy with his planta-  | dons . Often he worked so late that he did not come home at all . He always told Morgan when he planned to be absent , which was a mistake , for it let her know exactly when she could safely send for Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's friend . Under any given set of circumstances what had happened made no sense at all . It did Ross 's conscience no good at all to remind himself that he had been driven to it . " He was my friend , " Ross quoted bitterly , " faithful and just to me ... And how have I repaid him ? No  --  let Morgan rage all she cared to , he would never spend another night with her . It grew dark slowly . A star hung in the pale dusk and winked at him . A little breeze stirred the moss on the oak trees . And the surface of the river darkened . Ross sat there until it was entirely dark . Then he got up stiffly , and went back up to the house . Early as it was , he undressed and went to bed , hoping that he would not be plagued by visions of Morgan . An hour later , he awoke to the realization that he had been dozing  --  that he actually was going to be able to sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his pillow . He came awake slowly in the blackness of midnight , and lay in ' that curious state between sleep and wakefulness , listening to the shouting . It seemed to him that the voices were calling his name . " Ross ! " they called ; " Ross Paryl Come on out  --  you and Tom ! " Hell of a kind of dream , Ross thought , and turned over . Then he saw that his window was red with the glare of torches . He was up at once , racing for the window . Down below , the yard was filled with more than a hundred men , mounted and armed . He pushed his head far out of the window . Among them he recognized George and Henry Metcalfe , Charles Dahlgren , Henry Montcliffe , and Levin Marshall . " Come on down , Ross , " Henry Montcliffe called ; " there 's trouble out at Finiterrel The niggers have revolted ! " Ross 's face grayed . Ever since Nat Turner had led his revolt in August 1831 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in dread of what it grandiloquently called " servile insurrection . " He did not for one second doubt the report . With Morgan  | Brittany as mistress of Finiterre , the Negroes had by now , he was certain , excuse enough to rebel ten times over . " Coming ! " he called down and raced for his clothes . As he reached the lower hall , he met Tom , pistol in hand , running for the door . Outside , a dozen eager hands helped them to saddle their horses , then the whole band rode off pounding through the night towards Finiterre . " How 'd you know about this ? " Ross asked George Metcalfe as he rode by his side . " A good nigger came out to Richmond and told Levin , " George said . And that , Ross thought bitterly , was always the history of the Negro in slavery . The good ones , the fawning , hat-in-hand ones , the ones who got the old boots and the cast-off garments and a kindly word from their masters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state of Ross Pary 's mind that he could not admire that kind of a black . It was always the proud ones like Brutus , the daring , like Pedro , who captured his sympathy . With his ready ability to put himself in the other man 's place , Ross could well imagine what it was like to be held a slave . And he knew what he would do in such a circumstance  --  what , indeed , he had done : run away , fight , kill anyone who tried to place this monstrous indignity upon him . If that night , Ross rode with the pack , his heart was with the hunted . They came up the drive to Finiterre , and before they reached it , they could see it burning . The fire , Ross was relieved to see , had not yet gained much headway . With a little luck , they 'd be able to put it out . Then , as they reached the house itself , they heard the shooting . Lance Brittany stood at a window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay dead upon the ground , but the others stood behind the trees and shot back . Where the devil had they got the guns ? Ross wondered . But he did n't get a chance to think about it any more , for the horsemen thundered down upon the blacks , and the Negroes broke and ran for the woods . The men galloped after them , firing . But Ross and Tom and Henry Montcliffe stayed where they were . Morgan again , Ross thought ironically , the legion of her lovers . . .  | Then the three of them rode down to the quarters , and commandeered the frightened blacks who cowered there , to put out the fire . Lance came out of the house with a musket in his hand and Morgan followed him with a carbine . " Many thanks , " he said quietly , and Ross saw the bleak misery in his eyes . " Have you captured them ? " " Not yet , " Henry Montcliffe said ; " but we will ! " Ross stood there , staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . It was , Ross knew , precisely the sort of thing that she would enjoy . Then the men were coming out of the woods dragging the Negroes behind them . " Had to shoot five more of the bastards before they 'd give up , " Charles Dahlgren growled . " Well , Lance  --  shall we get on with the hanging ? " " Well ? " Lance began ; but Morgan cut in sharply : " Yes ! Yes ! Hang them  --  the murderous beasts ! " They made a fire in the clearing , and the men went down to the stables and came back with ropes . " What about the rest of your niggers , " Henry Metcalfe asked : " they were n't in on this , were they ? " " No , " Lance said . " 1 think , " Morgan said sweetly , " maybe they 'd all better be given a whipping to teach them a lesson , just in case ... " " Good idea , " Dahlgren began ; but Lance cut him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have a one of my good people touched ! Do you realize , Charlie , that if they 'd joined in this , we would n't have been alive when you got here ? " " That 's true , " Dahlgren grumbled , " still . . " Still , " Lance said quietly , " I 'll hold any man personally responsible who touches a hair of their kinky heads . " Ross turned away from Morgan , cold and sick with disgust Then something in the appearance of one of the captured blacks caught his attention . Pedro ! Mother of God , why did he have to get mixed up in this ? Then he saw the reason . One of the rebellious Negroes was Bessie . Ross walked over to where Pedro lay , his hands tied behind him , his face bloody .  | " Why did you do it ? " he groaned ; " Mother of God , Pedro ? why ? " Pedro grinned at him . " There was this of the beatings , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave . Maria Santissima , but the white woman is formidable ! " " I 'll see what I can do , " Ross said . " And for my Bessie also ? " Pedro begged ; " for her even if not for me .. . . " Ross walked over to Lance . " One of those blacks , " he said , " is a free Cuban Negro who once saved my life . I wonder if . . . " No ! " Morgan said . Lance looked at her tiredly . " Sorry , Ross , " he said slowly ; " I wish I could . But these men would n't understand . It might cost us both their friendship ; and we 're going to need that damned soon , or I miss my guess ... " " All right , " Dahlgren said ; ' " string them up . " Ross watched the hangings . The eleven Negroes died in different ways , most of them very badly , begging and praying for life . But Pedro and Bessie stood up proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " were the ringleaders . They were lovers . Hang them together , wo n't you ? " The men grinned at her . This wife of Brittany 's sure Lord had spunk . Most of the women they knew would have been stretched out in a cold faint by now . They pushed Bessie and Pedro under the tree and dropped the noose around their necks . Something in their bearing must have moved Lance . Turning to George , he muttered : " See if they 've got anything to say .... " " No , Senores , nothing , " Pedro said easily when the question was put to him ; but Bessie 's dark eyes flashed in the firelight . " Yes ! " she cried ; " sure Lord I is got something to say ! Want to tell you gentlemens why I done it ! Because of her  --  because that wicked woman right there ! Know I 'm going to die  --  so I 'm telling the truth . Never thought of fighting  --  never even thought of being free till she come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause I done her hair wrong . She kicked me down the stairs ' cause I was a little slow . And gentlemens  --  I ask you one  | favor  --  just you go up in the attic and see what you 'll see . Even Marse Lance do n't know about that  --  that place what she had made where she could chain us to the floor and beat us  --  not ' cause we done nothing , but ' cause it pleasured her to beat us ! See the fancy door she made to lock us in ! " Go and look at that ! And see the bloody stains on the floor . Go out behind the barn and dig up the bones of old Lucas what she done whipped to death one night when Marse Pary did n't come over to sleep with her while Marse Lance was gone .... Ross 's breath stopped in his lungs , and in the little pause al ! sounds were curiously magnified . He thought he could pick out the note of each man 's breathing . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marse Lance ? ' cause I 'm going to die . Dying folks speaks true . Going to swear on it , before the Living God ? ' cause you been good to us  --  only she been meaner'n hell ! Marse Lance  --  ever ' time you spent any time out of this here house , she had some other man in it ! Mostly it were that Marse Pary  --  more him than anybody else . But she done shamed you , Marse Lance  --  she done shamed you a thousand times ! " Ross , who was watching Morgan , recognized the precise instant she lost control . She jerked the carbine up and fired ; but Lance 's heavy hand caught the barrel so that the bullet plowed up a furrow of earth at Bessie 's feet . " Hang her ! " Morgan shrieked ; " hang the lying black bitch ! " " Yes , " Bessie said contemptuously ; " hang me now , gentlemens ; I done had my say . " The ropes jerked , tightened , and the two dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , their toes swinging slowly through half the points of the compass ; but nobody looked at them . They were looking at Lance Brittany . They were watching the spectacle of a man 's spirit crumpling quite visibly behind the walls of his flesh . Then , with an effort , Lance mastered himself . This is it , Ross thought bitterly , here he comes now , and tomorrow I 'll die my dishonored death . Tomorrow I 'll exchange shots with a man who has always befriended me , who has gone to trouble and expense to aid me , who has trusted me implicitly  | ? and I betrayed him . Maybe there is justice in the world , after all . How will it be tomorrow ? How will it be when I fire my pistol into the air and stand there waiting ? But suddenly all the hard-held breath left his lungs with a rush , for Lance had turned away from him and was marching stiffly , straight up to his brother , Tom . " Oh , no ! God , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back , and struck Tom hard across his face . Ross saw his brother stiffen . Then Tom straightened up , proudly . " Before all these gentlemen present , " he said in a deep voice , " and before the God I serve , I want to declare that I 'm innocent of these charges . But I 'll meet you , Mister Brittany  --  any time or place you say . " " The sandbar , " Lance got out ; " in front of Vidalia . The choice of weapons is yours , Mister Pary . " " Pistols , " Tom Pary said . Ross broke out of the trance in which he had held . He ran over to where Tom and Lance stood . " Lance , " he said ; " You 've got the wrong Pary . I 'm the guilty party , Lance  --  and I 'm as guilty as hell . " Lance stared at him with dull eyes . There was so much fatigue in his face . " Gallant as usual , eh Ross ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , he is your brother .... " " Nol " Ross cried ; " I 'm not lying , Lance  --  I 'm the guilty one , not Tom ! " " Sorry , Ross , " Lance said heavily ; " I wo n't fight you . I know what kind of relationship existed between you and Morgan . I have the right man all right . " " All she said was Pary ! " Ross wept ; " she did n't say which Pary . " " She did n't need to , " Lance said . " You 'll have to meet me ! " Ross raged ; " if you kill Tom , I 'll challenge you . Oh you stupid jackass , ca n't you see I 'm not lying ? " " No , " Lance said ; " I ca n't see it . And if you issue a challenge , I 'll refuse to accept it . " He turned slowly , and with massive dignity , to the other men .  | " Gentlemen , " he said gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my humblest apologies for the disgraceful scene that has transpired here . I assure you , that after this  --  the Brittanys will trouble Natchez no more . I would not have you reminded of the shame of my dishonored house , or have your ladies disturbed by the presence of one who has disgraced all Southern womanhood . And now , gentlemen  --  good night ! " Only a few of them answered him . In a way , they shared his shame . For a while hereafter the wives of Natchez would be troubled by much suspicious questioning . Henry Montcliffe , moved over to Lance , his face filled with concern . " Go light on her , wo n't you , Lance ? " he whispered . Lance glared at him . " Go light ! " he said ; " If she 's alive tomorrow  --  it will be because my arm has grown too tired . Good night , sir ! " Morgan turned her gaze in Ross 's direction . Her black eyes were filled with terror . " Ross ! " she gasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Ross looked at her . " God give his arm strength ! " he said . The river , moving , made a little peaceful sound as it washed against the sandbar . Ross Pary turned his head toward Natchez , already bright with sun because of the height upon which it sat . But here upon the sandbar before Vidalia , the light was still gray with morning mist . Doctor Benbow knelt a little apart , examining his instruments . A little distance apart , Lance Brittany stood silently beside Charles Dahlgren , his second . Both banks were lined with spectators , armed with telescopes ; and the river was filled with skiffs , loaded to the gunwales with men come to see the slaughter . The Judge stood up now , beckoning to the two men to come together . Ross heard his instructions only vaguely : " Thirty paces  --  fire upon the count of three  --  any man firing prematurely to be shot by his seconds  --  duel can be terminated now by an apology given  --  or by mutual agreement . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same conditions p 300 if no one is wounded . In the case of a non-fatal wound , the victor can declare his honor satisfied upon first blood . If he does not so declare , the duel must continue . Now shake hands and go to your places . And may God have mercy on your souls ! " Ross 's eyes were red from lack of sleep . He had spent all of the remaining hours of the previous night , arguing with Tom , begging him to refuse to fight , pointing out that he had a wife and children , and that he was innocent . " In a way I am , " Tom had drawled . " In another I ai n't . I never had nothing serious to do with her , but it sure Lord was n't because I did n't try . Besides , Lance slapped my face in front of all those men . You want me to play the coward ? " Against such invincible stupidity , Ross was helpless . There was nothing more he could do . If his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed , Ross could only avenge him ; that was all . Even that was not so simple as it looked . Avenge him against whom ? Certainly Morgan was much more at fault in this matter than Lance  --  and he , himself , was perhaps the most at fault of all . If Tom died , who among them had murdered him ? The hand that pulled the trigger ? The woman who had tempted him with her body until he found himself standing almost guiltless in this fatal place ? Or Ross Pary , his brother , who had done the thing for which now , he must die ? The two men were standing facing each other now . The judge began his counting . " One ! " Ross 's hand tightened upon the butt of his own pistol . What if he were to fire ? As a second , he could shoot only under a violation of the conditions laid down . They would hang him for murder  --  but what mattered that if he saved Tom ? " Two ! " But Lance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could n't kill Lance  --  he could n't . . . " Thr ? " The two shots made one sound . Ross saw Lance reel . A patch of red blossomed high upon his left shoulder . Tom still stood there , unmoving . Ross raced over to him ; but while he was still yards away , Tom 's knees buckled very slowly , and he pitched forward on his face in the sand . Ross threw himself down beside him and lifted his head into  | his lap . Tom opened his mouth to say something , but he never got it out , for his words were drowned in a rush of blood . The ball had gone through his lungs , and he was drowning . He lay upon Ross 's lap , coughing up blood in clots , his big , handsome face turning blue . It took him a long time to die , for he was a man of great strength . Ross eased his inert head back down upon the sand and stood up . His own clothing was drenched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , too , he thought ; and I shall never be clean . . . Then in one wild rush , he started toward Lance . But Dahlgren and Doctor Benbow bore him down . He struggled with them so fiercely , shrieking with rage , that Charles Dahlgren finally brought the barrel of his pistol down across his head . Lance stood there staring at his inert form . " Poor devil , " he murmured . " He was my friend . But this finishes that . In a way it finishes me , too . . . . He looked past Ross to where Tom lay , sprawled out in one of those postures that have no counterpart in life , and shuddered . " Well , gentlemen , " he said quietly , " shall we go ? " When Ross regained consciousness he found himself on his own bed at Moonrise , and someone was bathing his face . Then his eyes cleared and he saw his sister , Annis , sitting there beside him . bathing his face and crying . " Jennie ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Annis said . " Flow is she taking it ? " Ross said . " Hard . She has n't cried . Oh , Ross , what an awful thing it is not to be able to cry . " Ross struggled to sit up . But the room reeled drunkenly , and sledge hammers started pounding inside his head . He kept trying it until at last he was upright , and then Jennie came into the room and put her hand on his chest and pushed him down again . " No , " she said ; " no more killing , Ross . " " But ? " Ross began . The only one who should die for this , " Jennie said in a low voice , " is Morgan , Ross . And she will die  --  but not by your hand . I wo n't have that . She 'll die in the fullness of time  --  by the hand of God . . . . " She stared past him , out the window . " And it will be terrible dying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | that she will beg for death long before it comes to her . But you must n't challenge Lance . Promise me that , Ross . Promise met " " All right , " Ross said ; " I promise . " " Try to rest , Ross . Doctor Benbow thinks you might have a slight concussion . " " So ? " Ross said ; " you think I should care about that ? " " Yes . You 're not a coward . Death is so easy , Ross . It would be ever so much easier for me . But there are the children . So I must live . And you , too , Ross  --  for they 're your flesh and blood , too . They must have some future . " " Yes , " Ross whispered ; " they must . " He lay upon the bed looking at her , and he saw that her eyes were dead and her face was terrible . She got up very quietly and left the room . Ross turned to Annis . " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't leave her alone . I 'll be all right . " After Annis had gone , he lay upon the bed and tried to think . But his head ached damnably . He slipped after a time into a curious somnolence  --  a state halfway between sleep and wakefulness . When he roused himself again , it was night . He sat up in the bed . His head ached dully , but the room no longer reeled . When he tried it , he found that he could stand . He dressed quickly and went down the back stairs and out into the stable and saddled Nancy . Then he started riding toward Finiterre . She has lived long enough , he thought . Jennie is right  --  riot Lance . Lance was the tool of circumstances ; the unwitting instrument of the fates . But Morgan did this thing  --  with my help . With the help of my weakness , my cowardice , my lack of will . My part in it wo n't go unpunished , because it will take its end from this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction to the winds and reaping her deadly harvests . Lance wo n't be here tonight . After this morning he will be in need of comforting . He 'll go to Connelly 's . Only I will be here  --  and Morgan and that will be enough . As he rode through the high gate , he noticed that the splintered top bar had neither been repaired or replaced . That was indicative of something . When a man like Lance began to neglect his home , something had gone out of him .  | He got down from the horse and tied her to the hitching rail . Then he went up the curving stairs to the gallery and into the house where no servant waited and there was no sound . He moved surely up the stairway to Morgan 's bedroom , and just before he reached it , he heard her whimpering . He pushed open the door , and looked into her eyes . They were the eyes of an animal , senseless and glaring . She had a lock of her thick , black hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slowly . Ross moved over to where she lay across the bed , and when he was close he saw that the back of her dress was lashed into ribbons and sticking to her . But she did n't say anything . She lay there chewing the lock of her hair , and whimpering . Ross backed away from her , toward the door . The Hand of God , Jennie had said . This was a strange thing . God was seldom so prompt in dealing with the affairs of men ... . As he went down the stairs again he was conscious of a feeling of relief . What he had meant to do , he would have done more in sorrow than in anger  --  neither out of hatred nor of vengefulness ; but because he was convinced of its necessity and now it seemed no longer necessary . The next three days were the ones that he tried afterwards not to remember . They were days of silence and of sad preparations . But they were over finally , and the burial ground at Moonrise held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , with David Martin and Ross supporting Jennie between them , when they saw a Negro riding toward them at a hard gallop . Ross did n't know the man ; but he did know the horse he rode ; it was Satana , Morgan 's black mare . The man pulled the mare up as he came up to them and took off his ragged hat . " Marse Ross , " he quavered ; " Miz Morgan say you come right now ! There 's been a accident . . . They all stood still , staring at the black . Even Jennie stopped her helpless crying .  | An accident ? " Ross had a premonition . " What kind of an accident ? " " Marse Lance , suh . He tried to jump that there high gate agin  --  and Prince did n't make it . Reckon he dead , suh . " Jennie 's fingers tightened convulsively upon Ross 's arm . " She killed him ! " she moaned . " Oh , Ross  --  she 's killed him tool " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always jumping Prince over that gate . And it was too high . I saw him miss breaking his neck by inches not so long ago , myself . Reckon Lance got careless  --  or he was overwrought . All right , " he said to the Negro , " tell your Mistress I 'm coming . " He did not push Nancy on the way . There was no hurry now . Whether he arrived late or soon would not help Lance Brittany . He wondered if subconsciously Lance had not pulled Prince up too soon , or held him back a little too hard . After the duel , there had been a death wish in Lance 's eyes . A man like Lance did not kill himself knowingly ; but he might easily become dangerously careless when life no longer mattered . . . . He rode through the broken gate without half looking at it . The top bar was shattered and the one below that was splintered a little ; he saw that without looking at the gate but these details were meaningless to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules to Prince 's broken carcass , getting ready to drag it away . He went up the stairs and into the hall . The doors of the dining room were open and he could see Morgan standing there , beside a blanket-wrapped object on the table . She was neatly dressed and her hair was combed and her eyes were cool and steady and absolutely griefless . Ross came into the dining room and walked past her and stood looking down at the covered body of Lance Brittany . Then he put out his hand and drew the blanket off his face and looked at it . Lance 's face was serene and quiet . He looked singularly peaceful . Even his eyes were closed . Were it not for the dreadful angle that his head tilted toward his left shoulder , it might have been possible to believe he slept . Ross turned toward Morgan , his gaze filled with speculation . Her eyes , he saw , were utterly peaceful , and on her face was a deep and quiet smile .  | " Now , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ross . Now you will marry me and we 'll live here at Finiterre and be the happiest two people in the world . .. . Then , going up on tiptoe , she kissed his mouth . His hands came up and gripped her shoulders and hurled lu.t away from him . She struck the table so hard that only the weight of Lance 's massive body prevented it from turning over . She lay back against it and the trapped animal look was bark in her eyes . But only for a moment . Then they cleared . " Ross , " she whispered , " Ross . . . Ross stared at her . He was trembling . He had felt like this Dinh once before and that was the time they had come upon the bodies of their companions in Cuba , spread-eagled upright between posts with their bellies ripped open . The sickness was down inside of him so deep that he regretted momentarily that he could not die of it . He opened his mouth to scream at her , to call her  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not pale and colorless against the actuality of Morgan . She came up from against the table and stood there looking at him , and Ross could see that her mouth was moist and parted , and that she was beginning to pant a little like a feline shething , and the sickness curled itself into a knot at the pit of his stomach and stopped his breath . But he rammed his will downward out of the core of his heart into the nerves and muscles of his limbs and whirled away from her silently and marched out of the room and did not stop until he came to the place where his mare waited . He mounted her and rode away from the house toward the twelve-barred gate that had cost Lance Brittany his life . He did not know what made him stop and look at it . He had the feeling that something was wrong with it , something he could discover if he used his eyes . But he could not see it . The top bar was broken on the left , precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low in jumping would have struck it . Beneath it , on the bar below the top one , a yard-long splinter had been gouged out . That was all . But he could n't shake the feeling that something was wrong with that gate ; something he knew , something he had seen before . He turned Nancy away from it and headed back toward Moon-  | rise . And when he had ridden five hundred yards , it came to him . He yanked the mare around and came back toward the gate at a gallop . Just before he reached it , he pulled her up , hard . The splintered planking of the topmost bar had the bright , clean yellow coloring of freshly broken wood . But the piece gouged out of the second bar was old . The broken place had weathered and turned brown from months of exposure to sun and rain . It had been knocked out of the bar months ago , almost a year ago , for he , himself , had seen it when it happened . Why , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negroes used the old planking when they repaired the gate ? What sense was there in shifting this board downward to a lower position , when the bar below it had been untouched ? His mind worked slowly , raggedly . To do that , they would have had to throw away a perfectly good bar , or change the places of the two bars so that the top one was intact while the second one was broken . Even so , it did n't make sense ; and Lance would n't have permitted it . There was enough already cut and seasoned lumber on the grounds to build a house , let alone replace a broken gate bar . Then quite suddenly , and with dreadful certainty , he knew what the Negroes had done  --  and at whose orders they had done it . All he had to do now to prove his thought was to count the bars . But he could n't bring himself to do it . The broken place on the second bar was old . And Prince had carried his left forefoot low in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars at once . The second bar had been the top bar , and looking at it now , Ross Pary could see that the nails that held it in place were rusted . They had not been removed . The broken top bar had not been removed . All they had done was to  --  He started counting : " One , two , three , four , five ? " It must be ; it would be like her to think of this . " Six , seven , eight , nine , ten ? " I ca n't . It would be too much ? enormously too much . " Eleven , twelve  --  thirteen . " Thirteen bars on a twelve-barred gate . Another bar  --  eight inches higher than the space that Prince had been able to clear at the top of his jumping form . Coming up to the gate at a gallop , Lance Brittany had n't had time to count the bars . There was no reason why he should have thought of counting the bars since he was not the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There it was . It was out now . Thirteen bars on a twelve-barred gate . And Morgan Brittany had murdered her husband . He sat there on Nancy , cold and sick with helpless rage . There it was , and there was absolutely nothing he could do about it . He knew that he should go to the authorities , though the chance of their believing him in a case like this was slight . He , himself , with his brother dead at Lance 's hands , would have a much better motive in their eyes for killing Lance than Morgan did . But it was not that which deterred him . It was rather , the belief that he should have disposed of Morgan himself , long ago  --  that as the unwilling partner in her crimes , he should have been the agent of just retribution . And he had muffed the chance . Now he would not do it  --  because he could not ... . He rode back toward Moonrise through a world turned gray , gone dead , where even the branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They seemed to pluck at him with ghostly hands . And the rising wind mocked him . " Coward ! " it shrieked . " Fool and coward ! " When he got back to Moonrise , he called Simon and Wallace and ordered them to pack his things  --  all his things  --  enough for a long journey . Annis came into his room before they had finished , and stood there watching them . " You 're going away , " she said . " Yes . " " For how long , Ross ? " " I do n't know , " Ross said . " Maybe a year  --  maybe forever . " Annis looked at him , and her blue eyes misted over . " What will we do , Ross ? " she said tremulously ; " what will we do without you ? " " David can take care of the place , " Ross said ; " and you 'll be married to your Danton in another month . " " No , " Annis said ; " not in another mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now  --  out of respect for Tom . Danton wo n't like it ; but I ca n't marry him now  --  I ca n't ! " " I see , " Ross murmured . " I think he 'll understand . He appears to be the right sort . " " You 'll write us , Ross ? " " No , " Ross said .  | " No ? " Annis echoed . " Why not ? " Ross looked at her . " I want to forget this place , " he said heavily ; " at least for a while . I want to make my heart whole again with other places ? other scenes . Time dulls the edge of everything , Annis . When I can  --  if I can , I shall come back again . When I 've made up my mind about that  --  whether I shall return or not , I 'll write you . Do n't worry , Annis  --  I 'm going to be all right . " " I think you will , " Annis said tensely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So it was that once again Ross Pary left the land of his fathers . He wandered for a year . He lived for varied periods of time in New York , Philadelphia , and Boston . By the end of that year , some of the pain had gone out of him ; the twisted skeins of terror and shame and hurt had loosened their tentacles from around the walls of his heart , leaving him free to breathe again , to feel ... . But what was left was emptiness , and a loneliness so great it filled his world . He endured it for some months longer ; then he embarked upon a coastal steamer and got off a few days later at Key West . Cathy Linton saw him coming up the path to her uncle 's house and waited breathlessly for his approach . Then , when he was close , and she could see his face , certainty burst upon her like a great light , and she ran down the stairs , straight into his arms .  | Chapter 17 THEY RODE in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Place de la Concorde . Then they swung halfway around the square and turned into the Rue de Rivoli by the Tuileries . The Louvre lay some distance beyond , shaped like the letter Y with an arch between the prongs . " Let 's get out here , " Cathy said ; " I want to walk under the trees . " " All right , " Ross said . He paid the driver and they got down . Then they started to walk under the chestnut trees in the Tuileries . It was late in the fall of 1857 , and the air was silver gray . An old man sat on one of the benches , feeding the squirrels . The pigeons arched far out over the Place de la Concorde , banking together in the same smooth circle above the spire and across the Seine , then back over the Tuileries again . " I can get tickets for the Opera tonight , " Ross said . " Would you like to go there ? " " No , " Cathy said miserably , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ross said . " To Key West ? " " No ! To your Moonrise , silly ! I 'm sick of all this .... " " Do n't you like Paris ? " Ross said . " No  --  everybody speaks French to me . Even you forget and do it sometimes . It 's been a nice long honeymoon , darling  --  but it 's lasted too long to my way of thinking . I 'm tired of being a bride , Ross . I 'd like to start being a wife . I 'd like to manage your house and  --  and have a baby . Why have n't we had a baby , Ross ? We 've  | been married almost two years now . In three more months it will be two years . Why have n't we ? " " God knows , " Ross said . He looked at Cathy . She was dressed in a black plush pelisse with beaver fur at the cuffs and around the hem . The fur went straight across the bodice above the breasts and over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it met in a vee . Cathy 's little black hat had ostrich tips , and was tied under her chin with a bow of green ribbon . Her dress was of green silk with lingerie collar and cuffs . On Cathy , the whole effect was very fetching . She was one of those women designed by nature to wear handsome clothes . The couturieres delighted to see her enter their shops . Not only was Ross generous with her to a fault ; she was a walking advertisement for their wares . Many another wealthy English or American woman was moved to ask her where she bought her clothes . Any shop that Cathy Pary frequented was sure to notice thereafter , a considerable increase in trade . There were many women in Paris much more beautiful than Cathy ; but their very beauty tended to divert attention from the clothes they wore . Cathy 's stark , exciting face , and the thin figure that the matchless cuisine of Paris had been able to add only a few pounds to , caught the eye and made it linger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all commonplace  --  but you never forget a face like Cathy 's . It 's not pretty ; but it 's anything but plain . It 's so damned alive . Cathy smiled at him , and let her gloved hand rest lightly upon his arrn . When she smiled , the freckles on her nose crinkled delightfully . " Ca n't we go home , Ross ? " she teased ; " ca n't we ? " Ross frowned . Go home , Back to Moonrise standing on the bluff above the river under the oaks . Back to the smell of the camellias , and the roads that were like tunnels of green lace under the overhanging boughs . Back to the sweep of blue sky and rolling field , and the dark voices singing in the sun . Back to where Finiterre brooded white and ghostly above the river . Back to where Morgan is  --  Morgan the terrible , who can twist a man 's soul between the palms of her hands . . . . He felt something moving just below his heart  --  something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much he missed his home ? how much he wanted and needed to be there . Besides , there was a job to be done : now that Tom was dead , he could free his slaves . He could move the burden of that particular guilt from his vastly overburdened soul . Hang Morgan , anyhow ! Ever since that day nearly eight years ago that she had stood there laughing in the sunlight while the river rats beat him to a bloody hulk , she had had entirely too much influence upon his life  --  all of it bad . He smiled suddenly , joyously . " Yes , Cathy , " he said ; " yes  --  we 'll go home ! " Then Cathy kissed him . They dined that night at a cafe in Montmartre , savoring their last night in Paris . Across the street from where they sat under the elms on the sidewalk , facing each other across the little table , there was a theatre . Ross could read the signs on the billboards from where he sat . " La Habanera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the World ! " There was even a painting of La Habaiiera . In the dim glow of the street lights , it looked vaguely familiar . Cathy followed his gaze . " Would you like to see her ? " she asked . " No , " Ross said quickly . " No , Cathy , I would n't . " " All right , " Cathy said . " Let 's just sit here . It 's ever so much nicer to sit here alone together . " " Yes , " Ross said ; " it is . " He was glad that Cathy did not ask him why he did n't want to see the Spanish dancer . The memory of Conchita was a dull ache now , buried under the passing years . He did n't want it awakened . It would do no good to revive it now . If they went into that theatre there would be the swift , fiery beat of Spanish music again ; there would be the patterned thunder of flamencos , and it would all come back again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the memory of the perfect legs in the swirl of skirts launching the classic grand jetd in a wild Cuban clearing ; the sound of Pedro 's serenade on the three-stringed guitar . No , it was far better like this . They sat there a long time after supper , holding hands across the table and looking into each other 's eyes . And after a while the  | " What do you want to talk to all these men for ? " Cathy complained ; " I want to go home . " " Business , " Ross said . " But you have your own business , and your plantation . I do n't see .. " Do n't worry your little head about it , " Ross said . " But I have to , " Cathy said , the color flaming in her cheeks . " What concerns you concerns me . The way it looks to me is that you 're planning to move up here ! " " I am , " Ross said . Cathy 's gray eyes opened wide . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of her mouth . " You  --  you 'd live up here among all these Yankees  --  after all that 's happened ? " she asked in astonishment . " I 'm afraid we 're going to have to , Cathy , " Ross said gravely . " I 'm going to be mighty unpopular in Natchez when I get through freeing my slaves ... " Cathy 's breath came out in a rush , audibly . " You 're going to turn your niggers loose ? " she said . " Yes , Cathy . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand .... " Ross came over to her and took her hands . He looked into her eyes sadly . " Twice in Cuba , " he said , " black men saved my life . While I was there , I was captured and beaten with a whip  --  the way we sometimes beat Negroes . I was held like a slave  --  kept in order to furnish music for my  --  owners . So I know the other side of it , Cathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has any right to own another man , like a horse . " Cathy snatched her hands downward and away from his grip . " You do this and I 'll leave you ! " she said ; " I wo n't be married to a man who 's a traitor to the South ! " " Look , Cathy , " Ross said gently ; " I 'm an American . I do n't belong to any section  --  North , South , East , or West . And I think that slaveholding shames our whole nation . I think it 's an outRoss and Cathy reached New York City in January of 1858 , and lingered there for two months while Ross talked to the heads of various architectural firms .  | doors of the theatre across the street opened and the crowd poured out of it . " My God , it 's late ! " Ross said ; " we 'd better get back to the hotel and get some sleep  --  we 're catching the early train for Cherbourg . " " A little longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so nice here .... They sat there a little longer , and the street grew quiet again . Finally , regretfully , Ross stood up , and touched Cathy 's arm . She stood up too and they walked to the edge of the sidewalk , and Ross lifted his cane to summon a cab . One of them turned toward them , the ancient horse slow-clopping toward the curb . Ross opened the door , and took Cathy 's arm . And it was at that moment that the Spanish dancer , La Habanera , came out of the theatre on the arm of Raoul Bergson , her manager , and saw him . She stopped dead , her long fingers gripping his arm . " What ails you , darling ? " the manager said . " Have you gone mad ? " " That man ! That man ! Oh Raoul ! I could swear " You could swear what ? " Bergson said gruffly . Across the street Ross Pary lifted his head . " No , " she whispered ; " the face is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still in spite of that he looks like him ! Enos inously ! " Like whom ? " Bergson said tiredly . " Like a man I knew once  --  in Cuba . A man I was once in love with . The only man in truth that I have ever really loved .... " " There have been enough of them since , darling , " Bergson said . " Come on  --  you must rest . Tomorrow we go to Marseilles .... " The cabriolet bearing Ross Pary and his bride clopped off in the direction of the right bank . The dancer stood there staring after it . " Could we not follow them , Raoul ? " she said insistently ; " perhaps they go to a hotel and I could discover ... " " No , " Bergson was brusque . " This is a great folly . Ma foi , but you have strange whims .... " moded barbarism without any moral justification whatsoever . " Cathy looked at him . Then , suddenly , she began to cry . " I thought I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ! You 're as  | bad as that old John Brown who killed all those people out in Missouri ! " " We gentlemanly Southerners killed a few , ourselves , " Ross said drily . " It was way back in ' fifty-five that five thousand Southerners invaded Kansas and took over the polls . And , if I remember correctly , it was May twenty-fifth of ' fifty-six that John Brown and his men killed those five slavery men at Pottawatomie Creek ? four days after we chivalrous Southerners had burned the free soil capitol of Lawrence to the ground  --  the same day that another Southern gentleman beat a small and frail Massachusetts Congressman almost to death with a gutta percha cane . Or maybe you approve of Bully Brooks ? " " Oh , I hate you ! " Cathy sobbed . " Damn your ornery hide , I hate you ! " Ross came up to her and put his arms about her . " It 's not our quarrel , Cathy , " he murmured . " I love you  --  and things will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And there 's going to be a war . Then which side will you be on , Ross Pary ? " Ross sighed heavily . " I 'm sorry you asked me that , " he said . " Truthfully , Cathy , I 'll be on the side that holds all men free and equal under God . I hope I can get you to see things my way before that happens . God knows I hope so .... " " Never ! " Cathy said . They reached Natchez in June , after a lengthy stay with Harry Linton in Key West , and two full weeks in New Orleans . Ross had been in no real hurry to get home . He started walking with Cathy up Silver Street , hoping to find a public conveyance to take them out to Moonrise once they had reached the upper town . But , before he was able to find any kind of a hack , he saw Henry Montcliffe driving toward then in a smart , two-handed rig . " Ross ! " Henry cried . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look fine ! " He turned his gaze upon Cathy , and his dark eyes sparkled . Cathy looked at him , and in spite of herself , she smiled . This  | one sure is handsome , she thought . Good-looking as Ross used to be before his nose was broken  --  no , better-looking . Good bit of the devil in those eyes , too ... . " Who 's the lady , Ross ? " Henry said . " My wife , " Ross told him . " Cathy , may I present my friend , Henry Montcliffe ? " " Mighty proud to make your acquaintance , ma'am , " Henry said . His voice at the moment , had a certain warmth to it . Nice little creature , he was thinking . Sort of homely  --  but nice . Slim ? lines like a racing filly 's . The only trouble with the whole damned thing is that Ross hangs around home too much . But the smile upon his face when he turned to Ross was candid and clear . " Can I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'd be mighty obliged , " Ross said ; " but we 're going way out to Moonrise , and that 's a pretty fair sized trip . " " Think I 'd let a little thing like that stop me ? " Henry grinned . " Where are your valises ? You must have some . " " I left them at the sawmill , " Ross told him . " Figured they 'd be safe there . It was a mite too hot to lug them all the way up Silver Street . " " All right , then , " Henry said ; " we 'll drive down there and pick them up first . " " Do n't bother , " Ross said . " You 're doing enough for us now , Henry . Besides , there are trunks , too  --  so I have to send a wagon out from Moonrise for them anyhow . " " Tell you what , " Henry said ; " we 'll pick up the valises  --  you 'll need them right away . Then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll send some of my niggers after your trunks . That way , they 'll be at Moonrise a heck of a lot quicker . " " Now really , Henry ... " " Do n't mention it , Ross ; do n't you say a word . Glad to do it . " He 's nice , Cathy thought . He really is nice . And so handsome , too . I hope he comes to visit us sometime . " Do you ever come out to Moonrise , Mister Montcliffe ? " she asked him . " Well I have n't very much before , " Henry laughed ; " but I 'm going to now . Got to solve the mystery .... " " What mystery ? " Cathy asked .  | " How come a sweet little girl like you went and married this mashed-faced scoundrel , " Henry said . " And when you 've solved it ? " Ross asked lightly . " I do n't know , " Henry said . " Reckon I 'll try to steal her for myself  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Could I persuade you to leave old broken nose ? " Cathy looked at Ross , and a dangerous glint showed in her gray eyes . " Reckon maybe I could , " she said quietly , " if he does n't behave better than he has these last few months .... " " Fine ! " Henry laughed ; " I 'll start working at it right away ! " There was , Ross thought , an undertone in all this jesting that he did n't like . It cut perilously close to truth . And if ordinarily he held husbandly jealousy an unworthy trait , insulting to his wife , and demeaning to himself , he could not deny that the relationship between himself and Cathy had been showing signs of strain for a long time . The root of it was the fact that he did not love Cathy  --  a state of affairs difficult to cox ceal from any woman , and quite impossible to hide from anyone as intelligent as Cathy . More than one accidental remark of his , he suspected , had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to walk carefully ... . It came to him then that this , too , had n't worked out right ? that so little in a man 's life ever did work out right . Who was to blame for that ? Men who marshaled their affairs so stupidly , or the God who withheld from them the wit to arrange things better ? " What on earth are you thinking about ? " Cathy said . " You have n't said a word for miles . " " God , " Ross said . Henry Montcliffe lifted his hand , and pointed his index finger at his temple , moving it about in a cirde in the age-old symbol for insanity . Cathy smiled at him . " Sometimes I agree with you , " she said . Then they were rolling up the drive toward Moonrise and Jennie was standing on the gallery waiting for them . Ross was surprised and pleased at how well kept the plantation looked . Apparently David Martin , the overseer , had done his work with uncommon thoroughness . They came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarmed about the rig , crying greetings , and reaching up to take the baggage . Ross kissed the cheek Jennie offered him , and turned to Cathy . " This is Jennie , Cathy , " he said . " Welcome home , Cathy , " Jennie said softly , and took the slim girl in her arms . " Where are the twins ? " Cathy said ; " I 'm just dying to see them ! " " Upstairs . Come on in . You , too , Henry  --  if you like . " " No 'm , " Henry smiled . " Reckon I 'll be getting along back to Laurel Hill . Be seeing y'all .... " " ' Bye , " Cathy said , and put out her small , freckled hand . " It was nice meeting you .... " " The pleasure was all mine , ma'am , " Henry said . " So long , Ross . I 'll be out to see you  --  some night when you ai n't at home ! " Then he turned the pair away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's charming , " Jennie said . " Yes , he is , " Cathy agreed . " He 's going to make a charming corpse , " Ross said grimly , " if he is n't careful ! " " Oh , you ! " Cathy laughed , and gave his arm an affectionate squeeze . They moved upstairs to the bedroom . Inside , little Peter and Annis were playing cheerfully upon the floor . It came as a shock to Ross to realize they were now almost seven years old . Cathy picked up little Annis , a blonde cherub , with chubby pink cheeks . She sat down , holding the child on her lap , and little Peter stopped his game of toy soldiers and climbed up beside her . Suddenly , helplessly , Cathy started to cry . " What 's the matter , dear ? " Jennie said . " I  --  I want a baby so much ! " Cathy sobbed ; " and it looks like we 'll never have any ! " " That 's the will of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me with these all you want to  --  and believe me , you 'll have your hands full ! " Ross turned sadly away from his wife , and , as he did so his gaze fell upon the night table beside Jennie 's bed . There was a pipe upon it  --  half full of tobacco ash . Jennie saw his astonished look and smiled .  | " David and I have been married a month , " she said . " It was better that way . The children needed a father . And with their uncle forever away from home they were getting a little undisciplined . I  --  I hope you approve , Ross . " " I do , " Ross said heavily , " Dave 's a fine man . There 's only one question in my mind , Jen  --  do you love him ? " " I respect him , " Jennie said . " It 's a great comfort to be married to a man who always comes home at night .... " " Still thinking of that , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ? " Jennie 's face was very still . " They are n't , " she said . " They are n't ? " Ross echoed blankly . " Why not , Jen ? " " They were never married . After you left  --  Morgan started conk ing here asking after you . I told her I had no news of you , but she kept coming  --  I 'm sorry , Cathy  --  you have no cause for concern . Ross never loved Morgan ; it was the other way around . , .. " " Thanks , Jen , " Ross said . " And I thank you , too , " Cathy said impishly ; " I do n't think he 'd look very pretty with his eyes scratched out on top of that broken nose ! " " Do n't mind her , " Ross said brusquely . " Tell me what happened .... " " She met Danton , of course . And you know Morgan . Danton is a very handsome boy ; she just had to have him on her string . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimly . " The funny part about it is I do n't think so . Danton came here afterwards and begged me to intercede for him with Ann is . He swore by the Virgin and on the honor of his mother that he was innocent . 1 believed him , Ross ; but Annis  --  did n't . She gave him back his ring and broke the engagement . He pleaded with her . He wrote her  --  he came again and again ; but Annis simply said : That woman killed my brother . She 's poisonous . I do n't want anything her lips have touched . ' " " She compromised him , " Ross said ; " she arranged something ? something that would look worse than it was .... " " Yes , " Jennie said . " Out of spite . Out of pure wickedness  --  because she wanted to hurt you , I reckon . " " And Annis ? " Ross said .  | " She 's upstairs in her room . She vowed she 'd never leave this house again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over two years .... " " You 'll excuse me , Cathy ? " Ross said ; and started for the door . " No , " Cathy said ; " I 'm coming with you . The poor thing ! What she needs is a woman to talk some sense into her head . " " It wo n't do any good , Cathy , " Jennie warned ; " I 've tried it myself . " The face of his sister shocked him . Annis had always been a very pretty girl , and now she was lovely . But the loveliness was not of this world . It was wan , dreamlike , ethereal . It was a spiritual loveliness , born of resignation  --  of acceptance . " Annis ? " Ross said . " Oh ! " Annis said . Then : " Ross  --  you 're back . I 'm glad . " But there was no gladness in her voice , nor surprise either . There was nothing in her voice . It was dead . By his side , Cathy stared at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look , Annis , " Ross began . " I know , " Annis said quickly ; " you 're going to tell me I 'm very foolish to stay here like this . You 're right . I am . " " Then why in the name of heaven ? " " Because I ca n't help it , " Annis said . " Why ca n't you help it ? " Cathy said . " Why ca n't you , Annis ? " Annis stared at her . " Who are you ? " she said . " Your sister-in-law . Ross 's wife . My name is Cathy . " " Cathy ? " Annis said . " Cathy . I like that . It 's a pretty name . " " Oh , God ! " Ross groaned . Annis smiled at him gently . " You think I 'm mad , do n't you , Ross ? You 're right . I am  --  a little . " " You ca n't do this , Annis ! " Ross said ; " You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely and ... " " I have to , Ross , " Annis said . " You see , he was never here . In this room I mean . He was everywhere else . We rode together all over the plantation and all through Natchez and most everywhere else around here . When I go out it reminds me . The trees remind me  --  the flowers , the river . Everything reminds me  --  so I ca n't go out . You see ? "  | " No , " Ross said gruffly ; " I do n't see . " " Oh , Ross , " Cathy whispered ; " take me out of here ! I 'm going to cry and I do n't want her to see it .... " " All right , " Ross said . " I 'll come back later to talk to you , Annis . " " Do , " Annis said . " ' Bye , Cathy . " " ' Bye ! " Cathy choked . Outside in the hall , she fell against Ross , sobbing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how could she ? What a terrible thing ! " " The woman who did this , " Ross said , " is terrible . Come now , we 'd better go down again . " They came down into the dining room where Jennie was fixing supper for them with the aid of several slaves . Just after they had sat down to supper , David Martin came into the house . He saw Ross sitting there , and his clean-cut face reddened with embarrassment . But Jennie got up and kissed him quickly . " It 's all right , dear , " she said ; " Ross knows  --  " " And approves , " Ross added , and put out his hand . David took it , grinning boyishly . " Thank you , sir ! " he said ; " I 'm mighty glad  --  that worried me a whole lot . Kind of reckoned you 'd think I 'd aimed too high ... . " The man who does n't aim high is the one who 's not worth his salt , " Ross said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin , formerly my associate  --  and now a member of the family ... . David , this is Cathy , my wife . " " Mighty happy to make your acquaintance , ma'am , " David said . " Your husband 's a fine man . Everybody hereabouts respects him . " " They wo n't any more , " Cathy said tartly , " if he does n't give up some of his foolish ideas . . . " They all looked at Ross inquiringly . " I did n't mean to bring it up so soon , " he said ; " but now that Cathy 's mentioned it , I might as well . Look David , would you and Jennie consider selling me the Negroes that Tom left you ? " Jennie looked at her husband then back at Ross . " He did n't leave us any , Ross , " she said . " He left everything  | to you with the provision that you 'd keep me and the children here as long as you were able to .... " " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplifies things  --  and in another way it does n't .... " " You 're planning to sell the place , sir ? " David asked . " If you are , I 've got a good idea . Last year the lumber mill made more money than the plantation . It 's going great guns . Now if you 'd let me buy into that , I 'd be mighty beholden to you . " " That does it ! " Ross said . " Heck , Dave  --  I 'll sign the mill over to you and Jen . And you can stay here at Moonrise  --  without working the place . I 'm going to sell most of the land except that right around the house anyhow . " Jennie stared at him . " Why , Ross ? " " Because , " Cathy said flatly , " he plans to set the niggers free . " Oddly enough , it was David who recovered first . " Well , sir , " he said , " you 're within your rights ; but you sure picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not within his rights , " Cathy said hotly ; " not now . To do such a thing would be giving aid and comfort to the enemy ! " Jennie looked at her and her mouth tightened . " A lot of great men have agreed with Ross about slavery , honey , " she drawled , " Thomas Jefferson , for one . He called it an insufferable crime , ' and freed his Negroes . George Washington directed that his be freed at the death of his wife or his daughter , I do n't remember which .. .. ' " I do n't believe it ! " Cathy said . " That 's always the refuge of those who do n't like to face facts , Cathy , " Ross said gently . Cathy stood up , her fingers gripping the tablecloth . " I do n't care ! " she cried . " Niggers were meant by God to be slaves ! And until He comes down to earth and tells me different , Himself , I wo n't believe it ! " Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You have got something on your hands , Ross ! " Jennie remarked drily . " I have , " Ross admitted ruefully , " I really have . " In a matter of weeks , he discovered exactly how much he did have on his hands ; for , when he applied to the courts for per-  | mission to free his blacks and transport them to Liberia , the storm that broke about his head was of a ferocity that even he had not anticipated . Men called at his house to argue , to threaten . His friends tried to point out to him the folly of the whole thing ; strangers , and mere acquaintances were openly abusive . Within the space of three weeks he received twenty-one challenges . He refused them all . The worst of it was the fact that Cathy would not speak to him at all  --  not even to make the simplest request . She added to his burdens by refusing to wear the riding dress he had bought her , and galloping about in one of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding astride like a man , with a little cigar stuck in her teeth to the great scandal of the whole countryside . The lower courts denied permission . The State law , they declared , clearly denied a man the right to free his Negroes under any conditions whatsoever . Ross called his Negroes up to the gallery of the house and told them the bad news . " What you gon na do now , Marse Ross ? " Brutus rumbled . " Gon na let them folks lick you  --  or you gon na fight ? " " I 'm going to fight , Brutus , " Ross said quietly . " This is the right thing  --  I 'm going to fight . " He took the case to the higher courts down in Jackson . And this , of course , had certain consequences . For while he was absent , Morgan returned after a long absence from Finiterre . She rode like a queen out to the house . And one of her first visitors was Henry Montcliffe . " Heard about Ross Pary ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell to free his niggers . The whole neighborhood is up in arms over it . Me'n ' Henry Metcalfe and Levin Marshall talked some of the boys out of riding over there and burning his house ? pointed out to them that Tom 's wife and kids had nothing to do with it , and they 'd be the ones to suffer most . " " That was sweet of you , " Morgan drawled ; " no , I had n't heard . I did n't even know he was back . " " Yep . Came back all right . Brought the cutest little filly with  | him I ever did see . Got the funniest-looking little face , freckled all over like a setter pup ? " " Big mouth . Chestnut hair . Thin .... " " How the devil did you know , Morg ? " " Cathy ? " Morgan whispered ; " Cathy Linton ! So he married her ! " And the fury was there now , in her black eyes . " Yep , " Henry grinned , " sure Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lil ' gal 's done given me the itch so bad .... " " The itch ? " Morgan said , looking at him narrowly , " what kind of an itch , Henry ? " " I want her , " Henry said huskily . " Goddamn my black soul to hell , I want her ! " " So ? " Morgan mused . " So little Cathy 's interesting , eh ? " " I 'll say she is ! You should see her  --  rides astride like a man , and can take jumps that nobody in his right mind would even attempt . She does it standing up in the stirrups with a little cigar stuck between her teeth . Brother ! I 'll bet she 'd burn a man up ! Damn her skinny little soul , she fair sets me wild .... " " Hmmmn , " Morgain said . Then suddenly , startlingly , she started to laugh . And the whole room rang with her laughter . Henry stared at her . " What 's got into you , Morg ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyhow . It 's just that I have a wonderful idea . Come here , Henry darling , and give me a kiss . " Henry grinned at her . " Sure thing , honey child ! " he said . " That , " Morgan said a few moments later , " was payment in advance . " " For what ? " Henry said . " For Ross Pary 's wife . I 'm going to give her to you , " Morgan said . Cathy woke up that morning , and stared at the empty place beside her . For Ross , as usual , was away at Jackson , fighting his case . " Damn him ! " she said aloud ; " Oh , damn him , damn him , damn him ! " Looking out of the window , she saw that it was late  --  much  | later than she usually awakened , so she dressed hurriedly and went downstairs into the dining room . She ate her skimpy breakfast alone , for the Martins had long since had theirs . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going to do . " Oh , heck ! " she said fretfully , " reckon I 'll go riding again ... " But as she turned to go back into the house and change into her mannish riding habit , she saw someone coming up the drive . She waited quietly , and when the rider was close , she saw that it was a woman . The most beautiful woman , she was certain , that she had ever seen in all her life . " How do you do ? " the woman said . Her voice , Cathy noted , was low , rich , thrilling . " You must be Cathy ... . " I am , " Cathy said . " Who are you ? " " Morgan . " " Ohl " Cathy said . " I can see you 've heard of me , " Morgan laughed . Her laugh was as clear as spring water , as unsullied as a child 's . " Terrible things , no doubt ? " " Yes , " Cathy said ; " terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Morgan swung down from Satana . " Why do you ask that ? " she murmured . " Because looking at you , I do n't believe them , " Cathy said . " You do n't look like a wicked woman . " Morgan slipped a firm arm about Cathy 's waist and leaning forward , kissed her cheek . " Thank you for that , Cathy , dear , " she said . " It 's sweet of you . " " Are they ? " Cathy demanded . " Why yes , " Morgan smiled , " as a matter of fact , they are . I 'm just as wicked as people say I am . No  --  wickeder . " " Well I 'll be damned ! " Cathy said helplessly . " You 're a charming girl , " Morgan said . " We 're going to be great friends , are n't we , Cathy ? " Suddenly , impulsively , Cathy smiled at her . " Why , yes we are , " she said . " Damned if I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I ca n't , " Morgan said ; " I have only a minute . I rode over  | to invite you over to my place tonight . I know Ross is n't here , and you must get lonely . " " I do , " Cathy said . " Then you 'll come ? " " Yes , " Cathy said , " I 'll come . " " Do n't tell Jennie . She does n't approve of me . Just say you 're going riding . ' Bye now . " " ' Bye , Morgan , " Cathy said . That night , out at Finiterre , Cato admitted her with a profound bow . " Miz Morgan say you come upstairs , " he said ; " she in her bedroom . " Cathy dimbed the stairs , and stood looking at the doors ; then Morgan came out of one of them and took her arm . " Come in , Cathy ! " she said . " Oh , I 'm so glad to see you . Sit down  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge , bell-shaped affairs . They 'd hold a mighty heap , Cathy reckoned ; but a mood of recklessness was upon her . " Do n't mind if I do , " she said . Morgan poured the goblets full of ancient , potent brandy  --  a liquor that Cathy had never tasted before in her life . Before she had it half down the room was beginning to swing about her head in circles . " Another ? " Morgan said softly . " God , no ! " Cathy gasped ; " I feel awful ! " " Excuse me a moment , " Morgan said ; " I 'll get you something for that . " She was gone a long time . Then the door opened again , and Cathy looked up . But it was not Morgan who stood there . It was a man . A tall man  --  Henry Montcliffe . " Cathy . . . " he whispered thickly , " my little Cathy ... . " What do you want ? " Cathy said . " You , " Henry Montcliffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her mouth . His breath was heavy with liquor , and Cathy turned her head away from him . His hands came down upon her shoulders . Cathy felt herself being borne over backward , then lifted , and thrown down across the bed , hard . His big hand was among her skirts ,  | hot upon the flesh of her thigh . And it came to Cathy then that she had been tricked . Then the rage rose in her and beat about her temples . It cleared away the fumes of the brandy . She brought her knees up until they crowded against her small breasts , and kicked out with both feet . They caught Henry Montcliffe full in the belly and sent him over backward . Then she came up off the bed , fast , and picked up the lamp from the night table . Fortunately for Henry it was not lit . She lifted it in both hands and brought it down upon his head . It broke into pieces , being made of china , and the blood and the kerosene mingled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted by the noise , came back into the room she was already gone , scurrying down the stairs and out into the night . Morgan stood there looking down at Henry Montcliffe , groaning on the floor . Then clearly , delightedly , she began to laugh . " That Cathy ! " she said . " A girl after my own heart ! "  | Chapter 18 " READY , BRUTUS ? " Ross said . " Yassuh , Marse Ross , we 's ready . " Ross looked at the boy , Numa , a proud stripling now  --  almost as tall as his father , and at black Rachel , grown a little heavier with the years , which made her look all the more like a queen . They were the last . All the other Negroes were gone . He felt a momentary anger at the method he had had to use to free them , finally  --  slipping them off by twos and threes to the wild , wooded country north of Finiterre . But after tonight he could breathe , for Brutus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in the Supreme Court finally , won it months ago . Through the uproar of men cursing and waving their canes and threatening to lynch Ross Pary , the judge had handed down the decision that although the State law forbade the freeing of Negroes , it had been designed to prevent the increase of free blacks within the borders of the state , and since the plaintiff Ross Pary had declared his intention of removing the Negroes to Africa , the law hardly applied in this case . That should have been all of it , but it was n't . For , when in the fall of 1859 , Ross Pary returned to Mount isr , determined to carry out his own wishes in the matter , he found himself faced with the threat of physical violence at t hr hands of then who had been his neighbors and his friend , He and Cathy got down from the carriage to hud the hunt yard filled with a crowd of mote than a hunehrel tarn . The men parted and let them through until they trachrd the gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen ? " Ross said . A heavy set man , whom Ross recognized as Anthony Niven , an upriver planter , stepped forward . " Pary , " he said , " we 're here to tell you that if you set those niggers free , we 're going to stop you . We 'll stop you peacefully if we can , ' cause we have n't a thing against you personally . You 've been a good planter , and a good neighbor . " But , right now , the future of the South 's at stake . Them black Republicans are gaining power every day . Let them seat a man in the White House and it 'll mean war . Things like this only help them out . So , Pary , if we have to , we 'll use force .... " He paused , looking around him at the other men . " We 're prepared , " he said heavily , " to hang or shoot every nigger what attempts to leave this place  --  and you with ' em , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had my say . You 've been warned . " Cathy could see Ross stiffen , and she laid a restraining hand upon his arm . But he took a step forward , his blue eyes cold as ice , and just as hard . " All right , Niven , " he said ; " you 've had your say , now I 'll have mine . I see before me a fine example of Southern chivalry , and of Southern courage . It took an immense amount of bravery , did n't it , for a hundred of you to ride up here to tell one man what he must do . " I 've always wondered why dogs and jackals travel in packs ; now I know . . . Cathy could see the rage flaming in their eyes , but Ross went on unperturbed . " You say you 'll kill my blacks , and kill me , too , if I persist . Very well . I 've always been prepared to die for what I believe in . That 's not the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear Niven , if you force me to it , I shall arm my Negroes and meet fire with fire . And I make you my solemn promise before the God I serve , that I shall make sure that you and the other five or six ringleaders in this business do not leave the field alive . Now if you want to prevent me from doing what the courts of this State and the laws of the land have given me a perfect right to do , go ahead ; but damn your filthy souls to hell , be prepared to take the consequences ! "  | He turned then , and marched with Cathy on his arm into the house . And Cathy and Jennie waited anxiously for a halt an hour while the men milled about outside and muttered threats . Then , finally , they rode away . On the first of October , Ross began removing the Negroes from the place . At Jennie 's plea , he did so secretly , to avoid conflict . A wagon load of small faggots moved northward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches , ten Negroes lay . The blacks slipped by twos and threes every night , and hid in the woods north of Finiterre . Many bales of cotton , each con taining a man , were carried down to Ross 's steamboat landing . and a vessel took them away , landing them about fifty miles below New Orleans . The few Negroes left sang and talked loudly in the quarters , and round about Moonrise , the men watching at the fires got tired of waiting . " He 's given up , " they said ; " we 've got him licked . " And now , finally , upon this October night , 1859 , Ross Vary and Brutus and Rachel and the boy , Numa , climbed down the bluffs before Moonrise , and got into a skiff . The men watching around the plantation had not thought of this . Brutus and Numa took up the oars , and the skiff moved northward , against the current . There , four miles above Finiterre , the steamboat waited , commanded by a man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if paid enough . He already had steam up . Ross and the last of his slaves carte aboard , and the sternwheels threw white water . The smoke stood up from the stacks , blacker than the night itself , and the Mississippi shore slid backward slowly . At Biloxi , a vinegary Maine captain , who had decided ideas upon the subject of human slavery , waited with his ship . He had already taken on a consignment , bound for the Mediterranean ; but he was willing to make a detour of some hundreds of miles to land the blacks on the ' West African Coast . When , six months before , the case had already become a national cause cele b n e , Captain Benton had written Ross and offered his services Through the mail and in strictest privacy , the arrangements had been made . So it was that now Ross Pary stood on the deck of the Augusta  | with his people clustered about him . The younger children were laughing and playing , but most of the older blacks were in tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prayer for their safety . Then he started down the ladder to the little boat that would take him ashore , and they crowded about him crying and kissing his hands . Ross wept , too , and he was not ashamed of it . Then as he moved off from the ship , Rachel started to sing something . It was a spiritual , but Ross had never heard it before . And one by one the other voices took it up until they were all singing it . The words rolled out over the water , thunderously deep on the basses of the men , and angel-sweet in the women 's high soprano tones . Straining his ears through the splashing of the oars that bore him toward Biloxi , Ross could just make out some of the words . " Before I 'll be a slave , " the Negroes sang ; " I 'll be buried in my grave , and go home to my Lord , and be free ! " " Amen , " Ross whispered , watching the smoke come up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masts and cording , " Amen ! " And the Augusta stood out to sea . He got back to Natchez on the afternoon of October 16th , 1859 ? the very worst day he could have chosen to come home . David and Jennie and Cathy were at the landing waiting for him in a landau with a pile of lap robes on the floor between the seats . " Quick , " Cathy said urgently ; " lie down on the floor ! Get under the robes ! " Ross stared at her . " Why ? " he said ; " what 's all this foolishness about , Cathy ? " " Do as I say ! " she snapped . " They 'll kill you ! " " Who 'll kill me ? " Ross asked patiently . " Whom do you want to hide me from ? " " The people , " Jennie said ; " Ross , today that old fool John Brown raided Harpers Ferry in Virginia in order to start a nationwide slave uprising . The people are pretty excited  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That man Niven came back yesterday and found the quarters empty and you gone . Oh , Ross , they might kill you ! They really might ! "  | " I see , " Ross said . Then , " Dave , take the girls home . " " Look , Ross , " David began . " Do as I say ! " Ross thundered ; " I do n't sneak into town untie ' a blanket  --  not even to save my life . " " I knew he 'd say that ! " Cathy wept . " Oh , you big , stupid jackass  --  I do n't want you killed ! " " And I thought so too , " David said , " that 's why 1 had a nigger I borrowed from Finiterre follow us on Nancy . llc 's waiting over there . You got a gun , Ross ? " " Yes , " Ross said ; " I have a gun . " " Then you better ride like hell , " David said . " Thanks , Dave , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbed ; " you damned , stupid fool  --  - have n't you brought me sorrow enough already ? " " Reckon I have , " Ross smiled . " Maybe , now , you 'll be rid ofine .... " But I do n't want to be rid of you , darling ! " Cathy wept ; " I do n't wan ? " But Ross stopped her protests with his mouth . Then he was off , running toward where the black waited with Nancy . He mounted and started up Silver Street ; but , to their astonishment , he rode very slowly . " Oh my God ! " Cathy said ; " he 's too damned stubborn to even run ! " David Martin pulled at the reins and they started off after him . " Maybe he 's right , Cathy , " he said ; " to come pounding through Main at a gallop might attract too much attention . " Ross had thought of that , so he rode slowly , quietly through the crowds . Nobody noticed him until he was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bulk and thundered : " There 's one of the same kind ' There 's that damned niggerloving Fary right now ! " The men started forward at a rush , and Ross pulled his revolver out and sat on Nancy , waiting . " I 'm not running , men , " he said quietly ; " I do n't want to kill any of you ; but , by heaven , I will if I have to . " They hesitated . Tony Niven danced up and down with fury . " Do n't let him buffalo you , men ! " he bellowed ; " he ca n't kill us all ! "  | Instead of answering , Ross brought the revolver up and sent a shot crashing into the earth exactly between Niven 's widespread feet . The bullet plowed up the earth , splattering it over his boots . " No , " Ross said pleasantly , reining Nancy to one side as he spoke until she moved in upon Niven ; " but I can kill you , Niven . And it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move aside and let me through , or you 'll get it right where it 'll do you the most good . I can scarcely miss from here . " Anthony Niven stared at him , his beet-red face paling . " You win , this time , " he said ; " but I demand satisfaction . You 'll meet me at Vidalia tomorrow ! " " Gladly , " Ross smiled ; " I have the choice of weapons , of course ? " Niven hesitated . Supposed the damned fool chooses rapiers , he thought . Anthony Niven was notorious for his clumsiness . " What 's the matter , Tony ? " some one in the crowd called . " Scairt ? " " You have your choice , " he said huskily . Ross smiled at him . " Bowie knives , " he said gently ; " over a handkerchief at three paces , our left arms to be bound together . Good day , gentlemen . " Tony Niven stood there , sweating . He could see those flashing blades now , feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pary , damn him , he thought , is thin as a sidewinder and just as quick . Hell , he 'd slash me to ribbons while I was getting set ... . So thinking , he jerked his revolver out , and sent a bullet whining a scant half inch above Ross 's head . Then Ross turned in the saddle and shot him . The ball caught Niven in the fleshy part of the right arm , breaking the bone . But out of pure terror , he spun and fell so convincingly that all the others thought him dead . They started shooting at Ross ; he flattened himself out along Nancy 's neck , and rode like hell , while the men in the street scattered , bolting toward their horses , and a moment later they were pounding through Main Street after him , slashing their horses ' flanks with whip and spur , leaning forward , standing in the stirrups.  | Ross came out of the town on the road that led toward Moonrise and Finiterre . But that was a bad thing , Ior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and those who lived in it . Those men riding hell for leather behind him meant business . They were not wasting their ammunition by trying the difficult feat of trying to shoot him from the saddle at a gallop . No , they meant to corner him like a rat , and deal with him at their leisure ... . He 'd have to turn off the road , make a break for it through the brush , lose himself among the trees . Here , a good chance of that existed ; but he wanted to put a bend of the road between himself and them before he turned oH , hoping to confuse them even momentarily . But as he rounded the curve leaning far over toward the inside sweep of it so as not to upset Nancy 's balance , he almost crashed headlong into a rider coming from the opposite direction . He had barely time enough to yank Nancy 's head savagely into a tighter turn , and leap her over the ditch into the high brush . But as her feet came down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rider was Morgan Brittany , mounted upon Satana . That does it , he thought ; she 'll tell there sure as hell , and curl her little pink toes inside her boots from joy watching them string me up . . . . But the oak grove was to his left , thick and dark , so he pounded into it , and drew Nancy up , waiting . He saw the men come boiling around the curve in a cloud of dust , and then they were pulling up , milling around Morgan , and Ross could see her pointing  --  away from him , into the swampy morass on the other side of the road , away from him , with a slight , negligent gesture giving him back his life . They went over the ditch in rows , and disappeared among the further trees . Ross sat there waiting , and , as he expected , Morgan turned Satana off the road and came riding in the direr tion he had taken . When she was close , he rode out and met he t . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling . " Why , Ross ? " " Those boys got a mite riled up over my bad timing . I tuna d my Negroes loose the day before John Brown raided I I:u p t Ferry . I came back into town shortly after the news ( ante hum Virginia . And if I 'm not exactly John Brown , they thought Id make a mighty good substitute . "  | " Come on , " Morgan laughed , " let 's ride . " " Where ? " " Finiterre . I 'll hide you until this blows over . " " It wo n't blow over , Morgan , " Ross said quietly ; " I 'm afraid I 've killed a man in the bargain . " Morgan looked at him , and Ross could see the fire leaping behind her black eyes . " Then you 'll have to leave Natchez for good ! " " Yes , " Ross said sadly ; " I was planning to anyhow ; but not so damned fast . Reckon I 'll go up to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just where , " Morgan asked sweetly , " are you going to catch a boat or a train ? " " Oh , damn ! " Ross groaned ; " I had n't thought of that ! " " But I have . Come on , darling , we 'll ride to Finiterre  --  and I 'll buy the tickets . " Ross stared at her , hard . He could n't believe this . As long as he had known her , Morgan had never stepped out of character for an instant . Now , in one day , she had saved his life , and was preparing to help him escape  --  him and Cathy . Tickets , she had said , I 'll buy the tickets . " Oh , come on ! " They rode northward through the brush , and came out near the high gate that had cost Lance Brittany his life . Morgan saw Ross looking at it , and reached over and touched his hand . " Do n't think about that , now , " she whispered . When the Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to them : " Take Mister Pary 's mare around to the stables , and saddle a horse for him . This animal , " she added to Ross , " is completely blown ... " You think I 'll have to ride again ? " Ross said . " I do n't know . I just want to be prepared . I 'm going to get on the upriver boat and pay the Captain to stop here , at the foot of the bluff . You can come aboard there . Then we 'll go to Cincinnati and ? " " We ? " Ross stared at her ; " we ! " " Of course , darling ! You did n't think I was going to purchase passage for that freckled wench you married ? Oh , Ross , how stupid  | of you ! I 'm going North with you , dearest  --  that 's the price you have to pay for your freedom . " " And when we get there ? " Ross said coldly . " I 'll be your sweet little helpmeet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , " Ross said quietly , " no , Morgan . " Morgan smiled at him . " Help me down , darling , " she said . Ross put up his arms and lifted her down , but she put her two hands on his shoulders and stiffened her elbows so that she slid down slowly along all his length . Then she stood before him , serene , secret-smiling . " Kiss me , Ross , " she said . " I salute you , " Ross said bitterly , " the murderess of my brother ; the killer of your husband .... " Then he kissed her . Morgan drew her little , heart-shaped face away from his and stared at him . " I did n't make the error that caused Tom 's death , " she said ; " I avenged it . And I ridded myself of a man I hated , in order to have the man I love . You 'd blame me for that , Ross ? You , who were the cause of it all ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame or praise or any other consideration that affects the lives of men . The rules you live by were made for angels or for devils  --  I do n't know which .... " " Come into the house , Ross , " Morgan said eagerly . " I 'm going to hide you . I 'm going to get those tickets . Once we get to New York , you can still send for your Cathy  --  if you still want to . My guess is that you wo n't want to  --  since you do n't love her , never have loved her , and never will .... " " I 'll still send for her , Morgan , " Ross warned . " Up here , " Morgan said , " there 's a room in the attic , that they do n't know about . You 'll be safe there . So you think that you 'll send for Cathy . Yes , come to think of it  --  you would . You 've always gotten your feet entangled in your precious conceptions of honor and decency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole ointment is  --  I do n't believe your little Cathy would come . " " Why not ? " Ross growled . " Henry Montcliffe , " Morgan said . " You 're lying ! " Ross spat .  | Morgan turned upon the landing of the last flight of stairs before the attic and caught at his lapels . " I 'm not lying , Ross , " she said . " I only lie to stupid men . But what good would it do me to tell you a lie that you could disprove so easily ? For instance , if I told you they 'd cuckolded you , I would be lying . They have n't  --  yet . All they 've done is to see each other constantly here at Finiterre , with my assistance . " Ross looked at her . " With your assistance , " he said . " That figures , does n't it ? " " Yes . I wanted her to run off with him . Then you 'd be left ? for me . I said once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I was right  --  it is . Only  --  after you left me , I found out that there 're worse things than being foolish .... " She looked up at him , and tears were there suddenly , bright in her eyes . " All right , " she said bitterly ; " you can be proud , Ross Pary  --  because you 're looking at a fool ! " " Go get those tickets , Morgan , " Ross said . But , afterwards , sitting there in the darkness in the attic , he had time to think about it . His thoughts ran around in circles , getting him nowhere . There was the shape of betrayal in them , the black of treachery . There was the ugliness of anger , and of jealousy and of grief . He walked up and down rubbing his hands together until he came to the door . He stopped short , looking at that door in the gloom . It was of heavy timbers , hung with strap iron hinges . It was  --  or had been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it led , all he had to do was to pull up a small brass stop attached to the bottom of it , and it would swing dosed behind him . But now the counterweight was missing from the cords that ran over the pulleys . Ross looked around until he found the weight sitting in the corner . He attached it to the cords and tried the door . It worked perfectly , swinging shut the instant he took the pressure of his hand away from it . Funny that Morgan did n't have that fixed , he thought . Then it came to him that it was equally strange that he had fixed it . It 's the idleness , he mused , and the waiting .... Why the devil do n't those beggars come ? He tried the door and this time it swung open wider , and he caught a glimpse of some objects on the floor . In the dim light ,  | filtering in from a tiny , barred ventilator under the peak of the roof , he could n't make out what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in . The moment he turned it loose , it started to swing shut , and he had to leap and catch it . As he set the brass stop , he looked at it . There was no handle on the inside of it , no knob , nothing . Whoever had built that door , had n't meant for it to be opened from the inside . And the moment Ross lit a match , he saw why . There were manacles attached to the floor by lengths of chain . On the walls were hung whips as cruel as the ones he 'd felt in Cuba . Ross put out his hand to take one of them , but then he drew it back . He did n't need to pick up one of the damnable things . Bessie , before she had been hanged that night , had n't lied . Not even about this had she lied . He backed out of the room , and released the'stop so that the door swung shut . As he started down the stairs , it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much better it was after all merely to lose his life . With Morgan a man could lose more . Much more . He came out into the sunlight , and mounted the horse the Negroes had brought around to the hitching post before the house . He started riding northward , towards Vicksburg , thinking : Damn them , they 've had all the time in the world ! And they had had . But for the two hours they had spent pull ing one of their number and his horse out of the sticky black mud of the swamp into which Morgan Brittany had directed theta , t hey would have reached Finiterre long ago . When they did reach it , they circled the place and one of them went into the stable and found Nancy standing there , still saddled . " She did trick us , boys , " he growled ; " the bastard 's here all right  --  his nag 's out in the stable . " They surrounded the house then and started shooting into it , and the two or three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anything else they could get their hands on . The townsmen let them pass . At the moment , they were n't interested in killing Negroes . One of them stood up , and called : " Come on out , Pary ! We know you 're in there . " There was no answer .  | " Reckon we 'll have to smoke him out , " another one said . " Well  --  now  --  it ai n't his house . " " Its hern ! And she damn near got us all drowned in that blackgum swamp ! " " Damned right . Burn it , I say . " The leader stepped forward again . " Come on out , Pary , " he said , " or we 'll burn that shack around you ! " But , when they did start to fire Finiterre , they found it difficult . It had been a wet fall , and the twigs and moss they gathered refused to do more than smolder , sending up great puffs of smoke . Even when the rugs and curtains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Riding northward , Ross Pary saw the smoke , and whirled his horse around . At the landing , below the house , Morgan saw it , and started running down the plank before it had touched ground , and up the path that wound up the bluff . She came up on the terrace , panting , and slashed open the face of the man who tried to stop her with her riding crop , and dashed into the house . All the way up the stairs she was screaming his name . The smoke boiled into her lungs , but she kept on , falling and getting up , and crawling up the last flight until she came to the room where she had left him . She groped around it from side to side , running her hands over the walls , the floor . Then she remembered the other room , and pushed with all her strength against the heavy door . It came open and she fell through it , and lay on the floor sobbing and gasping for breath and the door swung shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Montcliffe , of Natchez , men deeply opposed to the methods of such men as Anthony Niven and his followers , Cathy saw the smoke , too . Only , by the time they reached Finiterre , there was flame in it , too . They poured through the high gate , sending up great clods of mud from their horses ' hoofs , and the men who had burnt it , turned and ran for their horses , and hurtled away northward  | into the thick woods above Finiterre . And not a shot was fired in anger . The men dismounted and formed a bucket brigade from the big house down to the spring and fought the fire stubbornly for half an hour , with Cathy taking her place in the line next to Henry Montcliffe and working as hard as any of them . Twenty minutes later Ross Pary rode back into the courtyard and took up a bucket with the rest , and they kept the buckets moving down the line to the spring house and back again full , and the men at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won finally , after two hours of back-breaking labor . That they won , that the fire was put out , was due as much to the three-week siege of rains that had preceded this day as to their efforts . And Ross Pary walked away from the line to the bluff and stood there looking at the beautiful house he had built , blackened by smoke , and ruined on the ground floor by fire , but not beyond repair . He sighed , and half turned , and then he saw the upriver steamboat waiting quietly at the landing . And he realized then , that some of the men in that line , the ones he did n't know , must have been passengers and crew members from the boat , and last of all , more slowly  --  that Morgan must have got here after all . He started for the house then , running , but before he reached it , Cathy put out her hand and caught his arm . " Ross ! " she said , " now what the devil ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Henry Montcliffe heard him , and he and some of the others started up the stairs after Ross . The house was still filled with smoke , and smelled of burnt wood and cloth . They found Ross Pary in the attic , in that strange room , leaning weakly back against the wall staring at the inert figure on the floor . One of them went down to the third floor and came back with an oil lamp . Morgan was lying on her side , with her face turned toward the door . Her face was smudged with smoke , through which her tears had made white streaks . Otherwise , there was not a mark upon her . But  --  she was dead . " Holy Jesus ! " George Metcalfe said , " look at her fingernails ! " Ross looked at her hands . The nails were broken off down to  | the quicks , and the ends of her fingers were bloody . And on the door were long , deeply gouged furrows . She had n't been unconscious , Ross realized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the direction her face was turned , he saw that she had n't . Morgan 's eyes were wide open , staring upon unimaginable horrors . " Smoke , I reckon , " Henry Montcliffe muttered . Ross stared at him . Then quietly he bent down and picked Morgan up in his arms . He came down the stairs with her and placed her tenderly in a swing on the gallery , and put up his hand and closed her eyes and took off his frock coat and covered her with it . When he turned , Cathy saw his face . She did n't say anything to him . She merely turned and walked away from him toward her horse , and mounted and rode away through the high gate toward Moonrise . Ross mounted then , and rode after her . She drew up her mount and waited for him and they rode down the road together without saying anything . Finally , just before they reached Moonrise , Cathy turned to him . " What are you going to do now ? " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and Cathy stiffened . " You 're going North , Ross , " she said ; " I 'm staying . " Ross looked at her , pain moving in his eyes . " You 'd leave me over this ? " he said . " I , " Cathy said , in that flat voice of hers , " am tired of living with the ghosts of your old loves , Ross . Yes  --  I 'd leave you over this . " They came back to Moonrise , silently , sadly . Ross began to pack slowly , with Cathy sitting there watching him , her elbows resting upon her knees , and her chin upon the palms of her hands . " Cathy , " Ross said , " I 'm asking you to come with me . " " No , " Cathy said .  | Chapter 19 IN THE late fall of i86o , Jennie Martin received a letter . At first she thought it was from Ross , because it came from New York ; but then she saw it was sent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it was addressed to Mrs. Thomas Pary . But for the fact that it was also addressed to Moonrise , and the postmaster in Natchez knew Jennie well , she might not have gotten it at all . She opened it and read : " Dearest Jennie , I have the happiness to be back in America after so many years of absence . Yet I have also sadness , because everything reminds me of my beloved Ross  --  who died in my behalf so long ago . " Jennie straightened up . Who died ? Is she mad ? " Then she went back to the letter . " It was originally planned that I should come to New Orleans ? but since the election of that strange , wonderful Abraham Lincoln , there is so much talk of war , that my manager , M. Bergson , thought it wiser to cancel them . I am a dancer now , called , extravagantly , I think , ' La Habanera . ' I wanted so much to come to New Orleans , for then it would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more the house of him who became my husband  --  did you know that , Jennie ? But how could you  --  since he died in Cuba . " I do n't think that I shall ever stop loving him , or forget the smallest gesture of his . He was so wonderful , my Ross . I can  | write no more . The memory is insupportable . Please , if you can , write me , Jennie mia  --  I shall never forget your wedding . Adios , Conchita . " Jennie looked at the letter just once more and that was to mark the address of the theatre from which it was written . Then she dashed down the stairs and mounted her horse , and set off for Natchez at a hard gallop .
