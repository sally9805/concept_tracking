The textile experts said it was folly : garment factories could never flourish in Hong Kong because of lack of water and trained workers . Besides , there was the powerful new force of Japanese competition . But Chen Che Lee , a wealthy young Shanghai cotton manufacturer , fooled the experts . In 1946 , with $1,500,000 borrowed from friends , Lee established South China Textile , Ltd. , the first major textile mill in Hong Kong . Over the past decade , problems have been over come , and from Lee 's daring example has grown an industry that this year will ex port $110 million worth of garments . So successful is Hong Kong as a garment center that U.S. manufacturers and labor unions now want restrictions on cotton exports to the U.S. Last week Industry Leader C. C. Lee was again hard at work . His association of the most powerful exporters to the U.S. was working out a plan to diversify , set up self-imposed export quotas that will satisfy the U.S. <P> Hong Kong has been greatly helped by U.S. opposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to diversify and impose voluntary quotas , many big U.S. department-and variety-store buyers took their business to Hong Kong . The British colony 's factories and sweatshops have tripled to an estimated 500 in the past four years , boosted the number of workers from 4,000 to 50,000 . To compete in the cut throat world textile market , the Hong Kong garmentmakers ' chief weapon has been cheap labor ; the average daily wage is $1.77 for a ten-to twelve-hour day . <P> Three Shifts . While the bulk of the goods is still produced by industrious Chinese pieceworkers in cramped cubby holes and back rooms , more and more are coming from new , modern factories such as Lee 's . He employs 5,000 workers , v. 150 when he started , has one factory running three full shifts a day , spinning , weaving , dyeing , cutting and sewing cot ton garments for export . Last August he added a new factory to weave 1,000,000 yds. of cloth per month , cut 60,000 gar ments a day . His own garment exports to the U.S. , 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1956 to $12 million this year . <P> Others have prospered along with Lee , and the Hong Kong garment industry to day has estimated assets worth $200 million . Exports to the U.S. ( chiefly brassires , nightgowns , pajamas , blouses and men 's slacks and shirts ) are expected to be more than $80 million this year , a 140% increase over last year . Though still less than 3% of total U.S. consumption , it is the concentration of items in particular areas that has most aroused U.S. industry and labor opposition . In the field of brassieres alone , Hong Kong imports account for an estimated 40% of the U.S. market . <P> Discipline . To see what could be done , U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Henry Kearns journeyed to Hong Kong fortnight ago . Said Kearns to a meeting of Hong Kong garment leaders for the second time in a year : " Do n't reduce your exports . Just do n't ship unduly heavy quantities which would wreck a specific American industry . " To many a successful Hong Kong Chinese garmentmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for a success built with little U.S. aid in the face of stiff Japanese and European competition . Many are balking , though Lee argues that the industry " has grown too fast , must discipline itself " for the long-term benefit .
