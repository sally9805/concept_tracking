" The general is a heavy , gigantic man . His eyes lie deep in his massive face . His nature is jovial . He appears phlegmatic . But I suspect that the joviality can fall like a mask , and the somewhat flabby features grow taut . His lips are thin . I will not be surprised if I hear him make hard decisions . " So wrote a German Communist of " General Gomez , " commander of the International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War , and a professional soldier in the cause of Communism . <P> Born in 1893 in Germany 's turbulent Ruhr , Gomez was actually Wilhelm Zais-ser . He had got his taste for fighting in Germany 's World War I army , in which he rose to the rank of lieutenant . When the bloody " workers ' rebellion " broke out in the Ruhr in 1923 , Zaisser organized workers ' brigades . He was already known as the " Red General of the Ruhr . " Taken prisoner , he escaped to Russia , where he became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the Nazi regime , he returned to Germany , a leader and organizer of the Communist underground . <P> After his Spanish Civil War days , he went to Moscow , only to be thrown into a Russian jail , apparently because of the failure of Communist intervention in Spain . The resourceful Stalin remembered him when Germany attacked Russia in 1941 , put him to work indoctrinating German officers taken prisoner . Zaisser , as he now called himself again , helped build a renegade German army inside Russia . But it was four years before Stalin let him go back to Germany . In 1945 he turned up in Saxony-Anhalt as chief of police . His real job was building up the 130,000-man Volkspolizei , the paramilitary Communist police army in East Germany . He was made State Security Minister in the East German government . <P> Last week , in a shakeup following the June 17 workers ' revolt , Zaisser was one of half a dozen who lost their jobs . He was the biggest to fall . His Ministry of State Security was merged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the German Communist Party 's Central Committee and the German Politburo . The official reason : " Representing a wing hostile to the party , and being an exponent of the defeatist line calculated to undermine the unity of the party . "
