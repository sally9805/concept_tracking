Since it was established in 1946 , Congress ' Joint Committee on Atomic Energy has been an effective board of directors for the U.S. atomic-energy program . But in the ten weeks of the 83rd Congress , the committee ( nine Senators , nine Representatives ) has been losing its grip . The reason : a Senate v. House deadlock over the chairmanship . <P> A Senator has always headed the committee . The first chairman , in the Republican 80th Congress , was Iowa 's steady , hard-working Bourke B. Hickenlooper . In the Democratic 81st , Connecticut 's yeasty Brien McMahon took over , to serve until he died last July . House members insist that there was an " understanding " that the chairmanship would alternate between the Senate and the House . ( They let McMahon serve out of turn because he had sponsored the act establishing the committee . ) Senate members do n't seem to recall any such understanding . <P> When Congress convened in January , the Senate committeemen insisted that their senior Republican member , Hickenlooper , step back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior Republican , New York 's W. Sterling Cole . Hickenlooper and " Stub " Cole remained good friends , but other members split : eight Senators for Hickenlooper , eight Representatives for Cole . <P> Under North Carolina 's ailing Democratic Representative Carl Durham , who was McMahon 's vice chairman , the committee has tried to function on a tentative basis ; but Government agencies , which have worked closely with the chairman in the past , now have no key man to contact . Members , fearful that they might tip the chairmanship stalemate the wrong way , have been clam-quiet on some important issues , e.g. , the Navy 's failure to promote Captain Hyman G. Rickover , the atomic-submarine expert . <P> Last week committee members were shifting nervously , realizing that unless the deadlock is broken soon , the atomic program and the U.S. will suffer .
