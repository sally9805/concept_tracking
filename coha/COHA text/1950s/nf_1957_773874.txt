txt AT THE RISK OF BECOMING TECHNICAL , IT MAY HELP TOWARD an understanding of modern music to compare the human conception of musical consonance and dissonance with a few acoustic principles . The art of music and the practice of harmony have been developed according to what has pleased human ears ; they have been evolved by musicians , not by scientists . Nevertheless , as one compares the growth of the art of music and the extension of its basic principles with the laws of acoustics , he finds an interesting parallel between the two . In other words , men have found most pleasing to their ears the combinations of those tones that bear certain mathematical relationships of vibrations to one another , even though they may not have been aware that those relation-ships existed . All sound is caused by vibration . What we call a noise is produced by irregular vibration ; a musical tone by a regular vibration which may be counted and timed . The rate of vibration determines the pitch ; the faster the vibration , the higher the tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above middle C is produced by a vibration at the rate of 440 im pulses a second . The A an octave below vibrates at the rate of 220 a second , or half as fast ; while the A an octave above has 880 vibrations a second , or twice as many . A musical tone reaches the ear through the vibration of the atmosphere , which is set in motion by the vibration of a string ( in the case of stringed instruments and of the vocal cords of human beings ) , or by a vibrating column of air // ( in the case of wind instruments ) . Neither the strings nor the columns of air , however , vibrate as a whole throughout the entire duration of the vibration ; they break into vibrating segments that produce what are known as " overtones , " or subsidiary tones of higher pitch . Sometimes these are called " harmonics " or " upper partials . " The ear hears these over-tones even though it does not distinguish them and recog-nizes only the pitch of the principal tone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . The flute produces the fewest overtones of any intrument , therefore it has the purest tone , but one that is not particularly colorful . You yourself can conduct an interesting experiment in overtones at the piano keyboard . Press down the key of C an octave below middle C , without sounding the tone . Hold it down while you strike sharply the C two octaves below middle C. Be sure not to press the damper pedal . For an instant you will hear the tone you have actually struck , but as it quickly dies away , you will hear the tone from the key you did n't strike , but for which you are raising the damper and allowing the string to vibrate . The sound you hear is caused by the upper C vibrating in so-called sympathetic vibration with the note you struck . The higher C is the first overtone of the lower C. When you struck the lower C , its overtone caused the air to vibrate at a certain rate , and started the string tuned to that pitch to vibrating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tone , the G below middle C. Strike the low C in the same manner , and you 'll hear the tone of G , not as clearly as you heard the upper C , but clearly enough to distinguish it . Then repeat the experiment with the E above middle C , and you 'll have the same result , still fainter , but audible . ' . What you have actually been doing in these experiments is // to follow the series of natural overtones , sometimes known as the Harmonic Series . This is represented in musical nota-tion by the following table : Overtones 6 and 10 , enclosed in parentheses , are not perfectly represented by the notes on the staff . Overtone 6 is somewhat lower , or flatter , than B flat , and 10 is about half-way between F and F sharp . In your experiment , you produced at the start the first overtone of C : the C an octave higher . Next , you produced the second overtone , G. For our experiment we omitted the third overtone , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably fainter , was E. With these three overtones , C , G , and E , you have sounded the three tones that produce the common chord of C : Authorities may differ as to the actual connection between the so-called harmonic series of overtones and the development of tonal combinations in music . It is impossible , however , to ignore the parallel between the two , one a science and the other an art , and to fail to observe that the tones which have been accepted by Western ears as producing agreeable , or consonant , sounds in combination with other // given tones have corresponded roughly with the natural overtones of those given tones . Moreover , the historic order in which these tones have come into the musical vocabulary forms an almost identical pattern with the harmonic series . This brings us to the subject of " intervals , " an interval being the distance between two tones of the musical scale . Thus , a melodic interval is the distance between two adjacent tones of a melody and a harmonic interval the distance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano keyboard may be used for computing intervals . Use the scale of C major , which is represented by the eight white keys starting with middle C , or , for that matter , with any C , and ending with the C an octave above . An interval is computed by counting both the lower and upper tones of the interval , as well as those between . Thus , the interval from C to the D above it is a second ; we counted two keys , C and D. From C to E is a third , for we counted three keys , C , D , E. Similarly , from C to F is a fourth ; from C to G a fifth ; from C to A a sixth ; from C to B a seventh ; and from C to the upper C an eighth , or octave . Continuing further , from middle C to the D above the next higher C is a ninth . These intervals would appear as follows in music notation : The connection between the vibrating rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may be defined as a combination of tones that is agreeable and satis fying , as opposed to dissonance ) is illustrated by the fact that the first interval to be accepted as consonant was the // octave . The octave , we have found , is the first overtone in the series , and its rate of vibration is either double or half of that of the basic tone , depending on whether it is higher or lower than the basic tone . The history of music records attempts at harmony from as early as the ninth century . Earlier than that the Greeks had merely sung an octave above or below the melody when they sang in parts . Harmony , of course , is the simultaneous sounding of two or more tones , producing what we know as a chord . In written or printed music , a chord , or harmonic combination , is shown in a vertical arrangement of notes : In the earliest attempts at harmony , the only intervals considered consonant were the octave , the fourth , and the fifth . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the octave is the first natural overtone , the fifth is number 2 . In the tempered scale , the fourth is the complement of the fifth , by inversion . In other words , while the interval from C to G is a fifth , if we put the G below the C , instead of above it , we have a fourth , computing downward from CtoG : The crude harmony of the ninth century consisted of singing in parts that were an octave , a fourth , or a fifth , from the // principal melody . This was known as " organum , " which would look something like this in modern notation : The chief development of organum was the acceptance of overtone 2 ( the fifth and its inversion , the fourth ) as forming a consonant or nondissonant harmonic interval with the basic tone . In short , during these earliest attempts at harmony , the only intervals that were considered consonant were the octave , the fourth , and the fifth . It is extraordinary that the composers of organum , pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , ac cepted the only three intervals based on the first two steps of the Harmonic Series : the octave , the fifth , the inversion of the fifth ( the fourth ) . By ear and instinct they followed a path that science did not discover for centuries . You will notice that the parts in organum moved in parallel motion to each other ; when the melody proceeded upward or downward in the scale , the accompanying parts moved in the same direction . Two or three hundred years after organum was developed , a new style came into vogue . This was known as " descant , " in which the voices moved in both parallel and contrary motion , and thus achieved a greater independence : // This eventually led to a horizontal type of part-writing that has become known as " counterpoint . " Counterpoint is the combination of two or more melodies in a horizontal pattern , in contrast to harmony in which the tones are arranged in vertical combination . Counterpoint produces harmony , however , for the tones of each component melody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodies occur simultaneously . If you can persuade one of your friends to sing Dvoiak 's Humoresque while you sing Foster 's Old Folks at Home you will produce counterpoint . The two melodies go well together because their succession of tones happens to be so arranged that each makes a consonance with the tone of the other at the principal points at which they fall together . Counter melodies in orchestrations are a form of counterpoint , as also are obbligati that are played simultaneously with the principal melodies of a composition . In fact , it iS counterpoint that enriches and lends interest to the instrumental , or choral , arrangement of any work . In orchestral or band pieces the wood winds , brass instruments , and strings are constantly given decorative passages and added melodies that offer variety as well as richness to the combined effect . One of the most skillful arrangers of musical comedy scores , Robert Russell Bennett , has written an article about scoring for theater orchestra in which he states : // " Taking anything from a whistled melody to a piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theatrical production demands a great many things besides theatrical training ; but if I were asked what the greatest asset one can have in this work is , I should have to answer , counterpoint . ' . . . The audience , sitting there watching dimpled knees , and listening to tiny voices singing out fa-miliar emotions , has no idea what counterpoint is ; but let it be stiff , forced , or badly distributed , and the knees become less dimpled , the tiny voices grow tinier , and the general atmosphere becomes charged with an unmistakable So what ? What the public does n't know , which is plenty , it very nearly always feels , and that applies to the good things as well as the bad . " 2 Another form of counterpoint is the so-called " imitative " counterpoint , in which various voices or instrumental parts imitate and echo each other by repeating what the others have sung or played . This is the basis of the contrapuntal music of anthems and choral works , and it is also the funda-mental principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A canon is similar to the round , and is constructed on a melody in which the various phrases may be sounded simultaneously with one another . Thus , in the familiar Three Blind Mice , the first group starts singing the opening phrase , " Three blind mice , three blind mice . " As it starts the second phrase , " See how they run , see how they run , " the next group begins the first phrase , " Three blind mice , " etc . Then , when the first group comes to the third phrase , " They all ran after the farmer 's wife , " the second group sings the second phrase , and a third group starts at the beginning . If there are still more singers , as many as six groups may participate , each entering with // the opening phrase as the earlier groups come to the successive phrases : " Who cut off their tails with a carving knife " ; " You never saw such a sight in your life , " and the final , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more involved and complicated development of the canon . The term is derived from the Latin fuga , meaning a flight , which aptly characterizes the chasing of one part by another , as each echoes and imitates what the other has played or sung . Each instrumental or vocal part in a fugue is equal in importance . The principal theme is first announced by one part , and is then taken up successively by the other parts , as the first part continues to unfold the subsequent progress of the theme . Subsidiary themes , and transpositions to different registers , all treated imitatively , render the construction of a fugue a challenging problem to the composer . In the hands of the seventeenth and eighteenth century composers , notably Bach and Handel , counterpoint became one of the most flexible and intricate devices of musical composition . The mighty fugues of Bach are monuments of musical ingenuity and inventiveness , so masterful in their construction that accustomed listeners never tire of hearing them . The oldest known canon , or round , is the thirteenth-century English song , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in the British Museum , came from Reading Abbey , and ' is believed to date from 1240 . The song is not only the oldest known canon , it is also the oldest known harmonized music that is frequently performed today , and the earliest existing composition for six parts . One of the most important features of Summer is icumen in is its employment of the harmonic intervals of the third and sixth . An inversion of any interval that lies within an octave , incidentally , may be computed by subtracting the interval number from 9 . Thus the inversion of a fifth is a fourth , of a // third , a sixth , a second , a seventh , and vice versa . Therefore the relationship of the third and sixth , the intervals used in Sumer is icumen in , is as follows : In the early specimens of " descant " the octave and the fifth ( or fourth ) were still the only intervals that were allowed . With Sumer is icumen in a form of descant known as " Fauxbourdon " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third and sixth . A melody harmonized according to the principles of Fauxbourdon would look like this : With Fauxbourdon , then , overtone 4 was accepted as a consonant interval . It had required over thirteen hundred years , almost a millennium and a half , for the human ear to become accustomed to the combination of three tones that make the simplest chord in the music of the Western world ! With the acceptance of the third and sixth as consonant intervals , the principle of building chords in thirds came into practice . The common chord , or triad , consists of three tones , of which the upper two are arranged as a series of thirds above the fundamental tone : // In this chord each tone is a third removed from its neighbor , while the top tone , G , is a fifth from the basic tone , C. The next step in harmonic development was the introduction of the tone that corresponds roughly with overtone 6 in the harmonic series , and which is a seventh removed from the fundamental tone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itT vT J3d This was indeed a radical departure . Even though the harmonic interval of the seventh was well established by the time of Claudio Monteverdi ( sixteenth and seventeenth centuries ) , it was still considered a dissonance , and its use was limited by rigid rules and limitations . Most of the protests that Monteverdi 's music provoked were caused by his free use of seventh chords . The principle of building chords in thirds was advanced principally by a French composer , Jean Philippe Rameau ( 1683-1764 ) . Rameau also increased the variety of the harmonic vocabulary by discovering that the common chord may be " inverted " by using another of its tones than the fundamental as the lowest tone of the chord . Thus the common chord of C has E for its lowest tone in its first inversion : // and G for its lowest tone in its second inversion : Throughout the entire history of music , the extension of the harmonic vocabulary has consisted largely of adding another third to previously existing chords . In modern music composers make free use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others with even further added thirds : Again , comparison with the table of overtones ( p. 42 ) shows an interesting parallel . In the foregoing example , the ninth and eleventh intervals of the chords ( D and F ) are next in the series of overtones after the seventh ( B flat ) , omitting , of course , overtones 7 and 9 ( C and E ) , which are repetitions , in higher octaves , of lower overtones . Thus , the acceptance of intervals that had formerly been considered dissonant has continued to have its approximate counterpart in the series of natural harmonics , from early times to the present . The harmonic intervals of the ninth and the eleventh ( and , in modern music , the thirteenth ) have not had any easier time in finding acceptance than their predecessors ? the fifth , third , and seventh . Although all of them are now in common use , they have , to quote Aaron Copland in Our New Music , 3 // " only gradually fought their way into the musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take place before they were admitted . " While it is neither necessary nor desirable that these pages should present a detailed exposition of the principles of traditional harmony and counterpoint , there are certain matters the reader should have in mind , particularly in com paring modern music with that of earlier times . When we learn that composers have violated or disregarded the rules that limited their predecessors , it will help matters materially if we know what some of those rules were . The art of harmony deals not only with chords , but , even more important , with the progression of chords ; in other words , with the succession of tone combinations and the way in which the several tones of a chord proceed to those of the following chord . These principles of harmonic pro gression apply also to counterpoint , for while counterpoint is a horizontal combination , or weaving together , of inde pendent melodies , it actually produces harmonic combina tions when tones of the separate melodies are heard together . The pupil studying harmony has traditionally been con-fronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not vio late when he is writing what is called " strict " harmony or counterpoint . The most famous of these rules is that no harmonic progression should contain parallel fifths between any two voices . In short , the composer must not write pro gressions which were used in ninth-century organum . The following passage would be " incorrect " : // because the progression of C to A in the tenor part forms so-called parallel fifths with the progression of C to D in the bass . The two tones were a fifth apart in the first chord , and each moved upward , in the same direction , to form another fifth in the following chord . To be " correct , " the progression should have been written : This avoids the parallel fifths . Similarly , parallel octaves between two parts were forbidden . These rules were broken on occasion , of course , but unless a composer violated them consciously , to produce an intended effect , he was considered unqualified for his profession . The use of seventh chords , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which provide for their resolution and also for their preparation through the chords that precede them . The use of other dissonant tones has also been regulated . Consequently , the traditional rules specify not only what combinations of tones may be used , but what their relationship shall be to the chords that precede and follow them . As the rules have been liberalized and the restrictions have relaxed , further dissonances have been permitted , and composers have been permitted to use them with increasing freedom and independence . To TWENTIETH-CENTURY MUSIC LOVERS , THE WORKS OF CLAUDE Debussy ( 1862 ? 1918 ) mark the beginning of modern music . His harmonic devices were so different from those of earlier music that they necessitated the rewriting of many harmony textbooks , while the mood and atmosphere of his music proved so novel that it was baffling to many on first hearing . In addition , Debussy himself was such a freethinker that he delighted in defying convention , and no doubt enjoyed the discomfiture of his teachers . He subscribed to the radical idea that the composer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is effective than the rules of harmony and counterpoint . Debussy brought to music a style known as impressionism , a direct outgrowth of impressionistic art and literature . Im-pressionism deals with the effect of objects , rather than ob-jects themselves ; The term was first applied derisively to the work of a group of painters headed by Claude Monet in France . In addition to Monet , the impressionist painters included Manet , Degas , Renoir , Pissarro , Ceranne , and Sis-ley . As early as 1867 Monet exhibited a painting which he called Impression : Rising Sun . Visitors to the gallery who expected to see a realistic image of a sunrise were dum-founded to behold what the artist called " the fugitive changes of nature . " For a photographic representation of what the eye actu-ally sees , impressionistic art substitutes the emotional reaction // of the artist to the scene he is painting . It gives a mental image , the sensation aroused by a landscape , a figure , or an object ; it is not concerned with reproducing concrete or tangible things . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephane Mallarme , use words , not for their meaning , but for their sound , as symbols to suggest moods . Debussy 's doubting nature , his inborn habit of questioning the reason for customs , no matter how respectable , made it inevitable that he should be a revolutionary , and his associa-tion with impressionistic artists and writers led him to evolve a similar style in music . He left us a body of works that are marked by shimmering beauty , by vague , filmy , atmospheric effects , hued with delicate tints rather than solid colors . Impressionism is a reaction against realism , and also against the soaring romanticism of such composers as Richard Wagner . It is , however , directly derived from romanticism , for it deals with sensations and with sentiment . It differs from romanticism in abjuring the grand manner ; it has noth-ing of bombast , and instead of offering heroics , it concerns itself with veiled , mystic half-shadows . Although impressionism is almost the direct opposite of realism , it was the work of a realist composer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest influence on Debussy as a freethinker in his music . That was , perhaps , because Mussorgsky represented a complete break-ing away from Wagnerism ; for while Debussy was an ardent Wagnerite in his youth , he came to feel that French music must rid itself of the German romantic influence if it was to be vital and independent . Mussorgsky was a musically uncouth , rugged pioneer , con-cerned primarily with writing music that would be natural and sincere . Inadequately trained , according to conservatory standards , he escaped the German and Italian influences that dominated the late nineteenth-century Russian composers // including , of course , Tchaikovsky . Mussorgsky grew primarily from Russian folksongs , rhythmically and melodically . His harmonic treatment of this material came not from textbooks , but from the modal style of the Greek Catholic church . He did not necessarily question the established rules of harmony , for it is doubtful that he knew them intimately ; he proceeded on the basis that his own ear and musical instinct would lead him to what was appropriate and effective . This resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern composers of a later day . It is not known exactly when Debussy first became familiar with Mussorgsky 's work ; probably not when he was himself in Russia as musical tutor in the establishment of Baroness von Meek ( 1880 ? 82 ) . His first acquaintance with the music of the Russian composer came later , but he was always ready to express his debt to Mussorgsky . They had much in common : a disregard for academic convention , a yearning to be natural and simple , and a high respect for truth in art . Once Debussy remarked that anyone who heard Mussorgsky 's opera , Boris Godounov , would hear the whole of his own Pelleas et Melisande . Fundamentally , there was a wide difference in the approach of the two artists to their problems . Mussorgsky had little training , so he could not be said to have broken rules and traditions consciously . He proceeded largely by instinct , and disregarded convention without being aware of its existence . Debussy was trained rigidly at the Paris Conservatoire . He learned the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did so consciously and intentionally . His revolt began in his student days at the Conservatoire . To his fellow pupils he complained about the strict rules they were compelled to observe ? resolving seventh chords and // dissonances ; avoidance of parallel fifths and octaves ; writing parts in contrary , rather than parallel , motion . He conducted experiments of his own : devising chord combinations that sounded like the bells he had heard in his childhood ; adding to his chords the intervals of the ninth and the eleventh ; making dissonances that were explained by no other reason than that Debussy liked them that way . His extraordinary talents won him the Prix de Rome in 1884 , but his works departed so radically from accepted custom that they shocked the judges when he sent his music home from Italy . The climax was reached when he refused to write the accustomed overture for the concert devoted annually to the works by the prize winner . The concert of Debussy works was not given . This crisis occurred in 1890 , and from that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companionship of painters and artists who were following impressionist ideas . His disillusionment regarding Wagner became complete on a second visit to Bayreuth in 1889 , and though he still admitted the tremendous power of Wagner 's genius , he came to feel that it would stifle those who sought to follow it . He grew more and more consciously French in his viewpoint , and came to refer to himself as " musicien franccais . " He had already produced his L'Enf ant prodigue , the cantata that won for him the Prix de Rome in 1884 , and La Damoiselle glue ( 1887 ? 88 ) ; but his first really challenging works were the String Quartet ( 1893 ) and his Prelude a l'Apres-midi d'un f acne , after Mallarme 's poem ( 1894 ) . In 1900 two of his Nocturnes for Orchestra were first performed ? Nuages and Fetes , and in the following year the third of them was heard ? Sirenes . In 1902 he completed and produced the work he had been laboring on for ten years , an opera on Maeterlinck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the great masterpieces of operatic literature , for it provides one of the most expressive settings of a dramatic text that has ever been composed . The handling of the poem is so skillful that the singers can enunciate the words with almost the naturalness of speech . The orchestral background is at all times an integral part of the drama , neither a mere accompaniment nor yet an independent series of symphonic episodes . Finally , the atmospheric mood of the score , restrained and reticent , gives the opera an elusiveness , a mysterious , shadowy spirituality that makes the pathos and tragedy of the drama poignant and real . The Maeterlinck drama that Debussy set to such exquisite music tells the story of Melisande , married to the considerably older Goland . Inevitably she falls in love with Golaud 's younger brother , Pelleas , and finally , in the scene that brings the opera to a climax , the two lovers cast aside their reserve and speak of their love without restraint . The jealous husband watches them , and in a fit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , Melisande dies after she has given birth to a child . The tragic story is unfolded , poetically and musically , with a touching tenderness that renders it a moving , delicately wrought love story motivated by authentically human emotions . In spite of the fact that Debussy made of the drama one of the operatic masterpieces of all time , Maeterlinck was openly hostile to the work . When it was produced at the Paris Opera-Comique , with Mary Garden as Melisande , an anonymous pamphlet denouncing the opera was distributed outside the opera house during the dress rehearsal . The authorship of this pamphlet was attributed to Maeterlinck . A few weeks before , the poet had published a letter in the magazine // Le Figaro in which he characterized Pelleas as " a work which is now strange and hostile to me , " and stated : " I can only wish its immediate and emphatic failure . " It was difficult to understand Maeterlinck 's attitude , but the generally accepted explanation was that Mary Garden had been chosen for the leading role , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After Pelleas et Melisande , Debussy 's next major work was the tone poem , La Mer , first performed in 1905 ; and then came the orchestral Itnages ( 1909-12 ) , which included Iberia . In later years Debussy composed the piano pieces that have become almost as standard in the concert repertoire as those of Chopin : the Suite Bergamasque ( 1890-1905 ) ; the Children 's Corner Suite ( 1906-08 ) ; the Preludes ( Book I , 1910 ; Book II , 1910-13 ) ; and the book of Etudes ( 1915 ) . Debussy 's most revolutionary break with tradition lay in his treatment of the individual chord as an independent unit . The science of harmony is concerned largely with the progression of chords , and its rules govern principally the passage from one chord to another . Debussy looked upon a chord as a color medium which could be entirely independ-ent of anything that came before it or followed it . Thus dis-sonance became an end in itself , and not merely a temporary disturbance of the ear that must be set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chords he had little thought of resolving them , for his chords were entities that he could arrange in any way his taste dictated . He could never understand why parallel consecutive fifths were forbidden . He liked the sound of them , even in his stu-dent days at the Conservatoire , and through his career he used them frequently . La Serenade interrompue , the ninth Prelude of Book I , has an interesting succession of parallel fifths : // Debussy 's use of parallel fifths was not always as modern as it seems ; sometimes it reverts to mediaeval practices . A number of Debussy 's progressions are exactly the same as those of ninth-century organum . In La Cathedrale engloutie , the composer paints a picture of a cathedral submerged in fathoms of water , and he gains a mystic , stately effect through the parallel motions of fourths and fifths , identical with organum : A similar progression is found in another of the Preludes , La Fille aux cheveux de lin ( The Girl with the Flaxen Hair ) : // Debussy 's use of ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work . The ninth chord , as we found in the preceding chapter , is formed by adding another tone to the seventh chord , the added tone being a third higher than the seventh ( see pages 50-51 ) . The ninth chord is distinguished by its questioning character , and if the chord is unresolved , the ear is left with an unsatisfied problem . The result is a shadowy impression ; cryptic , impenetra-ble . Ninth chords are characteristic , not only of Debussy 's music , but of the works of all impressionists . In The White Peacock , a piano piece by an American impressionist , Charles T. Griffes , an unresolved ninth chord suggests the languorous reserve , the detached hauteur of the proud peacock : // Parallel ninth chords give a peculiarly sliding effect , which has been used in recent years by arrangers of popular music . Ravel employed them effectively in his Pavane pour une in-fante de f unte : Another Debussyism is the use of the " whole-tone " scale . The whole-tone scale differs from the traditional diatonic scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by pro-gressing from step to step , or tone to tone , in equal intervals throughout its octave length . The diatonic scale , in either the major or minor mode , consists of unequal intervals ( see page 34 ) . In the notes forming the scale of C major on the piano keyboard , the intervals between E and r , and between B and C , are smaller than the others in the scale . // These half steps give the diatonic scale a definite shape , and lead to a definite resting place . The whole-tone scale is formed in this fashion : Since all the intervals , or spaces between the tones , are equal , there are no smaller intervals to establish a temporary or final resting place in a melody . Melodies built on the whole-tone scale are therefore vague and indefinite , and suggest mistiness and wraith-like shadows . The most consistent use Debussy made of the whole-tone scale is found in the second Prelude of Book I , Voiles . All except six measures of this piece are constructed on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devices that may be analyzed according to harmonic principles , Debussy and the other impressionists have added to their chords dissonant tones that can not be satisfactorily explained by analysis . They are apparently in-serted for the reason that the composers liked the sound they produced , or that they were necessary for the descriptive or atmospheric effect . Debussy and his disciples also experi-mented in what has become known as polytonality , or the // use of more than one key at the same time . These experiments were only preliminaries to the polytonal techniques , which are discussed in a later chapter , and they consisted chiefly of sudden modulations , or changes of key , which give the ear the impression of hearing the several keys , or tonalities , simultaneously . Sometimes chords in a key foreign to the passage are inserted , and give a similar effect . The impressionists also sought freedom and flexibility of rhythm . In Debussy 's first Prelude of Book I , Danseuses de Delphes , the time signature changes irregularly throughout the piece from ' % to ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , begins with a time signature of % . After the first thirty-one measures , the time signature changes with each measure : % , % , %s , as . Then the % continues for five measures , and is interrupted by a single measure in % . In the third movement of his Sonatine for piano , Ravel used alternately four different time signatures : % , 5/ , 4/ , and 2/. r . These are only a few of the basic methods Debussy and his followers have developed , and it must not be assumed that they represent the sum total of the impressionist technique . Nevertheless , the devices Debussy used are so distinctive and so readily recognized that they are perhaps more closely associated with his name than the idiom of any other composer . They have put his disciples at a considerable disadvantage , for when other composers use the whole-tone scale and ninth chords they often seem to be merely imitating their greater model . A composer who exerted a deep influence on Debussy was a fellow Frenchman , Erik Satie ( 1866-4925 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning a meager living as a pianist in a Montmartre cabaret . The two musicians struck up a close friendship , and would sit up for long hours after the cafe had closed , discussing their ideas and problems . These conversations did much to clarify Debussy 's ideas , // and it is said that it was Satie who first suggested to Debussy that he make an opera from Pelleas et Melisande . In his youth , Satie had little musical training . In 1883 he spent a miserable year at the Paris Conservatoire , but his rebellious nature and his love for sounds that others considered ugly made him leave his teachers before he finished his prescribed studie.fHe accordingly went his own way , and wrote unorthodox piano pieces to which he gave grotesque and satirical titles : Cold Pieces ; Pointed Arches ; Pieces in the Form of a Pear ; Unpleasant Glances ; and others equally absurd . This type of satire gained for Satie a wide reputation as a humorist , although the humor was more often in the titles than in the music . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handicapped by lack of training , and he entered the Schola Cantorum in Paris , where he studied with d'Indy and Roussel for three years . The rigid discipline to which Satie subjected himself did not , however , destroy his individuality . In a way , Satie was a crusader . He was against anything in music that took itself too seriously ; he lampooned anybody or anything that smacked of what we today would call " stuffshirtedness . " Consequently he avoided whatever seemed impressive , and by writing in a naively simple manner he caused his detractors to call him trifling and trivial . Despite the wide reputation he enjoyed in his day , Satie has proved more important for his influence than for his own works , although the latter are in vogue again as this is written ( 1956 ) . He not only helped Debussy ; he was also a factor in the development of other composers , particularly Virgil Thomson and the so-called " Group of Six " who are discussed in a later chapter . There are many other composers who either had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his disciples by be66 MODERN MUSIC coming impressionists . Paul Dukas ( 1865 ? 1935 ) , the French composer known principally for his orchestral scherzo L'Apprenti sorcier , was , like Debussy , far removed from the realism that was so prevalent during his youth . His work was marked by symbolism , and a typically French delicacy of sentiment . Florent Schmitt , born in 1870 and currently in eclipse outside of France , is perhaps more grandiose than Debussy in his larger works , but in his chamber music he is distinctly an impressionist . Next to Debussy , Maurice Ravel ( 1875 ? 1937 ) has perhaps been the most widely performed of modern French composers . Certainly , his Bolero , for orchestra , has achieved a vogue that has had few competitors . In a number of his works Ravel undeniably used methods that have characterized the impressionists ; but it is not only as an impressionist that we shall meet Ravel . Unlike Debussy , he remained fundamentally a classicist , even though he adopted modern methods and was something of an experimenter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , and although he made frequent use of the ninth chord , he was more fond of the chord of the eleventh . Also , as we shall discover in Chapter 7 , he was often a polytonalist . England has produced a number of impressionists . Frederick Delius . ( 1862 ? 1934 ) , like Debussy , was more closely akin to poets and painters than to musicians . A number of his early years were spent in America , on an orange grove in Florida , and he once remarked to his biographer , Eric Fenby , that through sitting and gazing at nature in our subtropics he gradually learned the way in which he would eventually find himself . IIe evolved a style distinctly his own , aimed not so much at movement and action as at sensuous meditation . Cy1 Scott ( b. 1879 ) is distinctly impressionistic in the delicate tints of his harmonic structure ; in fact , some of his piano pieces and songs won Debussy 's // praise . Interest in Scott , however , has waned considerably in recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1879-1941 ) , Gustav Hoist ( 1874-1934 ) , John Ireland ( b. 1879 ) , Eugene Goossens ( b. 1893 ) , who has been active chiefly as a conductor for many years , and Ralph Vaughan Williams ( b. 1872 ) , who is today considered the dean of British composers . Williams showed the influence of French impressionism in his early works . Later he came to be more identified with the movement that aspired to weld folk songs into a truly British idiom . His most popular works are the ubiquitous Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis ( 1910 ) , the London Symphony ( No. 2 ) , and the gigantic Sixth Symphony of 1947-48 . Incidentally , Benjamin Britten was a student of both Bridge and Ireland . Born in 1913 , he has been a prolific composer since a very early age , having completed an oratorio at nine . Stylistically he defies classification , for he is ever " eclectic but not without savor , " as Virgil Thomson once put it . Virtually all of his mature works have been performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success excepting certain of his numerous songs , the diverting Young Person 's Guide to the Orchestra ( 1945 ) , and the sensitively felt settings of Rimbaud collectively entitled Les Illuminations ( 1939 ) . The latter two are familiar to American ballet-goers as the music for Fanfare and Illuminations . Britten 's many works for the lyric theater include Paul Bunyan , Albert Herring , The Rape of Lucretia , Peter Grimes , The Turn of the Screw , Billy Budd , and Gloriana . In Italy the leading impressionist was the late Ottorino Respighi ( 1879-1936 ) , with his symphonic poems , Pines of Rome , Fountains of Rome , and Roman Festivals , G. Francesco Malipiero ( 1882- ) , and Alfredo Casella ( 1883-1947 ) . The latter is discussed at more length in the chapter // on Neoclassicism . Spain has had Isaac Albeniz ( 1860-1909 ) , composer of atmospheric piano pieces ( the suite Iberia , a Tango in D , Seguidillas , and others ) , and Manuel de Falla ( 1876-1946 ) whose operas La Vida Breve and El Sombrero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known through orchestral performances of their dances . Falla was definitely influenced by the modern French school in his orchestral technique . Poland 's leading impressionist was Karol Szymanowski ( 1882-1937 ) , who was interested in oriental philosophy and mysticism ; while Hungary has given us Zoltan Kodaly ( 1882 ) , famous for his comic opera nary Janos and for his impressionistic piano music . In his Epitaphe , for piano , Kodaly uses a modified form of organum . Alexander Scriabin ( 1872-1915 ) , the Russian , started his composing career as a romantic follower of Chopin and Liszt , but as he developed , he shared with Debussy the feeling that the accepted harmonic intervals were not enough to express the modern composer 's ideas . Consequently , he too made use of the upper intervals of the eleventh , the thirteenth , and some even higher . He also foreshadowed the atonalists , who are discussed in the following chapter , by arbitrarily building chords in fourths , rather than in thirds . Thus , two piano pieces of his Opus 57 are based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and E. In his orchestral tone poem Prometheus , his so-called " mystic " chord is a combination of five fourths , formed by C , F sharp , B flat , E , A , and D. Scriabin was born in Moscow . He studied at the Moscow Conservatory ( piano with Safonov and composition with Taneiev ) , and aroused the interest of the publisher , Belaiev , who not only issued his works on generous terms , but also sponsored an extended European concert tour in which the programs consisted largely of Scriabin 's own composi- // tions . Later , in 1908 , Scriabin enjoyed the patronage of Sergei Koussevitzky , who at the time was head of the Russian Music Publishing Society . This organization offered him a substantial yearly retainer , and Koussevitzky engaged him for a tour of the Volga cities with his orchestra . As a composer , Scriabin passed through definitely marked stages of development . At the start , he was strongly influenced by Chopin , and being an excellent pianist himself , he naturally composed a long list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly the etudes and the preludes . About the turn of the century he began to evolve his more advanced style , and the harmonic structure of his works became widely discussed . For a time he ranked with Debussy as a symbol of modernism , particularly when he came under the influence of a theosophy circle in Brussels in 1908-10 , and the mystic strain in his music became more pronounced . His major works reflect this influence , and show him seeking an essential relation between art and religion . In Prometheus ( 1909 ? 10 ) he conceived an affinity , spiritual as well as scientific , between tone and color , and he made provision for prescribed colors to be thrown on a screen while the music was being performed . The work was only once performed in this manner , however ; at Carnegie Hall , New York , in 1915 . The results were not sufficiently convincing to warrant repetition . Scriabin 's ardent desire to achieve a perfect snythesis of the arts for the service of religion led him to plan a so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for he died with only the sketches outlined for the introductory movement . Aside from Prometheus , Scriabin 's best-known orchestral work is the Poem of Ecstasy , composed in 1907-08 . This symphony , so called , is intended by the composer to set forth the " Joy of Creative Activity . " The two basic motives // of the Prologue symbolize the composer 's " Striving after the Ideal , " and a gradual " Awakening of the Soul . " Later themes represent " Human Love " and the " Will to Rise . " Concert performances of both Prometheus and the Poem of Ecstasy are becoming less frequent in these times , although Scriabin 's music lends itself so ideally to " hi-fi " treatment that he is reasonably well represented today in the recording catalogues . In some respects it is difficult to understand why they should not be played more often in concert halls , for they are filled with passages of strange loveliness and mystical effects that seem magic . It may be that harmonically Scriabin stuck too closely to the formulas he devised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a flexible idiom . Certainly , his harmonies were as bold and daring in their day as those of Debussy , but Debussy rarely allowed his chordal innovations to overshadow his musical and poetic message . Another Russian to show a kinship with the impressionists was Vladimir Rebikov ( 1866-1920 ) , a native of Siberia , who graduated from the influence of his countryman , Tchaikovsky , and was one of the first composers to use the whole-tone scale . Rebikov has been called the father of Russian modernism . Oddly enough , he has been almost totally forgotten in recent years . Dozens of composers in the United States have been influenced by French impressionism at one time or another in their careers . The shimmering , sparkling color of the works of Charles Martin Loeffler ( 1861 ? 1935 ) make him a close ally of the impressionists . He was profoundly absorbed with . Gregorian plain song , and the church modes of the Middle Ages . The haunting , brooding strains of his Pagan Poem are like strange incense . Charles Tomlinson Griffes ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life the most definitely impressionistic composer we // have yet produced in this country . Although he was at first definitely under the influence of his German teachers , he came to lean toward the modern French school . In his piano works : the Tone Pictures ( The Lake at Evening ; The Vale of Dreams ; The Night Winds ) and the Roman Sketches ( The White Peacock ; Nightfall ; The Fountain of the Acqua Paola ; Clouds ) he was distinctly a Debussy disciple . His reverence for Ravel exceeded his admiration of Debussy , but he delighted so much in individual chord combinations , dependent on nothing that goes before or follows them , and he had such a predilection for modes and Oriental scales , that his kinship with Debussy was complete . In his early years , Louis Gruenberg ( 1884 ) was decidedly impressionistic , particularly in the piano pieces , Opus 3 ? The Temple of Isis ; The Sacrifice ; Dance of the Veiled Women ; Night ; The Flame Dance of Isis . John Alden Carpenter ( 1876 ? 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressionist patterns in his early songs and in the orchestral suite , Adventures in a Perambulator . It should be noted , however , that when Carpenter first experimented with these devices , he had not heard a single note of Debussy 's music . Ernest Bloch ( 1880 ) has had his impressionist moments , too , even though he has gone far beyond the commonly accepted devices by experimenting with quarter tones in his Quintet for Piano and Strings . Forty years ago to be a modernist was almost inevitably to be an impressionist . Yet , beautiful and delicate as the effects the impressionists gave us have been , they have proved too fragile , too ephemeral , to stand the excessive use to which they were put . The more obvious of them wore themselves out chiefly because they could be adopted so easily ; some of them became cliches useful to anyone who could put notes on paper . Even some of Debussy 's works have not worn too well . As Aaron Copland has written : " It // is his sentimental side that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite his musical iconoclasm , De bussy was the hedonistic poet of a thoroughly bourgeois world . There is something cushioned and protected , some-thing velvety-soft and overcomfortable about his music . It reflects a span of life when Europe thought itself most secure , between the years of 1870 and 1914 . One wonders what the eventual fate of this music will be in the uncertain world ahead . A time may come when it will seem over-refined , de-cadent , effeminate . But , " Copland is careful to add , " no world that we can foresee would ever wish to do without Debussy 's music when he is at his best . At such times he is matchlessly poetic and touching and sensitive . " 1 MODERN DEVICES IN MUSIC GENERALLY HAVE BEEN A DEVELOPment and extension of something that has existed before . Debussy 's ninth and eleventh chords were the simpler chords of earlier composers to which further tones were added at regular intervals . Wagner 's chromaticism was a freer passing from one key to another . The liberties Schumann and Chopin took with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , this evolutionary process has in general followed scientific acoustic principles , even though the innovations were developed by trial and error rather than by laboratory methods . This explains why atonality is the most difficult of all modern systems for the layman to understand and accept , for it represents a sharp break with what has gone before and what has been developed by slow process . It discards all previous rules and conventions , and starting with the twelve tones of the scale , sets up an entirely new system . It is not fair to assume that atonal composers have written the way they do haphazardly , or that they compose differently merely because they have not had the patience to master the technique of their craft . To the novice it seems that the same effect could be gained by taking a brush filled with ink and spattering it on a fresh page of music paper . Perhaps the result would be no more difficult to perform or listen to , but the works of the leading atonalists are produced with as much thought and labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever drawbacks atonal music may possess generally result from an overscientific approach , rather than from any lack of workmanship . The history of atonality is learned best through the career of its leading exponent , Arnold Schoenberg ( 1874-1951 ) . A native of Vienna , Schoenberg did not decide to be a professional musician until he was sixteen years of age . He had been a devoted amateur , and had enjoyed playing in chamber music ensembles , sometimes composing violin duets , trios , and quartets for the groups he played with . He showed some of his compositions to a Vienna musician named Alexander von Zemlinsky , a friend of Brahms , and Zemlinsky gave Schoenberg the only instruction he ever had , for he was mostly self-taught . In 1902 Zemlinsky remarked of his pupil : " He knows more than I do now , and what he does not know , he feels . He has a brilliant and an inquiring mind . And he has the greatest amount of sincerity . " 1 Meanwhile Schoenberg had been supporting himself by making orchestrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a Vienna cafe . His own compositions in this period included his famous Verklarte Nacht ( Transfigured Night ) , first composed for string sextet , and later scored for string orchestra ; and a symphonic poem for orchestra , Pelleas and Melisande . He had also started his Gurre-Lieder , for chorus and orchestra , but the necessity of earning a living kept him from com pleting it until 1911 . In Verklarte Nacht , Schoenberg showed himself to be a mixture of postromanticist and impressionist . Having grown up in the midst of the German tradition , he was naturally filled with the intensity of feeling that marked the works of Wagner and the later Bruckner , Mahler , and Strauss . For a // time Schoenberg gave full expression to this emotionalism , and the tonal beauty of his Transfigured Night bathes it in a loveliness that is shimmering and starry . His " inquiring mind , " however , was not satisfied . Like Debussy , Schoenberg felt himself enslaved and shackled by his Wagnerian inheritance , and he determined to be a free man artistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the only way he could be free was to break entirely with tradition , to evolve something that would be altogether new , a musical speech that would have in it nothing of the past . And what he devised has compelled the listener , as well as the composer , to revise completely his viewpoint toward music and his conception of tonal beauty and effectiveness . Opposition arose immediately . When Schoenberg 's early works in a new idiom were first performed ( the Chamber Symphony and the String Quartet in D minor ) the hostile demonstration was so violent that Gustav Mahler stepped to the platform and begged the audience to listen to the rest of the concert . Later , when the Second String Quartet was introduced by the Rose Quartet , the audience again became riotous . In spite of hostility , Schoenberg continued his course , and finally perfected his atonal system with his rive Piano Pieces , Opus 23 . In these his principles are rigidly applied , more consistently than in his earlier piano pieces or in his melodramatic chamber music composition Pierrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schoenberg was active as a teacher , giving lessons in conventional harmony and counterpoint , as well as gathering together a group of atonal disciples . In 1933 he came to the United States , and made his home in this country until his death . A literal definition of atonality would be " an absence of the relationship of all the tones and chords to a central // keynote . " 2 Thus it is the opposite of tonality , which , of course , is the principle of key in music , or , to quote Webster : " the character which a composition has by virtue of the relationship of all its tones and chords to the keynote , or tonic . " In tonal music , a passage in C major revolves about the tone of C , and the ear finds rest and satisfaction when the tone of C , and the chord that has it for its root , are sounded at the close . Instead of having for its basis the major or minor scale of C , or any other key , atonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every chromatic tone within the compass of an octave , in other words , the tones represented by all the black and white keys on the piano keyboard . This twelve-tone scale differs from the chromatic scale , however , for in tonal music , the chromatic scale is in effect composed of seven scale degrees and five auxiliary tones . In the key of C , the white keys on the piano represent the seven scale degrees , and the black keys the five auxiliary tones . In tonal music each of the twelve degrees is of equal importance . Instead of having one central key-tone , an atonal passage has twelve independent tonal centers , each having a separate relationship to each of the eleven other tones . Thus , a piece may begin on any of the twelve tones , singly or in combination with any of the others , and may end on any tone or chord combination the composer chooses . The exponents of atonality resent the term . They claim that their music is not lacking in tonality ; far from it , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say , be called " twelve-toned , " rather than " atonal " music . Some of them call it " pantonal . " Nevertheless , the terms " atonality " and " atonal music " have been firmly fixed in the // popular vocabulary . Specialists are by now inured to the indiscriminate use of the terms by nonspecialists . One of the basic principles of atonal music is condensa tion of material . In striving , o free himself from Wagnerian heroics , Schoenberg felt that there must be no high-flown , long-extended passages in his music . Nor must there be the flowing development sections that composers like Beetho ven made an indispensable part of their symphonies . Hence Schoenberg would be laconic , almost monosyllabic in his new music , and he wrote piano pieces a single page in length , some of them containing as few as nine measures each . He explained this need for brevity in a lecture he de-livered in Paris in 1911 . " Relinquishment of tonality , " he said , " implies a corresponding relinquishment of the struc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore early examples of works written by means of twelve notes between which no other relationship exists than their relation to one another were necessarily very brief . " 3 Another fundamental principle is the avoidance of con sonant combinations , and a rigid insistence on dissonant chords , unrelieved by anything in the way of a simple three-toned triad in thirds , or even a seventh or ninth chord . Thus , atonal music must be written with extreme care to avoid any combinations that would be pleasing to the ear of the man who likes his music sweet . It can not be composed hap hazardly , but requires mathematical and studied exactness to produce an uninterrupted succession of harsh sounds . In his 1911 lecture Schoenberg discussed this necessity for dissonance : " It is likely that , for a time at least , consonant chords will have to disappear from music if the tonal prin78 MODERN MUSIC ciple is eliminated ? not for physical reasons , but for reasons of economy . . . . A tonal consonance asserts its claims on everything that follows it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consonant chords tend to occupy an excessive amount of room , and might disturb the balance proper to the new scheme ? unless some way is found either of satisfying or of suppressing the requirements of such chords . " In other words , pleasant sounds are objectionable because they can not stand alone as well as dissonances can , so if atonal composers are going to write short pieces , they must avoid consonances . One of the methods used to produce dissonances has been the construction of chords in fourths , rather than in thirds : This method of chord construction , we have found , was also used by Scriabin . Schoenberg , however , has proceeded toward his goal more mathematically and scientifically . The atonalists also avoid doubling any tone of a chord : in other words , each tone sounded must be different from the others ? a four-tone chord must have four separate tones ; one of them can not be the same tone as another either in unison or in another octave . And better yet , each tone in a chord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C matched by a C sharp or C flat ; a G by a G sharp or a G flat , etc . Construction of atonal music follows well-defined patterns . The rules of the system are as strict and rigid as any of those that limit the student of conventional harmony and // counterpoint . If anything , the atonal rules are stricter . The fundamental basis of an atonal piece is known as the " row , " or the succession of tones on which the composition is built . It is not accurate to speak of this row as a melody , or theme , for its succession of tones is subjected to such drastic alterations that it soon becomes unrecognizable to the average listener . The avowed purpose of the row is to establish and reveal the relations between the several tones used . Variations of the series are then employed to increase the number and variety of these relationships . The first rule is that all the tones of the twelve-tone scale must be sounded before any of them is heard for the second time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important than the others . If C should be sounded twice , the listener might get the idea that the piece is written in the key of C. Once the complete row is announced , the piece continues in a manner similar to the variation form , and the row is subjected to a variety of manipulations and alterations . The intervals between tones may be made narrower or wider ( shorter or longer skips and jumps ) ; the intervals may remain the same , but the rhythm changed , elongated or contracted ; some tones may be omitted and others added . Two of the patterns for altering the twelve-tone row have descriptive names : Vhe " mirror " and the " crab . " The mirror is what its name implies , an inversion , or turning of the row upside down . When the skip from tone to tone represents an upward interval , the mirrored inversion presents the same interval in the opposite direction , or downward the same number of scale degrees . In the " crab " pattern the row is sung or played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , backward . It starts with the last tone of the row , and then offers the whole series in reverse . The two patterns , the // mirror and the crab , may also be combined , and the row played backward and upside down , simultaneously . Atonal music might thus be described as music that may be played forward , backward , right side up , or upside down . As far as upside down is concerned , much of Bach 's music is so constructed that it is highly effective when inverted in mirror fashion . An experiment in this direction was once tried with a player-piano roll of the second Prelude and Fugue from Volume I of the Well-Tempered Clavichord . The roll was turned so that the holes for the top notes would be at the bottom , and those for the low notes at the top , on the spool , and started . The result was delightful . The rhythms , of course , remained the same ; but the bass became the treble and the treble became the bass . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhill . The entire work was so horizontally constructed that its outlines were as well defined in the inversion , and as melodically interesting , as they were in the accustomed position . But to return to atonality . It is possible to grasp some idea of its underlying principles from verbal description , but the reader who wants to consider them visually and aurally will be interested in excerpts from one of Schoenberg 's pieces . The following measures are taken from the fifth and last number of Opus 23 , and they show some of the variations to which the twelve-tone row is subjected . The piece is entitled Walzer ; an almost ironic title , if you try to waltz to the music . There is , of course , no key signature , and the twelve-tone row is set forth in the opening measure . If you examine it carefully , you will find that no tone in the upper part is repeated . Then look at the lower part , and you will find that it , too , has twelve tones , each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the opening motive ( the first five tones of the upper part ) is changed by having its rhythm rearranged . You will notice , also , that once more all twelve tones are sounded , and none repeated : // In a few measures the five-tone motive takes this form : A clear example of the mirror technique is found in a piece by an American composer , Gerald Strang , which is descriptively entitled Mirrorrorrim . This is not a strictly atonal work ; it is cited merely to show how musical passages may be inverted : and is woven , horizontally , to the same motive arranged upside down and backward : // The title incidentally is a " palindrome , " reading the same backward as forward , and the entire piece in addition to its mirrored inversions may be reversed and played backward from the end to the beginning . The sequence of notes is the same in either direction . At this point the layman is entitled to ask the pertinent question : how much of this is art , and how much mathematics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reason for being is emotional as well as intellectual , exactly how expressive a medium is atonal music ? It is doubtful that any system that limits itself so strictly and so arbitrarily to prescribed patterns can achieve unlimited expressive powers . Schoenberg himself came to realize this , for he publicly stated that when his stem had become fully developed and the music lover 's ear had become accustomed to the new tonal relationships , consonances might be reintroduced with safety . They will have to be included if atonal music is to have the flexibility and variety essential to any true work of art . Expressiveness depends so much on contrast that if the means of gaining contrast are denied the artist he can not hope to convey his message . In the visual arts there are light and shade as well as colors ; in prose and verse there is variety of mood and pace . // In tonal music there are a number of possible contrasts . Rhythmically , a composition may be played slowly or rapidly . Dynamically , it may be performed loudly or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments affords a variety of pitch from the highest tones to the lowest . The mood color of tonal music may be established , and altered , by the use of major and minor modes , while the sharpest contrasts of all are achieved by the interplay of consonance and dissonance . Atonal music shares with tonal music only a few of these opportunities for contrast . It may be performed rapidly or slowly , loudly or softly . Its tones may be written in high registers or low . With these possibilities the similarity ends , for atonal music sacrifices the contrasts of major or minor , and of consonance and dissonance . Aaron Copland ventured a shrewd opinion on the future of atonal music . " Actually , " he once wrote , " it is rather difficult to foresee what the future has in store for most music written in the atonal idiom . Already it begins to sound surprisingly dated , hopelessly bound to the period of the twenties when it was first played extensively . No doubt we are badly placed to judge it at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fairly , one can even now see certain inherent weaknesses ; for whatever reasons , atonal music resembles itself too much . It creates a certain monotony of effect that severely limits its variety of expression . It has been said that the atonal system can not produce folk songs or lullabies . But more serious is the fact that , being the expression of a highly refined and subtle musical culture , it has very little for a naive but expanding musical culture such as is characteristic today of the United States ( or the Soviet Union ) . This is not to deny its historical significance or its importance as an advanced outpost in the technicological field of musical experiment . But for a long time to come // it is likely to be of interest principally to specialists and con noisseurs rather than to the generality of music lovers . " 4 It is of course true that some highly expressive music has been created in the atonal pattern . In our chapter on Dis sonance we remarked that the discords so revolutionary at the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Strauss 's Elektra . Similarly , the granitic , brittle sounds of atonal music seem well suited to such subjects as those of the two operas of the late Alban Berg ( 1885 ? 1935 ) , Schoenberg 's favorite pupil and disciple . The first of these operas , Wozzeck , tells of a down-trodden , psychopathic soldier who stabs his unfaithful mistress and then commits suicide by drowning . The second , Lulu , offers a conception of womanhood that is expressed by the libret tist , Frank Wedekind , in a few lines from the Prologue : She was created to instigate harm , To lure , to seduce , to poison To murder ? without anyone 's noticing . Berg first met his teacher , Schoenberg , in 1904 , and in 1913 Schoenberg conducted a concert in Vienna which pre sented Berg 's first orchestral work , Five Orchestral Songs to Picture-Postcard Texts by Peter Altenberg . The pi4erformance caused one of the most notorious concert scandals that even Vienna had witnessed . The audience rioted so violently that the program had to be cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced at the State Opera in Berlin in 1924 . Ten years later Berg finished a tentative version of Lulu in which the vocal parts were completely worked out but the orchestration merely sketched . Up to the time of his death he worked on the instru mentation , and finished all but the last two thirds of the third // act . He arranged a set of Five Symphonic Pieces from the score of Lulu , which was performed in Berlin on November 30 , 1934 . Less than a month later he died of blood poisoning , and the scoring of the Lulu 's last act was never completed by the composer . The first two acts were performed in 1937 at Zurich . Lulu was not finished because the composer interrupted its composition during the Spring of 1935 to write a violin concerto . This work had been suggested to him by an Amer ican violinist , Louis Krasner . Berg was still considering the form the proposed work should take , when late in the Spring of 1935 he was saddened by the death of a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he completed in a few months his Violin Concerto in the form of a requiem for the young girl . It proved to be his own requiem as well , for it was not until the April following the composer 's death that Krasner played it at the International Society for Con-temporary Music Festival at Barcelona ( 1936 ) . In 1930 Schoenberg remarked of Berg that he was proud that he had been able " to guide this great talent into the proper channels : towards the superb fulfillment of its in dividual potentialities , towards the greatest independence . But those qualities of mind and character which were indis pensable for all this were innate in him and were in evidence at the very first lesson . " 6 More , perhaps , than any others of the atonalists , Schoen-berg included , Berg actually used the atonal technique as a medium for a truly artistic , creative expression . It is true that the emotions and thoughts expressed by his music , par ticularly in his operas , are morbid and terrifying ; but the music is exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional experience . In addition , there are moments that are sensuous and lyrical . Schoenberg 's tribute to Alban Berg contained an acknowledgment to another of his famous pupils , Anton von Webern , who was also a native of Vienna ( 1883 ? 1945 ) : " Were not he Berg , and our mutual friend and his fellow pupil , Anton von Webern , the greatest credit to my influence as a teacher , and were not these two my support in times of greatest stress ; for who could find anything better on this earth than their loyalty , steadfastness , and love ? " 6 Von Webern 's works include compositions for orchestra , chamber music , and songs . He regarded most literally the stipulation that atonalism calls for condensation and brevity , and as a result his pieces are brief to the point of monosyllabic terseness . Works of several movements require only a few minutes for performance ; yet many persons consider his music sensitive and perceptive . Those who make a life study of atonalism are often scholars as well as musicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Vienna University , while another Schoenberg disciple and pupil , Egon Wellesz ( Vienna , 1885 ) , won a Ph.D . in 1908 , and is a musicologist and music historian as well as a composer . Wellesz is an authority on Byzantine music , and the author of a two-volume work on The New Instrumentation . In addition to writing scholarly treatises , he is the composer of a long list of works : operas , ballets , orchestral compositions , and songs . America has produced several atonalists . Prominent among them is Adolph Weiss ( 1891 ) who studied with Schoenberg in Vienna . Schoenberg , however , said that Weiss was too independent a personality to be called his pupil . Weiss uses the twelve-tone row technique , liberally if not exclub Ibid. // lively . In his Sonata for Flute and Viola he subjects his row to the mirror and crab alterations , and combines them simultaneously . His Piano Preludes provide excellent study material for the student of strict atonalism . In his Kammersymphonie Weiss builds the entire work on two intervals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wallingford Riegger ( Albany , Georgia , 1885 ) has been an avowed atonalist in such of his works as A Study in Sonority , for ten violins or any multiple thereof ; Three Canons for Woodwinds ( 1930 ) ; Bacchanale and Evocation ( 1931 ) , and others more recent . His most important recent work is the Third Symphony of 1948 ; a strictly written twelve-tone piece , it is nevertheless intensely romantic in conception . Riegger also was a pioneer in writing music for the modern dance , and believes that it is more valid and effective for the composer to write music after the choreography has been designed than it is for the dancer to interpret a previously composed piece of music . Among the many other composers within or near the perimeter of the atonal orbit might be mentioned Elliott Carter ( New York City , 1908 ) , Stepan Wolpe ( Germany , 1902 ) , Ben Weber ( St. Louis , 1916 ) , Leon Kirchner ( Brooklyn , 1919 ) , and Lou Harrison ( Portland , Oregon , 1917 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then , including the decidedly nonatonal Aaron Copland , for example , in his Piano Quartet . POLYTONALITY IS THE OPPOSITE OF ATONALITY . WHILE THE atonalists forego entirely the use of any definite key , the polytonalists write their music in two or more keys at the same time . Most of them , however , content themselves with two at a time . A number of years ago , when radio was an infant , one of the authors of this book was present at an event that gives a clear idea of what polytonality is , or might be . The Hungarian composer-pianist , Ernst von Dohnanyi , was to give a short recital of his own compositions on a local station in Philadelphia . That was before the day of networks , scripts written in advance , and split-second schedules . It was the author 's duty to go to Philadelphia with Dohnanyi , see to it that he found his way to the studio , and look after him generally . They had dinner together before the broadcast , and the writer suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it help matters if he told something about the pieces Dohnanyi was to play ? Accordingly , he took from his pocket an old envelope and jotted down what Dohnanyi told him . The first selection would be the Rhapsody in C minor , so he wrote : " Rhapsody , C minor . " Next came his Marche humoresque . This is a tricky piece built entirely over what is known as a " basso ostinato , " or literally in English , an " obstinate bass " that refuses to change through the whole length of the piece . A little four-note figure in the left hand // continues its way , constantly repeated and unchanged , from beginning to end . The author asked Dohnanyi what these four notes were , and he replied : " E flat , D , C , B flat . " So he wrote on the envelope : " Marche humoresque  --  E flat , D , C , B flat . " When they arrived at the studio , they found that the resident announcer had no intention of letting any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurriedly explained what he had planned to say about the pieces . He gave him the envelope , and told him about the Rhapsody in C minor and the bass figure in the March humoresque . He showed him where he had written the names of the notes ? E flat , D C , and B flat , and then went to the piano and played them . Soon it was time for the recital . The announcer introduced Dohnanyi with a rousing pep talk , and , consulting the envelope said : " Mr. Dohnanyi 's first piece is one he wrote himself ; his Rhapsody in ? er ? " looking at the envelope again , " C minor . " At the end of the Rhapsody , the announcer came to the microphone . " Mr. Dohnanyi will now play another piece he wrote himself : his Marche humoresque , in ? er ? er , " hurriedly looking at the envelope , " E flat , D , C , and B flat . " When the recital was over , Dohnanyi wiped his forehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be modern a little ; but not so much as to write in four keys at once . " " Unlike atonality , polytonality is not a system that requires detailed explanation , nor one that has a code of rules to govern its use . It is merely a practice of combining two or more tonalities , or keys , in any manner the composer wishes , and it is used in varying degrees by almost every presentday composer . There is , therefore , no group or cult of polytonalists , although some composers have made more extensive use of polytonal combinations than others . In certain respects , polytonality is an extension and de- // velopment of traditional devices that go back to the eighteenth century . It may be said to have its origin in a timehonored device known as " organ point , " sometimes called " pedal point . " Organ point consists of the holding or repetition of one tone , generally in the bass , while the other voices , or instrumental parts , continue their melodic and harmonic progress , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organ or pedal point generally begins and ends at places where it harmonizes satisfactorily with the other parts . The following example of organ point is taken from the closing measures of a Bach fugue : No. 2 in the first volume of the Well-Tempered Clavichord . Bach made extensive use of organ point , generally toward the close of his compositions , where it would add to the // summing-up effect that establishes the idea of finality . The drone of bagpipes and the sustained tone of the musette are actually organ points . As music has developed and its resources increased , composers have come to use more than one tone in organ point fashion . Often a whole chord of three or more tones is sustained , or repeated , while the other voices or instruments will sometimes pass into other keys before returning to a chord combination consonant with the multiple organ point . In this way polytonality is momentarily produced . Still another forerunner of modern polytonality is a device that may be called polyharmony , and is merely the sounding together of two different chords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hearers two tones of a dissonant chord and the tones of its resolution at the same time . The difference between polyharmony and polytonality is easily understood by realizing that in polyharmony both chords may be spelled , or analyzed , in the same key . In the following combination : the chord in the bass is the basic chord of C major . Although the upper chord could be considered the basic chord of G major , it is also one of the chords of C major , so that both chords belong to the key of C. Thus they produce polyharmony. // In the next combination , however : while the chord in the bass is again the fundamental chord of C major , the chord in the treble ( upper part ) , with its C sharp , could not possibly be in that key , or in any other key to which the lower chord might belong . Therefore , no matter how the chords are analyzed , they are in different keys and polytonality results when they are sounded together . In the chapter on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polytonality in the last bars of Also sprach Zarathustra . In that passage , composed in 1890 , the basses sound the tones of the C major chord , and in the next measure the upper strings and wood winds play the B major chord . The two chords are not heard together , it is true , but the upper chord is sounded while the ear still retain " ' ' " s'the impression of the bass chord . Thus , the effect is distinctly polytonal , as though both were being sounded at the same time . We have also learned that the impressionists inserted chords that are foreign to the underlying key of the passage in which they occur . Debussy 's Prelude , Canope , contains chords in so many different keys that the ear gets the impression of several being played at once , even though each is sounded separately . It is sometimes claimed ? but incorrectly , as we will show ? that Igor Stravinsky was the first , in 1911 , to make significant use of polytonality in his ballet music for Petrouchka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MODERN MUSIC tion , represents two different keys , F sharp major and C major , sounded simultaneously : Maurice Ravel explored the possibilities of polytonality with interesting results , yet he could never be accused of adopting any device merely to produce dissonant sounds . He was too much of a creative artist to use any pattern mechanically for its own sake , and when he employed polytonal combinations he did so because they enhanced his truly musical effects . Polytonality intensified the colors on his musical tone palette , and heightened the sensuous glamour of his scores . As early as 1912 , a year after Stravinsky produced Petrouchka , Ravel was experimenting with polytonality in his Valses nobles et sentianentales . In the opening measures of Valse No. 6 , the upper wood winds play tones that are definitely in the key of D major . At the same time the upper strings and the horns are playing in B major , while the bass instruments play in C major . Thus we hear three tonalities at the same time : C , B , and D. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E major and F major . Polytonality is often considered largely a French product , not because Ravel used it , but because it is so closely identified with the works of Darius Milhaud ( 1892 ) , and the so-called Parisian Group of Six , which included , besides Milhaud , five other French composers : Arthur Honegger ( 1892-4955 ) , Francis Poulenc ( 1899 ) , Georges Auric // ( 1899 ) , Germaine Tailleferre ( 1892 ) , and Louis Durey ( 1888 ) . Les Six came into prominence shortly after the first World War , and became known as " Les Nouveaux Jeunes . " For a literary spokesman , the members chose Jean Cocteau , and as musical sponsor , the eccentric Erik Satie . Under the name of " Les Six Francais " the group achieved considerable notoriety and became the subject of many discussions and controversies . The six composers led a reaction against the " eloquence " of Cesar Franck , the impressionism of Debussy , and what they termed the " scholasticism " of Vincent d'Indy . They adopted American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , however , they lost their impetus and their identity as a group , and only two of them , Milhaud and Honegger , have retained the prominence they enjoyed as members of the radical Les Six . Milhaud makes consistent use of polytonality . Perhaps this arises from , or at least explains , his kinship with the other members of Les Six , who , in reacting from Debussy 's sensuousness , went headlong after brutal dissonance , as well as vivid colors and strong rhythms , turning their backs on anything hinting at sentiment . Milhaud had the conventional training at the Paris Conservatoire , under Gedalge , Widor , and d'Indy , and by the time he joined Les Six he had already composed a large amount of chamber music : four string quartets , two violin and piano sonatas , and a Sonata for Piano , Flute , Oboe , and Clarinet ; orchestral music ; a ballet ; and incidental music to three dramas by Claudel . The Sonata for Flute , Oboe , Clarinet , and Piano , composed in 1918 , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oboe , and clarinet start in F major , and the flute enters with a passage in C major . Later , when the piano shifts to F sharp major , the flute continues in C major . When Milhaud associated with Les Six , he adopted jazz // as wholeheartedly as any of his colleagues . In 1923 he com-pleted his ballet , La Creation du monde . This work , based on a scenario by Blaise Cendrars , deals with the creation of the world according to African legends . Jazz rhythms and blue notes permeate the entire score , all in various tonalities superimposed one on the other . Jazz subjects provide the basis for several fugues . It is interesting to observe that La Creation du monde was produced a year before George Gershwin composed his Rhapsody in Blue . Milhaud 's stage works include the ballet Les Songes ; the operas Christoph Colomb and Le Pauvre Matelot ; and a number of others , including a group of so-called " minute-operas " that last no longer than eight minutes each . His list of orchestral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compositions for solo piano and orchestra , and three for violin and orchestra . The Piano Concerto ( 1934 ) is distinctly polytonal . In the opening pages the orchestra plays in D major , and the solo piano in E major . Notwithstanding his love of dissonance , which sometimes becomes downright cacophony , Milhaud is one of the most lyrically expressive of modern composers . His product is de-cidedly uneven , however , and he has adopted a bewildering variety of styles and idioms . His humor is often crude , par-ticularly when he decides to set a florist 's catalog to music for voice and orchestra . Milhaud 's symphonies have enjoyed a certain popularity in America , but among his orchestral works only the rhyth-mically rowdy ballet Le Boeuf sur le toit ( 1919 ) , Suite provencale ( 1936 ) , and Suite francaise ( 1942 ) continue in the repertory . The Louisville Orchestra commissioned Ouver-ture Mediterranee ( 1953 ) and Kentuckiana ( 1948 ) , but neither has been recurrent . Pianists sometimes program his Saudades do Brasil ( 1920-21 ) , duo-pianists his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foregoing have been or-chestrated ? and wood wind groups his Suite d'apres Corrette // ( 1937 ) and Le Cheminee du roi Rene ( 1939 ) . His Sacred Service ( 1947 ) is , with Bloch 's Avodath Hagodesh , a staple of the synagogue . Milhaud 's lyric Hebraic strain is perhaps most compelling in such early works as the exquisite First ( 1912 ) of his eight string quartets . Arthur Honegger became widely known to concert-goers through two works that achieved a vogue with symphony orchestras . The first of them , Pacific 231 , depicts the power-ful symmetry and dynamic energy of a great steam loco-motive plunging through the night . The other , Rugby , deals with the swift energy and disciplined teamwork of English football . Honegger was a fellow-pupil of Milhaud at the Paris Conservatoire , but although Honegger was a promi-nent member of Les Six , he was not altogether in sympathy with its aims , particularly in its pursuit of jazz . In 1920 he announced that he did not profess the cult of the music hall and the street fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cult of chamber and symphonic music in their most serious and austere aspects . Two of Honegger 's outstanding works are based on biblical subjects . One of them , Le Roi David ( 1921 ) , is a symphonic psalm for chorus and orchestra , and the other , Judith ( 1925 ) , is incidental music to a drama . A third religious work , the dramatic oratorio Jeanne d'Arc au Bucher ( 1938 ) , was briefly in vogue , but principally it has had the effect of focusing interest anew on the stunning and undeservedly neglected Le Roi David . Honegger 's symphonies have had the special advocacy of Charles Munch . The Second ( 1941 ) , for strings and trumpet , is a grim souvenir of Nazi-occupied Paris . The elegiac Fifth ( 1950 ) is perhaps the most powerful . It is inscribed , Di-tre-re , which does not mean " of three kings " ( remembering Monte-mezzi 's opera , L'Amore dei tre re ) but " of three D 's " ? " re " being the French for " D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each movement . // One of the most exquisite of Honegger 's works is his Pastorale d'ete , for small orchestra , also available as a piano duet . In certain passages , particularly in the closing measures , this work is definitely polytonal , and in others it uses poly-harmony by sounding simultaneously different chords in the single key of A major . The work is a splendid example of how delicately expressive , and how really beautiful , polytonality may become . The Hungarian Bela Bartok ( 1881 ? 1945 ) used polytonal harmonies nearly fifty years ago . In many ways he was as much a pioneer as Stravinsky or Schoenberg ; he experi-mented with involved and intricate rhythms , a:id at times he departed so far from fixed tonality as to seem almost atonal . His music invariably avoids any semblance of sentimentality and his dissonances are sharp and biting . It is not possible , however , to classify Bartok as a poly-tonalist or an atonalist , for he was not consistently either . He is more properly remembered as an intense nationalist , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folk music , in association with his fellow countryman , Zoltan Kodaly , has been of inestimable value in preserving excellent folk melodies . These have shown the world what Hungarian music really is . Bartok used this material in his own works , in highly modern fashion . In the decade after his death the music of Bartok was heard with amazing frequency . At least three or four of his orchestral works would seem to have been received into the permanent repertory : Music for Strings , Percussion , and Celesta ( 1936 ) , the stunning Concerto for Orchestra ( 1943 ) , the Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion ( 1937 ) , and the quite accessible Divertimento for String Orchestra ( 1939 ) . Bartok was himself a pianist , and a number of his many solo works for this instrument bid fair for ensconcement in the recital literature , although the three piano concertos are not frequently heard . The six string quartets ( 1908 ? 39 ) // have proved particularly enduring , as have the Sonata for Violin Unaccompanied ( 1944 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult works . Like so many other masters , Bartok never had the fame in life that came to him in death . His twilight years were not , however , without their belated rewards . Twice in November of 1944 he stood on the stage of Carnegie Ilall and acknowledged wave upon wave of applause ? once for the Unaccompanied Violin Sonata and again for the Concerto for Orchestra . A week later he could read of the latter 's tumultuous reception in Boston . As early as 1941 , Columbia University had retained BartOk as a Research Fellow , and moneys were found ( from private sources ) to renew this appointment later . In 1943 , after he had been stricken during a series of lectures at Harvard , the American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers took upon itself the assuming of all the composer 's outstanding and subsequent medical bills ? this for a man who was not even a member of the organization . The American composer , Charles Ives ( 1874-1954 ) , made liberal use of polytonality , and in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed voices , he afforded a simple and clear example of writing in two keys at once . The treble voices ( sopranos and altos ) sing in C major , and the men 's voices ( tenors and basses ) in G minor . In the score , each group has its own key signature : // Ives was a truly rugged pioneer , and became a unique figure among American composers . For years he was known to only a few musicians , and was regarded seriously by still fewer of them . In 1939 his Second Sonata for Piano , Concord , Mass. , 1840 ? 60 , which had been printed privately twenty years earlier , was played for the first time in New York 's Town Hall by John Kirkpatrick . Lawrence Gilman , writing in the Herald Tribune , proclaimed it " great music . . . indeed , the greatest music composed by an American , and the most deeply and essentially American in impulse and implication . " Those were strong words , and while there were many who could not agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him belated recognition at the age of sixty-four . The remarkable feature of Ives 's career is that he was experimenting when other modernists were still writing in more or less conventional styles . He arrived at his own conclusions absolutely uninfluenced ? note that his Over the Pavements was cast in the omnibus tonality of C ? F sharp fully five years before Petrouchka ! Born in Danbury , Connecticut , he was the son of George E. Ives , who had been a bandmaster in Grant 's army . The father was an adventurous spirit musically ; he studied acoustics and experimented with quarter tones . Charles Ives , the son , spent four years at Yale , where the conventional music training he received from Horatio Parker did not smother his pioneering spirit . Instead of devoting all his time to music , he entered the insurance business in 1898 , and later formed his own firm , in which he was active until 1930 . Composing was kept as his pleasure and his hobby , and because he did not have to depend on it for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without thought of money or fame . It may have been the musical impressions of his youth that shaped Ives 's 0 // extraordinary music : the effect of two bands at opposite ends of the village green , each playing a different piece ; reed organs out of tune ; the music of country fiddlers ; soldiers and bands marching , some out of step and trying to get in pace with their fellows . In addition to publishing the Concord Sonata at his own expense in 1919 , Ives issued in 1922 a volume of one hundred and fourteen songs , some of them simple and conventional , and some in the most advanced idiom imaginable . Recently a number of these songs have been reprinted in commerical editions . The composer wrote for all media : orchestral works , chamber music , choral works , piano music , and songs . Far and away his most popular orchestral work is the Third Symphony ( 1904 ) , which won a Pulitzer Prize after its premiere ? in 1946 , fully forty years after it was written . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought needed familiarity to certain of the composer 's shorter works . Balanchine has thrice changed the musical requirements to conform with changes in the ballet ; in its latest and probably its final form the score assembles Central Park in the Dark , Barn Dance ( from Washington 's Birthday ) , The Unanswered Question , Over the Pavements , In the Inn , and In the Night . AN EDITORIAL WRITER FOR Musical America ONCE REMARKED : " We are now , it seems , in the neo ' period of musical com-position . The first thing for the aspiring composer to do today is to decide which neo ' lodge he is going to join , and thereupon his cloth is cut for him and he wears the robes of his fellows . . . . If he wishes , the composer can be a neo-romantic , ' or a neo-impressionist , ' or a neo-classicist ' or , I suppose , even a neo-neoist , ' if he is a right smart fellow . " ' According to the dictionary , the prefix " neo " indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recent , late , especially a new and different form of a style or school , " but the late Olin Downes , writing in The New York Times , wondered if " pseudo " would not be more accurate . He asked whether " the exponents of neo-classicism ' do n't really mean pseudo-classicism , ' or just plain fake classicism , or the superficial imitation , in most unfortunate style , of the shell instead of the substance of the works of past masters . " If all the so-called neoclassic composers were mere imi-tators , Mr. Downes 's indictment would be just , but a vast body of the important music from the twentieth century falls in the neoclassic category , and many of the leading com-posers of today belong in its camp . As a movement , neo-classicism is one of the significant manifestations of modern music . The term means a new classicism , and it actually repre sents a turning back to the eighteenth century . Funda mentally , it is the twentieth century turning its back on the nineteenth century ; the practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1800 's . The impulse of neo-classicism is the same as that which produced atonality , a reaction against romanticism and impressionism . Unlike atonality , neoclassicism is not a tonal system . It ' makes use of any and all the systems its composers choose . A neoclassic composition may be polytonal or atonal , it may make use of the dissonances of Debussy or Ravel , or it may be somewhat conventional . Neoclassicism is a matter of form and spirit , rather than one requiring fixed patterns of tonal combinations . Hence , we do not speak of neoclassic chords or harmonies as we speak of atonal or polytonal passages We have already learned how the nineteenth-century ro manticists , in reacting from the formalism of the classic composers , became concerned more with the emotional con-tent of their music than with its outer form . The neoclassic composers have reversed the process ; now that romanticism has had its day , they , in turn , seem more concerned with perfection of form than with the content or poetic signifi cance of their music . Thus we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing Concerti Grossi , all in eighteenth-century forms . The difference be tween the twentieth- and eighteenth-century works is that modern composers , although they are writing in old forms , are allowing themselves the dissonant technique of the present day , and the privilege of disregarding the traditional rules of strict harmony and counterpoint . ' Marion Bauer , in her article on " Neo-Classicism " in the International Cyclopedia of Music and Musicians , described the neoclassic composers as " more impersonal , intellectual // and abstract than personal , emotional , and programatic . The Twentieth Century , " she wrote , " in its fear of being regarded as over-sentimental and romantic , sought complete emancipation from the graphic , the literary , the philosophical , and the emotional in music . " 2 We find , then , that the neoclassic composers aim at simplification of their music . Like the atonalists , they eliminate what they consider nonessential , and they condense their material as much as possible . Many neoclassic works are composed for small ensembles , and reacting from the enormous , complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are often scored for chamber orchestra . It is not altogether accurate to say that neoclassicism is an immediate reaction against romanticism , that the cycle has been a simple three-part pattern of classicism , romanticism , neoclassicism . Several intermediary steps intervened between romanticism and neoclassicism , and the most important of them is sometimes called primitivism , or what might be termed a downright barbarism in music . This represented a reversion almost to the cave man , and involved primitive rites and a tonal fury that blasted the ears of concert-goers . Primitivism undoubtedly had its background in the political , social , and economic upheavals of the first two decades of the century , the years when unrest was first appearing , and when the first World War was disrupting Europe 's complacency . The passing from primitivism to neoclassicism is best understood through the career of Igor Stravinsky , the Russian-born composer who has been a leader in the back-tothe-classics movement . Some critics accuse Stravinsky of an inconsistent adoption of so many different styles that he has become a musical hybrid ; but whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a definite series of 2 Oscar Thompson ( editor ) . Copyright ? 1939 by Dodd , Mead &; Company , Inc . I // developments that are characteristic of the course modern music has taken in the last quarter-century . Stravinsky was born in Oranienbaum , Russia , June 17 , 1882 . His father was a bass singer at the Imperial Opera , and although Igor was not a child prodigy , he was reared in a musical atmosphere , and as a youth tried his hand at composing . When he was nineteen , he met Rimsky-Korsakov , who suggested that he study with one of his own pupils . Then , when Stravinsky was sufficiently prepared , Rimsky-Korsakov accepted him as a private pupil , in 1907 . Stravinsky 's early works were thoroughly academic and conventional . His First Symphony , composed in 1905-07 , is Brahmsian in style , and shows no contemporary influences . A suite of songs for mezzo-soprano and orchestra , however , contains elements of impressionism . These were composed in 1908 when Stravinsky had commenced his studies with Rimsky-Korsakov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fireworks , to celebrate the marriage of Rimsky-Korsakov 's daughter . Four days after the ceremony , Rimsky-Korsakov died , and Stravinsky composed a memorial , Chant funebre . Stravinsky was inactive for a short period after Rimsky 's death , but a new stimulus appeared in the person of Sergei Diaghilev , who was organizing his Ballet Russe in Paris . It was Diaghilev , and the Russian ballet , who were directly responsible for Stravinsky 's most important works . Early in 1909 Stravinsky 's Fantastic Scherzo was performed in St. Petersburg , and Diaghilev was impressed with the way in which Stravinsky wrote for orchestra . He commissioned Stra-vinsky to orchestrate two Chopin pieces , a Nocturne and a Valse , for use in the ballet , Les Sulphides . Stravinsky laid aside an opera he had started , Le Rossignol , and made the orchestration for Diaghilev . Then he returned to his work on the opera . // He had no more than finished the first act when Diaghilev called on him once more , this time with a commission for an original work : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire Bird . Stravinsky went to work immediately and completed the score in May of 1910 , for production in Paris the following month . With the Fire Bird music a new Stravinsky appeared , a true disciple of Rimsky-Korsakov and an exponent of the Russian national school . The orchestra he used was the orchestra of Seheherazade , and the oriental elements of Rimsky 's style were amplified and brought up to date in brilliant fashion . It was not Rimsky-Korsakov , nor his shade , however , who composed the Fire Bird ; in spite of the influences it showed , the music belonged distinctively to Stravinsky , and the Fire Bird was an acknowledged masterpiece . Diaghilev showed his pleasure by commissioning another ballet the following year . This was Petrouchka , which was first produced at Paris in June , 1911 . This music originated with an instrumental Konzertstiick that Stravinsky had sketched for piano and orchestra . As the score developed , the piano and the orchestra were given a dialogue , each answering and imitating the other , which brought to the composer 's imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterpart of Petrouchka , who was the hero of an ancient Russian marionette show , a Muscovite Punch and Judy . As a ballet , Petrouchka was immediately successful , but its musical significance was far greater than people realized at first . The music marked a transition in Stravinsky 's style , from the fantasy of the Fire Bird to realism . The Fire Bird had a generous share of sustained , flowing melody , even though it was far more advanced harmonically than the works of Stravinsky 's teacher , Rimsky-Korsakov . Petrouchka is epi- // sodic , loosely constructed , and highly dissonant . If the Fire Bird represents the bridge between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , Petrouchka is pure twentieth. ; at least , early twentieth century . Most important of all , however , was his introduction of polytonality ? " his " for all practical purposes , at least ; Ives 's Over the Pavements was destined for decades of obscurity . It may have been an accident ; Stravinsky may have been amused by playing on the white keys with his right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any rate the vogue of polytonality dates from the appearance of the Petrouchka chord ( see pages 93-94 ) . The realism of Petrouchka led to the primitivism of the next ballet Stravinsky composed for Diaghilev , Le Sacre du printemps , the famous Rite of Spring . When this work was produced in Paris , May 29 , 1913 , it aroused such fury that the audience rioted . The music was so dissonant , so be wildering , that the world was faced " with the alternative either to reject this music as a freakish exhibition of an un balanced young man , or accept it as a revolutionary in novation. " 3 It is important to consider Le Sacre carefully for the mo ment , for it represents a point in Stravinsky 's career soon to be followed by a turn in the opposite direction , from the height of complexity to the utmost simplicity . Le Sacre is scored for an orchestra of tremendous size , and it employs crashing chords that were almost unbelievable to the ears of pre-War concert-goers . Anyone who knew Stravinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire Bird and Petrouchka , was aware that Le Sacre could not be a hap-hazard product , but that its composer was fully conscious // of what he was doing , and was accomplishing his purpose with a masterful , though grim and almost diabolical , grasp of his medium and his materials . Le Sacre du printemps deals with the sacrificial customs of primitive peoples , barbaric , brutal pagan rites , and it is not to be expected that such a composer as Stravinsky would have depicted primitive man with the cloying sweetness of conventional harmonies . Stravinsky claims that he would have written this sort of music even if he had not been writing it for the ballet . IIe says that he conceived it first as absolute music , entirely apart from any plot , and that its rough , uncouth themes themselves suggested to his mind the earth worship of primitive man . Thus , the idea for the ballet came from the music ; not the music from the plot of the ballet . This statement is important in showing that Stravinsky 's primitivism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come the fantasy of the Fire Bird , the opulence of the Russian-Oriental school ; then , the hard realism of Petrouchka ; and , third , the barbaric primitivism of Le Sacre . The world might well wonder what the next step would be , but it was not for another ten years that it found out , and by that time a colossal war had shaken the world . Just before the war , Stravinsky passed through a period during which he was absorbed in Russian folklore ; and , again using the utmost in performing resources , he composed Les Noces , a grandiose work for solo voices , chorus , four pianos , and seventeen percussion instruments . The composition of the " choreographic Russian scenes " which comprised Les Noces took altogether seven years , for the war interrupted its composition . Les Noces has something of the primitive quality of Le Sacre , but its primal urge is apparent through the roistering of peasants , rather than through the barbaric earth-worship of prehistoric man . // While Les Noces was as yet unfinished , Stravinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Russian tale about a deserting soldier and the devil . This Histoire du soldat , unlike Le Sacre or Les Noces , is most economical in its use of theatrical and musical resources . It is theater music that requires only a few actors , and a small ensemble of seven instruments . Following the idea of writing for limited combinations , Stravinsky continued to write for small groups , even when he became interested in American jazz , and composed his Ragtime for eleven instruments . He wrote a little suite of pieces for clarinet , without accompaniment , and in 1919 made a re-orchestration of the Fire Bird music , more restrained and less colorful than the original , and scored for a smaller orchestra . All these intermediary ventures were a preliminary to the actual turning point , which came when Stravinsky composed his Pulcinella ballet , produced in Paris , May 15 , 1920 . This work was based entirely on the music of the early eighteenthcentury composer , Pergolesi , and although Stravinsky was by no means a mere arranger in adapting this music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kept his own score chastely simple . There was no attempt at modernization . Pulcinella marked the beginning of Stravinsky 's neoclassic period . By adhering to the classicism of Pergolesi 's eighteenth-century style , Stravinsky had so imbued himself with its spirit that he was ready to adapt it to original compositions of his own invention . Thus he has completed in his own creative career a cycle that passed from late romanticism , through realism and primitivism , to a pure objectivism marked by a detached viewpoint and a formalism that reverts to Bach and Mandel . Stravinsky finished the movement that the Russian nationalists began fifty years before him , in the eighteen seventies . They wanted to rid music of the strangle110 MODERN MUSIC hold of German romanticism , and Stravinsky finished the job completely and effectively . In 1923 Stravinsky offered his first original work in the pure neoclassic manner , his Octet for Wind Instruments . In writing it he imposed upon himself the limitations that surrounded the early masters . He kept to the forms and the patterns of the classicists , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , polytonality and dissonance , he modified the radical elements that had marked his earlier works . Other Stravinsky works in the neoclassic manner are the Symphony of Psalms ( 1930 ) for chorus , an opera-oratorio , Oedipus Rex ( 1927 ) , and the ballet , Apollon Musagetes ( 1927 ) . Another ballet , Le Baiser de la fee ( 1928 ) , is based on Tchaikovsky themes , and Card Party ( 1936 ) , a ballet in " three deals , " describes a game of poker . Since taking up his residence in America , Stravinsky has completed notably his Symphony in C ( 1940 ) , Symphony in Three Movements ( 1945 ) , and an opera , The Rake 's Progress ( 1951 ) . Like atonality , neoclassicism places a premium on condensation , but only as a step toward simplification . Stravinsky once explained the need for brevity by pointing out the essential differences between eighteenth- and twentiethcentury classicism . " For a Mozart , " he wrote , " the invention of the theme , or of themes , represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made up in great part of a certain formalism , or at least technical skill had the upper hand over creative fantasy . . . . With the developments of the theme , the repetitions , refrains , and necessary cadenze , ' the halfhour was soon reached . " But now that in a scholastic sense this development of the theme no longer exists , and still less repetitions , . . . proportions have changed , and a concerto of fifteen minutes // is already a monumental work . Naturally it would be easy to lengthen the duration , but what would be added would be nothing but padding , inert matter , sound , but not music . " 4 In reverting to the patterns of the eighteenth century , as well as to its ideals and spirit , the neoclassicists naturally turn to the contrapuntal style of Bach and Handel ; to hori zontal weaving of parts and voices , and the forms of the canon and fugue . Where , however , the eighteenth-century masters limited themselves largely to consonant counterpoint , the modern classicists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shape the themes of their canons and fugues so that each part , or voice , will " make harmony " with the others . Thus the characteristic counterpoint of the twenti eth century is dissonant counterpoint ; the structures of fugues are identical with those of a couple of centuries ago , but their acrid dissonances and biting combinations of tones belong to our time . The Classical Symphony of Serge Prokofiev is an outstand ing product of the neoclassic movement , and is significant in being the work of a composer who started his career as a musical radical . Prokofiev was a Russian , born nine years later than Stravinsky ( 1891-1953 ) . Like Stravinsky , Prokofiev studied for a time with Rirnsky-Korsakov . His early works were highly original , and were marked by aggressive rhythms and bold harmonies . They had a driving , dynamic power that was all the more pronounced when tinged with Prokofiev 's love for the grotesque . They used almost every modern device except atonality , which appears in only one Prokofiev work , the cantata , Seven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1917 , antedating Stra vinsky 's neoclassic Octet by six years , and the Pulcinella // suite by one year . Prokofiev , then , was a neoclassicist before Stravinsky , but in his later works he did not follow the movement as closely as Stravinsky has . The Classical Symphony is concise , and written in four short movements according to the eighteenth-century pattern , substituting a gavotte for the customary minuet as the dance movement . Prokofiev explained that his idea in writing the symphony was " to catch the spirit of Mozart , and to put down that which , if he were living now , Mozart might put into his scores . " Bence , the music is marked by melodies which Mozart might conceivably have written , but colored with hannonic modernisms and sophistications that would have been puzzling to Mozart in his own time but might have pleased him , however , if he had been living in 1917 . After the war the ways of Stravinsky and Prokofiev became widely separated , principally because Stravinsky had no sympathy with the Russian Revolution and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his talents to the Communist cause . In 1937 he wrote a grandiose cantata , for the twentieth anniversary of the October Revolution , to a text made from the speeches of Lenin , Stalin , and Marx . Following the production of his opera , The Love for Three Oranges ( in Chicago , 1921 ) , Prokofiev followed Stravinsky 's example by writing ballets for Diaghilev . The first , Buffoon , was produced in Paris in 1921 . Then came Le Pas d'acier ( The Age of Steel ) in 1927 , and L'En f ant prodigue in 1929 . Prokofiev spent the last twelve years of his life working on an opera based on Tolstoi 's War and Peace . It was produced first at Leningrad in 1946 , and then in a revised and shortened version in the same city seven years later . America heard it in 1957 when it was produced on television by the NBC-TV Opera Company . Critical opinion differed as to whether Prokofiev had produced an integrated music-drama or a // series of episodes from Tolstoi 's novel , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving that they rank with the finest moments in modern opera . Prokofiev composed also a number of purely instrumental works : five piano concertos , two violin concertos , two ' cello concertos , and seven symphonies , of which the Classical Symphony was the first . Whatever it may indicate , the Soviet period of Prokofiev 's works brought a lyric quality to his music that has overshadowed the grotesque touches so prominent in his early compositions . He kept , however , the childlike sense of humor so delightfully apparent in the musical fairy tale for children , Peter and the Wolf . In this score each character is represented by an instrument in the orchestra : the Wolf by the French horns , Peter 's grandfather by the bassoon , etc . Dmitri Shostakovich , born in Russia in 1906 , ranks with Stravinsky and Prokofiev as one of the three most important composers Russia has produced in modern times . Aside from his undoubted talent , Shostakovich is interesting as an example of a creative artist adapting himself to political and social changes , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Symphony when he was nineteen , and through its performance a year later he attracted immediate attention . Here was a work that had ingenious melodies and novel rhythms ; it was modern enough to be interesting , and academic enough to be agreeable and under . stood . In a way it was neoclassic , for it was direct and to the point , with a structural design that was easily followed . A year later Shostakovich presented his Second Symphony , written for the tenth anniversary of the Soviet Republic . This did not meet with the success of the First Symphony . Next , the composer wrote an opera , The Nose , which satirized an important government official . In its score Shostakovich became complex , and used atonal patterns . The // opera was produced at Leningrad in 1930 , and was assailed by the Russian Association of Proletarian Composers as a product of " bourgeois decadence . " The Third Symphony , like the Second , had political significance . Modeled after the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven , it ended with a choral movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symphony was followed by two more ballets , both of them satirical , with indictments of non-Soviet peoples . Then came a most significant work , a second opera , Lady Macbeth of the District of Mzensk . In spite of a highly suggestive interlude , which was eliminated from Russian productions of the opera , Lady Macbeth enjoyed a vogue in Russia and in other countries . Official indictment , however , in the form of an article in Pravda , condemned the work as theatrically vulgar and " musically formalistic . " This article was followed by another , in the same periodical , which attacked a Shostakovich ballet , The Limpid Stream , as a frivolous and oversimplified essay on the subject of collective farming . It looked as though official disfavor would bring an end to Shostakovich 's brilliant career . To prevent this , the young composer accomplished a complete change of creative style , and was genius enough to do it successfully . He withdrew a fourth symphony , and started writing a fifth , which was performed late in 1937 , and achieved tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian people , and the musical spokesman for the Soviet government . During the summer of 1942 ( July 19 ) , the NBC Symphony Orchestra , under Toscanini , gave the first American performance to Shostakovich 's Seventh Symphony . This was one of the first major works to be inspired by the Second World War , and it was composed , for the most part , near one of the fighting fronts . The composer began it in June , 1941 , and wrote much of the score in Leningrad while he was engaged // in watching for fires and in other defense activities of the besieged city . The symphony is dedicated " to our struggle against Fascism , to our future victory , to my native city , Leningrad . " It is a lengthy work ; the American premiere ran about an hour and a quarter , and critical opinion agreed upon the sincerity of the symphony and the imposing effect of the climaxes , but observed that it was marred by unevenness of outline , resulting perhaps from the circumstances of its com position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the epmposer to sift and weigh the value of his material , and subject it to his own stiff criticism . Some other rationalization must be contrived for the meretricious Eighth Symphony of 1945 ; likewise the Ninth of a year later . The Tenth , however , needs none . It is a work of high art at high compression , and devoid of any kow-towing to bureaucracy . The neoclassic movement has touched composers of widely separated styles and ideals . In Spain , we find Manuel de Falla composing a Harpsichord Concerto ( 1923-26 ) , for harpsichord ( or piano ) and flute , oboe , clarinet , violin , and ' cello . De Falla is steeped in the Spanish tradition , and through his own individuality has brought a fusion of his nation 's past and present . In Italy , Alfredo Casella was at one time violently assailed for his modernism , and his Elegia Eroica , dedicated to the war dead , provoked a riot when it was performed at Rome in 1917 . Casella worked out a polytonal style that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently his Concerto for String Quartet , composed in 1923-24 , re verted to an Italian classicism , even though it employed an extended tonal system . In 1926 he followed the example of Stravinsky 's Puldnella by writing a work for piano and // orchestra called Scarlattiana , based on themes of Scarlatti . The Swiss-American Ernest Bloch ( 1880 ) has composed two Concerti Grossi for strings and piano obbligato , both full of new ideas in old patterns . Falla , Casella , and Bloch have already been mentioned for their impressionism ( Chapter 5 ) . The two Americans most closely identified with neoclas sicism are the lately more neoromantic Walter Piston ( 1894 ? ) and the more and more granitic Roger Sessions ( 1896 ) . In spite of his advanced harmonic combinations , Piston is always direct and to the point ; he respects con vention in the formal design of his structure , and he is exceedingly fond of imitative counterpoint , and the canon and fugue of the eighteenth century . His music for the ballet , The Incredible Flutist , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ambitious productions . The Fourth Symphony ( 1952 ) was perhaps his most personal statement and certainly his boldest ; three of its four move ments sweep to climaxes of stunning resonance . Piston is a native of Maine and is head of the music de partment at Harvard University . Sessions has acknowledged Stravinsky 's influence , but he insists that he does not belong to any " school " or limited group of stylists . In 1927 he announced : " I reject any kind of dogma or platform . I am not trying to write modern , ' American , ' or neo-classic ' music . I am seeking always and only the coherent and living expression of my musical ideas . " In spite of this disclaimer , there is in Sessions ' mature work an orthodox feeling for form ; his String Quartet most cer tainly labels him as a composer with the ideals of a clas sicist . Ile is by nature a perfectionist , which is perhaps re sponsible for his relatively small number of works . In the // 1927 statement he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but at the same time believe that perfection in art consists in a sort of equilibrium which can be neither defined nor counterfeited . " In his Three Chorales for Organ and in his Piano Sonata , Sessions shows his love for perfection in design and structure , and sometimes the manner in which he expresses his ideas is more significant than the ideas themselves . He has also several symphonies , a Violin Concerto , three dirges for orchestra , and numerous other works that have enjoyed critically ( if not popularly ) successful performances . Like Piston , he is a teacher of composition . For many years he has been associated with Princeton tniversity . It was there , in 1955 , that New York critics ventured to hear his one-act opera , The Trial of Lucullus . The consensus was not favorable , at least as far as the work 's stage-worthiness was concerned . His Idyll of Theocritus , for dramatic soprano and orchestra , was more cordially received the following year . The Second Quartet of 1952 probably was his most outstanding work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Maskers , remained Sessions ' only representation in the standard repertory . Roy Harris , born in Oklahoma in 1898 , is one of the most picturesque figures among our creative musicians . Like Sessions and a few other iconoclasts , he is not easy to classify . He is polytonal whenever he finds that combined tonalities answer his purpose ; he is rarely , if ever , atonal ; his intense Americanism , with its racy flavor of the Southwest , gives his work a highly nationalistic character . He is , however , very much the neoclassicist in his attempt to adapt old forms to present-day needs . Harris makes no compromise whatever with the conservative elements in his audiences . He never tries to write music that will be easy for traditionally conditioned ears to listen to ; much of his work is difficult and // disconcerting at first hearing . His dissonances are uncompromising and caustic , and his structure is involved and complex in spite of his neoclassic leanings . Behind all of Harris ' works there is an idealism and a philosophy that motivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he advanced for his First Symphony is characteristic . In its three movements , he said , he tried " to capture the mood of adventure and physical exuberance " ; then to show " the pathos which seems to underlie all human existence " ; and finally , to catch " the mood of a positive will to power and action . " The long list of Harris ' works includes eight symphonies ( the Third of 1938 remains his finest achievement ) , an Orchestral Suite , a Piano Sonata , sVeral string quartets , a Sextet , and a Symphony for Voices . Yet , while Harris can attain such enviable heights in some of his works , his facility for mass production has led him into many pitfalls . He may with justice pride himself on the fact that his vogue has not been achieved by concessions to the public ; he has punished its ears cruelly on occasion and it comes back for more , but a careful review of the repeat performances shows that his actual hold on the public rests on relatively few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aesthetics , are due consideration . Paul Creston ( New York City , 1906 ) has written five symphonies , all of them melodious , surcharged with intensity , and given to personal rhetoric at the expense of form . This has not militated against their substantial and growing acceptance among the broader public . Samuel Barber ( West Chester , Pa. , 1910 ) used to be widely heard but the level of his mature effort has not fulfilled the promise of his early Adagio for Strings , the two Essays for Orchestra , and the magnificent Symphony in One Movernent of 1936 . William Schuman ( New York City , 1910 ) has given // us , in his Third Symphony of 1941 and Sixth Symphony of 1948 , two of the most impressive utterances of the twentieth century . His fusion of the several chromatic styles ( i. e. , out of Schoenberg ) is effected by a linear classicism no less strong than the personality that is its motor force .                @ @ @ @ @
