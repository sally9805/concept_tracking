Nor so long ago I was meeting my young friend Margaret for lunch . " Do you mind stopping at the bank first ? " she asked . " I have to send some money to my boss . He 's in Washington , and he telephoned this morning that he 's short of cash . It wo n't take a minute . " It would n't have taken a minute , either , if when we got to the bank we 'd happened on the bright and capable Miss Dixon first . But she was n't sitting at one of those desks out in the open . That is where the men sit . A very handsome young one was at the desk we stopped at . He rose courteously as we approached and listened with mounting bewilderment while Margaret , with admirable clarity , stated the nature of her errand . He did n't get it the first time and , after her second try , shook his head sadly . " Oh , we could n't very well do that , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for years , " Margaret explained , - and besides , here is a check made out to him for the exact amount . " The handsome young man looked around helplessly , then his eye brightened as a girl came briskly by . " Oh . Miss Dixon , " he called , " have you got a moment ? Will you take care of these ladies ? " Miss Dixon understood the problem immediately . " Of course , " she said , " it 's very simple , " and led us to a window where there was another man , elderly this time , and not very glad to see us . Miss Dixon explained the situation carefully and then , step by step , told him what to do . Even so he had to be prompted by Margaret several times after Miss Dixon had left us . Margaret is a quick study . We laughed about it a bit at lunch and said that what that bank needed was more Miss Dixons , or to make Miss Dixon president . We agreed that the latter seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while women hold 60 per cent of all bank jobs , they hold only 10 per cent of bank executive jobs ) . Just why Miss Dixon will in all probability never be president of this bank it is hard to say . Very likely the officers of this large New York bank have never seriously considered the possibility of a woman president . ( There are some women bank presidents , but most of them are in small towns . Mrs. Georgia Clark , for instance , the Treasurer of the United States , was formerly the president of a bank in Richland , Kansas , population 200 . ) It may well be that the directors , the borrowers , the depositors would not care to see a woman in charge in this traditionally masculine field . But it may also be that Miss Dixon herself would shy violently away from such an idea . She 'd much rather be right where she is than president . I well remember a conversation I had with a friend with whom I had been working in a wartime government agency which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real responsibility and had executed her manifold duties with apparent ease and vigorous good sense . We were talking about what we would be doing next . " You know , " she said , " it sounds absurd , and I 'm ashamed to admit it , but the kind of job I really want is to be that invaluable- , assistant to a man who is doing something I believe in . I 'd work like a nailer , and I 'd be so tactful that he would n't know how much he depended on me , but I want him to make the final decisions . " She paused a minute and then said reflectively , " I think it 's the kind of job most women really want . " I may confess that her words gave me a real shock , but I believe that she uttered a profound truth . I believe that a great many women have an essentially low opinion of their own powers , that they are possessed by a feeling of humility that is at the same time touching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century just ended that has been appearing in periodicals and broadcast over the air , hardly a commentator has failed to mention the emancipation of women as one of the most striking phenomena of the period . And , indeed , the political , economic , and social changes in the status of women during the past fifty years represent ? in theory , at least ? an accumulation of freedoms and opportunities that should add up to a brave new world hardly dreamed of by the early feminists . I hardly need to enumerate them : all the way from the right to vote and to hold public office , the right to enter practically any field of work , and the broader opportunity for higher education , down to the right to drink and smoke in public , restrictions and taboos have disappeared right and left . The astonishing thing is that , with all these gains , the great majority of women regard themselves so slightly and put so low an estimate on their individual worth as members of society as a whole . T HERE seems little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has done much volunteer work with women declares that for each one who will head up a committee or take charge of a drive , there aredozens who shrink from a position of responsibility . " Let me lick the stamps , " they beg . Devoted and hard-working , they are so humble that they do not honestly think they are capable of making decisions or directing other people . For the sake of argument , I 'll admit that perhaps many of this type may be found among the older women who grew up before the era of their liberation , and who still think along the old lines : that woman 's work is the execution of small details , necessary but unremarkable , while someone else ? a man ? directs the enterprise . These are the women who have always worked in the Ladies ' Aid or the Women 's Auxiliary and never dreamed of being on the Vestry ( although everybody in town knows that without their support the church would fade away ) . Veil , what about the younger women ? What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are they for the most part confident , self-assured ? Do they give the impression that the world is their oyster ? During the past few years I 've had the opportunity of talking to the heads of vocational bureaus in several women 's colleges , and it has been my good fortune , too , to discuss jobs with a fair number of the girls themselves . These girls have struck me as highly intelligent , mature , and capable ? so much more knowledgeable and generally attractive than my own college generation was at the same age that I am awed by them . But I am also struck by how often these most excellent young women lack the confident ambition that their equipment would seem to warrant . Modesty is a pleasing quality , but their approach is often more humble than modest , and their reasons for wanting a job are strangely nebulous . " All my friends are working , " or " I 'd like to live in New York , " or " I have to do something " recur over and over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category . The surprising thing is that so many are . Nobody expects the recent graduate to have a long-range program planned in detail . Lots of people do n't know exactly what they want to do . They have to feel their way around and see how they can fit into our complex industrial pattern . I do think , however , that the girl who announces that she would like a research job , and apparently has n't thought of anything beyond that , is setting her sights pretty low . The safe and anonymous spot where you work hard and someone else signs his name and takes the final praise or blame may be all very well , but the positive note , not to mention the pioneer note , is certainly lacking . I have noticed , too , when girls discuss a change of jobs , how seldom they seem to have explored the possibility of making something more of the old job before giving it up . Instead of looking around to see what needs to be done in the office where they are working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about lack of opportunity and advancement ? forgetting that advancement usually comes to those who can see beyond their noses . As far as these girls are concerned , one must not forget that their generation has taken quite a beating . Children of the Great Depression , they faced up to World War II at a highly impressionable age . It is little wonder that their generation ? girls and men alike ? views the chances of another depression or another war with a special dismay , and wants to hold on to and cherish whatever it can of the normal , the stable , the safe , rather than to reach out for the uncertain . The concept of security has been dinned into us as the chief desideratum for some years now , and it 's not surprising that young people have been persuaded by this most unsiren-like song . A Fortune survey of the class of ' 49 ( which numbers some 150,000 men ) from some 1,200 colleges reveals that in general " Forty-nine is taking no chances . . . what they do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economy , and their place in it , they seem , to a stranger from another generation , somehow curiously old before their time . Above everything else , security has become the great goal . " II T HE preoccupation with security is not , then , a quality of mind that is confined to women . Men want it too . But it 's the women I 'm talking about , and I can not believe that this is the whole explanation of their humility . Let 's return to those great gains made for and by women in the past fifty years . How much has been real and how much illusory ? One field where the results are comparatively easy to estimate is in " gainful occupations . " How much has the picture changed since the days when nursing and teaching were almost the only polite occupations in which women could engage ? Numerically speaking , the change is enormous . More than eighteen million women ? about 30 per cent of the nation 's labor force ? are in paid employment ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the active housekeeper 's daily routine is of no economic value ! ) . The figure has been rising for a long time , and there seems to be no reason to suppose that it will presently begin to slide downhill . Moreover , the fields open to women appear to include practically everything . Ten years ago the census report showed women employed in all but nine of the 451 job classifications . Even in the professions , there are very few graduate schools left that refuse admission to women students . The Harvard Medical School , for example , held out against their admission for many years , and capitulated after World War II . The war demonstrated women 's ability to learn highly technical skills with an ease that surprised everybody . And the idea of women working outside the home is now so socially acceptable that the daughters of even prosperous families look for a job as a matter of course , when they leave school or college ? unless they are getting married at once or taking graduate courses . So far so good ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no question as to the complete acceptance of the feminine secretary in the business world . How many times have you heard a man boast about his secretary ? A good many , I 'll warrant . " She 's the real brains of this outfit " or " She knows more about this business than I do " are familiar accolades . Nobody has any doubts about the place of the good secretary in the industrial scene . She 's indispensable , that 's all . In this essentially secondary , ministering role , she has won a secure place for herself . But when one examines the higher echelons , women are much less numerous than one might expect . There 's no biological reason why women ca n't be presidents , vice presidents , editors-in-chief . Too many of them are filling these positions for that old argument to hold water . Josephine Roche , Elizabeth Arden , Edna Wool-man Chase , Carmel Snow , Dorothy Shaver , to mention only a few conspicuously successful executives , have conclusively proved that women can get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing list of women in high executive jobs . The wonder is that such lists are still compiled , that a successful business woman should be news . And in the lower brackets , where most of the working women are found , they do not yet get equal pay with men for the same kind of work . In the professions and the arts ( with the exception of writing and acting ) women 's performance can not compare with men 's in terms of per capita distinction . It is impossible to say whether this is the fault of women themselves or of the way business and the professions are rigged . I suspect that both are responsible and that it makes for a vicious circle . p OLITICALLY the situation seems to be much the same . When women got the vote in 1920 , there were those who predicted that in a short time women would be holding office all over the place . Nothing of the sort happened . In a speech given early in 1948 to the Women 's Bureau Conference , Miss C. Mildred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are , of course , today notable women in high political offices , and it has been the custom in the last few years for the Administration to appoint one woman on each of several important public commissions . But notice , please , that it is generally one woman , not five or six among a dozen members . This continued failure to assume full positions of power remains a problem . It is a surprise and a source of disappointment to many women ? and to some men ? that in these thirty years almost since women attained the franchise , so few women hold public office high or low , and so few even have stood for election to office . " Again I rather imagine that the fact that women have not risen more noticeably to " full positions of power " in the political world is not wholly their fault . In the smoke-filled rooms as around the directors ' boards there are still a great many men who would not be entirely at ease if there were women present , and the problems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the situation is reversed . So when we reflect on these two great gains ? the freedom to choose one 's occupation and the right to vote and to hold public office ? we see that women have still a long way to go before they realize completely the dreams and aspirations of the early champions of women 's rights . The last thing I would advocate would be a return to the militant tactics of some of the early feminists . Their battles were fought and won with an aggressiveness that would today be as out-of-date as it would be unlovely . Let us not forget the doors they opened ; the woman of 1950 does n't have to push her way in , she does have to make herself welcome . Only by the exercise of her own individual talents and powers in full co-operation with others can she make the contribution to society that the times need . Part of Mrs. Roosevelt 's extraordinary influence is due to the very fact that she is a woman and talks a woman 's language . Senator Margaret Chase Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hampered by the fact that she is a very attractive person . ND ND what about the housewives ? Freedom from domestic drudgery is something that is talked about a good deal , particularly by the manufacturers of house-hold machinery , and there is no question but that labor-saving devices and processed foods have vastly simplified the techniques of cook-ing and cleaning and washing clothes . But there are two sides to this medal . Servants have largely disappeared from the homes of all but the wealthy , small children still need constant attention , and the business of house-keeping takes more time , no matter how many mechanical aids you have , than the advertise-ments suggest . Moreover , even if some time has been saved , the disappearance of fine needlework and other domestic crafts has cut off a number of outlets for creative energy that our grandmothers enjoyed and took pride in . ( We 're trying to re-open small crea-tive avenues with our talk about hobbies , but such occupations used to be part of daily home living . ) In short , in simplifying the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housekeeper of much of the dignity and prestige it once had . Women are not as proud of the title of good housekeeper as they were when housekeeping was an executive job , with servants to direct , household arts and crafts to supervise and execute , and when mother and father were nearly absolute authority . ( Those were the days before the phrase , " Mother knows best , " was the big joke it is today . She used to think she did know best , poor soul , before that was beaten out of her . ) It must be admitted , too , that women get very little to bolster their morale from reading about themselves . And there 's a lot to read ? usually under the general heading , " What 's the Matter with Women ? " ' You do n't find people writing on " What 's the Matter with Men ? " They write about the shortcomings of American husbands or business men or politicians or farmers , but they do n't take the entire sex as a target . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are lumped together as if all women were alike . They are scolded for being clinging and possessive mothers and demanding wives ; they are sighed over by the older feminists , men and women , for not making the most of their great opportunities ; they are criticized for leaving home , and they are urged to get out of their homes . At the same time , they are exhorted to protect and elevate public morals and manners , to work for the good of the community , to keep alive the sacred flame of the arts , and to be the pillars of the church . Moreover , as keepers of the family purse , they are cajoled and bullied by the advertiser with all the artful cunning he can muster ? which is considerable . It is small wonder if some , confronted by this formidable list of obligations , feel that they are failing . But in addition to these , perhaps the strongest reason for a humble attitude on the part of many women is quite simply the desire to be liked by men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who look up to them with passive admiration has been given a new lease on life by certain present-day psychiatrists who are saying firmly that society is sick because women are sick ; and that the reason women are sick is that they have been trying too hard to compete with men , that they have special emotional stresses and strains that are resolved only by strict devotion to the role of wife and mother . This attitude is reflected ? as Mirra Komarovsky pointed out in the November Harper 's in a movement in educational circles to change the college curriculum for girls on the grounds that it was mistakenly patterned after that of the men 's colleges and that girls should be taught quite different things ? things like preparation for marriage , bringing up children , household economics . ( As if they and they alone were responsible for family life ! ) This seems to me to be getting back to the battle of the sexes that I thought we 'd got over . I can not see that much is going to be gained by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a great deal lost . For in the great historic movement of the past century toward human liberty and equality , the changing status of women has been only one aspect of the general revolution . Women did not win what rights they now possess through their own efforts alone . Nor will they be able to adapt themselves fully to their changed status of today and tomorrow without the understanding aid of men ; and everything that separates men and women into different categories instead of strengthening their community of interests is a brake on civilized progress . III I s THERE anything to be done to help women disabuse themselves of their humility ? I think there are several things . The first is to understand the interweaving pressures and the changes that have come about , some rapidly , some slowly , and to bring our own social thinking up to date to conform with the real conditions of today 's living . We are burdened with a number of outworn ideas and concepts that are costly anachronisms.and cloud the scene . In spite of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . They are not humble-minded , and we do n't have to worry about them . It 's the others , who have n't adjusted so well , whom we 're considering . Each individual must , of course , in the long run , do her own adjusting , but it is n't quite fair to put the whole burden on her , for it 's everybody 's business . Before I move on to specific ideas that I think we should discard , let me point out a factor in women 's lives today that is comparatively new and much more important than many of us realize ? the lack of continuity . When families were larger , and the period of child-bearing consequently longer , the married woman passed from the duties of mother to the duties of grandmother with only a small break in time . And the duties and pleasures of grandmother were very real . Now , with a period of work outside the home before marriage , and usually up to the time children begin to come , you have a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of occupation , with demanding duties , until her children are fourteen or fifteen , and then , when she is in her forties , these duties are done , and she has to make another radical change and find some rewarding occupation if she does n't want to face a series of empty days and a general feeling of uselessness . Grandmothers are pretty well intimidated these days and are told to keep out of the way ? unless , of course , a crisis arises . Indeed , the problems of the older woman are serious enough to rate a whole new literature . In short , it 's more complicated to be a woman . More complicated than it used to be ? More complicated than to be a man ? Both . tin now as to the ideas I believe it 's time to abandon . First , I 'd like women to think of themselves first as people and then as women . I 'd like men to do the same , but that 's probably asking too much , right at the start . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatic laugh the word " wife " produces in some circles of male society . It 's like " Brooklyn , " and seems to have succeeded " mother-in-law . " Our intense preoccupation with youth is another concept that has got out of hand . Granted that youth is ? or can be ? highly attractive , and that Browning was certainly stretching things in that " best is yet to be " line , still the aspect of youth that is most often presented to us ? in mass media at any rate ? is physical charm or the eccentricities of the teen-agers , rather than the tireless vigor , the confident idealism , the fearless adventuring spirit that are the classic attributes of youth . The older man has been getting a break lately : Hardly a critic failed to remark gratefully on the novelty of the middle-aged planter 's winning the young Army nurse in " South Pacific , " and the intense and widespread interest in the recent marriages of Vice President Barkley and Mayor O'Dwyer would seem to show that glamour-beyondfifty for men is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a mature woman might have some charm of her own is still dismissed as absurd , if not downright unwholesome . If by any chance such a creature appears in popular fiction , she is up to no good , and is a cause of acute discomfort and misery to her family . This pressure to remain young , or to attempt to preserve an illusion of youth , shows up even among scientists ; in a recent issue of the Journal of Social Psychology , Ralph R. Norman comments on the fact that ten times as many women as men fail to list their age in the Directory of the American Psychological Association , and attributes this concealment to ( I ) the glorification of youth in our culture ; ( 2 ) the premium placed by society on marriage and motherhood ; ( 3 ) a potential competition with men for jobs , where the older woman is at a double disadvantage , on the score of age as well as sex . That marriage per se is the ultimate in happy security is another concept that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ending , " . . . and so they were married and lived happily ever after , " belonged to the literature of the nursery , or of the Victorian era , but a glance at any issue of any woman 's magazine shows that this is not so . Page after page is illustrated with close-ups of melting girls and ardent youths clasped in fond embraces , and although the final goal ? matrimony ? is not reached until you get to the back of the book , there it is , the solution to all problems . It seems hardly necessary to point out that marriage is not an end in itself , that like every other worth-while thing it has to be worked at , that the wedding is the starting point , not the finish line , that ydivorce is unhappily on the increase , or that single women have been known to have full , happy , even distinguished lives . One can only wonder at the persistence of the myth that marriage automatically ensures a safe and desirable existence . The mechanics of daily living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every woman has to decide for herself , but the married woman who wants to work outside the limits of the domestic routine has to consider the needs and desires of the family group . It must be remembered that the mother of young children who undertakes a full-time job outside the home must have an abundance of energy ; and also that the cost of competent care for the children in her absence comes high . It can be done , it has been done successfully , but it takes a lot of doing . The married woman who works is not flouting convention , but whereas it is accepted that the man is the breadwinner and no nonsense , the wife who through necessity or choice ( or both ) sets out to augment the family income will have a much easier time if her husband regards her efforts as having equal importance to his own , even if the financial return is less . And our thinking should somehow be adjusted to the fact that if the woman happens to make more money than her husband it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I CAN NOT emphasize strongly enough my point that I am not urging an active career in the outside world for all women . I am only hoping that women who do undertake such ventures will set their sights a little higher , will not shrink from responsibility , will occasionally take the daring chance , essay the high venture , and will realize that opportunities are not always plainly so labeled . Sometimes you have to make them yourself . That there are still dead ends for women in various fields , I admit , but these ends can be moved back if we push hard . Nor am I suggesting that the housewife rush out immediately and organize a drive for slum clearance or undertake an investigation of the state of affairs in the nearest mental hospital , or take up the lute and Sanskrit . I do believe that in many communities , however , there could be a healthier distribution of civic energy if more attention were paid to individuals as such and if it were not assumed that men hold the executive jobs and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in social gatherings , it would be refreshing to hear more women join in the talk about politics or foreign affairs without the shield of a quotation from Edward ' Morrow or " my son in Washington . " I 've tried to suggest some of the causes that contribute to the humility of women who have no business being humble : but they are offered as explanations , not as excuses . What this country ? in its new , if unsought , position of world leadership ? needs is a vigorous and fearless society in which men and women work and live together in mutual respect and good will . There 's too much to be done to allow those who have gifts and advantages the luxury of sinking into the back seat , however comfortable it may be .
