" Yet he seemed to love children ( " what a hum of little voices ! . . . How pleasant . . . How healthful ! " ) , and children seemed to love him . He never used the rod on them , knew how to liven their lessons with poems and games . <P> Walt Whitman 's career as a schoolmaster was short : after five years he turned to journalism , took jobs with the Brooklyn Star and Brooklyn Eagle . But he never lost his interest in U.S. schools , and in his editorial columns he became one of the most dedicated educational critics of his day .
