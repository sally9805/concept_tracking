Stalin 's Death <P> Sir : Many thanks for your section on " Death in the Kremlin " in the March 16 issue . It was truly a masterpiece of information . As usual , TIME gives its readers what they are asking for . <P> WILLIAM LINDLEY Chamberlain , S. Dak . <P> Sir : Stalin 's lust for more power , and the praises from the people he had fooled , are meaningless to him now . We read of his mother 's tender care for him , her teachings and desires that he should be good for humanity and himself . . . What is there left to say but to quote the Bible : " For what shall it profit a man , if he shall gain the whole world , and lose his own soul ? Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul ? " MRS . W. A. EDLUND Denver <P> On the Kerosene Range Sir : . . . Your March 2 article on Westinghouse 's Gwilym Price was interesting . Betty Furness and her sales work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to act " as though she never heard of that old-fashioned knickknack she had plugged just the week before . " is " a range which will preserve even week the newest bride from cooking disasters . " I am getting married out here in June ( bride also a missionary ) , but I 'm afraid this newest item would be of little value . . . some of Betty 's old , forgotten items would be of more use here . Does she happen to remember that there was ever such a thing as a kerosene range ? ( Of course , Westinghouse would never recall such ! ) . . . More power to Westinghouse and Betty , but right now I 'll look for the forgotten kerosene range and know that my bride will be very happy if I can get it . <P> GEORGE D. BEACHAM Zinder , French West Africa <P> How to Pedal Tricycles Sir : . . . Let me join the many who will notice this sentence : " Then he and curly-headed Barbara Anne peddled their tricycles over a stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , March 23 . " TIME forgot to say whether the Eisenhower tykes finally sold their trikes . And what will they be pushing next week ? WENDELL SMITH Santa Monica , Calif . <P> Sir : The Eisenhower grandchildren ( poor little things ! ) peddling tricycles . . . it does seem that they are just a wee bit young . Where are our Child Labor laws ? . . . <P> FAVA K. PARKER Ogden , Utah <P> Sir : Shame on TIME 'S proofreader . . . MILDRED B. MUNDAY Lewisburg , Pa . TIME 's copyreader pleads guilty to a bad brake . - ED . <P> Royal Manners Sir : Your March 16 picture of Queen Elizabeth II removing her own wrap was disgusting . . . You called it " a moment of royal informality " ; I call it plain old bad manners . Let 's hope the American male does n't take stock in this incident . They are already prone to be lax . . . As for the Duke of Edinburgh , I 'm sure he must know better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any member of our local high-school football squad would have helped the Queen with her wrap , and possibly would have given her a little pat on the back afterwards . We certainly would have slapped the Duke down in the meantime . E. C. McMULLEN Pine Bluff , Ark.
