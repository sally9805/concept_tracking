 | Chances are , if you were walking along New York 's East 67th Street , you would n't even notice the place . The narrow gray stone building is no different from the other buildings that line the street . There is no name on the yellow wooden door . The only display in the single window is a noncommittal piece of ornamental statuary . There is no doorman , no sign , no plaque ? only the single word " Valentina " in block letters on the side of the green marquee . Yet this building is general headquarters for one of the most fabulous fashion establishments in all the world . Here Valentina designs , produces , sells , and fits the dresses that have made her name a synonym for fashion perfection . Women who are rich enough to be dressed by Valentina ? her dresses begin at $495 , average $600 ? automatically are among fashion pace setters . If you were turned loose in the closets of many of the world 's best-dressed women , Valentina 's is a label you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the only label . These are the closets of Valentina regulars ? a list that reads like a Who 's Who in society , the theatre , government , and journalism . What 's it like to buy one of the fabulous Valentina dresses ? What happens to you when you push open that massive yellow doe ' ? What do you get for your money , and what do n't you get ? Who goes to her , and why , and what does it mean to those of us who love clothes but probably spend considerably less on our wardrobes in ten years than a regular Valentina customer spends in a single season ? If you come into Valentina 's " off the street " ? unknown , unsponsored , and without an appointment ? your chances of buying a dress , or in fact even seeing one , are not good . You will certainly not see Valentina ! You enter an elegantly bare , highceilinged room with gray walls , figured carpeting , and a minimum of furniture . A long mirror runs along one wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally planned the counter as a hat bar , but there are no hats in sight and no chairs along the counter . Nor do you see any dresses , nor any displays ? animate or inanimate ? unless you count the trim receptionist who sits behind a small table desk and guards the stairway to the upstairs salon in the politest , yet firmest , manner . You ask to see dresses . If you do n't give your name , the receptionist may or may not ask for it . She asks you to be seated and , telephoning upstairs , has an inaudible conference with Valentina 's assistant , Harriet Arnold . If your name means nothing to Miss Arnold , or if you withhold it , the receptionist tells you that she will be glad to make an appointment for you to see Madame Valentina at some future date but at the moment it is quite impossible . Courteously but firmly . If you persist , saying you would like to look at dresses even if Valentina  | herself ca n't show them . you will eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly two or three ? and then regretfully confess that the collection is unfortunately not yet assembled , that there is very little to be shown at this time . Again you are invited to make an appointment . Then you leave . After all , what else can you do ? All of which sounds as if Valentina will go to any lengths not to make a sale . This is n't quite the case . Valentina wants to sell as many dresses as she possibly can and does n't try to limit her clientele to women she feels will make suitable showcases ( socially or physically ) for her creations . On the contrary , she says in her extraordinary pigeon-Russian-English that there is " no one ? absolutely ? I can not make well dressed . " Face . figure . age . manner ? all these are of no consequence . " I could dress anyone ? in whole world , anyone , " she says . Why , then , are strangers gently but firmly given the brush-off ? Because Valentina is one of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originality , her own distinctive . dramatic sweeping lines . She goes to any lengths to protect herself from being prematurely copied and especially from being " copied down . " In France there are copyright laws to protect the great dress designers . Men like Dior and Balmain employ their own detectives to track down and prosecute fashion pirates . But in the United States the laws are not as strict , and Valentina must rely on her own vigilance to keep would-be " spies " from New York 's vast clothing industry from seeing her collection . Later on , she knows , she 's going to be copied anyway and there 's no way to prevent it . A manufacturer need only dine at the Colony or " 21 " to see her gowns on her customers . But by that time her collection has already been seen and bought by the people for whom it is intended . In her shop , then , the rule is : Be careful whom you admit . Always be suspicious of strangers . Valentina 's staff is highly skilled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? as when Bobo and Winthrop Rockefeller walked in and blandly asked to see the collection . Since at that time their engagement had not been made public , they did not give their names . The tall dark man and the blond woman were unknown to the receptionist . In fact to her they looked questionable . She excused herself and put through a quiet telephone call upstairs . She was advised that the unknown pair should not be trusted , and the usual procedure for such cases was suggested . After considerable delay a saleswoman appeared with apologies and two of Valentina 's last year 's creations . It took a while . but eventually the couple were eased out -- never to return . Next day , when someone recognized the pair from a newspaper picture . there was no joy at Valentina 's . If they had given their names . Bobo and Winthrop would , of course , have seen Valentina . But not that day . Like the more successful members of the learned professions , Valentina sees her clients only by prior appointment . Her job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes but to sell the right clothes for every woman who consults her . That involves , in the first place , a careful analysis of each woman 's strengths and weaknesses and then an honest effort to persuade her to select not necessarily the most glamorous or beautiful dress but the one that most becomes her . What , in effect . Valentina does is write a prescription for each customer 's individual fashion problem . That is why she works by appointment only ? to he able to give her entire attention to each of her clients , who number about 200 . It is also why the 34 dresses in her collection sell for from $495 to $995 , and why the tab for a special order ( designed exclusively for the purchaser ) may go as high as $1.300 . Unquestionably , Valentina 's gowns are perfection in design . fabric , workmanship . But hers are n't the only perfect gowns in the city of New York . And other custom designers do n't command such prices . The reason Valentina gets away with her obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her clientele . Perhaps this is her greatest gift . Her customers may not be fond of her . They may not admire the flashy . calculating . frequently disagreeable woman she appears to be . But they are convinced that she and she alone knows how to make them look their best . Valentina personally ? even more than the clothes she designs ? is responsible for that conviction . If you are a new ( and unknown ) customer , all you can expect to accomplish on your first visit to Valentina 's is to make an appointment . By the time you return to keep it , a few discreet phone calls will have been made . Your personal references will have been checked . Your credit rating will have been investigated . Valentina will now have a pretty good idea of the circles you move in and of your potential as far as her business is concerned . She will then know how to approach you . You are ushered up a circular stairway that leads from the reception room to the salon where Valentina sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foyer at the head of the stairs . Behind it stands a brilliantly colored floral screen ? the work of the French artist Bouchene . The salon itself is about 25 by 30 feet . painted gray with white trim and furnished with eighteenthcentury French antiques and big , deepseated divans . There 's very little useless decor , except for three gilded cherubim and some huge shells and chunks of coral . ( People are either flame or water , says Valentina . She is water . ) There are no dresses in sight . No racks . No hangers . No sign of business . except for a box of pins and a bolt of cloth someone has left on a table . The room is not chi-chi . On the contrary . it has the kind of worn and careless elegance of a person who takes his social position completely for granted ? like a man who turns up at a party wearing an old cashmere jacket , patched at the elbows . Valentina herself is definitely not patched , although the clothes she wears at work are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her shop . preferring for more frivolous occasions a wide range of subtle , offbeat colors . She always wears a hat ? the coolie type , which has become her  | trade-mark . She is over fifty , but when you look at her you do n't think of her age . What you notice is the distinguished bone structure of her face and the way she pulls her hair back , emphasizing her high cheekbones . She wears a few jewels ( real , not costume ) ? a diamond Maltese cross on her shoulder and a tremendous blue diamond on her finger . She is Russian , born an aristocrat in the days of the Czar . Her husband and business manager , George Schlee , is likewise Russian . They escaped from the Bolsheviks during the revolution by way of a secret rendezvous with a British destroyer off the Crimea and made their way to Greece , where they lived off the family jewels while Schlee made and lost two fortunes in the Greek period of unrest and inflation that followed World War I. When all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paris , where Schlee made a career for himself as a theatrical producer while Valentina traveled as a variety performer with the Chauve-Souris . In 1923 they got together again to come to the United States with one of Schlee 's plays ? a hit in Paris , a resounding flop in New York . Broke again , with no friends , no contacts , Schlee settled his wife in a two-room Manhattan flat and began to look for work . In a remarkably short time he managed to bring himself to the attention of financier William Durant ( of General Motors fame ) , and one evening found himself entertaining Durant and a group of Durant 's friends at a Russian night club in New York . It was there that the plan for Valentina 's dress salon took shape . The idea had been to discuss a job Durant had in mind for Schlee . By the time the evening was over , the idea had been forgotten . Valentina " happened " to be in the same night club that evening , seated at a nearby table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes for Durant and friends to notice her and begin asking questions . Schlee confessed that Valentina was his wife , that she had designed the dress she was wearing and everything else she owned , that she loved clothes and could n't sew a stitch . Ten hours later the Schlees were in business ? a dowager friend of Durant providing the capital and contacts , the Schlees the talent . From the very beginning Valentina 's prices were outrageous , her success outstanding . But for five years the profits went to various financial backers rather than to the Schlees . In 1928 they were finally able to finance themselves and opened their own shop , a tiny one in their present neighborhood . There they rode out the first years of the depression and by 1932 had managed to accumulate $10,000 , which Schlee promptly invested in a house . George Schlee has a remarkable way with a house . The place on East 78th Street he bought . remodeled and furnished , all with $10,000 , became one of New York 's show places . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerably more than ten times $10,000 and is not only a show place but an art museum . It is built near Manhattan 's East River , overlooking the U.N . and the river . Its rooms are lined with antique handcarved pine paneling . and furnished with fabulous eighteenth-century French and English antiques . Colors are subdued but varied . Fabrics are texture-rich . There are many pictures , many flowers , many crystal chandeliers . The Schlees have no children . Their large , formal living room is a gathering place for adults only . They have many friends , most of whom are people you have heard of , since the Schlees seem to attract celebrities ? or vice versa . Schlee spends his afternoons in the shop . Valentina is there from about ten to five . In July and August they go to Europe , sometimes chartering a yacht for Mediterranean cruising with friends , stopping off in Italy ( especially Venice ) and France . Ashore , they spend a lot of time in the art galleries ? art being Valentina 's chief source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great European dress designers on these trips . Shoptalk is for them a matter of pleasure as well as business . Then , as always , Valentina talks fast , moves about constantly , gestures with broad sweeps of her arms , seldom completes a sentence . When you go to her shop ( if you 're an old customer ) , she swoops down on you and greets you warmly . She compliments you on your outfit . or at least on your shoes and hat . Probably she calls you by your first name , because most of Valentina 's regulars have long since become her friends . ( But not the other way around . Valentina is leery of converting a social relationship into a business one . She can name many members of her own circle whom she does n't , and would n't , dress . ) Then quickly she gets down to business . If you 're a newcomer , there is a slight delay before you look at dresses . Valentina spends fifteen or twenty minutes talking to you , . sizing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasions for which you will be dressing . Eventually she may criticize what you are wearing , and she has been known to take a dress off a customer 's back and send it to her workroom for changes . Ingrid Bergman once came for an appointment wearing a heavily padded suit that made her look unnaturally bulky . When she left , the pads had been removed and Bergman 's stocky frame looked inches smaller . Valentina hates froufrou . She hates fussy clothes . She thinks most American women overdress and most American dresses are overembellished . The way to buy a dress , she says , is not to sell yourself on its strong points but to look objectively at the whole dress and especially to look at yourself in it . " First , " she advises , " quietly put yourself in the mirror . Ask . What I could remove from dress ? ' If nothing should come off , is good dress . " By way of illustration , Valentina dissected the navy-blue shantung dress and jacket this writer was wearing at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cuffs . The same fabric finishes off the horizontal neckline of the dress . When the jacket is worn open , a few inches of pink on the dress are visible . " Is enough pink . " Valentina said . " Take off pink cuffs . Much smarter . " To prove her point , she turned in the cuffs and stood me in front of a mirror . The effect was unquestionably better . For the heavy woman , Valentina believes in long loose lines , to make her look slimmer . She believes in short sleeves for the same reason , pointing out that bare forearms narrow the hips regardless of the cut of the dress . Vertical lines make a stout woman look taller . Horizontal lines seem to shorten and widen a tall person . Regardless of your figure , Valentina believes that the most important rule for being well dressed is to know what you are . That means knowing not only the strengths and weaknesses of your  | figure but also your psychological type and how to dress to it . Valentina advises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of your worst figure faults . If you 're stocky , with a flat chest and wide hips , see whether the dress adds length to your figure . Does it flatter your flat chest ? Does it minimize your wide hips ? What does it do for your too short neck , for your heavy or toothpick legs ? For purposes of comparison , try on your old dress again before you buy the new one and see which does more for what you know to be your weaknesses . Psychologically , the trick is not to try to dress like someone you are n't . If you 're not an outdoors person , do n't dress yourself in severe sport clothes . If you 're cut out for frivolity , dress that way . Do n't ever try to change your type by the clothes you buy . The measure of a good dress is the self-assurance you feel when you wear it . Unless it expresses your real personality , it will make you not confident but uncomfortable . The gowns Valentina designs are all cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to year . Because , as she puts it , they are " architecturally correct , " they wear out long before they go out of style , and it takes many years to wear one out . Norma Shearer , an old friend and customer , turned up one day looking lovely in a Valentina dress Valentina could n't remember . The reason : It was ten years old . The United Nations building , which Valentina loves and sees from her apartment , will never look dated , she thinks . " But look at Queensboro Bridge . Is joke . Is sore eye . " New Yorkers know that bridge as one of the city 's most ornate , a wedding cake in steel . AFTER Valentina has found out what you think you want , she will show you what she has . You see her gowns in the hand , not on a mannequin , because she does n't want you to be fooled by the way someone else looks in a gown instead of concentrating on how you would look in it . Her basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thirty-five and ranges from casual morning cottons to formal ball gowns . She has coats and suits and hats as well , but the latter are made to go with a particular dress and are shown as part of an ensemble . The dresses you are shown are all size 12 ? Valentina 's size ? which means you may not be able to try them on . But most of Valentina 's customers manage to squeeze into the samples and are n't too upset if they ca n't . Such is their confidence in Valentina 's judgment ! In all probability you will not order anything exactly as you see it . Valentina will suggest changes to flatter your figure , or together you will select different fabrics . Possibly Valentina will dream up a completely new gown for the purpose you have in mind . In any case you will not have to worry about meeting yourself at next week 's party . Valentina is careful to steer customers away from dresses their friends have ordered , not to sell the same dress too often in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sold no more than twenty-five times . It is not unusual for a Valentina regular to order as many as twelve or thirteen outfits at one sitting , this being a number that Valentina feels is quite adequate for all occasions for any single season . Out-of-towners ( women come from all over the United States ) may order more . Some of the regulars spend $20,000 a year on their wardrobes . Others get by on three or four outfits a season . Before your appointment is over , a fitter will take your measurements and you will be assigned a time for your first fitting . When you return , you may be in for a surprise . Valentina has been thinking about your needs . She 's perhaps decided that the blue faille you ordered would be better in gray taffeta and that you had better not have the black crepe ? it 's too much like the dress you bought last year . The dresses that are waiting to be fitted represent Valentina 's second thoughts , not necessarily yours . Most of Valentina 's customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all to having their minds thus suddenly changed for them . But some have been known to be outraged , and have taken their business elsewhere . VALENTINA 'S long-established practice of refusing to sell a particularly new and exciting design until after she herself has had a chance to wear it is a more serious point of friction between Valentina and her customers . She justifies her stand by saying that only by wearing a dress can she know whether it is good enough for her customers , but the hard fact remains that Valentina reserves for herself the pleasure of first crack at most Valentina creations . When you come for your fitting , you climb a second flight of stairs and are shown into a roomy but not luxurious fitting room . On the way you may stop for a word with Valentina in her sittingroom-office . If you do , you- will see a room you will not quickly forget . The most unforgettable thing about it is the life-size papier-mache figure that stands facing the door . This figure wears a brown raw-linen tunic with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor . Sometimes its head is draped in a fashion resembling a medieval headdress ; sometimes half its face is concealed by a floppy , broadbrimmed , brown felt hat ? the kind of hat Greta Garbo made famous . ( Garbo is a neighbor and friend of the Schlees . She is dressed by Valentina and looks like her . ) The figure is Valentina 's guinea pig . She drapes fabrics over it , on it , around it . It helps her visualize line , discover how a fabric will handle , how it will fall . It always wears its brown tunic . What else it wears depends on Valentina 's whim . Valentina 's room is not neat . Her desk is more cluttered than clear . There are all sorts of things on her tables . Boxes are piled high inside her fireplace . Bolts of cloth lean in a corner . There are so many things in the room ? so much evidence of the vitality and creativeness of its occupant ? that you are scarcely aware of its handsome eighteenth-century French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although there is one Wols and a drawing of Valentina by her old friend Cecil Beaton . The fireplace is placed along a curved wall , and across from it are two tables , each draped to the floor with cloths ? one off-pink , the other dusty gold . If you stop to visit with Valentina on your way to your fitting , you wo n't stay long . She is not a person to sit and chat but does most of her talking on the wing . In a few minutes someone will call you to your fitting . Although your dresses have been made from scratch , you will probably find the fitting less arduous than many you have experienced in department stores . This is because , before you arrived , most of the work had been done on a dressmaker 's dummy made to your measurements . If you have ordered evening as well as daytime dresses , two forms will have been made . If you were to ask , you might be allowed to see the forms on which your clothing has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stairs to the fourth floor , where Valentina keeps forty-five of New York 's top dress workers busy five days a week , ten months a year . There you would find your dummy , along with scores of others , made out of unbleached muslin and tagged with your name . It might come as something of a shock for you to see your figure reproduced with such brutal accuracy . But then again , it might not ? after you had a look around and read the names on the other dummies : Lillian Gish , Lilli Palmer , Mrs. Robert Sherwood , Mrs. Frank Chapman . the Duchess of Windsor , Mrs. Irene Selznick , Mrs. Jock Whitney , Jennifer Jones , Audrey Hepburn , whose Ondine costumes were designed by Valentina . Y0U GO downstairs to complete your fittings , with Valentina on hand now to make suggestions and minor changes . Valentina sticks by a dress , seeing it through from the time it is first sketched until its final fitting on a customer . At the eleventh hour she often decides to change a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fittings are always needed . It takes about a week , after the final fitting , for your dresses to be finished and delivered to your home . Wearing them for the first time , you will find out for yourself whether Valentina is right when she says that her clothes give a woman a new self-assurance . There remains only to pay the bill , and that wo n't be any problem for you , because if it were , you would never have gone to Valentina in the first place . The only people Valentina ever has trouble collecting from are certain titled Europeans , who sometimes return to Europe leaving unpaid bills behind . For the rest , Valentina 's old customers usually do n't even bother to ask what a dress costs if they like it . And they pay their bills promptly . J. P. Morgan 's famous remark on owning a yacht is singularly applicable to Valentina 's customers . A man who was thinking of buying a yacht once asked the banker how much it cost to operate his Corsair for a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan replied , " you ca n't afford a yacht . "
