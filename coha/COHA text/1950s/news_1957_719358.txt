txt Mechanical " bugs " and cold , gusty winds spoiled the United States effort to shoot the satellite carrying Vanguard rocket into space to , night . Hours of tense waiting for the blastoff came to a disappointing end at 9:40 p. m . Chicago time when word came that the firing had been put off . Zero hour for the shot originally was set for 3 p. m . Then came one postponement after another and finally the decision to put off until another time the attempt to send an American moon into the skies with the Russian sputnik .

It was learned unofficially that replacement of one defective part in the rocket 's intricate mechanism had taken up two hours of time . Then , less than an hour before zero , other troubles popped up . Wind Distressing Factor The wind also was a distressing factor , because any blow over 10 miles an hour could have an effect on the Vangtiard in its upward journey thru the dense lower atmosphere . In an official statement , the defense department said a " series of minor technical adjustments has resulted In the extension of the preparations for firing to the point where test crews are very tired .

It was never resumed . - Valve Proves Problem The shot was called off at 10:15 p. m . E. S. T. after a tele- ' phone consultation between Hagen and the deputy director of the project , J. Paul Walsh , stationed in the blockhouse at Cape Canaveral . Hagen made the announcement of the postponement to reporters who had been keeping long watch hour after hour in Washington at the control center for project Vanguard . He said trouble with operation of a valve was one of the technical difficulties . Asked whether he considered this serious , he replied that it was .

He would n't put it in exact minutes , but said : " We are close enough to be ' disappointed . " Hagen was asked whether the " countdown " preceding the firing , involving a 23 page check list , would have to be repeated in its entirety . He replied that some things probably would not have to be retit ne . In response to a question , Hagen said that it depends on when the process starts up again whether the satellite could be launched tomorrow . He said it was his guess that it " would go back on later in the day so that it would go on tnru " tomorrow night . But Hagen would n't say definitely whether he thought the i launching time would be in the early hours of Friday . Calls News Conference Hagen summoned newsmen into a hurriedly summoned conlerence , after hours of tension : packed waiting by reporters , cameramen , and the project personnel at the Washington headquarters . He read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cape Canaveral test has been postponed and then answered questions . Walsh had told newsmen the odds were 3 to 1 against success of this initial American effort to solve the mysteries of space . Warn Against Optimism In an apparent effort to warn the American public against over optimism , the defense department had stressed repeatedly that there was no assurance the 6.4-inch , radio-equipped satellite in the Vanguard 's nose would go into orbit . The prime purpose of the firing , said the department , was to test the complete launching equipment for the first time , and reaching an orbit would be only a happy circumstance . It 's a normal thing for bugs to be detected in intricate rocket mechanisms during the pre-firing checkups . " Holds " of up to six hours are frequently called .

The Vanguard 's flight into the sky was scheeeled two months after Russia announced that sputnik I was circling the globe . The Reds hurled sputnik II , with its dog rider , into space Nov. 3 . The beeping voices of both sputniks now are silent , their batteries dead . As feverish activity went on inside the top secret missile launching base , there was a carnival atmosphere elsewhere on this oblong island just off the Florida east coast . By 1 p. m. , the " bird watchers " ? civilians who watch the frequent firings of army , navy , and air force missiles from outside the base  --  were turning out in droves . The missiles are commonly known as " birds . " Automobiles lined up along the beaches and the watchers settled down to wait as long as necessary to see the takeoff of the Vanguard . License plates , from New York , Kentucky , and other states testified to the presence of many out of state visitors . Watchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hopeful of getting a shot of the " bird " before it vanished on its southeast course toward the African coast . On " Bird Watch Knoll , " a mound of sand just across a narrow ship channel from the missile firing grounds , newspaper , newsreel , and television cameramen elbowed each other for room . The visiting writers were scattered along the beaches for miles , watching from the sand or from motel roofs and balconies .
