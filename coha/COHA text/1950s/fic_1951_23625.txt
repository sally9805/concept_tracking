I 'll Call You Eager A Story by Glen Haley I T WAS a late spring morning in downtown Los Angeles . There was a breath of summer heat in the coolness of the morning breeze , and an acid edge to the air which brought a little moisture to the eyes of Luetenner Morrison , as he opened up his stand in front of the Mentone . The Mentone was one of the two or three gaunt hotels on Main Street which still retain an air of respectability . Several pensioners could always be seen during the day and evening , wandering along its worn carpets under the dim , old-fashioned lights . It was headquarters for groups of truckers who made the Los Angeles  --  Seattle run , and a small bus line maintained its passenger office in the faded foyer . Luetenner Morrison , a tall Negro with a sardonic smile , had been popping a shoeshine rag in front of the Mentone since he was a snot-nose kid . He was a little over twenty now . It was a three-man stand , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drifted in for a few months a year , and the third chair had a broken footrest . A tattered orange awning sheltered it from the rays of the afternoon sun . A little man with " out-of-towner " written all over him , sidled up to the stand on this particular morning , just as Lue was laying out his rags and brushes . He was short , thin , and his very black face was shaded with a worn felt hat ; he wore a collarless white shirt and bib overalls , both of which were much too big for him , but on his feet were a pair of new army shoes . He watched every move Luetenner made . " Hey you . You want a shine ? " Lue asked the little man , just for a joke . " Oh no . No , " the little man stuttered , and moved back to lean against the wall . By now , the yellow street cars were rambling and racketing down the street as the town awoke ; grifters due back at work on construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cars on lots running through to Spring Street were hurrying by on the way to Eastern Columbia or the May Company . Lue went on about his business , as if no one were watching him . He dialed in a morning music program , climbed up into his chair , and did a few taps . Pretty soon Eckman , the bus company manager with the agency in the Mentone came out , digging at his gold-filled teeth with a toothpick . He was a big well-dressed man . Lue noticed the little man quickly took his hat off as Eckman appeared . Lue climbed down and put on a little show for his spectator . " How about a coupla fast rounds this morning , Mr. Eckman ? " Lue began , shuffling his feet and unlimbering his arms fighter fashion . Eckman pulled his head back and warned , " Look , Jack , some morning I 'll take you up on that , and you 'll be known as ' Punchy ' instead of ' Luc ' around here . " He stepped up and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gabardines while Lue began to dust off his woven-toed oxfords , being careful not to get dirt on the clocked nylon socks . The little black man had taken it all in with his eyes and mouth wide open , Lue noticed . Lue turned toward him and muttered , " Stand back , boy , you bother me . " The little man backed up . Lue said , " So you 're some fighter , Mr. Eckman , huh ? Funny I never read about you in the ring magazines . " Eckman lowered his picture magazine . " Lue , " he said , " did you know I was light heavyweight champion of Pittsburg for several years ? " " Wlioo , " said Lue , touching up the edges of the soles with liquid polish , " some good boys come from around Pittsburgh , Penn . You musta been pretty good , all right . " " Pittsburgh where ? 1 never said anything about Pittsburgh , Penn . " Eckman kicked his foot out at Lue . " I was champion of Pittsburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot and put it back on the footrest . " You kill me , Mr. Eckman , " lie snorted . When Lue had slapped the shoes bright , Eckman handed him a quarter and stepped down . They squared off at each other , and Eckman batted his own nose with his right fist as a fighter does to clear his nostrils ; then they both laughed and stepped back . The white man waved and disappeared inside the hotel . LL cr , this time the little man had been leaning against the wall at the far side of the hotel entrance , looking down at the sidewalk , but glancing up with his eyes wide every so often . Lue started a stick of gum and climbed up into the chair . " Ever treat a white man like that in your country ? " he asked . The little man grinned . " Huh -- uh . No , sir , " he said . " I figure you 's from the South , all right , " Lue said . " I come from good plantation folks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lue 's smile pulled the corners of his mouth down . He began to clean his fingernails . " How come you out here ? " he inquired . The little man altered the position of his feet , took off his hat , and scratched his head . " Well , " he said finally , " I guess you might say the reason we is here is because my wife she got ambition . " He rushed on to amend , " I got it , too , but she got it more . " " Huh , " Lue grunted , " sound like some kind of a disease to me . " " It 's just that old ' keep agoin ' feelin ' , " the little man explained . " In other words you 're ' eager , . - " May  --  maybe so . " " That 's what I 'll call you  --  Eager , " Lue stated . " My name is Wendell Travis , " the little man supplied quickly . " Okay , " Lue assented . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old ' keep agoin ' feelin ' out here in L.A. ? " " We gon na get ahead and live like people out here do . " " What on ? " " We gets started . My wife got a job in a laundry now . " Lue sucked air between his large front teeth . - She good-looking ? " " My wife ? Oh yes . She 's a very nicelookin ' woman , my wife is , " the little man replied hastily . Lue grinned . " How come she take on a skinny little runt like you if she so pretty ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I 'm steady . And I got ambition too . " Lue shook his head . " Huh . You better go see can you get a cure from that . No colored man got no business with ambition , anyway . " After a silence , Lue stretched , and did a little advertising for his stand : " Get ya shine here . Shine , Mister ? Shine ' em up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers stopped by , both strangers to Lue . He handled them both at the same time . Then Mr. Cooper sidled out of the hotel . Mr. Cooper dressed in a black suit so shiny in places that it looked brown . He was old , near-sighted , and slightly stooped . Mr. Cooper owned the Mentone , but he did n't like anyone to know it , because it made for trouble . He always pretended to be representing his sister , who lived in the East and really owned the hotel ; but someone a long time ago had learned that his sister was dead . Mr. Cooper sat in the lobby during the mornings , reading papers so continuously that all that could be seen of him was the spread-out papers grasped by his thin , trembling fingers , and his long legs , one draped over the other so that the wrinkled gray sock was exposed as well as a length of thin shank almost transparent it was so white . Lue helped Mr. Cooper up to the chair . " How 's your sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked with his usual politeness , " Oh yes . My sister is very  --  very well , " Mr. Cooper quavered the usual response , and added the usual postscript , " Watch that bunion on the right foot , Luetennet . " Lae went over the old black kangaroo leather shoes with his usual care .. During tie process Mx . Cooper complained about Ile shoddy appearance of the stand , and Lue , , as he had been doing for years , promised to dean it up . After Mr. Cooper was gently helped down , Lue brushed him off with a brush kept for that exclusive purpose . He then refused the dime Mr. Cooper profferell with his usual , " No , sir , Mr. Cooper ; your money is no good here . " After he had gone , Lue explained to his visitor : " He own this hotel , that man does . I always shine him free . One time I took his dime , and he look like he gon na choke me with his bare hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who went by were not " shiners . " Pimps and panhandlers were making the rounds ; Mexican women were going home from trading at the big Third Street market , and the kids on the street corners were half-heartedly trying to unload their remaining morning papers . The little man still leaned against the wall . As Lue looked over at him , he looked quickly down and altered his position . " Eager , you got anything you need to do ? " he inquired . " Me ? " the little man stuttered , " I 'm  --  I'm-I ' m ? " " I mean right now  --  right this minute . " " No , " the little man said . " Well , Took here . Suppose you looks after this stand for me for a minute , will you ? I mean don ' touch a damn thing , but in case a customer shows , you run right clown the street to that parking lot and let me know  --  will your " Oh yes , six . I surely will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe I set you up to a cup of coffee when I gets back , " he stretched , and added languidly , as part payment . on the service about to be rendered , " Me ' and a by named MAGAZINE Mack down there at the car lot is double-dating a couple of city government girls . " " Oh , I see , I see , " Eager responded , properly impressed . " 01 ' Mack , he always takes me and Bonnie home first , so about this time of day we gets together to compare notes . " He winka-ri , and walked away , while the little two nodded rapidly and smiled , The little man x  --  i.hom Lue called rarger remained until Lue rel. - coned , and in tact leas there throughout the - entire day , nue even leaving , as far as Ltre could see ? chrrizig any part of the lunch hour . He had a sandwich with him wrapped in a cloth , which he ex , - tracted from one of his huge back overall pockets . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once Lue had come hack from the parking lot he was clone with the little man , and he did n't pay any more atten tion to him . Traffic gradually picked up through the afternoon , the ball game began and ended , and the returns came in from Santa Anita . The tide of homebound workers set in . Lue pulled the grading across the stand and got into his red gabardine jacket . " Well , Eager , " he addressed the little man , who was now squatting on his haunches by the wall , " we done a day 's work . Do n't you ' spect we better go home ? " The little man pulled himself up , stretched , and smiled . Luc walked over to Hill Street to catch a red car home . He saw Eager hurrying along behind him , but he soon lost track of him , and in fact had forgotten him entirety , until he was standing in the streetcar waiting zone and happened to see the smaller man standing near hirn . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think you 're goin ' home with me too , for the Lord 's sake ? " Eager smiled apologetically . " Oh no , no . But to tell the truth , I do n't exactly --  " All right , " said Late , with his fiSiSi on his hips , " let 's have it . You do n't know how to get home , do you ? " The small man 's smile had turned , a little forlorn , " Codamighty how they evel come to let you out of Arkansaw. , , nester know , " Lue muttered . The little man hesitantly held aft an envelope with an address scribbled on iu Lao grimteri " You lives down in there , huh . You got to take a seven car and fir . Here come one now . " He gave Eager a shove . " Now listen . When you gets on , tell the conductor you 's from Arkansaw and you do n't know your hind end from a hole in the ground . Maybe he 'll fix you up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even then the motorman had to say , " All aboard , " twice . Lue watched the car leave , shaking his head . 1 UE was out late that night and did n't get to work until after eight . As he turned the corner south of the Mentone , he saw the figure in the felt hat , collarless white shirt , and faded overalls waiting for him , in the same attitude as the day before . For Christ 's sake , " Lue said when he came up , ' ' am I goin ' to have to work you over to get rid of you ? " " I 'm sorry , " the little man stuttered . " I did n't go to make trouble . I 'll take my leave . I 'll take my leave right now . " Lue looked at him a minute and snorted . Then he laughed noiselessly . " Well , " he said , " I guess I do n't really give a damn if you hangs around . ' Fore God I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of me and my customers ' way. - People began to notice Eager this second day . Eckman had a wisecrack or so , and Lue then gave a thumbnail description of his visitor which was good for a laugh . This proved fortunate for the little man  --  he was good to have around for laughs . Eager ( as he became to everyone except Mr. Cooper , who called him Wendell ) was so ignorant of all aspects of city life that nearly every response or question elicited from him , caused merriment among Lue 's customers and friends . He gradually assumed duties in addition to the one of looking after the stand while Lue went down to talk to his friend Mack . The first of these was brushing off the customers . This came about one morning through Eckman 's inquiring , " Why do n't you make a porter out of that boy , Lue ? Brush me off , Eager . " Eager 's desire to please was frantic , and when he had finished , Eckman pulled back his shoulders and exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He knocked more kinks out of my backbone with that whiskbroom than a chiropractor could with both hands and a knee . Here 's a dime , Eager , but it 's worth a dollar . " Thus , - the whiskbroom reserved for Mr. Cooper came into active service , and Eager realized his first monetary returns from his days of waiting . Eager gradually gained more duties . The main one was looking after Mr. Cooper . Eager helped him up to the chair , fetched his paper from the lobby , and rolled up the cuffs of the shiny black trousers . Moreover , Mr. Cooper was responsible for Eager 's actual elevation into the position of a full-time bootblack . One day , the old man came out late for his shine , and Lue returned from the parking lot to find Eager busy among the brushes , tins , and bottles , actually working on Mr. Cooper 's shoes . Lue 's first impulse was to knock the little man stem-winding , but he controlled himself with an effort , and said , " Good morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Cooper he ask me would I go over his shoes against you comin ' back . I tell him I better run and fetch you , but he say ' no ' . " From behind his paper , Mr. Cooper remarked , " I just wanted a little clean-up : Wendell can do it all right . " Lue contained his exasperation . " Well , all right , Mr. Cooper . I 'll see he carries it out okay this time . " Afterward , Lue said , " Seem to me there 's such a thing as gettin ' a little too eager . " Eager stuttered , " Well , Mr. Cooper he own the hotel and that 's the God 's truth that he make me go ahead . I figure you do n't want him mad . " Lue shook his head . " Sometimes I wonder what in the God 's world I would do without you any more  --  and other times I would sure like to find out . " W ITHOUT Lue 's doing anything about it one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoeshining operation , not only for Mr. Cooper , but for other customers , on a percentage basis . The usual Main Street price was fifteen cents . Lue took ten cents out of Eager 's gross " for expenses . " He also had a deal on those who came to the stand as Lue 's " bona fide customers . " He had put it up to Eager as a proposition : " Look , Eager , time will come if you has any knack at all , when you gon na have customers of your own ; now , if you looks after mine , look after yours when you gets some  --  okay ? " The little man gained in confidence , but there were setbacks . He was unable to develop a " line " to entertain the trade as Lue had . He would try to joke but it came out a little sour . Once to Mr. Cooper he had said , " Well , Mr. Cooper , sir , you lookin ' mighty gay . I suppose you 's enjoying life this morn-ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Cooper looking " gay . " Mr. Cooper stared morosely at the little man and did n't dignify the remark with any reply at all . Later , Lue told Eager , " Listen , you tryin ' too hard . People do n't like to have you waggin ' around like a little old puppy dog . You just shine shoes and smile , and leave the entertainment to me . " There were other changes in Eager . Though he seined to have an endless supply of the oversized collarless white shirts , he discarded the faded overalls and wore a type of work pants which Lue called " J. C. Penney twills . " He polished his army shoes until they glowed ; the old felt hat remained , but it was only worn to and from the stand . And he began an irritating practice of suggesting improvements to Lue  --  he mentioned the tattered awning , and the broken footrest on the third chair . When Lue was sufficiently annoyed , he would put a period to the remarks by saying , " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working here . " But for the most part Lue paid his co-worker little attention . At this time his thoughts were becoming more and more occupied with woman trouble . Mack had had a falling out with his government girl , but Lue was still seeing his . This entailed difficulties , since Mack had a car and Lue was n't in a position at the time to afford one . Besides , he was certain that his girl , Arvada , was also dating some man with an office job on Central Avenue . Much of Lue 's spare time in these days was spent sitting sideways in his chair with one leg swinging across the arm rest , while he plucked at his lip . S EVERAL weeks after Eager had begun shining shoes , Lue met the little man 's wife . Lue came back to the stand in mid-afternoon one day to see Eager in close consultation with a small , slender woman , whom he at once knew must be Mrs , Wendell Travis . She seemed to be talking quite heatedly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came up he was introduced . " Lue , this is my wife Bessie , " Eager said . Bessie was very plainly but tidily dressed . She said , in a voice that was somewhat high and loud , " How do you do , Mr. Morrison . I 'm mighty pleased to know you. , " " Same here , " Lue responded . " You got you a day off from the laundry ? " " That 's right , Mr. Morrison , " she said . She was not had looking , but the veins stood out too plainly in her neck , and her hands and feet ' were large for her size . Her eyes were pretty , Lue decided , but there was a set to her chin and mouth that he could do without . She was n't his kind of woman , he knew that : she was a driver , and what she said next proved it : " Mr. Morrison , there is a little matter of business me and Wendell would like to talk over with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over as his wife was . He moved away , plainly upset . " Yeah ? " Lue said , sitting down in his chair . He had a pretty good idea of what was coming . " Wendell has been here some time , and now that he knows the business , we feel ? " " Eager ai n't doin ' bad , maybe , " Luc interrupted , " but he ai n't exactly an old hand , and he took a lot of my time pickin ' it up . " " Well , anyways , " she continued , unabashed , " we was wondering if maybe you could see your way clear to givin ' him maybe a little more money a shine  --  on his own customers that is . " Her tone implied that she felt this to be a matter of right . Lue 's temper began to take hold , but he had a way of acting humorous when he got mad . He replied by turning to the husband , " Eager , I did n't understand that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man scratched above his ear in an unhappy way . " Oh , he ai n't dissatisfied , Mr. Morrison : he ai n't at all ; but he 's a family man , you know , and ? " " I hate to lose you , " Lue said , ignoring the wife , " especially after all the trouble I 've had breaking you in , but I can see you better look around and try to better yourself . Besides , I got me another man that usually shows up about , this time of year . I wo n't expect you in tomorrow . We 'll check up on the polishes tonight . " Meanwhile , Lue reached over and turned up the radio , which began blaring out the ball game , Mrs. Travis continued talking , but Lue just nodded pleasantly and said , " The same to you , Mrs. Travis , just drop in any time  --  even if your husband ai n't workin ' here any more . " So ended Lue 's first meeting with Eager 's wife . Nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lue had no intention of changing the arrangement with Eager , and if he had , it would not have been feasible just at this time . His girl was planning a vacation in San Bernardino , and if he was not able to go with her , he was pretty certain she would find other company . Finally she left town without him , but left her address behind . Lue followed the next day and partied there with her , but when they returned to Los Angeles , there was a. final disastrous argument . Arvada told him she was marrying an insurance man , and Lue used the rest of the money he had been able to rake together for the excursion for a real two-day drunk . By the time he was off the merry-go-round , he had been away from the stand for over two weeks . H E WOKE up on a Tuesday about ten o'clock . There was a note from the landlady under his door . It was about overdue rent . Lite pulled out a last cigarette with shaking fingers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets with eyes he had trouble trying to focus properly . He decided he would go down and open up the stand for a couple of hours . In the stress of the past two weeks , he had forgotten about Eager ; or if he thought of him it had not occurred to him that the little man would be carrying on at the stand alone . When he saw the stand was open , he was not sure whether he was pleased about it or not . Even from half a block away , the place looked somewhat different . He puzzled this out : Eager had repaired the rent in the awning , and given the stand a new coat of paint ; and as he came nearer he saw that another man was at work in front of the chair that had had the broken footrest . Hesuddenly began to be annoyed and worried . The new man turned out to be the Wino , who must now be ready for a brief turn at regular employment . The broken footrest had been repaired . The Wino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoes of one of Lue 's regular customers . Lue walked up beside the little man . " I take over , Eager boy , " he said . " Hi , " Eager responded , and moved to one side , but not very fast . Luetenner had to nudge him a little . As he batted the shoes with a rag he looked over at the Wino and inquired , " How come you workin ' here without my permission ? " The Wino , who seldom spoke anyway , merely shrugged . When the customer had gone , Eager said : " You been all right ? " " Oh no , I been sicker'n a dog , " Lue answered , and he looked at Eager and smirked . " Sure sorry to hear that . " " You do n't have to be sorry , " Lue responded , " it 's a damn lie . " Lue climbed up and sat down in his chair . He regarded the patched awning glumly and looked over at the welded footrest on the third chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he remarked . A quick smile came to Eager 's face , but it disappeared as he saw the expression on Lue 's . Lue abruptly stepped down and began sorting through his equipment . He turned on Eager , " How come you take my polish ? " " I just use it in case it gets old , " Eager began , " I was gon na put more in . " " Damn right you was  --  and is , " Lue said shortly . " Look , " Eager quavered , " ai n't no call for you to be so sour with me . I been doin ' the right thing . I been lookin ' after your customers all the time you been gone . I kept accounts . I owes you sixty-four dollars . " Lue felt a sudden stab of delight . He had forgotten that he would have money coming . But he gave no sign . " Yeah , " he said , " I bet you do . " " No , " protested Eager , " that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can throw that book in the ashcan , " Lue told him . " I keeps it in my head , and you do n't put nothing past me . " He felt considerably better . " Where you got my cash ? " he asked . Eager extracted the bills from his old-fashioned deep pocketbook , and handed them over . Lue jammed them into his pocket . Lue noticed throughout this first day that Eager had acquired new customers . He also noticed at noon that Eager now owned a vacuum bottle . " Hey , some class ! " he exclaimed . Eager carefully poured a cupful of buttermilk , replaced the cork , and said with dignity , " It does make eatin ' a little bit more of a real pleasure . " The afternoon was typical for the stand . Lue was glad to be back in the old run of things . The baseball game came on , and afterward the races . Around six he folded up his rags and stored his brushes with a feeling of being pleasantly tired . Next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey chump  --  I mean champ  --  where you been ? " " Around , " grinned Lue . " Was it wine , women , song , or all three ? " " Well , I tell you for sure , there was too much women mixed in it . " For the time being , Lue was happy enough to be back and at work , and he might have gone on for some time without discovering the fundamental change that had come about in the affairs of the stand , had he not decided about midmorning of this second day to go down to the parking lot and see Mack . It was after he had given his buddy the lowdown on the San Bernardino party that Mack asked . " How you and Eager makin ' out ? " " We 're just about makin ' to make out . " " You mean you 're leavin ' ? " " Me ? Leave my own stand ? You got rocks between your ears ? " " You better shake your own head . I ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard yet , I guess , have you ? " " Heard what ? " Lue asked . " You 're way behind the times , " Mack said , but then there was a rush of cars and Lue could n't get any more out of him . He went back to the stand . He knew something was up , but he was n't sure what . The Wino had a customer . Lue sat in his own chair , doing nothing , while Eager cleaned up a pair of white shoes left on call . Lue pulled at his lower lip and began tothink back over events . Eager had paid him willingly enough , but what had he . paid ? Why , he had only paid for doing the work on Lue 's customers . There was still the dime for each of Eager 's own customers . And what about the Wino ? He always paid a nickel a shine to Luc . It all came over him with a rush . ' Where had all that money gone ? What a fool he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rag and snapped it a moment , figuring out how to open the subject . He had to make it natural and easy . Finally he said , " Well , Eager , when we finishin ' our financial ' over the time I was gone ? " Eager looked up . He drew a deep breath and laid a shoe down slowly and carefully . " I done paid you . " LU E doubled up his fist , and then relaxed it . " Sure . You pay inc for my customers . How about my cut on yours ? " Eager picked up the shoe again . " I ca n't afford no such rate as that any more . There 's rent to pay . " " Who in hell cares what you ca n't afford ? What rent you talkin ' about  --  you mean house rent ? " Eager drew in his breath slowly . " I  --  I mean rent on the stand here . " " Rent ? " Lue stared . " Who in hell payin ' rent ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why , to Mr. Cooper , the owner of this hotel , that 's who . " " Boy , " said Lue , throwing down his rag , " it 's a good thing you fix that tear in the awning , but it looks like you done it too late . You got a heat stroke or something for sure . " But he remembered uneasily that when Mr. Cooper had come around for his shine that morning , he had stared at Lue and had barely nodded and that he had addressed Eager as " Wendell . " Of course , the old man had always called Eager " Wendell , " but still . . . . Lue scrambled down and went into the lobby to see Mr. Cooper . One of Mr. Cooper 's skinny , glistening white shanks was exposed above a wrinkled gray sock as he sat reared back , behind his paper . " That 's right , " he said in his high unpleasant voice in response to Lue 's question . I 'LL CALL " Wendell is paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wendell . He 's leased the equipment out there , and he 's paying sixteen dollars a month on it . " " Great gobs of fire , " Lue exploded , " how come he leases it ? He do n't own that stand  --  I do . " " Well , that 's where you 're mistaken , " Mr. Cooper said , his head bobbling slightly under the stress of his exaggerated calm . " Who did you ever buy it from ? " " I never bought it , " Lue spluttered , " I  --  I just always had it , that 's all . " " The stand , " Mr. Cooper pointed out the facts with a long finger on the arm of his **25;1083;TOOLONG chair , " belonged to old Homey Johnson and when he died you worked there . Have you got any papers to show you own that stand ? " As Mr. Cooper looked up out of shrewd watery eyes , Lue 's confidence in his . position ebbed away . That stand had always been his ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of dry land upon which lie had stood , while the Hood waters of life rushed hungrily by on both sides . Now the land was washed away . " I never need any papers before , " he said slowly . " How come I need ' em now ? " " Well , " Mr. Cooper rustled his paper , and crossed his legs again , " you never did right out there , Lue . That stand was an eyesore and a disgrace to my sister 's hotel until Wendell came along . He 's taken ahold and made it look right . While you were gone , I talked it over with Wendell and his wife and we drew up a lease . As far as that goes , none of us knew that you would ever come back , did we ? " Lue drew himself up and flexed his arms . " God damn , God damn , " he muttered in a choking voice . " Now , no cursing in here , " Mr. Cooper exclaimed , putting out a trembling hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And no cursing outside , and no trouble ! " he dimly heard Mr. Cooper warning in his high voice . 0 trrsr-DE , Eager looked up once , and then kept his eyes lowered , Lue was too mad to know just what to do . Eager was still working on the pair of white shoes . Lue leaned on his chair , bracing his head On his hand and he kept his eyes on Eager . " You sure did it to me , did n't you " he murmured , " you sure did . You sure cut a slice off a fat pig . " The little man was trying with awkward fingers to open a tin - Of polish , " Here , leunne help , " Lue said gently . He took the tin from Eager ' and threw it dOwn on the sidewalk as hard as he could . ' The top sang off and whirled into the gutter . A newsboy sidled up and a few people stopped to look . The Wino watched impassively from his chair . Mr. Cooper was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered to his hips . A cop strolled by . Luc - went back to leaning on his chair . " Everything here is yours , now , " he said in a conversational way . " I worked here nine years , but I been moved down and out . " " No you ai n't , " Eager protested in a tight voice , as he picked up the polish , " you can stay here if you wants to . " " And pay you rent ? " " And pay Mr. Cooper rent . " " Boy , I would see you in the deep bottom of hell first . " A customer came in and Eager started to work on his shoes . It did n't matter to Lue . He stood quietly again , and then he spoke again , with a little crooked smile on his face . " Boy , you sure did take me in , Wendell . You told me you was eager , but you was such a seedy lookin ' little twerp that I never paid it any mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me like that . How you did take me . I bet that wife of yours is surely proud of you . " Lue passed his hand back and forth on either side of his chin . There were several things he could do . He could beat Eager within an inch of his life . He could leave . Or he could knuckle under . Beating up the little shrimp might mean trouble , maybe jail . But leaving ! It seemed impossible just to walk away from his own stand . What would he do ? Where would he go ? And still , staying and knuckling under was out of the question . A hot wave passed over him and he felt like picking up the chair and making a shambles of the stand . The fingers of both hands closed on the chair , but his hot eyes looked right into those of ML Coope , valo still stood looking out the door of the hotel . Lite released his hold on the chair . He put a foot up on the end of the stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tense all over . He stood for half an hour like this . Eager tried desperately to keep busy all this while . A customer came , and his fingers were all thumbs . Afterward he tried whisking the dirt out from under his chair , but his hand was trembling so that he could hardly hold the broom . Gradually , as Lue watched , a smile appeared on the big man 's face . He spoke finally , You know , Wendell , now that I do n't have a single damn thing to do , I figure the best thing I can do would be to just stick around and see you work . Now you been here upwards of two months , and see what you already done . I just undervalued that ambition stuff all to hell . I got a lot to learn , I see that now , and you is exactly the boy to teach it to me . " Eager did some half-hearted advertising , Shine . Get your shine . Shine . " Lue just kept leaning on the stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the entire day . Lue stayed around his chair , but he did not do one thing . Several times when customers tried to sit in his chair he told them politely , " I ai n't working here any longer , sir , but Wendell here , the Arkansaw wonder , he will gladly look after you . He does a fine job , very fine . Only count your change as you leave . " It gave Lue a great deal of wicked enjoyment to see how nervous the little man remained . He dropped things , and occasionally his rag slipped off a shoe . Along toward closing time , Eager said , " I do n't understand why you acting this way . I did n't do anything . Mr. Cooper , he ? " " No , you little black bastard , " Lue said , his pretended good humor swallowed up in a rush , " you did n't do nothing . You just took away my living , that 's all you did . " " No , I never . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my stand or I 'll break that chair on you , " Lue warned , in words that tumbled over each other . He shook his head , his fists clenched . He ground his teeth . " God knows I ai n't a man to turn down easy money , but I never in my life would pull a dirty little old stinking trick like youpulled . " Then he rubbed his chin again and reassumed his pretended good humor . " But you was so right , Eager boy . So right . That 's just exactly how to get ahead in this town of L.A. or in the whole big old world , to boot . You taught me a wonderful lesson . It 's a lesson I surely got to dwell on . I 'm really grateful to you , little Eager boy . " He went on more slowly . " Only thing is , I ai n't exactly sure I knows the ropes good enough to strike out on my own . So I think ill just hang around you for a while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out exactly all I can about how a really get-ahead , eager-heaver boy operates . " " There just ai n't any sense to all this , " Eager said weakly , but Lue remained . When the stand closed down at six-thirty , the Wino watched Eager walk away , with his old felt on his head , and a coat slung over his shoulder country style , while Lue strode a step behind him , in his red gabardine jacket and pork-pie hat . TI , j'E followed him to the streetcar , got an identical transfer with that of his com- panion , and stood beside him in the car . They got off together and Eager walked nervously up the street toward the 1890 vintage mansion in which he and his wife and child occupied a housekeeping room . At the huge , paint-peeled front door , which stood ajar , Eager turned and looked at Lue . Lue said , " Well , I 'll see you tomorrow , little Eager man . Let 's see . You gets down to the stand around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must leave here at 6:30 and catch the 6:35 trolley  --  that right ? " Two children on roller skates swayed past them out of the echoing house , and behind them came Mrs. Travis , holding the hand of her little girl . " GoorEevening , Wendell , " she said crisply , leaning toward him ; she saw Lue and withdrew her cheek . Her eyes seemed to cloud over a second , like those of a hawk . " You remembers Mr. Morrison , " Eager mumbled . " Wo n't you come in , Mr. Morrison ? " she asked . Lue smiled a refusal and the four of them stood there awkwardly a couple of minutes . Wendell half whispered to his wife , " Let 's go in . " I 'LL CALL Lue tipped his hat . " I 'll see you in the morning , Eager . " They went into the house . The last Lue saw of them was the shine of Mrs. Travis ' large dark eyes , as she shepherded her daughter out of sight . Lue went across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood grocery . He saw the shadow of Wendell 's wife against the curtain of a second-story window of the old house , and he tipped his hat to it . The sound of some high-pitched conversation carried to him after the shadow had turned abruptly away . He hung around twenty Minutes longer , and went home . At a quarter after six the next morning , Lue arrived at the stoop of Eager 's home . He was gratified to see Eager come out almost immediately , apparently intending to catch an earlier car than usual . The little man was followed by his wife , who was saying in a low , intense voice to her husband , " just do n't let him bother you , honey . When he finds out he ca n't get your goat , he 'll quit , you 'll see . " Both were startled as Lue stood up from where he had been sitting on the step below them . " Well good morning there , ma'am , " Lue called ; but she looked at her husband and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went quickly back into the house . Eager walked down the steps with eyes lowered in a troubled , tired face . Lue followed him to the trolley , talking in a companionable way , but Eager did not respond . All day at the stand , Lue stood around watching the little man work . Occasionally he joined in helping him promote business : " Come in and get a shine from the most eager boy on Main Street . He aims to get ahead and he 'll do it , too . He 's a big business man from Arkansaw on his way up . Get his autograph while there 's still time . " Lue took a Tittle time off around noon of this day to go down to the car lot . He did n't care now if Mack kidded him a little . He was having such a good time needling Eager that he was in high spirits , even if he was getting down to the spare change in his pockets . Later he went back to the stand and continued to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day the little man was showing definite signs of strain . The Wino , too , seemed somewhat upset by the situation . Toward the end of the afternoon he rolled up his kit in his apron , mumbled something about an " errand , " and disappeared . Lue went home again with Wendell after work . Wendell plodded along with his head down , never answering any of Lue 's companionable sallies . This time , though Mrs. Travis appeared at the door promptly , neither Wendell nor his wife spoke to Lue , but both went directly into the house , Mrs. Travis showing some concern over her husband . A few moments later , Mrs. Travis came out and shouted across to where Lue was standing by the grocery store . The roller-skating children stopped on the walk to listen , and heads appeared at windows . " Have n't you got anything better to do than follow my husband around ? " she called . " I surely ai n't , ma'am , " Lue said cheerfully , " not any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish way for you to act ? " " Well , " called Lue , " it 's like I told your husband . Eager is a get-ahead boy with ambition , and I need a few pointers . Here I go along nine years in the same place and Eager comes along and yanks my stand out from under me overnight . " " He never yanked it out from under you . It was n't his fault that ? " " That 's right , ma'am , " Lue interrupted , " it ai n't Eager 's fault he 's so eager . " " Oh , eager  --  eager  --  eager , " she screamed . " You better stay away from here . I do n't want to see you around here again . " T HE next morning , at the door of the time-scarred mansion , Lue awaited the appearance of his small victim . Eager soon came out , looking like a prisoner about to walk a gantlet . Mrs. Travis kissed her husband , and as the two men walked away , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . I 'm gon na put a stop to it . You hear me ? " At the stand , the day was uneventful . The Wino did not come to work . Eckman , the bus station manager , came out , but Lue remained sprawled in his chair . Eckman 's brows came down in a frown . " Well , how about it ? " he inquired . " I do n't work here any more , Mr. Eckman , " Lue explained languidly . " Eager is your man . Arkansaw 's finest . " " All right , " said Eckman , and read his magazine without comment . Mr. Cooper did not come out for a shine . but Lue saw him come to the hotel door occasionally through the morning and regard him suspiciously , his newspaper clutched in one bony ' hand ; the cop walked by and looked Lue over in a way that indicated that he had already been warned to watch out for trouble . Toward the middle of the afternoon , Eager sat down in his chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Eager , " Lue chided him , " you slipping , you know . I begin to think you ai n't the hot number I figures you for . Ai n't you gain ' to show more action than that ? " Eager looked up at him out of red-rimmed eyes , without changing expression , and then looked down again . Lue glumly listened to the ball game and the race results , and tapped out the rhythm of a jazz tune . The little game he had been . playing had begun to pall on him . He took little pleasure , even , in the fact that Eager was now moving around like an automaton , and doing a listless , sloppy job on the shoes lie was called upon to shine . Lue went home again with Eager , but it was for the last time , he told himself . At the stoop , Mrs. Travis put her arm around her husband as lie plodded up the steps , and shouted at Luc , " Look here now . I warned you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , said distinctly , " Shut up . " His wife turned on him in amazed disbelief . " What ? " she asked . " Just shut up , " Eager repeated , and walked on by her into the house . Lue waited awhile in front of the grocery store across the street . Somehow , he had a feeling that something was going to happen . And sure enough , after about half an hour , Wendell reappeared in the doorway of the old house . He stood there a moment , as if he might turn around and go back into the house . He put one hand on the door frame and then walked out and across the street . He looked neither to right nor to left ; a boy on a bicycle MAGAZINE barely avoided him . He came up to Lue and stood in front of him , trembling . He licked his lips . " What 's the trouble , Eager boy ? " Lue asked soothingly . " You look all upset . " Eager had difficulty getting the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's fight . " Lue said , " Pardon me , Eager , but I had a little trouble gettin ' that . I thought you said , ' Let 's fight ' . " " That 's what I did say . " The little man 's words now came in a breathy rush . " That 's what you been tryin ' to do all along , is get me mad so you could fight me . Now I say come ahead . " Lue looked at him a moment , and his lips curled down . " I bet she put you up to this , did n't she  --  Mrs. Travis , that is . " " No she never . It 's my own idea . Let 's get it over with . " Lue stood there . He began to laugh soundlessly . Wendell struck out wildly ; Lue fended him off and went on laughing . He circled around , avoiding the wild blows , unable to control his laughing . People were gathering across the street . Lue grabbed the small man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " I 've had enough . I 've had enough . " He was still laughing . He towered his head . Finally he let go of Eager 's arms . " Whoo , " he gasped admiringly , " what a killer . " As he stood there , the little man lashed out again and this time he caught the larger man on the cheek with a solid , bruising blow . Lue 's laughter stopped . His anger rose quickly but instead of hitting the smaller man , he pushed him suddenly and Eager fell heavily in the street . Lue stood there , hands doubled into fists and his arms churning to and fro along his sides . Then he straightened his shoulders , and as Wendell got up he was smiling again , but not so pleasantly as before . Still , there was a certain respect in the way he looked at Eager , who glared stonily back at his tormentor . Lue went away then , with the mutter of the crowd which had gathered sounding faintly in his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went to a nearby liquor store , bought a pint of orange gin , and went home to his room . For some reason he was disgusted with himself . I 'LL CALL H E WOKE later than usual the next morning , and got up and dressed . He decided he wanted to visit the stand for the last time ; he no longer had any particular feeling in the matter , but lie wanted to show his face once more and then forget the whole thing . Shortly after 1 , ue arrived , Mr. Cooper came out , agitated . " Are you working here ? " Mr. Cooper asked . " No , " said Lue . " Well if you 're not working here , what are you doing here ? " " I 'm just lookin ' on . " " What do you mean , looking on ? " " Just Iookin ' on . " " Wendell , " Mr. Cooper demanded , " what is he doing around here ? " Eager had not turned around as the two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged . " Well , " concluded Mr. Cooper testily , " I want you boys to get all this straightened out . I do n't believe you 're doing any good around here , " he told Lue , " and I know you are n't working . It 'll only lead to trouble . " The small man spoke . " It 'll get straightened out . " " Well , if it does n't I may just close the stand up or move it away , " Mr. Cooper quavered . " I 'm tired of fretting over it . " He stumped inside , glared out through the glass door , and turned away as he opened up the morning newspaper . Lue swung his leg languidly as he sat in his chair . " So you think you 're gon na get things straightened out , do you , Eager boy , " he said . The little man 's voice in answer was tight but resolute . " I think it can be straightened out . " He continued dusting out the area underneath his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor of the stand . Eager talked on , without looking at Lue . " I know you figure I did you a dirty trick when I took over the stand . " " Oh no , now , Eager , " Lue began . " Oh shut up all your damn foolishness , " Eager said , straightening up and trembling with rage , " I do n't want to hear any more of your damn silly humor . " " Well , " said Lue , covering his mouth with his hand and looking humble , " I 'll stop then . I do n't want to have any more trouble with you . Not after the way you handled yourself last night . " " Oh sure , I know you could break me in two if you wanted , " Eager interrupted roughly , " but you got to admit I stood up to you . " " Yes , you did that , Eager boy , you sure did , and I do n't know yet why I did n't pick you up and bust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was thinking of your wife . " " Oh , pshaw , " Eager snapped , " you hates my wife , I know that . You figure she set me on to take over the stand . WelI maybe she did . But I told her off last night . " " You did , huh . " Lue looked bored . " Yes I did . I told her I was going to ask you if you would be my partner in this stand . " " Be your partner ! " Lue sat straight up . " You little rat ! If it was n't for you , we would still be gettin ' this stand free . You sure hockeyed in the nest , did n't you , you wall-eyed little cuckoo . " " All right , maybe I did , " Eager shouted , loudly enough so that Mr. Cooper appeared with paper lowered , behind the hotel door . The little man lowered his voice . " Maybe I did , but you did n't treat me so good , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shinin ' steady here . You did n't want nothin ' for nobody but yourself . Everybody makes mistakes , but anyway I 'm tryin ' to do the right thing , I ca n't do no more than that . " " If I was to do the right thing , " Lue growled , " I 'd uppercut you clear out into the street . " " Come down here and do it , then , " shrilled Eager . " Nobody can get nothin ' through your head . Come on ! " Lue glowered at the quivering little man a moment , then his lips turned up at the corners in spite of himself . Mr. Cooper still stood inside the door , as Eckman , the bus company passenger agent , came up . He started to step up into Eager 's chair ; Eager said shortly , " You ai n't my customer , Mr. Eckman ; Lue is going to look after you . " " Well , where do I sit , " asked Eckman , " on his lap ? " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
