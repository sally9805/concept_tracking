Copper was more costly in the U.S. last week than at any time since Anaconda . Kennecott and Phelps Dodge started grand-scale copper mining in the west where the Flathead , Ute and Apache once roamed . The Big Three U.S. copper companies boosted prices to 46 a lb. , an increase of 30 since 1950 . On the London market , which has been successfully snagging copper coveted by U.S. industry , the price shot up to 52.5 a lb . <P> Worldwide copper strikes last year put a serious crimp in production . Meanwhile , annual world consumption has risen to more than 2 Ibs. per capita v. .6 in 1900 . The U.S. , where per capita consumption has soared from 5 to 17 Ibs. a year since 1900 , now uses more than half the free world 's copper production . For example , the electrical industry , which expects to double in size in the next decade , uses 115 Ibs. of copper to generate and distribute each new kilowatt of power . <P> The latest price boost was demanded by Chile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's supply . The Chilean government , which now channels no more than one-third of its copper output to the U.S. understandably opposes U.S. producers ' efforts to keep the price down because it gets a cut of company profits . Many U.S. industries also feel that the only way to get more of the metal is to lure Chilean copper back from Europe by matching Europe 's price . The copper shortage in the U.S. has spurred use of substitutes ; e.g. , radio manufacturers used 246% more aluminum in 1953 than 1947 v. 132% more copper . <P> Copper producers are racing to boost output , expect worldwide capacity to increase by 229,500 short tons in 1956 , or 8.3% , plus another 150,000 tons lost by strikes last year . By 1958 world copper capacity should be 15.7% above the 1955 level ( 2,928,000 tons ) . In Washington last week Government agencies were uniformly hopeful that the copper squeeze will end by midyear as a result of increased supply and slackening demand in some industries . However , few users put off orders in the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without strikes , many argued , long-term demand for consumer goods in the U.S. and underdeveloped countries abroad will continue to keep the pressure on price and supplies .
