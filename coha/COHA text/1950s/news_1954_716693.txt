txt ATOM POWER SEEN AS COMION IN 1976 Half of All Electric Plants Then Building Will Use It , G.E . Head Tells N.A.M . By A. H. BASnliN By 1976 atomic energy will be used to fuel half of all the electric generating plants then being built , it was predicted yesterday . This forecast was put before the National Association of Manufacturers by Ralph J. Cordiner , president of General Electric . His estimate of the speed with which nuclear power would : come into widespread use as a source of electric power was considerably more optimistic than most official calculations . Mr. Cordiner made his prediction as part of a plea to industrialists to shun " creeping conservatism " in their approach to business planning . The head of the country 's big-I gest electrical manufz.:turing company advised his fellow executives to make their plansi on a twenty-year basis , instead of limiting themselves to the ups and downs of the immediate sales market .

" Cordiner advised the industrialists that the best way to defeat the Soviet challenge was to develop " a philosophy , a program and a passion " that would bring , a richer life to all mankind . The General Electric head said the survival of freedom was likely to depend on the kind of planning business men did . This applied especially , he said , to whether they would have the imagination to convert atomic fission from " our major source of fear ? into one of our major sources of fuel energy in the next century . " " If private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of atomic power , " Mr. Cordiner observed , " it is our optimistic estimate that , by 1976 , 50 per cent of the new electric power facilities then being installed will be atomic . " He expressed confidence that the introduction of atomic fuel would not upset requirements for coal , gas and oil . He said the world would continue to use these traditional fuels in " ever-increasing quantities . " Mr .. Cordiner pointed to the development of automatic factories as another potential device for giving men increased freedom and raising living standards . He said the electrical manufacturing industry would have to double its output in the next ten years , even though the expected growth in the total labor force would be only 11 per cent . The answer lay in increased productivity at every , level of operations , Mr. Cordiner remarked . He said a process of evolution would have to precede attainment of a fully automatic fabtory , and he stressed the need for increasing the country 's supply of engineers , technicians and skilled workers to keep pace with the requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funds Mr. Cordiner called for a doubling or tripling of public expenditures on education and urged business to give incre : -. std attention to financial aid to private colleges and universities .
