1-5 SERIES OF DISSOLVES - DAY STOCK FADE IN Behind the MAIN TITLES we see exciting action shots of Grumman " Wildcat " fighters , flying formation against brilliant sky and cloud background , landing and taking off from carriers and diving on target butts . There are no war scenes , but rather a progression suggesting the final concentrated training of a Marine fighter squadron before entering a combat zone . The last shots show a small carrier pulling away from its pier at night , with empty decks , under war-time secrecy , followed by a day shot of Wildcats coming aboard the carrier under way . The following narration is SUPERIMPOSED and also HEARD . &nbsp; NARRATOR 'S VOICE " IN THE STORY OF THE MARINE WINGS WE CAN SUPPLY NO REASONABLE QUOTA OF VETERAN CHARACTERS .
