txt Hope for a quick end of the three-day seamen 's strike , which is slowly clamping a vise on one-half of the nation 's privately operated merchant fleet , faded late yesterday when the National Maritime Union , C. I. 0. , suddenly increased the monetary , formula it had demanded earlier of 100 tanker and dry-cargo ship operators . A tanker negotiating committee . which was prepared to concede a 2 to 6 per cent wage and overtime increase , met at the Commodore Hotel yesterday with a union group headed by Joseph Curran , N. M. U. president . The committee represents the owners of 239 deep-sea vessels . This formula had been pressed by the union at meetings with the operators on Tuesday and Wednesday . Both the dry-cargo passenger Ship operators and the tanker representatives had steadfastly refused the demand and offered a 3 per cent across-the-board increase . In an interview yesterday at union headquarters , 346 West Seventeenth Street , Mr. Curran said the union would insist on the 2 to 6 per cent formula or an agreement by the operators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union 's stand was backed up by the unanimous vote of its national council to strike formally for the demands . Offer Is Reconsidered Carl F. Vander Clute , Gulf Oil ' Company official , and spokesman for the tanker committee , said yesJerday that the oil companies had reconsidered the wage offer and asked the union group to a meeting at the Commodore Hotel . In a telephone conversation prior to the meeting , Mr. Vander Clute said he first had asked Mr. Curran to " shave the demand to 2 to 4 per cent , " but finally indicated that the companies would pay the higher formula . He added that Mr. ' Curran had raised the demand to 5 per cent during the conversa- , tion , but agreed that " we might do business at the lower figure . " Mr. Vander Clute said that Mr. Curran and his group then insisted on the 5 per cent rise at . the meeting and , when the operators objected , walked out of the session with his committee . " It was the most dastardly action I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asked to comment on Mr. Vander Clute 's statement , Mr. Curran permitted himself to be quoted by an associate to the following effect : " A man who identified himself as Vander Clute , who sounded like Vander Clute and convinced me he was Vander Clute made an offer of 5 per cent across the board . When the union officers called at the Commodore to discuss it I was astounded to find they had withdrawn the 5 per cent . I 'm not too surprised , as the tankermen 's tactics have been deceptive since the start . " The union spokesman added that the N. M. U. had insisted on the 5 per cent . across-the-board increase because the tanker companies would not eliminate inequities under which tanker seamen received less pay than com'parable ratings on dry-cargo ( ships . If the inequities had been I rectified , he said , the union would ' have considered the 6-4-2 per cent formula . The formula turned down by the union would have provided a 2 per cent increase in the base pay and overtime of unskilled seamen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as able-bodied seamen , 1 and 6 per cent to the higher Intlings now earning more than $341 a month . Able-bodied seamen now receive $302.32 a month and ordinary seamen earn $239.40 . The overtime rate is now $1.87 an hour for men receiving more than $298.49 and $1.48 an hour for those earning less . Acceptance of the tanker offer was expected to set a pattern for the dry-cargo and passenger ship operators and probably end the strike . Thirty-nine of the drycargo operators are represented by the Committee for the Companies and Agents , Atlantic and Gulf Coasts , which is beaded by Walter E. Maloney , president of the American Merchant Marine Institute . In addition to these concerns and fifteen oil tanker companies , there are forty independent steamship lines that usually follow the wage pattern set by Mr. Maloney 's com-1 mittee . Several of these independent companies broke away from the strong front Mr. Maloney 's committeehad maintained . These , ac- , cording to the union , were the Sword Line , a coastwise operator with four ships ; the Orion Ship- , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tankers are con cerned , and the Isbrandtsen Company . operator of a dozen ships . The union added that the Luckenbach Steamship Company had asked also for an agreement permitting its ships to operate and ' promising to grant whatever gains the union made . The wage demands were the only obstacle to the signing of a new contract , the union and operators said . A number of fringe issues had been set aside in favor of the more important pay items or had been tentatively agreed upon by concessions by one side or the other . The nature of the concessions was not disclosed . The strike , involving about 40.000 , seamen , has tied up about 100 of the 700 ships under contract with the N. M. U. The union said about forty of the ships , including the superliner United Slates , were idle in New York . Other passenger ships affected are the American Export Lines ' Excalibur. which was scheduled to sail at 4 P. M. today for the Mediterranean , and the Grace liners Santa Maria , Santa Clara and Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 12:01 A. M. Tuesday , but was extended a day at the request of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , which stepped into the dispute late Monday , when the strike became inevitable . The service is represented by Frank H. Brown , regional director , and Commissioners Harry Winning and Sidney Sheiner . A union spokesman said late last night that the national council 's vote to strike would have to be ratified by the rank and file in the various ports . He said the balloting would be conducted today and should be completed within twentyfour hours . He added that a formal strike , involving picketing , would not be invoked as long as there was a possibility of negotiations continuing . In the meantime , the union will maintain its " no contract , no work ' : procedure , which is effectively tying up shipping , while at the same time permitting the union members to remain on the company payrolls . Only in the event a crew is ordered off a vessel will picketing be introduced , he said .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
