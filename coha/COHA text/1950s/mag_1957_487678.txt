He came with his wife and two daughters and three suit -- cases and a paper bag and the promise from a brother in Harlem , New York City , that there was work to be found in " fabrica . " The work in the sugar cane was over for the season , and Ricardo had found nothing else . The government was prepared to pay him $7 every two weeks 1 for thirteen weeks before the season began again , and then with the season he would get $3.60 a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it before , as his fathers had done it , but this time he told himself he wanted something more .

Even more practically , Columbus ' weathered figure serves those who stay , for around it sit the old men who sit around the statues in the plazas of the world ; these , by the chance of Columbus ' mistaken , discoveries ( and ' Ponce de Leon 's mistaken hopes ) , speaking the language of his creditor , the Queen . But the Queen is four centuries dead and the island 's highest ruler is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language is totally foreign to the old men who sit by the statue . Their fathers before them were Indians here , called Borinquen ; and Spanish followers of Ponce de Leon , seeker after gold and youth and captor of neither . ' His body is buried up the street . Their fathers were Negro slaves from Africa , brought here to fill the vacuum left when the Indians painfully vanished , by death and escape , from the Spaniards ' rule . The Spaniards built great forts and repulsed the futile attacks of the French and the Dutch and Sir Francis Drake , and ruled until 1898 . It that Admiral Sampson bombarded San Juan and General Nelson Miles led his troops to the island soil with the news that he brought " the advantages and blessings of enlightened civilization from the United States of America " ? and the island again was a colony without self-rule . The old Spanish walls of the city were broken at last , and to the east of the plaza of Christopher Columbus , there ' stands today a building of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gates . The only gate remaining is used now not to keep enemies out but to draw tourists in . Across from the Alcaldia ? the city hall  --  constructed by the Spanish in 1604 , is The New York Department Store , proclaiming in Spanish a sale in which " Everything Goes . " Below the grillwork balconies of the Old Sad Juan Bar and Grill , a sign in the window reads " Real Italian Pizza . " A taxicab crawls through the narrow , stone streets like an insect caught in a maze , turning ' the high-walled corners with painstaking care . The city is quiet , and the old men who sit in the plaza seem unconcerned . Their fathers are gone and their sons are free to go . For more ' than a century , the sons have left the plazas and the dustand-green towns of the interior to come to New York . Ricardo San-. chez is young , but his journey is old . The first Puerto Ricans came to New York in the early 1800s , along with other men of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that " it is no good to be poor . " From Cuba and Santo Domingo they came , from San Juan and Haiti and Jamaica . Sorp e survived and others were lost , and in 1838 the men from Puerto Rico and Cuba who had managed to make themselves merchants of New York City organized a Spanish Benevolent Society for those of their brothers who had failed and were hungry . Others went West , and by 1910 there were Puerto Ricans living in thirty-nine states of the union . Twenty years later , the people of the island were in every state , though the great majority were still in New York City . The journey North from the Caribbean became a regular route for those seeking something better ( and having the money to make the search ) and for most of the first half of the twentieth century an average of 4,000 came from Puerto Rico to the mainland every year . NO ONE seemed to notice . It was not until after the Second World War that the quiet , steady migration became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more new jobs than ever before and d the word passing on from relative to relative , friend to friend , employment recruiter to unemployed . There were 39,900 who came the first year the war was over , and by 1957 there were nearly 600,000 Puerto Ricans in New York City  --  a million expected by 1970 ? and 175,000 scattered through the rest of the mainland United States . The journey had become not only more promising because of the mar -- ket for jobs after World War II , but easier because of the airplanes. that rose from San Juan airport and landed at Idlewild , New York , 1600 miles northwest up the ocean , in only eight hours . There were secondhand planes making unscheduled flights for $35 ? they could charge that price because they were paid off later by men from the States who came to Puerto Rico and charged " employment agent " fees that consumed life-savings sweated from sugar cane as payment for jobs in New York City that did n't exist . Some of the victims never knew , because they first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashed in the Atlantic . After that the government outlawed the small , unscheduled airlines from making the San Juan-New York run . Ricardo Sanchez , waiting in the dark for the bus marked " Aeropuerto , " held for himself ' and his family tickets on the Eastern Airlines $52.50 night-coach flight to New York . It leaves six nights a week from San Juan at 11 o'clock and arrives the next morning at Idlewild airport ' at seven . No official airlines terminology distinguishes it from the other night-coach flight that costs $64 , leaves a half-hour later and arrives two hours earlier . The cheaper flight is also the " night coach , " but it is not recommended  --  or even suggested at the ticket counters  --  to non-Puerto Rican travelers . English-speaking people who ask about it are told that it is better to spend the extra money and go on the 11:30 p.m. flight . There were only Puerto Ricans on the " Aeropuerto " bus that Ricardo Sanchez boarded in the plaza of Christopher Columbus . They stayed together when they reached the San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relatives and watchers in the crowd on the- , obserVation deck . When the flight was called , it was as if a troop plane were leaving for a war , or a group of refugees being shipped by necessity out of their native country . It is that way every night around 11 o'clock at the San Juan airport  --  the women crying and the men embracing them ; the old people staring out of wrinkled , unperceiving faces and the young engrossed with the wonder rather than the pain of it ; pressing up against the iron rail of the observation deck and squinting through the dark to watch the line of human travelers move as if drawn by a spell through the gate below and into the still silver plane that swallows them , closing silver on silver to complete itself , and then slowly moving away toward the dark . INSIDE THE airplane , Ricardo Sanchez had seated his wife and one of his daughters on the left-hand , two-seat aisle , and taken his other daughter and himself across to the right in the three-seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these flights are nearly always full . The $52.50 night flights run by both Eastern and Pan American from San Juan to New York are booked for days in - advance . The plane was hot  --  hotter than the 75-degree weather outside  --  and many of the men , already sweating , had taken off their coats . A young , dark-skinned woman in an aqua silk dress was crying softly and fanning herself with the plastic " Occupado " sign from the pocket in the seat in front of her . The stewardess appeared at the head of the aisle when the door was closed and gave a demonstration of how to put on a life-jacket in case of emergency , while the steward gave instructions , first in Spanish and then in English . The engines began , swelled , and the plane crept forward . The woman in the aqua dress pressed her face against the porthole-style window , crying much louder now . The balcony of watchers grew smaller and darker , became a few white handkerchiefs waved in the night , and then was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving above the red , white and green pinpoints strung geometrically and sparkling in the pattern of the city and suburbs of San Juan . In several minutes the dark had covered it . The no-smoking and safety-belt signs in the plane blinked off , the overhead lights went out , and only the small , individual reading lights above the seats were on . The babies stopped crying , and the temperature of the plane began to cool . Seats were pushed back , and soon the thin beams of light from the few remaining reading lights were thickened with cigarette smoke . The stewardess came by and asked Ricardo Sanchez if he wanted her to hang up his r  --  nitcoat . The stewardess did not speak Spanish and Ricardo , looking at her quizzically and smiling politely , clutched his coat when she reached for it and held it folded on his lap . He leaned his head back against the seat , folding , his hands on his lap , and stared straight ahead , the view slightly tilted with the angle of the seat ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he closed his eyes . The dull , steady roar of the engine was the single sound , growing louder and fuller as other sounds stopped , until , in its constant drone and throb , the sound became no sound at all , but a part of the plane 's suspended life . It became a sound again several hours later when the , , screams woke Ricardo Sanchez from his tilted sleep : , " Ay , Ay , AYYY ! " THE WOMEN screamed as the plane fell forward through the dark . The sound of the two engines heightened and throbbed . The plane leveled off from the drop , leaving the stomachs of the passengers with the sickening , overturned sensation that comes on a roller coaster during the sudden , steep descent . The steward hurried down the aisle with smelling salts . " Ricardo Sanchez leaned forward to look across the aisle at his wife . Her head was leaning across on her daughter , who sat in silence , her eyes Widening to watch the steward stop by the seat and wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white teeth were clenched together as if he were being struck . He started up , but the safety belt was fastened on his waist . He looked at it a moment , then leaned back into his ' seat . The ' , plane dipped again . The steward stopped and explained to the only ndn-Puerto Rican passenger that the plane had hit a storm . " We feel it quite a bit , " he said . " The planes for this flight are n't pressurized . If you take the 11:30 flight  --  the $64 one  --  you fly above all this : " There was no announcement in , Spanish about the storm . Ricardo , Sanchez ' wife , revived , pulled the December 7 , 1957 white bag fOr vomiting out of the pocket of the seat and leaned into it . Lightning flashed as the plane pitched again in the dark  --  the tiny green light on the end of the wing was the only thing visible . Ricardo Sanchez tightened the safety belt of his daughter who sat next to him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed against the back of it , her thin legs sticking out with the , shiny black patent leather shoes not touching the floor . Her father stroked her hair , , then leaned back himself and touched the palms of , his hands together , pointing upward , on his lap . Thiough the crack of the seat in front , the brown , large- , veined hands of a woman twisted and knotted and pulled on a rainbow-colored silk handkerchief . The dips became slighter and the screams lower , several becoming soft , continual moans that rose with the falls of the plane . A man walked back to the stewardess , who sat reading a copy of The Saturday Eveilin Post and asked her in English if the worst of the storm was over . She looked up annoyed and said , " I 'm not the pilot , " touched her forefinger to her tongue and flipped the page of the magazine A little after five o'clock in the morning the silver wings of the plane became visible , and then a layer of clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the layer of clouds in the East , and an orange streak grew from the pink . The bil lowed layers of clouds below became blue-gray , then lighter blue . Ricardo Sanchez tapped his daughter 's shoulder and told her to look . She leaned across on his lap and he explained " It is dawn . Look  --  it is beautiful . " sABOUT six o'clock ' the stewardess came by with a tray of steaming paper cups and asked each passenger , in English , " Would you like some coffee ? " Some did n't seem to understand so the stewardess repeated the question in more distinct tones : " Would you like some ' coffee ? " There were those who still did not understand and the stewardess , seemingly annoyed , passed on . Some people nodded , or held out their hands , and were given coffee . The woman in the aqua silk dress stood up in the aisle and pulled up her stockings . She sat back down , pulled a small bottle from her pulse , turned it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , sweet smell of perfume spread across the aisle . The plane had broken through the clouds and there was water below . Soon there was land  --  another island ; this one , too , striped and set with rows of white lights and green lights ? fewer lights in the growing gray dawn than were seen in the night above San Juan . The island that the plane approached seemed not so much ' larger than the island it had left . Lower , the land turned brown and barren , with a swamplike series of protrusions in the water , and the plane moved closer till the brown , high grass on the land and the wind-ruffled waves on the water were clearly visible . The plane seemed about to ' touch the water and suddenly touched on land  --  the end of the Idlewild airstrip . The babies again were crying . The plane stopped , and the passengers looked out the window at the quiet runways , the long , low buildings , and the high , ' silver lampposts that arched in a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watchful animal , repeated row on row . The women stepped out of the silver door , clutching at their flimsy , bright-colored dresses , into the morning chill of New York and the gray , surrealistic landscape . of I dlewd d. 433
