txt Gen. J. Lawton Collins , outgoing Army Chief of Staff , testified to a Senate Appropriations subcommittee today that the manpower cuts in the ground forces envisaged by the revised defense budget President Eisenhower had presented to Congress carried " certain military risks and limitations " that he declined to specify in public . He said that the " combat readiness of the units in the United States is not expected to reach a satisfactory state " until late in the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1954 , and that , to accomplish the reduction in personnel , " the Army will have to adjust the strengths of its commands overseas , as well as the strength of units in the United States . " While General Collins was on the stand , the Senate confirmed the nomination of his successor , Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway , now commander of the forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , along with those of Admiral Arthur W. Radford to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Robert B. Carney to be Chief of Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Staff of the lAir Force . Calls for 117,000 Cut General Collins was preceded by Robert T. Stevens , Secretary of the Army , who told th subcommittee , headed by Senator Homer Ferguson , Republican of Michigan , that the proposed cut of about $1,000 , - 000,000 below the estimates presented by President Truman before leaving office would not affect adversely the current combat effectiveness of the Army . He said the revised budget would call for a reduction of 117,000 men in the Army 's strength below the Truman-projected level , the new level to be reached by June 30 , 1954 . If the Korean war should end before that time , he added , 50,000 more men would be released . He explained that President Truman 's request of $12,100,000 , - 000 had been trimmed , on review by himself at the direction of Charles E. Wilson , Secretary of Defense , to about $11,100,000,000 .

Previous budgets , submitted under President Truman , contained no requests for Korea , Mr. Stevens said . The Defense Department came to Congress for supplementary or deficiency appropriations to finance the war in Korea . " Are you announcing the stalemate will continue ? " , demanded Senator Ferguson . " No sir , that 's far from my idea , " Mr. Stevens replied . Mr. Stevens estimated that the Korean fighting , in the three years it has been in progress , had cost the Army about $15,000.000,000 . The Army ' Secretary reported that ammunition levels in Korea , about which complaint was registeredlast March by Gen. James A. Van Fleet , commander for almost two years of the United Nations ground forces there , " fully meet our current requirements . " He added that in Europe stocks were being expanded and larger quantities were being shipped there . Atomic Cannon Praised " Needless to . say , " Mr. Stevens concluded , " this budget will not provide an Army equipped to protect this country against all the momentous perils which face it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , does provide for a reasonable degree of protection to this country , consistent with the essential preservation of our economic solvency . " General Collins , appearing for what he expected to be the last time before an Appropriations group , took the occasion to point out some of the Army 's recent achievements . He was enthusiastic about the 280 mm. cannon capable of firing an atomic shell . Apparently to meet published criticisms of its mobility , General Collins said that the cannon could cross any bridge that would support a medium tank and that it could be broken down into four basic loads for transport by airplane . " It will greatly enhance the capabilities ' of our forces to meet the large Masses of troops that ' might possible be used against us in the event of another world war , " General Collins said . The Chief of Staff praised the tanks the Army was using , based on their performance against Soviet models in Korea . " Our Shermansta Pershings and the Pattons have knocked them the Russian standard medium tank , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 and 18 to 1 , respectively , " he said . " The tank action in Korea has not only proved the superiority of our armor but has also proven that our guns and fire control equipment are better , and that our tankers are much finer trained . " Industry Gets Assurance Meanwhile Defense  --  officials met with seventeen aircraft industry leac*ets to discuss the Administration 's plane procurement program . An industry official said later that the group now believed that the budget cuts , would no ; affect aircraft procurement as drastically as the manufacturers had earlier believed . The group was called to a luncheon meeting by Mr. Wilson and Harold E. Talbott , Secretary of the Air Force , on the eve of the Air Force 's presentation to Congress of the details of the reduced Air Force budget . The Administration reduced the Air Force 's requests for new spending authority for the fiscal year starting July 1 from $16,778,000 , - 000 to $11,688,000,000 and ordered its expenditures in the twelvemonth period reduced from $17 , - 500,000,000 , to $15,100,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased under this plan because of the amount of previously appropriated funds " still on the books . " An aircraft official said that the defense officials asserted that no program for deliveries of combat aircraft now in production was to be materially affected in the corn in year and that no major types of aircraft , even those barely in production , were to be eliminated from the planning program . Mr. Wilson and Mr. Talbott were said to have told the aviation leaders that the Pentagon 's drive was for improved production .
