The trouble with moviemaking today , said Cecil Blount ( The Greatest Show on Earth ) DeMille , is taxes . Taking taxes into consideration , he decided he could save money by closing down Cecil B. DeMille Productions . But , lest moviegoers think they might never again see a new DeMille epic , the producer-director added that he had no intention of actually retiring from picture making . <P> Last week DeMille announced his next subject-a story by another , older epic-maker . Said he : " I have always been fascinated by the story of Helen of Troy . It offers the first dramatic example of conflict between Asia and Europe . And the love story of Paris of Troy and the beautiful Spartan girl Helen is something I 've long wanted to bring to the screen . Homer did all right with his story . I 'd like to try it , too . "
