<P> If there is one thing a white settler in British Africa despises more than an " insolent " black , it is a troublesome member of the British Labor Party . When red-haired Barbara Castle , a member of the British House of Commons , had the presumption to dine with a black M.P . in Salisbury 's topflight Meikle 's Hotel , Southern Rhodesians were scandalized at her bringing along a " munt " ( from a Bantu word for man , used by Rhodesians as a rough equivalent of the U.S. 's " nigger " ) . Last week Southern Rhodesia was hard at it again with Labor , this time over a tall , aggressive , 33-year-old M.P . from England named John Thomson Stonehouse . <P> The son of a trade unionist and the Socialist lady sheriff of Southampton , Stonehouse sat at the feet of Harold Laski at the London School of Economics , is a great man for causes . No sooner had he landed in Salisbury on a five-week tour of Africa than the whites were up in arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gave a speech to 1,500 blacks . All things considered , it was moderate enough : the British Labor Party , he said , ' was absolutely against an independent federation that would be run for and by the whites , but " I am speaking for the whole Labor movement when I tell you to be patient . I ask you particularly not to use violence . I ask you to have pride in your country . Hold your heads high and behave as though this country belonged to you . Do not do anything of which you might be ashamed . " <P> Every daily and Sunday newspaper in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland is in the hands of a monopoly-the Argus South African Newspapers Ltd. - which has no love for visiting Labor politicians . Headlined the Sunday Mail : M.P . TELLS AFRICANS " WE ARE WITH YOU ! " There followed the kind of story which stirs up indignant letters from settlers . To make matters worse , Stonehouse invited three Africans to dine with him in the very dining room that Barbara Castle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer got Stonehouse out of bed to warn him that he could be declared a " prohibited immigrant . " Next morning , after a " token struggle , " Stonehouse found himself on a plane bound for Tanganyika . <P> In London , angry Laborites tried to censure the Macmillan government for allowing a British protectorate to manhandle one of their own . Never before had such a thing happened to a British M.P . After a white-lipped debate , Labor lost , 237 to 293 , partly because the Speaker ruled that an M.P . does not carry parliamentary privilege about with him , as a Foreign Office man does his diplomatic immunity . But if Stonehouse himself was not particularly popular on either side of the House , the temper of the mother of parliaments showed during the debate that it was very worried about the direction one of its children , the Central Africa Federation , is taking .
