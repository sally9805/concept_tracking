Digging Down Under <P> Sir : <P> Thank you for your commendable tongue-twisting , throat-throttling , teeth-twitching review Feb. 25 of Smiley . <P> <P> MELVILLE MORRIS JR . Boston <P> Sir : <P> I do n't wish to appear to be overly inquisitive , but I would like to put a question to the reviewer of Smiley : Did he or did he not like the movie ? <P> <P> A. ROBERT KASSIN Brooklyn <P> He said it was bokker. - ED . Sir : <P> <P> Because TIME did n't print a glossary , Are brickbats flying in , I wonder ? Your " Smiley " leaves me at a lossary-I just do n't dig so deep Down Under . <P> <P> BUELL R. SNYDER <P> Beachwood , N.J. <P> <P> A bludger is a sleazy hood , Flat stoney is broke as can be . Bokker means it 's bloody good , And a basket of oranges is she. - ED . <P> <P> Southern Battleground <P> Sir : <P> Re your Feb. 18 cover story on Montgomery 's Martin Luther King : Your lack of taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MRS . ) WILLEY-GAYLE MARTIN Montgomery , Ala . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Kudos for your article , and a pox on the bigoted segregationists of Montgomery , Ala . Thank you for opening my eyes . <P> <P> TONY VEHE Gstaad , Switzerland <P> Sir : <P> Why must humanity spawn so many little Talmadges-and so few great Kings ? <P> <P> ROBERT G. STOLZE Belleville , Ill . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I have tolerated your slanted treatment of the South and Southerners because I enjoyed reading other sections of TIME ; but your picture of the " Montgomery Battleground " is too much to take . My friends do not wear " wool hats " or carry sticks of dynamite , nor have they ever condoned any violence against the colored people or ever attended any mass meetings to organize against Negroes or belong to the Ku Klux Klan . That there are Christians among the ignorant whites may be almost unbelievable to your intelligent readers in the North . My friends do have one thing in common : they have or are becoming nonsubscribers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GARY LaGrange , Ga . <P> <P> Sir : <P> TIME continues its insults to the South with its cover portrait of a Negro preacher , who spends his time agitating equality of the races . <P> <P> We only read TIME to see what new slur it has for the white people of the South , whether it is race trouble in Georgia or Mississippi , or a goose pulling in South Carolina . <P> <P> W. B. BURCH Winter Garden , Fla . <P> TIME brings all things . The cruel and ancient " sport " of goose pulling ( see cut ) no longer exists in South Carolina . <P> <P> - ED . <P> <P> Sir : <P> What happened to copies of the Feb. 18 issue in the South ? <P> <P> R. D. FENTRISS Valparaiso , Ind . <P> A sellout. - ED . <P> <P> Feathered Pedestrian <P> Sir : <P> I hold no brief for the 1957 car models described in your Feb. 18 Letters column , but on behalf of my fellow citizens of this state , I resent Mrs. McKinley 's remarks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a curious delight to the traveler , an unassuming and , indeed , pedestrian fellow-the antithesis of the long , loud , brassy products designed for conspicuous consumption by the free-wheeling denizens of the freeways . <P>
