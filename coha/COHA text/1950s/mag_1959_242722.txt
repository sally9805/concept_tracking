Comfortably cool in his air-conditioned office , President James M. Skinner Jr. , of Philadelphia 's Philco Corp. , leafed through his weather reports last week and broke out a sunny smile . " It hit 90 in Indianapolis , 91 in Chicago , 92 in Cleveland , 93 in Knoxville , and even higher in the Deep South , " he exulted . " If only this nice hot , humid weather continues , we 'll really sell air conditioners this year . " <P> Sales of room air conditioners generally follow the thermometer . The past two summers were cool , and the industry 's sales were slow , sliding along at roughly the 1956 level of $3.2 billion . This season is shaping up as the hottest in the industry 's 57-year history . Carrier Corp. , the industry 's Goliath ( total 1958 sales : $252.5 million ) , is selling room units 32% ahead of last year , and Fedders Corp. , biggest seller of room units ( fiscal 1958 : $53.9 million ) , is running 10% ahead in shipments . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Eisenhower 's Gettysburg farmhouse to King Saud 's Saudi Arabian harem , topped last year 's shipment rate by 47% . Borg-Warner 's York Division , which normally shuts its window-unit assembly lines by June 30. , scheduled production well into July . <P> Makers predict that production of room units will rise from last year 's 1,350,000 to about 1,700,000 , and shipments of central air conditioners will go from last year 's 224,000 to 280,000 . They expect a boost from the record number of new houses going up this year ( see Construction ) ; 10% of them will be built with central air conditioning v. only 1.4% in 1952 . Says the Federal Housing Administration : " Within a few years , any house that is not air-conditioned will probably be obsolescent . " <P> Paying Its Way . The boom is fathered by increased U.S. spending , but it is mothered by smart marketing . The industry has steadily brought down prices ( current range : $225 to $375 per ton for central units in new houses ) while putting out more compact , smoother-operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models of Admiral , Carrier and others are 50% to 60% smaller than in 1956 . General Electric claims that one of its 1959 bedroom models is virtually noiseless . Westinghouse , Fedders , Emerson are putting out install-it-your-self " portable " models . York is packaging parts needed for installation with the cooler to reduce high and widely fluctuating costs of putting it in . As optional equipment . Philco is offering an " Ionitron " ( price : $50 ) to charge the air with negative ions , which , says Philco after a five-year hospital study , snuff out the sneezes of victims of hay fever . <P> This year 's giants in the field are stronger than ever because they have weathered a vigorous shakeout . A few years ago there were 100 manufacturers . Scores dropped out , including Servel , Vornado , International Harvester . Each victim left behind a heavy inventory , which went at fire-sale prices . Now inventories are down to the bone , and the price wars are past .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
