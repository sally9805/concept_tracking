" What we say and do here will be heard in all the states of the Union , " cried white-haired Defense Attorney William J. Corrigan . Day after day , some 50 reporters crowded into a stuffy Cleveland courtroom to cover the case of Dr. Samuel Sheppard , on trial for the murder of his pretty , pregnant wife , Marilyn . Last week , after 30-odd long and often tedious trial days , the prosecution closed with a dramatic scene , the testimony of Sam 's former mistress , Susan Hayes . <P> " Why Kill Her ? " Slim , graceful Susan Hayes dressed carefully for her appearance . She wore a black wool dress with a prim white collar ; she used very little makeup . She was the 31st witness against Sam Sheppard . and her testimony was supposed to supply the motive . <P> The attorneys , often strident and harsh , were gentle with Susan , but their questions were in plain English . She told of her affair with Dr. Sam , beginning in 1952 , when she worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was a lab technician , and he was a doctor , " she said , as though explaining everything . Their relations continued at fleeting moments until last March , when he took her to the home of a friend in California for a week . Did they share the same bed ? the prosecutor asked . She said faintly : " Yes . " <P> <P> He had spoken of divorce , she said , but had never made her any promises . " I remember him saying he loved his wife very much . " she testified , " although not so much as a wife . " After 76 minutes , she left the stand . For the defense , one of Sheppard 's attorneys argued that Susan 's testimony suggested no motive for the murder of Mrs. Sheppard : " He certainly did n't have to kill her to get Susan Hayes . He had her whenever he wanted . " <P> " My God-Marilyn 's Dead . " Sam 's brother , Dr. Stephen Sheppard , was the first defense witness . He related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before the murder , Sam and Marilyn Sheppard had talked about the baby they expected . As he spoke , Sam Sheppard , usually grave and composed , bowed his head and sobbed . <P> When told of the murder , Dr. Stephen said , he rushed to his brother 's house and found him lying on the study floor : " I thought he was dead . I noted that he was bare from the waist up . That 's all I recall . I touched him on the shoulders . He moved . " Upstairs , he said , he found Marilyn dead on the bed . " She was mercilessly and terribly beaten about the head . She was unrecognizable , except in profile . " When taken away to the family hospital . Sam Sheppard " was mumbling incoherently to himself . " Once he said : " My God-Marilyn 's dead ! " Later , he blamed the murder on a burly , bush-haired intruder with whom he had struggled futilely . <P> Assistant County Prosecutor John J. Mahon , who has sent more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has tried to make his case with technical detail : drops of blood , grains of sand , eight strands of hair and other minutiae which demonstrated that Sam Sheppard could have committed the murder . The defense will call more than a score of witnesses in an effort to indicate that he did not .
