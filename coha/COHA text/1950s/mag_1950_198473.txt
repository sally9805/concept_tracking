In Adolf Hitler 's Germany , Sculptor Josef Thorak had a big job : official sculptor of the Third Reich . His huge statuary was to decorate the squares and public buildings of the city that Hitler was to make the " thousand-year capital " of the Reich . To house Thorak 's enormous work in preparation , some of it six stories high and weighing 1,000 tons , the Fhrer built him a studio as high and wide as a Zeppelin hangar . When the job proved to be insecure , Sculptor Thorak retired to semiobscurity in Bavaria . <P> Last week , 61 , and finally cleared by a Bavarian denazification court , Thorak was allowed to make a modest comeback with a postwar show in Salzburg . His most ambitious works , along with the regime they celebrated , had long since been destroyed , e.g. , his huge ( 60 by 36 ft. ) marble statue of German road builders , the product of four years ' work , had been cut into building blocks . Nonetheless , Thorak had managed to get together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limply classical war memorial , to remind Salzburg of just how grandiose he could be . <P> Towering twice as big as life were melodramatic figures of Copernicus , Paracelsus , the 16th Century alchemist-physician , and Fischer von Erlach , the Austrian baroque architect . One full-blown nude stood nearly seven yards tall in her bare feet . But with his biggest booster gone , Thorak found his reputation had already shrunk to less than life size . The public sniffed at his glibly traditional sculpture , complained that his 12-foot Paracelsus ( 1940 ) , intended for the local railway plaza , was not worthy of Salzburg . <P> The experts were no kinder . One critic suggested that Thorak 's jumbo-sized statues would have been more appropriate as small porcelain figurines to " decorate a small table . " Said another : " It shows how low our taste has become , that this ' art ' of the dictatorship still finds acknowledgment today . " <P> Sitting among his stone giants last week , Josef Thorak was asked what he thought of his old patron 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Thorak finally , " and if what I do is art , he understood art .
