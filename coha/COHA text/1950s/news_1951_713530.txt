txt Goodness sometimes breaks out on people without explanation , Corp . Horrise D. Crownover , 23 , learned today . The soldier , who is from Bonham , ' Tex. , has been married 11 months and is attached to the 1st army 's military police , was walking along 9th ay . when it happened . " How are you , soldier ? " said a silk hatted stranger , a slender , mustached man about as he extended his hand . The corporal shook hands with his smiling well wisher , who then melted into the crowd and disappeared . It took Crownover a moment to realize something had been left in his hand . It was a $100 bill . Surely , he thought , there 's a gimmick somewhere , it 's a phony or a trick . He showed it to his M. P. associates , to the police and to a bank teller . All assured him it was genuine . Whoever wanted to make hirer feel , good had done it with colossal success .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
