The letter was a somewhat indiscreet one for a young matron to write a middle-aged widower-especially when the widower was the eminent Thomas Jefferson , U.S. minister to the court of Louis XVI . Nonetheless , Maria Cosway , 29 , wanted a portrait of Jefferson , and she was direct enough to write and ask for one . " It is , " she added , " a person who hates you that requests this favor . " <P> As scholars have long known , Maria Cosway was merely being coy : far from hating Jefferson , she was a great &; good friend of the U.S. minister , and eventually her request was granted . Whatever happened to the painting afterward ? Until this week , it was one of the minor puzzles in the story of gallant Mr. Jefferson 's famous Paris romance . <P> " Urgent Dispatches . " The romance began one August day in 1786 when Painter John Trumbull introduced Jefferson to the British miniaturist Richard Cosway and his young and flirtatious wife . Jefferson was apparently struck by Maria at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day . He even sent a messenger to the Duchesse de la Rochefoucauld d'Anville . He was sorry , he said , but he could not make it for dinner . " Urgent dispatches " were keeping him at his desk . <P> After that , Jefferson saw Maria almost every day . They shopped together for pictures , saw the Bibliotheque du Roi , visited the galleries . They saw everything , Jefferson happily recorded , from the gardens and statues of Paris to the " rainbows " of the Versailles waterworks and the hills along the Seine . <P> Then , on Sept. 18 , Jefferson broke his wrist . Some scholars think that he may have been feeling frisky , and that while strolling with Maria , he took a playful leap that was too much for his 43 years . In any case , the daily expeditions ceased . By the time Jefferson was well again , Maria had gone back to London . <P> " Wish Me Joy . " From then on , they saw each other less often . But their cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed the Channel scores of times . In one of them , Maria finally asked for a picture-a miniature " coppy " that Trumbull was to make of a portrait he had don6 in Paris . At the time , Maria was miffed at Jefferson for not having answered her last letter . " She is angry , " Trumbull jokingly told Jefferson , " yet she teases me every day for a copy of your little portrait-that she may scold it , no doubt . " <P> Maria got her portrait ( " Wish me joy , " she wrote , " for I possess your Picture " ) , and it was about all she had to remember Jefferson by . He went back to the U.S. , and she founded a school for girls in Lodi , Italy . <P> This week , in the William and Mary Quarterly , a lady-historian named Elizabeth Cometti reported that she had solved the mystery of the missing portrait . She had gone looking for it in the most obvious place she could think of , and sure enough , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 100 years , in the little school in Lodi , where Maria lies buried . There , among her treasures , it will remain .
