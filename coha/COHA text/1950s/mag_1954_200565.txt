One afternoon last week stocky , stolid Premier Joseph Laniel walked to the rostrum in the National Assembly , ran a stubby finger around his collar to loosen it , and began , in a flat , unemphatic voice , to read a speech . For the second time in eight days , to bolster France 's search for peace at Geneva , Joseph Laniel was staking his Cabinet 's continuation in office on a vote of confidence . He had survived the first vote ( before the fall of Dienbienphu ) by a comfortable margin , 311 to 262 . This time he realized that his government might fall . <P> Laniel first took up Dienbienphu : " The defeat must be explained by a sudden change in Viet Minh war methods , brought about with Chinese aid . . . The battle of Dienbienphu marks a turning point in the evolution of Viet Minh military strength . Our garrison had been caught by surprise . " Snapped a Socialist Deputy : " We are still surprised ! " <P> To Carry On . Laniel continued : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chief with the means to carry on . " It would send to Indo-China several more battalions of troops , crews and mechanics for 25 bombers , and two flotillas of naval craft , plus artillery , tanks and machine guns-but still no conscripts . Then he came to the crux of his plea for support : " I refuse to believe that at the present hour this Assembly intends to provoke a rupture of the negotiations . . . What other policy than ours do you propose ? Some people seem to rely more upon our enemies than our friends , and it has become fashionable in certain quarters to complain more about the U.S. , which is helping us , than about the Viet Minh , who are killing our soldiers . " This remark drew a heated , mendacious retort from the Communist benches : " We are as good patriots as you are ! " <P> Joseph Laniel survived the balloting by the narrowest margin-two votes-of his 10-month tenure as Premier . The count showed 289 votes for , 287 against , with 33 abstentions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and many a man in the street concluded that the Deputies , acting in psychic accord , had engineered the two-vote margin as a stinging reproof to Laniel . Bringing down Laniel could have caused new elections , and the Deputies ' own seats would have been in jeopardy . Three Gaullists who had intended to abstain changed their minds and voted for Laniel . <P> Said the right-wing pro-Gaullist L'Aurore : " This confidence vote had nothing to do with ' confidence . ' " Said the right-wing independent Le Figaro : " The parties did not want to choke Laniel to death , they merely wanted to make it difficult for him to continue breathing . " The left-wing Socialist Franc-Tireur : " By scientifically doctoring its votes , the Chamber has . . . condemned itself even more severely than it condemned the government . "
