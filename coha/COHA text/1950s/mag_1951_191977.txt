Willem de Kooning is the sort of painter who gives most people a pain : superficially his pictures look like scribbles any kid could do . They are not really like that at all ; the difference between De Kooning 's work and mere doodling is enough to make him one of America 's liveliest advance-guard artists . Despite his reputation and the fact he is all of 47 , De Kooning has had only two one-man shows ; the second opened in a Manhattan gallery last week . " I have n't felt ready for exhibitions , " he explains , " and I 'm not particularly happy about this one . I 'm still working out of doubt . " <P> Doubtful or not , De Kooning wallops into each canvas with a will , drawing lines that resemble streams of ticker tape on the wind , whipped free one instant , snarled the next , and punctuated with blobs and smears which break the canvas into arcs , tunnels , humps and skies of space . Weak in color , his paintings are always original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush drawings , they have an air of being dashed off , and they are . To give his work the spontaneous quality , De Kooning does it fast , destroys hundreds of failures . <P> Raised in Rotterdam , De Kooning left school at twelve , worked as sign painter and house painter while studying at Rotterdam 's art academy at night : " I met a lot of fellows and we became a little like bohemians . We tried to paint like the impressionists . Some of us imitated Mondrian , too , but we did n't really get it very good . " At 21 , De Kooning came to the U.S. , knowing only one word of English : " Yes . " He got a job as a commercial artist , visited the art galleries in his lunch hours and painted by himself on Sundays : " I was influenced by lots of artists . If you paint your whole life , you take that for granted , and after a while all kinds of painting become just painting for you-abstract or otherwise . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kooning from commercial work , made him resolve to paint fulltime . " People have helped me , and I more or less made out . You do n't really go hungry - that 's the funny thing . " Married to an art critic , he now teaches at the Yale School of the Fine Arts a day and a half a week , paints in his Manhattan studio the other days . He is quite unimpressed by the fame his paintings have begun to gain . " Nothing is positive about art , " he says , " except that it is a word . "
