At a luncheon in Pasadena last week , Mrs. Mildred Younger , 33 , a comely GOPolitician , faced State Senator Jack B. Tenney , 56 , whose political record is far from comely . Tenney represents the big 38th District ( which takes in Los Angeles County , with more than 4,000,000 people ) . He was chairman of the legislature 's McCarthyite Red-hunting committee and once wrote a Christian Nationalist tract , Zionist Network . Mrs. Younger has decided to run against him . <P> According to luncheon protocol no candidate could mention another , but Millie Younger , whose brains and looks delighted the 1952 Republican Convention ( TIME , July 21 , 1952 ) , felt she had to challenge Tenney 's bland assertion that " I have never been connected in any way with Gerald L. K. Smith . " As the lunch ended , she went up to Tenney , snapped : " I 'm disgusted with you . " Replied Tenney : " Likewise . " <P> Younger : Do you mean to say you have no connection with Gerald L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Younger : Was n't your picture on the cover of The Cross &; the Flag last month ? <P> Tenney : Yes . Wonderful , was n't it ? <P> Younger : Is n't that Gerald L. K. Smith 's publication ? <P> Tenney : I believe so . <P> Younger : But you still have no connection with him ? <P> Tenney : That 's right . <P> Younger : Were n't you a candidate for the vice presidency of the U.S. on the Christian Nationalist Party ticket ? <P> Tenney : I ran with Douglas MacArthur. * <P> Younger : But was n't it the C.N.P. ? <P> Tenney : I do n't know ; I think so . <P> Younger : You do n't know ! Well , Gerald L. K. Smith is executive secretary of that party , just in case you did n't know . <P> Tenney : Well , Gerald L. K. Smith is a fine American . When this is all over , it will have been a lot of fun . Exit Tenney . <P> When it 's all over , Tenney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California observers expect the race to be close , believe that Mrs. Younger has at this moment a lead .
