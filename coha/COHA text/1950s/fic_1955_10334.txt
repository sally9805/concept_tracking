a blooded Arab stallion , his wooden leg screwed into the iron of his stirrup . Some jounced in dogcarts , others bumped on bicycles . It seemed to Elisabeth , looking out from her room at the blackening plains , that the yard resembled a wildebeest migration on the Serengeti . It was equally dusty and twice as noisy . " We 'll have the wedding in the morning , about eleven , Papa , " Elisabethhad said . " That 'll be when they 're still hung over from last night and before they 've had a real chance to get at the grog . We 'll have the meal at one , and after that Jeff and I will just nip off to the Outspan and let the carnage continue . Please lock up anything that 's breakable inside the house , and try to keep the guests from trampling all the flowers .

I have never really understood why they always have to fight each other just because they are such dear friends . The last wedding I remember from before the war , when Pam and Andrew Newby got hitched , they beat up the bridegroom and nearly tore the wedding dress off the bride . The bridegroom , the best man , and the bridegroom 's father were all in hospital for a week . Poor bloody bride went back home with her mum and patted her foot until they 'd patched up the husband sufficiently to start him on his honeymoon . Even then Pam had to help him in and out of the marriage bed with his crutch . " " Do n't be coarse , " said Elisabeth , laying out the newest batch of wedding presents , which had been drifting in for weeks . There were very few presents that could be contained in the house . Outside , in the paddock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a gift from Sir James Fitzroyce , who bred horses successfully since he had been sent out to the colonies as a result of generaldebt and disgrace . A fine Frisian stud bull , gift of Lord Waterholme , snorted in his stall . A rich Argentine stock saddle , silver-mounted and hand-carven , squatted on the veranda , and a leather case of matched Purdey shotguns rested on its end against the veranda wall . A herd of sheep , fat-wooled Merinos imported from Australia , was a gift from Count Olaf Holmberg . There was a blue-ribbon PolandChinaboar and a brood sow from Mark Malone , who lived close byp10Thomson 's Falls . There was an English two-handed crosscut saw , and a cask of Spanish sherry , and two pairs of Texas riding boots sent by somebody 's cousin in Dallas in Texas in America . Carr Hartley , who had the game farm , had sent over a semi-tame female hunting cheetah , who paced restlessly at the end of her tether under the big thorn tree , which tilted its umbrella of cool shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elisabeth thought as she surveyed the loot . What I really want is something bridy , like a portable sawmill or a tame bull buffalo . I 'm surprised nobody thought of it . Some of the things are nice , though . Some of the things were nice , such as the six perfectly matched leopard skins , sent by one of Jeff 's professional hunting pals , and representinga young fortune and the cream of possibly five hundred pelts , since each inky rosette and the dark gold coloration of each hide was identical . Such as a really smashing evening cape made of **28;8931;TOOLONG fur . Such as two hundred-pound elephant tusks , hand-polished to creamy white and mounted in oiled teak . Such as a complete carving set of Sheffield and another of Danish steel , the one inset into ebony handles , the other into ivory . Such as a dozen pewter Pimm 's mugs mounted on brilliantly polished ivory of wart-hog tusks , and an elaborate ebony serving table from the Congo . There were two Irish setter puppies , a boar hound , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linens and lace that had belonged to her mother , because when Lisa was finally out of the house Henry McKenziewished to be quit of the more painful mementos of Caroline McKenzie . " A fair haul , old lady , " Jeff said the day before the wedding . " A fair haul . But I fail to see any encouraging signs of bassinets or christening mugs . " " They 're supposed to come after a decent interval , you hairy nugu , " Elisabeth replied . " Go and play with the other children . The bride 's busy . " " By God , " Jeff said , scuttling away , " I hope you wo n't be too tired out tomorrow night for the main business . . . . " Then he ducked as she hurled a coil of heavy copper wire , gift of one of the nearby Masai herdsmen , at the back of his neck . The surrounding natives , Kikuyu and Masai , had also brought many gifts . There were easily a dozen beautifully wrought , bleached and decorated shields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There werep102heaps of the blue , red , and white beads , coils of copper wire , for the bride 's adornment . There were literally faggots of ostrich plume . There were several lion-mane headdresses  --  illegally killed , of course  --  and a cloak of white marabou feathers that brought a gasp from Elisabeth and even fetched a whistle from Jeff . There were several live goats , and clumps of chickens tied together by their legs . There were oddly constructed drinking gourds , and calabashes for beer , and delicately wrought iron bracelets and bangles . There was even one naked girl of eleven or twelve years , a fancifully painted little thing who dug her toe into the grass and sucked dedicatedly on her finger . " What'n the name of God 's this ? " Jeff asked . " Not one of mine , I hope , although she might well be , as she 's very light under the grease . " " I should hope not , " said Elisabeth . " We 'll have to return this present . One of Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Jolly good idea , a slave , " Jeff replied . " I can call it the nucleus of what I hope will be a large and multicolored harem . Come here , little girl , and let your new master inspect your teeth . " " A proper beast , you are . Take her down to the shambas and give her over to Wangu to look after until we can ship her back to her family . We 'll leave the concubine business to that peculiar Englishman you know in Uganda , the one with all the muddy-colored children . " " Shame , " Jeff said . " Here I am , about to yield up my virtue without ever having tried out the local product . Damned close to it once , though . It was donkey 's years ago , up in the Masai , when we saw this bibi taking a bath . Very pretty , too , she was , and as naked as dammit . Been out such a long time that I thought of boiling her for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the topsoil , but she read my mind , evidently , and buggered off . This marrying a white girl seems an anticlimax after those possibilities , does n't it ? " " You are a beast , darling . If I see you make one move toward me I shall scream the house down . " " Do you object to bathing that much ? " Jeff asked politely . " I do n't really insist on a clean bride . Give us a kiss and I 'm off . " It seemed to Jeff that he had never smelled anything quite like Elisabeth . He had known such a lot of women in England , the odd Waaf or Wren and a viscountess or so , but none he ever remembered seemed to smell simultaneously of soap , violets , May haw , moonbeams , and clean , sunburned , healthy girl , like any lovely girl smells on the silver beaches of Mombasa after a dip in the clear green salt water while you sit closep103on the beach to towel off and smoke a cigarette and sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped kissing her long enough to say : " You 'll bloody well smell right in Mombasa or the marriage is off , " and fell to kissing her again . He could feel her body quiver and press against him , and the slight change , the change of smell , the change of taste on her mouth , which first was fresh and sweet as a cow 's breath in a clover field , suddenly growing hot and slightly , ever so pleasantly , acridly musky with want . She pushed him away . " No hanky-panky out of you , my good fellow , " she said , breathing heavily . " Wait 'll tomorrow , when you 've got me penned up , " and grinned a delightfully salacious grin , accompanied by a lewd wink . " This is the goddamnedest woman I ever encountered , " Jeff muttered , herding the little **27;8961;TOOLONG back to Wangu 's hut in the native compound . " Good thing I 've been out in the bush for the last couple of weeks . Somehow I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considering she practically raped me that night in the Outspan and I wound up engaged before you could say knife . " Peter had been pleased enormously when Jeff asked him to be his best man . He knew , of course , that one of Jeff 's contemporaries , like Alan or Terry or Peter Voorhees would normally have been asked , but they were all off to Abyssinia or Libya or Burma or someplace , and it tickled him that he had been chosen over the few remaining fellows who had gone to school with Jeff . It pleased him , too , that he and Jeff had been able to go out the last couple of days before the wedding , to shoot the game for the feasting . They had chatted a little , between the sand grouse and the francolin and the ducks , sitting in the shade of an acacia and drinking a lukewarm beer . " What do you suppose it 's like , being married ? " Peter asked idly . " Make a whole lot of difference in a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jeff said , chewing on a grass stem and fumbling for his tobacco . " Slows a chap down a bit , I should n't wonder . I 've known a lot of blokes to change completely . One week they 're doing over all the girls and sloshing down grog madly till all hours , the next they 're dull 's dirt and scared pissless of the first frown out of the old lady . I imagine you worry a lot more , specially when the brats start to come and the problems increase . I certainly will have to spend a lot more time tending to the farm and a lot less in the bush . Chap ca n't just whiz offp104every time he gets a hankering for space , and leave the good woman to tend the pigs for six months . One of two things happens : Eventually he finds somebody else in his bed , or he makes the woman into a bloody shrew who 's cheesed off at him all the time he is home , and that 's no fun either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your house , chum . " Peter grinned . " I 've been brought up under the iron hand of this particular girl . She 'll wallop you as soon as kiss you , or more so , and she 's tough as a rhino kiboko . " " Glad of it , could n't be more pleased . No place , Kenya , for one of those sweetie-nicy , scream-at-a-mouse sort of Englishy girls that the boys all seem to fall for . The first time they find a hyena in the cookhouse or a leopard in the hen coop , it 's bung off to Merrie England again and back to Mother . Not for me . Your sister is Kenya-born and Kenya-raised . She 's seen a cow drop a calf and a hyena eat the calf , and me shoot the hyena . She has caught a cobra in the kitchen and found a scorpion in her shoe . She knows about drought and locust and grasshoppers and screwworm . At least I wo n't have to go through 11 that nuisance about trying to convert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're very lucky , " Peter said seriously . " She 's quite the nicestgirl I know . " " I reckon that to be high praise from any brother . And I know damned well I 'm lucky . Let 's go see about those ducks . " On the morning of the wedding the best man bathed very carefully and gave minute inspection to his fingernails . Finding them a bit grimy , he took his hunting knife and pared them closely , digging out as much of the entrenched soil as he could . He got out his best suit  --  his only proper suit  --  and hung it up in the back yard for a bit , to let the sweet early-morning breezes blow away some of the scent of moth balls . It was a blue double-breasted serge suit , and it fit him very badly . He had shot up like grass after the rains , and his knobby brown wrists stuck too far out of the sleeves . The coat was too short behind and stretched too tight across . Even dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were still too short and showed considerable sock . None of his shirts fit well enough to be buttoned , for Peter 's neck had swelled , and he never wore a tie , anyhow . Walking carefully down the hall , he knocked on his father 's bedroom door . There was no answer , so he entered the room and went over to the old-fashioned walnut high-P105boy where his father kept his town clothes . He pinched a clean white shirt off the top of a heap of freshly laundered shirts and went back to his room to finish dressing . The shirt , he found , fit him perfectly , causinghim a moment of amazement over the realization that he was big as his father . Jeff had bought him a necktie in Nairobi , and he looked at it with distaste . It was a pearl-gray cravat , slashed diagonally with black stripes . Peter thought that something in red or bright blue would be more fitting to a wedding , but Jeff had said to wear it or he 'd wallop him . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knot . Peter put a tie on about once a year , on average , and felt he was being garroted , like a giraffe caught in a fence , until he could rip it off again . " Christ , " Peter said half aloud as he jammed his feet into black calf shoes . " I would much rather be going on safari . When I marry I think I shall just grab the girl and run away to some registry office and do it without all this fuss . " Peter snapped open his lips , to inspect his teeth in the mirror , and daubed his downcurving bang of black hair with some pomade , slicking it back . It was a funny face now , a small bit boy , more of it man . The teeth were white against the baked brown , and the eyes very blue . His brown , muscular neck looked odd , swelling out of the starched white collar . " I look like a young wart hog trying to get out of a hole , " Peter said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bride 's kissed and the happy couple away . Ca n't see why people wear these things for fun . My feet are starting to hurt already in these damned spy shoes . I think perhaps , if nobody 's about , I shall just whip down and borrow a beer . Make myselfabsent until Jeff shows up . Where 's the bloody ring ? Oh , good . Safe and sound . " He could hear all sorts of rustly , busily sounds coming from Elisabeth 's room , and skirted it swiftly . There was a staccato chatter of Swahili as she directed the maids in some female doings or other . Peter went down to the living room and saw his father pouring a gin for himself from the sideboard . On the lawn , people were milling . Horses were tethered , cars drawn up , teams outspanned , and carts standing forlorn , their shafts slanted to earth . There was a gabble of conversation from the visitors . It sounded to Peter like a flight of knob-billed geese flying low over the marshes at sundown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gin into a glass . He too was gallantly arrayed in his rusty best , another blue suit which , while it fit him more precisely thanp106Peter 's suit fit Peter , seemed equally uneasy on his body . His big outflangedears and bushy mustache conformed oddly to a stiff white collar that left a red mark on the brown of his neck . The unbaked white of his balding head exactly matched his collar . Peter had to laugh . " We both look like a couple of tame animals dressed up for a variety turn , " he said . " I feel like a performing bear in these clothes . " " Me too , " his father said . " I am not much of a man for gin in the morning , but I felt I could n't face that stampede out there without a peg . Would you care to join me , son , in honor of this great day ? Not that I approve of it as a habit . " " Yes , thanks , " Peter said , feeling very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " What 'll it be ? " " Gin , please , with a little pink . " His father 's eyebrows shot up , but he poured a good-sized dollop of gin into a small glass and seasoned it with bitters . Peter watched the pink swirl through the clearness of the gin and raised his glass to his father . " Cheers , " he said . " To the blushing bride . " " Cheers , " the old man said . ' To the lucky groom . And he is a lucky groom , by God , at that . If he uses her badly I 'll kill him happily . " " I doubt you 'll have to , " Peter replied . " Judging from our experience , it 's more likely she 'll beat him . " " I think perhaps you may be right . Let 's go and welcome the guests and try to keep ' em just a touch sober until after the ceremony . " " That , " Peter said , " would call for a territorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was going to be the bride 's attendant , ran a bath and dumped some of her mother 's bath salts , which she had stolen , into it . Holly 's head was full of bridal thoughts as she stretched in the big tub , solemnly regarding the pink mosquito bites which represented her nipples , and wondering how long it would be before she pooched out in front like Elisabeth . In Holly 's mind there was something mysterious connected between matrimony and breasts that pooched out the front of a frock . Holly knew very well that babies were born because of something men and women did to each other , but she was a trifle confused about the process . She knew that babies were built in their mumma 's tummy ,  |p107and  the husband did something peculiar to put them there , and that it had to be the odd machinery which distinguished boys from girls . But she did n't think it would be much fun . It would probably be painful . If she were getting married , there would n't be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday , maybe in France or England , and then if the husband were very good , she might consent to let him make a baby . Her mumma had just produced one , a wrinkled , nasty little red boy , named Jerry , and she was still feeling dreadful . Holly remembered that her mumma threw up every morning for months and that Elisabeth had told her it had something to do with the baby in her mumma 's tummy . Holly looked at her flat tummy and wondered if there would ever be a baby in it . Then she wondered whose baby it would be , and settled then and there on Peter . Holly got out of the tub and put on a pair of pink rayon pants and a bathrobe . She dug her toes into zebra-hide slippers and slopped down to the living room for her brekkers . She had had tea and toast , of course , brought to her on waking by Kamia , the Kikuyu headboy , but the day had made her excited and the bath had spurred her appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ducks , " her mother said . " I waited to have my coffee with you . Daddy 's off somewhere on his horse . All ready for the wed-ding ? " " I had a bath , " Holly said . " You smell like it . My bath salts , doubtless ? " " Yes , Mum . I did n't think you 'd mind this once . They make you feel just lovely all over , do n't they ? " " That 's the general idea , love , " her mother said . " Hungry ? " " Ravenous . I 've heard brides do n't eat ; is that so ? " " I was starved on my wedding day . I ate like a horse . Then I got so excited I threw up . " " That wo n't happen to me , " Holly said , starting on the cold seedspeckedyellow papaya that Kamia set before her . She followed the papaya with scrambled eggs and ham and hot bread and marmalade and drank three cups of strong tea . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I expect I 'd best try it on now . " " It 's a lovely dress , darling . Let 's go and see it , shall we ? " It was a lovely dress , of starchy white embroidered organdy . Holly slipped into a stiff cotton petticoat to make the frock flare , and it stoodp108off from her long legs like a ruff . Her mother tied a blue velvet sash round her waist . She whirled , still in her slippers , admiring herself in the mirror . " You look a treat , sweetie , " her mother said . " Now take it off , becausewe do n't want to muss it . " " I 'd rather have a long dress , " Holly said . " I look such a child in this , and I 'm not a child any more . " " I 'm afraid you 're still classifiable'as a mtoto , " her mother said . " But it 'll be all too soon when you 're dressing for your own wedding . " " With Peter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mirror and thinking that it looked carroty . " I expect he 'll make a very nice husband for me . And he lives so close it 'll be very convenient for everybody . What a horrible boy he is ; he probably will make an elegant man . But now he smells sort of bad from all those animals he 's always doing about . " " Peter 's a very nice boy , and I 'm sure he will make a wonderful husband . Now take off the dress and go and choose some roses for your tiara . All the better bridesmaids wear tiaras this year , I 'm told . Get some of those little pinky ones . They 'll be sweet with the dress . " " Is being married fun , Mum ? Always having a man about , I mean ? " " Perhaps you could n't call it fun , " her mother said . " But it 's sort of necessary to a girl 's peace of mind , unless she really wants to be an old maid , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and do your flowers . I must dress myself and feed the baby and we must n't be late . " " What do husbands and wives actually do , Mum ? I mean , what do they do that makes them different from just being engaged ? I do n't mean kissing and all that nonsense . " " Someday I 'll tell you , " her mother replied . " But now I 'm busy . Off you go . " Holly put on a pair of khaki shorts and a jumper and stuck her feet into jodhpur boots . She turned an exuberant cartwheel as she entered the flower garden . Her breakfast felt fine and warm inside her , and the sun added an extra freckle to her nose , and she thought it was just simply a marvelous day for anything , but she wished she were going hunting with Peter instead of wearing that silly little girl 's dress and a dumb old tiara of roses on her head . But the roses , heavy with big fat tears of dew , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the shears and warily stalked one of the rosebushes , as she had seen Peter do withp109animals . She did n't want to be gored by the thorns , not if she could help it . Jeff Newton dressed very carefully in his naval uniform , which for some peculiar reason his bride had insisted he wear . It was heavy doeskin No . I 's and was a bit musty despite its airing . The stiff white collar looked very strange with its neat black tie , although it had n't been so long ago when this tie had hung over the backs of some very strange chairs , hastily torn off and tossed back-handed while he unmoored his trousers and kicked off his shoes . " Well , " he said to himself . " There 's the end of that . No more fun and games for the lieutenant . Geoffrey Newton , husband . Geoffrey Newton , father . Crikey . Never thought I would face this day , not so soon , anyhow . If the bloody destroyer had n't pranged me I 'd still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's if I was n't dead , which is fairly likely . " It was a lot of fun , though , and I 'm glad I had it . Think it 's bloody foolish for a man to come into the marriage cot not knowing much , and God knows the opportunities out here are pretty seldom . One thing I can thank old Adolf for  --  he got me out of Kenya and into a lot of wonderful beds . What was the name of that one in Surrey on that long week end ? Peggy ? No . Sheila ? No . Ah , yes , Leslie . Lovely little thing , and a dirty shame she got blown up in the blitz . What 's this on the chin ? A pimple ? No . Only a tsetse bite . " Hope that little bugger Peter has n't gone and lost the ring . And thank God those ruffians I used to run with are all off protecting us from the Hun . No telling what they 'd have thought up in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Probably kidnaped me and held me prisoner for a week or something , laughing madly all the while . The old boys 'll be drunk , but not so exuberant . " I say , " Jeff said to the lavender-water bottle , dousing himself with the lotion , " I shall have a bloody good try at making her happy . She is such a bloody wonderful girl . And now I shall have a drink to the bride . " He walked over to the sideboard in his bedroom and seized a partiallyempty bottle of John Haig . He toasted the morning and said : " Here 's to you , old lady , and long may we last , because I love you very much and want at least ten kids . " He took a heavy swig from the bottle , shuddered , and smiled at himself in the mirror as he began to brush his mustache . " What the hellp110she ever saw in me , I do n't know , unless it was the pure gold that shines from me soul , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And did . The bride shooed the Kikuyu maids from her room and did a most unbridal thing . She took off her clothes , lit a cigarette , lay full length on the bed as naked as a Turkana girl , and sipped slowly from a bottle of beer . The beer tasted just fine , even if it was unmaidenly . I wonder , Elisabeth thought , if I will be any good in bed . I hope I shall be , because I 'm told it 's quite important . This monster I 'm marrying , and how sweet he is , with that ridiculous mustache , must have been in and out of half the beds in England . He never talks about it , but he 's got a way with him that must have led him straight to all the bitches on the loose in London . He could have had me for a farthing any time since he got back , but I think it 's rather dear of him that he did n't . Means I 'm a little specialler than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for a treat . I suppose I 'd best be all dewy and virginal and frightfully bridy whilst everyone 's looking on , but I can barely wait to get the man in that big suite in the Outspan . I 'll show him a couple things he never learned from that nasty Lady Something that used to write him all the time . But not to get preggie too early . There 's nothing I can think of less appetizing than a woman who 's always sick in the morning , with her skin all blotches and her tummy pushed out in front of her like a wheelbarrow . I 'll not have this lad looking round about him too soon because I 'm so horrible . My , this beer is good . I suppose poor old Mum is shuddering right now at the idea of her daughter drinking beer and thinking about sex . Odd there 's not a decent name for the actual act . Fornication 's nasty . So 's intercourse . So 's " sexual congress . " Come and have sexual congress with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are funnier , but none of it describes a thing that 's supposed to be so important . I 've heard ' em all , one time or another , and to me that most dreadful word is very funny , even if nobody 's supposed to say it , and " poking " reminds me of a bad little boy doing something horrible with a stick . This beer is good . But I wonder what this wonderful man of mine would say if , after we 've left the party and go to the Outspan , I looked demurely at him and said : ' Well , come on , my good fellow , do n't hang about . Let 's nip upstairs and get on with the poking . " He 'd drop dead , and I 'd be the only virginal widow in history.  |p111The  idea amused Elisabeth very much . Having been raised among and entirely with men and animals in their most basic relationship with each other , and having kept her eyes pinned on the doings in the fancy set in Eldoret and Muthaiga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard all the words used naturally . She had read most of the books and knew about the things her young male friends did in town when taken a little in drink . She had stumbled over more than one good girl friend , frock tumbled in the azaleas , after a wet party at the club in Limuru ; she knew all about why young John Masters shot young Arch Williams , and why Polly Stanton had such an early baby , and by the wrong husband , because she had to marry that awful old Tom Desmond in a hurry . " I doubt very much if it 's as much fun when you 're married as it is when you grab it under a bush , " she said coarsely , looking downward over her body , which lay pink and spraddle-legged on the bed . " But I 'm not an entirely nasty bit of work , and I intend to get as much fun as possible out of this baby-making business , even if there is n't a lovely word for it . Ah , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on with my frills and ruffles , including the lacy pants . I wonder if it 'll hurt much . " Elisabeth finished her beer , smacked her lips , and yelled for Wamboye to come and fix her bath . She grinned . " Guess my lad 's a stickler for cleanliness , if that story about the Masai girl is in point . At least I 'll come to him without any odious diseases I can think of . He is a dear , Jeff , and I am certainly the luckiest woman in Kenya to have sna lied him . I expect he 'll want at least twelve children , all of them at once , so he can buy elephant guns for the boys and teach them to hunt before they walk . Well , bride . It certainly is a nice day for it , whatever they call it , and I shall now anoint the fair white body with spices and crawl into my bride clothes . It would have been very nice if poor Mum could have stuck around a bit longer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy . " Elisabeth plunged into her bath , where she happily snorted and kicked , her hair safely done up in a towel , for half an hour . Then she got out of the tub , dried , slipped into a robe , and had another beer . It tasted better , if anything , than the other . She was half asleep on the bed when Wamboye knocked on the door.  | " Please excuse me , Memsaab , " the maid said . " But you 're wanted down at the compound of Ngatia . His wife is very ill and is asking for you . She has a great pain in the stomach . " " Oh , for God 's sake , " Elisabeth said , rolling out of bed . " Hand me some trousers and a sweater , and go to the medicine chest for some salts and paregoric . You would think that on a wedding day the bride would have at least one free hour from some Wog 's stomach-ache . Here , not those shoes . The slippers 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-necked sweater and went down to the native shambas . She thought as she walked with the medicines in her hand that she would need another bath when she came back to dress for her wedding . The bride was unbelievably lovely in her grandmother 's Empire wedding gown . Elisabeth had diminished the bustle to a mere suggestion and had eliminated the train . The dress was of white lace over a satin slip , with long , close-fitting sleeves that came to points on her hands . She had snipped the yards and yards of veil to where it barely reached her hips . The neck was high and square , and she wore the pearls of Jeff 's mother . When she looked at Jeff as she came in on the arm of her father , and gave him a not entirely demure smile , Jeff 's stomach turned as it had turned when a buffalo came snorting , wounded , from the bush .

But there was an extra bristle to his unnavalmustache , which seemed to be a thorn bush set afire . Peter had the ring squeezed around the tip of his littlest finger . As young Holly Keith came in , a crown of pink roses on her head and her organdy dress saucy over her white socks and flat-heeled patent-leather shoes , Peter thought , My , what a pretty little girl , and really not such a dreadful nuisance . Might n't be bad-looking with that red hair and green eyes when she gets a little older . Everyone said there had never been a prettier bride , and that hound , Jeff , was a bloody lucky dog to get such a pretty one , and was n't it nice that the two farms were so close , no trouble over boundaries , and that young devil , Peter , was getting on for being quite a man , big or bigger than his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seep113It , but lucky for Henry , he was n't actually losing a daughter so much as pining another son , for everybody knew that young Peter worshiped Jeff 's shadow , and there was no need for anybody to be lonesome , espedailyafter the grandchildren start to come and young Peter takes over on the farm . And now , now that the rector has tied up everything nice and neat , let us go and kiss the bride and shake the bridegroom 's hand , and t hen let us have a bit of a look at the grog . My bloody oath , old Henry 's clone himself well . Have n't seen so much champagne since the Prince of Wales was here . And those beautiful oysters , darling ; it must have cost a fortune . Well , young Elisabeth . All the very best , and you 're a lucky clog , Jeff . Mind you treat her well and give her lots of babies . You know the old say ; one in the lap and another on the way ... . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulations , and dived into the drink . The women flowed to each other in smallerpools , mostly according to age . The older ones inspected the presents , andthe younger , prettier ones slid quietly over to what few young men wereavailable . But it was not the young , freshly pretty faces and the slimyoung legs and proudly carried bodies that really explained the group . The older women , fat and skinny , were cut in the same pattern . They wore their dresses as if they had been borrowed or shaken out ofmoth balls for the occasion . Most of the oatmeal-tweed skirts bagged atthe seat . The corseting was all wrong , leaving odd bumps and pointsunder the clothes . Most of the older women wore stout shoes and common-sensestockings . Quite a few wore men 's broad-brimmed slouch hats , slanted over one eye , hats from which wisps of hair straggled loosely . Nearly all had false teeth which fitted badly . Without exception , they were baked sallow-brown by years of sun , and their eyes , mostlyblue , seemed diluted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some big of bone , but all close-honed , nearly allprematurely gray , many stooped . No amount of cream lotion couldfreshen once-delicate English complexions which had been dried bywind , coarsened and roughened by alkali dust , and broiled by sun . Allthe women had white creases of wrinkles around their eyes , causedp114by squinting . Their hands were either heavy and callused or worn fine , as a cake of soap maintains original shape but erodes with use . On many , the wrists were as ropy as men 's wrists , thickened from riding and lifting , and under the frocks , some thighs were as heavily muscled as men 's , from years on horseback . Most of them now were medium rich or well to do , in the new prosperity of the war , with their farms secure and money in the bank . But at one time or another most had trod fearfully , gently , on the delicate crust of desperate failure and had known tremendous toil and hardship . Some had borne their children with only an old hag from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All had washed and scrubbed and planted and cooked and plowed and fought fire in the dry season , had squelched through the impossible red muck of the rains , had battled to save the lives of their beasts , knew wind and dust and the necessary earth that washed and blew away , and had lived at altitudes which turned women old at thirty . They had their security now , and some even riches , but they had bought it dearly , hewing an approximation of Englishlife out of virgin African bush and stone . Few of the old ones had been born in Africa . They had come out as young marrieds and as children , fresh from the misty green trees , clipped yew-hedged cool lawns and perennial flower-bright gardens of England , to confront a land in which harsh climate , animal , and man offered a constant , daily challenge . Women who once screamed at a mouse had driven lions from the cattle pastures . Women who had been reared gently by Scotch nanniesnow had filed-toothed savages as nursemaids for their babies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in a city house now spent months alone , but for a savage or two , on desolate farms while the men were on safari or off to the wars . Women who used to be desperatewhen a stoat got at the chickens now found leopards and civet cats in the hen coop , with elephants and buffalo trampling down the flower beds and wart hogs rooting up the potatoes and hyenas waiting expectantlyfor anything , human or animal , that might be weak , small , or sick . There was no woman there who could not remember running onto a rhino in the footpath , or an elephant bulking huge and blocking the road . One woman 's baby had been taken by a hyena . Their wrists and faces were permanently scarred with the bites of mosquitoes and tsetse flies , and when they took up a gun they handled it as swiftly and as competently as a man . They inspected their shoes each morning to see if there might be a scorpion inside , and the killing of a cobra or a mambap115or a boomslag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outrideworld was mainly a battery-driven radio which received the BBC broadcast relayed through Nairobi or Dar-es-Salaam and which usually failed at a crucial moment in the news . Their music came from handcrankedphonographs and consisted of selections from such modem operettas as Chu Chin Chow , The Chocolate Soldier , Blossom Time , and The Merry Widow . They were used to solitude . Save for the ones who lived on the fringes of towns like Fort Hall , Nakuru , Nyeri , Nanyuki , Thika , Eldoret , Nairobi , and Kusumu , going to town was a threeorfour-times-yearly occasion , especially since petrol was short owing to the war , and a near neighbor might be fifty or sixty miles away . They were used to loneliness , and were happy in it , now they had cookboys and Number One boys and kitchen mtotos and many black hands to feed and tend the flocks and turn the soil for wheat and coffee and tea and pyrethrum and pineapples . But they still drove the trucks to town and pitched in at whatever daily crisis called them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman with whom she lived at Mwega , on a huge farm at the edge of the Aberdares . Sally Henderson 's husband had died of blackwater fever four years ago . Marian Sorrell had divorced her husband in a nasty affair which involveda non-fatal shooting . Now Marian and Sally  --  Marian lean , horsefaced , and sinewy , and Sally big , broad , blowzy-blond , with a deep bosom and a man 's booming voice  --  lived together and worked the farm , running a labor force of more than one hundred Kikuyu . The farm spread downward on the slopes of a mountain . The farmhouse was perched high atop the mountain . Dressed today in light summer frocks and floppy picture hats , Sally and Marian looked like two tough old men masquerading in women 's clothes , because for three hundred and fifty days a year they wore blue jeans , flannel shirts , and ankle boots . Either could hit a running dik-dik , no bigger than a hare , with a pistol at fifty yards . Either could break a fractious colt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill an elephant . Either could mend harness , fix the Delco light machine , rip the guts out of an auto , or repair a tractor . Neither could cook worth a damn , as Sally was then saying in her deep , rough voice . " I could n't be happier , " she said . " We 've finally found the most wonderful cook . He used to cook for John Martin 's safari outfit , but he got hurt when they turtled a lorry somewhere in Tanganyika and he ca n't do safaris any more . But he learnt to cook for American millionaires and Spanish grandees and dago counts , and he is simply divine . Makes thep116finest lemon tart I ever laid mouth to . For a while I thought I 'd have to kill Marian . She has n't a clue in the kitchen . " " No more have you , sweetie . Everything that Sally makes tastes like either boot or glue . After she sacked that last cook we bloody near starved . I ca n't cook , which is maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying deceitful soul , wherever he may be . I 'm all thumbs and I never know how big a pinch of this or a touch of that is supposed to be . Gim me a cigarette , Sally . " She accepted the cigarette , took a kitchen match out of her pocket , and automatically started to strike it on the seat of her pants . Remembering swiftly that she was wearing a dress , she cracked the match head expertly with her thumbnail and took a deep drag , exhaling tvvo thin streams through her nose . " What happened to the other cook ? " somebody asked . " I thought you had a wizard in that last Kyuke . " " Cheeky blighter , he was , and a thief as well , " Sally said . " I had to sack him a month ago . He pinched everything  --  cigarettes , sugar , salt , tea , grog . But when he pinched a box of Marian 's Kotex  --  God knows what he wanted with it  --  he went too far , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you . He came back drunk and ugly a week later , and I powdered his pants with a charge of No. 8 shot . He 's not been back since , and if he does return I 'll use a larger charge on his black backside . " " We never seem to have any trouble up there except with the kitchen , otherwise we 'd be happy as sandboys , " Marian said . " Cattle all fine , and a ripping crop this year . I 've had a lot of books sent out , and the wireless works beautifully . Some admirer of Sally 's  --  blighter 's probablygot his eye on the farm  --  just gave her the two most adorable Dobermanpuppies you ever saw . We 've got enough grog to last out the war  --  thank God Henderson was a toper , his cellar 's still fantastic  --  and enough near neighbors in Nanyuki and Nyeri to drop in on for a drink when the horses need exercising .

It 's no good our always winning each other 's money . " The women drifted over to inspect the new young bay stallion that had come as a wedding gift from Sir James , he of the wooden leg .

I 'm sure Charles has known about it for a long time , but he was by way of being in no shape to take notice of it , not with that little bit he 's been sneaking off with in Thomson 's Falls .

And after all , he is Piers 's best friend . Piers got clean away , with his shoes in hand , more or less , and then Charles went in and gave Leslie a hell of a hiding . Not that she did n't deserve it . I 'm told there 'll be a divorce now , and Piers 'll have to marry her . Pity , because he 's clung onto being a bachelor and poaching other men 's women for so long now .... " Shush . Here comes Leslie . " A slim , blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most , strode up . She was wearing a short printed silk frock and had elegant long legs in high-heeled shoes . She also had a lovely black eye under her sunglasses . " Hullo , " she said . " Doing me over ?

Only decent thing he could do after giving me this , " and she flicked the glasses off her purpled eye . " Not that I had n't it coming , in one way , but you 'd think his conscience , if so he has one , might 've argued a little restraint . You see , I 've known for ages about what he does in Thomson 's Falls , and with whom . Whoa , there , now I must be going . She did n't have the decency to stop on home .

The few young adults , nearly without exception , all had some physical defect , such as young Sir James 's lost leg ; a chronic eye weakness masked behind inch-thick lenses , such as young Robin Masters , who was blinkingowlishly in the bright sunlight .

He went over and cut the head off the thing , butchered it , and went home . Next day one of the Game Department lads came on the head , and all the old Boer had shot was the world 's record bongo . Considering that you ca n't even see ' em except every seven years , when the wild grape dies . . . and this old bastard does n't even know what he 's shot .

What about another , seeing as old Henry 's paying . . . " The men strolled back and forth across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of personal news and gossip to swap , because only once in donkey 's years did they get a chance to congregate . There were brothers who had not seen each other in two years , sisters separated by corrugated clay roads as thoroughly as by an ocean . Mostly the men had not dressed up for the wedding . Sir James had on a polka-dotted blue muffler inside his clean white polo shirt and was wearing an old tweed coat with flannels . Lord Waterholme had , for some reason or other , resuscitated a dove-gray morning suit , with gray topper , from its nest of moth balls and was resplendent with a bright buttonhole . But mostly the men worep122drill or corduroy bush coats , with short sleeves and bullet loops . A few wore shorts ; most had their trousers tucked into the tops of jodhpur boots . Kenya dust made any uniform indistinguishable after a few miles over the lava-drifting tracks . By one o'clock , most were in various stages of drunkenness and were sweating freely . Peter was drunk , as well . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had been heartily accepted into the male society as a man grown , and he had made the grievous error of matching gins with old soakers whose stomachs were lined with zinc and whose hobnailed livers had long since ceased trying to fight back . Peter had drifted over to a group of professional hunters turned fanner since the war had stopped hunting , and was lost in a ginny fog of admiration as the men swapped stories , some of which contained a grain or so of truth , about the old days , when the Game Department was more reasonable and a man could get rich in one good year poaching ivory in the Lado Enclave . Late in the afternoon the lawn started to spin for Peter , and he made his way to the stream , where he was violently sick . He went , pale and shaken , back to his bedroom , and for the first time in his life he passed out . When he awoke it was dark , and the guests  --  those who could still stand  --  were dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They looked exactly like a bunch of Masai warriors warming themselves up for a big ngoma . Portions of the party lasted three days , during which time Derek Johns found his wife , Emily , kissing Tom Dawson , and a splendid fist fight followed . Emily Armstrong drifted down to the stream in the moonlight with her fiance , Cedric Holmes , who was back on a short leave from Addis Ababa , and Emily became pregnant , thereby hastening her marriage . There was a big , though separate , feasting in the blacks ' compound , and much beer was drunk in honor of the wedding . Lady Waterholme had too much champagne , becameill , and had to have her stays removed . Sir James Fitzroyce fell off his Arab horse and broke his remaining leg , and Donald Considine pranged his jeep going home when he ran full-tilt into a herd of zebras crossing the road . He suffered only a mild concussion , but the jeep was a total loss , as was one zebra . The party splintered and broke up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi . Some progressedto Limuru and horrified the stewards of the golf club . Everyone agreed that it could n't have been a nicer wedding . The blacks were a bitp123puzzled , since they had been forbidden to dance certain dances by the Crown and too much beer drinking was frowned on . Henry McKenzie decided not to notice that his young son , Peter , had been disastrously drunk off a mixture of wine , gin , beer , and whisky on the afternoon of the wedding . Peter had disappeared with his horse and gun the following day and returned only as the last guests were leaving . " Thank God that 's over , son , " Henry McKenzie said . " Care for a spot ? " " No , thank you , sir , " Peter said . " I 'm going to bed . " " So am I , " said Henry McKenzie , downing a neat whisky and shuddering as it hit bottom . " I 'm glad I have n't got any more daughters to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stumped up the steps and headed for his room . Already Juma , the headboy , and his assistants were beginning to clear up the wreckage . It had been a very good wedding . In jail , Karanja got drunk off beer which Henry McKenzie had commandedthe Meru jailer to fetch his old friend . Karanja was very sorry he had missed seeing the little Memsaab marry the Bwana Jeff . It was all part of the thahu , and he hoped that none of the thahu would affect the lives of the Bwana Jeff and the Memsaab Elisabeth . There had been too much trouble already . Karanja took another gulp of beer and smiled as he remembered his first wedding . What a wedding that had been ! The crops had been good that year , and the flocks had thrived . Karanja was a full-fledged njama now , and he wanted a wife . He had been dancing for two years since he became a warrior , and he had lain in the huts after the dances with many maidens . But he had scrupulously observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not impregnatedany girl , although the experiences were frustrating in light of his memories of the Masai maid . Finally he settled on Kamore , daughter of Koinange , a respected elder , although poor . Kamore was beautiful , fat and shining like a zebra filly , with strong legs and bigp124breasts . He had lain with her often in her mother 's hut , and he knew she loved him . Also , he had noted that she worked very hard , helping her mother cultivate her father 's fields . Her broad pelvis would yield him many sons , and her strong back would never tire beneath its load of firewood , of bananas , of wattle saplings and potato tops . Karanja consulted his father , who agreed that the choice was good . Karanja then asked his mother to make him some cane beer , and then he went to the wife of his circumcision sponsor , to ask her to go with him to call on Koinange , the father of the woman he wished to marry . Koinange was sitting on his heels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relatives , when Karanja came with Wairimu , the wife of his circumcision sponsor . Wairimu was carrying two gourds of beer suspended from a limber stick across her shoulders . Karanja offered a polite formal greeting and squatted on his heels . Wairimu set down the beer gourds in the shade and joined the wives of Koinange underneath a nearby fig . The women chattered excitedly , like squirrels , but the men talked sensibly of crops and rains for a long time . Then Karanja said gravely : " For some time I have partnered your daughter at the dances and I have lain with her in her mother 's hut . I have not removed the second apron from her , and so I come to you in honor , with my father 's permission to speak . I have also watched your daughter labor in the fields of your shamba , and I have noted that she is a steady and diligent worker . " " She is a good girl , " Koinange said . " She is obedient and healthy and fat , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want her to come and cultivate the fields of my shamba , for now I am a warrior and a man and I need a woman to tend my shamba and dig deep around the roots of my plantings , so that they may grow well and bring prosperity to my house . " Koinange clapped his hands and jerked his head at the women . They joined the group of men , with Wairimu bringing along the beer . " Do you consent to till the shamba of Karanja , son of Kimani ? " he asked his daughter , whose eyes glistened wide . " Yes , " Kamore said . " I consent . " She bowed her head . Kamore 's mother took the beer gourds from Wairimu and poured out a hornful . She handed the horn to Koinange . He turned to face his daughter again . " If this man does not please you , I shall spill this beer upon the ground , " he said . " Do not spill the beer , " replied Kamore . " Drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , he filled itp125end handed it to each of his wives and to his assembled kinsmen . They drank . Then the wife of Karanja 's circumcision sponsor went off to fetch Kimani , the father of Karanja . The men thereafter haggled all day in the shade of the big cedar tree , drinking beer and discussing the bride price . Koinange said that his daughter , being so fat , so comely , and so industrious , was worth more than the usual thirty goats . This fact was admitted . The price was finally settled on thirty goats , six fat rams , twenty gourds of beer , and a long-term payment of ten goats for the first child and five goats for each successive child , up to five . It was a very dear price to pay for a woman . There was a great to-do about choosing the goats from the herd of Karanja 's father . There must be some fat ones , of course , and some medium-grade ones , and an equal number of thin ones , to strike a balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , together with two friends of his own age grade , drove the goats to the shamba of Koinange . The father of the bride carefully looked at the teeth , hoofs , and bellies of each , lifting them to test their weight , and a very long argument followed . Then Koinange accepted the goats . The next day ten more goats and three of the six fat-tailed rams were driven over , and Koinange accepted these , as well , after protesting that he was being robbed . The next day was the day of the first big beer drink , and all the womenfolk of Karanja 's household went over to Koinange 's shamba , bearing gourds frothy-full . One of the fat rams was slaughtered , and all day long the two families drank , danced , and feasted . The bridegroom 's mother poured gruel over her head as a sign of happiness , and the empty gourds were stuffed with grass , signifying friendship between the two clans , and the bridegroom and his family staggered home , drunk and bloated with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karanja went in the cool of the evening to beseech land from the chief of his clan and was given an unclaimed plot adjoining the shamba of his father . While Karanja and his entire circumcision group busied themselves in breaking the ground and clearing the brush from the new shamba , the womenfolk of his clan massed to grind cane for more beer , because the ceremonial drinking had just begun . There were three momumental drunks in the shamba of the bridegroom 's father , the drunk of the building of the new home , the drunk for its furnishing , and finally the drunk for the taking of the bride . More fat rams were killed and roasted.  |p126Karanja  remembered that every morning he had a colossal hangover as he and his age companions went out to uproot stumps and dig ground ; that his skull felt constricted by a tight cord , faery specks danced before his eyes , and there were ominous upsurgings in his throat . But on the final day , the day of the bride-taking , he and his friends built a mud foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clan were busy all day long , weaving thatch for its roof and for the roof of the beehive-like granary which stood to one side . When evening came a group of Karanja 's circumcision brothers dressed magnificently in ostrich-feather headdresses and paint of lime and ocher , wearing rattles on their legs and bracelets on their arms . As Kamore came out of her mother 's hut , they ambushed her and carried her , screeching and kicking , to the new hut . They shoved her through the doorway and then left her alone . She remained in the hut for four days , loudly weeping , and singing sad songs  --  songs which had been taught her as part of her circumcision instruction and which were shaped to extol her clan and appease its members for her decision to desert it for the clan of another . All this time Karanja feasted with the bachelors , sleeping in the thingira , and not once daring to see his bride . Food was brought to the bride by the groom 's mother , and her only other visitors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fourth day she paid a formal call on her family , returning at nightfall to what was now her own hut . That night Karanja crawled through the door and settled down beside her on the goatskin bed . He could not see her in the dark , but he could smell the fragrance of the fat with which she had been smeared by his mother . Karanja 's hands groped for her big breasts and then swiftly tore off the second apron . He entered her greased body , snorting and snuffling heavily , like a bull , and she moved her loins upward eagerly to meet him . This time he did not have to leave the body of a dead girl . After he had spent himself , she caressed him until soon he was ready to enter her again , and now he knew fulfillment . The next morning he got up from Kamore 's bed and took the last offering of beer to her father , and the final three fat rams , as payment for the theft and rapine of his daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prepared and brought to the bridal hut by Karanja 's mother , and the bride did no work whatsoever . At the end of thirty days Kamore 's head was shaved and she went to pay a final visit to her family . This was the last chance to annul the marriage . By a sign she could say that she was not happyp127with this man , her husband , and the bride price would be grudgingly repaid . No one 's honor would be damaged , and even though she might be pregnant , no stain would attach to her character , and she would again be eligible for marriage , although there would be less hesitancy about observing the formalities of the second apron , because a cow heavy with calf could not be damaged by the seed of another bull . But Karanja had been a faithful and sturdy mate to her , mounting her daily several times , and her menses did not flow at the appointed time . She judged herself to be happily pregnant and placed a bunch of flowers before her face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young goat as a final present from her family , and her mother poured sheep 's fat over her head and neck . She was given also a gourd of gruel to take back to her husband , and she returned at nightfall to her own hut as wife , no longer bride . Her wifely duties began the next day . She went to the forest to gather firewood and returned home behind Karanja , bearing an enormous load of dry wattle , thorn twigs , and small logs of punk , which , held by a strap round her forehead , she carried on her back . Then Karanja took her to the river to choose the three stones which would form her cooking hearth . These stones were the most sacred symbol of marriage and would be so closely tied to her new life that they might never be left behind without extra-special purification against an emergency of the most violentnature . Karanja also gave her digging implements , cooking pots , and gourds . His mother brought the beans for the first meal . The honeymoonwas over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattled the bars , and the pocked Meru came again . Karanja thrust his beer pannikin at the turnkey , who returned with another gourd . The Big Bwana had bribed him well . Karanja drank deep again and sighed as he remembered . Because in six months , as the fields waved plumy-green and the birds sang in the high trees , the big sickness came . In a few days Kamore and the baby she carried in her belly were dead . It was after that he met the Big Bwana , and a long time after that before he was able to afford to marry his second wife , Wangu , mother of his son , Kimani , and his second son , Kibarara . Kimani , who bore the name of Karanja 's father and who now possessed a thahu which had put Karanja in the white man 's jail hut . Karanja sighed again and reached for the beer . As long as that son of a Meru hyena kept bringing it on the Bwana 's orders , things might be worse , although he was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeff Newton snatched the bride away and threw her in the automobile . Jeff and Elisabeth Newton went into the house to dress after the mammothmeal of oysters and game and barbecued beef , none of which they had touched . They had cut the cake  --  with a panga , appropriately , instead of a sword , which Jeff did not own , he being of the wartime Navy . They had drunk quite a lot of champagne , and both were feeling pleasantlytight . They had had no private time together , since all the women had to kiss Jeff ( to see how those mustaches actually feel , my dear ) and all the men had had to kiss Elisabeth ( to see what the lad 's letting himself in for , old chap ) and everyone had shaken hands and slapped the groom 's back , the men winking and leering and making the crude , good-humored jokes that have ever been the unfortunate penance of all bridegrooms . Jeff slipped into Peter 's room and shucked his uniform , throwing it carelessly on Peter 's bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft shirt . Elisabeth ducked away at the same time and went to her room , with Holly Keith 's mother , to change to a white gabardine suit and a blouse which almost but not quite matched her eyes . Peter , by then pleasantly fiddled but still not yet drunk , came with Juma and took Elisabeth 's bags , Peter remaining by the Chev to ward off the lastminuteviolent humor and to superintend the attachment of shoes , gin bottles , biscuit tins , and one dead wart hog , which some wag had shot and tied to the bumper , just under the " Just Married " scrawl . Jeff called a servant and had his own bags sent out and then went back to the lawn party to have a final peg with the gentlemen while the bride dressed . The bride appeared swiftly , pitched her bouquet at young Holly Keith , and fled like a cheetah for the truck , with Jeff just behind her , and the crowd baying at their heels , screaming like foxhounds before a kill , and pelting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding cake . Jeff popped Elisabeth into the seat , locked the door , and jumped into the car . He trod on the starter , which exploded with a dreadful blast and removed a good bit of his mustache and most of his eyebrows , since one of the merrie gentlemen had thoughtfully affixed a small pow/der charge to the treadle . But the engine caught and the lorry lurched away , while several enthusiastic friends fired at it with weapons ranging from elephant rifles to pistols . It was typical of the gentle send-off that only one slug actually hit the truck , glancing off the roof , because no Kenya gentleman would ever seriously endanger a lady on her wedding day . " Light me a cigarette , will you , bride ? " Jeff said , steering the Chev around a pig hole and hitting another with a rattling thump as he turned to look at his wife . She lit the cigarette and placed it in his mouth . " Thanks awfully , darling . We 'll be onto the road in a jiffy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bits and bangles . I wonder what bloody idiot booby-trapped the starter ? Damn near marred me beauty for life . " " It was a sweet wedding , " Elisabeth said . " So well behaved , for that crowd . Only signs of sparks I noticed was when Leslie Simmons and her husband 's girl friend came to face , and I must say both were very good about it . Leslie looked charming with her black eye . " Jeff swerved the car off the plain and onto the track . He turned and looked at his wife . Her eyes were as big and blue as cornflowers , her mouth very soft and very red . He jammed his foot on the brake and the lorry ground to a stop , stalling . He took Elisabeth in his arms and kissed her hard , knocking her hat askew . Then he took her very lightly by the elbows and pushed her away , a little . " There 'll be none of that bloody nonsense in this family , on either side , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since I was a boy , and I shall beat you half to death if there 's any hanky-panky with anybody , I do n't care how bored you get . And you 're at liberty to shoot me , or have Peter do it . " " I love you very much , you great oaf , " Elisabeth said , straightening her hat . " Now come and kiss Mama very sweet , and let us drive on to Nyeri so we can get on with the more serious business . " " Nothing better than a basic woman , " Jeff said , kissing her on the end of the nose . " Now I 'll just chop off these tins and things and we 'll whiz off to the Outspan . " He climbed out of the car and walked round to the rear . " Well , for Christ 's sake , see who 's here . " Elisabeth turned her head and looked backward through the rear window . Perched on the mound of baggage was Lathela , the **35;8990;TOOLONG gunbearer . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feathers pinned to one side and a sheaf of brilliant blue guinea-fowl wing feathers on the other . Instead of his usual khaki shorts , he was wearing a pair of lady 's bright pink bloomers . He had found some old tan tennis shoes somewhere and had cut holes in them for his toes to stick out of . He smiled a sunburst of a grin and waved a hand . The other hand still contained his spear . " Jambo , Bwana , Jambo , Memsaab . Mimi na kuja kwa wewe . Iko hapa bundouki na lisase . " He pointed at a leather case and an iron box . " Bugger 's asked himself along on the honeymoon , " Jeff said . " And he 's certainly got up grand for it . I wonder where he found those drawers . They look about the right size for Sally Henderson . And he 's brought a bloody great gun case and a mound of cartridges , as well . I wonder what he thinks I intend to shoot on this safari . " " Whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Elisabeth said , and turned scarlet . " I mean ... " " I know what you mean , you shameless hussy , " Jeff said , climbing back into the car . " We might 's well take him . He can look after the luggage and things , and you never know when you 'll need a gun . Lathela ! Take your panga and cut off those tins ! " They drove quietly , talking little , on the road to Nyeri , and when they entered the courtyard of the Outspan Hotel , Jeff killed the car in front of one of the annexes . " That 's us , up there , " he said , pointing to a big corner room . " Everything 's fixed . We do n't have to go in through the hotel and listen to a lot of rude jokes and have everybody standing us a drink and flicking rice off us . I 'm glad it 's over now , are n't you ? " " Mmmm . Such a nice wedding . Such a nice hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty , beautiful , wonderful , gorgeous , amazing bride . Oversexed , maybe , but useful . We 'll just nip up to the rooms . Lathela ! Letti sandouki na bundouki na lisase , na kwenda tasama chakula . Na taka lala lorry . It 's just as well he hitched on , sweetie . He can fetch us the boxes and then go scrounge some food for himself , alert the reception that we 're here , and sleep in the lorry . Glad he came . " " So 'm I. I should n't like to face that group in the bar tonight . It 'll be bad enough tomorrow . Up we go , shall us ? " " Up we go , Mrs. Newton . Sounds strange . Mistress Newton . MemsaabNewton . A matron . " " Not yet I 'm not . I 'm still a bride , and do n't you forget it , my lad , P131and I 'm still subject to all the odd whims that are the right of brides . Are you going to carry me over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk on my poor sore feet in these new shoes ? " " Not only over , but up two flights , " said Jeff , and swept her up in his arms . " Here we go . Come on , Lathela , fetch the bags ! " The room Jeff carried Elisabeth into was not a room , but a vast beamed structure of white plaster , with a huge double bed and mirrored table , an armoire large enough to hide an elephant in , and two chintzy chairs . It let off into a large dressing room , which opened again on a grand bath , striped marble and regal . When you opened a door of the bedroom , you went down into the lounge , whose white wool rugs stretched before a fireplace large enough for a man to step into without stooping . Through the broad windows running the whole length of the room , one could see Mount Kenya  --  Kerinyagga  --  wreathed now in white clouds below the snaggled peak , backdropped by blue . There were bright pictures of Kikuyu men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster walls , and an enormous divan of blue , flanked by two white easy chairs . The room was banked with flowers , great sheaves of gladioli , roses , carnations , fern , and lilies of the valley . Jeff punched a buzzer button , still without dropping Elisabeth , then kissed her gently and set her on her feet . Lathela came in behind them with the first of the bags , and Jeff waved him to the dressing room . Behind Lathela came three room servants , barefoot black boys in white kanzus with red fezzes . They stowed the luggage , and one came to ask the Bwana which cases he would like opened . " This , " Jeff said , indicating his own bag , and then turned to Elisabeth . " I 'll open mine myself , " she said . " Right now I 'm cold . Let 's have a fire . " She hugged herself , grasping herself by the elbows . " I do n't know whether I 'm just nervous or if it 's the temperature drop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meself . First fire-lighting of what I hope 'll be a long and happy life , with maybe twenty kids . Presto ! Flame . What a wonderful thing a fire is . " The match licked out to the paper , and the paper caught the conifers and dry sticks which formed the tinder , and the tinder flared , and the great resiny logs responded eagerly to the flame . The fire crackled and then began to roar , and the white walls of the lounge were pinkened , then black-shadowed by the flames . The manager , frock-coated , stripedtrousered , arrived bowing . The flowers had been his . So was the side/board stocked with precious whisky , and the bottles of champagne that beaded in a silver bucket . " Hearty congratulations to you both , I 'm sure , " he said . " I 've taken the liberty of ordering you a little snack for later on . Ring when you want it . And anything I can do for the bride or groom . . . " " Nothing , nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are beautiful , and so is the grog . I do n't know about you , Elisabeth , but I 'm hungry . Did n't eat anything at lunch . What do you say to half an hour ? " " Lovely , I 'm starved too . I 'd like to get some of this dust off first . Thank you very much for the flowers , Mr. Manson . They are divine , and the champagne too . I 'm feeling dry after the trip in . Jeff , will you open a bottle and let 's all have a drink with Mr. Manson , and then I 'll just nip out and bathe . " " Allow me , " the manager said , and expertly thumbed the top off a bottle of Heidsick which had survived the war until now . He filled the glasses and raised his in a sweeping toast . " The beautiful bride , the lucky groom , " he said . " Here 's cheers , and the very best wishes for a long and happy . Cheers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now , if you 'll excuse me , I must just whiz off and see to your supper . Ring when you want it , and the boys 'll bring it . I 'll see you sha n't be disturbed . Good night , and again , congratulations . Good night , " and the manager bowed out backward , as only hotel managers know how . " Nice chap , Manson , you know , " Jeff said . " Jolly thoughtful of him . He knew we were coming , of course , and would have had everything laid on , per my instructions , but he did n't have to go and do it all on his own . " " Jolly decent . I say , I am a wreck , darling . I think I 'll just take my lovely bubbly giggly water and carry it into the bath and make myself all nice and clean and bridy . I can still taste the grit from that ride . You want to drop down to the bar , or what ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I hate champagne  --  and stare into the fire and plot the future . I have n't decided yet on whether it 's to be a boy first or a girl first . Gallop off and get all ruffly like they do in the books . I 'll ring for the supper when you 're sweet and clean . " " Right . ' By . " Elisabeth blew him a kiss and went into the bedroom ,  |p133closing  the door . Jeff walked over to the sideboard , put down his champagne glass , and poured himself a stiff scotch . He squirted in a little fizz , shucked his coat , loosened his tie , and sat down in front of the fire . Funny , he thought , now it 's here , and we 're both scared stiff and want to keep putting it off , like some goody the kids save as best for last . In the morning she 'll wake up in the crook of my arm and grin at me , but right now I 'm as scared as I was when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the day the ship blew . I 'm scared , and yet I ai n't . What I am is lucky , he said , nibbling at the edge of his glass and watching the dancing shadows from the fire . Oh Christ , what a lucky chap I am . The prettiest and smartest girl in Kenya . I lived through the war . I have a farm as fine as any in the country , with no debts . I have n't got any close people at all to mess up the marriage , and her people are all fine . If I were a praying man I 'd pray a little bit here , because no one man deserves all this luck . Heigh-ho , Newton . I 'm not a praying man , so I will just say thanks to whoever runs it and let it go at that . Hrnmm , I hear splashings . I think I shall just whip into the lav and wash my face and then get out of these clothes and into something lascivious , like pajamas , slippers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gown , as a matter of fact , and it 's a crying shame it 's only flannel , fresh off the nail at Ahamed 's . Jeff walked into the bedroom to unpack his pajamas , and through the bathroom door he could hear splashings and singing . The bride , for some peculiar reason , was singing , " Lay that pistol down , babe , lay that pistol down , pistol-packin ' mama , lay that pistol down , " a most unbridifiedsong made recently popular by the Americans . Jeff grinned at the song . " ' D say that the old girl does n't sound unhappy , " he said , and took off his pants . This time , he noticed , he took them to the clothespressand hung them neatly over a hanger . He washed his hands and face and got into his pajamas , slippers , and robe . He got out his toothbrushand cleaned his teeth , dampened his hair , and ran a comb through it . As he started back to the lounge , Lisa called through the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the food now if you 'd like , darling . " Jeff picked up his glass , had a drink out of it , and then punched the button . He heard a door open , a door close , and then the sound of another door . Elisabeth had paused at the bedroom door . Her hair was brushed up and stood in ringlets , springing softly about her luminous face . Her eyes were wide in the special way she had , except now they were twicep134as wide and twice as large as any other eyes in the world , and twice as blue , twice as violet . There was a stiff sort of frilly stand-up collar that framed her face above the fine thin robe she wore , and with the light behind her he could see the soft rounded outline of her body through robe and the gown underneath . Her face seemed tiny , her eyes grew more enormous , her mouth was tremulous and slightly parted . " Here I am , " she said . " Jeff . Oh , Jeff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully planned by Mr. Manson , the manager , was beautiful , but it had been slightly nibbled at by cats . Jeff stepped in the beautiful oysters , the lovely thin-sliced salmon , the delicate aspic , the fine cold fowl , and the wonderful cheese . He stepped in the miraculoussupper the next morning as it rested outside the door , as they left on their way for a month 's honeymoon at Malindi on the coast . The servants had tired of ringing the doorbell and had left the tray on the floor , and the house cats had come and had a fine time with the wedding supper . " I 'm hungry , " Elisabeth said when she woke the next morning . She stretched , and kicked her feet under the covers . Her hair tickled Jeff 's neck as she made herself small and snuggled into his shoulder . " I 'm hungry , and I love my new husband so very , very much . " The last statement removed any remote possibility of breakfast , and so they were forced to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian in the ducca at Fort Hall , on the way down to the coast . The sausage rolls were wonderful , just what they wanted , and the beer was simply divine . They laughed and swam in the opalescent waters at Malindi , and they went spearfishing and sat on the shining sands in the sun and listened to the breezes rattle the palm fronds . They played sand-crab poker and they ate a great deal and took long naps after lunch . They went over to Mombasa , where Jeff knew an Arab dhow captain , and they sailed with him to Zanzibar , sleeping on the carven poop under the brilliant stars , resting on soft high-piled Afghan rugs and listening to the plain/five minor-keyed crooning of the fierce-mustached Arab sailors who lay in the waist of the big dhow , smoking kif and picking icily at queer mandolins or blowing softly into flutes . They walked slowly round the bazaars and inspected the rosy stone buildings of a civilization that went back to A.D. 950 and of which the poets sang . They hooked a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little airplane , and went on the tiles in Nairobi for a week . Then they got into the Chev and drove back to Jeff 's farm . He had a surprise waiting for Elisabeth . It was a complete new wing on the old stone house , melded so carefully into the old structure by Italian prisoners of war that it even seemed aged . It was masoned of yellowstone chopped crumbly from the nearby hills , and formed a careful L away from the old dwelling , with a broad , flagged patio in the hollow space between the old and the new house . The living room was huge , its ceiling sixteen feet , its floor space forty feet by thirty-five . One wall was natural black-and-red stone , and into it was carven a fireplace so large it had stone seats inside . There was a deep bay overlooking the patio , from which already were springing annualand perennial flowers . Great showy blooms of bougainvillaea had been enticed from the old house and were crawling up the walls . Sliding panels , stained gray-green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchenette-pantry at the far end . At the other end , vast french doors let in the sunlight and opened onto a cool green terrace which was rimmed with herbaceous borders and shaded by a towering cedar . The short end of the L consisted of two one-storied bedrooms dividedby an immense bathroom containing tub and shower . The first room held only a tremendous double bed and a chest of drawers flanked by leather chairs . The other room , green-paneled on three sides and white-stoned on one , owned a small fireplace pierced halfway up the wall , a single bed , a big chintzed easy chair , a blond-wood vanity table with triple mirrors , bookshelves , and a yellow Indian chenille carpet . Jeff had stretched a magnificent leopard skin along the wall over the fireplace , its mounted head held in a bracket . On the day they arrived there were yellow roses in a silver bowl , a special assignment Jeff had assigned to Peter before they left on their honeymoon . The big living room contained an old but newly varnished and tuned grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had sat in storage for years in Nairobi . One whole wall was bookshelves . The floor was polished African ebony , actually the black heart of a certain thorn tree . Over the mantel Jeff had hung his best buffalo , a huge beast withp136an enormous boss , mounted so that he looked downward into the room . There was a lion-skin rug on the floor in front of the hearth , and on the two matching cowhide sofas leopard skins sprawled along the backs . There was a huge writing desk in one corner and several deep leather easy chairs scattered around . Jeff 's gun cabinet , as always parenthesized by elephant tusks , stood next the bar , and the oiled guns gleamed through the glass front . Jeff picked up Elisabeth and carried her once again across the threshold . " This is your new home , sweetie , " he said , setting her down with a thump and a misdirected kiss which nearly removed her nose . " I hope you like it . These Italians arc bloody marvelous workers . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it already looks like we 've been living in it . " " I think it is just the most wonderful wedding present anybody ever had , " Elisabeth said . " And you are the most thoughtful man . Becausethis is my house , not my mother 's or your father 's , and it takes a very clever fellow to understand what that means . To come to a place nobody else ever lived in , I mean , her very own place . " " I 'm a bloody genius as well as being a fantastic lover , " Jeff said . " Come on . I 'll show you around , and then we 'll see what the bed 's like . " " I hope this healthy boyish enthusiasm continues to continue , " Elisabeth said . " What 's this other bedroom ? " " That 's your boudoir , silly . Secret female country for when you 're mad at me or want to read old love letters from other men . Also a place to retire to when the boys come home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , about this bed . . . " " Last one in is a nigger baby , " Elisabeth said , unzipping her skirt . Some mornings later Elisabeth poured herself a second cup of coffee at breakfast and announced : " I 'm glad you built us the new house , Jeff . " " Mmmm ? What ? " Jeff turned the pages of a week-old East African Standard . " Long as you 're bent over , pour me another cup as well . What is all this about the new house ? " " It looks very much as if the old one 's going to come in very handy . Unless the signs are all wrong , I think I 'm pregnant , despite my fine precautions . Do you mind dreadfully ? " " Mind ? His name 's Geoffrey , of course . " Jeff lit a cigarette andp137buffed his nails smugly on his sleeve . " Unless it 's twins , in which case we 'll call the other boy Harry , after your old man . " " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so smelly . " " We 'll drown it if it 's a girl , " Jeff said . " Ca n't get a decent bride price for manamouki any more . Nope . Got to be a boy . I went and had e chat with the witch doctor . Boy guaranteed . Boy named Jeff . And why else , my good brood mare , do you think I built this new wing ? I 'd planned on filling up the other one with kids . I 'm pleased to find you so cooperative . Try not to be one of those throwing-up pregnant types , will you ? " Elisabeth turned up the corners of her eyes at him . " Are n't you supposed to do something frightfully tender , like kissing the young mother and falling on your knees at her feet when she announcesa thing of this sort ? " " Kiss ' em ? Not me . If they 'll do it with you , they 'll do it with anybody , " Jeff said coarsely . " None of that silly kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her feet in order to make himself a liar . " As a matter of fact , " he whispered against her mouth , " I did n't really want to do any work this morning , anyhow . " Two months after the marriage of Jeff Newton and Elisabeth McKenzie the trial of Karanja and the two midwives was convened in Nyeri . Karanja was charged with being accessory to murder . The two old women were charged with murder . The trial was pathetically brief . The two old women gave testimony . Yes , they said . A baby , born feet first , was taken from the womb of Mwange , wife of Karanja . Was it a healthy baby ? Yes , Bwana , it was a very healthy baby , a fine big boy . " Then what did you do with the baby ? " the Crown asked . " I bit its navel cord and handed it to Gachere , " Nduta said . " Then I saw to the baby 's mother . " " What did you do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a goatskin , " Gachere said . " Then I wrapped it in the skin and laid it to one side . " " What did you do then ? "  | " I assisted Nduta in seeing to the welfare of the mother . " " Did anyone tell you to kill the baby ? " " Oh no , Bwana . We always kill babies born feet first , because they are cursed with a thahu . " " Do you kill other babies ? " " Ndio , Bwana . We kill first-born twins , always , because they too have thahu . " " What did you do with the baby after the mother was seen to ? " " VVe took it to the fields for the hyenas , as is the custom , Bwana . " " Was the baby quite dead ? When you took it to the hyenas ? " " I think so , Bwana , " Nduta said . " It did not breathe . " " When you take your dead , old and young , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always , Bwana . Sometimes , when an old person is very sick and near death , it is better to take them to the fields before they die . In this way the hut is not contaminated , and so it is not necessary to burn the hut and leave the shamba . " " Do you recognize the fact that killing is against the law ? " " Oh yes , Bwana . Everyone knows that to kill is very bad , except in war , or when a poisoner is discovered , or when an enemy has cursed you . And a blood price must be paid to the relatives of the dead one , which is very expensive , needing many sheep , goats , and cows . Killing is very bad , especially if the slain one be of your own clan . " " Is killing children against the law ? " " Oh yes , Bwana . Nobody would kill a child . Killing a child is much worse than killing an adult , because women children are the riches of their fathers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tribe from harm . " " But killing a baby , a newborn baby ? Is not that killing a child ? " " Oh no , Bwana , " both old women said , horrified . " A child is never officially born until the second year , when it celebrates its birthday . This was no child of whom you speak . This was a demon which had taken the body of the child and , thanks to God , made its presence known by being born upside down . A true child is not a child until it has passed one year . We merely took this demon from the woman and cleansed her of thahu by destroying it . After which we gave it to the hyenas , as is customary . " " Which of you , once more , actually smothered the child ? "  | " I did , " Gachere said . " Because Nduta was very busy with the t her . But do not call it a child . It was a monster . " " If I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monster , " Nduta said . " It is nothing , really , to destroy that kind of thahu . But there was the cord to be cleaned and tucked back and the matter of the afterbirth , and so Gachere smothered the monster . " Will you smother other children when you return to the shamba ? " " Oh yes , certainly , Bwana . It is our duty to smother children who are born wrong-end-to , or who are first-born twins . It is very bad to let them live , because they become monsters in human flesh and give thahu to all with whom they come in touch . " " Holy God , " the Crown said to himself . " And these are the people who will someday govern themselves . " The Crown then summoned Karanja to the stand . Karanja scratched himself . There were lice in the jail . " Did you order the killing of the child ? " the Crown asked . " No , Bwana . The birthing of children is work for women , and the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news comes of whether the child is a boy or a girl and signals are made by cutting the sugar canes , five for a boy , four for a girl , does the father celebrate the birth . There was a thahu on my house , and so when the child was born feet first , in the sign of the demon , the old women naturally smothered the child . It has always been so . " " But you approved of the killing of the child ? " " Of course , Bwana . What else would one do with a demon ? " " All right . Stand down . This honorable court is adjourned . " The black askaris came and took Karanja and the two old women away to the jailhouse . The Crown pulled off his wig and shucked his all . Then he mixed another . " Helen , " the Crown said to his wife , " perhaps you can tell me what I do now . " " You poor , poor man , " his wife said . The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given life imprisonment as an accomplice . Karanja was sentenced to five years in jail as an accessory before the fact . When the sentence had been pronounced the Crown went home and got hopelessly drunk off brandy and wept.  |p140When  Kimani heard the sentence of death for the woman Gachere and the prison terms for Nduta and his father , he could not understand how it could be so . Had he not been purified of the thahu that had entered him as a result of having been struck by the Bwana Jeff ? Had not the mundumugu slain a goat , and had he not worn its entrails and vomited out the curse ? If this were so , then why was his father in jail ? He did n't care about the old women , they were old and would die soon , anyhow , but his father was innocent and it was all his , Kimani 's , fault , and the fault of the Bwana Jeff , who had struck him . He went to the old witch doctor and asked him where the purificationhad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked . " I am cleansed of the thahu , yet my father is in jail . Is your magic no longer strong ? " " My magic is strong enough , " the old man replied . " But the damage had been done before I cleansed you . The white man 's magic is also strong , and he has might on his side , askaris and white officers of Kingi Georgi , soldiers and elders who wear wigs and pass down sentences in the council . I can not help your father more , for the thahu must be yet in your body . " " What can I do further to purify myself , old man ? " " There is nothing further to be done . Unless ... " " Unless what ? " " Nothing . There is nothing more to be done . " The old man took his bean gourd and spilled the beans idly on the ground , piling them in little heaps . He counted the extras and looked up like a wise old monkey at Kimani . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is finished is past . Kwaheri . " Kimani went away in search of Peter McKenzie , his friend . He found Peter lounging on the lawn , resting his elbows on the grass as he talked to his father , who was smoking on the porch . " Excuse me , Bwana , " Kimani said , looking from the boy to the man . " But I am very sad that my father is in jail and that it is my fault thatp141is in jail , because of a thahu that I brought to his shamba . I did notk the thahu . It was the fault of the Bwana Jeff , who struck me . " " Enough of that talk , Kimani . " Henry McKenzie spoke sharply . " It was n't your fault , and it was n't the Bwana Jeff 's fault , either , and this thahu nonsense is just that . You 've been to school and you are a Chrisdan , and you should know better . It was just damned bad luck all round . I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after things quiet down . Be patient , and remember that you are now the head of your father 's house while he is gone . You must be a man , and leave t his to me . Do you understand ? " " I understand , Bwana . May I go occasionally to visit my father in the jail ? To take him beer and snuff and see that he is not treated badly ? " " Of course , boy . You may go when I go , which will be once a week . Your father will be treated well . But you must undertake his duties until his return . There is a sick heifer in pasture , and I wish her to be brought to the barn . She is the big white one with red spots . Go and fetch her now . " Poor little bugger , " Henry McKenzie said as Kimani went away , holding himself stiffly and proudly . " Poor little bugger . Caught halfway between yesterday and tomorrow , and not quite sure of either . Confidentially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karanja paroled to me and at least lighten the sentence on the two old women . Not that they 'll mind being in clink for a bit . The food 's fair and there 's not much work for them to do . Now , back to what you were saying , Peter .... " " It 's just that I do n't want to be a farmer for a while , Pa . You do n't need me on the farm , not with Jeff next door . The war 'll be over one of these days and people will be coming back to Kenya , and I want to be a white hunter . Anyhow , for a few years . It 's not that I do n't like the farm . But it 's your farm , and you 'll run it for a long time . Someday I 'll have to give it all my time , just as you have , but I want to have some fun first . There 's so much I have n't seen . I have n't seen the Congo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't know anything about Tanganyika or Uganda . I want to see the Sudan and Portuguese East . I was talking to old Dan the other day , at the wedding ... " - " Before you got disgracefully drunk and passed out , after being sick in the stream ? " Henry McKenzie grinned . " Or after ? Because if it was after , I doubt you 'll quote him accurately . "  | " I told you I was sorry about that , " Peter said sheepishly . " No , sir , Dan said that when he started hunting again he 'd take me along as his apprentice for a couple of years , and then when he retired I could have his string and strike off on my own . " " Said that , did he ? Must have a fair opinion of you , as he 's the best there is . So you want to be a vagabond , eh ? Ca n't say as I blame you too much , but it 's a lousy life , Peter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to spoil you for settling down ever . I 've seen it happen too often . It 's a false life , full of liquor and awful rich people who see you as a freak and a thrill , like a two-headed lion or something . " " Well , I do n't mean it to be forever , Pa , " Peter said , pulling a blade of grass out of the lawn and chewing on it , kicking his feet slowly up and down . " I 'll probably have to go into the forces for a year or so at least , and when I 'm demobbed I 'd like a few years o ' fun . You never had much fun yourself , not from what you 've told me , and I 'll be a bloody sight better farmer if I get a little curiosity out of my system . I promise , Pa , if you 'll let me run loose for a few years , I 'll come back and settle down the very second you can honestly say you need me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe carefully with tobacco and looked down at his blunt , square-ended fingers with the thick raised ridges of nails . " I suppose I 'll say yes in the end . If I tell you no , then you 'll probablyrun off and do what you want anyhow . I know I would . But it 's not tomorrow and not next week and not even next year . The war is n't over and you have n't done your service yet and a lot of things can happen . Suppose we say that if everything turns out pretty much on schedule , and I do n't get kicked in the head by a horse or something , we 'll give you a shot at what you want if Dan will take you on . That 's for a lot later , of course . Meanwhile you 've not finished school and there 's any amount you do n't know about running a farm . You 're going to be my apprentice until the Army get you . Understand ? " " Yes , sir . Thank you , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'll saddle a horse and nip over to Jeff 's and talk to him a little . He tried to talk me off this before , you know . " " No , I did n't . " Henry McKenzie took off his hat and fanned himself with it . " But I 'm not surprised . Solid type , Jeff . No moonbeams in his head . He tells me , by the by , that he 's going to make a grandfather of mep143and an uncle of you . They did n't waste any time starting a family , did they ? And I 'm damned glad . It 'll be nice to have some young'uns running around , now you 're near grown and wanting to be off on safari with it lot of French counts and American millionaires . " " Well , I 'll see you later , Pa , unless you want to ride over with me ? " Peter got up and brushed the ants off his knees . " No , boy . I want to have a look at that heifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's she 's got is n't catching . See you at suppertime , eh ? " " Yes , Pa . Good-by . " Peter was very happy as he rode his horse over to see Jeff and Elisabeth . Things were working out just dandy , now that Lisa was married off and Pa had a son-in-law to talk farming with and plenty of company in the shape of relatives . He would n't be lonesome living alone , not with the yard full of grandchildren and Jeff and Lisa to ride over for dinner . The old man did n't need any real help on the farm , because it ran like a watch , anyhow , but if there were any emergencies , emergencies that called for a white man 's assistance , why there was Jeff , no distance at all away . " This works out just fine for me , " Peter said to his horse . " Now I can whiz off with old Dan and have some fun hunting . Then , when Pa gets too old to run the shauri , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad of a chance to come back and get married and do the farm . Then I 'll move my wife into the house and become a gentleman and raise hogs and kids . It could n't be better , old boy . Whoa ! " The horse , shying at a fox , danced sideways , snorting in alarm . The horse stepped into a pig hole and lurched nearly to the ground , throwing Peter over his head . Peter got up , swearing but unhurt . The horse was limping badly in his left front foot . Peter looked at the leg . It was already beginning to puff around the pastern . " Damn , " Peter said . " I 'll have to walk him home and do for that leg . Come on , old boy . You 're just bruised a bit . " When Peter returned with the lame horse , his father looked up from a book . " What happened to the horse ? " " Pig hole . Nothing serious . Bit o ' liniment and resell fix it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddles and see to the horse . Kimani come back with the cow yet ? "  | " No , he has n't . If you see him , tell him I meant today , not next week . " " Yes , sir . " Peter walked the horse to the barn , unsaddled him , and led him into a loose-box . He took the leg between his knees and looked at it again . Nothing serious . He smeared it with liniment and wrapped it in a clean white cloth . Then he saddled another horse and rode to the front of the house . " No sign of Kimani and the cow , " he told his father . " Maybe he could n't find her and is still looking . Well , the horse is right . I 'm off . See you later . " He swung the fresh horse into a canter and headed for Jeff 's . Kimani took a spear in case of snakes and went off to look for the spotted heifer . As he walked he brooded . Now his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his father and it was his fault . The thahu was still working or his father would not be in jail , and so it was still his fault . If his father died in jail , then he , Kimani , would have killed his father . But it was n't his fault , really . The real fault lay with the Bwana Jeff , who had hit him and brought the thahu . If the Bwana Jeff had brought the thahu , then the thahu could be lifted only through the Bwana Jeff . The Bwana Jeff had struck him , and he had not struck back , as a man should . He had been insulted , and because of the insult the thahu had come and the baby was born feet first , and even though the baby was killed to remove the thahu , his father was in jail . If there were some way to atone for the insult , some way to retaliate for the slap , then the curse would be gone and his father released from jail . Kimani stopped dead still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand . Suddenly he began to run , leaping high in the grasses , springing like an impala . The spotted cow was forgotten . When Peter walked his horse into Jeff Newton 's yard , he heard a great hubbub of shouted orders from within the house . He threw the reins over the horse 's head and ran into the house . Jeff Newton was lying stretched on the divan . He had his shirt off and held a glass of whisky in his hand . He was very pale . Elisabeth and one of the houseboys were just tightening the bandages that circled his right shoulder . A basin of water , purpled with permanganate , stood on the table.  | " Oh , it 's Peter , " Jeff said , and grinned . " Fine friends you 've got , my lad . Damned near cost you a brother-in-law . " " What happened , for Christ 's sake ? " " I was ambushed . Went back to the barn a few minutes ago to doctor a colt , and as I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hell of a yell and this dirty great spear came whistling and went all the way through my shoulder . A little more center and I 'm dead as bones . As it is , I 'll not be able to use an arm for a month . " " Did you see who it was ? " " No . Catching a spear in your own back yard happens so seldom these days . All I heard was a yelp , and then the spear flew and knocked me down and I heard feet running off into the woods . By the time Elisabeth and the boys heard me yell and came and untransfixed me from the bloody thing , whoever did it would 've been a mile away . " " Where is the spear ? " " I do n't know . Lisa , where 's the spear ? " " On the back porch . It 's still bloody , and I do n't want to see it . " " I do , " Jeff said . " Kaluku ! Go and fetch the spear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , thin blade was blooded nearly to the haft . It had passed all the way through Jeff 's shoulder but had missed bone . Peter took the spear in his hands and balanced it . He looked at Jeff . Jeff nodded . They both knew that when Peter returned home for supper Kimani would not be there , and neither would the spotted cow he had been sent to find . " Police business ? " Peter asked Jeff . " No . Pour me another drink , will you , and one for Elisabeth and yourself . No . There 's been trouble enough . Poor little bastard . I guess he thought that if he killed me the curse would be wiped out and his old man would get out of jail and all would be serene . Thanks for the drink . This shoulder hurts like hell . No . Best just to let him go . He 'll have trouble enough without any more from me . Take the Chev now , will you , Peter , and go and collect the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches . " As Peter drove off to fetch the doctor , he thought : What a pity . Now Kimani will never get to be my gunbearer . And I would have let him shoot the guns once in a while . Maybe even at a lion . I wonder where he 'll go and what he 'll do.  |p146Several  times he saw movement in the bush close to the track , but it was only buck and once a monkey . One thing only lightened his gloom . His pa had said that he could go with old Dan one day and learn to be a white hunter . He would find another gunbearer meanwhile . Maybe someday Kimani would come home.  |p149Peter  McKenzie stood leaning against the bar in the dim cool maltysmellingtaproom of the Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi and flicked his thumbnailtwice against his glass . " I 'll have a martini this time , please , " he said to the steward . He turned toward his companion . " Pimm 's is fine to cut the dust , but I need something a little sturdier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little John ? " " No , thanks , I 'll have a martini too , please . Just what is it you call them ? " " Martini a main mbile . American chap I had out last year thought it up . Seems they have some sort of drink called ' on the rocks ' in the States , when it 's just ice and double booze with no mixing . Martini twice on the mountain ' was as close as we could come to it for Moussa 's benefit . Right , Moussa ? " " Yas , Bwana . That other Bwana , he drinking very much . We call him the Bwana Ginni-Bottle here in the hotel . " Peter McKenzie was standing with John Thompson , another professionalhunter , who had been second hunter with Peter on the safari from which they had just returned . John Thompson was a short , wiry , muscular blond man with bright monkey 's brown eyes and a broken nose . He was Peter 's best friend , and each was happy to defer to the other as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as Number Two to any other hunter . Peter was just twenty-five . He was a big man now , topping six feet . His black hair still curved down over his forehead , and a damp , whitedustylock was visible under his tipped-back hat . His skin was burned so dark from the hot sun of the Northern Frontier that his teeth looked almostgrotesque against his face . He had the strong sloping shoulders of a boxer , running smoothly into a corded column of neck . He was wearing a green short-sleeved bush jacket , faded nearly white , and green shorts . His legs , burned black as his face , were abnormally sturdy , enormouslythewed , with the broad thick bands of the hard walker . Peterp150McKenzie could trot thirty miles a day in the smiting sun after elephants and still have enough gas left to run over a mountain at the end of it . His wrists were nearly as thick as his ankles , and his hands , callused and scarred , were as heavy as flatirons . The black hair of his naked legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his head was stiffly gray with dust and sweat . He and John Thompson had just driven their Land Rovers down from Isiolo , north of Nanyuki and near the Abyssinian border , that day . The clients had stopped on at the Mawingo Hotel in Nanyuki for a few days of relaxation after the hot , dirty hunt . They would come on to Nairobi by car , for the roads were good now and you did n't tear a saloon car to pieces any more . Peter was something of a legend in Nairobi , young as he was . The natives called him Bwana Nyeusi , the Black One . He had been hunting professionally for seven years . He was in the Army only one year before the war ended and he was demobilized . He was just eighteen when he came back to Kenya , having been no farther away from it than Addis Ababa . He had seen no fighting and had gone no higher than lance corporal . He had fussed about the farm and prowled the towns aimlessly for six months but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bored him worse . It was fine seeing the old man again , of course , and wonderful to catch up with Jeff and Elisabeth and the kids , three of them now , two boys and a girl . Jeffy was quite a big boy , must be nine or thereabouts , little Harry fivish , and the baby , Caroline , two and a bit . Quite a family old Jeff had started . Still the best , old Jeff . Quieter and heavier and more serious generally , but still his own man . Marriage had n't tamed him completely , the way it did a lot of people . He still joked Elisabeth , and he teased the kids , and latterly was quite rude about Peter 's Nairobi doings with the girls . One thing about Jeff , though ; he was n't one of these blokes that go whipping off after every skirt they see soon 's the first brat 's toddling and there 's another on the way . He and Elisabeth had a wonderful , quiet , sort of shining happiness with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much , and the extra stone was awfully becoming . She was a strikingly beautiful woman now , where she 'd been all blue eyes and tender smile as a filly . The old man was about the same , a little grayer , a little gruffer , except when he was playing with the grandchildren . He spoiled them rotten , naturally , and they could get round him on anything . But it was marvelous for the old man , with the kids and all . It made it so easy when Peter told his father one day , six months afterp151the war finished , that he thought he 'd be pushing off . The old man grunted . " Going to hold me to that thing about apprenticing to Dan , eh ? " Henry McKenzie said . The old boy had grown stouter and much whiter in the hair ; no doubt of it . " I thought I might . The safaris have started again , now the war 's done . I saw Dan in town the other day and he said he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next couple of years . Masses of people who shot out here before the war with Dan want to come back again . Cinema companies making flicks too . He reckons the next few years ' 1l be bumper in the shootin ' business . Wants me to come along as his mtoto . He says he thinks he 'll quit after two or three years , and then I can have his boys . It 's a good string . " " What 's he paying you ? " " Bloody nothing . Twenty quid a month and my chakula . I 'm to furnish my own guns , of course . He wants me to drive the lorry and look after the camp and do the mechanics and sort of flunky about for a while , and he 'll teach me most of the tricks . Then I can go as his second hunter for a year or so , and then he reckons to quit and turn the whole show over to me . I want to do it , Pa , really . You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right if I go ? " " I suppose so , you 're mad keen to do it , and always were , ever since you were a nipper . You 'll need guns . I never use mine on anything any more , bar the odd buck for the pot . You can have the .470s and the .416s . Leave me the old .500s ; I 'm sentimental about them . Leave me the Mannlicher , as well , and one set of shotguns . Take the Remington . It 's a useful little gun , and you might 's well have the .318 . You can damned well buy your own .22 . I consider I 've given you a hell of a good start . That 's about two thousand quids ' worth of artillery I 'm doweringyou with . Go on now and be a Nairobi attraction for all the tourists to point at in the bars . Grow a beard and maybe you can go on the films . I should listen carefully to Dan if I were you . He knows more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to getting yourself killed . You do n't build good hunters in a day or a year . I used to do the elephants myself , and I know . " Peter took the oily-gleaming guns out of the cabinet and Jeff drove him to town to pick up old Dan , and that was the start of it . Dan was the opposite of the cinema idea of the white hunter . He was fat and stubby-legged . He had a round , pink cherub 's face , a tiny button nose ,  |p152white  hair , and a clipped white mustache . He was a great believer in the therapeutic qualities of gin , and he hated hard work . He was custodianof a thousand changeable stories , some hair-raising , some rude , some self-deprecating . He also had a reputation , forged between the two last wars , for being a dashing man with the ladies . There was at least one loud divorce in Europe which resulted from his presence in the bed of a viscountess while the viscount was out after waterbuck with the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he had sprouted them on his own head when he returned a mite early to camp . He 'd been frightfully civil about things , though , and merely ceased speaking to either Dan or the viscountess for the rest of the hunt . Dan worked especially hard to produce spectacular trophies and dined alone in his tent . He heard later from London that the viscount had hung a portrait of his wife between the mounted heads of a wart hog and a wildebeest , possibly the two ugliest animals in the world . Safari was devilish hard work at first . Peter never got to fire a gun seriously for a year , except once in a while when they needed camp meat and he had to go out and wallop the odd topi or eland for the pot . It was dirty , backbreaking toil . Peter 's job was to supervise the loading and off-loading of the lorries , ruling a mountain of canvas tentage , water distillers , heavy wooden chop boxes , chairs , tables , kitchen utensils , food , drink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honeymoon couple , they had strapped an enormous great brass double bed , with its feather mattress , on top of the lorry-load . Peter 's chief task was to see to the provisioning of the safari . Peter 's job also was to go to the airport to meet the clients , to steer them through customs , and to see them safely bedded down in the Norfolk . It was Peter who took them to Ahamed 's and to the Africa Boot Shop to outfit them . Peter was the one who got up before dawn to round up the last of the sleepy , hung-over , elusive blacks , and he came to know the native bazaars as well as Delamere Avenue . He knew every whorehouse , teashop , and drinking saloon that catered to Africans , as he eventuallycame to know the trails that led from the N.F.D. to the Masai , across the Serengeti and back again to Manyara , up to Iringa and back to Arusha , down to Tabora and deeper down to the Sudan . Peter drove the lorry and pitched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect the white memsaabs from snakes while the Bwana went off to shoot lions with old Dan . In these stay-behind sessions Peter learned a great many things . He learned contract bridgep153and canasta and that a great many ladies came on safari to collect certain Wophies of their own special choosing . He lost his virginity at nineteen , when quite a lovely lady came to his tent one day after lunch as he lay Diked in siesta . She dropped her robe in a pool at her feet . Quite as Daked as he , she hopped into bed with him and there really was n't very much that a bloke could do except submit  --  was there ? Peter accumulated sophistication . He learned the wisdom of trying to avoid the tentative advances of the female guests , at least while the safari was in the field , because sexual tension made extra complications . But there were some , nymphomaniac and otherwise , who could not be put off . Peter was young and handsome and healthy and he was alone very often with the wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-faced and beefy or skinny and paunched and spindly , who came to collect dead heads to put on their country-house walls . In his first year of working for Dan , Peter learned considerably more about women and whisky than he learned of wild animals and their habits . I le diminished his shyness gradually and became quite a slick conversationalist . One pretty young wife of a very old , very rich Texas oilman , taught him to do the rumba and the fox trot to the tune of a portable phonograph hitched to the battery of the lorry . Then she taught him quite a few other social niceties without needing any more electric power than she herself could generate on a cold , bright-starred night in the high Masai , when Dan and her husband had gone off to Kandoa Arangi to shoot kudus and had left the little lady in Peter 's special care . By the time he was twenty Peter had come to a single conclusion about women , particularly those who were left in his special care . Peter actually got very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lorry , he had to keep her fit , and he had to be mechanic to the shooting rigs as well . When they were hunting hard , in rocky country , one of the vehicles was always ailing , and Peter would be up to the dawn , his ears greasy , as he replaced broken spring leaves or soldered a sundered sump or rejiggered a bearing assembly . Crossing the plains in the wet , the lorry was always certain to bog down in the soft cotton soil , and Peter remembered one day when they had made fourteen trips of two miles each , each man carrying some heavy article of the foundered lorry 's burden on his head to a point of high , hard ground . Peter walked twenty-eight miles that day , with tables and tents on his head , while old Dan lounged in the shade in a canvas camp chair , drinking gin and telling tall tales to the clients.  |p154Drinking  was important , old Dan always said . A bloke had to drink with the clients , else they 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire with the stars frosty in the sky and the mosquitoes swiftly gone in the sudden cold was one of the finest things about safari . That was the time when you reviewed the doings of the day or the week , the client either bragging or apologizing , and the hunter embroideringthe brags and scoffing at the apologies . That was when the boys laughed and sang by their cook fires and thumped drums softly and the hyenas giggled and the lions roared and the advertised glamor of safari emerged to make you forget the dust and the bugs and the heat and the thorns and the snakes . There was nothing so important as keeping plenty of booze in the camp , Dan said , plenty of beer and soft drinks as well , and keeping the drink cool in the water bags , because when a client came in from a morning in the blazing sun , dust in all his pores and gritting in his teeth , what he wanted most was a beer straight off and then a long cool gin and lime . And at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the last bumpy mile on the track took a hundred years , what the client wanted first of all was a stout scotch or a muscular martini before the boys brought his bathi water in the petrol tins , where they 'd been heating over the fire . And the client wanted you to drink with him , to erase the guilty feeling of drinking alone or of drinking too much . He wanted you to drink to celebrate a wonderful shot on a fine head that day , or else he wanted to drink to dull his pain over missing something so easy that he might have killed it with a slingshot . No matter what there was to celebrate , it had to be solemnized with a drink of anything except water . It was especially sticky going in town , because when the client first showed up he was all excited about taking off for the trackless wastes of darkest Affrikka and he was tired from the plane trip , so he wanted to sit and drink to mask his fear and to camouflage his ignorance while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the town and he wanted the town to see him , brave in his new bush jacket with the bullet loops . He wanted to be introduced to the game warden and to everybody else as Dan 's newest client . He wanted to go dancing at the Equator Club and the Travellers ' and the Chez Dave . Then he wanted a last swift one for the road , and maybe let 's just stop off at Fort Hall or Narok for a beer , shall we ? When it was all over you all were dear old buddies , and you reallyp155come see us in the States or in Madrid or Canada or wherever. you must have dinner with us tonight , let 's make it a party , howt asking a couple of those cute little air hostesses to come along ? Andyou would end up singing in one of the back-court cottages at the Norfolk , with the women sweetly drunk and soggy-sentimental and the client 's bored wife maybe making a pass at a navigator or one of the pilots , and the client alcoholically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over the hunter and paying no attention to the client . Then there was the **29;9027;TOOLONG kind of drinking , and the **37;9058;TOOLONG drinking , and **45;9097;TOOLONG drinking , and all the **35;9144;TOOLONG ordinary drinking , and finally the serious good-by drinking . Then , if you were a very good hunter , the day you pushed one group off at Eastleigh Airport you had a drink in the bar while you waited for a new group to come in the same day , and the boozing started all over again . The toughest thing about the drinking was that you were supposed to be completely efficient and brightly alert despite it . The trophies had to be found and stalked and killed and skinned . If the client wounded it you went after it to finish it . If the lorry broke down you fixed it . If the game was n't there you went someplace else until you found it . If the grass was tall you went to where the grass was supposed to be short . You were hired to sit up all night drinking whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded buffalo in the morning . You were never supposed to get lost or be tired or cross or disgusted . Yes , Peter had learned a lot from his apprenticeship to old Dan . Over the two years of apprenticeship they had had a lot of peculiar clients . There was the queer Englishman who insisted on sleeping in trees , so they had to build him a platform in a tree in every camp and hoist a bedroll up into it . He swam naked in every stream they came to , against all warnings , and bought a thriving case of bilharzia as a result . But he was a jolly good chap and he did n't like to kill things . He putteredwith cameras and seemed sincerely fond of lions . Oddly , or rather stupidly , he was completely fearless . He seemed to think that he was living in a large , controlled , airy zoo . When he left the safari he gave Peter a very fine cine camera and all the raw film that was left over from the expedition . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Duchess of Den-P156ton , who cursed like a man and smoked cigars and who had one aim on the safari , which was to eavesdrop lions and elephants and giraffes , especiallygiraffes , making love . Dan hunted hard , and while they never caught any elephants copulating , they did manage to sneak up on some lions and giraffes . The giraffes were fantastic , all planes and right angles . There was the pansy chap , a lawyer from Los Angeles , who tried to do all the black boys . Peter caught him with one of the porters , who seemed to think that there was nothing very unusual about it . Peter beat the porter with a kiboko and sacked him , and Dan drove the pansy chap back to Nairobi and refused any payment for the safari . Funny , the types who came to Africa to keep doing whatever it was they had always been doing in the States or in England or wherever . Peter first learned about lesbians on safari . One , the male part of the show , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip every day and who called herself Bill , though her name was Helen . She had a curious rubber contrivance with her . She kept it in a box and made great secret jokes about it with her girl friend . They called the contrivance Lord Derek , and they used to chuckle when they took it out of the box to " give Lord Derek a breath of fresh air . " Bill , or Helen , was very jealous of her girl friend , a wispy little thing with enormoussad brown eyes and a weak , petulant mouth . The girl friend made a few tentative motions toward Peter and excited a great deal of jealousy in Bill . The jealousy got so bad that although , God knows , Peter felt nothing but loathing for the girl friend and tried to avoid her , the safari ended in utter disaster , with Dan and Peter eating apart from the women and speaking only in monosyllables when an order to the clients was necessary . God , but some of them were funny . There was the Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hunt , and then refused to hunt . He stayed in camp all day long , drinking gin and talking Seri ously to the baboons who came curiously to visit him . There was the Cambodian prince , a decent little brown fellow , who had a big blond music-hall-type Englishwoman with him , who did n't want to hunt or take pictures or even look at game . What he liked to do was to stay in camp in his tent with the Englishwoman . They made some very peculiar sounds in the tent . There was the rich spoiled son of a wood-pulp merchant who started the safari with one wife and finished it with another , puzzlingp157the native boys no end . Then there was the cold murderer , who would ask each morning , " How many of what can I shoot today ? " This was a Mexican . He shot from the car , over Dan 's strong objection . He killedand cubs and he overshot his license . Once he sloppily wounded a leopard and  --  Peter could swear to this  --  old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Dan terminated the leopard before Dan took this safari back to Nairobi , and Dan turned the Mexican in the game warden . He was bowed out of Kenya and forbidden a retrypermit . The types , my word , what types . There was the American femalestar who sun-bathed naked in front of the blacks , causing no enddamage to discipline . There was the big , hairy-chested American hero of a hundred motion picture thrillers who was hysterically afraid of everything mice , bugs , snakes , even the dark . What made it funnier was that they were doing a movie in which the star-bloke played a professional hunter . He and Peter were of about the same size and coloring , so on this one safari Peter found himself to be an actor . He doubled for the actor chap in every scene that needed any contact with animals . The actor won an award that year , possibly for bravery . There was the rich Michigan manufacturer who ordered Dan to shoot it all and then blandly described how he had shot it all himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home , but to sit on the veranda at the Norfolk , in Nairobi , with Peter and Dan present while he described his imaginary feats of bravery , was just a touch too thick . Especially the part in which the rich man told how he had plunged Into the bush after the wounded buffalo  --  which , as he pointed out , Dan had wounded . In this instance he was correct , for Dan had shot It a touch low and had had to dive into the bush after it . The only detail the rich man omitted was that he happened to be reading a detectivestory in camp , twenty miles away , at the time that Dan dived into the bush . But they were n't all so bad . There were a couple of chaps who really wanted to know about it and understand it . When they shot it they only shot what was good and they made no show over the killing . They did ; i11 their shooting themselves and asked a thousand questions , and neither patronized nor attempted socially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to relax , but they were out of the bed stonesoberbefore the dawn started to blood-streak the skies . They walked hardp158in the heat and accepted the tsetse bites and the fine dust settled in the water bag and were very serious about the right bullet weights and the habits of elephants . In two years there were only two of this kind , both young , both rich , and both married to women who seemed to enjoy being married to their husbands . But they were rare , my oath , but they were very bloody rare . Peter acquired a full professional status earlier than he had ever expected . Old Dan bought a nasty bit o ' work with two rhinos one day , a dirty silly accident . He and some client were creeping after buffalo , and they crept right up on top of a breeding pair of rhinoceroses . They were crawling down an old game trail , through the laced thorn , and there was n't room enough in the trail for two men and two rhinos . Dan and the client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the cow came on wounded and fell on Dan . She broke his leg badly in two places , and the old bones were n't quite up to knitting . He was in bed a year , nearly , and while he recuperated , Peter carried on with the already booked clients . At the end of the year Dan tested his leg sadly and concluded that he was finished hunting . He was too slow and tenderbonedto compete in any more foot races with elephant and buffalo . He turned over his string of fifteen Wakamba boys to Peter and sold him the lorry , the tents , and the hunting car on time payments , and retired to be bored on his farm at Nanyuki . Peter was in business himself at twenty . Peter came on as a personality very swiftly . Dan had tested him on clients , and he was forced to test himself on game . A lot of it he knew ; some from Jeff , some from his father , some he knew without knowingthat he knew . He was touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a madness to learn and see and discover . His lips curved down in scorn at the idea of hunting anywhere that other men hunted if he could possibly avoid it . Mostly he coldly disliked his clients  --  fat , soft men , or complaining thin men , or fat-or-thin men who liked to kill for no reason but to see death . Nevertheless , he drove himself furiously for those he hated most . He had his secret pockets of game  --  a pocket near Ikorna in Tanganyika , a wealth of elephant country up on the dry river beds of the Abyssinian frontier , and a certain-sure source of big kudus away past Iringa in Tanganyika . He could produce a lion when there really were no lions to be produced , and the ivory he brought in was always heavy . And when he was angry , when he was offended , he punished himself , driving day and night , scourging himself , speaking seldom , an/grily seeking a hunter 's justification of indefinable prowess for the benefitof strange men he scorned . Peter cherished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he caused to be killed while despising the humans who killed them . He permitted no abuse of the beasts . He was of course an honorary game warden and bound to report game-law violations , but his feelings passed beyond technicalities . He owned certain pets here and there ; a fine bull elephant that he would not allow to be shot and around which he carefullysteered his clients . He was saving this elephant against a day when some client yet unknown would prove to be worthy of shooting it  --  saving the elephant as he saved a certain black-maned lion , a certain fantastically horned buffalo , a certain wondrous waterbuck . He had no desire whatsoever to kill anything for himself as a trophy . When he shot camp meat he never made any sport of it but rode up in his Land Rover to the nearest herd of Tommies or impalas or topi , crooked one knee against the windscreen , and walloped it illegally from the car without trying to dignify it with a stalk . At the same time he would permit no dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how insistent the client might be . Peter was in love with Africa and with the animals he saw , the animals which he sought for other men to kill . He fidgeted in Nairobi after a day or two of wenching and heavy drinking . He did not feel completely happy until he was back again in the Rover , his hatbrim backcurled in the stiff breeze , and the dust of the Ngong Range puffing pink behind him , with the great blue scar of the Rift beckoning him past Longonot and turning him up toward the high green hills he loved in the Masai . Or maybe when he crawled past the red clay hills and wet green Kikuyu shambas past Fort Hall and Nyeri and on through Nanyuki for the long , short ride to Isiolo , where , apt as not , you would be likely to see a herd of strolling elephants in the D.C. 's boma . The Northern Frontier , past Isiolo , was Peter 's very special country . He began to breathe more deeply when he passed Archer 's Post , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming pool , and he was wildly happy when he turned off to camp at the Kinya lugger . With the lovely , square-headed old mountain , Ololokwe , bulking huge on his left , he could curve the jeep around and aim for the dry rivers , the luggers , that swept new channels for themselveseach year as the floods came flashing down , drowning the **25;9181;TOOLONG in muddy torrents so violent that they slung hugep160trees twenty and thirty feet above the river beds and caused the D.C. to put up barriers on the Garba Tulla  --  Shaffa Dikka road to keep all men out , and in , for the period of the rains . This was where the hard true life of Africa centered , here on the dry , lava-dusty plains or ocher-wet pits , with the huge knobs of **30;9208;TOOLONG strewed aimlessly around with no regard for symmetry . Here on the gray , lonesome , heat-shimmering plains with their myrrh and sansevieria bushes , the wild Boran and the painted Samburu and Rendille and the slim , beautiful light Somali roved with their herds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Turkana , fierce little black men who went about naked and who wore curved knives as wristlets and who would as soon chop your head as thank you if a question of pride was involved . Here it was big enough  --  big enough for the elephants and the rhinos and the little lesser kudus and the leopards and the lean , maneless desert lions . Here it was big enough for the nomads to drift their cattle over a million square miles of territory that nobody but Peter and God and the elephants really loved . This was the land of the sand grouse pinpricked against a clear well-washed blue sky , whistling as they came to scanty water in the morning . This was where the heat trembled at one hundred twenty degrees at 4 P.M. , but where you did n't find any mosquitoes and not many tsetses . This was where the dry river beds were highways of sparkling white sand , islanded with rocks and little green-lichened pools , and where a constant traffic of life surged fretfully in a search for the water that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter could see , in a strip of ten miles , thirty elephants digging earnestly with their tusks for the water that seeped foully under the sandy surface . He could count a dozen rhinos on any morning and follow their trails across a hard-baked plain to the start of their daily twenty-mile walk for water . Why they never stayed on the luggers Peter nor anyone else , not even the Turkana , could explain . But you could spoor them simply by riding along in a jeep , following a big bull by the serpentine bicycle track his penis made as it trailed the ground when the breeding season was on . This was the country in which the dry river beds were thickly cobbled with the dung of a million animals when it was dry outside on the plains  --  the sign of cattle and goats , elephants and rhinos and zebras and giraffes and Grant gazelles . The dazzling white sand was a parade ground for the vulturine guinea fowl who ran with their cockadedheads held high like trotting horses , and where the big , yellow/necked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were always more birds in the Northern Frontier than anywhere else , great hornbills and long , sag-tailed lories , many vultures and slipping carrion kites . The birds kept up an incessant scream , the guineas hoarse , the lories going " Faa-aak , faa-aak , " the francolin mournful at nightfall , and always the pleasant good-humored chuckle of the sand grouse as they carved jet-plane arcs in the brilliant blue sky . With the exception of the nomads , you did n't run across many people in the Northern Frontier . It was all too big and it was always either too wet or too dry . If you knew the way the luggers interlocked , doubling back on themselves , you had a wondrous source of heavy ivory , but a man who did n't know the luggers could get himself lost and die very painfully in the N.F.D. Not many safaris came up this way , because the weather was too unpleasant and the angry red clay pits and dreary gray plains were not picturesque enough for a man who had only six weeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't nearly so high in the horn as the rhinos around Manyara in Tanganyika , at the mouth of Mto-Wa-Mbu , the Mosquito River , not half so long-horned as the forest rhinos who grazed on the slopes of Mount Kenya and in the Aberdares around Nanyuki and Thomson 's Falls . Beyond the birds and a few Grant gazelles and gerenuk there was n't much to shoot except the elephants . That is chiefly why Peter loved it so , because there was n't much to shoot besides the elephants . Most clients did n't want elephants unless they were true hunters who were willing to walk twenty or thirty miles a day through the sucking sands and through the dwarf palms that slashed like swords and the thornbush that clutched and bit at the body . The immensity of the North Country did something lovely and lilting to Peter 's heart . Its very barrenness was beautiful , and its sere heat was happy , healthy . Of all the natives he knew , Peter loved the painted , Masai-like Samburu who roamed with their herds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He actively hated the Somali , but he loved them just to look at the arrogance of them . The women were so lovely with their huge iridescent headdresses , their wonderful small , proudly tilted bosoms and tiny waists and big swaying behinds . And the men so lean , so delicately hawk-faced , and completely treacherousand deadly fast with a knife . They would steal anything , and they worshiped their herds of camels . But they were all part of the North , like its overwhelming nights , when the sky actually took the texture of furry velvet and the stars swung low and melon-golden , not so remotep162and silvery-twinkly as they were up in the Masai , when the evening cold set in . Of course a man could love the Masai too , because around the Mara River and the Telek River , up from the Loita Plains , there was country to make your mouth water at its deep-loamed richness . This was all Masai reserve , thank God , and buzzing-full of cattle-killing tsetse flies , so that the people and cattle stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into wheat and cattle , after clearing the harsh thorn that housed and nourished the flies , would own a swift agricultural bonanza unchallenged by the discovery of later gold . This was n't angry , frightening country like the N.F.D. , but soft and beautiful country , once you got away from the alkali dust and the winddreary , sere lava plains . This was Hollywood Africa , with rolling downs , now of the softest gentle green , against the background of deep black lofty forest , or long plains rolling yellow-grassed and heavy-headed in the pleasant wind like the ripple of wheat . This country had the pure cold streams , and the hot-water springs around Majimoto , and the wonderfulgraduated mountains , with Tanganyika off that way and the Rift 's scar burning blue behind . And all , all the animals that God put into the world were on parade . Here in the Masai was where you could see a half million zebras in a day , a half million wildebeests , when the great migrations started across the Serengeti Plain of Tanganyika . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred along the Telek River , its bed brilliant white and green rock-studded . Here a herd of two hundred elephants unafraid . Here the Tommies roved the plains in bands of thousands , and here the protected prides of lions grew as large as twenty or thirty to one family . This was where the very big heavy-bossed buffalo lived , and where the dark-gold leopards fed nightly by the riverbanks . This was where you could see a million beasts any day , Tommy , Grant , eland , impala , zebra , wildebeest , all moving out into the center of the plain before the dark-red sunset , moving outward against the menace of the big cats who waited for the violent bloody sunset to die before they nervously whipped their tails , stretched lazily after their siesta , and began to search for the evening 's meal . This was the place where the long-dipping glades were green as in England , and where the acacia flowered in the spring with blossoms as white and fragrant as any English May haw or the dogwood in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its natives werep163the fiercest and its animals the most numerous . It was a country for women and children and small , awkward , wet baby animals with knobbly knees and unsteady feet . It was not so big and raw and tough and fiercely beautiful as the N.F.D. It was candybox country , created specially for tourists and the movie-making safaris . When Peter was really fed up with clients he and John Thompson would take a Land Rover and a cook and a gunbearer apiece , and they would trek up to the North Country to shoot out their license on big elephants . They would sleep under the intimate stars on doubled blankets without bothering about beds , eating what they killed of birds and small game , drinking nothing , and by and by the foul taste of movie stars and rich , spoiled women and old frightened fat men would come cleanly spat from their mouths , and then they could face another season of commercial safari again . Fred Hall walked into the bar and joined Peter and John Thompson . Fred was a hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other involving a recently divorced maharajah and a French female singer . Fred was a lean , rangy , ugly man who rarely spoke much , except to close friends , when he was drunk , and who was accounted dull therefore . But he was a pure hunter in his heart , and he completed a close corporation with Peter McKenzie and John Thompson . " Bad , was it ? " Fred said . " I 'll have the same as you . What did they do especially awful this time ? " " I do n't suppose it was actually any more awful than usual , " Peter said . " There was this proven son of a bitch and his son . The son was quite a decent chap . But the old man wanted it all , as usual , and in thirty days . You know . Do n't care whether it 's any good or not so long as it 's dead . So the Little Bwana here and I proceeded to toil , and we collected it all . Two elephants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kudus , two buffalo , two leopards  --  the whole bloody issue . I dragged his arse from the Masai to Tanganyika and back up to the N.F.D. It was amusing , actually , especially in the North . There are ways of saving steps , but I did n't bother to save him any . John and I left them in thep164hotel at Nanyuki . The father already drunk . I have heard a lot of filthy tongues in my short time , but this man was downright horrid . He treated John and me like we were niggers and he treated the Wogs worse . And do you know , after he shot some mangy old lion or other , he insisted on having the lion 's balls broiled for his breakfast ? " " Were you still drinking their whisky ? " Fred asked , using the classic phrase . " I was . The Bwana John was n't . Tell him , boy . " " It was first when this visiting gentleman shot the baby zebra , " John Thompson said . " Long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor little creature for a bait for some vulture photography he wanted . The birds came down and the hero got sick when the ndege started to poke into the carcass up the rear end the way they do . He 'll kill it , sure , but he threw up when he saw what happened to it after it 's dead . But it was the lion that did it for me , really . " " Another gin for everybody , Moussa . Lion ? " " An old boy , Really old . We were rattling around in Ikoma and we came onto this old gentleman , see , sick he was and starved and mangy , with his back broken in some recent fight with one of his sons . I judge the old chap 'd been helpless there the best part of a week . The maggots had already started on him , and the blowflies were working , and hg was skin and bones and really miserable . There were about a dozen hyenas circled round the old chap , their tongues hanging out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they closed in and et him alive . I walked up to the poor old bugger with the .22 and was going to give him the one in the ear to put him out of his troubles , when this four-starred nobleman told me not to shoot . Seems he wanted to leave the beast there alive to see how long it would take for the hyenas to eat him . " " So old John shot the lion , naturally , " Peter said . " Then he called his client a dirty murdering swine and drank his own grog for the rest of the trip . Oh , it was a charmer , I can tell you . This father chap , at the Greek hotel in Arusha , tried to pinch some young girl off his own son . The girl set up a mightiful scream and the old man took a clout at his boy in the argument , and it was an altogether bloody delightful business . I think I shall get very drunk tonight and behave abominably . John and I 've earned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heroes coming in tomorrow . Man and his wife . Young Americans named Deane . His fatherused to manufacture something or other in Chicago or Detroit or one of those places . "   " Maybe they 'll turn out reasonably human . The good ones usually follow the bad . " " Say , has the plane come in yet ? " Peter asked . " It ought to be Betty 's turn to be back from Rome . I could use a little female companionship . Let 's walk down to the hostesses ' hut and see what Trans Africa Airlines has brought us as a present . As I was saying , I feel like a long , dirty wet evening , and preferably one with a woman mixed up in it somewhere . " " We 'll have the road one , " Fred Hall said . " Then I 've got to nip off . My girl 's waiting for me this hour well past at the Stanley , and she 'll be in a frightful fit of temper . My shout , men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounced . Let 's go and scout the livestock , John . " " Right . I hope there 's a short one . I am very shy around tall women . " There was a short curvy one named Dottie and a tall lean-legged bosomy one named Betty . Dottie was blond and Betty was brunette . They were just coming out of the hostesses ' hut when John and Peter swung through the back courtyard of the Norfolk Hotel , a cobbled arena ringed by cottages . The Norfolk was what might be called an earthy hotel . Its history went back to the old hairy tough days of Kenya , when Lord Delamere wore his blond locks long , as in the pictures of General Custer , and if a bit of a fight brewed in the bar the boys were apt to settle it straight off with knives or pistols , bang on the veranda or in the court . " Well , the heroes have returned , " Betty said . " I believe that we might get fed tonight after all , Dot . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rich , " Peter said , walking over and kissing Betty . " Come and have a spot in the cottage whilst John and I remove the topsoil . We just crept in from the N.F.D. " " How was the safari ? " " Bloody . How was the flight ? " " Bloody . Everybody sick all over everything , and the most monstrous child I ever saw . Betty took her into the ladies ' loo and walloped her bottom . She came out screeching , and this one told her mother that she 's fallen off the seat and hurt herself . I think I may get married , if only to get away from child passengers . And away from Paul Steenkamp . Anybody here want to marry me ? " They swung off to Peter 's cottage . " Paul still drinking as beautifully as ever ? " " Absobloodylutely . You should have seen him in Rome . A treat , he was . Got in some sort of argument with a Yankee . Informed the YankeeP166he was not only the chief pilot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion of South Africa as well . The Yankee said : I do n't give a bugger if you 're bloody Joe Louis , ' and downed him . We had a very careful flight next day , due to Paul not being able to see out of more than one eye at a time . " Kamachi was waiting at the door of the cottage . Kamachi was always waiting when Peter came back from safari . He was a big native , an Embu , handsome and purple-black and vastly smiling under his red fez . His big splayed feet were bare under his white kanzu , and he shook Peter 's hand in the old classic fashion , seizing him by the thumb and then changing the grip . " Jambo , you great thief , " Peter said . " How are all your whorehouses ? Making money ? And where are my clothes ? The ones you 're not wearing , I mean , or have n't sold in the bazaar . " " All here , Bwana , " Kamachi said , wriggling like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Villi-villi barafu . Na whisky na soda . Na majimoto . Na manamouki , villi-villi . " " Seems we 're clued up , " Peter said . " But he 's already taking credit for providing the girls , as well . You 'd best watch your step . This Wog has many enterprises . Let 's go and sample the gin and the ice he 's so proud of , whilst John and I bathe in the hot water he 's so proud of . Kwenda , you hyena , and make us some drinks . " " Ndio , Bwana , " Kamachi said , making his assent sound like a roll of drums . " I already made them , and your bath is already drawn and your clothes laid out . I knew you were coming in today . Bwana Johnston told me . Chalo has put your guns inside , and your box . " Chalo was Peter 's gunbearer and general Number One . He was waiting by the Land Rover parked in front of the tiny veranda of Peter 's cottage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some forty years , with filed teeth and enormous holes in his ear lobes . He had tucked the pierced lobes over the top of the ears , giving a strange malproportionto his head . " All is inside , Bwana , " Chalo said . " The guns are clean and I have given your dirty clothes to this Embu baboon to wash . I have counted your suits from the storeroom , and it appears that this thief has stolen nothing in your absence . The whisky is also counted and the tally is correct . You need a new pair of boots , and I have placed the order at the Africa Boot Shop with the little nice Indian who has the wart hog 's teeth . "   " Good man . Here 's a pound . Go and see your wives and try to sober up enough to return from Machakos in three days . We must go again to the Masai . Kwaheri , Chalo . " " Kwaheri , Bwana , " the gunbearer said , tucking the money into his tattered khaki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very careful of the pombe and more careful of the manamouki . " " Mind your own bloody business , " Peter said , smacking him on the seat of the ragged pants . " I 'll look after my own women and whisky , and see you do the same . If you see the Bwana Percival , say him a hello for me . The cottage was standard for the Norfolk . The girls sat down on the one uncomfortable divan , and Kamachi served drinks , whisky for the women and gin for the men . There were two other chairs and a small deal table and insufficient ash trays in the sitting room . There were two bedrooms and a bath-and-washbowl apart from the toilet . The rooms were dingy but cheerful in a sort of happy , battered way , as if a great many parties had been given there , and the memory of too much drink and too much illicit love had lingered . The guns in their cases were stacked in one corner . The metal ammunition box was placed atop the tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked into a cone , like an Egyptian 's sagging pants , in the bedrooms , and Peter 's city clothes were freshly pressed and hung in a closet . The remaining whisky from the safari was grouped companionably like sailors in a corner , with the exception of the opened John Haig and the Booth 's gin on the table . " I 'm going to take this gin into the bathroom and clean myself , " Peter said . " Big John , you look after the ndeges , and see that you load their glasses . They 've got a long way to go to catch us . And when I scream , one of you girls is to come and scrub my back . It 's been a long time since I felt a cool white hand . " By the time Peter and John had shaved and the business of the back-scrubbing was accomplished with a great deal of giggling , all four young people were quite drunk and very hungry . The Equator Club seemed indicated , but somehow they stopped off first at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered he had to see Sid at the Travellers ' about something or other and that took time , and then when they actually got to the Equator Club all the tables were taken , so they stood at the bar and that took time . They went back to the Travellers ' and there were some people there who wanted to buy drinksp168and that took time . About a A.M. , after John had thoroughly peeled a South African transient gentleman for some fancied insult and Peter had nearly obliterated two of the South African gentleman 's friends and somebody had thoughtfully fired a rifle out the window and the police had come and some strange lady had said something unpleasant to either Betty or Dottie and had had her hair pulled and the best part of her blouse removed , they arrived , still dinnerless , at the cottage at the Norfolk . This demanded a nightcap and quite a lot of singing , during which the night manager came around and had a shoe hurled at him and went off to fetch the manager , who received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings at each other , momentarily forgetting that they were n't somebody else , and then fell into each other 's arms , sobbing eternal friendship . This called for another drink . Peter woke early in the forenoon with a taste of formaldehyde in his mouth , a shattering pain in his skull , and eyes from which his lifebloodappeared to be slowly dripping . He had removed everything but his shoes and his necktie , and was never quite certain how he got his shirt off without removing the necktie . Betty , wearing a brassiere , a pettiskirt , one shoe , and Peter 's hat , out of some ineffectual groping for decency , was asleep beside him , but wrong-end-to , so that her unshod foot rested across his face . He pushed her onto the floor with a thump and went to look for John , who had achieved an incredible position , with his head on the floor and his knees hooked over the back of the sofa . Dorothy , fully clad except for a skirt , was sleeping soundly in the bathtub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as anybody was able to recall , nothing very romantic had happened to anybody . " Next time maybe you 'll feed us , " Betty said as she came out of the bathroom and peered out the cottage door to see if there was a chance of sneaking unseen to the hostesses ' cottage . " God , and to think we 've got to fly this afternoon . I 'm going back to the cottage , with or without witnesses . Will you drive us out to Eastleigh , Peter , after lunch ? " " Sure , if I live , " Peter said . " But I can not live any longer without a cold beer . See you at the bar in half an hour and we 'll have a bite of lunch , eh ? Then I 'll take you out to the drome . I 've got to pick up some clients . "  |p169There  are very few finer places in the world than the veranda of the Norfolk Hotel on a bright Kenya morning , with the clouds sailing lazily past , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sucu , the African gray parrot , making rude remarks at the guests in the back court . The flowers are bright around the brick wall , and dahlias and gladioli and the bougainvillaea perky and cheerful . It is cool and breezy on the veranda , but the sun is warm outside , and a steady stream of natives and dogs passes in front of the hotel , across the street from the CommunityTheater , as they walk down Government Road . The native women are as bright as the flowers in their cheap cotton prints , walking always behind the men , shabby in khaki or cut and resewn blankets . Bonzo , the unbelievable amalgam of bull terrier and other things , is standing always with his forelegs spraddled in front of the door , giving a suspicious stare  --  from his red eye  --  to strangers , and beaming at his friends with his black eye with the ring around it . About elevenish the cars start to draw up , and the taxis disgorge cargo , and a great deal of Nairobi comes for tea or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cup . The men are mostly in shorts or drill trousers , their legs burned sun-scaly brown . The women , if they 're in from the country , are of a uniform , either slacks or lumpy tweed skirts with cardigans and thick stockings . If the women are from the town they 're chic in summer prints , with floppy hats and nyloned legs . Most of the men are mustached heavily in the guardee fashion , with the hairs upcurlinginto their nostrils and getting tangled in their teeth . There is always a great deal of loud laughter in the bar , coming out the window from which Moussa , the bar steward , passes drinks to the porch boys . The bar is cool and dim inside , but its pictures are bright hunting scenes , and there is a long row of clever caricatures of various categories of British armed might in garish uniforms  --  the Guards and the Black Watch and the Buffs and all the others . There will be some women sitting in the big black , comfortable wooden booths at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are on the porch or in the lounge . Moussa , the pock-marked Swahili barman , knows exactly what hisp170regulars need of a morning , as does his moonfaced assistant steward , Molo . From the reports of the servants on the night before , he knows whether the Bwana John needs a cool beer , or a Coca-Cola before the first beer , or whether he wishes to dive straight into a Pimm 's and damn the cucumbers . There is never any need to scream at Moussa or repeat an order . By the time a steady customer is down to the dregs of his drink , Molo is on the way with a fresh one . Moussa took one look at Peter and John as they entered the bar , looking strangely undressed in flannels and blazers , and snapped the cap off two Karlsberg ales , bitter cold from the big refrigerator that stands next to the service window . Peter and John drained the glasses in two gulps . " Send the next ones outside on the porch , " John said , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were joined by the manager , a chubby dark man , who was zebra-marked by a few strips of plaster on his face , result of the chair round his neck . " My bloody oath , but you chaps pitched one last night , " he said . " I was lucky to get away with me life . I was down at the cottage to bring you a beer a moment ago , and it looked like somebody 'd staged a polo match in it . Are the girls alive ? " " Just barely , " Dot said , walking up and sitting down in a chair the white-skirted , red-jacketed servant held for her . She looked very pretty and fresh in her stewardess 's uniform , and there were no marks of the dirty night on her bright young face . " I shall have just one Pimm 's and no more , and maybe I can survive lunch . Betty wants the same . She 's more scars to repair than me . And please , let 's not have much conversation . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks and Betty arrived , also fresh and smart in her uniform with its perky cap . " God , " she said , " I 'm going to sleep a week in Johannesburg . Why I ever took up with white hunters I can not say . " " Well , damn it all , " Peter grinned , " you ca n't expect us to spend our lives chasing wounded buffalo in the bush and then ask us to behave like gentlemen when we strike the city . I mean to say , it 's like asking a sailor to perform like a padre when he hits port . We spend ten months a year in the bush , playing nanny to strangers , staying sober , and eating dust . It 's thirsty work . " " Speaking of clients and playing nanny , " John Thompson said , " do n't forget you 've got that new bunch due in at two-thirty. "  | " As if I 'm apt to , " Peter moaned . " We 'll have to eat early . But I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the samaki . " " The curry 's good today , " the manager said , " it 's a Madrasi . I had a taste of it meself . And there 's some cold pigeon in aspic that 's wonderful . Got just a few , so do the buffet early before they 're all snaffled . I must be off and see to a few things . Cheers . Last round 's mine . " " Jolly decent chap , old Johnston , " John said . " Changed hell 's own amount in the last year . Fancy him shouting a round two years ago . " " It 's the dog 's done it , " Peter said . " Ever since Bonzo came into his life he 's been a changed man . " " You know , you 're right , " Dottie said . " He used to be the most awful pain . But that damned dog has changed his personality . They 've both become human , and I swear the service is better now , ever since Bonzo took to biting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never knew a man not to be improved by a dog . " Peter laughed . " It 's the women that debase the men . " " Lout . Buy me one more Pimm 's and then feed me . You still owe us a meal from last night . " Again the pattern in the dining room was curious , the same related people one might see for lunch at the Outspan or the White Rhino in Nyeri , the Mawingo in Nanyuki , the New Stanley downtown in Nairobi , or the Travellers ' or the Staghom in Nakuru . They seemed pressed into design by sex and by age and by usage . At this moment a similar crowd was moving out of the bar toward the dining room in the Muthaiga Club , and one might have shuffled the guests from all the places without noting the difference . They had the look of the earlier Australian settlers . The young men all had ears that were too big and flanged out from sunburned , sort of unfinished faces , with haircuts too close or too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , and the middle-aged women were definitely dowdy , definitely dumpy , definitely skinny . Their walks , of the older ones , all seemed the same , a sort of lurch , as if their stout common-sense shoes hurt . The older men , in tweed coats and flannels or brass-buttoned blazers and flannels , always seemed to have the coattails hiked up behind , or a gap at the neck , or a wrinkled shirt collar and a twisted tie , usually blue polka dot , that jarred with a green Harris-tweed coat . The hands of all were gnarled and heavilycorded with veins . The dress hems of the older women sagged , as the seats of their skirts bagged , as their cardigans wrinkled and bunched , asp172their blouses bulged out from under the woollies . But the young men were trim in shorts or jodhpur pants , mostly with blazers and a scarf tied ascot-fashion . All who wore bush jackets and country drill seemed comfortable and well dressed and at home in them . Lunch at the Norfolk is apart from other lunches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his wonderful kind , Hitlermustached , gold-glinting smile , smart in his white stengah-shifter with the gold buttons and the stand-up collar , the basic niceness of one Portuguese parent and one Indian parent unable to hide itself even when he is angry at one of the black boys . Louie takes you to a table , and the drink steward comes , and always you have the other gin , the other whisky , and then big tankards of beer , because cool beer is as necessary to the buffet and the curry as chips to fish . You have your own table , of course , and the food is included in the hotel bill , so all you do is sign a chit for the extra drink , and the wine steward is very shy and tactful about presenting it , as is Louie when he gives you a chit for extra guests . It is big and cool and dark-shady in the Norfolk dining room for lunch , with the sun coming down hard outside , with Bonzo sitting in his own chair and ogling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discerning dog , Bonzo will find a way of introducing by tugging at their skirts if he likes you . You know if Bonzo likes you , because if Bonzo does n't like you he bites you . The Kenya folk are always a trifle tiddled at lunch . They have been to the bank to arrange an overdraft , and they 've had one over the mark with friends in the New Stanley Grill or the Queens or at the Regal , over the theater , and they 've sold some crops or been to see the warden to renew the game licenses or to report a rogue rhino or to have the lorry looked over . Or they 've been to the big dark store of the Ahamed brothers to buy a new bathrobe , or they 've nipped off to the Africa Boot Shop to buy a snakeskin purse or to have some new boots made . Earlier on they would have had tea and cakes in the vast tearoom of the New Stanley , but now they are a little tight and as hungry as hyenas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man does not need a coat or tie , whereas the New Stanley , a bit grander and which serves Mombasa oysters , frowns on careless dress . The New Stanley Grill is marvelous , but you simply ca n't pitch in , and the wine waiter never gets there with the grog . Peter and John and the girls went inside , and Louie smiled his heavenly-shy-I-love-you hello , and the bar steward brought beer . Therep173was the usual menu card , in its silver clip , which listed soup  --  always awful , and mostly of barley  --  fish , always fine , curry and chops and chips , a cold buffet , and a sweet . You never received the coffee inside . There was a table outside on the second veranda where two barefoot black boys in white and red served the coffee . A man could raise many sorts of hell in the Norfolk , but coffee in the dining room he could not get , despite the hell he raised . Peter had the fish and so did John , but the girls could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffet was a common sight in Africa and was nearly always the same , whether you ate it in Kampala in Uganda or Arusha in Tanganyika , but in the Norfolk it was usually especially fine . Great slabs of underdone red roast beef , cold , lay on delicate green lettuce leaves , and slices of white-fatted , curled-edged pink ham , and great chunks of greenish-mottled brawn and more ham , of York , and purplishredovals of salami . There were the little cold pigeons in the aspic , and cold filets of lake fish from Victoria , and crayfish salad from Mombasa . They gave you green leeks and pickled onions and cold beets and cold duck and asparagus with vinaigrette sauce or mayonnaise . There were massive salads of potato and tomato and lettuce and cucumber and radish , and bowls of sauces and **25;9240;TOOLONG , and a whole fleet of pickle boats . To one side was a nest of cheeses , domestic mostly , but with a decent imported camembert and gruyere and schweizer . A battery of sauces , Worcestershire , House of Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man could live a week off the cold buffet , but a serious eater went a little light on it and saved a mite of energy for the curry . The curry would be of fish or lobster or chicken or duck , and it would come with the bubbly soft gray chapatties that you ate with butter , or the wispy potato-chip-like chapatties that curled crisply and seemed lighter than air in your mouth , and the mound of white rice , each grain dry and separate , to be topped by the curry and its sauce , hotter than Mexican pepper , and the little peppers , bananas , pickles , coconut , and the chutney that came via a separate boy and on a separate tray . If you could get through another meat course or the anemic sweets of trifle or gritty ice cream you were lucky , but most folk settled for a slab of cheese and a cup of coffee on the porch outside . And then they went off to bed in the cool cottages and slept for two hours . Peter marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car round from the back court . He was n't going to bed . He was going to the airport , to deliver the girls and collect his clients . Hep174belched politely as he swung through the lobby and cut back behind the reception and the gift stall to the inner court where the car would be . It was a vast lunch , and with all that beer , he would have loved nothing better than to flake out for two hours , then have a bath and see who was drinking what in Moussa 's bar . Instead , he was going to the airport . He strolled down to the girls ' cottage and collected their overnight bags and piled them into the car . He drove round to the front of the Norfolk and waited for the girls to come out of the ladies ' room . He yawned again and cursed clients who always came in after a big lunch . The girls came , and they drove slowly out of the city , through the native bazaar . " I 've come through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shudders , " Betty said . " Me too , " Dottie said . " It 's not the stink and the filth so much as the way they look at you  --  as if you really were n't there . I would n't walk alone through here in the daytime , not to mention the night . " " It 's not so bad , bar the stink , which always reminds me of how a grove smells when you 've driven a herd of baboons out of it , " Peter said . " One of you women light me a cigarette , will you ? I 've a sensitive nose . I 've prowled through here at night heaps of times , looking for one of my drunken Wakambas who 's not shown up on leaving day , and I 've never had any trouble . I imagine I 've poked about in every beerdrink , gaming hut , and bawdyhouse in the quarter , and nobody ever stuck a knife in me yet . You hear the mutters as you pass , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyhow , most of the shop owners know me pretty well by now , and it would be very bad police business for them if somebody clobbered me over the skull . They walk with me . " " I do n't know how the poor sods live in this rabbit warren , though , " Betty said . " Here 's your cigarette , Bwana . There must be over fifty thousandof them packed into this sink . " " More , I should say . They 're always coming and going and changingabout . It 's awfully hard to find anybody in here if a few keen blokes really want to hide him . They shift and circle ahead of you like bongo in the bush . And you ca n't hear yourself think , what with the gramophonesand the radios going , and the muezzin screeching back aways in the mosque , and somebody pounding drums and playing flutes and singing , all in a couple of acres . They 've got no lights , bar a few smoky paraffin lamps and the cook fires . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jammed on the brakes , killed the motor in the same motion , and jumped over the door of the car . He ran back a few steps and peered into first one shop , then another , spoke swiftly in Swahili , and then dashed out of the second shop and whipped into a crooked , filthy alley . He walked back in a few seconds , shaking his head . He got into the car and started off again . The girls lifted their eyebrows . " What got into you ? You really rattled our teeth with that flaps-up landing of yours . What 'd you see ? " " I could have sworn it was him , " Peter said . " One Wog I keep looking for . I just got a small glimpse of his face , and not much of a dekko , at that . He nipped off before I could get back there , and it 's hopeless trying to find him . Besides , you really do n't want to miss that plane . The skipper would be cross . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kid I was brought up with on the farm . Just my age . Named Kimani . He was the son of my father 's headman , and we were raised up in the same kraal , more or less . We used to play together . " " What happened to him ? " " Blessed if I know . There was a spot of trouble on the farm , donkey 's years back , some mess of superstition , you know , native business . Kirnani thought he brought a curse on the house , and there was a big mumbojumbo . One of Kimani 's little brothers was born upside down , and so of course the old midwives killed it immediately . " " Do they still do that in Kenya ? " Betty asked . " They used to do things like that in South Africa , I 'm told , but I thought most of that nonsense was finished and done with . " " Still happens out in the country , and in Nairobi as well , I should n't wonder , " Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model-T Ford , its top blowtorched off and its interior packed with squirming Indians . " But what made it bad was that about the time of Kimani 's curse the Crown decided to crack down on a lot of native nonsense  --  you know , illegal dancing , circumcision of the women , beer-drinks , baby-killing , spell-casting , and poisoning , all that sort ofp176stuff . So when Karanja 's baby  --  Karanja was the father of Kimani  --  when the baby was suffocated , the police got wind of it and popped old Karanja into jail as an example . The old man drew five years and one of the old women was sentenced to be hanged . " " Did they hang her ? " " No . They were very old . One of them died just after the trial . The old man  --  my old man , I mean  --  put some pressure to bear and got a new trial . The remaining old woman and Karanja were both paroled into my father 's care . But I guess they picked up some fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with tuberculosis about a couple of years after they came loose . " " What did all this have to do with the chap you thought you saw just now ? This Kimani bloke ? " " Well , when they put Kimani 's governor in jail , Kimani thought that his curse was the cause of the whole thing and that he could clean it up , get his old boy released , if he killed the man that caused the curse . Very involved . The old witch doctor said that the curse came because Kimani had been defiled because my brother-in-law  --  you 've met Jeff  --  smacked his face for being cheeky one time when we were out on safari . So Kimani went and got a spear and hid out in Jeff 's back yard , and when Jeff came out  --  this was just after he and my sister were married  --  when Jeff came out to see about a horse or something , Kimani whipped the spear into him and took off at the speed of knots . " " Jesus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble all to ourselvesdown South . It 's worth your life to leave a door unlocked in Joburg or Capetown today . Was your brother-in-law hurt badly ? " " Not very . Spear took him in the shoulder and passed through . Made a nasty flesh wound , but Jeff 's tough as biltong . Thing was , Kimani had no way of knowing he had n't killed him , and he lit out for the high hills . We did n't do anything about police , figuring there 'd been enough row already . But I keep looking for him . He was a good kid as I remember him , and smart as mustard . We could use him on the farm  --  or I could use him with me in the bush . ' He speaks damned good English and knows a lot about simple car repair and he 'd be bloody good with the clients . My Number One is getting a little old and rheumaticky . " Peter turned the car right into a compound which held a series of flat-roofed , oblong wooden buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastleigh . " As they drew into the car-park , one of the girls pointed at a slanting sliver in the cotton-wooled sky and said :  | " Well , here comes the tired iron horse , right bang on the nose . We 'll get about our business of clearances and things . We 'll just whiz into the bar  --  which is where you 'll be , of course  --  and kiss you good-by until next trip . I suppose it 'll be Mickey and Ruth this time . See you treat ' em better than you treated us . My poor head is still killing me . " Peter slapped both girls affectionately on the rump , nodded at the hostess at the reception , and swung off toward the bar . There was n't much he could do until the plane set down and the first immigration clearance was made , although he knew the customs people better than he knew his safari string . The Indian and the Goanese customs clerks were quite decent , really , and he never had any trouble with guns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victualing made out all the correct forms and permits , and it was just a formality to bring the clients ' equipment in and out . Also , here they did n't check the bags too closely , for clients , especially the Americans , always came overweighted with cigarettes and whisky and cosmetics and drugs and the other dutiableitems . Peter walked past the information desk and cut across the catwalk and passed through the little bar and waiting room and then through the dining room and into the long bar with the big windows , where you could watch the planes land in front of the signpost that gave all the various distances from Nairobi to places like Addis Ababa and Cairo and New York and Rome and Paris . He nodded to the black bar steward and a few acquaintances , dropped into a chair , and signaled for a beer . He would have his beer , kiss the girls good-by , say hello to the new two , make a date to see them at the hotel after he got his people settled , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them some cocktailsand an early dinner at the Stanley , and then whip off and do the town with the girls . There was never much time in town , and you had to pack a lot of no-sleep carousing into the three , four , or five days you had between getting rid of one bunch and taking on another . He would n't bother with those two types he 'd left up at Mawingo . He did n't want to see them again . John Thompson was n't safari-ing for another week , and John could take them to the taxidermist , clear their weapons , and shove ' em onto the plane . John was very good about lending a bloke a hand that way . The big plane eased down on the runway , bumped slightly , braked , turned , and swung in toward the airport buildings . The uniformed black boys trundled out the disembarking steps , and the small caravan of par/ters , baggage trucks , officials , and askaris swarmed out toward the plane like efficient ants . The doors opened , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the passengers began to totter down the stairs , carrying their flight bags and attache cases and topcoats , and wearing the blinking , owlish look of people who have been trapped in a dark stuffy closet and are now tasting fresh light air . Peter had had a lot of practice spotting clients by now . There would be the few Germans first , heading for Tanganyika , who would jostle out ahead of the others . Then the Dutch , going on down South , and then some returning locals , looking eagerly for the faces of relatives . Then there would be some new English  --  apt as not wearing solar topis and spine pads , under the mistaken idea that Nairobi was steamy tropical instead of being six thousand feet high and twice as cold as Christmas , despite its location smack on the equator . There would be a few assorted bewildereds and some Indians , small and green-gold from being airsick , pushing from behind , the women back in saris , now they were coming home , and the men looking undressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pajama pants and a pair of slapping slippers . And then there would be the clients , coming out last or nearly so . The first things you would look for were the cameras slung over their shoulders and the mink coat on the woman . If the clients were young the man would be tall , slim , and crew-cut . Blond or brunet , the man would always be crew-cut . The woman would be beautiful , for young crew-cut men with enough money to pay Peter 's prices always married beautiful women . This year she would be blond , no matter what the natural hair color was . It was a blond year . And she would be wearing a simple traveling suit of sharkskin or gabardine or some other non-rumplabledress for travel , a tiny hat , and the shoes , bag , and gloves would have been bought in Rome on the way out . The young man 's suit would be J. Press or Brooks and would be cut with no padding in the shoulders , and the shirt would be button-down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course . If the man were English the suit would be cut the same way , from somebody in Savile Row , and the tie would be poplin or rep and have school stripes on it . If the clients were old there were several possible variations . The man would certainly be fat or else very , very thin . But mostly fat . There were two kinds of old men 's wives . One type was as fat or thin and as old as the man , and the two people would look exactly alike owing to having been married to each other so long . But the other type , whenp179the man was fat , the woman would be very young , very blond and tightly curled , very much minked , with a separate mink of another color on her arm , and she would look like either a tart or a shorthand typist , depending on whether the old boy had got himself trapped in a cabaret or in his office . If the woman were young the old boy would be solicitous and flutter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw moods and eventually wind up by gently pressing her bosom against Peter 's shoulder when they rode in the Land Rover . Then it would just be a question of when she got Peter alone , and under what conditions of moonlight and weather and displeasure at the husband . There they were . Peter smiled . The crew-cut was blond . The man was six feet two and slim . He carried a covert-cloth topcoat and wore a Rolleiflex on one side , a Leica on the other , the straps crisscrossed over his chest like bandoleers . He wore a brown Cavanagh hat with a black band and with the crown undented on the sides . Shirt , oxford buttondown . Tie , black knit . Golden bar across tie , " 21 " Club . School , Harvard , Yale , or Princeton . Looked a pleasant type , as did the girl . Coat , short honey-brown wild mink . Suit , severe . Either a Balenciaga or a Hattie . Peter knew all the names of the better couturieres and could recognize their peculiarities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unshootablehead , looking through the sweated glasses in the blurring heat . This was a pretty girl , dark , but with one blond streak . She had compromised on the season . He could n't see the color of her eyes , but the shape of the mouth was nice and the face pleasant . They walked purposefully toward the detaining room , and Peter got up to meet them . Dottie and Betty rushed in and flung him a hurried kiss , and while he was paying his bar chit he managed to miss seeing the last passenger to leave the plane . She was tall and her hair was a deep red-bronze . She had great curving wings of dark brows , and the Kipsigi porter who carried her bag might have said that her eyes were as green as the darting pigeons that flashed through the woods , but he would have been wrong , because the eyes were the color of the reflection of clear water on a green-lichened rock on which heavy copper content had touched a golden fleck to the green of the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a slightly long but very straight nose , and great wide mouth with slightly fleshy but very well cut lips , and a chin that was clean as the prow of a racing yacht . She was wearing a beige suit and a green blouse , and the suede of her bag and gloves almost matched her hair . She hadp180almost abnormally long legs and good square shoulders and a trim top , what there was to be seen of it under the hard lines of her suit . She walked a long-legged , free-swinging stride , and her lips were parted in excitement . She was back in Kenya for the first time in six years , and her name was Holly Keith . Peter winked at one of the passport-control attendants and entered into the forbidden territory . His people were on the other side of the room , which was jammed . The bronze-haired girl had dropped her flight bag and was searching for a match in her purse , her hands full of gloves and passport and landing papers . Her face was turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the figure in the beige suit decided him that the new clients could wait a moment , since they did n't know who he was , anyhow . He dug out the Zippo some client had given him and flicked it near the cigarette which drooped from the corner of her mouth . " Offer you a light ? " " Thanks most awfully , " the girl said , and swung round to face him . The green eyes widened , and the eyebrows flew up . " Peter McKenzie ! " she said . " Peter McKenzie , grown up to be a man and picking up strange women in airports ! " " Good God , " Peter said , letting the flame go out . " It ca n't be little Holly Keith from next door . Not that little --  " " None other . Six years make that much difference ? It has n't in you . And I 'll have the light , please , pickup or not . I 'm starved for a smoke . " Holly puffed deeply and smiled at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most women with green eyes have found effective and unsettling . " I swear I 'd not have known you except for the legs . Nobody else I ever knew had legs as long as you did when you were a filly . Anybody meeting you ? " " I thought the family , but they may 've missed my cable . I had to take an earlier plane and cabled them from Cairo . I do n't see them through the iron bars , in any case . "   " Look , " Peter said . " I 've got a couple of clients over in the corner . I must just go and get them started . When you get in customs I 'll check your bags through to the hotel , and you ride in with me and the clients . We 'll book you a room and have some chakula and I 'll drive you up to the farm tomorrow if your people have n't shown . Right ? " " That 's very nice . Chakula . How long since I 've heard Swahili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and not being met . You run along and tend to your sheep . I 'll not have any trouble with the passport people . I 'm awfully glad somebody I know was out here . " " Right . Take care . " Peter turned and headed toward the clients , who were looking nervously around the cheerless room . He bumped into one of the hostesses , whose face brightened . " Peter darling . Did you come to ride us in ? " Peter jumped . " Oh , hi , Ruth , " he said , pecking her on the cheek . " I 'm afraid not . I 've got a earful of clients . There would n't be room for you in the Rover . See you at the hotel . I must get over to my people . " He walked rapidly away , and the pretty little plump stewardess looked blankly after him . Peter , when he was in town , always met the plane . Clients or no clients , he deposited the two outgoing girls and collectedthe incoming crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her eyebrows , the left higher than the other . Peter walked up to the clients . He smiled and extended a hand . " I 'm Peter McKenzie , " he said . " I expect you 're the Deanes . I 'm your white hunter , come to collect you and your stuff . Sorry I 'm a bit late , but I ran into a very old friend and had to say hello . " The Deanes smiled back and looked relieved . The man shook Peter 's hand . So did his wife , gripping it firmly . " Tom Deane , " he said . " My wife , Nancy . God , I 'm glad to see you . I 'm new at this . We had all sorts of ideas about being stranded here with about sixteen cases , all full of guns and cameras and other hot articles . " " Well , if you 'll give me your baggage checks I 'll just Rip round and see to the customs . I ca n't help you with the passports , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hand them to that chap with the turban and the whiskers , and then he 'll pass you through into customs . See you in a minute . " " What a very nice-looking boy , " Nancy Deane said as Peter walked away , striding largely , slightly pigeon-toed from tracking , his long arms swinging forward of his knees in a peculiar rhythm . " I do n't know whether I 'm relieved or worried . I thought all professional hunters werep182old men , bitter from some unfortunate love affair , hiding their sorrows in the jungle . This one looks like a schoolboy . " " Well , he 's supposed to be the best there is . Your uncle Jim shot with him out here last year , and so did a guy I was in school with . He may look like a kid , but they swear by him . I 'd judge he 's about my age , no older . " " He 's powerful pretty , honey , " Nancy Deane said . " I can see where these jungle nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of that Francis Macomber business , friend . You do n't go shooting me in the neck . I am no Gregory Peck , just plain Tom Deane from Connecticut , rich but unassuming orphan . Oh , the Beard is beckoning . Let 's go get these passports stamped . I want a martini of no less than one quart in size , and with no vermouth in it at all . " " Are you excited ? " his wife asked him . " I 'm thrilled to bits . Look at all those black savages and Indians and things . It is like the movies . I keep expecting to see Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr pop up in the crowd . Oh , look , Junior , now there is what I would call a pretty girl , the redheaded one over there . " Tom Deane whistled . " I knew I should have come on this thing stag . I would n't be surprised if that is n't the old friend our new teacher had to say hello to . " The babu stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter had stacked a vast array of gun cases and valises on the shelf . " There 's no trouble about the guns if the serials you sent me check . I pay the entry duty , and when you 've safely gone they pay me it back . Anything in these other cases you want to declare  --  tobacco , whisky , stuff like that ? " " No , nothing , " Tom Deane said . " No American cigarettes ? " the customs clerk asked incredulously . " None but a few packs in my coat pockets . " " Very well , sar . But I must look in the one bag . It is my duty . Will you be so kind as to open that one ? " pointing to a pigskin traveling case of the square sort ladies use . He flicked open the bag , looked horrified , and as hurriedly snappedit shut . He was very dark , but he managed to blush under it . " Verygood , sar , " he said . " The luggage will go round to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went over to where Holly Keith waswaiting her turn in customs . " Come and meet these people , " Peter said.  | " They seem quite nice . Chat with them a minute and I 'll do your stuff for you . " He led Holly over to where the Deanes waited . " This is Miss Keith , an old neighbor of mine come home from abroad , Mrs. Deane , Mr. Deane . Holly here is riding into town with us , if you do n't mind a squeeze . You just stroll out to the gharri and I 'll be with you in a jiff . " " You 've been away quite a while ? " Nancy Deane asked as they walked out to the bright sunlight . " Six years , " Holly said . " I was a kid when I left , just after the war ended . I went to school in England , and last year I did Europe . I 'm home to stay now , I hope . " " You 've people here , of course ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , and a little brother who must be enormous by now . My family has a farm next Peter 's father 's place . I ca n't imagine why they are n't here to meet me . " " I suppose you 've known Mr. McKenzie  --  this Mr. McKenzie  --  all your life ? " " Well , ever since I can remember . I proposed marriage to him when I was ten or twelve , and got a smack on the bottom for my pains . He was an enormous great boy of fifteen at the time , and he thought I was rather a nauseating child . The only time he ever paid any attention to me was when he needed me to be a tribe of natives or a herd of buffalo or something , when he was playing war games with a little black chap who lived on his farm . My most tender memories of Peter McKenzie have to do with his sister picking cactus spines out of my trousers . Peter was abducting Kikuyu women that day , and I was two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Possibly because I kicked him . I do n't exactly remember . It 's been ten years and a bit . " Peter came out of the airport . " All serene , " he said . " It 'll be a tight squeeze in this Rover . Supposeyou take the back , Mr. Deane , and we stow the ladies in the front with me . It 'll be more comfortable for them . Those seats are a mite hard . " " Sure , " Tom Deane said , swinging a leg over the low rail . " Away we go . Might as well start now calling us Tom and Nancy . We 've got the next three months together , and I 'm not much of a Mister-man exceptwith people I do n't like . " " Me either . I used to call this young woman here Holly , but she 's grown up so grand I do n't know whether or not I 'm permitted a first name . For all I know , she 's married , seeing as she 's got gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned . " I came home to marry you , as I often used to threaten . Since I 've seen you , black as a nigger , I think I 've changed my mind . However do you get that color ? " At the word " nigger " Nancy Deane winced ever so slightly . It was the first time in her life that she had heard it spoken . " I 've been up in the N.F.D. , " Peter said . " It 's hotter'n the hinges up there now . " " What 's N.F.D. ? " Tom Deane asked . " The Northern Frontier District , " Peter replied . " The hot country 's North here , the cold country 's South . We 're just a tiny touch over the equator . But there 's a hotel near my home where the equator line is supposedto run right through the middle of the barroom floor . You can stand and talk to a friend whilst you 're having a drink , with each of you on opposite sides of the equator . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got her first look at Africa , heard her first African sounds , smelled her first African smells . She seemed stunned . The smell was enough to stun a stranger . The drive from the Eastleigh Airport to the Norfolk Hotel is shockingto a newcomer . As you drive along Race Course Road you are past the better Indian residences and come upon the native quarter , the squirming bazaars. in the bazaars most of the shops , duccas , are still Indian , but they are smaller and dirtier and more flyblown and more higgledy-piggledythan the ones closer in toward town , with cheaper prices and inferior goods . They sell candy and Kali snuff and cheap cigarettes , bolts of shoddy cloth made in Birmingham for export , castoff clothes , old Army-issue overcoats , nauseating soft drinks , inferior beer , canned foods , tennis shoes , and sticky fly-encrusted cakes . Straggling between are a few shops , shabbier , smaller , and less well stocked , which bear names like Karioki wa Muchiri or Njuguna wa Kamau , indicating that a native has come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin from hammered petrol drums , or walls of mud and thatch , or old packing boxes , and they have lumpy earthern floors and dark smoke-crusted interiors . They sell the fifth-hand clothing that comes from the thieves ' market or the native pawnshops and that always seem to flap forlornly from clotheslines in the occasional well-guarded muddy clearing . These shops sell dirty pannikins of sickly-sweet tea , and specky rice , and a native beer that is more like gruel than beer . In some of thep185eating inns you can buy moldy yams and a bowl of mutton or goat mixed with posho , the mealie-maize staple cereal . In the interiors you can see the natives squatting , making a ball of the posho with their hands and then punching a hole in it with a finger to make room for a sliver of meat or a thick and indefinable greasy gravy of rancid fat and God knows what . Some people squat , some sprawl , against the crazyleaningwalls . Some are drunk in the sun , some are merely asleep . The assorted smells are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialects fight for supremacy , without victory  --  Swahili , Meru , Embu , Kikuyu , Wakamba , Kipsigi , Kavirondo , Arabic , Pushto , Urdu , Hindustani , Portuguese , Goanese , Pondichery French , English , Masai , Somali , Nandi , German , and Greek . There is a wail of children , a blat of goats , a harsh rattle of phonograph , a shrill giggle from one of the filthy huts , a muezzin 's prayerful wail , a thump of drum , the smack of a blow and a scream of pain to follow , a mournful chant , an Arab song on the wireless , and the ceaseless static of argument , bicker , bargain , and boast . Frizzy-headed black whores in European dress , but barefoot , spread-toed , flat-arched , laugh and haggle over prices in the writhing knots of people that cling desperately to the corners like the clotted clusters of flies that hang to the blackened strips of meat and over the goats ' and sheep 's heads in the butcher shops , flies that crawl drunkenly along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souring sweets . And always there is a ceaseless , relentless stream of plodding people  --  people coming in from town or going out to town , crowding the sides of the roads on bicycles and afoot , on sway-backed burros and packed like shrimp in buses and lurching lorries . The women ever bear some burden on their backs  --  whether food , firewood , or a few pitiful belongings ; their necks bow and the carrying strap creases their foreheads . The smells hang in the air like a low cloud . The smells are inseparableand form one tremendous acrid essence in which the sweetish odors of rotted meat and decayed fruits blend with the sharpness of urine and the dung of animals and humans , mixing with the smell of curryand smoldering cow dung and the sharp nose-itching odor of goats and human sweat and hot sun and strong cheap tobacco and filthy vermin-riddenclothes and untended huts and unclean sickness and rancid cooking fat and drifting hashish and swirling red dust and cheap sicksmellingperfume and rank alcohol and musk . It lies over the bazaarp186like a dirty cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It enters your clothes if you pass on foot , or strikes a club-blow in your nostrils as you drive slowly past in a car . As you come by in a car , as Peter and Holly and the Deanes slowly drove along to reach the town , you are conscious of one thing  --  a singlenessof black expression . There is no curiosity , no active anger , only a great sweeping animal dumb animosity , a massed swing of the heads , like cattle against an enemy , and a frozen stare . Shrill laughter ceases in the small confabbing groups you pass . Talk stops , and the animation ceases . There is only the completely blank look , the look of nothing behind the eyes , no expression near the mouth , nothing . Nothing . The black man in Kenya crouches behind that blank staring wall , and no white man can penetrate that wall when the black man builds it . As your car passes in a puff of dust , the chatter resumes behind you and silence drops just ahead of you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these shacks ? " " They jolly well do . About fifty thousand of them , I reckon . They 're happy enough . You 'll see after you 've been out here a few days that these niggers are different to what your niggers are . Yours have been down out of the tree longer . These boys are n't here very far away from the baboons . " Again the word " nigger . " It touched a nerve . Traffic on Delamere Avenue and Government Road thins out past islands on which plum-black native police swing their batons with militaryprecision and savage grace . Their invariably skinny legs look strangely storkish in wrapped blue puttees under wide uniform khaki shorts . The streets ferment with a fantastic assortment of races and colors . In a single block you may see big , husky , fierce-bearded Sikhs wearing their close-wrapped pleated turbans and carrying the five iron charms  --  knife , bracelet , comb , bangle , ring  --  under their smart European clothing . There are high-nosed , delicate Arabs from the coast , the old men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Greeks and Syrians , and small , often beautiful Hindi women with studs in their noses and red religious ceremony daubs on their foreheads . The shops of Nairobi are chiefly Asian , and the names reveal that the followers of Allah , Buddha , and of the Agha Khan have mostly collared the commerce . Sudhoo , Botlivala , Karamji , Patel , Biram Singh , WVali Mohomet , Krishnakarta  --  the long line leads front Race Course Roadp187through the bazaars , where they are only thinly interspersed with an occasionalnative name , mostly over a filthy hotel or teashop . The native parade on Nairobi 's streets , especially its side streets and back streets , is motley . Goatskin-caped Masai with spears and ocher-clay make-up swagger arrogantly along the sidewalks . Kikuyu men wearing castoff khaki and old Army-issue clothes , patched and repatched on the patches , nearly always wearing water-soaked and shapeless European hats , walk at the head of their women or squat in clusters on the corners . Here and there you see a country Kikuyu with vast blocks of wood or dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder level . The women , slick-skulled , wear shapeless cotton dresses of wild greens and reds and purple , and invariably carry a baby in the crook of their arms . The younger Kikuyu are identifiable by the unpierced ears  --  or if once they had fist-wide holes they now have had them clipped and resewn . But the non-citified Nandi and Wakamba still stretch the lobes and tuck the pierced bottoms neatly over the tops . Many of the strollers are marked by disease and accident  --  here , perhaps , an old man with no nose , only a red-crusted , angry cavern , he holding out a begging cup or peddling little badly carven figurines ; over there a wizened , graywooledmzee staggering against his staff and favoring his hideously twisted leg . The Indians scuttle briskly along , many of the men wearing khaki pith helmets and carrying swagger sticks in an effort to appear English . They stubbornly hold their own , even dominate the footpaths , while the natives  --  in the white section of the city  --  move carefully aside . The whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intended direction , sometimes standing in conversation at the crossings , delaying the hooting traffic while they terminate a conversation . There is always a tremendous squawk of auto horns and bicycle bells in Nairobi , always a great bustle on the main streets and a jabber of a hundred different languages and dialects . The city 's appearance is as polyglot as its people . It is rather an ugly , largely treeless city , except for the scabby eucalypti which line its dusty streets , but out toward the edges there is a sudden upthrust of damp green of fir and fig and acacia , of jacaranda and flame , of cedar and palm . The private homes are almost obscenely riotous with flowers . The city 's architecture is fantastic , square white buildings of several stories , slashed by sunlight and shade , and mostly all ugly ; here the deli/cate minaret of a mosque , here a sprawling Indian school of a violent yellow , there a house of pierced plaster in the Arab mood , and on the edges , long , ugly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limuru are rolling and wet-green and lushforested , as in any good suburb . The better-class white dwellings are snugged by trees and flowers , and the best boast their swimming pools and clipped tennis courts . The richer Indians have their fine homes , too , but not in the white districts . The Indian homes loom square and hideous on the dusty plains on the road to Thika . They sit starkly like yellow boxes , plastered in the front for show , but revealing ugly gray cement block , unstuccoed , behind , and with their plastered porticos carven in Indian scrollwork . They came into town , and as they drove down Delamere Avenue they passed Lord Delamere 's statue . The little man 's likeness captured quite a lot of his fabled audacity . " Who 's that fellow ? " Tom Deane asked . " Him on the pedestal ? " " Old Lord Delamere . The one that opened up these parts for the white settlers . Wagered his fortune and wrecked his health trying to make this what he called white man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Office tried to take away the settlers ' lands back in ' 22 . Led a delegation to London , a bunch of hairy settlers and a couple of Masai warriors with spears . Told the Whitehall chaps that unless they called off their dogs Kenya was going to do what you people did and bloody well declare war on England . Home Office backed down . England could hardly afford to get mixed up in a war with one of its colonies at that time , and the settlers were dead serious . They were going to kidnap the Governor , just for starters . " " He must have been quite a gent , " Tom Deane said . " He was . My father told me once when Delamere was having some Government red-tape trouble here one time he collected a crowd of settlersand went over and set fire to Government House . Whether it 's true or not , I could n't say . But I do know he used to get drunk and pick fights in the Norfolk bar , and when all the fists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , and then dive headlong into the mess , feet and fists churning . For a proper baron tracing back to the twelfth century , he was quite a rough ' un . " " It all sounds fascinating , " Nancy Deane said . " Is that the Norfolk Hotel there , the red long building down the road ? " " Yep . That 's your home for the next couple of days . I 've booked youp189into one of the better cottages . This cottage has two bedrooms and a quite decent living room . You 've got so much gear that if we try to put it all in the living room you wo n't have any place to sit . " He turned the car down the narrow alleyway leading to the back court and pulled up in front of a bigger cottage than his own , at the head of the square horseshoe of linked cottages . A shrill voice spoke from a tree . " Peter 's a clot ! Peter 's a clot ! Peter 's got a new girl ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all these things to say , " Peter grumbled . " Shut up , you gray buzzard , or I 'll feed you to Bonzo . " " Bonzo being ? " " Dog . Belongs to the manager . This place is crawling with livestock . Now . You good people just nip in here and look at your new quarters . I suppose you 'll want a wash . I see Kamachi standing at the door to greet you . He 's a wonderful Wog , and dead honest . I 'll just take Holly over and see about a room for her , and then we 'll all meet on the veranda for a drink , what ? I daresay you could use one . " The Deanes entered their cottage and got a Jambo-Bwana JamboMemsaabfrom Kamachi , while Peter led Holly Keith over the cobbles to the back entrance of the hotel . The manager , Johnston , met them at the reception , on which Bonzo was squatted , both feet on the registry , while he leered with his red eye and lolled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager said . Bonzo jumped down , walked around the corner of the office , sniffed Holly 's skirt , and kissed her hand . " He likes you , " the manager said . " But no matter . Your father 's just been on the phone . Your cable went wrong and has only just got through to him . He was n't expecting you until the next flight . He 's pranged the car , someway or other , and ca n't come in until tomorrow . " " Oh , " Holly said . " I am relieved . I was frightened something awful had happened . Can you put me up for the night ? Things are dreadfully crowded , I know . " " Surely , Miss Keith . " The manager showed his teeth in a wide smile of purest malice . " I 've taken the liberty of moving Mr. McKenzie andp190Mr . Thompson in with me . There is not another room in the house or at the New Stanley , either . I 've got people sleeping in broom closets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " " Of course you could , " Peter said . " We do this all the time . Every time Johnston gets in a muddle he moves me . I 've spent so much time in his cottage that people think we 're a bit peculiar . " " Well , it 's wonderful , and if I may I 'll run over and fresh up a bit . What 's the number ? " " Ten . The door 's open . Your stuff just came on the van and I 've sent it round with the porters . Make sure you count it . " " Oh yes , and , Holly , " Peter said , " I imagine your father will be ringingthrough again later on , and why do n't you tell him not to be bothered with coming all the way in from the farm ? I have to go up to see my guv'nor tomorrow , to collect some clothes and a gun , and I 'd love to drive you . Right ? " " Marvelous . I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrub some of this grime off me . See you in the bar a little later . Thank you , Mr. Johnston . You 've been very kind . And so 've you , Peter . Ta . " Holly ran toward Peter 's cottage . " My word , what a stunner that one 's got to be , " Johnston said . " I rememberher as a little girl , all knobs and knees and freckles . Come along , Bonzo , let 's go and buy the Bwana a spot of something . " " If you 're reckoning to move in on this , my lad , " Peter said as they went down the veranda toward the nearly empty bar , " you have bloody well got another think coming . I staked this one out when she was a child and have just been waiting to see how she 'd turn out . This is my own secret country , chum , and you ai n't allowed in it . And not to go running off your mouth about my carryings on , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to force his way into the stewardess 's shack one night when he roared home polluted from the Travellers ' . But I 'll take that drink now whilst my clients tidy . " " What sorts are they ? Bloody ? " " Very unbloody , at first glance . But you never can tell . I 've seen ' em sweeter than honey in town and at each other 's throats , and mine , after a week in the bush . We will see , but I 'm betting these are all right . " The manager and Peter were drinking a beer when Tom Deane walked in , fresh-changed to flannels and tweed coat . He had washed and his hair still glistened with moisture . Peter introduced them . " My God , I feel wonderful , now I 'm actually here , but I ca n't be-P191lieve it , " he said . " Can a fellow get a real dry martini around here ? With Gordon 's and Noilly Prat ? I want a double , at least . " " Martini a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll be right . We had an American purist out here last year , and he clued old Moussa up just dandy . Rooms all right ? " " Real fine . Who do I thank for the flowers and the bottle of gin and the bottle of whisky ? " " Flowers are mine , " Peter said . " Old Johnston here provides the booze . Impresses the clients no end . Puts ' em in his debt so 's they wo n't scream when the service is awful and the phone wo n't go . He gets it back on the bill twice over , anyhow . I say , Tom , what did your wife have in that bag that horrified the customs chap so ? Snakes ? " " No , Kotex . Actually there were thirty cartons of Luckies stashed under the snowdrift . " " Well , it 's damned lucky he picked that particular bag to open , becausethirty cartons of American cigarettes would have really tossed the cat amongst the pigeons . " " Oh , we were safe enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies ' intimate business over the tops of all the bags . Never had a customs man dig under it yet . " " American ingenuity , " the manager said . " They think of everything . No wonder everybody over there has a Cadillac . " Tom Deane tasted his martini carefully , and his face glowed . " I have n't had one like that since Ziggy built the last one at Toots Shor 's . Can we do this on safari ? " " You can if you want to trouble about a portable icebox . I find the water bags keep the stuff cool enough , from the condensation . Gin bottle'sgot beads on it in the morning . We have about a twenty-degree temperature drop in less'n an hour . After fourteen hours mucking about in that jeep in a hot sun , you 'll drink your gin scalding if necessary and it 'll still taste good . " " What do we do when the girls get here ? " " Well , I thought we 'd sit here and have a drink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go downtown to an Indian place I know and buy you a bite . Dining room 's closed here now , it 's a little late . Then perhaps we 'll go and collect some gear ; you wo n't need much , pants and bush jackets and a few odds and ends . You 've got boots ? " " Birdshooters . " " The best . But we 'll have the little Wahindi make you an extra set ,  |p192and  some mosquito boots as well . Then you and the Mem can seize a little sleep if you 'd like , and I 'll take us all to dinner at the Equator . There 's some music and dancing later , and the food 's jolly decent . You can ask me lots of questions and I 'll try to answer them as best I can . All right if I ask Holly to feed with us ? " " Of course . But it 's my party . I do n't get to Nairobi every day . Nancy 's dithering around like a sixteen-year-old . She 's expecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Say , here come the women now . They seem to have timed the entry , a thing I never understood about women . " Nancy Deane had changed into a yellow afternoon frock , and Holly Keith appeared in a lime-green linen suit that subtly changed the color of her eyes . " What a lovely hotel , " Nancy Deane said . " And I think the room boy in the nightdress is divine . What 's that you 're drinking , Tom ? It looks alarmingly like a martini . " " It is . You 've got its twin coming . How about you , Miss Keith  --  Holly ? Martini ? " " I think perhaps not . I think rather a gin and tonic , please . Martinis do very strange things to my metabolism , especially when I 'm tired . And you 'll both admit that the hop from Khartoum is n't a true health cure . " " I just ca n't imagine I 'm in Africa . It 's all so civilized . I sort of expectedeverybody to be hairy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard . But this is like a mountain resort town , " Nancy said . " Very few years ago , when my father first came , all the men wore guns , and every night they shot up the bars . In the old days of this very same hotel they used to shoot the tiles off the roof for fun . And I can still put you in a taxi and show you a lion inside of an hour . As a matter of fact , one of the safari firms had to send a bloke to shoot a leopard out of a hen coop in the native quarter just last night . If the wind 's right you 'll hear hyenas howling tonight . " Peter pointed at Holly with his cigarette end . " I wonder if you remember , Holly , the story your father used to tell about going out into the yard in the dark to harness a donkey , and the donkey let out a frightful roar ? He 'd tried to clap a bridle on a lion that was raiding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I never believed it . " Holly smiled . " Give Dad one over the quota and his imagination gets rather vivid . But 1 do remember running onto more than one rhino in the road not morep193than five hundred yards from the house . Mother writes that you can still hear the lions plainly when they go down to Naivasha for week ends , and a hippo bit a canoe in two the other day . " " I say , I 've an idea , " Peter said . " I must absolutely stop off at my farm tomorrow , and then too I 've got to drive Holly home . If I curse loud enough we can have all your stuff ready by noon tomorrow . Why would n't it be a good idea to have an early lunch and drive up to the farm , spend the night , and cut on over to the Masai tomorrow ? I can fix all your Kenya licenses in the morning . Then I thought we might go to Tanganyika to a place I know where the grass is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common stuff there . Are you especially mad keen to shoot an elephant ? "  --  Not very especially ,  --  Tom Deane said . " I 'd rather take it sort of easy at first . Like I keep saying , I 'm new at this business . But I like the Tanganyika idea . Much of a drive ? " " Two days ordinarily , but there 's been a bit of rain and I 'm told some of the tracks over the mountains have washed out . Might take three . But the last day 's a wonderful trek across the Serengeti Plains , and the wildebeest and zebra migration ought to be starting about now . If you 're lucky you 'll see half a million animals in a day , and at least fifty lions . Ca n't shoot , of course . It 's a preserve . I thought that if you 'd like I 'll send the lorry on ahead with the stuff and have them make a camp in a very pleasant spot j know outside Narok , in the Masai reserve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . " " It sounds wonderful to me , " Nancy said . " I 'd love to see how real people live out here  --  not the safari people or the tourists or the town people , but real people who have homes here . " " That 's fine , then . Ill get John Thompson  --  he 's a friend of mine  --  to drive you two up in his car , and I 'll take Holly in mine . John and I both have gunbearers , and they 'll ride in back of the Rover . We 'll put everything but your overnight kit into the lorry . " " What do I wear ? " Nancy asked . " To your house , I mean ? " " Pants and jacket , " Peter said . " What we 'd best dash off and arrange for now . You might take a pair of ordinary slacks and a sweater to change over if you want . It 's nippy up in those hills . " A black servant came into the room , tinkling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " scribbled on it . " That 'll be your father ringing through , " Peter said . " Tell him you 'll be home in the latish afternoon . Then go and have yourself a nap . Itp194might get to be late out tonight . I 'll knock you up at seven , right ? " " Right . I suppose Daddy can wait another hour or so after six years . Bye-bye , all , till later . " Holly finished her drink and went away to the phone kiosk . Peter called the boy and paid the bill . " First off we 'd best go and get you suitably clothed , " he said . " Ahamed does a good job in a hurry , and so does the boot shop . You 'll have your duds complete by noon . Let 's be off , shall we ? " " Fine . I want to buy one of those wonderful floppy hats that the movie hunters wear , " Nancy said . " I want to tie a leopard tail around it to have photographs taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happen to have any children at the moment , do we ? " Tom said . " I hope . " " No , but I thought I 'd take care of the hat , anyhow . You never can tell . " " Oh , one thing , " Peter said as they rose to go . " Have you any dinner clothes with you ? I thought we 'd go to the Equator for dinner , and it 's a formal night . " " Oh , sure . I was warned we might need a black tie . " " Well , then , let 's go and fit you out for the bush . Kwenda . " " That means what ? " " Let 's go . When it 's let's-go-in-a-hurry it 's pese pese : " " Kwenda , " Nancy said . " Pese pese . I think I 'm going to like the language . " They went to Ahamed 's and were measured for bush jackets with cartridgeloops for the big bullets , and pants and shorts , and on Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous woolly bathrobesand double-brimmed terai hats and two big tin trunks to put it all in . Then they went over to the boot shop and got measured for extra shoes by the smiling little bucktoothed Indian who carefully traced their feet and kept their American boots to model from . Nancy wanted to buy all the leopard-skin slippers and croc-hide belts and zebra doodads and Indian brocade slippers with curly toes , but Peter gently told herp195that it would be much smarter to do it after they returned . Then they went and collected ammunition from Peter 's strongbox and bought pocketknivesand flashlights and a few girl-things for Nancy from the drugstore and still had time to pop into the New Stanley for tea , which they decided on to replace lunch . It was nap time when they got back to the Norfolk . John Thompson joined them for drinks at eight  --  they all overslept in the cool dark cottages , from varying types of fatigue  --  and then they met , merry and rested , in the Norfolk bar . Peter placed the girls on stools and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberant types , who had been working at the grog from a little earlier in the day . At eight o'clock the Norfolk bar reminded Tom Deane of San Francisco in the war . There was the same air of shore-leave exuberance from the young bucks in dinner jackets , in dusty shorts , in flannels and tweeds . Everybody smiled widely . Everybody talked too loud . Everybody greeted everybody else as long-lost friends , with a ringing clap on the back , or a cuff on the side of the head , and a roaring invitation to drink . There was no conversation . There was rather a series of short bursts of sound , such as a ship 's anti-aircraft battery makes , the rattle of twentymillimetersgiving way to the sharp clap of the .3505 and the heavier boom of the .538s . The noise also reminded Tom Deane of John Dos Passos ' old writing device , the camera eye , when all the things people said were crocheted into a tapestry of noise and nobody ever quite finished a sentence . The laughter was full-bodied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . Peter and John were accosted by at least a dozen , men and girls , all of whom were introduced by the completely idiotic English " Do you know So-and-so , " when there was really no remote chance of anyone ever having met before . The circle spread to include the newcomers , all of whom seemed unduly excited over nothing at all . Since each addition demanded the chance to buy a round of drinks , Tom Deane figured that he was about thirty scotches behind the already-paid-for orders . Holly Keith , sitting strikingly on her stool , soon was discovered as the little Keith girl who had been away to England and my word , what a smasher she 's turned out , was besieged by sunburned young men who seemed to stretch well upward past six feet , and all of whom seemed on the verge of proposing marriage within minutes . The smoke thickened with the noise , and finally Peter nudged Tom , who was vastly enjoying himself , and said :  | " For Christ 's sake let 's get out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've changed my mind about dinner at the Equator . It 'll be dull as dirt until midnight , and the food 's nothing so very much . We 'll feed a lot better at the Stanley , and a lot quieter than here . I 'll ring up and hold my table at the Equator and we 'll go there and dance a bit later . All right ? " " Sure . Anything you say . But if we do n't leave here soon we wo n't have any women . The competition is a bit stiff , hey ? " " It 's due to a shortage of women in Kenya . The veriest hags come out here from England to work , and they 're all married off in a snap . I 'm told it was the same in America in the early days . " They collected their women over roars of male disapproval and fought a way out into the clean , fresh-washed night air , on which the odor of flowers trembled . " God , what a crush , " Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink ? " " Well , a lot of them work pretty hard , " Peter said , steering them toward the car . " And when they come to town they blow some steam . They 're goodhearted chaps , most of them , but a little uncurried . They do n't drink to stay sober . They drink to get pi  --  drunk . We have an international reputation for it out here . " Holly said as they drove off downtown to the Stanley : " You know , that 's my first experience with masses of young Kenya gentlemen in a bar . They are a bit exuberant , are n't they , after England ? The young men always seem so tired there . " " I expect it was the war , " Peter said . " Here we are . I 'm ravenous , as usual . " " You ai n't lonesome , Bud , " Nancy Deane said . " Those nutritious dee-licious little cucumber-and-tomato sandwiches you gave us at tea do not sufficiently sustain a large-type growing girl . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , indented on the right by shops which opened on the street , and turned left through a bricked patio to step down into a large formal dining room . A small orchestra played uninspired salon music in a palm-shaded corner . There was a loose knot of people drinking boisterously at the bar , which ran lightly along the room at the entrance but which was contained in a high balcony to fend the noise from the feeders . The people here seemed quieter , better dressed , and considerably older . But again the stamp was apparent . TheP197older men were either sallow from an ancient well-trusted malaria or they were heavy and beef-faced , with purpled cheeks from crisscrossed broken veins . But sallow or purple , the stain of sun overlaid the pallor or the flush . A tall and very correct Frenchified headwaiter bowed and led them to a large round table in a corner away from the orchestra , which was playing something from Strauss . " If the oysters are fresh , I can recommend them , " Peter said . " Fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I would indeed . The last I remember eating was at the party the day your sister and Jeff got married . What a party . You got beastly drunk , my lad , at a tender fifteen . You had to go and soak your head in the brook . " " I remember it all too well . It was my first hangover , and I also remember my old man did not give me what-for . I expect he was n't feeling well enough to make any special point of it . " " Your sister , she 's older or younger than you ? " Nancy asked , spearingan oyster . " My , but these are delicious . Tom 's always talking about Sydney oysters . He was in Australia during the last little bit of the war , and all he ever tells me about are the oysters . The other men who were in Australia wink and look wise and talk about the girls . " " Never went out with anything but oysters , " Tom said . " But tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , there 's Elisabeth and Pa and then there 's me , and that 's all . Lisa 's three years older than me . She 's married to a wonderful bloke  --  Navy type like you , Tom  --  who got blown up early in the war and rushed home early and grabbed Lisa off before the panic started . They 've got three kids , wonderful little brutes , and are quite the happiest people I know . Jeff 's made a lot of money on the farm . I suppose , actually , Jeff gets more work out of his Wogs than anybody around . " " This word Wog ' ? Where 's it come from ? I heard it during the war and always thought it was a short for pollywog . ' Do you think I could have another half dozen oysters ? They 're wonderful , but not very big , " Nancy asked . " I know about the derivation of Wog , " Holly said . " An R.A.F. chap told me in England . Seems that when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the 1914 war , a lot of it was stationed in Egypt . There was quite a lot of friction between the troops and the locals , so one day the C.O. put out a statement to all H.M. Forces in Egypt . The statement said something like : You will hereinafter ceasep198referring to our gallant allies as dirty , thieving coons . They will hereinafterbe referred to as Worthy Oriental Gentleman . ' Worthy Oriental Gentlemen  --  W.O.G.  --  Wog . " " I can believe it , " Peter said . " When I was up in Addis we had the same sort of directive . It said : You will hereinafter cease referring to the King Emperor , Haile Selassie , Lion of Judah , as that " little black bastard . " You may call him by his full title or not refer to him at all . ' So we called him Highly Delightful , ' out of respect for H.M. orders . Nobody could quarrel with us over that . " " This color thing interests me a lot , " Tom said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten very touchy about it at home . Your attitude out here reminds me very much of the way it works  --  or used to work  --  in the South . You sort of treat ' em as not too bright children . You like ' em , sure , but you do n't associate with ' em . You call everybody boy , ' whether they 're young or old . You have them in your homes and you depend on them entirely for the success of your work , but you treat them as if they were some special sort of cattle . What happens one fine day when they get tired of being called Boy-ee ! ' and want some of this easy democracy that 's being passed out all over the world today ? " " Jesus , I do n't want to get tangled up in this one , " Peter said . " Every American that comes out here asks me the same thing . In Kenya alone there are six million blacks . God knows how many more from the Cape to Cairo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came  --  less than fifty years ago  --  they were all eating each other and murdering each other for fun . Disease kept the population down and the lions kept the population down and the tribal wars kept them down . All the natural sins and troubles served as a sort of population check . Then we came roaring in and civilized ' em . I 'm talking now about the Kikuyu , the people that live in and around the White Highlands here . We threw ' em a pair of pants and said that over yonder was a church where a much stronger God than their Ngai lived . We introduced them to a little simple medicineand showed them how to keep their cattle from dying off and told them not to kill each other . We took land from the Masai and gave the Kikuyu the Masai land , and we told them to quit burning down the forests . Wait a minute , " Peter said , and turned his head . " Boy ! Letti soupi leo , hapana keshu ! " " That means ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup today instead of tomorrow . You send one of these chaps off to fetch your hat , maybe , and if he sees a butterflyp199he forgets the hat and chases the butterfly . You have to ginger ' em up a bit . Do you want to hear any more of this , or shall we talk about lions or sex or something ? " " It 'll probably bore Holly , but I 'd like to hear a bit more , " Nancy said . " Mind , Holly ? " " Not a bit . But I would like to say that we who 've been raised out here know just a bit more about the native than the people who have n't been raised out here . I used to get so damned sick of people in England , once they 'd heard I was East African , reading me long lectures on what we were doing wrong with the native . The only native they ever saw was a drunken American Negro G.I.  --  excuse me , both of you , I do n't mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarts and was busy showing London how a military uniform could turn into a zoot suit if you had the necessary money . " " Who reared me , Holly ? " Peter asked . " An African woman . " " Who was my best friend and playmate ? " " A Kikuyu . " " Who was my father 's best friend , really ? " " Old Karanja . A Kikuyu . " " And who took care of you as a little girl ? " " Africans . Swahili and Kikuyu . " " Right you are . Now you , Tom and Nancy , are going to trust your lives to me for three months . I have fifteen men in my outfit . More than once your life and mine may depend on whether Chalo and Kidogo and Metheke , the gunbearers , do their jobs right . You 've not met My , the cook , but next my father he 's the finest man I know , and a marvelous chef as well . The headboy , Yusuf , I expect , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver , is the best mechanic in Africa and one of the more decent chaps I ever knew , black or white . Right down to the kitchen mtoto , there 's not a man in my string I would n't trust with my life or yours , and there 's not a man in the string that I would n't expect to die for me in an emergency if he had to . " " I 'm pleased to hear about the cook , " Nancy Deane murmured . " I fancy me vittles . I think I will take the steak now if you recommend it . " " I ordered it for everybody , " Peter said . " Two rares , a medium , and one well done . I 'm the well done . The South African claret is n't half bad , it 's first-class , really . Would you try a bottle of that or prefer the French ? "  | " Try the local , " Tom Deane said . " Get on about the natives . I 'm fascinated . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wog , no matter what you do to him . Kungo 's a good mechanic , but if the truck breaks down under certainconditions , it is n't because he forgot to do something essential to preserve its innards . It 's a shauri a Mungu '  --  a will of God . Metheke 's a good Mohammedan , but he still files his teeth and prays to the old gods . Kidogo , in the bush after a wounded buffalo , does n't know the meaning of fear . But if somebody tells him that there 's a curse on him , he 'll lay right down and die on you . Fall sick and wither away . " I would trust Chalo to offer himself to a wounded lion if it would help me , and he would give the lion his arm to chew . But when I tell him to come back from Machakos at such-and-such a time , it 's apt to be a week later , or not at all , if there 's any difficulties on his shamba to distract him . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because if he does n't get somebody to read them , then I have n't sent them , see ? Yusuf , the headboy , is my complete Number One . He is a master of detail . He runs the shauri . But if an evil omen strikes him he goes potty and throws up his hands . He forgets he 's part Arab , and he forgets he 's a Mohammedan priest , and he turns right back to being black savage again . I think any one of them would run away , or kill me , or do anything at all , if they got scared enough in certain circumstances . " " My heavens , " Holly said . " You ought to go to England and do a lecture turn on the TV . " " Well , I want to get off the subject , " Peter said . " It really is a crashingbore . But what the people outside do n't know is that the Wogs do n't think like us , and they do n't react like us , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had a friend , an Australian , who was a wonderful white hunter , who quit and went back to Aussie because the blacks drove him literally loony . Frank never could handle them . The thing about the black is that you 've got to know when to kick him in the tail , when to humor him , and when to praise him . You ca n't stretch him beyond his basic powers , and you ca n't ever rely on him in white man 's terms . Just when you do , he 'll revert completely to his ancestors and do exactly the bloody opposite of what 's indicated . Seen it time and time again . " " Do n't get off the subject yet , " Tom Deane said . " We 've still got dessert and coffee coming . I gather that you think the problem out herep201is that you 've tried to civilize ' them , for want of a better term , too fast . " " You are so bloody crushingly correct , " Peter said . ' We leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the old ways , wearing their goatskins , moving their manyattas  --  that 's a Masai encampment  --  and , mind you , burning them down when they leave , so as to destroy germs . But we take the Kikuyu , say , or the Wakamba , and teach them how to increase their herds and how to increase themselves , but we do n't find any way to absorb them . We change their old crop rotation to money crops and ruin the land . They live bang on the fringe of white civilization , swelling and crowding their properties  --  and mark you , they 've got more land than they ever used before  --  but it is n't enough . They learn all our bad habits . We destroy every bit of their old logical living because it conflicts with our law , and replace it with bleeding nothing . So now you have , excuse me , please , whores when once there was no such thing as prostitution , and robbers and spivs and sly loafers , because they 've become detribalized without becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked this much before in my life . " " You seem to have given this quite a bit of thought , " Holly said . " I suppose it started with that business on your farm that I remember , the thing about Kimani spearing Jeff and old Karanja going to jail when they killed the baby . " " Yes , it did , but I do n't intend to go into that , " Peter said . " There will be a lot of dull nights ahead on safari to talk about that one . But why , please , would n't I give it some thought ? I just sacked a Kikuyu car boy , a born rogue if I ever knew one . Informed me politely the other day that he would n't have to be a car boy much longer . I asked him why , and he said the Russians were coming . He said when the Russians came all the natives in Africa would have a Chevrolet and a radio . Said it was common talk in the bazaars . And I promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a boot in the tail , which is exactly what I administered when I sacked him . " " The boot in the tail solves what ? " Tom Deane asked gently . " It salved my feelings for a start and brought this one particular idiot back to reality . The Russians are just around the corner , perhaps , but the boot in the tail is for right now , and an African understands right now . He does n't understand tomorrow , and he forgets yesterday , because he 's got no sense of time . Time means absolutely nothing to him . You 'll see a bloke curled up on a road waiting for a bus that isn'tp202due for half a week . He 's perfectly happy to sleep there in the dust . The best job you can give the average African is a waiting job . He needs starting to do anything at all specific , but he wo n't know when to stop if it 's white man 's orders . We had some Kavirondo on the farm once , the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and one damned well drowned . When the water came he was still carrying out orders , submerged or not . Boy ! Tasama bar steward ! I think that it will take at least a double brandy to wipe out the taste of my oration . " " Have you any more sweeping generalities to wash down with the brandy ? " Holly asked , smiling . " Just a couple , and then I either go on the wireless as an announcer or return to being a white hunter , " Peter said . " In the African make-up there is really no such thing as love , kindness , or gratitude , as we know it , because they have lived all their lives , and their ancestors ' lives , in an atmosphere of terror and violence . There is no proper love ' between man and woman , because the woman is bought for goats and is used as a beast of burden . There is no gratitude , because it would never occur to them to give anything to anybody else , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from others . They lie habitually , because to lie is the correct procedure , else some enemy might find a way to do them damage if they tell the truth . They have no sensitivity about inflictingpain or receiving pain , because their whole religion is based on blood and torture of animals and each other . They think , even the best of them , that nothing 's funnier than a wounded animal or a crippled animal . It 's a big joke . I do n't even think that they themselves feel pain the way we do . I 've seen ' em with their legs broken and the bones sticking out , and I 've seen Masai youngsters half eaten by lions . You sew ' em up with a sail needle and they grin like it was fine fun . I must say they 're good to their kids , as a rule , but maybe that 's because the female children represent a big annuity for the family , and the males are tomorrow 's warriors and day after tomorrow 's tribal elders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the black coffee-boy came with his wheeled tray . Holly poured the coffee . " One sugar , please , " Tom said . " You 'd say this applies to all the tribes , or just to these  --  what do you call them  --  Kyuku ? " " Kikuyu . Mostly the Kikuyu . For two reasons , mainly . They have a reputation amongst the other tribes as crafty , witch-hounded , lying sea lawyers . They were never proper warriors or hunters , but always shifty agriculturists and sneaky murderers , forever out to do the next bloke inp203the eye . Their system of land tenure is one of the most complicated in the world , and so is the tribal setup . " For instance , all the agitators like Kenyatta and the other boys that ran the old Kikuyu Central Association  --  which was banned for subversionat the start of the war  --  and its present successor , the Kenya African Union , are always screaming about us taking the Kikuyu land . Actually , where they scream the loudest , they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we gave ' em a new reservation  --  you 'll see it  --  and took up land for ourselves . " The land we actually got from the Kyukes we paid for . But then the agitators say that no one Kikuyu can sell any land at all to anybody , it 's a business for the clan , and then it gets to be the business of all the clans . The Kyukes do n't say much about the fact that they took most of what they call their own ground from a bunch of wild hunters named Wandrobo , first paying for it by agreement and then gradually forcing the ' Ndrobo out , like the camel that stuck his head in the tent . To understand the clan system you have to understand that every child is his own grandfather , which makes him the father of his father , and his uncle is his brother , and so forth , and it works the same way more or less on the female side . Everybody is everybody else , including his dead ancestor . ' Member , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main thing is that they fell smack in the path of our movements out here , so we 've had ' em for neighbors , and God knows we have n't helped them any . Now , by damn , I will stop . Somebody else talk . I never ran on before like this in my life . I 'm winded . " " I assume , then , " Nancy said , " that you actually like the individual Negro but only in certain categories , and always as an inferior ? " Peter looked up , almost but not quite angry . " They damned well are my inferiors in the white man 's world as we know it out here . I do n't mean to be rude , but you 've been in Nairobi only half a day . I admire a great many of their skills , and I love the true savage on his own savage ground , and I love a great many things about all the tribes . But I live here , I was raised here , and I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit in the Legislative Assembly . It 's a method of thinking for a start . They tried the equality thing once in a trial , letting the elders decide the guilt of a proven murderer . They 'd found the murderer literally pulling the spear out of the dead man . The elders acquitted him . They asked why for the acquittal and one elder said : It is well known that Kikuyu never murder . ' The next one said :  |p204The  accused owed me six goats . ' The third one said : The accused was my cousin . ' Now that is all . This is supposed to be a wet bright night in Nairobi . " " My apologies for Nancy , " Tom Deane said . " But she took a couple courses of sociology in her senior year in college . Somebody told her sociology courses had no labs . " " Well , I 'm curious , " Nancy said . " I do n't see any point in coming all the way out here without asking some questions . " " Buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry I was B-minded . " " Eland straps ? " " Sure . When a Wog loves his manamouki very much , he gets her some eland straps as a token of affection . " " What is a manamouki exactly ? And this business of eland straps , whatever they are ? " " Well , a manamouki is the best word for female in Swahili . It means she-thing . ' Whether it applies to animal or human , that is what a shethingis called , ' manamouki . ' There is n't any word for sweetheart or fiancee or debutante or wife or loved one . It 's just manamouki . And when you care for your manamouki very much , you buy her some eland straps  --  very strong and supple , from the skin of the big antelope  --  so that she can carry more firewood and potato tops and banana fronds . This way you know the man loves you , because it pains him to think that you 've got to make two trips up that long hill , when with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one trip . " Peter grinned evilly . " I think one more brandy and then we 'll abandon this dreary monologue of mine for a little more frivolous evening amongst the drunks at the Equator . All the manamouki you see there never heard of an eland strap . It 's all they can do to lift their whisky glasses . " " What a magnificently nasty young man you 've become , Peter McKenzie , " Holly said . " I think I liked you better when you were a thousand Masai moran up from the Loita , on rape and robbery bent , as the poet says . " " It comes of too much association with clients , " Peter replied , soothing the sting with a smile . " They come out here in a hurry from a wet night in Harlem or someplace and try to uplift the pore bleedin ' ' eathen before they 've got their safari clothes delivered . Just you people wait "  --  he pointed a spoon at Tom and Nancy Deane  --  " until you 've seen the pore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just after he 's mucked up your best blouse because he forgot that fire'sp205hot , even if there 's an iron to hold it . Now , if everybody 's quite through , I say a spot of noisy nonsense at the old Equate . The band 's not bad . Mostly Greeks from Tanganyika . Off , no ? " " This was , by all odds , one of the windiest dinners I ever had , " I lolly said as she rose from the chair . " What a bore you must be in the bush , Peter , if you carry on this way in town . " " In the bush , " Peter said , " I am the perfect prototype of the Stewie Granger version of the noble white hunter . I do n't talk in the daytime , nor allow others to talk . I am taciturn . I am a man with a secret sorrow . 1 dye my burnsides white . I drown me troubles in drink at night 's fall and speak only of muzzle velocities and bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm so bloody unnatural , but the clients expect it . " " Well , I enjoyed it , anyhow , " Nancy said . " If you can do a rumba as well as you generalize , I am sure we will have a most athletic eve-ning . " " Leave the poor man the hell alone , " Tom said . " You paid this , Peter ? Then the Equator 's mine . Let 's go and investigate the sociological aspects of Nairobi night life . They tell me it 's much tougher than elephanthunting . " " As a young Canadian client of mine said to me last year , Chum , you ai n't home yet . ' There are more horns and tusks awaiting the innocentbwana wa safari in the Equator Club than ever were seen in the bush . Let us kwenda ourselves away from civilization and go observe life as she is lived in the raw . " The Equator Club was roaring when they got there . It is a restaurant-cabaret , ostensibly private , which is reachable by two flights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plush serves not so much as decoration as a soft cushion for the exuberants who fall , are pushed , or are knocked down the stairs any time after r A.M. The cashier is a dour lady and the maitre d'hotel a thoroughly maitre d'hotel type . The band plays mostly rumbas and sambas , occasionally on beat and in tune . There is a bar to one side , foggy with smoke and usually packed sixdeep . Food is served at tables round the dance floor and is very expensive for anywhere . On Saturday nights a black tie is obligatory , but most Kenyans having a night out prefer to dress . There is a second bar and a pleasant terrace up another flight , when the samba beat and the shouts of the celebrants become too much to bear any longer . Peter signed in his guests and they fought their way to a table inp206a corner , being fairly severely wounded in the process . Peter ordered a bottle of whisky and a siphon , a bowl of ice and some cigarettes , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were mostly the young men of the Norfolk bar , changed now to white jackets and boiled shirts , and the women wore long skirts with bare shoulders . They were dancing the samba with a singleness of purpose that is nearly indescribableunless one has seen the English doing the samba . The Kenya versionof an Englishman doing the samba is roughly as if someone had gotten a covey of kangaroos drunk and penned them all in the same room . Now they leaped , they bounded , they kicked , they bobbed , they jumped up and down in one place and wiggled in the unlikeliest sectionsof their anatomy . " I do n't know how the poor girls survive it , " Holly murmured . " Do they always dance like this out here now , Peter ? " " This is tame . I was at a hunt ball at the Limuru Club last year , and they all had on red coats . They were packed as thick as flies on a Somali donkey . They were leaping up and down in a solid mass . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a griddle . I was crouched back in a corner , hoping not to get killed in the stampede , and I looked around me at the servants . They all had on red jackets over their kanzus , and they were leaping and bobbing to the music too  --  doingthe war dances . I swear to God , if you had painted the black faces white or the white faces black , you could n't tell the difference between a samba and a Masai ngoma . Frightful experience . I 'd rather go into the bush after a sick buffalo any day . " " I thought all you white hunters were fancy dancing men who break the ladies ' hearts on the dancing floor as well as out under the stars in trackless , romantic Africa , " Holly teased . " Do n't you dance ? " " Sure , I dance . I dance a fox trot and a waltz and I can do a rumba if the music 's right , but you do n't catch me out there jumping up and down like Masai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I got too much dignity to do a samba . Also , I 'm afraid somebody 'll break my leg . Oh , they 're stopping now . If the next thing 's civilized , after they 've cleared away the dead bodies will you do me the honor , Holly ? " " Love to . This seems to be a fox trot . Let 's try this one . " Tom and Nancy got up and passed ahead of Peter and Holly to the dance floor , which had cleared considerably . Peter took Holly in his arms and looked down at her . She was a very tall girl , but her amazing greenp207eyes came only to a level with his chin . Her hair was alive in the candlelight , and little sparks of light seemed to dance on it . She was wearing a simple black gown , cut square and low in front , with no shoulders whatsoever . She smelled faintly of some perfume that Peter could n't identify , although he knew names like Chanel and Tabu and Shocking from dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a damp spring night in the Masai when the mimosas were in bloom and a careless puff of air suddenly carried the odor faintly to your tent when you lay in bed after a hard day , deliciously weary but not yet asleep . She smiled up at him , and Peter smiled back . She felt amazingly pliant but very soft under his fingers . She danced as lightly as a puffball skips before the wind on the plain . " I 've not had a chance , really , to say anything to you at all today , " Peter said . " There 's not much to say except that I am awfully glad you 're back and that you are the most beautiful girl I have ever seen , and I hope you never go away again . Little Holly Keith from the farm next door . Whoever would have thought it ? " " That 's a very pretty speech , sir , and delivered with the assurance that comes with a lot of practice . I suppose you have had a lot of prac-tice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm in the bush ten months a year . The women I meet are either all old or all married . Most of them come to Africa and fall in love with the hunter a little bit because of what they 've read and what they 've been led to believe from the films , but I learned a long time ago from old Dan that romance and safari do n't mix , especially when the woman belongs to somebody else . Not little Peter . I smarm ' em , sure , because that 's a part of the job . " " I must say you dance extremely well , like an American . You do n't hop and crawl sideways . " " I should dance like an American . Americans taught me . Lots of times I talk like an American , too , especially after a couple of weeks or months in the bush with them . " " I must say you amaze me a little . That long oration over dinner . Right or wrong , it had some thought in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bother the oration . But mind you , when I am working at my job there is an awful lot of time to think . I do n't talk when I hunt . I talk at lunch and I talk at dinner , but from the time we leave camp until thep208time we get back , I do n't open my mouth . So you think . You get twelve full hours a day to think in . Speaking of dancing , you 're a wizard your-self . " " It 's part of my job too . " " What job ? " " Oh , just being a girl . There are as many tricks to it as hunting buffalo . Little things . What to do with what you 've got . What to wear with your certain kind of color . Little flatteries . The right perfume . Tricks with the eyelashes . All tricks . " " I must say you seem to have mastered the lot . What do you plan to do now you 're back ? Work in town ? Get married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very serious girl . It was fun growing up in London , and fun seeing Europe , and the parties were fine , and some of the people were nice , but it 's not for me . There is something sort of sad and sick in the cities that I do n't like a bit . Everybody running about and dashingmadly and complaining and frightened . Everything rationed and controlled . Every day a new set of crises in the newspapers . Politicians screaming and cursing , and television blatting at you . People always gettingmarried and divorced in the same year . Half the men are pansies and the other half think that because they are n't pansies every woman they meet is panting to hop into bed with them , and they 're not so far wrong at that . It sort of made me sick to my stomach . I used to wake up in the middle of the night and think about how the Rift looks just as you go down the hill toward Naivasha , and I could n't help but cry . All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mum and Dad and the baby and just sort of sit quietly . And someday I hope to find a chap like Lisa 's Jeff , say , a chap who loves me , and then I want to get married and have as many kids as we can afford . My , that was quite a speech , was n't it ? " " Seems to be the evening for it . The music appears to have stopped . We 'll go back and then I 'll do my duty by my pretty client . " " Pleasant duty , I should think . She seems extremely nice . " " So does he . I think this might be one of the good ones . Thirsty work , dancing . I can use a drink . " They sat down . Tom and Nancy were already placed and had mixed the drinks . " Dearie me , " Nancy said . " That must have been quite a conversation . You danced for a full half minute after the music stopped . I must say you looked divine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safelyp209married woman , I must say that when I saw what sunburn and a white dinner jacket can do for a man I loathed Deane here , rich as he be . By you he looks anemic . " " Wait 'll you see him a month from now . " Peter grinned . " You 'll have to fight the women off him . They 'll be signing him up to do the Tarzan part on the films . " " This ai n't a bad little joint , " Tom said . " I cast my wicked eye around , and some of these local wenches seem right tasty . I also saw the two hostesses we flew out with in the bar with the pilot and flight engineer . One of the girls keeps looking at Peter , and I have a hunch that she more or less expected to be sitting at this table tonight . Or am 1 being nasty and suspicious ? " " Actually , you may be right . I love those kids , all of them . They 're my kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live a funny sort of disordered life , like mine , and they play hard when they 're on the ground . Most of ' em get married to pilots or occasionally to passengers , eventually , but while they 're footloose they really try to pack it in during their two days on the ground . I most always meet them at the airport and cart ' em back out again when they leave . " " I suppose they 're all crazy-mad in love with you , " Nancy said . " I saw that one little girl looking daggers at Holly when you danced . " " Nothing of the sort . We 're just good friends . If you do n't mind , later on I 'd like to ask the four over for a drink . Maybe in my cott -- But it occurs to me I have n't got a cottage now . This woman 's ousted me . " Oh , I 'm broad-minded , " Holly said . " I 'll lend it back to you for a nightcap for your friends . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom said . " It 's bigger . And I 've got an ocean of booze that this amazing woman of mine seems to have smuggled in . " He winked at Peter , and Nancy blushed . The music began again and Tom reached out a hand to Holly . Peter nodded at Nancy , and they danced : It was a waltz , and a dangerousone , because a Kenyan waltzing is only slightly less dangerous than abull elephant in the musth season . The glides become ski jumps , andthe twirls are cyclones . It is not uncommon in the Equator Club for aman and partner to overshoot a glide and wind up in the bass drum . " You do this very well , " Nancy said from about halfway up Peter'schest , where her head was snuggled . " I ca n't get over you . I still thinkyou 're a fraud , and no white hunter at all . Where are your whiskers ?  |p210You  got no business waltzing in a dinner jacket . Where are your lions ? Where is the woman who ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death daily with a grim smile ? " Glowed if I know . I reckon I 'm operating under false pretenses . Where is your chewing gum ? All Americans chew gum . Why do n't you start all sentences with Say ' and call us ' youse guys ' ? I 'm told all Americansdo . " " That is quite a girl , this little grown-up neighbor of yours . I think she is quite the best-looking girl I ever saw , and that from another woman is an extreme compliment . And she is nice , and smart , and quiet , too . What are your plans for her ? " " I think I 'll marry her , " Peter said , smiling . " I think you 're serious , too , " Nancy said . " I think you 're a damned fool if you do n't . If she 'll have you . I would n't marry a white hunter any more than I 'd marry a sailor . I want my man home with me where I can get some use out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I 'm going too , snakes or no snakes in the bed . I do n't suppose you know I 'm frightened silly ? " " Mostly they are , at first . And then they either love it and want to come back next year , or they make everybody so miserable they break up the trip . I think you 'll want to come back next year . I think you 're the type . " " I suppose that 's a compliment . Let 's do that little twirl again . It 's cute . " Tom and Holly were dancing at the other end of the room . Tom bent his head and held her a little away from his body . " That 's quite a boy you 've got there , " he said . " What do you aim to do about him ? " " Marry him , I think . It 's what I came home for , anyhow . At least to have another look at him , now we 're grown . He seems to have come along nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , not having known him until this afternoon , that he is quite a hunk of man . But how 'll you like being a safari widow nine-ten months a year ? " " There wo n't be any of that , " Holly said . " Peter 's got a fine farm . His father 's getting old . When  --  or if  --  I get married to anybody , it 's not going to be one of these he's-there , I'm-here sort of things . You do n't get married to live by yourself . " " I think you might have quite a difficult time persuading this onep211to quit the thing he loves to wet-nurse a lot of cows , " Tom said . " This lad 's at the top of a heap in what I suspect is a very exciting business . I read a piece about him in the Saturday Evening Post or somewhere , and from all accounts he 's Paul Bunyan in a quiet sort of way . I did n't even know I was getting the same guy until the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation anyhow , seeing as how I 'm back home less than one day , and for all I know , Peter has squadrons of women panting to marry him . Little girls that grow up next door lack a certain amount of mystery . I can remember plainly some ants getting into my clothes once and Peter stripping me completely naked and smearing me all over with mud . Not much glamor there . " " That , my girl , was yesterday , " Tom said . " Thanks for a lovely dance . Let 's go back to the bottle , my athletic days are done , and that red-faced gentleman with the fiery mustaches just wounded me permanentlywith his last swoop . " Shortly thereafter the two hostesses and the two flying types came over . The pilot was a lean , clipped-mustached ex-R.A.F.er with a double row of good ribbons . His name was Michael Something-Something . The flight engineer was named Ralph , and he was a beefy man with a red face and a long , curling blond mustache . He was quite drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hostesses , in or out of uniform  --  clean , healthy , neat , competent , and a little buxom . They had a couple of drinks , and Peter danced with each of the girls , as did Tom , while Michael and Ralph steered Holly and Nancy around the floor , which had now achieved a solid concentration of strugglers . It was gettinghotter by the moment as the newcomers used up the oxygen . The shouts from the bar were so loud that the band could barely be heard ; in its way , a singular blessing . The smoke eddied in long plumes , and there was a short but determined fist fight in the hallway . " This is really horrible , " Peter said to Holly as they struggled off the dance floor . " Let 's go over to the Norfolk and have a quiet , cool one on the veranda of yours or Tom 's cottage . I can stand just so much of this and then I want out . " " I could n't agree more , " Holly said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure the Deanes would like to pack in , and I do n't like the way that Ralph person holds me when he dances . I hate being sort of pawed on a dance floor . Or anywhere else , for that matter . Let 's go . Now . " The stewardesses , Ruth and Pamela , said they thought they 'd go back too , and Michael and Ralph said they 'd had it as well . They paidp212up and went down the long narrow stairway into the chilly night , and when they returned the hotel was nearly dark . Peter drew up in front of the Deanes ' cottage , and Tom said : " That nightcap . Let 's have it on the porch . It 's nice out . Run over to your cottage and get a wrap , Holly , while I organize a little ice from the night watchman . " " Fine . I 'm not sleepy or tired any more . I expect it 's the excitement of getting home . Walk with me , Peter . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they returned from Holly 's cottage with a wrap , the flying types and the hostesses had arrived also in a creaky taxi and were sitting on the steps of Tom 's cottage . " Hullo once more , " the girl Pamela said . " We were passing by and Mr. Deane asked us for a drink . That Equator Club . I should think another hour of it might 've given me smoke poisoning . " The engineer just grunted . He appeared to be slowly simmering over something and had had enough drink to thicken his speech . He accepted his glass from Tom Deane and then turned his back on Peter . More than mildly exhilarated by the drinks , the cold clarity of the starry night , and his actual presence in Africa , Tom Deane continued to hammer Peter with questions . " What 's the most dangerous stuff , do you reckon ? Lions , elephants , or what ? " " Well , it can all kill you if you 're careless , " Peter said . " But unless there is some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of it 's dangerous . I promise you , you may see me doing something with buffalo or elephants that 'll strike you as the sheerest idiocy , and there 's generally a good reason for it or I would n't do it . " " Then what 's all this I read about wounded buffalo and wounded lions killing people ? " " That 's it . They 've been wounded . The thing is not to wound it . There 's no animal in the world that wo n't run away from man unless he 's wounded , insane , is crowded into a corner , or has babies . An old gentleman rhino will charge you if you stumble on him , but that 's because he 's frightened and rushes on from reflex . He ca n't see very well , d' you see , and so he runs toward the noise . Actually all he 's trying to do is get away . " " Buffalo ? I 've heard them called the most dangerous . " " Again , only when it 's hurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he turns nasty . He 'll try to kill you as long as there 's the breath of life in him . The only thing I know that 'll charge without provocationfrom a long distance is an old elephant with ants up his snout or a bull in the breeding season or some cantankerous old cow with a new calf . But if you leave it alone it 'll leave you alone , likely . " " Are n't you ever frightened ? " Nancy asked . " How 's your drink ? " " Just fine . Sure I 'm frightened . I 'm always frightened . I 'm frightenedwhen I 'm crawling around in the bush after some leopard somebody'sjust wounded . I 'm scared green when I have to go into thick bush after a sick rhino . I 'm always frightened when I 'm very close to elephants , because you can never tell what they 're going to do or when they 'll decide to do it . It 's good business to be frightened . You stay alive longer . " The flight engineer turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the clients ' women ? Are you frightened of them as well ? " " Desperately . All women frighten me . Especially other people 's women . Bloke gets shot that way . " " You do n't have to be frightened of me , my friend . " Nancy laughed . " If it was romance I sought , I 'd go to Capri . All I want you to do is keep us alive and beat off the snakes . " " You wo n't be bothered with snakes . They do n't hang around the high country much . If you see ' em at all it 's apt to be on the roads . They love to wriggle along in the warm dust . " " Is there anything you do n't know about this business ? " Ralph , the engineer , was being markedly offensive . " Heaps . I learn something new every time out . The day you stop learning is the day you get trod on . " Peter was being as deliberately pleasant . " So this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The engineer swung his head back and forth in a mock amazement . " The Peter McKenzie , the one all the little girls on the big planes talk about . Now I can really say I 've lived . It 'll be something to tell my grandkiddies , that one night in Nairobi when I actually met the Peter McKenzie . They 'll be impressed no end , I can tell you . I 've actually met the famous McKenzie , the handsome hunter , the romantic lion shooter . " The sarcastic edge to his voice now was blurred burlesque . " Nothing to it , " Peter said mildly . " Never shoot anything . Just a hired hand . A chauffeur , greasy mechanic , and general handyman . " " I 've heard all about you chaps . Go out in the parks and **25;9267;TOOLONG a head for business , too . When the depression hit her hard , she launched out on many more careers than the Unforgettable Character and , one way or another , she saved us , too . The month of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Auntie Manic chose for her painful interview at the bank was a scorcher . She cane home , dropped her fox furs in the middle of the living room , called for a stiff drink , and wilted tragically onto her new " modernistic " sofa . " Patrick , " she said hollowly , " your Auntie Manic is a poor woman . Ruined , ruined , ruined ! " She gazed soulfully out into the street and tried to work up some tears . " I am , " she said dramatically , " little more than a pauper . " Auntie Mame had forsaken her expensive duplex and installedherself in a neat little carriage house on Murray Hill . She had furnished the place throughout , had bought a lot of new , longer clothes , and had given a couple of parties to warm the house and rally what was left of her Old Set . Then she began to realize that living cost money  --  even in 1930 , when things were cheap . But money in general was scarce , and Auntie Mame 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been made crystal clear that after her violent flirtationwith the stock market and her Babylonian expenditures , she had exactly four thousand dollars in cash and the snug little annuity of two hundred dollars a month . " Oh , to think that I should bear the yoke of poverty after scrimping and saving for all these years . " " ' That 's a shame , Auntie Manic , " I said , and snickered because it rhymed . She cast me a cold glance . " Oh , it 's all very well for you to laugh  --  a mere boy of eleven with a big inheritance tied up so that nobody can get at it  --  when your poor Auntie Mame is practically ready for the Peabody Home , but how are we to live on a lousy two hundred bucks a month ? " In 1930 two hundred dollars seemed a fortune to literally41millions of people . Actually , with a few simple economics she could have gotten along fine . " Well , " she said with a dolorous sigh , " I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go to work simply to lteep you in that wretched St. Boniface school . " I knew that the Trust Company paid my tuition , but it seemed wiser not to say so . " But then , " she continued , " God knows I 've worked and slaved all my life , so I should be used to it . " This was not strictly true , either . For a period of nearly six ' weeks my Auntie Mame had danced in the chorus of a road companyof Chu Chin Chow until my father heard about it and family pressure was brought to bear . Since then she 'd never turned a hand at more than mixing her famous homemade gin . " Yes , that 's the answer . Your poor Auntie Manic will have to ' go back to work  --  try to find a job with millions unemployed already  --  inorder to keep clothes on our backs : nul the wolf from the door . But do n't fret , my little love , Auntie Maine will find a way , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the classified advertising section of the New York Times . The next day Auntie Mame had her usual one o'clock Little Morning Chat . Shc was surrounded by pads of yellow paper with lists of names written on them . " Giving a party ? " I asked . " Certainly not ! " Auntie Manic snapped . " Oh , well , maybe after I get established in business 1 ' 11 have a little celebration , but these people are all valuable contacts  --  friends of mine who are well placed . " She rattled the New York Times contemptuously . " All these jobs here in the want ads , they 're nothing I 'd be interested in ; waitresses , salesgirls , factory hands , stenographers  --  nothing I could really sink my teeth into . No , darling , it is n't what you know that gets you places in this town , it 's who you know . And God knows , I have connections . Why , " she said , " there are probably any number of organizations in New York that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the market . So I 've just made up a list of influential friends and I 'm going to make them aware of my interest . " 42Auntie Mame made a lot of long and vivacious telephone calls that day . The first was to her old broker , Florian McDermott . She told him the whole story of her financial downfall , although it seemed unnecessary to be so explicit with the man who was largely responsible for it . She asked Florian if his brokerage house would be interested in a businesswoman accustomed to handling large sums of money . But he said hastily that they were Cutting Down , and managed to sell her a couple of hundred shares of a stock that was Absolutely Foolproof . Two months later Florian was sharing a cell with all illustrious broker whom he never could have hoped to know socially before . All of her other financial friends were retrenching , too , so Auntie Mame decided that her future lay in the Arts . The following day she had lunch with Frank Crowninshield and came home jubilant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The salary was forty dollars a week  --  exactly what she paid Norah and Ito  --  but she knew she 'd Forge Ahead . She ordered a lot of smart little businesslike suits and some new hats to wear around the magazine office . I was packed off for St. Boniface Academy and Auntie Mame commenced her business career . During the fall of 1930 , I had only Auntie Mame 's letters to give inc a dramatic  --  if somewhat prejudiced  --  picture of her various professional endeavors . The job at Vanity Fair lasted a month . Then Mr. Crowninshield and Mr. Nast took her to lunch again and said that her writing was too inaccurate , albeit spirited , and they were reducing the staff anyway . As a consolation prize they ran a full-page photograph of her in a three-hundred-dollar Jeanne I Ai win evening dress , which she bought with her severance pay and some money she 'd won on a race horse . Mr. Crowninshieldsaid that she was too attractive a woman to be running around loose and she really ought to marry and settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't last quite so long . She became a reader for I loracc Liveright 's publishing company . Mr. Liveright was an old acquaintance , and although he and Auntie Mame had had their little differences , they respected one43another 's intellects . However , Auntie Mame went out for a gay evening carrying with her the only copy of a thrilling manuscript that reeked of whale blubber and was written by a Danish explorer . Somewhere between Jack Delaney 's and the Cotton Club the manuscript was lost . There were a lawsuit and harsh words betweenAuntie Marne and Mr. Liveright . A year later an up-andcominglittle firm published the rewritten book and it sold more than a hundred thousand copies and was turned into a solemnly successful documentary film . After that Auntie Mame always said she could smell a bestseller . Still undaunted , Auntie Mame moved into another branch of the Arts  --  interior decoration . Nobody could deny that she had taste , though sometimes a little bizarre . However , Auntie Mame possessed certain qualities that are important in commercial decorating : she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew a lot of influential people . So it was only logical that Auntie Mame would drift into the rococo atelier of Elsie de Wolfe and her jolly helpers . With what she called her Following and a lot of glib talk about the Regency and the Directoirc , she landed a job that paid not only a good salary , but a generous commission as well . But conversantas she was with the decorative arts of France , Auntie Mame 's heart was more with the Bauhaus of Munich than with the rocaille and coquaille of Versailles . For a time , however , she was able to fight down her progressive impulses and string along with the staff at Elsie de Wolfe 's , chirping prettily over dim ormolu wall sconces and inaccurate cupid clocks . Under the watchful eye of a supervisor , Auntie Mame did over an entrance foyer on Fifth Avenue , a dining room in Oyster Bay , and a boudoir in Gracie Square , all in the style of Louis XV . Then , as a solo flight , she decorated her friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prud'hon with a lot of old Empire junk she 'd unearthed on Avenue A. The rooms and their tenant were duly photographed by Home Beautiful , Miss de Wolfe wrote Auntie Mame a glowing letter , and her44Empire rooms were in wild demand among bootleggers , who were the only people who could afford any expensive old furniture . At first she seemed a little stunned by her heady triumphs , but after pulling off three or four Napoleonic apartments on Central Park West , Auntie Manic grew bored with caryatids and columns and got that old modern itch again . Aesthetically it showed progress , but financially it was disaster . Auntie Maine 's big chance arrived in the autumn , when she came to the attention of a Mrs. Riemenschneider of Milwaukee , whose late husband had worked wonders in the near-beer business . Too big , at last , for Milwaukee , Mrs. Riemenschneider had set her heart on New York and on a social position that only a lot of money and the things that go with it over three or four generationscan obtain . But Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations . It was a buyer 's market in 1930 and she had plenty of cash to pay her own way . She had n't been in New York for more than a few hours before she 'd bought an elegant little town house in the East Sixties and handed Auntie Maine a crisp check for one hundred thousand dollars to decorate it " like Fountain-blow . " Then she was off to Paris for clothes , having extracted from Auntie Mame the promise that her house would be finished by Christmas . The house was finished by Christmas and so was Auntie Maine . The pull of Munich modern had been too strong  --  almost as strong as Mrs. Ricmcnschncider 's language when she returned to find that her prim mansion had had its marble facade removed , most of its walls knocked down , and was filled with the most advancedstainless steel furniture , wire sculpture , and cubist art that money or imagination could create . Just before her return to Milwaukee , Mrs. Ricnicnsclincider got out an injunction against the decorating firm not only for her hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The papers got hold of the story and had a big time with it . Alliterations like " atheist art " and " Bolshevik barbarism " and " maniac modern " were bandied about the yellow press for days. 45Auntie Mame was christened " Madcap Mame " by an inspired headline writer , and two columnists wrote articles that began " What can Picasso paint that my boy in the fourth grade ca n't paint better ? " Auntie Mame was purged from Elsie de Wolfe 's . Although angry and humiliated by what she called the ignoranceof the masses , Auntie Mange still was n't ready to give up her crusade for the ultramodern . She 'd picked up a few allies during the fray , one of them a brooding young sculptor named Orville who had his own potter 's wheel and did " the most excitingceramics . " So Auntie Mame decided to take her capital and go into partnership with him . They were going to open a gift shop " devoted to the Brave , the Experimental , the Exciting , the New , the Modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling , " she wrote , " it 's going to be unlike any shop in New York . Just you wait and sec . We 'll set New York on fire ! " Maison Moderne , as the establishment was called , was unlike any shop in New York  --  or at least any 1 'd ever seen . It was located in a row of elderly brownstones on East Fifty-fourth Street . It had a big amoeba-shaped show window and a circular chartreuse door . Its walls were an uncompromising red-violet lighted with a tortured tangle of neon tubing , and it was filled with some of the queerest looking ash trays , plates , ceramic pins , and things Auntie Mame called objets d'art . Maison Moderne opened on the day I came home for Christmas vacation and it attracted throngs of people . But most of them , after the initial shock , said they were just looking . Auntie Marne was in her element , bustling around in a gay smock with a cigarette dangling from the corner of her mouth . The first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and got a lot of coverage from the press . But Auntie Mame did n't seem to mind any of the mean things they wrote . " That 's the value of publicity , my little love . I could n't have bought all that newspaper space for fifty thousand dollars . Did you see how gorgeously Orville 's foetus sandwich platter47 " Oh , Patrick , what has Fate done to me , " Auntie Manic sniffled . " My whole brave , new endeavor gone up in a puff of smoke . Well , thank God I mailed the premium for the fire insurancelast week . " She blew her nose daintily . " Damn it , " she snapped , reaching into an empty crystal box , " there is n't a cigarette in this house . Reach me my bag , will you , there 's a pet . " Still chattering animatedly , she lirrowed through her lizard purse . Suddenly she was still ; her face went white . " Oh , no ! " she whispered . Then from her bag Auntie Mane withdrew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ InsuranceCompany of Hartford , Connecticut . After the expensive demise of Maison Moderne , Auntie Marne decided that it was better to work for other people , after all . In those days her passion for exotic fabrics led llcr to buy most of her clothes at Jessie Franklin Turner 's . It was a shop of mediumsizedproportions devoted to a clientele of large-sized income . " So pleasant and intime , " Auntie Marne said in one of her letters , " almost as though the customers were old friends and guests  --  which , of course , they are . " Owing to Auntie Mame 's bill , Mrs. Turner took her on as a saleswoman  --  " really a vendeuse , darling , " she wrote . Auntie Mame loved working among the beautiful , costly clothes and came home nearly every evening with some new Jessie FranklinTurner creation . Business was terrible in the winter of 1931 , but Auntie Marne had a lot of confidence in herself . However , my aunt possessed an unfortunate candor that delightedmany but offended just as many others . Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overheard her saying to a volatile matron of formidable proportions , " But , my dear , we have n't a thing we could get onto you . All of our clothes are wrong for you  --  much too svelte . Now , take my advice and run down to the Stylish Stout section at Lane Bryant 's . " There were heated words and the customer stalked out , never to return . Fifteen minutes later Auntie Mame did , too , after an46photographed in the American ? It 's all free advertising , darling . The time to worry is n't when they 're talking about you . It 's when they 're not talking about you . " Maybe she was right , for the next day the crowds were still thicker . Auntie Marne raced among customers twittering like a debauched canary , and she sent me out twice for coffee and three times for Melachrino cigarettes . Around one o'clock the crowds got so heavy and the sales so brisk that she had to send for Norah to tend the cash register , while I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excelsior , wrapping up Auntie Mame 's outrageous ceramics . Whatever you said about Maison Moderne , it did attractpublic notice . It was after six when Auntie Marne finally shooed the last customer out and collapsed into the pile of excelsior in the back room . " Oh ! Success , success , success ! " she caroled . " Give me a cigarette , darling , Auntie 's simply exhausted ! " She stretched luxuriouslyand exhaled a cloud of smoke . " How much do you supposewe took in today , Norah , a hundred ? " " Oh , more than that , " Norah said beaming . " Five , six , seven hundred , I 'd say . " " But how divine ! " Auntie Mame cried . She took another ecstaticpuff of her cigarette and then sat bolt upright . " My God , I promised Ncysa McMein I 'd have cocktails with her and I 'm already hours late ! Gracious , she 's promised to do some designs for us and I 've forgotten all about it . Here , child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must dash ! " " What 'll I do with all this money ? " Norah asked . " Just leave it iii the cash register . I 'll lock up . Goodness , get a taxi , Patrick , I 'll drop you both at the house . " She locked the door , and we all raced away . That night what the tabloids described as " a holocaust of unknownorigin " destroyed nearly half the block on East Fifty-fourth Street . It took three fire companies to extinguish the blaze and there was n't enough left of Maison Moderne to put in one of its Exciting ash trays. interchange with Mrs. Turner , who warned her that she 'd better find a rich husband  --  fast  --  to pay the bill she 'd run up . Auntie Mamc 's last stop in the garment industry was at Henri Bendel 's , where , thanks to a beautiful figure and a long friendship with Mr. Bendel , she modeled tea gowns for just over a week . But on the day her elegant posterior was pinched by a dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly contretemps and her services were dispensed with . Mr. Bendel wrote Auntie Manic a touching letter , saying that he felt terrible about the whole thing , but that she was , after all , a Lady and too fine a woman to be a mere clotheshorse . I lc also added that the best career for Auntie Mame would be marriage . Still Auntie Mame was eager to prove that she could hold her own in a man 's world . One night at Twenty-one she met an eager young man from a fine old Baltimore family who had capital to invest in a small but select speak-easy . Since he knew almost nobody in New York , and since Auntie Mame knew everyone , he persuaded her to become the social hostess of his new venture . Auntie Mame was a little dubious at first , but she needed money badly , and after all , as she wrote , the place would be " not just some sordid little ginmill , but really an exclusive club with a carefully chosen membership , where ladies and gentlemen may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a rubber or two of bridge . A service , really . " Together they found an old mansion in the Forties that was already equipped for just their sort of venture . Within the last two years it had been called Tony 's , Belle 's Bar Sinister , The Ole Plantation , ' I'onv 's , Alt Wicn , Paris Soir  --  or Sewer  --  Victor 's Vesuvius , Clcez Cocotte , York House , Gay Madrid , and Tony 's . However , Auntie Maine and the young man had the place re- painted , christened it the Club Continentale , and were ready for business . Everyone who got a chance to visit the place said that Auntie Mame and the young Baltimore gentleman had done things ever so nicely . They sent out engraved invitations and membership cards to the best people in the Social Register and the Arts . They hired one of New York 's most popular bartenders , a French chef , a Hungarian orchestra , an Irish doorman , an Italian headwaiter , and a Spanish dancer named something like Euthanasia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing , if called upon , to tinkle away at the white piano and sing some light French airs . But she never got a chance . In their eagerness to do everything Right , Auntie Mame and the young man had overlooked paying out protection money to the cops . On the night of the Grand Opening things were just reaching their pitch of brilliant gentility when the Club Continentale was raided , the bottles and decorations smashed with axes , and Auntie Mame and her carefully chosen membership were taken off in the paddy wagon . Next , through the kindness of Frank Case , Auntie Mame started a personal shopping service as a convenience to guests at the Algonquin . But the Algonquin was n't having many guests in 1931 , and those it did have found Auntie Manic 's taste a little too extreme and a lot too expensive . So she passed most of that spring chatting with old friends in the lounge . Shc had to sell her pearls and a star sapphire ring to keep out of debt , and when I got home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit among the potted palms of the Algonquin any longer . After that she tried to peddle aluminum kitchenware from door to door on Riverside Drive but no one bought any , and on the day the sales manager tried to seduce her , she slapped his face and got fired . In July she was the secretary to a shoestring producer  --  she did n't know shorthand but she could write fast and peck out rather casual-looking letters on the typewriter . But after three weeks he had produced nothing , including a pay check . In August Auntie Mame wrote a Greek drama in thirty scenes with a chorus of two hundred voices . She took it to Annie Laurie50Williams , the agent , who said it had some pretty good stuff in it , but somehow it never got produced . One morning in September Auntie Manic , after a lot of lying , was a switchboard operator for an insurance company . She nearly electrocuted herself and was home in time for lunch . Then came a brief fling in the real estate business . In 1931 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cheap ones , but Auntie Maine charmed a friend into buying a big apartment only to discover that the building was empty and that the innocent tenant was carrying its entire maintenance himself . She turned over her commission to help hirer struggle through bankruptcy . Then some trouble with her own mortgage made her wary of all real estate . By the time I was ready to go back to school , Auntie Mame was really cornered by her creditors . She even had to undergo the humiliation of allowing the Trust Company to reimburse her for my living expenses . Her letters to me read like suicide notes . But in early October , I got a letter that was full of the old fight : " Darling boyGuess what ! Auntie Mame 's going back on the stage again ! Vera telephoned and we lunched . So I told her what ghastly luck I 've been having and we got to reminiscing about the old days when we were both in the chorus of Chu Chin Chow . How we laughed over the house detective in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long story short , Vera is opening in a new play and she let me read for a supporting role . I 'm to play Lady Iris , an English aristocrat . We 're like girls again , trouping togetherafter all these years ! But , my little love , this is the best . We open in Boston next month , so that you can sec your Auntie Mame 's big comeback on the very first night . Can you wait ! Off to rehearsal ! " Vera Charles was my Auntie Manse 's best friend , most of the time . She was never a great actress , or even a very good one , but51she was a great star . Vera was what is known as a Woman 's Actress . Matinee audiences adored her . Mr. Woollcott once wrote , " Vera Charles is the world 's only living actress with more changes of costume than of facial expression . " They never spoke after that , but it was true . She was always a Lovely Patrician from an Unidentified Balkan Kingdom , there was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man . It was lousy drama , but great theater , and hausfrausin heaving busloads would return , spent , to Montclair , tears of love and envy still damp on their cheeks . On the great day of Auntie Maine 's opening , the headmaster let me out of hockey practice and I rushed into Boston , where Auntie Mame was quartered at the Ritz . She was in the bathtub when the bellboy let me into her suite , and I could hear her singing , " I am Chu Chin Chow from Chi-na , Shanghai , China . " She emerged from the bath , rosy and warm . " Darling ! I 'm so glad you 've come . Careful , you 'll muss my hair . Now , my little love , Auntie Manic wants you to run out and get her some menthol cough drops . I 'm just going to lie down in a darkened room with a brisk astringent on my face  --  a bit of tightening , you know  --  relax my throat , and run over my lines . Then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toast right here before I go to the theater . La , the excitement of being on the Boards again ! Vera 's given me a lovely bit of business with her in the last act . Oh , and do n't let me forget my jewel box . I looked so underdone in my ball gown at dress rehearsal . " We dined at six . and then Auntie Mame telephoned her friend Vera , to wish her luck . We got to the Colonial Theater at seven and I sat alone in the first row waiting until the house filled up with eager Boston matrons , their unwilling husbands , and a lot of irreverent-looking Harvard boys . Finally the curtain went up . It was Vera 's same old show . Twelve minutes after the first act had begun , Vera entered dead center in a beautiful beige suit with fisher furs and pausedgraciously for the wild ovation . The first act ran to formula , but Auntie Mame never appeared . In Act Two Vera was superb in almond green velvet , and the ladies moaned orgasniically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no sign of Auntie Mame . When the curtain rose on the third act , Vera and the Other Matt were alone on the stage . The applause for her evening dress was tremendous . A gala party was supposedly in progress offstage. ' l'ltere was lilting waltz music and a babble of gay conversation , and I suddenly heard a familiar voice call , " O0000h , some more champagne , Lord 1 ) tulley ! There also seemed to be a distant and faint tinkle of bells . Vera looked a little uneasy , but went on with her speech . " But , Rrrreginald , " Vera said in her incomprehensible Mayfair accent , " tew dew sech a thing  --  tew desk oaf tewgethaw lake thissswouldbe med ; quate , quate enchentingly med . " " O0000h , Lord Dudley , " I heard Auntie Mame 's unmistakablevoice cry from the wings , " I could dahnce the night away ! " Again the mysterious tinkling of bells . It struck a jarring note among the offstage noises of titled people at play . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigid coiffeur , and began again . " Naow , Rrrreginald , it would be medness . Ay belung tew one wuld , yew tew anothah . We maight faind heppiness faw one brief niaownicnt , but we 'd hate awselves  --  yais , and each othah , tew  --  faw what we 'd done .

Huddy , Rrrreginald , Ay huh tiie othahs coining . " The music struck up again and a lot of festive couples spun in through the archway . ' 1'lic ringing of bells grew much , much louder , and a flash of red whirled onto the stage . " O000h , Lord Dudley , " Auntie Manic called , " you waltz divinely ! " Vera staggered . The bells rang even more insistently . In a voicethat one associates with hog-calling , Vera shouted , " Aaow , come in avery-one ! Ay 've sumthing tew tale yew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in artistic groupingsfacing Vera . By now there was a positive clangor of chimes . The balcony tittered . I stared at Auntie Mame . She looked lovely in a pretty , flame-colored dress , but around her wrists she 'd festooned a bunch of bracelets fashioned from large silver Siamesetemple bells  --  the gift of some forgotten admirer . Now there was a ripple of mirth in the orchestra and Vera was so startled that she blew up the next line . It did n't matter , anyhow , because the bell-ringing and the laughter would have drowned out a forghorn . Vera stepped forward to the footlights and delivered her line again , square into the rafters : " Ay rayed Ay 'm nut gaowing to meddy Rrreginald eftcr ull . May place is at haome with Prince Alexisss . Ay must gaow beck  --  beck to may wuld . " Then she turned toward Auntie Manic and shot her a look that would have paralyzed the average Bengal tiger . " Lady Irrriss , " Vera said to Auntie Manic , " would yew be gude enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Auntie Maine said with a deep curtsy . Her Siamese bell bracelets pealed deafeningly . Vera 's speech about ringing had been an unfortunate one , but the balcony loved it . There were roars of laughter and a great deal of stamping . Then the bells started again and Auntie Mame , much flustered , advanced toward Vera bearing a mountainous chinchilla cape . Auntie Mame 's bell bracelets were somewhat  --  but not fully  --  muffled in the folds of fur for a moment . " Do let me help you , Princess , " Auntie Mame said in her resounding voice . She held out the cape which unfolded like a Venetian blind , thus releasing the bells to their full volume . I stared with horror when I saw that Auntie Mame was holding Vera 's cape upside down . " Thenk yew , Lady Iris , " Vera roared , sweeping the cape around her . An awful look came across her face , though , as she gathered54the hem of her cloak around her shoulders and saw that its collar was trailing behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of hysterical giggle myself until I noticed that Auntie Manic seemed to be attached to Vera 's upside-down chinchilla wrap . Vera roved forward to deliver her last line and Auntie Manic followed , her outstretched arm mysteriously connected to the small of Vera 's back . Then I understood . One of her Siamese bell bracelets had got caught iii the fur . Vera moved forward again . Auntie Manie followed , accompanied by the chorus of bells . Finally Vera stood stock still . " I , et go ! " she grunted . " Vera , " Auntie Mame squeaked , " I ca n't ! " The house rocked with unsuppresscd hilarity , whistles , and stamping . Vera bellowed her last line with Auntie Mame still trying to wrench herself free and the curtain fell , enveloping them both  --  kicking and clawing  --  in its yards of dusty velour . I 'll never forget that night as long as I live . Vera , in the harsh accents of her native Pittsburgh , called Auntie Mame every vile name I 'd ever heard , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She laid her head on the cluttered dressing table , and shook with sobs . " But , Ve-e-ra , " she moaned , " these are the only bracelets I have left . " Vera screamed at her like a fishwife . " You dirty , cheap society bitch ' Try to louse up my opening , will ya ! I hate you ! You and all your no-good kind . " Vera continued to yell and scrc ; nu until the manager removed her forcibly from the room and slammed Auntie Maine 's notice on the dressing table . Auntie Marie wept long after the theater was dark . She kept repeating and repeating , " But they 're the only bracelets I have left . The only bracelets I have . " It was nearly two o'clock when I lung her old mink coat around her and half carried her out to a taxi and into the Ritz . Weeping uncontrollably , she let me help her to bed . I never knew that a human body could contain so many tears , and when I held her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I got scared and called the hotel physician . The next day I took Auntie Mame all the way back to New55York in an ambulance . She was still sobbing and burning with fever . She squeezed my hand until I thought all my bones were broken and she moaned over and over , " But Vera , they 're the only bracelets I have left . Everything else is gone . The only bracelets I have , Vera . The only ones . " Back in New York Norah put her to bed , unconscious and runninga terrible temperature . Norah and Ito , like many domestic servants during the depression , were working only for room and board . But they worshipped Auntie Mame . Norah even paid for the ambulance and my ticket back to school . I stood miserably in Auntie Mame 's bedroom twisting my St. Boniface cap in my hands . When I left , she was still delirious and still moaning about the bracelets . Norah sat beside her , stroking her feverish hand . " Now , you hush , dearie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a nice man . You hush up , lovcy , and get rested so you can find a good , steady man . " I was so worried about Auntie Maine that I could hardly study . But at Thanksgiving she sent a short formal note which said , " I have accepted a position with the R. 1 I. Macy Company . I am to sell roller skates at least until Christmas and there are excellent opportunities for advancement . The personnel director tells me that Macy 's is very anxious to obtain college-trained people of the better type . " From then on her letters grew gayer . She told touching and amusing stories about life in the toy department during the Christmas rush ; about a decayed Austrian baroness who sold mania dolls , and a former M. I. T. professor who was demonstratingGilbert chemistry sets . Auntie Mame confessed girlishly that the training program had been a little confusing and that keeping track of a sales book nearly drove her mad . " But , " she wrote , " I 've evolved the perfect system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's the easiest way for me and it 's also easy for the customers , since it saves them from having to spend a lot of hard-come-by money right then and there . They buy now andpay later  --  really very economical . " She said that her feet hurt and she hated wearing black all the time , but that it was fun and she could n't wait to see me at Christmas vacation . I was kind of lonely with Auntie Marne away all day , and she looked pale and tired when she came home every night . But she was very gay about the store and all of her C.O.D.s . Auntie Manic still had a lot of unpaid bills , and I overheard her talking on the telephone the Sunday before Christmas . She was crying and she said , " . . . but of course I ca n't raise that kind of money before January . We 'll simply lose the house , that 's all . " Later I heard Norali tell her that Shaffer 's insisted on pay- ment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sue . Auntie Mame cried some more and said , " Eighteen dollars a week and that miserable monthly pittance  --  why , I ca n't even buy Patrick a Christmas present . " I did n't care . I 'd saved all of my allowance and sold my micro- scope to buy Auntie Mame 's present . Remembering her unfor- tunate bells , I 'd bought her the biggest rhinestone bracelet twelve dollars would buy . I figured that with a real mink coat  --  even if it was a little sprung in the seat  --  the bracelet would look genuine and Auntie Marne would be happy again . But the awful blow fell on the day before Christmas . I was wrapping Auntie Mame 's present when I heard the front door close . ' I'licn I heard Auntie Maine 's high-heeled slippers trudging into the living room . But there was no effusive yoo-hoo . I tiptoed down to the living room and there was Auntie Mame sitting on a low hassock , her mink coat around her shoulders . 1lcr face was cupped in her hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " why are you home so early ? " " Oh , Pat rick , " she wept , " I 've , I 've been f-fired . Thrown out of Macy ' s ! " She sat there in the living room rocking back and forth and crying helplessly while I stood iii misery next to her . " Patrick , Patrick , " she gasped . " It was n't my fault . He , he would n't take the skates C.O.D . " 57 " Who would n't ? " I asked . " The Southern man , " she choked . " He seemed so nice and gentle and pleasant and good-looking . And he ordered twenty p-pairs of skates . And then , " she broke down again , " and then I tried to send them to him C.O.D . and he would n't let me . He wanted to pay for them and t-take them with him . And  --  and I told him I only knew how to do C.O.D.s . And then he . . . Oh , Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and a Cavanaugh hat  --  and he was staying at the St. Regis and surely they could have paid the C.O.D .  --  it was only fifty-one dollars ... " " But , Auntie Mame , what happened , what did he do ?

" She broke down and wept miserably . " Go on , Auntie Mame . What did the Southern man do ? " " He  --  he was n't there , the section manager took me away so fast . And I had the best sales record in r-roller skates . " " But what did they do , Auntie Mame ?

But still Auntie Manse sat there inn dumb misery , sobbing softly and rocking to and fro . At six o'clock Ito came in to light the lamps and at one minute after six Norah bustled in and tried her best to comfort Auntie Maine , but she would n't move , would n't speak . She just sat there and sobbed . I did n't think Auntie Manic should be left alone for fear she might I ) o Something , so I went over and sat glumly in a corner . ' I'lie mink coat had slipped off Auntie Mame 's shoulders and she sat there in her plain black little shopgirl 's dress , her face very white and tears rolling down her cheeks . Then the doorbell rang . In a moment Ito came in , very correct in his white jacket . " Mister Burnside , come see Madame . " " T-tell him I 'm not at home , " Auntie Mame said flatly . " I tell him you no receiving , Madame , but he say e-ssential . He come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " she said urgently , " then I must sec him . Perhaps they want me back . " Ito ushered in a big stranger  --  very tall , very handsome . He was wearing a camel 's hair coat and a brown hat . Auntie Manic stared at him blankly  --  stunned . " It 's you ! Are n't you satisfied with having cost me my job ? Have you come to persecuteme more ? Perhaps drive me out of my home ? " " Please , ma'am , " the stranger said , " I 've been all over that old store tryin ' to find out who you were and where I could get in touch with vou . When that floorwalker fcllah came back , I asked bins when . you ' ( 1 gone and he said you 'd been fired . I said that was all wrong .

" Miss Dennis , I been all over this town in a taxicab . But now that I found you , Miss Dennis , do you mind if I pay off the driver and let him go home to his family ?

" But I noticed that she hurriedly powdered her nose and ran a comb through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coat . " Ma'am , " he said , kneeling by Auntie Mame , " I do n't want you to be mad with me because of that job .

But , Miss Dennis , " he said , looking appreciatively around the room , " I did n't know you had money . A lady with a nice little place like this do n't have to work at Macy 's . " Then Auntie Mame threw back her head and started to laugh . She laughed and laughed and the tears rolled down her cheeks again . Mr. Burnside turned an angry ( lark red and his eyes blazed . " Miss Dennis , if you were just playin ' some kind of joke , I do n't think it 's very funny . I spent the whole , livelong aftahnoon huntin ' you up in alphabetical order , and I ...

" You come on out here , darlin ' , " she whispered , " Miss Mame 's entertaining a gentleman . A Southern gentleman ! " I was upstairs reading Bring ' Em Back Alive when Auntie Mame came up , her eyes dancing . " Oh , darling , we 're saved , " she60whispered . " He 's going to give me a job with the Dixie Belle Enterprises  --  that 's a big oil company . I 'm to be a receptionist and it pays thirty dollars a week ! Ile 's very polite .

" With the real mink coat and the real smile of happiness , it looked like the realest diamond braceletin the world . The next day was Christmas and Auntie Mame looked radiant  --  if a little hung over  --  as she gave me a big box from Brooks Brothers . It contained my first suit with long trousers . " Merry , merry Christmas , my little love , " she cried . " Gee , Auntie Mame , thanks ! " I said . Later that day I noticed that a Tiepolo drawing of some naked religious people was missingfrom her bedroom . It was Auntie Mame 's favorite picture , but she seemed very happy .

Auntie Maine was out most of the rest of that week . Mr. Burnsidetook her to lunch and tea and dinner and the theater every day .

" 4 63AUNTIE MAME0 and the Southern BelleRounding out its Unforgettable Character even more , this article goes on to say how the little spinster had a real athletic prowess . Or at least she developed one in a hurry . It seems that she got kind of worried with her foundling being bright iii school and a comfort to her and her cat but still having no father to instruct him in the manly arts . She thought he might end up as a bookish weakling if she did n't take action . So she sent off to Spalding 's for a whole lot of sporting equipment and set out to teach hint all lied ever need to know . It worked fine and iu the process of coaching the kid , the old girl became quite the athlete herself  --  so good , in fact , that she copped half the prizes at the Danbury Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I wo n't come right out and say that Auntie Mame ever did anything like that , but she did establish a certain reputationfor herself in the field . In fact , she is still spoken of with awed reverence in certain parts of the country for her feats as a sportswomanafter she married Mr. Burnside . A few uncharitable people have said that Auntie Mame married Mr. Burnside for his money . I will concede that Mr. Burnside 's being the richest man under forty south of Washington , D. C. may have influenced her . But she really loved him . He was father , brother , son , Santa Claus , and lover . Her new husband , Beau , was one of those big , genial , easygoing , lovable Southerners . He sprang from a fine , impoverished old Georgia family , but he was unique among generals ' descendantsin that he did n't mope around Dixie talking about the carefreedays before those damnyankees ravished its land and its women . Instead , Beau had gone out and raised soybeans and peanuts while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton crops . By the time he was nineteen , the Burnside land was free from debt and erosion and was showing a profit . During his last year at Georgia " Tech he went off to Texas to settle an estate of barren wasteland left by some migratory cousin , discovered oil on the property , and was a millionaire before he was twenty-one . Everything Uncle Beau touched seemed to turn to gold , and he was constantly amazed and delighted by his good fortune . " Just luck , sugar , " he 'd say to Auntie Marne . Money meant very little to him except for the pleasure it could give to others . He was high on the list of every charity in the country , he was the sole support of an ancient mother and a pack of indolent kinfolk , and he was an easy touch for anybody with a fairly plausible hard-luck story . Uncle Beau paid up all of Auntie Mame 's debts , sold her carriagehouse  --  he said that nice women did n't live on Murray Hill  --  returned Norah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meath with a handsome pension . He moved Auntie Mame into about ten rooms in the St. Regis Hotel and encouraged her to go right back to her old scale of spending . She was happy to oblige . Although she was pretty much her old self , I noticed certain64subtle changes . It was fashionable to be romantic in 1932 , but Auntie Mame went a step farther . I-Ier hair was fluffier , softer ; there were always a lot of camellias around the rooms ; her dresses seemed to run to organdy and ruffles , and there was almost a roar of crinoline beneath her skirts . When Uncle Beau insisted that she have her portrait painted , Auntie Mame commissioned a society portraitist rather than one of the stark moderns who frequentedher drawing room . The finished picture gave the impression of having been executed not with a brush , but with a pastry tube , and Auntie Mame kept saying it was a pity that Winterhalterwas n't still alive . IIer speech grew slightly blurred , softer and less staccato . She called me Honey a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my thirteenth birthday she sent a whole bale of gifts , but prominent among them were a beautiful and intricate set of antique Confederate soldiers , which I still have , a three-volume set of books on General Lee , and , of all things , a yellowed first edition of The Little Colonel . I knew what was coming . That June I graduated from the Lower School to the Upper School . I could have managed to do it myself , but Auntie Mame wrote an exuberant letter to announce that she and Uncle Beau were motoring up to St. Boniface to take part in the great celebration . " ' Men , honey , " she wrote , " I 've got a big surprise . You and your Uncle Bcauregard and I are all going to drive down to Georgia to spend the summer on our big old plantation and see my sweet little old mother-in-law . Excuse the haste of this letter , but the Daughters of the Confederacy are meeting here today . Ca n't wait to see you-all ! " She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fluttering white garden party dress  --  it looked as though it were made of spun sugar  --  lace gloves , lace hat , lace parasol which she twirled coquettishly , and a lace fichu which she kept dropping to be retrieved by the pimpled gallants of St. Boniface . I won the composition prize for the Lower School65and she said to the English master , " Ah vow , Ah 'm so proud of that child Ah could jes bust ! But then , his daddeh was one of the most literareh boys down home . " We drove down to Georgia in Uncle Beau 's big Dusenberg phaeton , stopping here to see this grand ole monument or that noble ole battlefield where our Southun boys fought and died valiantly defendin ' theah beliefs . Most of the countryside looked pretty bleak to me , but Auntie Mame , who 'd been through it before on the Palm Beach sleeper , spoke at some length of its gracious ole heritage and its rich memories . When the car swept up to the pillared portico of Peckerwood , the Burnside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bags and a mountainous colored woman who looked like the ads for pancake flour heaved and shook and said Lan'sakes about thirty times . Auntie Mame was in her clement . Beau 's Texas oil money , his Cuban sugar money , his New York stock market money , his Canadian mining money had all helped to restore the gracious rooms of Peckerwood to their ante-bellum magnificence . There were damask draperies , rosewood chairs , Sheraton tables , and crystal chandeliers with hurricane chimneys . Auntie Mame said it was just dawlin ' . I was shown to my room , a big chamber with a canopied bed , a Chippendale chest-on-chest , and French windows giving on the second floor piazza . There was a Yankee bathroom next to it with real post-bellum Crane plumbing . Auntie Mame seemed a little miffed that she was n't going to be quartered in the main house , too , but tradition had it that the son and his wife always lived in the Bride 's Cottage beyond the boxwood maze in the garden . Later I think she was thankful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept saying as she unpacked her dimities , " when am Ah gon na meet yo sweet little ole mothah ? " Mrs. Burnside could by no stretch of the imagination be called either sweet or little . But she was old , and I suppose that God in His infinite wisdom had seen fit to make her mother , although I 've often risked blasphemy to wonder why . She was built along66the lines of a General Electric refrigerator and looked like a cross between Caligula and a cockatoo . Mother Burnside had beady little eyes , an imperious beak of a nose , sallow skin , and bad breath . She wore a stiff black wig and a stiff black dress and she sat all day long in a darkened drawing room , her pudgy hands  --  encrusted with dirty diamond rings  --  folded over her pudgy belly . She was a grim , taciturn woman , but when she put her mind to it , she could converse on several subjects : a ) her exalted ancestors , b ) how uppity the nigralis were gettin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mrs. Burnside was , and c ) the lamentable condition of her bowels . But usually she just sat in thin-lipped disapproval , her evil black eyes darting like a malign old parrot 's . There was one other occupant in the manor house at Peckerwood . That was Cousin Fan , the poorest relation . She was a faded , vague , timid spinster , whose penance for her poverty was to be at the constant beck and call of Mother Burnside . Miss Fan was rather sweet and pathetic in a masochistic fashion . She had an I. Q. of about thirty-five and all of her time that was n't passed catering to the stolid whims of Mrs. Burnside was spent in doing Good Works for the Negroes and praying to a genteel and stone-deaf Episcopal God . Miss Fan scratched at the door of my bedroom after I 'd gone to the bathroom and unpacked my clothes . " Hello , " she whispered , " I 'm Miss Fanny Burnside , Beau 's cousin . I 'm sorry I was n't at the door to greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving Cousin Euphcncia  --  Miz Burnside , I mean  --  her purge . You 're Miz Bean 's nephew , are n't you ? " I said I was and how did she do . " Maybe you 'd rare to come down to the verandah and sit a spell . Miz Burnside clout finish her nap ' til four . " Miss Fan and I sat and rocked and eventually Auntie Mame and Uncle Beau strolled over from the Bride 's Cottage . Auntie Manic was fearfully animated , kissed Miss Fan several times , and called her Cousin Fanny . The old colored man brought out a big decanter of bourbon and some Coca-Cola and Auntie Mame grew67awfully cozy and familiar there on the verandah . " Ah swcah , Cousin Fanny , " she shrilled , " yoah jes about as cute as a bug ! " Miss Fan tittered nervously . It was easy to see that Uncle Beau was terribly proud of Auntie Mame . She called him her big , ole lamb-cat and kept twining his reddish-gold hair into little ringlets . Miss Fan giggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beau had found such a nice little wife . About that time there was fearful thumping from somewhere inside the house and Miss Fan 's plain face went gray . " Mercy , " she said , " I hope all our talking has n't disturbed Cousin Euphemia . She almost never wakes up so early . " Again the thumping , and Miss Fan flew into the house . Auntie Mame 's meeting with her mother-in-law was epic . Miss Fan came scuttling out to the verandah as Uncle Beau was pouringanother round of bourbon . " She 's ready to sec you-all . " " Oh , is n't that dandch , Beau , honey ! " Auntie Maine gushed . " Ah jes cai n't wait ! " I could have waited an eternity . Miss Fan timorously led the way into the back drawing room , and there sat Mother Burnside . " Mothah , honeh ' " Auntie Maine squealed , and rushed up to kiss her . If Mother Burnside 's pungent breath was n't enough to stop further intimacies , her opening remark was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . Auntie Mame reeled . She never revealed her exact age and on a legal document she 'd say " Over twenty-one , " which no one ever seemed inclined to question . I suspected she was between thirtyfiveand forty , and she seemed a lot younger . Mrs. Burnside favored Uncle Beau with her baleful black stare . " Yes , Beauregand , you gave me to unduhstand that yoah wife was much youngah . You look tired son ; mighty tired . " Beau kissed her forehead reverently and then introduced me . I took her puffed old hand and bowed in my best dancing school manner . " You seem nice enough , " she said , " for a Yankee boy . " 6968Auntie Mame had by now recovered from the initial barrage and gamely tried once more . " What a lovely , lovely old Greek Revival house this is , Mother  --  nh , Mrs. Burnside . " I noticed that all trace of her Southern accent had disappeared . " We like it , " Mrs. Burnside said tersely , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her bowels . Dinner that night was a funereal affair . There was a thick soup , a great roast of pork , roasted potatoes , candied yams , hominy grits , corn bread , and a pineapple upside-down cake . I had terrible nightmares , and even Auntie Maine admitted to a slight twinge of acid indigestion . The conversation was spotty . Auntie Maine held forth valiantly on the charm of Greek Revival houses and the influence of Virtruvius brought down through Palladio , Castle , Jones , Adam , and finally Thomas Jefferson . Beau said about six times how good it was to be home , but without much conviction . Miss Fan twittered a great deal until Mrs. Burnside jabbed her viciously with a fork and said to be still . That , plus a few portentousbelches , was her only contribution to the merrymaking . Directly after dinner she went to bed and Miss Fan scurried along to help her undress and to read a chapter of the Bible aloud to her . Auntie Maine 's visit had n't started out well . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family reunion . Left to her own devices , Mrs. Burnside would n't have given so much as a wake for her new daughter-in-law , but since it was owing only to Beau that she and the rest of her patrician relations were n't residing at the County I Ionic , she gave in reluctantly when he wanted to spend sonic of his own money in his own home for his own wife , and the gathering of the clan was scheduled . The bride was presented officially to her new relatives when they appeared en masse at a giant barbecue the following Sunday . At noon we were all on the verandah . Auntie Mame was looking lovely and fragile in yellow dotted swiss with a big leghorn hat , and Uncle Beau stood next to her in his ice cream suit , proud as a peacock . Mrs. Burnside was dressed for the next ice age . Shesat in a rocker wearing a voluminous black silk dress , black boots , a black shawl , black glasses , a black sunshade , black gloves , and a black hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Fan in for her potion . Then the relatives started coming . Car after car streaked into the drive and parked on the spacious lawn . " Ruin the grass , " Mrs. Burnside growled , and her stomach rumbled alarmingly . I 've never seen so many Southerners before or since . It seemed impossible that they were all part of the same family  --  or even the same county  --  but they were . Beau 's sisters , Willie Mae , Sally Randolph , and Georgia Lee arrived first with their husbands . The sisters had each managed to have six children under the age of five and there was a lot of introducing and kissing and you-ailing . Although they were n't very attractive people , Auntie Mame began to exude charm , but Mrs. Burnside did n't . IIcr digestive tract voiced an eloquent protest with each new face . The relatives kept coming . They all had two first names and some of them even had two last names . There were about six men named Moultrie , four named Calhoun , eight called Randolph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his or her name . To make things even more confusing , about half the women had men 's names . There were ladies called Sarah John , Liza William , Susie Carter , Lizzie Beaufort  --  pronounced Byew-fert  --  Mary Arnold , Annie Bryan , Lois Dwight . By one o'clock there were more than a hundred and twenty relatives milling around Peckerwood , all talking , and all talking loud . Mrs. Burnside indicated her disapproval of all this with a fanfaronade of flatulence . Still the relatives came . Beau was the kind of man who 'd be popular anywhere , and since almost all of the guests were directly or indirectly supported by him , it was safe to predict a full turnout . Auntie Mame was in her element , and above Mrs. Burnside 's steady barrage of gas attacks I could hear her talking vivaciously . At quarter-past one the Clay-Picketts , or horsy branch of the family , started piling in . They were all in riding clothes , and they70were accompanied by a spotted hound who immediately jumped into Mrs. Burnside 's lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure she 'd been saving for the climax of the party . I sniggeredhelplessly . " Down , sir ! Down , I say , " Van Buren Clay-Pickett roared , and smacked the hound across the hocks , thereby eliciting a soft , moist hiccough front Mrs. Burnside . " Sorry we'ah all so late , Aunt 1 , ; upheniia , but Sally Cato McDougall got unseated goin ' ( wall the five-bah an ' we think she broke her collah bone . Heel , sir ! " he bellowed at the dog , who 'd managed to knock over three children and was now lifting his leg at the base of one of Peckerwood'ssix Ionic columns . " Had to shoot her mare . Cousin Clytie and Alice-Richard thought they bettah take Sally Cato to the doctah 's , but they 'll be along directly . When Sally Cato come to she said to tell you she was awful sorry she could n't make the shin-dig . Down , sir , goddamn it  --  pardon me , Aunt Euphemiadown , I say . " The dog had leaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligently into the folds of her black silk skirt . Again the big horseman 's hand smacked the hound and a piteous eructation of outraged virtue was clearly heard from Mrs. Burnside . I had to go indoors for a minute to regain control of myself . " Down , sir . Heel , Ah tell ya ! " When I rune back outdoors the rest of the Clay-Picketts had arrived  --  nine of them , all in riding clothes ; athletic to the end . The bourbon and branch water was flowing faster and faster and Auntie Maine had gathered a rapt circle of admiring new relatives around her . Mrs. Burnside shook her head dyspepticallyand popped another soda mint into her mouth . All at once the air was split by the blare of a horn and a dark green Packard roadster slithered up the drive . The top was down and a colored boy in dark green stable livery was driving . Sitting on the folded back roof was the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen in my life . She was wearing riding clothes dnd her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk scarf . " Hello , everybody , hello , you-all , " she called in a throaty71voice . " Sorry I 'm late , but my horse had a run-in with a five-bar gate . " There was a silence and then a lot of whispering among the relatives . " Land a goshen , " an old uncle with an ear trumpet cackled , " ai n't that Sally Cato McDougall , the gal used to be engaged to young Beau ? " " You hush , Uncle Moultrie , " Willie Mae screamed . " Yes , it sure enough is , but what Ah 'd like to know is who in the wuld evah invited her . " She was n't long in finding out . Broken wing and all , the beautiful lady jumped gracefully down from the car and ran up to Mrs. Burnside . " Mrs. Burnside , " she said in her lovely voice , " I 'm so sorry to be late when you went to all that trouble to invite me especially . Doctor wanted me to go straight to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party for a million dollars . " The old lady burst into a big smile . " Welcome to Peckahwood , Sally Cato , it jus would n't be a pahty without you . " Uncle Beau looked kind of mystified . " Beau Burnside , congratulations ! " the beautiful lady said . " Now , let me see this New York bride you 've gone out and got yourself . " She gave Auntie Mame a lovely smile and stretched out her elegant right hand . " How do you do , Mrs. Beau . I 'm Sally Cato McDougall . You got yourself a mighty wild stallion , but I reckon any woman as good looking as you can train him just fine . " Auntie Mame 's face glowed with delight . " Why , Beau , why did n't you tell me about Miss McDougall ? She 's perfectly gorgeous ! " They smiled beatifically , and then the rest of the party began gabbling with the noisy release and relief that comes over a crowd when a serious accident has been narrowly averted . Lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnside , and then the barbecue began in earnest . Auntie Mame had scored a social victory among the relatives . They all thought she was the most chowmin ' Yankee lady they 'd ever met and were so ardent in their praise that Mrs. Burnside72was confined to her bed for the next three days . Auntie Mame was pleased to be such a success and was kept pretty busy acceptingall the invitations she 'd received from various cousins . But of all the people in Richmond County , she found Sally Cato McDougall the most attractive . And , of course , she was . The fact that Sally Cato had been Uncle Beau 's former fiancee and was left holding the bag and a five-carat square-cut diamond when Manic and Beau eloped did n't bother her very much . Auntie Manic had been engaged a lot of tunes herself , and she understood that such things Just Happened . She 'd never even known of Sally Cato 's existence until the day of the big barbecue , so she hardly felt that she 'd connived to steal the prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and in a week 's time the pair of them were inseparable . Sally Cato had gone North to school and learned how to speak English , she 'd been to Europe a couple of times , and she was really the most cultivated girl of twenty-five Auntie Mame had ever met . She also had a **26;9294;TOOLONG , honest quality that captivated everybody . She was expert at everything she did , swimming , dancing , driving , golf , tennis , and bridge  --  but riding and hunting were her greatest loves . The morning after the barbecue , the green Packard roadster screeched to a stop in front of the Bride 's Cottage and Sally Cato , looking crisp and lovely , skipped up to the terrace where Auntie Maine and I were having our Little Morning Chat . " Good morning , you-all , " she called . " Sorry to barge in this way , but with this old sprained arm , I ca n't ride , ca n't swim , ca n't do anything but sit and mope . I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also a little bored at Peckerwood when Uncle Beau was n't around , greeted her warmly . The two ladies had quite a friendly chat and it soon appeared that they had a lot more in common than Uncle Beau . " Well , honey , the best woman won , " Sally Cato said generously . Then she said , " Look , you and this youngster here must find it pretty tiresome73with Beau out all day long , and I 'm so lonesome at home I 'd like to die . So why do n't you-all come over to Foxglove for lunch . I have a younger brother just about your age , Patrick . He 's a mean little devil , but at least he 'll be something gayer for you than Mrs. Burnside and silly old Fanny . " Auntie Maine jumped at the opportunity for a little intellectual companionship , and twenty minutes later the two women were intimately swigging bourbon on the verandah at Foxglove . The McDougall plantation was every bit as grand as Peckerwoodand the food was a lot more digestible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen came slinking around the boxwood hedge and eyed me coldly . " Oh ! " Sally Cato jumped , " it 's you . I wish you 'd stop sneakingaround . It always gives me such a start . Patrick , this is my brother , Emory Oglethorpe . I hope you two can keep each other out of mischief this summer . " If you did n't know that the blood in his veins ran as blue as the Confederate flag , you 'd have sworn that Emory Oglethorpe McDougall was the changeling child of some ill-starred Georgia cracker girl . He was small and wiry , with an incredible head of russet-colored hair and the biggest , greenest eyes I 've ever seen . Although he was only six months my elder , Emory Oglethorpe was a century ahead of me when it came to a firsthand knowledge of evil . Sally Cato refused to let Emory Oglethorpe have any brandy after lunch and told us to run along and play . " I think your sister is very nice , " I told him in a conversational way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . She 's an A numbah one bitch ! " Then he said , " Wanta come down to mah shack ? If ya pay me a little somethin ' maybe Ah 'll show ya mah pictchas . " Emory Oglethorpe had constructed a one-room snuggery concealed by vines along the banks of the Savannah River . The place contained some tallow candles , a couple of orange-crate chairs , and a sagging army cot  --  Confederate Army , I believe  --  on which he had allegedly seduced quite a number of young colored girls . " Get you a nice , tawny pickaninny girl , " he croaked malevolently , " if ya give me fifty cents . Best kinda poontang there is . All like a good piece of dank meat . " Upon payment of a dime he showed me an exhaustive coIlectiouof pornographic photographs , vintage of about 19oo. ' flue ladies and gentlemen in the pictures looked kind of oldfashioned , but they were indulging irr very modern things . Since biology limits sex  --  and its variations  --  to about a dozen pastimes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came upon one of Uncle Beau and Sally Cato McDougall in a most intimate position . I jumped in astonishment . " Fooled ya , did n't Ah ? " Emory Oglethorpe croaked wickedly . " Ah jest pasted pictchas of theah heads onto that photo . But Ah bet they did it , jest the same . Gawdlmighty , you shoulda seen ole Sally Cato when she hud that Beau 'd got married up No'th . She like to busted . Went goddin ' and damnin ' all ovah the house and swo ' she 'd have the hide of the duhty damnyankeewho got Beau . Ah nevah see such cay'ins-on in all mah bone days . Ah was glad . Ah hate huh ! Heah , have a cig-arette . " I was horrified , but it was a bit of gratuitous information I was interested to get and I tucked it away among an odd collection of I , it t lc-Known Facts About Well-Known People . When Emory Oglethorpe and I went back to the house , Auntie Nl ; uuc , under the influence of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally Cato . " . . . Oh , but my dear , " she was saying , " I simply adore riding . I was practically born on horseback . Why , back in New York h:udly a day goes by that I do n't get a little workout . Up with the birds every morning for a brisk canter through Central 1 ' : a-k ! " My mouth dropped open . I suppose that Auntie Manic had taken a few riding lessons at some dim finishing school in her Northern past , but she 'd never so much as looked at a horse in all the years I 'd known her . " Why , that 's splendid , Mame , " Sally Cato said . " Most interesting . I 'll have to get hold of your cousin , Van Buren ClayPickett  --  he'sMaster of the Hounds down here  --  and organize a big hunt in your honor . " " Oh , what a pity , " Auntie Mame said quickly . " I 've left all my riding togs up North . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozens of things you could wear . What size shoe do you take ? " " Uh , five-B , " Auntie Mame said , tucking her feet under her . " Marvelous , " Sally Cato said . " Same as I do . I can even fit you out with boots . " Auntie Mame went pale beneath her tan . " You do ride astride , Mame dear ? " A hopeful gleam came into Auntie Mame 's eyes . " Oh , never ! Sidesaddle  --  always . Daddy , the colonel , insisted that I learn it . He said it was the only way for a lady to ride  --  so graceful . It was silly of him , of course , because now nobody rides sidesaddle , but it 's the only way I know how . " She finished with a sigh of relief , but her joy was short-lived . " Now , is n't that grand ! " Sally Cato said . " I just happen to have an old Champion and Wilton saddle that 'll do you fine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to ride sidesaddle myself , but now I always sit astride ; it 's a deal safer . Now , I 'm going right in and call Van Buren Clay-Pickett over at the Stud . We never hunt in this hot weather , but I 'm sure we 'll all be happy to make an exception for you . " Having made her bed , Auntie Mame was eventually forced to lie in it . News of her equestrian prowess spread far and fast over the countryside , and at almost every family get-together the conversation was switched to quarters and withers , heaves and spavins as a concession to Auntie Mame . The whole county buzzed with talk of Auntie Mame 's forthcomingdebut on the field and Uncle Beau went around with his chest puffed up like a pouter pigeon 's . Van Buren ClayPickettquickly rounded up a flea-bitten old fox and the big76 77hunt was scheduled for the next Sunday . I did n't know what Auntie Mame was going to do , but I had n't reckoned with her inventive powers . Two days before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an unbecoming shade of green , and whispered modestly to Sally Cato McDougall of a delicate and mythical female complaint . ' 1'lic hunt was postponed for a week . Given a reprieve , Auntie Maine tried desperately for a new and interesting malady , but she remained in the most robust health . Fortunately she sustained a very genuine accident under the gaze of the whole family and Sally Cato on the Friday precedingthe fateful hunt . Auntie Marne slipped on the highly waxed parquetry in the dining room at Peckerwood and sprained her ankle . Uncle Beau and Sally Cato rushed her to the local doctor , who taped her up and told her to keep off it for a day or two . " Then that means I wo n't be able to ride Sunday ? " she asked . " Absolutely out of the question , Mrs. Beau , " the doctor said . " But of co'se you could follow the hunt in a cab . " Auntie Mame sighed blissfully and closed her eyes . The next clay Sally Cato joined Auntie Mame and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sally Cato was very solicitousof Auntie Mamc 's sprained ankle . Having caught Auntie Manic practicing an intricate tango step , I knew that she was feeling a lot better , but she put on a very convincing show of gallantry over pain . After dessert , Sally Cato unrolled a large and elaborate hand-drawn map of the surrounding countryside . " Maine , honey , I'au just sick that you ca n't ride Sunday . Everybody'sjust dying to sec you on a horse , dear , me especially . " I did n't like her tone . " But , anyhow , Maine , I knew you 'd want to follow the hunt , and Doc says it 's all right for you to drive , so I stayed up ' til all hours working on this map . Now , here 's where the chase starts , and then the fox usually runs down this way . . . " Sally Cato had done a masterful and detailed scaledrawing of the Richmond County hunting territory , and she explained everything beautifully . Uncle Beau 's eyes were moist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there anything you ca n't do ? That 's one of the finest pieces of cartography I 've ever seen . Of course , " he said to Auntie Mame , " Sally Cato knows the field so well she could ride it blindfold . Sally Cato , you 're a real brick . I never woulda thought that anyone would dream of taking all that trouble just to make a little new bride feel at home down here . " The next morning there was a lot of clomping and yelling and Hi , you-ailing out in the driveway of Peckerwood . Uncle Beau was very handsome in his pink coat astride a big horse , and six different members of the hunt said , " I-Ian 's it feel to git back on a hawse aftah gallyvantin ' aroun ' Non Yoke , Boragod ? " The genial horsemen sounded exactly like a minstrel show , but they all looked fine in their hunting jackets . There was a general murmur of disappointment when Auntie Marne appeared in a natty plaid suit hobbling delicately on an ebony cane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Members of the hunt , I 'm afraid I have a piece of bad news for you-all . Mrs. Beau sprained her ankle here at Peckerwood the other night and Doc wo n't let her ride . But she 's such a devoted rider and such an ardent huntswoman that she 's going to follow the hunt in her car , so she 'll be in on the kill . " There was a ripple of applause . Emory Oglethorpe McDougall , who looked like a crooked jockey in his riding clothes , sidled up to me . " Ah 'd rathah follow a map o ' hades than that one ole Sally Cato drew up . If yo'ah smaht , you 'll tell yoah Auntie Mame to jes git lost . " " You 're crazy , " I said . " Okay , " he said , " drive on , fool , hell 's only half full . " Auntie Mame hopped into Beau 's open Dusenberg with surprisingagility . I went along with her to open and close the thousands of gates that blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryside . Auntie Mame had never fully mastered the automobile , but after startling several horses , we lurched off in a cloud of blue monoxide gas . Rolling out to the field behind the pack , Auntie Mane squeezed ' my knee affectionately and said , " Oh , darling , I 'm so thankful for this sprain . Maybe now they 'll get over this horse craze . It was sweet , though , of Sally Cato to make this wonderful map . I just hope I wo n't lie sick when they kill that poor little fox . " With a great deal of trouble , Auntie Maine got the car headed iu the right direction and the hunt was on . We jogged over red clay roads for nearly an hour , turning into this lane and then that one . Occasionally we 'd lose sight of the pack and then they 'd appear again . I hopped out about a million times to open slack , splintery old gates and then shut them after the car had jogged through . It was a remarkable map , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt . Sally Cato had been almost clairvoyant in her knowledge of where and when the fox would be . The roads were terrible , powdery with red dust and deeply rutted . Auntie Mame drove like a startled hare and my liver got a thorough shaking up . She looked a little scared , but once or twice she shouted , " Yoicks , there they go . " Another time she called , " ' Tallyho ! " Just why , I was n't sure . After an eternity of bouncing and lurching , we came to the worst road of all . It ran in deep clay ruts straight across a slopingmeadow . Neither horse nor hound was in sight . Auntie Mame stopped the car and busied herself with her compact . " Mercy , " she said , " now we 've lost them . " Then there was a thunder of hoofs and yelping of hounds . A small black fox clashed down the hill with the pack in hot pursuit . " Ilcre they collie , Auntie Mame , " I yelled . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipstick . Now the horses appeared over the rise . Frantically Auntie Mame tried to start the car ; it spluttered and gagged , but nothing happened . She tried again . ' I ' 1-e pack was drawing nearer and nearer , the horses pummeling down the hill. 79 " The key , Auntie Mame " I shouted . " Oh , yes , " she said wildly . The fox was desperately close . Auntie Mame switched on the ignition and the car bounded forward just as a small cannon ball of black fur darted into the road . There was a terrible screech of brakes and I was thrown forward against the windshield . Then all hell broke loose . Hounds , horses , and riders descended on us like an avalanche . Nearly three dozen riders were thrown , and two big bay mares rammed into the Dusenberg so hard the front fender and hood had to be replaced . A third mount was half in and half out of the back seat , whinnying horribly . All in all , there were more horses shot that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final casualty list was posted there were six broken ankles , four broken arms , a fractured leg  --  compound  --  three cases of concussion , a dislocated pelvis , and countless bruises and abrasions . The riders who were able to walk and speak raced clown to the car in a fury and Auntie Manic fainted dead away . I was almost hysterical , but still able to hear Emory Oglethorpe McDougallgrowl , " What 'd All tell yule ? " , and to note the bitter smile of triumph on Sally Cato 's face . Auntie Mame had been in for the kill , all right . The fox lay dead under the car . If Auntie Mame had been the subject of a good deal of county conversation before the fateful fox hunt , she was now the absolutemania of the riding set . Emory Oglethorpe made it perfectly clear to me that she was now referred to as " that crazy , damnyankee woman who killed all ouah hawses . " People for miles around talked of nothing else , and every day the telephone buzzed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unable to come to Bride 's Cottage for lunch or that they had to postpone indefinitely the little dinner they 'd planned in Auntie Mame 's honor . Auntie Mame , after two weeks of being the uncontested belle of the county , now seemed about as popular as General Sheridan . Mother Burnside seemed to feel a lot better after the news of her daughter-in-law 's downfall , and managed to come downstairsfor dinner every night . Between soda mints and waves of wind , she favored us all with such reminiscences as , " When Ah was a young brick thcah was nothin ' Ali loved and adohed moah than huntin ' . All was a regulalr Di Dina . " Beau sat tight-lipped and looked grim and embarrassed . And one evening when Mother Burnsidc 's memoirs of field and flatulence were particularlytrying , Miss Fan lent Auntie Manic a handkerchief and whispered , " Do n't you pay any heed to her , Miz Beau , she hated hunting and she rode worse than I did ! " But Miss Fan 's mousy solicitude did little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entire community , and she knew it . The only one who still offered her friendship was Sally Cato McDougall . " But , Mame , honey , " she 'd say , " do n't cry like that . It was n't your fault  --  everybody knows that accidents will happen . If the others are too narrow-minded to forgive and forget , well , to hell with them . I 'm still your friend . You know that . " Auntie Mame was intensily grateful to Sally Cato . They saw each other daily , and Sally Cato was the only person who was nice to her . Even Uncle Beau seemed stiff around Auntie Mame . I saw a lot of Emory Oglethorpe while Auntie Mame was in purdah . Ile taught me how to smoke and chew and drink a vile kind of dandelion wine he concocted . " Didn ' believe me , didja , when Ah tole yuh Sally Cato was out to have yoah Auntie 's hide . I , awd , nian , she knew you-all 'd be drivin ' acrosst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huntin ' country like the hack of huh ha-vand . You shoulda huhd huh laughin ' and screunin ' an ' ca'vin ' on aftah all them hawses spilled to hell an ' gone ovate yoah Auntie 's call . Ah thought it was a pretty funny-lookin ' sight , mahscif . Don ' worry , Sally Cato 's gon na get Beau hack if she has to kill yoah Auntie doin ' it . " He chuckled maliciously . " Ole Sally Cato 's nevah lost a bet , o ' a race , o ' a man ii- huh life , and she sho do n't inten ' to staht now . Heah , take the resta this parka Luckics . " I was beginning to be half convinced that Emory Oglethorpewas right , although it did n't seem possible that Sally Cato would stoop to anything so low . But that evening I began to appreciate Emory Oglethorpe 's appraisal of his sister . Sally Cato , who was the great favorite of Mrs. Burnside 's , dined with us at Peckerwood . She looked very Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was charm itself . Auntie Mame , who had been openly snubbed in the millinery department of J. B. White 's that afternoon , looked tired , and what 's more , she looked old . Mother Burnside was unusually talkative that night , and in her oblique fashion she let poor Auntie Mame have it right between the eyes . She spoke of nothing but Sally Cato . Sally Cato 's beauty , her youth , her wealth , her ancient lineage , her seat on a horse , how lovely she 'd looked at the last I hunt Ball , how vital and healthy she always seemed , how typically , charmingly , radiantly Southern she was . " A real , genii-wine dauglitah of ouah own fay-ate county . A blue-blooded young flowah of the Old South and of ouah glorious community wheal ' every family has a rich background of great traditions and wheah no strangeh has trespassed since the Wall of the See-cession . " Auntie Mame claimed a sick headache and left right after dinner . She 'd been having a lot of sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? " I went up to my room early . It was hot and humid and I could n't sleep , so I stuck one of Emory Oglethorpe 's cigarettes in my mouth and went out onto the upstairs piazza . But the cigarette hung dead on my lips , for below me I could see the red ends of two other cigarettes and I heard Sally Cato 's voice , low and urgent . " Oh , Beau , " she said , " I know Mame 's nice . Believe me , I love her just as much as you do , but is she right for you ? Beau , honestly , all I want is your happiness . I took it pretty hard when I heard you 'd married her instead of me , but truly , that 's all water over the dam . Mame 's a grand woman , but Beau , does she belong down here ? " 8382 " Mame 's a Yankee , " Beau said stiffly , " and they have different ways from ours . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm her only friend . But Beau , I keep asking myself , can she give you the family , the home , the children that arc a part of our Southern heritage ? Can she , Beau ? " " I do n't know wily not , " Beau said with a note of doubt . " Well , Beau , just remember , your happiness is all I want . I 've got to get up early tomorrow for the bunter trials , so I 'll run along now . Want to give me a little kiss for old times ' sake ? " The cigarettes dropped to the grass and there was no more talking . They just stood there in the shadows , kind of wrapped around each other , and did n't move for a long , long time . Wretchedly I turned away , and as I did , something woolly brushed across my face . I was too frightened to utter a sound . Then a bony hand clutched my arm and a voice whispered , " Come in here , child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hot little room . " Give me a cigarette , " she breathed . " I know you have some , I saw them in your ward-robe . " We smoked in silence . She was a lot better at it than I. " I suppose you heard  --  Beau and that , that dreadful Sally Cato ; ' " I nodded . " Now do you understand ? Now do you see why you 've got to get your aunt out of here  --  and Beau , too ? " I bobbed my head dumbly . " Lord knows I 'm only a poor old spinster  --  no better than a servant in this house and at the beck and call of that terrible old shrew twenty-four hours a ( lay . I have no business saying all this , but Miz Beau is the only person in this whole godforsakencounty who 's ever treated me like a human being . Beau 's a nice boy , too . That 's why you 've got to get them out of here , before it 's too late . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck the whole thing . Every day I hear the two of them up in her bedroom , plotting , plotting , plotting . Do you understand , child ? Do you see ? Get your aunt out of here . Quick , before those two ruin her . Now go to bed , child . Oh , yes , and leave those cigarettes here . " The next day I tried in a bumbling , callow way to warn Auntie Mame about Sally Cato , but I did it so badly that she flew at me in a rage . " What ! " she cried , sitting bolt upright . " I said , Auntie Mame , did you ever stop and think that maybe Sally Cato is n't your friend ? After all , she used to be engaged to Uncle Beau , and she was the one who drew that map and made you kill all those horses , and Emory Oglethorpe says ... " " Emory Oglethorpe says , " she mimicked shrilly , " Emory Oglethorpesays . . . Who cares what that little goat-eyed hellion says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good and ashamed  --  that any nephew of mine could be so small-minded , so petty and rotten as to entertain for one moment such a filthy , vile notion . The idea ! " At that moment Sally Cato 's big Packard roadster was gliding up the drive . " 1lcrc conics Sally Cato now . I will spare you the embarrassment of seeing her . Get out of here and do n't come back until you can think and speak like a gentleman . Sally Cato 's the only real friend I 've got down here , and I wo n't hear another word about her . Now scat ! " Crestfallen , I loped away . I had n't mentioned what had happenedthe night before , because I did n't want to hurt Auntie Mame 's feelings . She loved Uncle Beau an awful lot  --  she must have , or she would n't have put up with life at Peckerwood . But when Sally Cato drove away , Auntie Mame seemed terriblynervous and upset and called me into the Bride 's Cottage . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am I to do now ? " " Do about what ? " " Sally Cato was just here and she 's planning another of those ghastly rodeo things . She says the only way I can redeem myself with the people in the county is to show them what a wonderful horsewoman I am . Now I have to ride and , oh , Pat-85By the time I was dressed next morning I heard hoofs clompingup the drive . The whole county  --  all except those who were still convalescing from Auntie Mame 's last performance on the hunt field  --  was congregated in front of Peckerwood . There were even a few people from across the Carolina border . They seemed less hearty than they had the last time , and there was a malicious , conspiratorial feeling in the air . Somehow Auntie Mame and I did n't give the impression of haute couture . I was wearing a castoff outfit of Emory OglethorpeMcDougall 's and he was nearly a head shorter than I was . From certain angles Auntie Mame looked very dashing in Sally Cato 's broadcloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk hat . But the jacket was a trifle tight here , a trifle loose there , and the skirt dragged a little . Then , too , the size five boots must have been misery . Auntie Mame chain-smoked a lot and took several nips from a silver flask . She tried to seem lighthearted and cheery , but she looked ill at ease , and all the riders eyed her suspiciously . Sally Cato cantered up on a fine big mare , followed by Emory Oglethorpe and a van from Foxglove . There was a terrible amount of stomping and kicking coining from inside the van , and with a good deal of trouble two grooms finally led the biggest , meanest-looking horse I 've ever seen down the runway . Sally Cato kissed Auntie Marne warmly . " How unusual you look this morning , Mame honey , " she said . " Excuse me just a moment , dear , I want to run in and say a word to Mrs. Burn-side . " In a minute she was back . I looked up to the second-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny , unpleasant expression on her face . Sally Cato skipped over to Auntie Mame . " This is the horse I picked especially for you , Mame dear , " she said with a sly smile . " His name is Lightning Rod , and he 's as gentle as a lamb . " Lightning Rod was an Irish hunter , seventeen and a half hands high ; a gelding who 'd never quite reconciled himself to a life of84rick , it was n't true , all that business about my loving horses . I loathe them . " " Why do n't you just admit that you were only kidding , Auntie Maine ? " I said with certain childlike innocence . " Then they wo n't expect you to ride . " " What ! Be made even a worse laughing stock than I am now ? I 'd rattier die ! " " But that 's exactly what may happen to you if you go out on this hunt . " " Better to die iii the saddle , " she said nobly , and shuddered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can always come down with a cold or sprain your ankle again before the hunt . " " But it 's tomorrow , at six o'clock in the morning ! " Uncle Beau was out at a landowners ' meeting that night , and Auntie Mame and I dined silently in the Bride 's Cottage . Auntie Mame was trying to read Fleurs de Mal when the station wagon from Foxglove drove up to the door . Emory Oglethorpe hopped out carrying a big box , a pair of boots , a silk hat , and a leather sidesaddle . " Evenin ' , " he grunted in his nutmeg-grater voice , " ode Sally Cato tol ' me to hustle these hawse duds ovah to yoah Auntie Marne . Man o ' man , you ought a see Sally Cato , she 's whoopin ' an ' hollerin ' all ovah the stables . Sez she vows yoah Auntie Mame ai n't nevah been on so much as a merrygo-round .

" I felt as though the black broadcloth riding habit I carried iu to Auntie Manic were a shroud . She looked aghast and began to tremble . " 011 , Cod , Sally Cato 's sent over the whole outfit . " Then she eyed the sidesaddle . " Am I supposed to sit on that jock strap ? " She began to cry , and she was still weeping softly on her pillow when I went back to the big house. 8786celibacy . He looked at Auntie Marne with blood in his eye and pawed the ground savagely . Sally Cato stroked his muzzle . " He 's a booful olc darlin ' , dat 's wot he is .

That cussed ole plug 's been cockeyed crazy an  --  rtuiuiu ' roue ' the pastcha evah since . ' l'ook six niggahs all yestiddy aftahnoon to ketch hint . " Sally Cato clapped her elegantly gloved hands and said , " Your attention , everyone , we arc now going to have the unique privilege of hunting with one of New York City 's most famous equestriennes , Mrs. Beau Burnside . " She winked maliciously , but not quickly enough for Auntie Mame to miss . Auntie Mamc 's eyes opened wide . There was a ripple of repressed mirth among the riders . Only Beau had an air of innocence . I was already astride a spastic old nag when three grooms led Lightning Rod to the mounting block and Auntie Mame climbed gingerly aboard . I breathed a silent prayer and I noticed that Auntie Mane 's lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field I tried to keep as close as possible to Auntie Mame , but Lightning Rod had a pernicious habit of kicking out behind so that she had the road pretty much to herself . I hoped she would n't be hurt too much when she fell . We ambled along placidly enough , even though I received the distinct iutpression that all clogs , most people , and some horses made I.iglttuing Rod nervous and irritable . Finally we got to the starting place . Lightning Rod whinnied eerily and reared . But surprisingly enough , Auntie Mame stayed on . A couple of the people scented impressed . Sally Cato just sneered . As we were about to start , the Peckerwood station wagon raced up to the field with a scared-looking Negro at the wheel . Miss Fan jumped out and screamed , " Stop ! That horse is mad ! " But she was too late . The fox had been released and was dashingwildly across the meadow , the hounds hot on his trail ; simultaneously , Cousin Van Buren Clay-Pickett and Auntie Mame led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no stoppingher now . I 'd thought surely that Auntie Marne would have the good sense to select a nice soft-looking hummock and throw herself off , but she did n't . Instead , she and Lightning Rod galloped hell-for-leather after Cousin Van Buren . " Gawdlmighty , what a seat Miz Beau has ! " someone shouted . I turned around to see who could be so deranged and my eye caught an expression on Sally Cato 's face that was awful to behold . We raced off , leaving poor old Miss Fan screaming incomprehensiblethings . The old nag I was riding was n't good for much more than glue , but at least it kept up with the pack long enough for me to see Auntie Mamc and Lightning Rod sail over a jagged stone wall that threw two others . Auntie Maine lost her silk hat and her hair floated out wildly , but still she kept on going . " Ja see huh cleah that woll ? " someone called . " That damnyankeegal 's got style . Soopub ltawsewontan . Pufeckly soopub ! " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the springy turf , scraping beneath low-hanging branches , and splashing through muddy creeks . Auntie Manic was out of sight most of the time , and even Uncle Beau and Sally Cato found it impossible to keep up with her . At one point she and Lightning Rod took a sort of detour through a whole field of feeding corn , but still they had no trouble in catching up with the Master of the Hounds . Another time the horse charged into an old lean-to and right out the other side with Auntie Mame still aboard . There was a lot of clucking and squawking and chickens flew out from every direction . In a flash I saw that one old hen , gamer than most , was even perched on Auntie Mame 's shoulder , but the sheer velocity of the wind soon sent it flapping helplesslyinto the air . Once again I lost sight of her when Lightning Rod plungedinto a patch of woods , but Auntie Mame soon appeared again wearing something that looked like a laurel wreath and not even holding the reins . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " do n't she look like a verytibble Greek goddess ! " " I , andagoshen , " another one roared , " she ai n't even hangin ' on . If that do n't beat all ! " ' 1'lien she raced ahead again and disappeared from view . At last we bounded up to a big , fiat plateau overlooking a wide expanse of low green meadow ending abruptly with a high floodwall that ran along the banks of the Savannah River . This was where the hunt must end , unless the poor fox could manage to scale the six-foot wall . By then the fox , the hounds , Van Buren Clay-Pickett , and Auntie Mame were so far ahead that there was no hope of ever catching up , although Beau and Sally Cato McDougall were in hot pursuit about a quarter of a mile behind . Suddenly LightningRod spurted ahead still faster and gave every appearance of trying to overtake Cousin Van Buren . " Ah cai n't unduhstand that Yankee-style huntin ' , " one ofthe men shouted . " Mighty bad fo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't huh fault , " another rider yelled . " That crazy McI ) ongallhawse is runnin ' away with huh , that 's what ! " " Gawdlmighty , yo ' right . " I wanted to shut my eyes tight , but the terrible fascination of the scene before me was too strong . When I opened them again Lightning Rod had not only passed the Master , but the hounds as well , and finally the fox . I lc was a matter of yards from the six foot flooclwall and still he tore onward . " I , awd , he 's goin ' to dash that damnyankee gal to death ! " " Moultrie , All cai n't look ! " the woman next to me screamed , and swooned in her saddle . ' With Auntie Maine still hanging on , Lightning Rod charged the flooclwall . Suddenly his hoofs left the ground and he leaped for the wall , but it was too much for him . His mammoth cheststruck the top and he fell back with a thump that could he heard all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right on going . She cleared the wall by a good four feet and disappeared behind it . There was a terrible splash , and then silence . Another woman swooned but nobody paid any attention . The rest of us raced pell-mell down to the meadow just in time to see Auntie Mame emerge from the Savannah River . Just then a rickety old Chevrolet bounced across the meadow and jolted to a stop . An apoplectic little man jumped out and jogged up to the cluster of panting horses . It was the county veterinarian . " Great day in the mawnin ' , " he shouted , " I bin followin ' this pore little lady fo ' the last half houah . Most amazin ' feat of hawsemanship I evah did see . Why she was n't killed I nevah will know . Well , I thought I reckinized that hawse , an ' now Ah 'm positive . It 's that crazy lightning Rod belongs to Sally Cato McDougall . " Ilis angry blue eyes sought out Sally Cato . " Sally Cato , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hawse was mad . All commanded you to have him shot !

" Sally Cato , it 's you Ah ought a be shootin ' . To let anybody  --  even a soopub hawsewoman like this little lady heap  --  ride on that hawse is tantymount to muhduh . Yes , Ah said plain , premeditated muhduh . You ought a have yo ' name read outta every huntin ' pack in the who ' county . " With one shot he put the pathological Lightning Rod out of his misery and Auntie Mame burst into tears . Uncle Beau swept Auntie Mame up to his saddle and , dirty and wet and scratched as she was , he kept hugging her and kissing her and calling her his Little Yankee Valkyrie . The rest of the members were agog at the glory of Auntie Mame , and I noticed that they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sally Cato as we all ambled back to the field where the pavilion was set up for the Hunt Breakfast . Once Sally Cato reined her horse over toward Uncle Beau's. 90 5 " Beau , " she said urgently , " if you 'll only let me explain . . . " But he gave her a terrible look and cantered ahead with his arms tenderly around Auntie Mame . The Hunt Breakfast was sensational . No one could talk of anything hut Auntie Maine 's magnificent seat . She was christened " Manic , the Huntress , " and everyone toasted her time after time as the greatest horsewoman ever to grace Richmond County . Auntie Maine got awfully high on bourbon , but when 1 finally had a chance to get near her , she held me tight and whispered : " Patrick , darling , tell me , am I still alive ? I got my thigh stuck so tight in that sidesaddle thing I thought I never would fall off . " Cousin Van Buren Clay-Pickett had leaped to the top of the buffet to propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy shambled in with a telegram forAuntie Mame . It read : IMPERATIVE YOU RETURN NEW YORK IMMEDIATELYTO JUDGE INTERNATIONAL HORSE SHOW STOP A DEVOTEDFAN INSISTSTHE COMMITTEE " Oh , dear , " Auntie Mame cried petulantly , hastily gulping down a full tumbler of bourbon . " What a bore . But I suppose we must go back North . Onward and upward , always , you know , to new triumphs on the turf . " IAUNTIE 3IAME , Lady of LettersNor was the Unforgettable Character without literary talent . The article points out that she used to write short little pieces about herself and her everyday life just for fun . She 'd show them to her friends and maybe once in a while even let the local weekly publish one . These little essays , I understand , were perfect masterpieces . In fact , they were so good that publishers were coming up from New York by the carload pleading for a chance to put some of the old girl 's work into print . Personally , I do n't think that 's much to brag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an agent and a secretary before she even put a word on paper . Auntie Mame 's literary career was undertaken more in the way of therapy to bring herself out of the terrible depression she felt as a widow . Her nuptial bliss as Mrs. Beauregard Burnside might have lasted forever , if only Uncle Beau had . Beau was charming , virile , handsome , and rich . He was also generous to a fault . On their first anniversary , Uncle Beau bought Auntie Mame a number of little keepsakes to celebrate the occasion : a big Rolls-Royce , a sable coat , an uncut emerald ring , and a big old mansion on Washington Square to house all the furnitureshe 'd been buying . But the day of their housewarming  --  just thirteen months after they were married  --  Uncle Beau met a poetic end . 1lc was kicked in the head by a horse in Central Park . In an hour he was dead . Auntie Maine was insane with grief . Shc wept and fainted all through the funeral and the ensuing winter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in nothing  --  not even the fact that she was the ninth-richest widow in New York  --  except her considerable sadness . Finally her old chum Vera Charles took pity on her . Vera had struck gold , matrimonially , in England when she married the Honorable Basil Fitz-Hugh . The Hon. Basil was not only rich , he was literary . He even knew Virginia Woolf . Anyhow , Vera decided that a complete change was what Auntie Mame needed . She packed her off to Europe and kept her there for more than two years while I was shunted by Mr. Babcock between St. Boniface and a sordid summer camp . But no one can mourn forever , least of all Auntie Mame . Eventually she came home with some stylish widow 's weeds , a lot of signed photographs of European authors  --  all of whom had helped to dry her tears  --  and a restless yearning for a New Outlet . I was sixteen and discovered that I 'd suddenly shot up to a full six feet . None of my St. Boniface uniforms fitted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of summer freedom standing on a tailor 's block having all my old slacks and blazers let down enough to spare Inv public the sight of as much calf and forearm as possible . When the alterations were completed I had less than a week to spend before the chapel bells of St. Boniface would call me back to another year of macaroni and demerits , and I was kind of hoping that Auntie Marne would make an occasion ofit and take me to the theater and do some of the other things that were fun . I was wrong . When I let myself into her big house on Washington Square , I heard a brisk voice say : " The Ladies ' Home Journal would n't print an episode like that in a million years , Mrs. Burnside . " I tiptoed into the living room and saw Auntie Mame sitting there in a severe black suit , a martini in one hand and a big pair of horn-rimmed spectacles in the other . She had a lot of papers on her lap and she was talking to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a natural for Hollywood , " she was saying . " I thought it might be right for Claudette or maybe Irene , but now I 've decided to play it myself . After all , if I ca n't be myself , who can ? " " Well , Mrs. Burnside , I would n't think too far into the future , " the small redheaded woman said nervously . " No , Mame , " the other woman said . " Elizabeth 's right . You really ought to get something down on paper first to show your publishers . Film sales , serial rights  --  that sort of thing would naturally have to wait . " " Oh , do n't worry about that , my dears , " Auntie Mame sang . " My secretary is upstairs already typing the . . . " I tiptoed out of the room . Upstairs I went into what had always been my room . The place , never too neat during my tenancy , was a sight . There were a lot of steel filing cabinets along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piles of reference books , and papers strewn everywhere . A Dictaphone was squeaking and a harried-looking woman was banging away on a typewriter . I skulked out and went into Auntie Mame 's sitting room . It was n't much better . There were old dance programs , stacks of photographs , back issues of the Buffalo Evening News piled on every surface . Here and there were slips of foolscap with notes that said things like " Tell about night-club raid " and " mention Dr. Cornell and Daddy 's gout . " I lit one of Auntie Mame 's cigarettes and sat down , totally mystified . Then I heard the front door open . Auntie Mame was say-94ing , " Well , ta-ta , my dears . Back to my ecritoire and the midnightoil that gutters low ! I 'll call you in the morning , Mary . We old Buffalo girls must stick together , must n't we ? A bientot ! " The front door closed and I saw the two women collapse into a taxicab . In a moment there was a pretty commotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Agnes , dear , " Auntie Mame was saying , " how ( lid it go ? " " Oh , ever so nicely , I 'm sure , Mrs. Burnside . I 've never been employed in such lovely surroundings before and the work is ever so in-ter-esting . Goodness , when I worked at the Prudential InsuranceCompany we had nothing to type but long legal forms , and Miss Montgomery , she was the supervisor , was always looking over a girl 's shoulder and the class of help they had in the stenographic pool was just awful , and ... " " That 's nice , Agnes , " Auntie Mame interrupted . " And did the cook give you a decent luncheon ? " " Oh , goodness , yes , Mrs. Burnside . We had consomme soupand a gigot of lamb and little petits pois peas and ... " " I low divine , dear . Now , I 'll have Ito drive you home . " " Oh , but Mrs. . . .

" " Well , be that as it may . You 've done a grand day 's work . Now go home . " Auntie Maine burst into the sitting room and threw her arms around me . " Darling , darling boy ! Oh , the feverishexcitement of the creative career ! I 'm driving myself too hard , of course , but I love it . " " What are you talking about ? " I said . " Why , darling , my book . What else ? " " What book ? Who are all these strange women ? " Just then the young woman I 'd seen at the typewriter looked timidly in at the door . " Well , I 'll be saying good night , now . " 95 " Oh , Agnes dear , do come in and meet my nephew . I expect you already know about him , since you were working on that chapter this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you found in the basket on your doorstep , Mrs. Burnside ? " My mouth fell open . " The very one , dear . Patrick , I want you to meet my secretary , my right hand , my severest critic  --  my Alice B. Toklas . Miss Gooch  --  dear Agnes  --  this is nephew Patrick . " " Very pleased to meet you , I 'm sure , " Miss Gooch said , bobbinga little curtsy . I was almost too stunned by what I 'd just heard to take much notice of Miss Gooch , and as a matter of record , there was n't much to notice . Miss Gooch was one of those women who could be anywhere between fifteen and fifty and nobody would care . She had colorless hair , colorless skin , and colorless eyes . She wore rimless glasses and an outsized white angora beret . The rest of her costume consisted of a blue knit jumper , a salmon-colored rayon blouse with balloon sleeves , rayonstockings , and orthopedic oxfords . " How do you do ? " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he the warmest of friends , " Auntie Mame said . " Well , run along , Agnes . A demain ! " " Good-by , now , " Miss Gooch said and disappeared . " You know , my little love , that that poor child  --  she 's just nineteen  --  not only types like an angel and takes shorthand at I-don't-know-how-many thousands of words a minute , but she 's also the sole support of an arthritic mother and a crippled sister . " " You do n't say , " I said . Then I turned and faced her . " What 's all this about finding me in a basket ? " " Oh , darling , you know we writers must occasionally stretch a point to heighten the dramatic situation . So I just said that you were left in a basket at the door of my cottage . " " I was ten years old and you were living in a little cottage on Beekman Place . Now , what is this thing you 're writing ? Who were those women ? What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , my little love , " Auntie Mame said , stretching out on thechaise longue , " I wanted to keep it as a surprise for you until you saw my name at the very top of the best-seller list , but now I may as well confess . I 'm writing my memoirs . " " Why ? " " Why ? Well , I 've had a ve-ry interesting life , and as Lindsay  --  that 's my publisher  --  said to me just the other day when Mary Lord Bishop and I were in signing the contract . . . " " I , iudsay who ? " " Lindsay Woolsey . IIe wishes to publish my work . Oh , my lit- tle love , I ca n't tell you what fate has clone for me ! " " What has it done ? " " Well , last week I was going along Madison Avenue and I saw a face that looked ever so familiar , and just as I was saying to myself , That looks exactly like Bella Shuttleworth from Dela- ware Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are n't you Mame Dennis from Delaware Avenue in Buffalo ? ' Well , we threw our arms around each other like long-lost friends  --  which indeed we were  --  and dashed into the Plaza for a drink . Well , we got talk- ing about the old days of the Delaware Avenue Irregulars and the jolly rousts we used to have at Miss Rushaway 's School out near Soldier 's Place and one thing and another  --  la , those gay old days iii Buffalo !  --  and Bella said Would n't it be fun if she were to give a dinner party for the old Buffalo crowd who were here in town . So she did . My , but Bella 's put on weight ! " " Go on , " I said . " Wcll , she gave a very nice dinner . Saddle of mutton . Tough . And she had Mary Lord Bishop -- you saw her here today  --  who 's a very important literary agent , and Lindsay Woolsey and his wife  --  she was a mousy little thing from around Colonial Circle - and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she had a bad cold and could n't conic , malheureusement . Well , it was a terribly gay evening , and I suppose I did have an awful lot to drink , but I got to telling Lindsay all about what I 'd been doing since I left Buffalo and he was ever so amused and all of a sudden he said , Marne , why do n't you write a book ? ' And then Mary Lord Bishop said , Why , yes , why do n't you ? ' So I simply thought , Well , why the hell not ? Then we all got to talking about it and the high old times we used to have with the boys in the Saturn Club and Lindsay Woolsey said , Marne , you could absolutely put Buffalo on the map ! ' And Mary Lord Bishop said that even if it was already on the map , any book I wrote would be terribly unusual and she 'd be happy to represent me as an agent . So the three of us put our heads together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Cunning . " " Well , I 've only been at it for a couple of days , but you saw how enthused Mary and Elizabeth were this afternoon . My life in the magazines , the newspapers , as a movie , and translated in God-knows-how-many foreign languages . " " That certainly will be exciting , " I said . " Exciting ! Oh , darling , I can hardly breathe , I 'm so thrilled . Now I must dress . " I could hear Auntie Maine 's voice singing " Buffalo Gal , wo n't you step out tonight , step out tonight , step out tonight , " and I knew that she was launched on a new endeavor . During the last days I spent at home I worked so hard for Auntie Mame 's literary career that St. lioniface  --  prayers and allbeganto look pretty good . She kept Miss Gooch and me hopping every minute . She made me go to the Public Library to do historicalresearch , and when I asked her if she remembered PresidentMcKinley 's assassination during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . I was almost happy to return to St. Boniface for another year of school . During the fall term Auntie Mame wrote almost every day , exceptnow she dictated most of her letters to Agnes Gooch . Each one was a paean of praise to her own literary talents . When Auntie Mame was too busy to write herself , Agnes Gooch took over and wrote abysmal letters about Auntie Mame 's career . She also crocheted an ecru dresser scarf for my room at school and sent a box of gritty fudge which sister Edna had cooked . For all of Auntie Mame 's talk about her book , I 'd never read a word of Buffalo Gal , subtitled The Personal History of a ModernGeorge Sand , nor had anyone else . But around November a thick bundle of manuscript arrived . It was one of many copies of the book which the untiring Agnes Gooch had typed . No one could deny that Auntie Mane 's was a big book . It ran just shy of nine hundred typewritten pages , but no matter how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Auntie Mane was a fascinating talker , knew a lot of interesting people , and had excellent taste in her own reading , her prose style was that of a gifted amateur  --  a bit too florid , a bit too irresponsible , and often unconsciously funny . She had also been too scrupulous a reporter and told much more than was absolutely necessary about some of her dearest friends . So it did n't take half an eye to see that , rich as she was , she would be a complete pauper after the libel suits started pouring in . All in all , Buffalo Gal , while interesting , was a lousy book . I was sitting down to write her a polite but dishonest letter of congratulation when a telegram arrived at St. Boniface . It said : COME HOME I 'M DYINGAUNTIE MAMEWhen I rushed into the house on Washington Square , Agnes Gooch , white-lipped and more pallid than ever , greeted me at the door . " Goodness , Patrick , I 'm so glad you 've come . Poor Mrs. Burnside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at me balefully through her glasses and snuffled . " I have n't even been home since Wednesday and my sister Edna has had to do all the housework and Mumsie ... " " What 's the matter with Auntie Mame ? " I demanded . " Oh , Pat rick ! 1 lcr book  --  her publisher 's rejected it ! " " Is that all ? " " Oh , but it 's serious . They 're up there now  --  Mr. Woolsey , her publisher , and her agent , Mrs. Bishop . They told me  --  in the strictest confidence  --  that they want to get her a ghost writer . Oh , she 's so hurt ; and Mumsie and Edna and I thought the book was just lovely . So glamorous . The . . . the ghost man is coining any minute now . She 'll be so glad to have some loved one , like you , at her side in this crisis . " As I ran upstairs I could hear voices in Auntie Mame 's bedroom . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudest of all . " . . . and as for you , Mary Lord , what do you mean , my manuscript does n't ring true ? " " Auntie Mame , " I said , " I 'm home . " " Darling , " she cried from her bed , spreading her arms dramaticallywith a flutter of scalloped chiffon sleeves . " At last you 've come to stand by me while these literary vultures pick at the poor bones of my life 's work . Sit by me here on the bed and let me draw from your young strength . " " Now , Mame , do n't you think you 're overstating the case ? " Mary Lord Bishop said logically . Mrs. Bishop was trying to retainher impressive placidity , but it was a losing fight . " Now , Mame , " Mr. Woolsey said , " cursing Mary and me is n't going to get Buffalo Gal written properly , or make it any more salable . " Mr. Woolsey , who was ordinarily both dapper and diplomatic , was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can talk this out . " " Oh , yes , " Auntie Marne roared , " we can talk . Talk , talk , talk , that 's all you and Mary seem to be able to do . You talked me into writing this book , now you want to talk me out of it just because it happens to be work of serious literary consideration . Well , you ca n't talk me out of my convictions , Lindsay Woolsey , and neither can anybody else who was born on Linwood Avenuewith the rest of the Buffalo parvenus ! " " But , Mame , " Mr. Woolsey wheedled , " we have n't rejected Buffalo Gal . We simply feel that you need some outside help . We still think it 's a splendid idea . " " Oh yes , Lindsay , " Mrs. Bishop said nervously , " just short of being brilliant , but like so many ama  --  that is  --  new writers , Mame needs a little editorial assistance to guide her over the rough100 spots . And I feel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a word here and there , do a little judicious cutting ... " " Yes , " Mr. Woolsey said , " cutting is of the essence . " " .. .

Now I 'm to have a ghost writer  --  some unspeakable little hack to twist and distort the meaning and the ethos of my life . " " Maine , " Mrs. Bishop said patiently , " it would n't be a ghost writer . IIe 'd be more of an editor ... " " A sort of literary adviser , would n't you say , Mary ? " " Who ? " Auntie Mame asked viciously . " Well , Elizabeth and I know of a particularly capable young man who 's done quite a lot of this work and he could do a per- fectly grand job of reworking your book . I saw him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that your material was captivating . " " He did ? " Auntie Mame said , coming out of her sulk . " Yes indeed . He said you had one of the most astonishing capacities for invention he 'd ever seen . " " Really ? " Auntie Maine said . " What did you say his name was ? " " It 's Brian O'Bannion . He 's a . . . " " 011 , God deliver mc ! " Auntie Mame moaned . " I can see him now  --  one of t hose beery , loose-mouthed Irish tenors , with a lot of quaint repartee . " " Now , that 's not fair , Maine , " Mrs. Bishop said stolidly . " As a matter of fact , he 's a very good poet . He wrote that volume called ' I7ic ' Wounded Tulip for ... " " Probably pansy , " Auntie Mame muttered . " And besides , Manic , he 's ( lone a great deal of this work be- fore , he knows the market , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you think I 'm going to have some moon-eyed , epicene versifier messing up my memoirs with a lot of miserable Irish wit you 're just crazy . I 'd rather take my book and flush it down the toilet than undergo the ennui and mortification of ... " Miss Gooch 's shapeless shape appeared at the bedroom door . " Mr. O'Bannion is here , Mrs. Burnside . " We all looked up , and there stood Brian O'Bannion . Auntie Mame let out a short , breathless little gasp . From what she had been saying , I 'd expected a little , low-comedy Irishman ; a sort of funny-paper Jiggs out of Lady Gregory . Instead , Brian O'Bannion was what is known as White Irish . He was about thirty , tall , and very thin . He had white , white skin and hair as black as coal , short and very curly . His eyes were turquoiseblue , rimmed with thick black eyelashes , and the second I saw them I thought of a Siamese tomcat . He was got up awfullytweedily in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dirty trench coat thrown over one slhoulder . Ile shifted his weight gracefully in the doorway and gave Auntie M Lame a slow , sad smile displaying a fine set of choppers , while his intense blue eyes reached out  --  in a manner of speaking  --  and caressed her . Auntie Mame swallowed , her hands fidgeted with the bodice of her bed sacque . She smiled charmingly and said , " Do come in , Mr. O'Bannion . We were just talking about you . " Mr. O'Bannion walked  --  or perhaps a better word would be slunk  --  into the room , and I thought of a cat stalking some sort of prey . While Mary Lord Bishop was introducing her agency 's propertyaround , Auntie Mame snatched feverishly for her compact , took a reassuring glance , and then said graciously : " Do sit down right here where I can see you , Mr. O'Bannion . It 's so awfully kind of you  --  a really renowned pao-wet  --  to lend a hand with my childishlittle scribblings . " He gave her the old hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me , " she said , her smile matchinghis , " do you think that you and I can ever get anyplace ? With the book , I mean . " Mr. O'Bannion turned on the soft , sad smile once more and said in his deep , mellifluous voice , " I know that you and I are going to create something wonderful . " 102 That afternoon I was sent back to St. Boniface with the report that Auntie Mame was recovering nicely . I hardly heard a word from Auntie Mdme for the next month and when I did , it seemed that the word was always Brian . " . . . Brian and I have just been for a brisk tramp over the moors of Oyster Bay . Like Brian , I always do my best thinking in the crisp , clean out of doors . . . " or " . . . it 's past midnight and Brian and I have just been sitting around the fire reading Yeats and watching the smoke curl up from his pipe . . . " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being with Brian has given me a new interpretation of my entire girlhood . I ca n't tell you what it means having a man around the place after all these months with that dreary Agnes . " Even at a distance I began to get the idea . Miss Gooch took to writing me on her own hook , too . She kept saying that Auntie Mame 's memoirs , in collaboration with Brian , were coming very slowly , but what little had been written was simply enthralling . She was a little less effusive about Auntie Marne , but she had only praise for Mr. O'Bannion . Goodness , she could n't wait for my Christmas holidays , when she and Auntie Manic and dear Mr. O'Bannion and I would all be together to make up a jolly foursome . At what , she did n't say . I had the feeling that I could wait a long time , but Christmas eventually arrived . " , Missy Burnside out with Irishman , but Missy Foureyes up- stairs , " Ito said as he let Inc into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found her sobbing over a copy of Brian 's book of poems , The Wounded Tulip . " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " Goodness , " she said , dropping The Wounded Tulip and stum- bling out of her chair , " I did n't think you 'd be arriving so early . " She sniffled horridly . " Pardon me , please , I seem to of mislaid my hankie . " I gave her my own . " Here , " I said . " Blow . " " Thank you very much . I hope you 'll forgive my silly show of emotion , but Bri  --  Mr. O'Bannion 's  --  poems are all so bc-yuty-ful thatI ... " I heard the front door close downstairs and Auntie Mame 's voice call , " Darling , are you home ? " I could see that a change had come over Auntie Mame as I trotted down the stairs . She 'd had her second-best mink coat made into a reversible : Irish homespun on the outside , mink inside . She was wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-footlongEton scarf . She reeked of peat bogs . " What are you got up as ? " I said blankly . " Oh , Brian and I have been out tramping the moors , thinking . " Brian gave me the glad eye and sad smile . IIc was wearing gray tweed , the first Tattersall waistcoat I 'd seen off the stage , and a Trinity College ( Dublin ) tie . " Awf'ly glad to sec you agayne , Paddy . " " Well , time for tea , darlings , " Auntie 1lame sang . Brian slithered off to the bathroom . ' then she turned to mc and kissed me . " Oh , my little love , it 's so good to have you home for Christmas ; to have you here when Auntie Manre is so busy , so creative , so productive , so utterly , utterly happy ! " I felt kind of embarrassed and I said : " How 's the book ? " " Oh , darling , " Auntie Manic said , " I feel that I 've learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the veriest amateur , who thought that one should rush at the muse . But now I find that writing is truly a deep and exquisite experience . " " How much have you got done ? " " Nearly twenty pages . " " Only twenty pages ? " I said . " Really , Patrick , " Auntie Mame said , " you know nothing of the true creative process . Ninety-nine per cent of the work is in the thinking , and dear Brian has brought my brain alive ! " " Oh ? " " Yesss , darling . " She lowered her voice . " And , Patrick , I want you to get to know Brian . To know him as I do  --  or almost as I104 105women can never understand what men see in their more widely sought-after sisters , neither could I explain what Brian had to offer . Not only did he weigh under a hundred and fifty pounds , but he was also a lecher , a cheat , a liar , and , what is still worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed in the equally uninspiring company of Miss Agnes Gooch , who said three times a day : " Goodness , is n't it amazing how a year goes by ! Why , it seems only yesterday that Mumsie and Edna and I were undoing our Christmas things  --  we always save the ribbons and press them out for next year  --  and here it is again ! " Christmas was very merry and Auntie Mame outdid herself at being Irish  --  or at least North of Ireland . Yule logs burned in every fireplace until it got so hot that we had to open all the windows . Brian slunk in , all Glenurgnliart plaid , and Agnes took the subway in from Kew Gardens , after a beautiful Christmas morning with Mumsie and Edna . She was radiant in a dress she 'd made herself of a particularly taxing shade of mustard wool with beadwork over the bosom , and she brought gifts of her own manufacturefor each of us . Shc gave me a scarf she 'd knitted in St. Boniface Academy colors , and she presented Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Igor Brian she had worked a pair of carpet slippers in petit point with shamrocks and his initials , and he rewarded her with such a devastating smile that her knees buckled . Auntie Mame gave Agnes a kiss , a plain white envelope , and a length of green homespun , which , considering the handiwork Agnes had just brought forth , was a terrible mistake . Auntie Mame gave Brian a kiss , a plain white envelope  --  thicker than Agnes '  --  and a beautiful Bentley two-seater which stood low and rakish at the curb outside . He was too stunned even to smile . She gave me a kiss , a plain white envelope , two of the tweediest jackets ever created , a pair of stout brogues so heavy that I could hardly lift them from the floor , a Tattersall waistcoast , anddo . You like him , do n't you ? And , darling , " she said , kissing the top of my head , " if he should ever mention age  --  that is , ask you how old .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 're twelve . Is n't lie virile ? " Auntie Maine whispered , clutching my arm as lie carne hack into the room . The picture was getting clearer. ' lea that day and dinner following were unusual events , to say the least . It was interesting and a little horrible to watch Auntie Manic and Agnes Gooch make such asses of themselves over Ita Ian . Agnes , her sallow skin , her lank , lackluster hair , her rimlessglasses , her baggy boucle knit dress in just the wrong shade of blue , the vulgar exactitude of her speech , was pathetic as the poor , plain little typist mooning over a handsome man ten years her senior . While Auntie Mame , the perfection of her flesh , her beautifully coiffed head , her magnificent figure , her glowing eyes , her flawless clothes with all the right jewels , her casual , lightheartedcharm , was ludicrous as the rich , elaborate , aging belle mooning over a handsome man ten years her junior . I did n't see much of Auntie Mame that season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of Brian . She practically threw us together  --  against my will and , I 'm certain , against his . One day she made him take me for a brisk hike in Central Park while she had her hair done . The day was memorable only for its discomfiture , Brian 's herringbone tweeds , and the fact that he literallylicked his chops when he came across a prettyish nursemaidwheeling a baby carriage near Seventieth Street . Another day Auntie Mame decided that Brian and I should revel in one another 's company amidst the medieval splendor of the Cloisters . The afternoon was dismal . My feet hurt , the Cloisters smelled just like the locker room at St. Boniface Academy , and Brian , instead of admiring the delicately painted virgins from obscureItalian convents , was slobbering after two rather garishly touched-up virgins from I-iunter College who eluded him  --  with appreciative giggles  --  among the sarcophagi of the twelfth century . I got some hint as to Brian 's extraordinary appeal , but as100 I 107a box of seven pipes marked " Sunday , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Thursday , " " Friday , " and " Saturday . " In short , everything I needed , except a Bentley car , to be a junior Brian O'Bannion . Brian gave each of us an autographed copy of The Wounded Tulip . Then we all had a heavy dinner and Auntie Mame said she thought it would be just divine if I were to take Agnes to the Radio City Music I la to see a rousing good film and that lovely , lovely Christmas pageant of the Nativity . Although I vastly preferred Agnes to Brian , I found her wholesomegarrulousness just as tiring as his unhealthy silence . Still , she meant well , which was more than one could say of him . All the way uptown in the taxi Agnes jabbered away about goodness , what a sweet , dear man Brian was , and how she 'd just love to take him home to Mumsie and Edna and put some meat on his bones ; and goodness , what a lovely , lovely Christmas it had been and did n't I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow laid all the germs . Because it was Christmas I walked Agnes down to the Algonquinfor a drink after the show . Agnes was favorably impressed with the rather fusty stateliness of the Algonquin lounge and she was also pleased to see that the patrons merely sat about in armchairs and sofas to do their drinking . " Goodness , " she said , " it 's so refined . Just like a lovely home instead of sonic tavrun . " She told me three times how strict Mninsic was about liquor and made me promise to buy her some Sen-Scn to nnmch going home to Kew Gardens . Then she ordered something called a Pink Whiskers , which made the waiter blanch . Ilcr drink looked kind of nasty to me , but she sipped it ostentatiously , still wearing her gloves and with a great crooking of her little finger , and pronounced it extremely refreshing . She belched softly and said something mystifying about the Gay White Way and the Four hundred . My mind was a thousand miles away , but I was suddenlysnapped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieked : " Oh , baby , that sets me on fire ! Let 's have another ! " Then , for some unaccountable reason , she added : " Hotcha ! " The waiter said , " Does your aunt know you 're out ? " " Really , " I said , " Miss Gooch is my aunt 's Alice B. Toklas . " " Certainly , my good man , " Agnes giggled , " do n't be ridic . " Then she wrinkled up her nose and added , " You 're cute . " I had just strength enough left to order Agnes another drink . " I do n't know so awfully much about liquor and most of it tastes like medicine to silly old me , but this girl  --  Phyllis  --  at the Prudential used to tell me about the Pink Whiskers cocktails her boy friend ordered for her . He was in hardware . Anyhoo , the name sounded so cute I just thought I 'd try one . " The second Pink Whiskers arrived and the waiter had hardly set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to me that her friend Phyllis should also have told her that when drinking , it 's endurance , not speed , that counts . " Goodness , I feel so gay and light and young and happy I could just dance ! " Then she said " I hitch ma ! ' ' again . " Agnes , " I said quickly , " I do n't think the Algonquin has an orchestra . " " I 'm just going to see a man about a dog , " Agnes shrilled . Then she leaned over and bit my ear . " Be a peacherino and gemme another Pink Whiskers . " I was so shaken by the Jekyll and Hyde transformation in Miss Gooch that I was only able to tap the bell and ask for another Pink Whiskers . The waiter looked at me sternly and said : " If it was n't fer yer aunt , I would n't serve that dame no more . They 're the worst kind , them schoolteacher ones . " Agnes returned almost sooner than I wanted her to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powder . " You 're cute , " she said as she settled on the divan . In a frenzy , I tried to change the subject . " Tell me , Agnes , " 108 I said , " how 's the book coming ? When do you think Auntie Marne and Brian 'll be finished ? " She took off her glasses and banged them on the table so hard that I looked down surreptitiously to see if she had broken them . " Lisssen , " she snarled , " if you were locked in a room with Brian would you he in any hurry to get out ! " I fought down the impulse to say , " For God 's sake , yes . " She snorted and pulled off her orange tam-o ' - shanter , then she stared up at me long and hard . Ilcr eyes , instead of being color- less , were a deep , glorious gray and they were enormous . Her hair had come a trifle loose , and even with her blue matte-finish nose planted defiantly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment  --  almost beautiful . " Lissenamee , Mrs. Burnside ca n't take her eyes off of Brian . It 's disgusting . It 's aw- ful . Why , she 's old enough to be his mother ... " " Well , I would n't say that , " I began loyally . " And . . . and oh , I love him so-o-o-o ! " Agnes collapsed into noisy sobs , stopping just long enough to say , " Gemme another Prink Whiskeys . " Then she tottered back to the powder room . The trip home was a nightmare . Agnes was all over me , moan-r ' ing , " Brian Brian , Brian , I love you , I want you . " " Want I should take yez to a ho tel buddy ? " the driver asked as we reached Fifth Avenue . " Yes , yes , for God 's sake , yes ! " Miss Gooch moaned . " You go where I told you ! " I roared at the driver . Then Agnes got a hammer lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . 1 'd recently been the recipient of a pretty definitive kiss , delivered by a torrid brunette from Miss Walker 's , but Agnes ' alma mater , the Lillian Rose Dowdey Institute of Ap plied Business Technique , apparently offered things in its cur- riculum that made Miss Walker 's girls seem dim by comparison . I do n't know where , or if , Miss Gooch learned to make love , but she certainly had some advanced ideas . I carried Agnes into Auntie Mame 's house and up to the guest room where she slept whenever she stayed in town . With a good deal of tugging , and with several of her loving stitches giving , I removed the mustard wool dress and dumped her on the bed , unlaced the health oxfords , and took off her glasses . Her hair looked quite pretty when it fell loosely onto the pillow . As a matter of fact , I 'd never noticed before , but Agnes had a damned good figure . She lay there in the lamplight absolutely gassed , but not half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Take me , " she moaned as I pulled the comforter up over her , " take me , Brian , for God 's sake , take me . " I was breakfasting alone the next morning when Agnes crept in . I did n't have to ask her how she felt . " G-goodness , " she said , " I really must apologize for my behaviorlast evening . I think I must of eaten something that did n't agree with me . Tell me , did I do anything  --  say anything  --  last night that was n't , uh , ladylike ? " Just to show her that chivalry was n't quite dead I said , " Believe me , Agnes , you were perfectly fine . " " Oh , I 'm so glad . " Then she excused herself quickly . Brian arrived about eleven , and Auntie Manie came bounding down the stairs dressed vaguely like Sherlock Holmes in a hound'stoothchecked suit and a great Inverness cape . " Hoop-la ! " she caroled , " off to break in the new car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patrick , my little love , be an angel and ask Ito if our hamper is ready . " The day was damp and the cold was severe . " Are you going out in that open car on a day like this ? " I asked . " But of course , darling ! A good brisk tramp over the moors really makes the blood sing in one 's veins . You know , we Celts are hardy ! " Shivering slightly , I watched Auntie Mame and Brian drive off . Then I went upstairs to suggest an ice bag to Miss Gooch . I was dressing to go to a dance when Auntie Mame and BrianIt 's my right to be at Lindsay 's . After all , I am one of his authors . Important people from the whole world of letters will be there to meet me , to discuss my book  --  and where will I be ? I 'll be right here in bed with my Kleenex and croup kettle . And Brian was looking forward to it so . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor darling 's so shy , he would n't have any fun at all without me to guide him around . " I was n't so sure . " Gee , Auntie Mame , that 's too bad , " I said , and went downstairs to where Brian was practically pawing a hole through the drawing-room carpet , ignoring Miss Gooch who sat seductively on the sofa , her eyelashes fluttering behind her spectacles . The day of Lindsay Woolsey 's New Year 's Eve party arrived to find Auntie Mame still confined to bed . To make matters even worse , licr agent telephoned about lunchtime and said that she certainly hoped Aniitic Manic and Brian would be at the party that night because a very important producer from MGM had evinced great interest iii Buffalo Gal and she simply knew that Auntie Nlaiue could charm him into an outright sale  --  preferably sight unseen . Auntie Mame wailed : " Oh , Mary , how too ghastly . I ca n't . how really dreadful ! " There was some more spluttering over the phone and then Auntie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't send dear Brian alone . In the first place , he 's terribly shy , and then the poor lamb is so innocent ! He has none of my business acumen . He 'd be lost . " There was some more gabbling and then Auntie Maine said : " No , Mary , that 's out of the question . I tell you , I do n't know any unattached women , at least not the sort of woman I 'd trust . " Mrs. Bishop talked some more and then Auntie Mame said : " Mary , the whole problem is insoluble . I just do n't know any single woman I could get now at the eleventh hour . You 'll simply have to .. : got home . Auntie Mame looked terribly flushed . She did n't seem to have benefited much from her tramp across the moors , and she sat huddled by the fire drinking hot Irish whisky . Her eyes were unnaturally bright , and when I bent down to kiss her good-by her face felt as though it were in flames . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the doctor described as a cold so bad that it was almost pneumonia . Poor Auntie Maine was a sight . IIcr face was swollen to about twice its size . Hcr eyes ran piteously . IIcr nose was crimson , and every sentence was punctuated by violent spasms of coughing and sneezing . For two days she lay in bed and moaned while Miss Gooch hovered in attendance . Brian came to the house every morning , but Auntie Mame refused to let him see her . " I ca n't let him up here , Agnes , " she 'd moan , woefully surveying her red nose and sneezing . She sneezed again , took another incredulous look at her reflection , and rolled over in her big gold bed . Agnes scampered around the house running errands , making phone calls , attending the croup kettle in Auntie Mame 's room . Down in the library Brian made a weak stab at writing a bit of Buffalo Gal , but most of the time he paced the floor . He reminded me of nothing so much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter . Meals with Brian and Miss Gooch were a terrible ordeal . Every clay she was a little sallower , a little more elegantly kittenish ; and every day he fidgeted more and more , until I was on the verge of dosing his soup with saltpeter , like the cook did at St. Bonifacc . Auntie Manic was getting better , but the doctor demanded that she stay in bed for at least another week . This put her in a fury , however , since she 'd been looking forward to the big New Year 's Eve party which her publisher was giving . " Oh , Patrick , darling , " she fumed , " what have I done to deservea fate so cruel ? I-Iere I 've been planning to go to Lindsay 's for months and now I ca n't . Really , I 'm so mad I could just cry . I do n't know to this day quite what got into me , but seeing poor Agnes sitting on the chaise longue crocheting an antimacassarand looking sad and virtuous , I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamc ? " I asked . " Do n't be facetious , " Auntie Maine said . Then she glanced at Agnes . It was the kind of look a nervous mother gives to a nursemaidshe 's just engaged to handle a problem child  --  a look of relievedapproval . " Just a minute , Mary , " Auntie Mame said into the mouthpiece . Then she turned to Agnes . " Agnes , dear , what are your plans for this evening ? " " Oh , goodness , Mrs. Burnside , nothing much I guess . On New Year 's Eve Mumsie and Edna and I usually have ginger ale and some of Edna 's brownies , then we tune in the radio and hear the New Year being celebrated in one of the big hotels in New York and then an hour later in Chicago and then in Denver and finally at the Cocoanut Grove in California . Why , last year Gary Cooper ... " " I have other plans for you this year . Hello , Mary , do n't worry . My secretary can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply could n't ! " Agnes cried . " The only thing I have to wear is my old peach organdie and I just would n't have the time to make anything now and ... " " That may be all to the good , Agnes , " Auntie Mame said . " I have tons of things you could squeeze into . Mary , victory is ours ! Agnes can shepherd Brian around . With a little fixing up Agnes will be adequate . I 'm sending them to the theater first , but they 'll be there about eleven . . . happy New Year to you , too . Good-by . " She hung up . " Agnes , " Auntie Manic said , fixing her with a beady eye , " put down that tatting and come here . We have n't a second to lose . " " Oh , Mrs. Burnside , I simply could n't ever ... " " Agnes , take off your clothes . " " But , Mrs. Burnside , Patrick is . . . " " Would you ladies like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . On a project like this , I want all the help I can get . Besides , I need a man 's critical eye to guide me when it comes to creating a new Agnes . Do n't be such a goose , Agnes , shell out of that serge sack and be quick about it . " Miss Gooch timidly removed her dark blue dress . " A little broad in the beam , perhaps , " Auntie Mame said with the critical tone of a horse trader , " but nothing that a good girdle ca n't fix . Heavens , Agnes , you do have a bust . Where on earth have you been keeping it all these months ? Now , go to my dressingroom and open the third door and we 'll see what sort of eveningthing will do the most for you . " Miss Gooch trudged virginally across the room in her white slip and her orthopedic shoes and returned with an armload of brilliantevening dresses . " Put down that red one this instant , Agnes ! " Auntie Mame said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to dominateit . No , dear , that lime green makes you look like a jaundice case . I think we 'd better stick to black ; nobody ever got into any trouble with it . Here , that one , that good , tight , form-fitting Paton velvet . You have a nice little figure , Agnes  --  with a bit of trussing here and there  --  and there 's no reason to be ashamed of it . Here , just wriggle into this . Patrick , for Cod 's sake , child , fasten her up the back . Where 's your gallantry ? " Even with her plain white slip showing over the top of the black velvet evening dress , Agnes looked pretty good , if you did n't noticeher face and her hair . She did have a form . " Yes , " Auntie Manic said authoritatively , lighting a Kool . " That 's it . That 's the dress . Now take it off and have a bath . Mercy , girl , I do wish we could do something to wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , it 's a little late in the day to try anything so drastic . But go into my bathroomand you 'll see a jar of Lydia van Rensselaer Skin-Glo . Simply slather it over yourself . It may sting for awhile but it 's worth the agony . Patrick , go run Agnes a good hot tub and dump in a lot of van Rensselaer Oil of Orchid . And Agnes , forGod 's sake , shave under your arms . You Iook like King Kong . " I could hear Agnes whimpering with the pain of the Skin-Glo in the bathroom , but except for yelling " Shut up , Agnes , " Auntie Marne paid no attention . Eventually Agnes emerged , glowing like a red-hot rivet . She 'd forgotten her glasses . " Why , Agnes , " Auntie Maine cried delightedly , " you have lovely eyes ! Just leave those glasses off  --  forever . " " But I ca n't see anything with my right eye , Mrs. Burnside , and ... " " Look out of the left one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Oh , Mrs. Burnside , I can sit on my hair ! " " What a ridiculous thing for anyone to do . Well , if you wo n't let me cut it , you wo n't . But we could make it interesting . Come here , dear . Will you hold still ! " The project took more than six hours , and Agnes whined and whimpered with every pat of the powder puff , with every tweak of the eyebrow tweezers and every stroke of the mascara brush . It was nearly eight when the transformation was complete . Agnes stood tall and stately , if a little unsteadily , in Auntie Mame 's high-heeled slippers . She kept squinting incredulously into the mirror , and even though she could n't see her reflection very well , both Auntie Manic and I told her several times that she was a stunner . " Now , Agnes , " Auntie Mame said , " you look divine . Really svelte . So when you get there I do n't want you to act the ingenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in Kew Gardens , do n't tell them about Mumsie and Edna  --  sterling women though they undoubtedly are . In fact , talk just as little as possible . Mary Lord Bishop will do the talking , that 's what she gets her commission for . You just try to look stylish and intelligent , and every time the MGM man asks you a question about my book  --  our book  --  you tell him it 's simply wonderful and bound to becomea classic ; which it is . All you really have to do is to look after Brian . " At the mention of Brian 's name I felt my stomach drop . " Auntie Mame , " I spluttered , " maybe it would be better if you let Mrs. Bishop handle the movie man alone . After all , New Year 's Eve means a lot to Mrs. Gooch and Edna , and you and Brian and I could play records right here and ... " " Have you taken leave of your senses , child ? " Auntie Mame said indulgently . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out among important lit'ry figures . That 's what Agnes is for : to take care of Brian when I ca n't . Besides , this is your idea . " " Oh , Mrs. Burnside , " Agnes wailed , " I just ca n't do it . I 'm so nervous already I 'm about to break out in press-peration . " " Not in my evening dress you 're not , Agnes Gooch . What you need is a little something to calm your nerves . Patrick , bring up some champagne . It 'll do us all good . " My blood ran cold . " Auntie Maine , do you really think we ought to have anything to drink ? Agnes . .. " " Well , you 're certainly becoming frugal of my champagne , I must say . Do as I tell you and none of your impudence . " " Oh , Mrs. Burnside , I really do n't think I should dr .. " Auntie Mame , " I cried , " if Agnes does n't want a drink ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will relax you . " Although Auntie Manic was rarely guilty of understatement , she 'd really pulled off a classic . To give poor Miss Gooch her due , she sipped the first glass of champagne as though it were hemlock and said something tiresomeabout the bubbles tickling her nose . But my heart sank when Auntie Mame insisted that she drink another . Just then I heard the doorbell ring , and looking out of the window , I saw Brian 's elegant new Bentley . " Oh , Agnes , " Auntie Mame cried girlishly , " let 's give Mr. O'Bannion a big surprise . IIe still thinks I 'm going to the party , but Patrick will announce you and you 'll come sweeping in . Quick , go hide in my dressing room . And here , take a glass of champagne in with you . " I felt I was witnessing the fall of Western civilization . All men look their best in white tic , but Brian was really something . When he saw Auntie Maine propped up decorously in her gold bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Inc a little sick. " lint  --  but the theater . . . the party ? " he said . " Are n't you read ? " Ill ( lading , " Aunt is 1Ianie pouted , " the doctor wo n't let Inc go , so I 'm sending a substitute . " " A substitute ? " he said . " Who ? " " Oh , " Auntie Mame cried , going all over kittenish , " someone you know  --  a very nice girl . It 's Agnes ! " " Not . . . not Agnes ? " The tomcat eyes stopped glowing and he looked like he 'd just been stabbed . " Well , " Auntie Mame cooed , " not precisely the same Agnes . Patrick , bring on the new Miss Gooch ! " Woodenly , I threw open the dressing-room door and out stepped Agnes . She looked terrific , although her eyes were a little glazed . However , I had n't seen Brian 's  --  his bright blue stare was really frightening . " Is n't she lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed , and I saw his pointed pink tongue dart over his lips . " Well , run along , you two . Have a glorious time . Ta-ta , my dears . Have fun ! " Agnes reached the door , turned , and stared blindly back into the room ; then she smiled enigmatically and said : " Hotcha ! " After the front door closed , Auntie Mame said , " Well , another problem solved . My , but did n't Agnes look stunning ! I never dreamed she had so many possibilities . Poor little mouse . I really did a job on her , did n't I ? But really , darling , you know with a girl like Agnes it 's just wasted effort . " " What do you mean ? " I said . " Oh , you know . She 's sweet , but she has no fire . That girl simplyhas no sex drive . Well , " she said , " here we arc , alone to-gether on New Year 's Eve . We can just have a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask you , anyway . Just stir up the fire and run down for some more champagne and then we 'll be just as snug as . . . " She sneezed and made an airy gesture with her Kleenex . " New Year 's Eve , " she began , with a dreamy expression . " La , the memories ! You know , your Uncle Beau and I were married on New Year 's Eve  --  just three years ago tonight . " She blew her nose , either from emotion or her head cold . " Did n't we all have a lark when dear Beau was alive , darling ? " " Yes , we certainly did , " I said honestly . " You know , it 's been awfully hard for me these last two years  --  a widow , alone and lonely in the world . " " I know . " " Of course , I have you and this house and more money than I 'll ever need , but that is n't quite the same , is it , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really loved Uncle Beau . " " Everyone did . A fine , great specimen of a man . Those big brown eyes and those masses of heavenly red-gold hair on his chest . Well , " she sighed , " talking about him wo n't bring him back , more 's the pity . Yet I feel this empty aching void  --  here , " she said , indicating a well-rounded breast , " for someone like dear Beau . " I knew what was coming and I hated it . " You 'd like to go to Ireland , would n't you , pet ? " " Not particularly . " " Oh , really , darling ? All that green , the fresh springy turf , the music of her speech , the horse fairs , the Abbey Theatre , witty conversation with A. E. and Synge ? " " They 're dead . " " Well , with other witty Irish . And would n't you like to see that old nurse of yours again  --  Flora ? " " Norah . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inIreland . And we both want you to come  --  a sort of family trip . " " Family ? " " Well , a sort of honeymoon a trois . " " You mean you 're thinking of marrying Brian ? " " Well , rather , darling . You know , I 've mourned dear Beau for nearly two years , and now I feel I 've arrived at the time in life when I need another Beau . " " Brian is n't in the least like Beau and you know it . " " Well , darling , " she said uncomfortably , " I need someone to look after me , and of course Brian needs looking after , too . He 's so shy . " " Ile 's about as shy as Jack the Ripper . " " What do you mean , dear ? " she asked tensely . " Just what I said . " " Patrick , darling , you do n't dislike Brian , do you ? " " No , I do n't dislike him ; I detest him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so afraid . . . You what ? " " I said I hate him . He 's a cheap phony with the morals of a goat and the worst case of hot pants in New York . . . " " Why , you . . . " " IIe 's laid everything but the Atlantic Cable and he 'll go right on doing it . Ile 's been mooching off you for months now and you do n't even realize that he 's not writing a word of your silly old book . " " Now sec here , young ... " " And it would be just like you to get tied up to some he-whore with the roving eye who 's at least ten years younger than you are and who 's interested in you for just two things  --  one of which is money . " " You . . . you vile-minded little imp of Satan ! How dare you speak about a keen intellect like Brian that way , you . . . " " And what 's more , he 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get out of my room , you Judas ! Get out , get out , get out ! " " I 'm going , do n't worry . " " And never set foot in it again . In fact , I never want to see you or hear you or speak to you again . " A champagne glass shattered against the wall just as I slammed her door . I was so mad about her throwing the glass that I yanked the door open and yelled : " Just for that I hope you do marry him . It 'd serve you good and damned right ! " " You get out of here , you slanderous little beast ! Brian loves me ! And I 'm going to marry him the minute I can get out of this bed ! " I stamped into my room and bounced into bed . " Patrick , darling . Wake up . Wake up , clear , I need you . " I opened an eye and saw Auntie Mamc standing over me . " Go away , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me again . " " Darling , this is serious . Agnes . . . Brian . . . they 've never shown up . " " Wh-what time is it , anyway ? " I asked , squinting in the lamplight . " It 's nearly six o'clock in the morning . " " Well , for God 's sake , it 's New Year 's Eve . Of course they 're not home . " " But , Patrick , dear . They never even went to Lindsay 's party . I was so worried I called Mary Lord Bishop  --  got her out of bed and everything  --  and she said she had n't laid eyes on them . Oh , darling , I 'm so worried . It 's that car . I knew it was a mistake to give it to him . He drives like a demon . " All of a sudden I knew what had happened . " Thank God Agnes is with him . Brian 's so quixotic , but Agnes is a good , sensible girl . Oh , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now get up and help me . " Auntie Mame started calling all the hospitals in New York , gettingmore and more frantic with each call , while I sat morosely and tried to keep awake . Then she called Lindsay Woolsey , MaryLord Bishop  --  again -- and most of the people she knew . By eight in the morning , all of medical and literary New York had been aroused by Auntie Maine . She was at the end of her rope at nine o'clock when the doorbell rang . Gathering her bed sacquc around her , she fluttered down the stairs and opened the door . There was a moment 's silence , then I heard her scream , " Oh , my God ! " I raced down the stairs to the hall where she was standing with a yellow telegram in her hand . I took it from her and read : ' 1 ' 11E FIRE WI ' 1'IIIN ME WAS TOO STRONG STOP BRIAN AND I HAVE ELOPED STOP GIVE YOUR UNDERSTANDING YOUR FORGIVENESSAND YOUR BLESSING TO YOURLOVINGAGNES GOOCHSilently Auntie Mame mounted the stairs with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the manuscript of BuffaloGal . She carried it to the fireplace and dropped it on the grate . Then she removed the bed sacque which Agnes had crocheted and dropped that in , too . The blaze was terrific . Shiveringslightly , she got into her bed and motioned me to the slipperchair beside it . She opened the last bottle of champagne , poured two glasses , and handed me one. " happy New Year , darling , " she said . AUNTIE MAMEon a Mission of MercyThe little spinster in the Digest also had something of a reputation as a midwife . Well , not really a midwife , but she 'd done such a splendid job of raising this foundling that other young mothers came to her  --  mind you , a woman who 'd never even been married  --  for advice on having babies and caring for them . And she was never too busy , the article says , to drop everything and pitch right in . I , for one , do n't think that 's quite fair . In the first place , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Auntie Mame first got her hands on me . If I 'd been any younger , who knows what might not have happened . But Auntie Mame was perfectly willing to interrupt her own life and plow right into somebody else 's , and although she 'd never had a baby and had never been around any babies and did n't even like babies , she felt more than competent to see a young girl through maternity. 122I thought I 'd heard the last of the unfortunate Brian O'Bannion and the even more unfortunate Agnes Gooch , but I had n't . A year and a half later my life and my school career were invaded by Agnes in person and Brian at least by proxy . It was my last term at St. Boniface Academy in Apathy , Massachusetts , and I was counting the clays until commencement would set me free from that somber institution . But one cool afternoon in spring we were marching  --  we never walked at St. B 's , we marched  --  from pavers to the playing field when I heard a hissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared . Everyone else turned and stared , too . It was Ito . His hand flicked out and shoved one of Auntie Mame 's big blue envelopes into mine and then he disappeared again into t he protective coloration of the forsythia . When we got to the locker room I darted into the can , slammed the door , and tore open the envelope . " Darling , darling boyCome at once ! I need you . I 'll be at Ye Olde Greene Shutters Sweete Shoppe , heavily disguised . Hurry ! Auntie Mame " I waited until I heard the rest of the class clatter out to the track field , then I raced out of the building , scaled the wall , and made for the tea room via the back alleys of the town . Ye Olde Greene Shutters was the gathering place for the gentlewomenof Apathy , who met there every afternoon to gobble down barrels of tea and butterscotch sauce . It was packed when I got there but I had no trouble spotting Auntie Mame . She was seated in a dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat with heavy veiling , dark glasses , and a black broadtail cape . If she 'd been naked she could n't have been more conspicuous among the dowdy silk prints and amber beads around her . I went to her table . " Auntie Mame ... " " Oh , my little love , " she whispered huskily , " you came straight to me with a devotion that penetrates all disguises . Could n't you have got here earlier ? " 123 " What 's the matter , Auntie Mame ? " I asked . " What are you doingin Apathy , and why are you disguised ? " " I 'm on a mission of mercy , child , and I need your strong young arm , your agile young brain to help me . " " You oughtn'ta be away from the ' cademy , sonny , " the waitresssaid to me , " but what 'll it be ? " " A cheeseburger and a chocolate malted , " I said . " He 'll have no such thing , " Auntie Mame said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After a steady diet of watery stews and saltpeter soups at St. Boniface , I was kind of miffed , but too curious to argue . " What is it , Auntie Mame ? " I asked . " What 's happened ? " She took off her dark glasses and gave me a blazing look . " It 's Agnes Gooch . Ah , what you 've done to that poor innocent virgin ! " " What I 've done ? I have n't seen old fonrcycs since ... " " Oh , not you in particular , " Auntie Maine said irritably , " you in the collective sense  --  Alen ! Most specifically that vulgar , pretentious , grade-Z poet , Brian O'Bam-ion . The beast ! Misusing poor little Agnes and then casting her out upon the mercies of a cruel and censorious world ! " " Not so fast , " I said . " Just what has happened ? " " Only the inevitable ! ' 1 ' 1-at cur took poor Agnes to California in the car I bought him , seduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , penniless , and pregnant . " Several women turned and stared . " No kidding , " I said . Then I added : " Not so loud , please . " " Kidding indeed ! Do you think I 'd leave a busy season in New York to move bag and baggage up to this cultural backwash for a joke ? Like a wounded animal poor Agnes came to me . I was the only port in a storm . Naturally she could n't turn to that puritanicalfamily of hers . " My heart stood still . " Wh-what did you say about moving up here b-bag and baggage ? " Then a terrible realization dawned . " Where is Agnes now ? " 125124 " At the Old Coolidge House . " " The  --  the Old Coolidge House right here in Apathy ? " My question was totally unnecessary . Naturally Auntie Mame , choosingto do things under the cloak of secrecy , would have selected the only hotel in town which was a shrine of the New England Historical Society , and the meeting place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rotary Club , Watch and Ward Society , and the Board of the St. Boniface Academy . " Certainly , right here in Apathy . I 've engaged quite a comfortablesuite . I had to help poor Agnes have her baby and I had to pick a place where we were unknown . " " Do you mean , " I said steadily , " that out of forty-eight states and the District of Columbia you had to select Massachusetts ? And that out of a thousand towns in Massachusetts you had to choose the one where I am ? " " But naturally , my little love , " she said with maddening logic . " I knew you would feel it your duty to stand by poor , hunted Agnes . " " But you 've got old Agnes parked right next to the school . The hotel is the place where everybody . . . " " Of course , darling . I wanted it centrally located . That 's why I chose it  --  so you could be at hand to help me bring a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor broken blossom back to . .. " " But , Auntie Manic , I 'll get in a hell of a jam . In a few weeks I can be out of this awful dump . But they 'll find out just as sure as ... " " Nonsense ! 1 low could they possibly discover anything ? We arrivediii darkness last night . I 've even gone to the trouble of taking the suite under an assumed name . I 've engaged a Boston doctor who is the soul of discretion . It 'll only be a matter of weeks until the baby is born , I 'll settle some money on Agnes , establish her somewhere , and then "  --  she paused  --  " I thought that you and I could take a little trip  --  Europe , I think  --  for the whole summer . You 'd like that , would n't you ? " " Europe ? " I breathed . " Yes , love , Europe , " she said slyly , " but only on the one conditionthat you help me get Agnes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I was taking a fatal step , but the fleshpots of Paris after the chamber pots of St. Boniface were too strong for me . " Okay , " I said grimly . " Good ! Now let 's be off to poor Agnes . " Auntie Mame paid the check with a fifty-dollar bill . Then she drew the veil about her face and slunk out with such an air of mystery that I could feel every eye boring into our backs . Her Rolls-Royce was parked outside with all the shades drawn and Ito at the wheel . A crowd of curious onlookers had gathered to admire it and they stared after us , buzzing and scratching their heads as we drove off . Auntie Mann , lolling back and smoking behind the lowered shades , was happily unaware of the figure she was cutting . I was n't . In the first place , there had never been a Rolls or a Jap in Apathy before . In the second , St. Boniface had a spy system in the town that would have put the GPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school itself , they were doing intelligence work in town . In the distance of three blocks I spotted the English piaster , the tennis coach , and the chaplain . The chaplain even removed his hat and bowed his head as the big black car passed by with its shades down . I was so scared of being seen off campus that I did n't pay much attention to Auntie Mame 's conversation . It was mostly stuff about the spirituality of motherhood , the mysterious beauty of pregnancy , and the serenity of the waiting period . When I asked her how she knew she told me not to be impertinent and said that Agnes was a changed woman . I was naturally hesitant about going into the Old Coolidge House , but Auntie Mame was getting restive and pushed me into the front door , where I came face to face with the room clerk  --  a paid informer for St. Boniface . The first thing he did after he saw my school blazer was to ask if I had a pass to be off126campus . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ! " Auntie Mame snapped , and yanked me up the stairs so fast that he could n't ask to sec it . Agnes let us into the suite . herself and then locked the door . She was changed , but 1 failed to see any mysterious beauty in her condition . First of all , she was enormous . Then , she 'd never quite gotten oycr the brief fling at high style she 'd enjoyed on the fateful New Ycai 's Eve when she eloped with Brian . Now she 'd mixed the ateliers of Paris with the crochet hook of Kew Gardens so Ihat she looked like a cross between a demimondaine and a string laundry bag . She 'd made her maternity wardrobe herself . Agnes had taken to putting on a lot of make-up , too , and she did it very badly . Seeing her groping around without her prim spectacles , garishly dressed and whorishly painted , she looked less like the mysterious beauty Auntie Mame had promised and more like a fallen woman who was paying the customary price for lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or serenity . Always one to feel sorry for herself when she had little cause to do so , Agnes now had a damned good reason and she overflowed with tears of self-pity . She threw her arms around me and wept bitterly , the overload of mascara running in muddy rivulets down her rouged checks . I Icr entire vocabulary seemed to be made up of such terms as Silly Girl , Fool , Wanton , and Woman Wronged . Well , I ca n't quite put my finger on it , but Agnes was a mess . While Agnes vilified herself , Auntie Mame removed some of her disguise , fluffed her hair , settled down on the Empire sofa in the pallor , and rang downstairs for refreshments  --  eggnog for Agnes , tea for me , and cognac for herself . " Blow your nose now , Agnes , " Auntie Manic said crisply , " and do stop sniffling . You know it upsets Inc . Well , my little love , you see how easy all this is going to be . ! few we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all t he world to see . " At this Agnes burst into a perfect torrent of tears . " Do stop that , Agnes ! " Auntie Manic said . " It ca n't be good for you or127the baby . You 'll dehydrate yourself or something . As I was saying , " she continued to me , " here we are  --  a mysterious widow , her sister-in-law , and a servant , all registered at the Old Coolidge House until time for the , urn , accouchement . Even if the townsfolkshould notice us  --  and that 's highly improbable  --  there 's nothing to wonder about . We 're absolutely self-contained here . We have our meals sent up . The doctor drives up from Boston once a week . I have Ito to take messages to you and to drive us out for little airings . Agnes can take her walk  --  four full miles a day  --  every evening after dark . We have nothing to do but wait until her , uh , time . You see , with a little money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as easily as that . " " Well , gee , that 's just swell , " I said . " But could n't you have done all this just as well in a hotel suite in , say , Cleveland , or Milwaukee , or Dallas  --  far more interesting cities , and places where I 'm not . " " Ah , but you see I do need you , my little love . " " But why , if you 're all this self-contained ? What can I possibly do but get myself into a mess at school ? " " You can do four things , " Auntie Maine said darkly . " What . . . are . . . they ? " I asked . I did n't like her tone . " First of all , I shall need you to run errands . There are ever so many things I 'll need and I assume there are things an expectant mother might need , too . You know this town . I do n't . What 's more , it would be dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dangerous for you to be seen ? " I said . " If you went to St. Boniface Academy and got a demerit every time you scratched your ass , you 'd know how dangerous it is to be seen in ... " " Patrick ! Your language ! Think of the prenatal influence ! Well , that 's the first thing . The second thing is shopping for me in Boston . The food here is deplorable  --  good for Agnes , of course , but awful for me . Ito can never be trusted in a strange city , so tomorrowyou can take the car and drive into S. S. Pierce and get me a case of ... " " I ca n't drive your car . I do n't even have a license . " 128 " But of course you can drive . I taught you myself . And if you drive carefully  --  as I certainly hope you would  --  nobody will even ask to see your license . I 've never had one myself , and look at me . " " Auntie Maine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out so fast . . . " " Of course you want to graduate . Education 's a wonderful thing . Now , Number Three : I 'll need you to make up a fourth at ! midge . I'ni teaching Culbertson to Agnes . It does her good . ( : 1V ( s her sonict ling to think about . " " Something to think about ? " Agnes moaned . " Be still , Agnes . Yes . And a very apt little pupil she is , too . Ito plays Sims  --  and not too badly if he 'd only stop giggling , and concentrate . To fill a table , I shall need you . " She fitted a cigarette into her holder and drank delicately of her cognac . " But the most important service you can render . . . " She paused . " Wh-what 's that ? " I asked suspiciously. " ' ! ' hc most important duty I have in mind for you is to walk goes . " ' Po what ? " " Walk Agnes . Four good miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's getting much too heavy . Agnes , poor silly , says that her feet hurt too much , but I say ... " " Your feet would hurt too , if you 'd walked all the way from Cannel , California , to ... " Agnes burst into tears and fled clumsily to her bedroom . " Now see what you 've done to her ! " Auntie Mame snapped . " Oh , you 're all alike ! Poor little Agnes ! Walked all the way from California alone , and here you refuse to take her for a stroll in the evening . " I said , " Do n't you realize that this is just about the craziest thing you 've ever tried to do ? You 've got all the money in the world . You could take Agnes to any nursing home and wait there with doctors and nurses to see that everything goes right . But do you do anything sensible ? No ! You drag her up to this god-129forsaken hole right under the noses of the school and Dwight Babcock junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , yet you expect me to break out of that prison and wait on you hand and foot : trips to Boston for pate and truffles ; a fourth at bridge ; errands ; and then walking poor Agnes like a poodle every ... " " Paris , " Auntie Mame said . " Paris , Rome , London , Vienna , Cannes , Nice , Monte Carlo , Venice ... " I stopped my tirade . " B-but Auntie Mame , how can I get away from school ? I 'm watched like a ... " " Nonsense , my little love , " she said airily , polishing off her drink . " Anybody can get out if he really wants to . Why , I hardly ever spent a night in the dormitory at Miss Rushaway 's , and at Smith I was out till all hours .

" " I 've thought of that , too , Patrick . You see that coiled-up rope with the knots tied in it ? No , over there by the window . Well , I discovered that that is the system of fire escape used in this provincialhostelry . You have only to whistle at my window and I 'll lower it for you so you can climb up . When you 're ready to leave ... " " But it 's three stories ! " " Wonderful for the arms and shoulders , darling . " " I 've got so many demerits already that the corridor master is ... " " Antwerp , Brussels , Ostend , Athens . . . " " Auntie Mame , I . .. " " Shall we say tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here , I 'll let down the rope for you . " She tripped daintily to the window . I perched gingerly on the sill and looked down . " By the way , " I said , " what names are you using here , in case I have to get in touch with you ? " " Oh , that , " she said . " I 'm glad you asked . For myself , I did a very clever thing . I cut my name from Burnside to Burns and used my maiden name as a first name . So I 'm Mrs. Dennis Burns . " " And what 's Agnes ? " " Agnes ? Oh . Oh , yes darling . Well , when I registered I just could n't think of a name for her , so I wrote down the first thing that came to mind . " " What was that ? " " It was Mrs. Patrick Dennis . " It took me a surprisingly short time to reach the ground . My next three weeks were hell . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from it . And getting away from St. Boniface was no cinch , either . Not only were there roll calls all day and bed checks all night , but there was a complex faculty spy ring and also something called the Student Patrol  --  a quasiofficialbody composed of the most unpopular boys at school , always eager to report the slightest infraction . A year at St. Bonifacecould prepare anyone for life in a police state . Junior Babcock was always around , too . We 'd been roommatesever since my first day at St. B 's , not because we liked one another , but because his father , my trustee , wanted to keep tabs on mc . I lc could n't have chosen a better informer than his own son . Junior was a toady and a bully and a prig ; a coward and a tattletale and a cheat . Ile was prone to periodic sieges of conjunctivitis and to eternal acne . He smelled like a sour washclothand lie snored . But one thing I 've got to say for old Junior is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night a good deal easier . My services to Auntie Mame worked themselves into somethingof a routine . I used to duck out every afternoon at three after getting another guy to answer for me at roll call on the track field . Then I 'd go down to the hotel , climb the rope at Auntie Mame 's suite , and run whatever errands she had . Twice a week I 'd drive into Boston to do her heavy shopping . The car attracted about as much attention as a steam calliope , but I 'd gone to the precaution of getting myself a disguise  --  a tweed jacket , a porkpiehat , and a jazzbo tie from Filene 's basement  --  so at least I would n't be spotted a mile away in the St. Boniface cap , blazer , and necktie . I added a pair of dark glasses , too . Auntie Mame said I looked too tatty for words and could n't I have gone to J. Press and bought something smart ? But I managed to walk right past the headmaster 's wife without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy it was to get out at night . There was a tree outside nay window and all I had to do was wait for Junior 's asthmatic snore , get my " civilian " clothes from their hiding place , arrange a pillow to look like me in bed , and skedaddle . The only thing that made me feel kind of bad was Mr. Pugh . He was master for our corridor and he was the only man at St. B 's who gave even a faint impression of liking kids or teaching . He was a long , lanky , old-maidish man of about forty with an Adam 's apple as big as a duck egg and a passion for poetry and music and art and nature and children . Well , I guess I have n't made him sound very attractive , but he was a hell of a nice guy in a prim sort of way . He was kind and understanding and gentle and quiet and he never gave us demerits except when he absolutelyhad to . I knew that if they caught me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , family loyalty  --  and a trip to Europe  --  came first . Well , at night I 'd get down to the Old Coolidge House around ten and whistle under the window . That was the signal for Agnes to put on her hiking shoes and take her walk . Agnes was never the best company in the world , even when she just talked about132her mother 's arthritis and her sister Edna and Kew Gardens and the insurance company . Now she could only discuss how she 'd been wronged , how she was branded with the scarlet A , how the innocent little soul beneath her heart  --  Agnes ' term  --  would bear the bar sinister , how Brian O'Bannion was no gentleman  --  somethingof an understatement , 1 thought  --  and how her feet hurt . Once or twice I had to drag poor old Agnes into the bushes when I saw masters from the school en route to the local whorehouse or the bar of the hotel , but by and large our walks were noteworthyonly for their boredom . Once back at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd all play bridge  --  or try to play bridge while Agnes whimpered and Ito giggled and counted much too heavily on the psychic bid . Auntie Mame also kept a well-stocked bar within easy reach of the bridge table  --  so festive , she said  --  although she was the only one who drank anything . I 'd be dismissed about two in the morning to let myself down the rope , trudge back to school , scale the wall , climb the tree , and get to bed . As all of St. Boniface Academy rose at six for cold showers and calisthenics , I was existing on a maximum of three hours ' sleep a night . More than once I dozed off in classes and got ten demerits and a lecture about Playing the Game . But you can get used to anything , and visions of being out of St. B 's forever and spending the summer in Europe were like Benzedrine to inc . After a couple of weeks of being away from school more than I was in it , with nothing worse happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how easy it all was and to regret not having lived a richer , fuller life during my years at St. B 's . My luck had held out so well that I even started getting a little careless . On the night I bid and made a grand slam , doubled , redoubled , and vulnerable , it was after four when I got back to school . I was so clog-tired that I did n't even bother to hide my disguise under the mattress , and when I woke up at the six o'clock bell , what should I see but Junior Babcock , in his dirty133old flannelette pajamas , squinting down incredulously at my tweed jacket and my jazzbo tie . " Wh-where 'd you get those ? " he asked . " Where did I get what ? " I asked . " Those clothes . It 's fifty demerits for being improperly dressed . You ought a know that ... " With a flick of the hand , I swept Junior 's glasses off the night table and tossed them under the bed . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man , " I said . " You 're seeing things . " By the time he 'd found his glasses , my disguise was back under the mattress and my St. Boniface blazer was in its place . " Gee , Junior , " I said , once his pale eyes were focused from behind the thick lenses , " I 'm kind of worried about you . You 're having visions . Maybe you ought to stop by the infirmary and let the doc look you over . " Junior was n't very bright , but on the other hand , he was no fool . He gave me kind of a fishy look and went off to his cold shower . I saw then that I 'd have to be a little more cant ions . But that night I should have called it quits . It was a beautiful spring evening  --  all stars and a moon as bright as day and the crickets going hell for leather in the meadows . It was too beautifula night to be wasting on a girl like Agnes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was duty . I was trudging grimly up the road , with Agnes holding my arm and waddling along in a garish cerise maternity dress trimmed with a dusty cluster of artificial calla lilies when I heard the unmistakable roar of the headmaster 's car . Everybody in Apathy could recognize the Nashcan a mile away . Dr. Cheevey , the headmaster at St. B 's , had bought the Nash in 1926 , and he was much too tight to turn it in on a new car or even to invest in a little professional consultation . Instead , he let us work off demerits by washing the car and keeping its motor in tune , so that after ten years of student care , the Nash sounded more like a threshing machine than a car . Agnes and I were just coming to a bend in the road when I134heard the Nashcan coming , and from the racket it was making , it was coming pretty fast . " Sorry , Agnes , " I said , " but we 've got to get out of sight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallantlydown into the ditch . Then I prepared to take the Ieap myself , just as the headmaster 's car was rounding the bend . But somehow T lost my footing and fell headlong clown the embankment. 1 landed on something soft , and there was an awful sound of " O00000f ! " just as the Nashcan roared past . " Agnes ! " I said , terrified . " Are you all right ? I lave I hurt you ? " " You have n't hurt me at all , Patrick , " she whined . " I 'm over here by the culvert , and goodness , I 've been hurt so much that it would n't matter if I lived or died . That Brian , luring me away and ... " " Patrick ! " a voice gasped . " Patrick Dennis ! " I looked beneath me on the ground , and there was Mr. Pugh . " Mister Pugh ! " I gasped . Then I added inanely , " What are you doing here ? " He was in such a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Patrick , boy , there 's a swamp nearby where a certain kind of night blooming . . . " Then he stopped . " And what , " he said , " arc you doing here ? " I halfway hoped to bluff it out . What with knocking the wind out of him , scattering his binoculars , his bird log , his Guide to the Wildflowers of New England , his flashlight , and his thermos of cocoa , and also having caught him where he should n't have been , I thought t had a fifty-fifty chance . " Gee , Mr. Pugh , " I began , " it was such a lovely night and I 'm so fond of birds that I hoped maybe I could sec a Baltimore oriole , or . . . " " Oh , Patrick , do help me . I 'm so frightened , " Agnes whimpered . Mr. Pugh shot Agnes a look , standing there in the bright moonlight twice as big as life . Then he looked coldly at me . " And who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's , uh , just Agnes . Yes , urn , she 's my aunt 's Alice B. Toklas and I was just . . . " " I , " Agnes said clearly , " am Mrs. Patrick Dennis . " Well , I would n't want to relive that night again if you gave me Europe . Mr. Pugh scrambled out of the ditch and walked Agnes and me back to the hotel in jig time . Agnes kept protesting that she was supposed to walk four miles with me and that we had n't done more than one and a half . I kept protesting that things were n't what they seemed and I pleaded with Agnes to come off it and admit who she really was . But Agnes had been too well coached by Auntie Mame , and she also would n't have given her own name away for anything . " My name is Mrs. PatrickDennis , " she kept saying doggedly . " She is n't , Mr. Pugh , " I said . " That is n't her name at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never going to be . I 'm not married to anybody . I just happened to ... " He gave me a devastating look as Agnes skittered into the hotel and then he took me firmly by the arm and led me back to school . I spent most of the rest of the night in his room trying to make him believe me . I 'll admit that the true story , told word for word , was n't a very plausible one , but by five in the morning , if Mr. Pugh had n't entirely revised his opinion that I was a no-good despoiler of innocent virgins , he at least had given up trying to shake my testimony . He gave me some cocoa from his thermos , said he would n't say anything about it yet , and saw me to my room . I felt like a zombie in school the next day , but at three I was raring to get into town and have a little council of war with Auntie Mame . The last class of the day was English Poetry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell had just rung , releasing us to the playing fields of St. Boniface , when Mr. Pugh asked me to stay after class . " Now , young man , " Mr. Pugh said , " you and I are going into town to see this mysterious relative of yours , as well as the unforina red ribbon , and she was on the floor doing something which looked obscene but was really only an exercise to firm the scat and thighs . There was a half-finished bottle of champagne at her side and the room was littered with yellow-backed French novels , a lot of fashion magazines , and six volumes of Gibbon . But even an aunt who looked " fast " was better than none at the moment . " Auntie Mame , " I said , " this is ... " " How dare you come to my room , sir ? " Auntie Mame said coldly , staring straight through me . " I must ask you to leave at once or I 'll be forced to call the management . " Mr. Pugh spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam , that this young man is not your nephew ? " " I never saw him before in my life , " she said . " Auntie Mame , " I said desperately , " you 've got- to explain to Mr. Pugh about Agnes . I 'll get kicked out of school . I Ic knows . He ... " " Please to leave immediately , young man . You 're obviously suffering under the delusion that we have met before . Au conztraire , I am a lone widow , residing here with my sister-in-law and a body servant . " Once Auntie Mane got her teeth into a part she played it to the hilt . " Mr. Pugh , " I said , " she is my Aunt Mame . She 's Mrs. BeauregardBurnside . Really she is . " " This poor lad is desperately in need of psychiatric help , " Auntie Mame said , getting up off the floor and commanding as much dignity as possible under the circumstances . " I am Mrs. Dennis Burns and my first name is Arabella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been listening at the door , burst into the room , sopping with tears . " It 's true , Mrs. Burnside . Patrickhas been discovered . Now all the world will know me as a wanton woman . " Auntie Manie more or less had to give up . She told Mr. Pugh to sit down , poured him a glass of champagne , and retired to slip into a demure black sheer . In about an hour , with only a few embellishments , Auntie Mame gave him the whole story , while136 tunate young woman who may or may not be your wife and the mother of your child . " " But , Mr. Pugh . . . " I began desperately . " Come , " lie said firmly , Auntie Manic was a very dynamic woman . Everybody said so . She could be charm itself , and there was almost no occasion to which she felt unable to rise . But sl-c did like to have a little prcpaiat ion and time to throw herself wholeheartedly into what- ever role she was planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her of what was coming . On the way down the road I even said , " Suppose I stop in here at the hash wagon and call my aunt , Mr. Pugh . Shc can order tea or something for us . " " That wo n't be necessary , Patrick . Our interview will be a very short one . I have papers to mark this afternoon , and you should n't be eating between meals . " I hoped ardently that Auntie Mame and Agnes would be out motoring , but the big car was parked in front of the Old Coolidge IIouse . Auntie Mame 's windows were open and I could hear her portable gramophone playing more advanced music by Paul Ilindemith . " I 'm not allowed into the hotel without a pass , Mr. Pugh , " I said desperately . " My aunt 's in rooms 3-A-B-C and D. I 'll go up the rope and . . . " " Nonsense , Patrick . You can go anywhere as long as you 're accompanied by a master . Come . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mame had wearied of Hindemith 's " Symphonic Metamorphosis " and was playing Bessie Smith 's " Empty Bed Blues . " I tapped timidly at the door . " Yes ! " she called . I opened it and stepped in . " Darling . . . " she called . Then , seeing Mr. Pugh , the words died . Auntie Mame was not exactly prepared to play the role of my respectable guardian . She was wearing shorts , a halter , and a lot of Lydia van Rensselaer Essence of Youth . Her hair was tied up 138Agnes sobbed drearily into a crumpled hankie and kept moaning about her downfall . Almost against his will and quite against his better judgment , poor old Mr. Pugh was dragged into the conspiracy just to help me keep out of trouble if I was ever discovered . He took to tiptoeinginto my room after bed check every night and escaping with me out of the window while Junior snored . Then he'd. walk Agnes with me , go back to the hotel and have a drink  --  or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bridge . Then we 'd sneak back to school . He was n't supposed to be out at night either . It even got to be quite a lot of fun with Mr. Pugh along . I-Ic recited poetry to Agnes , who was kind of a pushover for poets , and cheered her up somewhat by telling her how Leonardo da Vinci and Alexander Hamilton and Lucrezia Borgia and severalother famous people had all been illegitimate . My classwork was beginning to suffer from lack of sleep and study , and one night Mr. Pugh even insisted on taking Agnes out alone and making me stay in Auntie Mame 's parlor to bone up for a history exam . I did n't get much work done . Auntie Mame had sent me to Boston that afternoon to buy a lot of new Bartok records , and she insisted on playing them at full volume . " Ali , my little love , " she said , pouring herself a drink , " a quiet evening at home , a deux , and a chance to have a little chat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , music therapy is important to the expectant mother , if only for the strong prenatal influences , but I do get a bit weary of Glazunov and Mcycrbeer  --  pretty as they are . " " Yes , Auntie Maine , " I said . I yawned and started in again on Prime Minister Disraeli and Omen Victoria . " And speaking of pretty , darling , did n't you notice how nice Agnes looked tonight ? " " Urn , " I said . 1 had n't , but I had seen that she was wearing a kind of plain dark-blue maternity dress instead of one of her girlgone-wrongoutfits . She also had n't seemed quite so painted . I turned to Disraeli. 139 " I also made Agnes up tonight , " Auntie Manic twittcrcd , turning up the phonograph and running her fingers through - my hair . " I said , Agnes , cosmetics are to enhance , not to detract . ' Would you like to hear some Bloch , my little love ? " " No , thank you . " Disraeli and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal with Napoleon and Wellington and Antony and Cleopatra . " You know , I think that our Agnes rather likes Mr. Pugh , and that Mr. Pugh rather likes our Agnes . " " Um-hm , " I said , trying fruitlessly to concentrate . The conversation ended as we heard Agnes clumping heavily up the stairs . She was laughing for the first time since she 'd been in Apathy . " Oh , Mr. Pugh , " she said , " nobody has ever recited Gray 's Allergy and made it sound so beauty-ful . " St. Boniface Academy was pretty old , as American schools went , and they were great ones for tradition . They used quite a lot of British terms such as Old Boy , New Boy , Proctor , Digs , Tuck Shop , Playing Field , Master , Refectory , Greensward , and Common Room . There were traditional rites , too , like Ninth Class Pillow Fight , New Boys ' Indoctrination , Court of Confession , and Demerit Day  --  all of which were mislabeled as festivitiesand all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more tiresome festivals was Father and Son Day , a fairly new tradition that was celebrated at the beginning of May . It was the occasion for fathers who were Old Boys to stretch their St. B. blazers over their paunches and patronize fathers who had n't gone to St. B. and were consequently better dressed and better educated , albeit declasse . Oh , it was a lark , Father and Son Day ! There was a Maypole , and gymnastic feats , and relay races , and morris dancing by six unfortunate little boys from the lower school , and a medley of rousing St. B. songs sung by the fathers who were Old Boys while the fathers who were n't stood sheepishly around looking as though they 'd sell their souls for a drink . Well , Father and Son Day made me almost grateful to be
