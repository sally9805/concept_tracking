In a world that was getting more comlicated every day , industrious inventors were doing their best to simplify things here &; there . Items : <P> Dayton , the U.S. Air Forces Air Materiel Command produced a parachute with a built-in brain , which automatically goes into action even if an airman is inured bailing out of his plane or blacks out at high altitude . Designed for high-flying fighters and bombers , the release is tripped by a timer ( to be set before take-off at from one to 26 seconds ) , includes an aneroid barometer which opens the chute above 5,000 ft. no matter what happens . <P> In Los Angeles , the National Bureau o Standards ' Institute for Numerical Analysis started operating a new electronic calculator which in a mere four hours can solve 150 simultaneous algebraic equations nvolving 4,000,000 arithmetic operations . It can also perform 1,000,000 additions a minute and even make a stab at translating foreign languages ( Present vocaulary : 200 words ) . If SWAC ( for Standards Western Automatic Computer ) had been around during World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been saved the work ot more than a year compiling rocket-nring tables ; SWAC , which needs no sleep , has no love problems , could have done the whole job in a month . <P> In Chicago , the Argonne National Laboratory perfected a new radiation-detector which is smaller than a cigarette , weighs only a quarter of an ounce , can be worn on clothing like a fountain pen . <P> In Bar Harbor , Me. , geneticists at the Roscoe B. Jackson Memorial Laboratory finally succeeded in raising a pair of Siamese cats with orange " points " ( i.e. , ears feet and tails ) , straw-colored bodies and clear blue eyes .
