" If you lived in Phoenix and you wanted to go to an art museum with a broad coverage of art , " Actor-Collector Vincent Price once pointed out , " you 'd have to go as far west as Los Angeles , as far south as Mexico City , as far east as Denver and as far north as Moose Jaw , Saskatchewan . " Last week Phoenix proudly opened its brand-new , $500,000 Museum of Art , housing a collection of art valued at $2,600,000 in a handsome , low-lying , stuccoed masonry , glass and aluminum structure on North Central Avenue , designed by Architect Alden Dow .
