Baseball , as played on the manicured , moneyed diamonds of the major leagues , is not generally considered a dangerous sport . But on the seedy ball fields of the bush leagues , the hazards of the game have always been considerable . Bush-leaguers get poisoned by carbon monoxide in the line of duty ( while riding ancient buses between towns ) , break ribs and ankles with alarming frequency in outfield potholes , sometimes have to cadge money for food . Nowadays a fan might even get up one morning and find that his team has vanished altogether . Said Sam Bray , insurance salesman and owner of Tennessee 's Kingsport Cherokees : " Every year now a crowd of minor leagues folds up . But this is the worst year in history . " <P> And Then There Were Four . Owner Bray , a sad , gentle man , knows what he is talking about . In 1949 there were 59 recognized minor leagues and today there are only 35 ; most of the 250-odd baseball clubs playing in them are in financial trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans . This year several teams already have folded . By next season five of the leagues now operating will probably be gone . <P> Sam Bray 's Cherokees are in an economic position to last out the season , but the Class C Mountain States League , to which they belong , is bordering on collapse . At a meeting last week the poverty-stricken Lexington Colts were voted out of the league . That left just four teams competing of the eight that began the season . <P> To keep the Cherokees on the base paths , Bray has combined pinch-penny management with showmanship . On the road , his players are allowed only $2.50 a day for meals , must sleep two to a bed ( one gets the mattress and floor , one the boxsprings and bedstead ) . But to attract customers , Sam has given away $1,000 bills at his park , once piled $1,200 in small change on home plate and let a fan take home as much of it as he could carry . <P> A month ago , disgusted because his team was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would give away the club and $3,000 to anybody who would keep the Cherokees in Kingsport . Sam was halfjoking , but when the Associated Press sent the story around the country , Bray got 100 phone calls and 160 letters-not a single offer from Kingsport , though . But the publicity did wonders . Attendance soared ( Sam needs 500 cash customers at every home game to break even ) , and his ballplayers got so mad at the insult that within a week the Cherokees ran up an eight-game winning streak . Soon they were in third place . Last week , after Lexington 's departure , they were back in the cellar . Said Bray : " Every time we get on top of somebody , they quit . " Language Lesson . Nevertheless Bray is delighted with his rejuvenated team . <P> Two of the Cherokees are oldtimers , Leo ( " Muscles " ) Shoals , 38 , and Nap Reyes , 35 , the wartime N.Y . Giant who made headlines by jumping to the Mexican League in 1946 . The other 14 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Cubans who speak almost no English . The high-spirited Cubans used to heckle the league umpires vigorously in Spanish . But the umpires got wise , got a list of Spanish cuss words and , thus armed , one day sent all the Cubans to the showers .
