Andrew Sakacs , 43 , had a pleasant Saturday outing a fortnight ago with his son and little grandson . He tramped through woods in sparsely settled Lockwood Valley in California 's Ventura County , got in some target practice . Back in El Rio and getting undressed , he noticed a red spot , like a fleabite , on the inner side of his right ankle , but thought nothing of it . Feeling fit on Monday , Sakacs , a retired Navy chief petty officer , put in a full day 's work as a mechanic on a water research project at the Port Hueneme naval base . That night he had chills and fever and diarrhea , so he took the following day off and went to see an osteopath . He got a shot of penicillin , quinine for a suspected recurrence of malaria , and aspirin for the aches and pains-which were worst in his right groin . There was a slight lump there , too . Two days later , with Sakacs ' symptoms getting worse , he was taken to Corona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander Lay M. Fox , 31 , an internist from Baltimore , got the same story of chills and fever , noted a pustule on the right ankle . In Sakacs ' right groin he found two groups of enlarged lymph nodes , each about one inch by two inches . Like 99.9% of U.S. physicians , young Dr. Fox had never seen a case like it . But on the strength of the fleabite and the buboes , he made a quick diagnosis : bubonic plague . <P> Sakacs was started on a heroic regimen of four antibiotics plus sulfa drugs . Bubonic plague itself is not highly contagious . But there was a danger that the disease might spread to his lungs-where it would become the dangerously infectious form known as pneumonic plague , or " Black Death . " * Two dozen people who had come in contact with him got sulfa and an antibiotic as a preventive . <P> California 's elaborate machinery for confirming a case of bubonic plague began to grind . The plague bacillus lives in fleas , which in turn infest Western ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the rodents . In Lockwood Valley , disease detectives found the shriveled carcasses of rabbits and ground squirrels by the score . More significant , they found fleas on the ground because their animal hosts had died . <P> Last week Andrew Sakacs died . By this time there was no doubt as to what killed him , or how he got his fatal infection . His was the first case of plague in southern California since 1936 . But millions of flea-infested rodents constitute an ever-filled reservoir of the disease throughout the West and Southwest . The hopeful word from Lockwood Valley was that with the rodents already dead , the epizootic had burned itself out . Sakacs was a casualty only by rare and unhappy chance . <P> * In the great cycle of epidemics which swept across Europe in the 14th century , up to 25 million people are estimated to have died of plague . In some areas two-thirds or three-fourths of the population died .                    @
