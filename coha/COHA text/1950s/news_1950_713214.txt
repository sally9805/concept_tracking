SCHAUMBURG.LIONEL pg . 160 Letters STOCKHOLM APPEAL TO THE EDITOR : I am impressed by Telford Taylor 's reasonable consideration and criticism of the Stockholm Appeal in his article , " . Not the A-Bomb Alone but All Armaments " ( Aug. 27 ) . Finding it to be unfortunate that official criticism of the appeal has been based chiefly on the fact of Communist support ? a ground of criticism that bears no relation to the virtue or defect of the appeal itself ? he indicates its defect as lying in its failure to include not only all weapons of mass destruction but the reduction of all armaments . Although I was a member of the resolutions committee of the Stockholm Conference that drafted the appeal , I am in entire agreement with this criticism . Most of the discussion of this measure by the resolutions committee was directed toward achieving such conciseness and brevity in the appeal as would meet with prompt and unquestioned response by the millions to whom it was proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include a demand for the reduction of all armaments . As Mr. Taylor implies , criticism of the Stockholm Appeal on the ground that it has-Communist backing is on a completely false basis . I am reminded of having heard the Einstein theory criticized in 1922 by an educated and otherwise seemingly intelligent man on the ground that Einstein was a German Jew . Atom bombs , rocket bombs , block-busters  --  all are instruments of mass destruction . It is my opinion that all should be banned , even as weapons of immediate and unquestioned self-defense . ROCKWELL KENT . Ausabie Forks . N. Y. ( Mr. Taylor comments : " Rockwell Kent 's agreement that atomic weapons can not be singled out from other weapons of modern warfare would be more reassuring were it not for the implication in his letter that this is the only respect in which the ' Stockholm Peace Appeal ' is deficient . " On the contrary , and as stated in my article , any program of international disarmament must be based on a practical and workable program of enforcement by means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' strict international control ' but it says not a word about how this control is to be effected . And one must eye this mention of international control with deep ' suspicion of the sincerity of the Communist sponsors of the Appeal , in the light of the consistent and stubborn Russian . opposition to all proposals for effective international inspection of atomic facilities . " I heartily agree with Mr. Kent that it is an unsound dialectic to denounce a program or theory  --  whether it be atomic disarmament or relativity  --  solely on the basis of its authorship . More important at the moment , it is also bad diplomacy and self-defeating propaganda . But it by no means follows that , in gauging the purposes of the Appeal 's sponsors , we can afford to overlook their behavior as a whole ? at Lake Success , in Korea , in Eastern Europe or wherever the issue of a world free or a world in thrall is being drawn . " CUSTOMS COURTESY TO THE EDITOR : Re Gilbert Millstein 's " Human Nature : A Customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further point ought to . be made about the special service granted to student and teacher groups returning home . Particularly swift attention is often given by Port of New York customs inspectors to them to ? that they have their baggage inspected as a unit , thus saving much time . B. SARAH ALLEN . Chicago : APPEALING PICTURES TO THE EDITOR : The set of photographs of New York children playing checkers " King Row : City Style " ( Aug. 27 ) was not // Concentration ? at play and at work . // only most appealing in itself but strikingly recalled another recent set of pictures in THE Times Magazine showing city students taking exams " Grade School to Grad , " June 16 , 1950 . What impressed was that the children playing checkers seemed to have the same concentration as their elders working at their finals . E. PETIT . New York . BOMBS AND IDEAS TO THE EDITOR : I deplore Hanson W. Baldwin 's " The Basic Concept : Offense , Not Defense " ( Aug. 20 ) . It ends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive strategy , can only pave the way to eventual defeat . The problem is how to lick the enemy , and that can be done only by offensive tactics and offensive strategy . " I admire Tennessee Williams ' humane attitude in his " A Writer 's Quest for a Parnassus " ( Aug. 13 ) when he writes : " The Marshall Plan must be translated , now , and amended , ' into spirit , if the dreaded thing that the Western World is waiting for can still be averted . " The first idea is destructive , the second constructive . From the first I have feared that the American people would cast the first bomb . We can not destroy the ideas of others with bombs . Only an idea that shows better fruit can do that . Patience will win , for it is a sign of strength . JEAN OLIPHANT . Kingsville , Ont . Mr. Baldwin 's article was not a discussion of national policy but an analysis of a new technical military concept that " the defense is catching up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDITOR : Regarding Frank Romaine 's letter in your columns with reference to Sam Boal 's " Getting Hot About Keeping Cool " ( Aug. 6 ) : Heat waves and light waves are different lengths . That portion of the sun 's emanations that produces heat is the invisible infra-red rays . Any hot non-incandescent body also emits infra-red rays  --  the human body included . The heat from the sun and the heat from the human body are the same invisible , non-actinic rays , which are repelled by white clothing . Dr. S. C. SIVITZ . Lewistown , Pa . Mr. Romaine took exception to Mr. Boal 's assertion , in discussing . the theory that white clothing repels heat and black absorbs it , that " If white clothing repels heat coming from the sun , it also repels heat ' coming from the man wearing it . " Mr. Romaine argued that it is the sun 's light rays which . white repels , while the human body emanates no light rays. ? Editor . PIEHRU 'S POSITION TO THE EDITOR : As to Robert Trumbull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Aug. 20 ) : In World Wars I and II we Nehru : A portrait by V. R. Rao . came in contact , for the first time , with new and unknown people . In a natural and characteristic way , our men and women when meeting these people displayed a freedom and way of life never before witnessed . Is it not reasonable to assume that they , too , might like to live the same kind of life ? How to get it for them is a stupendous problem . To win the respect of the forward-looking leaders of India might well be a great step . Through the action of India we might regain the confidence of the Chinese . Even Russia , under such circumstances , might be impressed . F. W. SCHAUMBURG . Montclair , N. J. BIG WALLOP To THE EDITOR : The 4.2-mm mortar mentioned in W. H. Lawrence 's " Talks With Seven G. I. 's in Korea " ( Aug. 27 ) would pack a " big wallop "  --  and fire a shell about the size of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemical mortar , orig. inally developed by the Army 's Chemical Corps to fire gas and ' smoke shells . During World War II it was used to fire high-explosive as well as white phosphorous shells . It proved spectacularly valuable as highly mobile artillery in close support of infantry . And it does pack a big wallop ! I understand it has been taken over by the infantry , now . LIONEL B. CoNRATit . Pittsburgh . Mr. Conrath is right . The reference was to the 4.2-inch mortar. ? Editor . WOMAN 'S SUCCESS TO THE EDITOR : . Mildred Adams ' the Women 's Vote Has Not Done " ( Aug. 20 ) is an article of negation . Her main concern seems to be that a woman must reach the $10,000 yearly goal so she can match her husband 's pay , checks . A woman 's first concern , or I should say vocation , is her home and taking care of her children . Also being helpful in the community and giving her children the feeling of security and love . Who cares whether a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? MARION KRuse . Mount Vernon , N. Y. Feminine attainment of a $10,000 annual income was not Miss Adams ' concern at all but was mentioned as what " used to be the test of woman 's success ( in suffragist eyes ) in 1920 . " On the contrary , Miss Adams was concerned because " women , like men , are caught in the obscure mechanisms of an industrial civilization which values them not as poets or idealists or dreamers , or even as creators of a new race ? ? ? but as workers and consumers . " ? Editor . WOMEN 'S VOTE TO THE EDITOR : Mildred Adams in " What the Women 's Vote Has Not Done " ( Aug. 20 ) writes that the League of Women Voters " chose to train the new voter as an independent , leaving her free to join her own party but refusing to lend backing to party fights . " There is purpose behind this nonpartisan policy . Any other step would be fatal . The league realizes we must have informed citizens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of women uninformed on the subject of politics and government is appalling . ? ? ? ( Mrs. ) YVONNE J.
