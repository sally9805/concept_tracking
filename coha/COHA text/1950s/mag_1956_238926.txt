When Northern newsmen covering the Negro boycott of Montgomery buses swarmed into the city room of Alabama 's Montgomery Advertiser ( circ. 60,144 ) , Editor-in-Chief Grover Cleveland Hall Jr. , 41 , did his best to answer their questions . He also asked questions-and decided from the answers that the North 's own racial sins were being covered by its press in a " conspiracy of silence . " To prove his point , Hall launched a daily series on Northern discrimination . Said he : " Whatever we reveal will not solve any problem Alabama has . Our purpose is to point out to the self-righteous North that it 's not doing so damn well either in solving the race problem . " * <P> To get the series . Reporter Tom Johnson and other staffers telephoned Northern editors and public officials to ask about discrimination in their areas . They found plenty , and Hall let the stories sprawl over his editorial page under the standing rebuking headline : <P> TELL IT NOT IN GATH , PUBLISH IT NOT IN THE STREETS OF ASKELON. +When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 5 , 1951 ) of Dearborn , Mich. , he bragged that not a single Negro could get a place to live in his city of 114,000 , though 15,000 of them worked there . Said the mayor : " I am for complete segregation , one million percent , on all levels . " <P> <P> Dirty Wash . The Advertiser 's series also reported that Chicago had assigned 150 police to the Trumbull Park development ( TIME , May 17 , 1954 ) to prevent violence over an influx of Negro residents . Hall 's wry comment noted that Chicago race relations " seem incredibly violent to a Southerner , " since " in all the Confederacy , there 's not a single Negro family I know of that needs police protection . " <P> Last week Hall angrily charged the Detroit press with burying news of the Rouse case ( TIME , April 16 ) , in which a part American Indian family was forced to move out of a Detroit neighborhood after a mob rioted around the house in the belief that they were Negroes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 , one on page 16 , and one on page 60 . One story was only three paragraphs long . Anything like that happening in Montgomery would have made the lead story in all of those papers . Yet they ignore their own dirty wash . It makes me mad . " <P> Both in Detroit and Chicago , Hall found , editors deliberately play down racial troubles in their own cities . The papers feel that full coverage of racial outbreaks might make them worse . By common consent , newspapers and radio stations in Chicago publish nothing about a tense race situation during its " incipient " stage ; if a riot actually breaks out , they report it , but in the past tense as if it had already blown over , even if it should still be raging . Concludes Hall : " The race issue is not a Southern dilemma but a national problem . Discrimination is discrimination everywhere , not just when it happens under a Southern magnolia .
