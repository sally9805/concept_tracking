Most daytime radio and TV shows seem aimed at ten-year-olds . But on Sunday the rules change . Instead of soap operas and giveaways and cosmetic hints , the Sunday audience is considered grownup enough to hear-as they did this week - readings from Christopher Marlowe 's The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus ( on NBC 's Anthology ) and to enjoy an appraisal of Ralph Waldo Emerson by the University of Southern California 's Professor Frank Baxter ( CBS ) , who pretends to be nothing more or less than an interested and interesting teacher . <P> Several explanations are offered for the cultural flowering of Sunday . According to Hubbell Robinson , CBS vice president in charge of TV programming , Sunday was chosen for culture because " that 's when the entire family is at home and receptive . " Less generous critics suggest that audience ratings are responsible ; they say that Sunday ratings have always been low , and therefore the networks moved their " worthwhile " shows into Sunday 's hours , where they would not compete with the easily salable evening time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be a refreshing , satisfying and educational U.S. institution . <P> The Fourth R. Sunday morning , naturally enough , is devotional . In the earlier hours , radio religion ranges from the evangelical thunder of Pasadena 's Rev. Herbert Armstrong ( " Catastrophic happenings will soon shake the world ! " ) to the fundamentalist tenets of Grand Rapids ' Dr. Richard De Haan ( " Read the Bible closely and never out of context . . . " ) . Television 's religious note is more often interdenominational and inspirational . This week Dr. Norman Vincent Peale ( The Power of Positive Thinking ) and his wife devoted 30 filmed minutes ( CBS ) to assuring viewers that an inferiority complex should not prevent financial success . The Peales told how a friend of theirs , a perennial business failure , utilized his return to the bosom of the church to develop a profitable line of costume jewelry : he featured the " mustard seed of faith " ( Matthew 17:20 ) in charm bracelets , clips and watch fobs . Said Dr. Peale : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . " <P> For the children , TV offered a number of nondenominational Sunday schools . On Fourth R-Religion , pretty Lori Darmi explained how bread is made , giving credit to God for the grain and to Pepperidge Farm for the skills needed to prepare the loaf . On the filmed They Live By , parents were briefed on how to answer such adolescent questions as " Where is God ? " ( the answer : " Everywhere " ) . Exploring God 's World spent an agreeable half-hour exhibiting sea shells that were shaped like harps or striped like zebras or wore fur coats ( to guard the shells against acids in Alaskan waters ) .
