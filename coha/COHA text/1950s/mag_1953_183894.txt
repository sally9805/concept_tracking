All week , excitement mounted in Teheran . Police and troops patrolled and watched the teeming streets and alleys ; in the bazaar , the secret agents were everywhere . Beneath the great plane and pine trees in the Majlis gardens , long-robed deputies bargained and pledged their support . At issue : Who should sit in the speaker 's chair of the Majlis ? Should it be evil old Mullah Kashani , the incumbent , who would deal with anybody , including the Communists , to get power ? Or should it be Premier Mossadegh 's choice , a popular lawyer named Abdullah Moazzami ? <P> The stakes were large . Said the pro-Kashani newspaper Oghab-i-Shargh : " The blood of Mossadegh , Moazzami and other enemies of freedom is now legal . " The pro-Mossadegh Jebheh Azadi spat back : " Only traitors will vote for Mr. Kashani . " And Kashani himself attacked Mossadegh in characteristic terms : " Such men should be hanged by the people . " <P> On election day in the Majlis , police cordoned off the Parliament building , searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze vases into the chamber , into either of which deputies dropped their ballots . The result : Moazzami , 41 ; Kashani , 31 . <P> The vote was a setback for Kashani , but the power of the aged little fanatic has always been in the streets , rather than the Majlis . And though Mossadegh had won one more parliamentary triumph , his power is steadily being undermined by 1 ) the unpopularity of his attempt to oust the Shah , win control of the army and set up an unopposed dictatorship ; 2 ) his failure to break the British blockade and sell crude oil to the outside world ; 3 ) the attrition of the currency ( the rial was 118 to the dollar last week , against 74 a year ago , 47 two years ago ) ; 4 ) the infiltration of government ministries by the outlawed Communist Tudeh Party . <P> Mossadegh himself scoffs at charges that his ineffective regime is leading Iran towards Communism . He leans back in his pink-painted iron cot and points to his two air conditioners , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and air coolers and a good bed like mine be a Communist ? " he asks . <P> Yet the Tudeh infiltration of Mossadegh 's government is now so deep that Communist agents can , in some cases , set government policy . Said a Westerner : " We are n't going to have a Communist coup d ' tat here . There will be nothing violent about it . We are just going to wake up one morning and say to ourselves : ' Good Lord ! We have a pro-Tudeh government ! ' Then we are going to ask ourselves when did it happen-last night ? Yesterday ? Last week ? A month ago ? And we are not going to be able to answer .
