Of all the TV networks , CBS is unquestionably the outstanding friend of the working girl . CBS has four shows devoted exclusively to the trials and tribulations of three secretaries and a schoolteacher . But , in refreshing contrast to real life , the girls are seldom asked to do much work . On Private Secretary , blonde Cinemactress Ann Sothern occasionally pecks at a typewriter , but mostly she is shown trading wisecracks with her boss ( Don Porter ) , getting mink and sable coats from the firm 's clients or having her superior business acumen vindicated ( dumb as the girls are , they are all far brighter than the men who employ them ) . <P> Meet Millie 's Elena Verdugo once in a great while carries a piece of paper from her desk to a filing cabinet , but , with that chore over , she takes it easy by necking with the boss 's son ( Ross Ford ) . My Friend Irma 's Marie Wilson is portrayed as a bosomy sub-cretin who spends her office hours listening ecstatically while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <P> As the schoolteacher in Our Miss Brooks , Eve Arden is the intellectual superior of her rivals , as evidenced by the fact that she always gets a pained expression when one of her students says " ai n't , " which they do with dismaying regularity . But not even Eve is often seen in the classroom . Usually she cruises the high-school corridors on the heels of Bob Rockwell , a biology instructor who is impervious to the most blatant advances from Teacher Brooks . In fact , much of Miss Brooks 's humor derives from remarks made innocently by Rockwell and turned into leering double entendres by Actress Arden ( e.g. , " Miss Brooks , have n't you got something for me ? " Miss B. : " Of course , you just have n't noticed " ) . <P> The shows try to maintain vague ties to reality . Two of the girls have glasses and sometimes wear them ; none of them lives in the marble-bath mansions that Hollywood ordinarily assigns to its movie working girls , and Eve Arden 's rooming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works and the phone bill is often unpaid . All the girls are surrounded by hordes of admiring friends , most of them of such astonishing eccentricity as to make televised life in the U.S. resemble visiting day at London 's 17th century Bedlam . Outstanding are Meet Millie 's Marvin Kaplin as a frustrated poet-author-composer , Private Secretary 's Marcel Dalio as a continental singer with a compulsive giveaway urge . Irma 's Donald MacBride as a terrible-tempered Mr. Bang , and Our Miss Brooks 's complete gallery of juvenile and adult delinquents.
