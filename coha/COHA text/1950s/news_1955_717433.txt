txt WASHINGTON , Oct. ** the days pass , and the time for the great political decisions of 1956 draws nearer , the dilemma of the Republicans is increasing . They can not know what possibly the President and his doctors do not know themselves at this juncture of his recovery : the effect his heart attack will have on his availability for the renomination that awaits him if he wants it . And , not knowing this , they do not know how , what and when to plan for the national campaign next year . Actually the dilemma can stay unresolved for at least a couplesof months without inflicting irreparable damage to the Republican party prospects . Not until January at the earliest need any decisions be made by those who would aspire to the party 's Presidential nomination if General Eisenhower is cot to accept it . That is the filing time for the first preference primary , which will be held in New Hampshire next March . But there are endless details of organization , for the convention and the campaign , that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President decides to retire to private life . And since every other Republican aspirant for the nomination will require an intense pre-convention build-up , which will also be a pre-campaign requirement for the choice of any of these by the convention , all are burdened with an unease they obviously can not confess . No Lack of Fealty The organizational details constitute the part of the dilemma that chiefly concerns Leonard , W. Hall , chairman of the Repub-1 lican National Committee , his staff , and the party committees in the several states . The chafing ambitions of others , ranging from Republicans who want to keep the party in power and themselves in office to Republicans who want to occupy the White House , make up the remainder of the predicament . No lack of fealty , affection or respect for the President contributes to this general restiveness . To a man their fondest wish is that he will fully recover his health and vigor and have many more years of good life . if they could hear tomorrow that le has decided , and his doctors nave approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would greet the news in a tumult ) f rejoicing . But the uncertainty s having a depressing psychoLogical effect on the party that ieepens with the passage of time , and with the clack of medical tongues in press conferences and at - doctors ' conventions where the subject is the effect of coronary attacks on occupational capacity . The neurosis is augmented , too , by the bustling in the Democratic party , where preparations for the convention and campaign of 1956 are getting off to a head start , Worrisome Facts In such circumstances it is natural for Republican political managers and potential candidates to dwell more anxiously on the facts that theirs is a numerical minority in this country and that they have been depending on a man under intense medical care to keep it in national 3ff ice . This inevitable state of mind is being unconsciously reflected in steady public utterances by party leaders . A question about the Republican future , addressed to most of them by press , radio and television reporters , is almost certain to extract a speculative answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been scrupulous in their refusal to discuss any aspect of the matter , and Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . went so far as to say , after visiting the President in the hospital , that comment on his future intentions was " inappropriate for anyone . " But many Republican politicians have refused to apply that counsel to themselves . In their sight the stakes are too great and the future too precarious for that rigid interpretation of propriety . So Senator William F. Know- , land of California , who is credited with an honorable ambition to be President , described for the inquiring press the kind of Republican candidate who should not be chosen , drawing a portrait that could be viewed as a caricature of a certain colleague.1 The Senator also speculated openly that the President would not indicate a choice of a successor if he decides not to run again . The party leader in the House of Representatives , former Speaker Joseph Martin Jr. , expressed firm belief that the President will be totally restored in vigor and view it as his duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Representative Charles A. Halleck of Indiana , said he hoped the President 's decision would be favorable , otherwise everybody in the world would suffer " a tragic loss , " but he did not believe the Presidents if retiring , would attempt to name his successor . 40 ' Strong ' Nominees Governor Goodwin J. Knight of California , atour in the East , continued to look into the crystal for anyone . He echoed Halleek 's hope but if it were dashed , he said , there are at least forty Republicans of Presidential capacity who would be " strong " nominees . Senator Styles Bridges of New Hampshire speculated on another aspect of the possible future . Perhaps he was stimulated by the thought of the approach of his own state 's primaries . But the Senate chairman of the minority policy committee  --  hence the Republican leader in his branch ? is generally not reticent , and he meditated publicly as follows : " We 'll have to wait and learn what the President 's decision is . I expect he will make an announcement when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should think he would make his plans known before the New Hampshire primary , the first of the series . " The Senator joined others in the hope that the President will soon be as good as ever and run again . But provided he does n't  --  the " if " appeared on schedule ? Bridges said he " believed " the ' President " may " designate a " group " of Republicans whom he will commend to the favorable consideration of the national convention , Republicans Restive The " inappropriate " speculation has not been confined to Republicans , though naturally the subject is primarily their concern . Even Senator Walter P. George of Georgia , a Democrat of impeccable taste and deportment , answered a reporter by saying , " I would not dare to speak for the President . But I would assume he will not run . " It is this very assumption that is making the Republicans restive under enforced inactivity , and inducing them to speculate , on request about the political consequences of the fact Opt would establish the assumption . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to relieve their worry .
