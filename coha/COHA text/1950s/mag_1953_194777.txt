MANNERS &; MORALS Flying Window Ledge <P> In recent years , big city exhibitionists , bent on suicide , headlines , or both , have taken to balancing high on window ledges while threatening to jump to the crowd-jammed streets below . It remained for a wealthy young Texas cattle rancher named Ollie William Cox to perform the same tragic stunt in an airplane . <P> At 23 , Amateur Pilot Cox seemed to have almost anything a Texan could want . <P> He owned the 2,560-acre Double Heart Ranch near Sweetwater , Texas , was his father 's partner in the operation of a 22,400-acre spread west of the Pecos River . He was married , had a three-year-old daughter , was about to become a father again . He seemed calm as he left Sweetwater 's airport in his four-passenger Cessna 170 at 5:30 one morning this week . <P> Just after dawn , the Abilene airport picked up his voice : he was announcing by radio that he planned to crash the plane in a gravel pit and kill himself as soon as he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , " he cried . For more than three hours his plane circled overhead . Friends flew to Abilene , joined airport and CAA officials in pleading with him by radio to land . Cried Cox : " If you had done what I did , you would n't land . " At 9:55 Cox put his plane into a dive , hit the ground and died in a welter of splintered fuselage and smoking metal . <P> Afterward the CAA dutifully announced a triumph of macabre bureaucracy : it had made a three-hour tape recording of Cox 's last words in the hope of revoking his pilot 's license if he did not kill himself .
