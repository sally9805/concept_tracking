Studebaker , which showed off its 1955 models early in October , last week did something rare in the auto industry . It brought out an entire series of new cars , which wags promptly dubbed " 1955 models . " In its basic Champion , Commander and President lines , Studebaker had 16 new sedan and station-wagon models with wraparound windshields , sportier dashboards and more horsepower . At the same time it boosted horsepower on its old 1955 Commanders from 140 to 162 , on Presidents from 175 to 185 . Reason for the midseason retooling was to help Studebaker compete with the Big Three 's high-h.p. wraparound windshield models .
