" I doubt that anybody ever had a better sponsor , " says Armina Marshall . " He always leaves us alone . " The hands-off sponsor is U.S. Steel , and the left-alone show is Theatre Guild on the Air ( Sun . 8:30 p.m. , NBC ) . Last week the Guild gave its 300th radio performance : a typically smooth and professional playing of Shaw 's Man and Superman , starring Deborah Kerr and Maurice Evans . As executive director of the radio Guild , fiftyish Armina Marshall concentrates on " bringing the theater into U.S. homes . " Unlike the Lux Radio Theater , which broadcasts dramatizations of movies , the Guild usually draws on Broadway ( " The only movies we ever do are classics like All About Eve and The Lost Weekend " ) . <P> Its happy relation with the sponsor is not the only unusual thing about Theatre Guild . Though the show costs $12,500 a week , the Guild nets only a relatively small profit , because " we spend a lot of money to keep our standards high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , more rehearsal time than is used for any other radio program , and as much as is used on many TV shows . Whenever possible , the original stage casts are used on the air . In some cases , as with The Winslow Boy , a play goes on radio soon after it concludes its Broadway run . The only movie actors the Guild uses , says Armina Marshall bluntly , are " those who can act . " <P> In its eight years on radio , the show has had remarkably few letters complaining of its plays or the political backgrounds of its casts ( " We just forward those letters to U.S. Steel and they answer them " ) . The biggest furor occurred when the Guild presented Tennessee Williams ' Summer and Smoke on an Easter Sunday . " It was bad timing . " concedes Armina Marshall , " because the girl in the play becomes a prostitute . Ever since then on Easter Sunday we try to do a classic . " About a dozen plays have been repeated ( e.g. , Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The biggest audiences are consistently drawn by the acting team of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne . <P> Six years ago the Guild experimentally did a series of plays on NBC 's television network , but it was agreed that " TV was n't ready for us , and we were n't ready for them . " Plans are now set for the Guild to try TV again this fall . " The only thing to be decided is who will sponsor the show , " says Armina . And she adds , warmly : " We all hope it 's going to be U.S. Steel . "
