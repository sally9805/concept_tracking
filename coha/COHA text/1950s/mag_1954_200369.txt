Ever since TIME 'S first issue ( March 3 , 1923 ) , which reported the adjournment of the 67th Congress and a review of its work , TIME has paid particular attention to the nation 's legislative body in Washington . Last week , as the second session of the 83rd Congress got down to business , TIME reporters were again busy " working the Hill . " The regular TIME reporters covering the Hill this year are James L. McConaughy Jr . and John L. Steele . In the 15 years he has been with TIME , McConaughy has been a writer . Chicago correspondent , deskman in the news bureau , bureau chief in Ottawa ( where he spent 3 years " watching the other form of democratic government work-the parliamentary system of Canada " ) and TIME 'S bureau chief in Seattle . He has covered Congress for TIME since 1951 . " I still remember my first day on the Hill , " he says . " I got blisters just running up mileage . <P> Even now a daily average is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nieman fellow and one of the Capitol 's seasoned wire-service reporters , came to TIME during the last session of Congress after a nine-year career of covering the Hill for the United Press . Shortly after he came to TIME , Steele grew used to a question from wire-service friends in the press gallery : " Now that you have a weekly deadline , have you been able to slow down ? " He found himself , says Steele , forced to answer : " I 'm just beginning to rev up . " Congress sets a fast pace for its watchful reporters . McConaughy once described the job as " trying to report six fires going simultaneously , each one threatening to get out of control , and watching 19 different fire-engine companies come roaring to the scene . Then , just as the wind rises , you get a message saying that what the editors really want to know is the amount of property damage and also a complete biography and personality sketch of the arsonist . " Actually , says McConaughy , the number of Congressmen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One day you may spend six hours in the House lobby just fishing and shooting the breeze and talk to 30 of them and get nothing . The next day one phone call will result in a story . " What is important is whom reporters get to know . TIME 'S reporters consider it a good rule of thumb to get to know all the Senators , as many of the 435 Representatives as possible . " It is particularly important in the House , " says McConaughy , " to know one top Democrat and one top Republican on each committee and one from each state delegation . That way you always have a place to begin , no matter how offbeat the story may be . " It also provides a barometer of national thinking . <P> Between the Senate Office Building and the Old House Office Building a reporter can take the pulse of Wyoming , check the price of Texas cattle , learn what is troubling Wisconsin 's Menominee Indians , get background on Mississippi politics-all by spending enough time with the right people on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
