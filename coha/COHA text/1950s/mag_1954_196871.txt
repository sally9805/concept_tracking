Until 1936 , Albert Namatjira , a husky black member of the Arunta tribe in the remote bush country of central Australia , was a camel driver . He also did odd jobs for the Lutheran mission at tiny ( pop . 242 ) Hermannsburg , 1,300 miles northwest of Sydney . The missionaries paid him in clothes and rations of European food , with which Albert supplemented the native " bush tucker " of kangaroo meat , honey ants and fat grubs . <P> Today , 51-year-old Albert Namatjira is one of Australia 's most popular and successful artists . His bright , pleasant watercolors of the rugged scenery around Hermannsburg sell in Melbourne , Sydney , Adelade and Brisbane for as much as $170 , and last year he earned about $5,000 from the products of his brush . <P> <P> Fast Learner . Namatjira 's rise started when two Melbourne artists , Rex Battarbee and John Gardner , came to the bush on a painting trip and showed some of their watercolors to the Hermannsburg aborigines . Albert was fascinated . He brooded about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition : he would serve Battarbee as camel boy if Battarbee would teach him to paint . Battarbee agreed , supplied Albert with brushes and paints , and gave him a few pointers on color . Two weeks later , as Battarbee recalls , " Albert brought along a painting ... I immediately saw his talent . Here was a man , a full-blooded aborigine who had in two weeks absorbed my color sense . I felt he had done the job so well that he had no need to learn more from me about color . " <P> <P> That was in 1936 . Namatjira learned so fast that within a few months he had sold his first watercolor . Price : five shill ings . By 1945 his pictures were so much in demand that 43 watercolors in a Sydney show were sold in 20 minutes , for nearly 1,000 . <P> Since then , Albert has been able to sell everything he paints . The example of his fat income-which under tribal custom he must share not only with his wife and six children but with hordes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring up at Hermannsburg . Today Hermannsburg has 18 painters ( including three of Namatjira's. sons ) , who collectively gross nearly $8,000 a year . Some of Namatjira 's followers , many critics think , are doing better work than the master , whom they regard as too slick . One of the best is Edwin Pareroultja , also a tribesman , who turns out imaginative landscapes that are refreshingly unsophisticated and less imitative of European style than Namatjira 's . <P> <P> Good Tucker . Last week Painter Namatjira was back in his simple wooden house in Hermannsburg after his first trip to eastern Australia . Albert made the 1,200-mile journey to Canberra in response to a gold-crested invitation to meet his sovereign . Queen Elizabeth II . After being presented to the Queen , he attended a lavish state ball where the tables groaned with caviar and pheasant . Commented Albert , who still eats honey ants at home : " Good tucker . " <P> <P> From Canberra . Albert went to Sydney and to Melbourne , where he attended his first big art exhibition . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was horrified at modern abstractions . <P> " That sort of painting is not for me. " he said . After he left the gallery , he was mobbed by 400 fans , most of them women , who cried : " Good on you , Albert ! "
