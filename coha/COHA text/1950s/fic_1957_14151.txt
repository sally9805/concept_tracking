Door into the hall at the back . All we need see are an elaborate , but not weighty , table in the center and two chairs . At the front of the stage are some andirons and a poker , indicating a fireplace . Mallison , fifty-nine , all a lawyer , now very nervous , is standing before the table holding an open watch in his hand . By the door is Bernice , colored , fifty , in a maid 's uniform . MR . MALLISON Remind me remind me , please your name ? MAYHEW ( Unimpressed ) : Bernice . MR . MALLISON Thank you .  --  Now Mr. Burgess , your employer , may be a little bit moody . You do whatever he wants . Have you enough help to run the house ? MAYHEW I did what you told me . There 's Jason for the heavy work and the furnace . This Mr. Burgess  --  will he be alone in this house ? MR . MALLISON Alone ? Oh ! Most probably . At all events , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am Mr. Burgess 's lawyer , but he will be getting another lawyer soon . All your bills will be paid , I 'm sure You have some dinner waiting for him now ? MAYHEW ( Slowly ) : Why do you talk so funny about this Mr. Burgess ? Is he coming from the crazy house or something ? p. 3 MR . MALLISON ( Outraged ) : No , indeed ! ! I do n't know where you got such an idea . All that 's expected of you is uh good meals and a well-run house . MAYHEW You talk very funny , Mr. Mallison . MR . MALLISON ( After swallowing with dignity and glaring at her ) : Mrs. Willard recommended you as an experienced cook and housekeeper , Bernice . My duty ends there . MAYHEW I do n't have to take any jobs unless I likes them , Mr. Mallison . I never agrees to work any place more than three days . Mrs. Willard do n't like it , but that 's my terms  --  if I likes it , I stays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . You 're getting very well paid and you can ask for any further help you need  --  within reason . There 's an automobile stopping before the door now . I think you 'd better go to the door . ( Bernice does n't move . Arms akimbo she looks musingly at Mallison . ) MAYHEW I seen people like you before You 're up to something . ( The front door bell rings . ) MR . MALLISON I do n't like your tone . You 've been engaged to work here  --  for three days , anyway . You can begin by answering that door bell . ( Bernice goes out . Mallison straightens his clothes , goes to the table and picks up his briefcase , then stands waiting with pursed lips . Sounds of altercation from the hall. ) p. 4 DRIVER All right ! The price is twenty dollars . But if I 'd know 'd it was a night like this  --  ( Enter the Driver , a livery stable chauffeur , Irish , slightly drunk . He is carrying a small rattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is followed by Walbeck , forty-seven , prematurely gray ; he speaks softly , but gives an impression of controlled power . Bernice enters behind them . ) MR . WALBECK ( To Mallison , in a low voice ) : I understood that the fare was paid in advance ? MR . MALLISON The twenty dollars was paid in advance . DRIVER Anybody 'd charge twice to drive on a night like this . First it was rain and snow  --  MR . MALLISON The livery stable was given twenty dollars  --  ( To Bernice ) You can prepare the dinner ! ( Exit Bernice . ) DRIVER Then it turned to ice . The worst night I 've ever seen , to go to Joliet and pick up a I-don't-know-what . The car falling off the road every minute . To go to Joliet and pick up a criminal of some sort  --  MR . WALBECK ( Gesture of empty pockets ) : I have no money . MR . MALLISON ( To the driver ) : I will give you five dollars , but I shall report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking the bill ) : What do I care ? Thirty-five miles each way and half the time you could n't see the road five yards in front of you ; and the other half sliding into the ditch . All right , tell em and see what I tell ' em . MR . MALLISON You have your five dollars . If you go now , I 'll say nothing to your superiors  --  But go ! DRIVER ( Starting for the door , then turning on Walbeck ) : And who do you think you are , Mr. Bur-gessss ! Keeping your mouth so shut ! You a murderer or I-don't-know-what ; and too big and mighty to talk to anybody .  --  Oh , you had to think , did you ? So you had to think ? Well , you 've got enough to think about for the rest of your goddamned life . ( He goes out . ) MR . MALLISON ( Stiffly ) : Good evening , Mr. Walbeck . ( The front door is heard closing with a slam . ) MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this name of Burgess ? MR . MALLISON We assumed , Mr. Walbeck , that you would prefer us to engage the household staff and make certain other arrangements under another name . Since you did not reply to our letters on this matter , we selected the name of Burgess . p. 6 MR . WALBECK I see .  --  Is my wife here ? MR . MALLISON ( Astonished ) : You did not get Mrs. Walbeck 's letters ? MR . WALBECK I did not open any letters . MR . MALLISON And our letters , Mr. Walbeck ? MR . WALBECK I have n't opened any letters for six months . MR . MALLISON ( Controlling his outrage , primly ) : Mrs. Walbeck left a week ago  --  with the children  --  for California . She has filed a petition for divorce . In her letters she probably explained it to you at length . She did not wish to make this move earlier She wished it to be known that she stood by you through your ordeal . When she heard that your sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , she  --  MR . WALBECK ( Coolly ) : There 's no need to say anything more , Mr. Mallison . MR . MALLISON A woman has been engaged to attend to your needs . Her name is Bernice . A wardrobe  --  that is , a wardrobe of clothes  --  you will find upstairs . Your measurements were obtained by your former tailor from the authorities at the institution from which you have come .  --  Here are the keys of the house . Here are the statements from your bank . A checkbook . Here ( He places a long envelope on the table ) are five hundred dollars which I have drawn for your immediate needs . p. 7 MR . WALBECK Thank you . Good night . MR . MALLISON Mr. Walbeck , hitherto the firm of Bremerton , Bremerton , Mallison and Mallison has been happy to serve as your legal representatives . From now on we trust that you will find other counsel . We relinquish  --  here ( He lays down another document ) our power of attorney . And in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our successors will require . I wish you good night . MR . WALBECK ( Stonily ) : Good night . ( Mallison turns at the door . ) MR . MALLISON You read no letters ? MR . WALBECK ( His eyes on the ground ) : No . MR . MALLISON That reminds me . Your daughter Lavinia wished to leave a letter for you . Her mother forbade her to do so . However , I I was prepared to take the responsibility . Your daughter gave me this letter to give to you . ( He gives an envelope to Walbeck , who puts it in his breast pocket . His silence and level glance complete Mallison 's discomfiture . ) Good night , sir . ( Exit Mallison . Walbeck stands motionless gazing fixedly before him . Suddenly , in a rage , he overturns the table before him ; but immediately recovers his self-control . Enter Bernice. ) p. 8 MAYHEW Dinner 's served , sir . MR . WALBECK I wo n't have any dinner . MAYHEW Yes , Mr. Burgess . MR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Burgess . " I 'll just set that table to rights . MR . WALBECK ( Quickly ) : I 'll do it . ( He does . ) MAYHEW ( Watchfully but unsentimentally ) : I 've got a real good steak in there . I 'm the best cook in Chicago , Mr. Burgess . There 's lots of people that knows that . MR . WALBECK Is there any liquor in the house ? MAYHEW Oh , yes . There 's everything . MR . WALBECK Rye . Rye straight .  --  You eat the steak . MAYHEW Thank you , Mr. Burgess . ( She starts out , then turns . ) Now , you do n't want to eat that steak , Mr. Burgess , but I 've got some tomato soup there that 's the best tomato soup you ever ate . You are n't going to waste my time by refusing to eat that soup . MR . WALBECK ( Looking at her ; impersonally ) : What is your name ? p. 9 MAYHEW My name 's Bernice Mayhew . People calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to eat in that dining room . You can bring me the rye and some of that soup in here . MAYHEW Yes , Mr. Burgess . MR . WALBECK My name is Walbeck . MAYHEW What 's that ? MR . WALBECK My name : Wal-beck , Walbeck . MAYHEW Yes , Mr. Walbeck . MR . WALBECK And pour yourself some rye . MAYHEW I do n't touch it , Mr. Walbeck . Ten years ago I made my life over . I changed my name and I changed everything about myself . I thank you , but I do n't touch liquor . ( She goes out . Walbeck , standing straight , his eyes on the ground , puts his hand in his pocket and draws out his daughter 's letter . After a moment 's hesitation , he opens it . He holds it suspended in his hand a moment . Then he tears the letter and envelope , each two ways , and throws the fragments into the fire ( invisible to us ) , between the andirons.Bernice returns , pushing a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfurls a tablecloth and starts laying the table . Walbeck drinks half the rye in one swallow. ) p. 10 MR . WALBECK Were you here when my wife was here ? MAYHEW No , sir . Nobody 's been here today but that lawyer-man . I came here this morning and all day Jason and I have been cleaning the house . MR . WALBECK Do you know where I come from ? MAYHEW ( Quietly , lowered eyes ) : Yes , I do . MR . WALBECK Did that lawyer tell you ? MAYHEW No I knew I been there myself So I knew . I 'll get your soup . ( She goes out . Suddenly Walbeck goes to the fireplace . Falling on his knees , he tries without burning his fingers to rake out the fragments of the letter . Apparently it is too late . Bernice enters with a covered soup tureen . Watchfully , but with no show of surprise , she tries to take in what he is doing . Walbeck rises , dusting off his knees . ) You want me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WALBECK No , it 's all right as it is . ( He seats himself at the table . ) MAYHEW ( Eyeing the fireplace speculatively ) : There 's some toast there , too . MR . WALBECK You say you changed your name ? p. 11 MAYHEW Yes . My born name was Sarah Temple . When I came out of prison I was Bernice Mayhew . Of course , I had some other names too . I was married twice . But Bernice Mayhew was the name I gave myself . ( Without emphasis ; her eyes on the distance ) I was in because I killed somebody . MR . WALBECK ( The soup spoon at his mouth , speaks in her tone ) : I was in because I cheated two or three hundred people out of money . MAYHEW ( Musingly ) : Well , everybody 's done something . ( Pause . Walbeck eats . ) MR . WALBECK You say you changed everything about yourself ? MAYHEW Yes . Everything was changed , anyway . I was in a disgrace  --  nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And some people were avoiding me and some people were laughing at me and some people were being kind to me , like I was a dog that came to the back door . And some people were saying : cheer up , Sarah , you 've paid your price . There 's lots of things to live for . You 're young yet .  --  You 're sure you would n't like a piece of that steak , Mr. Walbeck , rare or any way you 'd like it ? MR . WALBECK No . I 'm going downtown soon . If I get hungry , later , I 'll pick up something to eat down there . p. 12 MAYHEW ( After a short pause , while she continues to gaze into the distance ) : Did anybody come to meet you when you came out of the door of the place you was at ? MR . WALBECK No . MAYHEW That 's what I mean . I do n't blame them . I would n't want to go round with a person who 's very much in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody . I would n't choose ' em . MR . WALBECK Or with a person who 's stolen a lot of people 's life savings . MAYHEW I only mentioned that to show a big part of the change : you 're alone . MR . WALBECK Did that lawyer who was here , or the agency , know that you 'd been in prison ? MAYHEW Oh , no . It was Sarah Temple who did that . She 's dead . When I changed my name she became dead . You see the first part of my life I lived in Kansas City . Then I came to Chicago . Bernice Mayhew has never been to Kansas City . She do n't even know what it looks like . MR . WALBECK ( Impersonally , without looking at her ) : If you 've been on your feet all day cleaning the house , I think you 'd better sit down , Bernice . MAYHEW Well , thank you , I will sit down . p. 13 MR . WALBECK Would you advise me to kill off George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her musings ) : Not so much for your sake as for other people 's sake . It 's not good for other people to have to do with persons who are in a disgrace ; it brings out the worst in them . I do n't like to see that . MR . WALBECK ( Slowly , his eyes on the distance ) : I guess you 're right . I 'd better do that . MAYHEW It 's like what happens about poor people . You 're a thousand times richer than I am , but I 'm richer than millions of people . What good does it do to think about them ? I only need one real meal a day ; the rest is just stuffing . But I do n't notice as how I give up my other two meals . I 'm always right there at mealtimes . When I went hungry , most times I did n't let people know about it ; and when I 'm in a disgrace , why should I make them uncomfortable ? MR . WALBECK Before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAYHEW Yes , I did Their mother 's dead , of course . But I guess somebody 's reminding them every day that their mother was a murderer .  --  That 's bad enough , but it 's not as bad as knowing their mother 's alive .  --  Have you noticed that we gradually forgive them that 's dead ? If I was alive they 'd be thinking about me , in one way or another : hating me or maybe trying to stand up for me . There are a lot of ideas young people could go through about a thing like that . p. 14 MR . WALBECK ( As though to himself ) : Yes . ( The telephone rings in the hall . Walbeck rises uneasily . ) Who could that be ? Answer it , will you , Bernice ? Do n't say that I 'm here . ( Bernice goes into the hall . Her voice can be heard shouting as though she were unaccustomed to the telephone . ) MAYHEW It 's me talking  --  Bernice.Yes . Who are you , talking ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear you , a letter.Yes , miss . What ? I ca n't hear good . The machine do n't work good.All right , you come . I 'm here.Bernice . Yes , you come . I 'm here . ( Bernice returns to the stage . ) She says she 's your daughter . MR . WALBECK So-o-o ! She did n't go to California with her mother . MAYHEW She says she sent you a letter . In the letter she asked you to telephone her that she could come and see you . She was asking over and over again if you was here , but I made out that the machine did n't work good . She says she 'll be here soon . ( Bernice has been clearing the table , putting the objects on the wheeled service table , which she starts pushing to the door . ) MR . WALBECK I ca n't see her tonight .  --  What do you suppose she wants ? p. 15 MAYHEW ( At the door with lowered eyes ) : I think I can figger that out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . She wants to make a home for you . And to give up her life for you . ( She goes out with the service table . ) MR . WALBECK ( Softly ) : Good God  --  ( Bernice returns and stands at the door . ) She 's seventeen ! How could she get such an idea ! Her mother must have told her what she thought of me  --  told her every day for eight years what she thought of me  --  MAYHEW ( Always without looking at him , broodingly ) : Yes . ( Slight pause . ) Mr. Walbeck , you ought to know that women do n't believe what women say . Least of all their mothers . They 'll believe any old fool thing a man says . MR . WALBECK She 's seventeen ! How did she do it ? How did she get away from her mother ? She must have run away at the railway station . She probably has very little money . MAYHEW ( " Seeing " it ; staring before her ) : She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be selling them . She 'll be going to the stores hunting for a job . MR . WALBECK ( Staring at her ) : Yes .  --  But her mother will have come back to look for her . Or will have telephoned the police to look for her . p. 16 MAYHEW Maybe not . Maybe not at all It 's terrible when young girls are brave . MR . WALBECK ( In a sort of terror . For the first time loudly ) : Bernice !  --  What shall I do ? MAYHEW ( A quick glance of somber anger ) : It ai n't right to ask advices . It ai n't right , Mr. Walbeck . MR . WALBECK See here , Bernice ! Do this for me . MAYHEW Do what , for you ? MR . WALBECK Do what you 'd do , if it were your own daughter . MAYHEW ( Sudden flood of tormented emotion ) : How do I know if I did right ?  --  What I did about my own daughter ? Maybe my daughter 'd be having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just having one of them silly lives , living with silly people and saying jabber  --  jabber silly things all day . ( Gazing before her ) I hate people who do n't know that lots of people is hungry and that lots of people has done bad things . If my daughter was with me , we 'd talk I got so many things I 've learned that I could tell to a girl like that And we 'd go downtown and we 'd shop for her clothes together and talk I 've got a weak heart ; I should n't get excited . ( She looks at the floor a minute ) No , Mr. Walbeck , do n't ask me to throw your daughter back into the trashy lives that most people live . p. 17 MR . WALBECK Bernice : when she comes , give her her choice . I 'll go upstairs . MAYHEW Young people ca n't make choices . They do n't know what they 're choosing . MR . WALBECK ( With increasing almost choked urgency ) : Then tell her she and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start a new life . ( Bernice is silent a moment . Then her mood changes . For the first time she brings a long deep gaze toward him . ) MAYHEW No !  --  These are just fancies . We 're a stone around their necks now ! If we were with them we 'd be a bigger stone . Sometimes I think death come into the world so we would n't be a stone around young people 's necks . Besides you and I  --  we 're alone . We did what we did because we were that kind of person  --  the kind that chooses to think they 're smarter and better than other people And people that think that way end up alone . We 're not company for anybody . ( Pause . Walbeck 's mood also changes . ) MR . WALBECK ( His mind made up ) : Then tell her that the doctors told me that I had only a few months to live that I 've gone off so as not to be a weight on anybody on her , for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If she 's not followed her mother to California , she 'll be needing some money . Give her this envelope . ( His tormented urgency returns ) And tell her Tell her p. 18 MAYHEW ( Somberly but largely ) : I knows what else to tell her , Mr. Walbeck . You go upstairs and hide youself . You 's almost dead . You 's dyin ' . ( Walbeck goes out . Bernice sits in a chair facing the audience , waiting , her eyes on the distance. )
