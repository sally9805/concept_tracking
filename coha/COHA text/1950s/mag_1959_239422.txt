Not since the late Senator Joe McCarthy 's virulent attack on Brigadier General Ralph Zwicker* had the nation witnessed such a bitter and protracted personal assault by a member of Congress . Last week , in the memorable clash of the Senator v. the Ambassador , a presidential mission was compromised , and from the floor of the Senate reckless charges were cast against the integrity of U.S. diplomatic policy . Chief figures in the Page One drama : <P> CLARE BOOTHE LUCE , 56 , playwright ( The Women , Margin for Error ) , wife of Editor in Chief Henry R. Luce of TIME , LIFE and FORTUNE , sometime G.O.P. Congresswoman from Connecticut ( 1943-47 ) and Ambassador to Italy ( 1953-57 ) , who was nominated by President Eisenhower in late February to be Ambassador to Brazil . <P> WAYNE LYMAN MORSE , 58 , third-term Senator from Oregon , onetime law professor , longtime political migrant who has been in turn a Progressive , Republican ( until late ' 52 ) , Independent and Democrat ; credited with one of the Senate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( he once orated nonstop for 22 hr. 26 min. ) , unpredictability , ferocity in debate , and a capacity for nursing grudges . <P> " Very Intemperate . " When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took up Clare Luce 's nomination in mid-April , it seemed likely that confirmation would be a simple formality ; she had been confirmed unanimously by the Senate for her mission to Rome in 1953 , and had come home with the praise of the Italians , of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and many a Democratic Senator . This time both the President and Secretary Dulles had given her warm endorsement , and Brazil 's government and press had welcomed her appointment to Rio with notable enthusiasm . <P> But from the start the open hearing was unexpectedly rough . Out of the blue , Arkansas ' Democrat William Fulbright , committee chairman , began carping about the witness ' G.O.P. partisanship in old political speeches . Then Wayne Morse took over . He lashed at Mrs. Luce 's statement , voiced during the 1944 presidential campaign , that Franklin Roosevelt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war because he did not have the political courage to lead us into it . " Witness Luce conceded to Morse that " the language was very intemperate , and would not have been used by me if I had the experience which I now have . " Unmollified , Morse badgered her about her statement in the 1948 political campaign that Harry Truman was " handpicked by big-city bosses . " <P> Switching to Italy , Morse accused the witness of having used her influence as U.S. ambassador to try to get the Italian government to change its oil policy and let private capital into oil exploration and development . Said Mrs. Luce : " I was the instrument of my country 's policy . I had no private policy of my own , and certainly I had no oil policy of my own ... I tried , as my predecessor had tried ... to persuade the Italians that they would be far better off if they would develop their own subsoil riches , and that this could be most quickly done , since they did not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee got around to voting on whether to okay Nominee Luce , the tally was 16 to 1 in favor .
