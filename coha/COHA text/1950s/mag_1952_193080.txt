All along the civilian production front last week , squawks of anguish pierced the air . The defense mobilizers , anxious to speed up the laggard flow of guns , announced second-quarter production quotas which made a deeper slash into civilian goods than most businessmen had expected . The casualties : <P> The housing industry , which started 1,000,000 houses last year and had expected enough materials to produce 800,000 this year , will get only enough materials to build 600,000 . The appliance industry , which had expected to maintain the 1951 last-quarter production , got another stiff 10% slash ( to 45% of pre-Korea output ) . <P> Only the auto industry , which did its squawking early and was plagued by unemployment , got a bigger slice . Its steel quota , originally set for 800,000 cars , was boosted to 900,000 . But there was a big catch : the industry will get only enough copper and aluminum for 800,000 cars , will have to stretch it or find substitutes . So far , substitutes have not proved too practical . General Motors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found them rusting so badly that G.M. estimated it would spend $5,000,000 replacing the defective units . <P> Mobilization Boss Charles E. Wilson , aware that civilian production could scarcely stand any more slashes , also started moving in on the defense-supporting industries which now take a large part of all U.S. steel . He trimmed the steel for freight-car production from 9,500 cars a month last year to 5,000.
