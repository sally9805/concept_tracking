Whenever he stepped into the White House Cabinet Room last week , the President of the U.S. ran spang up against a sight that made him wince . Around the room were stretched easeled posters on which the progress or lack of progress of his 1957 legislative program had been dutifully drawn in grease pencil . The pencil marks were hardly encouraging ; Dwight Eisenhower 's associates got the impression of a man hurt and angry . <P> " Of course I am disappointed , " the President told reporters at his news conference , " because these things that I talk about are not pet projects of my own . I have no particular personal reason other than that of a concern for all of the United States of America for wanting them passed , but that reason is governing and controlling for me . " <P> <P> Factions and Fractions . There was good reason for disappointment . With Congress on the verge of adjourning , the President at last count had seen only 15.8% of this session 's proposals passed , large and small . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halcyon days of 1953 it was a whopping 72.7% . There was precedent for this downward trend of the percentages . Harry Truman , battling violently against his final Democratic Congress , managed to push , pull and maneuver through only a fraction of his requests . And Franklin Roosevelt , in his later terms , had to deal with a Democratic Congress that was in open revolt , a Senate Majority Leader ( Alben Barkley ) who resigned rather than back him , and a Senate that was in a mood to make a rare gesture by voting down the nomination of Henry Wallace for Secretary of Commerce . <P> Dwight Eisenhower 's problems were different from those of Harry Truman or Franklin Roosevelt . In the 85th Congress , controlling Democrats who were cautious about speaking out against Ike in previous years have spent the session turning him down on such major issues as civil rights , the budget , mutual security , school construction . Their confident unity was simply analyzed : Democrats , since Congress convened last January , have been preparing a record for 1958 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign . And they early decided that they had little to worry about from a President who in spite of his soaring personal popularity can not run again and is not truly popular with the Old Guard elements of his own party . <P> Clear and Unqualified . In addition to Democratic campaigning , there were other , basic problems . One was the President 's own personal philosophy of the Presidency , i.e. , that he should propose and the Congress should dispose , without any pressures or threats or maneuvers from the White House . Another was the fact that he has had no Senate leader to match the wiles of the Democrats ' skillful Lyndon Johnson of Texas . <P> Last week both politicians and reporters wondered whether Dwight Eisenhower 's experiences with the 85th Congress would prompt him to alter his philosophy . Did he plan to wage a Truman-type " Give ' em hell " campaign next year against the men who had opposed his programs ? His no was clear and unqualified . Said he at the press conference : " I will just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
