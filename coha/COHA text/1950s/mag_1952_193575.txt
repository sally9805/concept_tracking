Kaiser-Frazer cut prices on its Henry J models this week , thanks chiefly to the fact that , with the metal supply easing , K-F no longer must rely on high-cost conversion steel . The cuts , ranging from $100 to $168 , put the lowest priced Henry Js $176 to $266 below the lowest Ford , Chevrolet and Plymouth .
