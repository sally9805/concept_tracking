Homeward bound to Los Angeles , the S.S. Bright Star was leaving the northern reach of the Philippines when the watch saw dense white clouds of smoke bursting out of the bosom of the Pacific . The Bright Star 's skipper reported to Manila that an underwater volcano seemed to be erupting in the vicinity of Didicas Rocks , uninhabited islets some 70 miles off the coast of Luzon . <P> A U.S. Air Force plane took off from Clark Field last week with a group of newsmen . From a distance , the flyers could spot a towering column of smoke and steam that cut through the haze like a high-piled thunderhead . Closer in , they dropped down to observe green acres of ocean that were boiling and rolling . In the center of that vast caldron , breaking 250 feet above the surface , the crater of a new volcano could be seen belching clouds of gas and great black boulders . <P> The same area has given birth in the past to another volcano , which only disappeared after a time beneath eroding waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but civil and military officials along the north coast of Luzon are preparing their towns for the tidal wave that may follow its appearance . <P> " Take away the water , " said a government vulcanologist , " and there 's no difference between this volcano and land volcanoes . It is in the process of building up a cone . Most likely it has been in that process for centuries . " Superstitious natives think otherwise . Some say the Didicas Rocks are the steeples of an old Spanish church , submerged long ago by God to punish some wicked Spanish friars . The smoking crater , they insist , is a hole in the church dome , a chimney for incense being burned by the long-dead friars as an act of repentance . <P> <P> About 70 miles to the south , on the tiny island of Camiguin in the Mindanao Sea , a violent earthquake warned natives that towering Hibok-Hibok might be preparing for another eruption . Last December its molten lava and deadly gases killed hundreds of Camiguenos ( TIME , Dec. 17 ) . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky above the volcano is an almost sure sign that the lava has again boiled close to the rim of the crater . <P> Despite the danger , Camiguenos who have returned home are unwilling to leave . President Quirino , they say , promised them land on Mindanao if they migrated after the last eruption . They found nothing but broken promises . It may take another disaster to uproot them again .
