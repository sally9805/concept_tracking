In Panmunjom last week U.N . and Communist staff officers worked patiently amid piles of maps , charts and aerial photos . Their job : to pinpoint the demarcation line from which both armies will withdraw when an armistice is signed . Their difficulty : the line will not become final until the signing , and meanwhile , it was not holding still ( see below ) . Already , Communist gains on the eastern front were forcing the negotiators to move the line south . Staff officers were well aware that men were dying as they talked , but theirs was a painstaking job , and it could not be rushed . " So far , " said a top U.S. commander , " we have hit no major snag . " <P> At week 's end Lieut . General Maxwell Taylor spoke to his troops by radio . Said he : " An armistice does not mean the war is over . . . We must constantly be on the alert and ready for a resumption of hostilities , in case . . . the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must show patience and good judgment . . . Every commander must stress the readiness for combat . . . There must be no thought of going home until permanent peace and stability have been restored in Korea . . . Every commander must study closely the terms of the armistice . . . Every man . . . must understand exactly what he can and can not do under these terms . Every commander will be held responsible for the compliance of his troops . . . <P> " The signing of an armistice will not be an occasion for celebration or boisterous conduct . While ... we may rejoice when combat casualties end , as determined soldiers we recognize that much remains to be done . . . The armistice is not a peace-it is only a pause in the fighting . " <P> Taylor 's words were sobering . But to the embattled troops who were beating off new Chinese attacks while he spoke , even a mere pause in the fighting would have been welcome .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
