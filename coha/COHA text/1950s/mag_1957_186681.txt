Elected mayor of New Orleans in 1946 , deLesseps Story Morrison took one good look at that provocative grande dame among U.S. cities and made a worried diagnosis : the old lady was dangerously ill with municipal thrombosis , high blood pressure and cancer . Morrison set out to cure all three and rejuvenate her as well . Last week , celebrating his eleventh anniversary as mayor by dedicating an eleven-story , $8,000,000 , glass-and-class city hall , " Chep " Morrison , 45 , proudly and properly declared his girl well out of danger and enjoying a new uplift from skyline to dockside . <P> " Our thrombosis , " Morrison explains , " was the traffic strangulation caused by five separate railroad stations , 144 grade crossings , the five-mile-long New Basin Canal with its lift bridges . Hypertension was the pressure on the downtown nerve center because of a lack of parking space and too great a concentration of people in a few buildings . The third of the municipal ailments was the slum cancer . " <P> Big Dose . Looking around for assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans businessmen painfully aware of the illness , anxious to help , and even ready to accept the cost in time and taxes of the medicines he prescribed . The New Orleans antidote : <P> A $57 million union terminal program to replace the five antiquated depots with one modern station , eliminate 144 grade crossings . <P> Widening of 39 boulevards to speed traffic into the city , and filling the unused New Basin Canal which slowed crosstown traffic . <P> Demolition of the worst 1,500 of New Orleans ' 42,000 substandard buildings to make way for an eleven-acre civic center that will include , beside the new city hall , a Supreme Court building ( due for completion this fall ) , a public library , a state office building and a civil court . <P> Replacement of 9,500 other slum units with federal housing projects , rejuvenation of 15,000 more by a coordinated municipal program in which the city persuaded slum landlords to make repairs , took legal action when persuasion failed . <P> Construction of a $65 million cantilever bridge across the Mississippi to New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of bridging the river . <P> Creation of an assembly center by adding a sports arena and opera house-concert hall to the present municipal auditorium . <P> New Maxim . Morrison 's medicine has attracted industry to New Orleans , prompted private capital to construct 25 major buildings in eleven years , raised property values in once dilapidated areas from 95 a square foot to $25 . But it has done something even more important . Morrison next year is an odds-on favorite to win a fourth term , is being talked about as a potential governor of Louisiana or U.S. Senator . His success demonstrates a political maxim that last-hurrahing wardheelers across the U.S. are rapidly learning : a hard-nosed , hard-pushed program of municipal reconstruction can do more than patronage , back-scratching or the food basket to put a modern-day mayor on the road to political success .
