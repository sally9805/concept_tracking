Comparing A.P . and U.P . accounts of a nudist beauty contest near London last week , the Chicago Tribune was puzzled . Both wire services reported that Miss Ivy Young , 25 , a London clerical worker had won the title " Miss British Nudist 1953 . " The A.P . called Ivy a " comely brunette " ; the U.P . said she was a blonde . " Pondering the discrepancy , the Tribune chided : " Remember that reporting the bare facts is not enough . Get a little color into your stories , but get the colors right . " Ivy herself gave the right one : " I 'm a natural blonde , and that 's straight from the horse 's mouth . " The A.P . did not cover the event , picked up the account ( and error ) from an unobservant British newsman.
