A Story by JOHN J. ESPEY Drawings by Richard E. Davis BIRD-WATCHER the sliding glass doors Harry ? " He grunted , not taking his eye off the tree , and said , " Triller 's up there . We thought he 'd got to know us so we let him out of his cage and he just flew through the open window and came here . " " Oh , " I said , looking up through the dark green leaves of the walnut . Just then Harry let fly , and I caught a flash of yellow as a good-sized canary hopped awkwardly from one twig to another and let out a frightened squeak . Harry must have scooped up a handful of gravel from my driveway and now he was getting set to throw again . " Just what 's your plan ? " I asked . Harry let fly again , and I must say his throwing arm was n't bad . The stone zipped past Triller and fell on the lawn . " Well , " Harry said , " I thought perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really hurt him ? " I asked . " I had n't thought of that , " Harry said , throwing once more . This time he came very close , and the canary fluttered up clumsily and with a crazy staggering flight left the walnut tree in the patio and made for one near the southwest corner of our lot . He missed his first landing , tottered wildly , and then got hold of a lower twig where he held on after fluttering his wings . Harry followed , and I followed . Harry . " I did n't even know you had a canary , " I said . " We have n't for very long , " Harry said , getting set again . " Betty 's mother breeds them down in San Diego and Triller is one of her prize males . She gave him to the girls . I 'll be in a real mess if we lose Triller . " Once more Harry came very close to Triller , who took oft uncertainly , this time to a walnut tree in the southeast corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are both built in an old walnut grove near the west end of the San Fernando Valley . When real estate became more profitable than walnuts , the owners subdivided and we have about a dozen trees on our acre . There ought to be a better word than neighbors to describe our relation with the Bauers , but I do n't know what it is . I call him Harry and he calls me jack , but our wives call each other Mrs. Bauer and Mrs. Thomas . The Bauers ' two daughters , Phyllis and Irene , play with our two daughters , Martha and Jane , but my wife Mary and his wife Betty would n't dream of setting foot in each other 's houses . Harry and I , on the other hand , are familiar with each other 's garages ; he never hesitates to borrow a chisel 59 or a hammer from me , and I sometimes use his power saw and drill . I suppose one thing that makes for this mixture of familiarity and distance is the fact that Harry sells insurance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English , at that  --  which always seems to bother people like Harry . Harry kept sailing stones all over my yard and Triller was traveling from one walnut tree to another with his pitching flight . " You could really hurt that bird , " 1 said . " Well , how would you try to catch Triller ? " Harry demanded . " If you just leave his cage outside , he 'll come back when he gets hungry , " I said . " Cage-birds are n't very enterprising about feeding themselves . " " Is that true about the cage ? " Harry asked . " It 's what everyone says , " I answered . " I do n't know what my mother-in-law will do if we do n't get him back , " Harry said . He stopped throwing the gravel , and I thought that with luck my power mower would n't get more than ten or twelve nicks the next day . An amazing thing happened then . Triller let out a burst of song , a long melodic phrase , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree in the patio , landing with confidence . He let out another phrase of throaty warbling , hopped up from the twig , and came down in perfect balance . U P T 0 that time I had n't thought much about Triller himself . He was a striking bird , I saw now , deep yellow with an undertone of orange , and a fine black slash across each wing . Set there against the hot blue August sky above the leaves of the walnut he made a handsome sight . But it was what Triller had been able to do that excited me . I am , after all , a teacher  --  educator , if you insist  --  and my life is based on the assumption that it is possible to teach things . There are times when the assumption is obviously a myth , but on rare occasions something happens , and I go on with half-confidence in the illusion . Trifler could learn . He was , to use a pretentious word , educable . In about fifteen minutes Triller had started learning to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself on Trifler 's side . From that moment on , you could say that Triller was my boy . " Look , Harry , " I said , " I do n't think you 'll ever get him this way . " " You may be right , " he said . We started down my driveway . Trifler had flown over the house : - ad perched in the walnutin the middle of our front lawn . Every now and then he tried out his voice . We had reached the end of the drive when another exciting thing happened . In our end of the valley , a mixed flock of finches comes through . twice a day , in the morning and in the afternoon . The core of this flock is a dozen or more house finches , but it usually includes a few white-crowned sparrows , some English sparrows , and , in the winter or even in a very dry summer , two or three Sierra juncos . This flock comes through , gleaning seeds and chattering away in the restless , fife-loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they swept to the ground under the shrubs by our front fence , and after a couple of experimental calls , he swooped from the tree to a fair landing at the edge of the flock . With his brilliant orange-yellow body and black-slashed wings , he was a splash of color against the duller finches . Even the red of the male house finches was no match for this sunburst . Then Triller , still on the edge of the flock , spread his wings a bit and strutted . " Well , Ell be , " I said . " Of course all finches are notoriously lascivious . " " What did you say ? " Harry asked . We had both stopped dead . " Sexy , " I said . " Finches  --  something all the poets have noted . " Triller was interested in a female house finch . Female house finches do not stimulate me . They are small brownish birds , their breasts streaked and spotted . The male house finch , on the other hand , is quite attractive , with reddish tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house finch . She flew to the top of the three-rail fence across the front of our lot . Trifler followed . He perched near her and edged up . " He 's pretty enterprising for a cage-bird , " I said . " My mother-in-law said he was a cross from some sort of foreign bird , " Harry said , looking at Triller with annoyance and almost distaste . " That explains the intense color and the black slash , " I said . " What do you suppose a mixture of that with the red of the house finch would give ? " " Well , I would n't know , " Harry said indifferently . The finch seemed to lose interest and rejoined the flock . Triller followed . He made an imitative stah or two at the ground with his hill , and I thought I saw him cat something . Then the flock took olf on its usual ragged ( Ugh into the GO BIRD-WATCHER vacant lot across the street , where a pair of nesting California jays greeted them with angry calls and flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house finch paused on the fence , and Triller joined her , singing a few notes and sidling up again . Then the finch flew off after the dock . Triller teetered on the fence . To my disappointment , he left the Fence , not for the flock , but for the tree in our patio , flying over the house and landing on his first perch . " I guess I 'll set out the cage , " Harry said , and each of us went back to his own house . If Trifler could learn to fly , if Triller could learn to be a ground-grubbing finch , Trifler could learn a lot of other things . It was late in the season , and why the female house finch had n't mated I did n't know , but there it was . My daughters appeared spontaneously as children do . " What are you doing , Daddy ? " Jane asked . " Nothing much , " I said , as they followed me into the kitchen . I opened the bread drawer and got a crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " She 's out marketing for the Brownie picnic tomorrow , " Martha said . " I remember now , " I said . " Why do n't you go over and see if Phyllis and Irene would n't like to play with you  --  and in their yard ? " " Their yard ? " Jane asked . " Yes , I thought you liked their new swing set , " I said . " We do , " Martha said and they went out . A minute later I followed with a casual saunter . Harry had come out of his house with the cage . Trifler was still in the patio walnut tree . Crumbling the crust in my right hand , I walked to the shrubs farthest away from the Bauers ' lot and let a trickle of crumbs fall near where the finches had gleaned . Then I went along that side of our lot , around the house and into the patio , letting the crumbs drop from my hand held straight down . I strolled over to the other side of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the cage , putting in a new cuttlebone and a fresh piece of lettuce . The four girls were making a most satisfactory racket . Harry caught sight of me and walked over to the fence . The way things stood , Harry and I were between Triller and his cage . The girls were beyond it but fairly close . Harry and I exchanged a few remarks on birds generally , and I must have shown too much interest . " Say , " he said , " I thought youwere an English professor . How come all the bird lore ? " " Oh , I just keep my eyes open , " I said a little defensively . It is considered a good and wise thing in my profession to know what birds Chaucer wrote about , but beyond that  --  well , one must be discreet . " You 're a regular bird-lover , " Harry said . " No , nol " I exclaimed . " I 'm a bird-watcher . " " There 's a difference ? " " There is , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird-watcher just watches them . He simply observes . He lets Nature 's pattern proceed and enjoys watching it being worked out , " My voice had taken on its worst classroom tones . I tried to relax it . " You know , there 's a pair of nesting California jays in that vacant lot . I do n't mean that they would go after a bird Trifler 's size , but they do eat the eggs of other birds and sometimes nestlings . " " Well , if they wo n't go after Triller , it does n't make any difference . " " Last year a pair of green-backed goldfinches nested in one of the oleanders out front there , " I went on . " After the eggs hatched the jays discovered them and ate the nestlings . " " How do you know ? " Harry asked . " I watched them , " I said . " Why the hell did n't you chase them off ? " " Ah , " I said , " that 's the remark of a bird-lover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right to its natural food ? " I had gone too far . Harry backed off , not wanting to talk with a cold-blooded bird-watcher . M ARY drove in just then , and I could see Betty Bauer talking to Harry out on their front lawn . Triller came down from the walnut , landed close to the shrubs in the front , and pecked at something . Then he pecked again . I followed Mary into the house and to the kitchen . Taking down a saucer I filled it with water and started out to the patio . " What in the world are you doing ? " Mary asked . " I 'll be back in a minute , " I called . I could see the girls now in the Bauers ' backyard . They made a delightful sight in their light dresses as they whirled and danced and giggled and shrieked . Mary came out . " What are you doing ? " she demanded . " Well , the Bauers have lost Triller , their canary , " I said , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell them to leave the cage outside with the door open , " Mary said . " And if you 're putting out water , put it by the cage . " " Is that true about the cage ? " I asked . " Everyone always says that . Anyway , take the water over there . " " Oh , they have water in the cage , " I said . Mary stared at me . " Are you up to something , Jack ? " " I do n't know , " I said , " but Triller is part wild and he seemed to be making out with a female house finch . " Mary continued to look at me . Then she said , " Well , call the girls in . " " They 're enjoying themselves . Let 's give them a few more minutes . " For a moment I thought Mary was going to say something else , but then she shrugged and went back into the house . I retreated to the inner edge of the patio . Suddenly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of song Triller came back to the walnut tree . He swooped down to the saucer and drank . Then up again in the lading light to the top of the tree with another musical phrase and then a chirp or two and then silence . I strolled over to the fence and called the girls home . I suppose it was the fact that my imagination had begun to work on the chances of what might happen if Triller and the house finch paired that made me call George Crowell after dinner . The girls were looking at television and Mary was in the kitchen . I went into my study and after I had looked up George 's number I dialed it . George is an ornithologist and we 've been on a couple of committees together . I did n't know if he was at house or off studying the Texas nighthawk , which is his current project . But he answered , and , feeling embarrassed at having called him , I said , " Say , George , this is Jack Thomas . I know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the chances are of a cross-bred male canary going wild and mating with a local finch ? " " Did you say this is Jack Thomas ? ' George asked . " I did . " Then I told him briefly about Trillcr and mentioned the house finch . " Of course all finches are sexy as hell , you know , " he said , " so I suppose they might actually breed . But ninety-nine chances out of a hundred the clutch , if there were a clutch , would be sterile . It 's an interesting idea , but you 're just dreaming . " " I suppose so , " I said . One chance in a hundred was still something . " And it 's terribly late in the season , " George went on . " The canary seems to be pretty randy , " I said , and thought of the hot late August in the valley . " You know , Jack , " George said , " I never dreamed you were a bird-lover . " " I 'm not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sure you know the difference . " " That 's what they all say , " he said , laughing . " But you might tell your man that if he wants his canary back he 'd better put the cage out with the door open . " " Is that really true ? " I asked . " Oh , it 's one of those things you always hear , " George said . " I see you 're a true man of science , " I said . When I hung up I saw Mary standing in the doorway . " Well ? " she said . " Should n't the girls be going to bed ? " I asked . " They 're going , " she said , settling herself in the leather chair by my desk . " Now just what is all this ? " " I ca n't help thinking about Triller and that finch , " I said . " Just imagine a whole new breed of bird growing up here in the west end of the valley  --  aristocratic like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And think of what it would do to the scientists . " I chuckled . " Well , what would it do ? " Mary asked . " They would n't believe it at first , " I said . " And then they would have to revise all their texts and lists and classifications and all that . And , anyway , Mary , just think , what fun to have a new breed ! " " Well , I do n't know , " she said , getting up and going over to a window . " It takes longer and 62 BIRD-WATCHER longer each evening for the air to cool this ugust . " " So it does , " I said , thinking of Trifler in the walnut tree and the finch sheltering with the flock . If only the heat would hold , I thought , as we went to bed . M OS T of the time I can take or leave my daughters ' Brownie Scout troops , but the whole notion of Brownie Scouting seemed an admirable one the next morning , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girls and Mary , who was a co-leader of one troop , would be gone from early morning until evening . I had got up surprisingly early for a Sunday . In fact , I had got up at the first bird-note , though it turned out not to be Triller 's . But about fifteen minutes later he did stir himself , let out a chirp , and came down to the saucer of water . The day was already heating up . Triller flew over the house . I went around and saw that he was eating under the oleanders . Looking over toward the Batters ' I could see the cage still out , the lettuce wilted . Triller flew hack to the patio walnut and tried a few notes . By the time Mary and the girls were ready to leave the day was steaming . " I 'll bet you wish you could come to the beach with us , " Martha said . " Oh , I 'll manage , " I said , and waved as long as I could see the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cage . I went over to the fence . " I saw Triller in one of my trees this morning , " I said . Harry shook his head . " What my mother-in-law will say I do n't like to think . " " I 've got to do my chores , " 1 said . " Maybe Triller will get hungry soon and come home . " " If he does n't , I just do n't know , " Harry said , shaking his head again . I went to my garage and got out the power mower . I 'm not a particularly good mechanic , and Harry has often remarked that my mower must be out of adjustment . It is , in fact , a mower that can take a lot of tinkering , and that morning it got off to any number of false roaring starts . I mowed slowly . I mowed so slowly and carefully that I still had a good half of the lawn to do by ten o'clock . The finches were on schedule . I shut off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perched in one of the front walnuts . Then he began to sing , a lyric , passionate song . How Harry Bauer , hearing it , could want Triller back in his cage , I could n't understand . A female finch  --  the female  --  hopped to the top bar of the fence . Triller came down in a flashing arc and landed about a foot from her . Shc fluttered to the side and Triller came after her . Then the finch was down with the rest of the flock and ' Tiller was too . One of the English sparrows took a peck at him and Triller hopped up and back , surprised . Then he struck back hard , the English sparrow chirred angrily , and the two birds whirled up three feet into the air . Triller outweighed the sparrow and got in another good peck , and the sparrow flew off to the edge of the flock . Triller was right beside the finch now . The leaders of the flock took off for the vacant lot . The jays screamed . The stragglers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finch were left , but then she flew to the fence , hesitated , and went after the flock . I pulled the starting cord of the mower with a steady strong pull . The motor roared up , I put the mower into gear , and I headed for the fence . Triller took off for the vacant lot like a black and yellow rocket . For the next five or ten minutes 1 mowed carefully across the front of the lot , keeping an eye on the finches . There were more seeds in the vacant lot than in our yard and the flock worked slowly through it , in spite of the jays ' angry calls . Every now and then I caught a flash of deep yellow . After the flock had disappeared and I had seen that wonderful touch of brilliance going with it , I mowed on , more quickly now , and finished up in a hurry . I would have finished sooner if I had n't had to stop from time to time for the bits of gravel Harry had heaved all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I put on a pair of walking shorts and a T-shirt . I felt fine . I stayed indoors during the hottest hours of the day , most of the time just whistling softly to myself and wondering how things were going with Triller , The whole valley was quiet , sodden with heat . By three o'clock or a little after , the walnut tree in the patio was casting a good thick shadow on the flagstones . I mixed myself a Scotch-andsoda and went outside to one of the long chairs . I was just finishing my drink and wondering if it were too early to mix another when I heard the crunch of tires on the driveway . I walked around the house and saw George Crowell getting out of his car . " This is a pleasant surprise , " I said . " I was driving out this way , " George said , far too casually , " and I thought I 'd just stop by and see if that canary had given up . " " Come on around to the patio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " l 'm having Scotch-and-soda . What 's for you ? " " If you 've got any ginger ale I 'll have bourbon and ginger ale , " he said . " Oh , " I said , trying to remember that he really ! vas a first-class ornithologist . We did have a bottle of ginger ale , since the girls sometimes drink it , and after I had mixed his drink I led George to the patio . We stretched out in long chairs and I filled him in on what had happened since my phone call . " That 's really interesting , " George said " Of course , as I told you , even if anything happens the eggs are bound to be sterile . " Then he laughed . " I never would have taken you for a bird-lover . " " Bird-watcher , " I said , and I told him about the jays and the green-backed goldfinches . He looked even more horrified than Harry had . He had just started to say something when I heard the finches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . I led him around the house and we stood beside it watching the . flock under the shrubs . Triller 's rich black and yellow blazed out in the shadow of the oleanders and pyracanthas . He was pecking up seeds and grubs and not just crumbs now , " Interesting , very interesting , " George said . " Interesting ! " I said brusquely . " It 's terrific ? " From the corner of my eye I could see Harry Bauer standing by the fence . When the finches began to take off for the vacant lot I was terribly let down to have Triller start repeating his morn'ng 's performance . " The fool ! " I said . Trifler paused on the fence , singing . ' Then he flew hack to the top of the oatio walnut and kept on singing . " The fool ! " 1 said again when we were back in our chairs . " You 're taking it pretty hard for a bird-watcher , " George said , grinning stupidly . " I really thought he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my drink . " If it 'll make you feel any better , look near the end of the fourth branch down from the top , " George said , still grinning like an idiot . For a moment I did n't understand . Then I looked up and saw against the green of the walnut leaves the drab little figure of the house finch . She chirped , and Trifler , stopping his singing , came down beside her . I went into the house and mixed a new round and then we went back to the patio and drank to Trifler . At least I did , for George , whose limitations I was learning , did n't seem to grasp the importance of the whole thing . He kept giving me a lot of rather dull information about the Texas nighthawk , most of which I did n't take in . I watched Trifler and the finch and thought of the future . It was something of a relief when George got up to go . Harry was still out in his yard and I walked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Triller really seems to be going wild , " I said . " I suppose you might as well take the cage in . " " I guess Cl/ leave it awhile , " he said . " It does n't cost anything . " When Mary and the girls got home that night , sunburned and sandy , they were so full of their own clay that it was a long time before I could say anything about Triller and the finch . S INCE , as Harry said . it did n't cost anything to leave the cage out , he left it there for three more days . By that time I had stopped worrying . Triller and the house finch were getting ready to build a nest , and what pleased me most was that they settled under the eaves of the side of our house away from the Batters ' . Once they had started , I realized there was n't much nest material around . We had an old kapok-stuffed pad from a long chair stored in the garage . The canvas had rotted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took a couple of handfuls of kapok and hung the stuff on the fence at that side of the house . Tril ler did n't grasp the possibilities , but the finch did , and before long they had built a neat nest IN COUPLE of days after this George Crowell came back , and I showed him the nest , the finch and Triller still fussing around it . " It does n't look quite like a house finch 's nest , " George said , squinting up at it . " What the devil is that stuff mixed in there , anyway ? " " It looks like kapok to me , " I said . " They must have found some lying around . " George was still full of the Texas nighthawk , though now that the nest was actually built he did begin to show more interest . " But I still say that even if she lays , the eggs will be sterile , " he insisted . Harry was n't home during week days , of course , but when I did see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he looked really worried when she showed up for a surprise visit . I was pretty sure there were eggs in the nest by now , and I decided I might as well have it out with Harry 's mother-in-law . As it turned out , Mrs. Palmer  --  as I discovered her name to be  --  was a fairly intelligent woman . She was far more interested in Trifler and the finch than any of the Bailers , and she and I exchanged a number of interesting observations on birds in general . Once Harry saw how the wind blew he cheered up , and from that time on the Bauer household really dropped out of Trifler 's story . But if Harry was out of it , George Crowell came more and more into it . Once we were sure there were eggs  --  we counted six when both birds were off the nest  --  George seemed to come by almost every other day and I had to lay in an extra supply of ginger ale , not to mention bourbon . Actually , George was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he left for the desert . He came by that afternoon , and from his intensity I could see he was thinking about the nighthawk . " I just stopped by this time to say I 'm going to the desert tomorrow , " he said . " I found I could break away and be gone until the new semester starts . " " Is n't it awfully late ? " I asked . " Well , 1 got to thinking about your birds , " he said . " And then the desert is still hot . With luck I could get some work clone . " " That 's fine , " I said . " Meanwhile I 'll keep track of Triller and the finch . " " That 's why I came by , " George said . " Come on out to the car . " We started down the drive . " I still say nothing can come of it , " George said , " but after all , I am an ornithologist and if anything does come through I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his car . He reached in by the front seat and lifted out an old Daisy air gun . " I had one of those when 1 was a kid , " I said , surprised . " I use this for collecting small specimens , " he said . " The thing carries a little to the left . At thirty feet you aim one foot to the right and you hit the target . You might practice a bit , though I know it 's useless . " " Practice for what ? " I asked . " The way I figure it , the eggs if they do hatch are due any day . Of course the birds themselves ? the birds that do n't exist , that is  --  will certainly be mules , but I 'd like to have two or three specimens : one when they leave the nest , one when they 're grown , and so on . The BB shot will probably kill them at that size , but if it just stuns a bird , put it in a box and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy and a small cloth bag of shot as if he were doing the most ordinary thing in the world . Carried back to my boyhood , I took the gun and held it barrel down . I did n't say anything . George turned back to his car . " I wo n't be back till the very end if I have any luck , and the first weeks of school arc so busy I may not make it out here for a while . " " Oh , " I said . George got into his car and backed out the driveway . Mary and the girls were surprised to see me coining toward the garage with the gun . I had n't had any kind of gun for years . " What are you going to shoot , Daddy ? " Jane shouted at me . " Nothing , " I said . " Nothing . " " What in the world ? " Mary asked . " One of George 's crazy ideas , " I said . " I 'm putting it in the garage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of the third day after George had left I thought I heard something from the ( Continued on page 67 ) nest . The finch moved about restlessly . Triller hopped along the top of the fence . In another hour I was sure and I went in to tell the family . Even they were excited by now . I " I WAS N'T long before Triller and the house finch began an endless round of journeys to and from the nest . A few clays later the clamor the nestlings set up whenever one of the parent birds returned to the nest was really something . A couple of days later still I was sitting in the patio , half aware of the birds ' chatter . I was still indignant over the Daisy air gun . Given the one chance in a hundred , and the other chance that the birds might not be mules , and all the other odds against surviving and crossing  --  well , if George Crowell thought I was going to use that gun , he was nothing but a mad scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , peopling the whole west end of the valley with my new breed of brilliant and lively and lusty little birds when I slowly became aware of a new sound . It took me a few moments to wake up to the racket and then I realized that I was hearing not only the calls of Triller and the finch but also the low annoyed croak of another bird . I jumped up from the chair and ran to the side of the house . Perched on the roof were the two adult jays , and ranged along the fence were their three half-grown offspring , squawking hungrily . Triller and the finch were diving at the two giant birds , but they could n't hope to hold them off for long . I grabbed up a handful of grass and flung it at the jays , shouting at the sametime . The jays hopped back . I grabbed a clod of dirt from beside the fence post nearest me and let fly with it . The jays retreated farther and the younger ones flapped away to the front lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage and lifted down the Daisy and the sack of BBs. loaded the gun as I ran back . One of the great jays was just going in under the eaves and Triller and the house finch were diving and shrieking . I tried to measure thirty feet with my eye . I raised the Daisy and aimed a foot to the right of the jay . Then , back in my boyhood , I carefully squeezed the trigger . The hollow ping of the air gun startled me , but I had guessed right . The jay came down , stunned but still flapping . I ran to it , snatched it up , and broke its neck . The other jay screamed from the fence , confused and angry . Once again I measured thirty feet , aimed a foot to the right , and squeezed . This one I got through the eye and it fell , fluttering slowly , drawing up its legs as it stopped quivering . The young jays were flying back to the vacant lot and I let them alone , knowing they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the two dead jays and carried them toward the garage . Mary and the girls had run out of the house and I could see the Bauer girls and Betty Bauer in their yard looking at me . But I was n't finished . George would be coming back some day and I was n't taking any chances . I went to my tool chest and got out a cold chisel and a hammer . As I have said , I 'm not particularly me chanical , but almost anyone can wreck an old air gun . JOHN V.

For such , the wise wayfarer knows , Were all that ought to be expected ; The safer that he lay no claim beyond His right to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape of things in store ; And is himself well served who has required The way and nothing more .
