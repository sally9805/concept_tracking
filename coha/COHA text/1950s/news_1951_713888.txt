txt Letters to The Times Task in Korea Extent of Destruction Described in Urging U. N. Aid The writer of the following letter is president of the Korean Affairs Institute . To THE EDITOR OF THE /slaw YORK TIMES : Discussing the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Korea today  --  with the destruction continuing unabated ? may seem like putting the cart before the horse . Obidously nothing can be accomplished until the shooting stops . However , responsible officials at Washington , at the United Nations and in other capitals are giving serious attention ? to the problem of restoring Korea as a useful , productive member of the family of nations . That is welcome news . Nevertheless , there is an air of unreality to these rehabilitation projects that must be reconsidered . While the eventual resurrection of the Korean nation is the duty of the whole world , it must be primarily a U. N. task . No other organization can assume the responsibility for a project of such importance and scope . The nation lies in ruins . Literally millions of its people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of thirty million is destitute . Health and morale will suffer for generations . On May 21 J. Donald Kingsley , agent general of the U. N. Korean Reconstruction Agency , said : " I doubt that ever in the history of the world , since perhaps the sacking of Carthage , has there been such complete destruction as has occurred in Korea . " Need for Aid Koreans would be happy and proud if they could rebuild their country without outside help , but they simply do not have the means . If Korea remains a rubble heap , with its people engulfed in misery long after the hostilities end , the war will have been fought in vain . In order to restore faith in man and confidence in the United Nations , Korea must be completely rehabilitated in the shortest possible time . A lagging reconstruction program will cost more innocent lives and leave a deep scar on civilized consciences . Unfortunately , the statements of some high officials are discouraging not only to Korea but perhaps to other peace-loving nations as well . There seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation and to shift the responsibility for coping with it . At Wake Island General told President Truman : " I do not believe that you can absorb and spend in Korea much more than $150,000,000 a year . I believe three years of that will place Korea on its feet and not only make Korea self-sustaining but give it a higher living standard . I believe that half a billion dollars spread over three to five years will more than make up the destruction . " U. N. Budget Thus far the U. N. has budgeted $250,000,000 for its first year 's rehabilitation and reconstruction program for Korea . On March 1 Agent-General Kingsley warned : " South Koreans are enthusiastic about Americans , but unfortunately they think their country will be turned into a Hollywood version of New York when the war is over . This illusion is potentially dangerous ! " Deputy Agent-General of U. N. Korean Reconstruction Agency Sir Arthur Rucker said in Korea May 8 that he realized fully the magnitude of the reconstruction job in Korea , but " I know that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. N. K. R. A. will help to the fullest extent that its resources permit . " . One needs no higher mathematics to figure out how far General 's $150,000,000 or . the U. N. $250,000,000 will go . A common-sense analysis might prove beneficial . In 1947 the United States Army of Occupation imported $77,574,238 worth of foodstuffs to supplement the rationing for " nonproducers " ( of food ) in Southern Korea alone . It also imported agricultural supplies amounting to $31,393,780 during the same year . And at that time crops were fair and farming undisturbed . Today the situation has entirely changed . Many Koreans have lost their homes , shops , factories , tools , ? equipment , furniture and clothing . Their farms are wrecked and their draft animals are gone . Virtually every Korean is a pauper . Destitution of Population Aside from the other necessities of life , bare minimum food needs alone can safely be estimated at threefold the 1947 imports . Fivefold might not be an overly generous estimate . What will be the cost of such imports in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live on bread alone . They desperately need shelter and clothing , not to mention such things as shoes , medicine and.school books . Many have already died of exposure as well as starvation . Not only do the Korean people dislike the idea of perpetual charity , ? but the United Nations can not stand having a permanent beggar nation around its neck . Koreans are not asking for charity . The United Nations , for the sake of its own integrity and prestige , should assume full responsibility for the complete revitalization of the decimated country . It can not afford to take halfhearted measures . After Korea has sacrificed so much in this war it would be little enough and only fair to expect necessary material and technical skill from the United Nations . As for Korea , she can furnish the labor . If the nations of the world under the United Nations ' . leadership would pull together for this noble purpose , Korea could be rebuilt from its scorched earth and the people who are suffering from this unspeakable tragedy might have a new lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important stride toward long-desired international cooperation , ending of the armsecompetition , the saving of civilization and the reviving of the morals of mankind . Only then could the United Nations stand on a firm foundation , commanding the respect of the 1 whole world . YONGJEuNG KIM . Washington , June 4 , 1951 . To Promote Savings Incentive of Tax Reduction to Purchasers of Bonds Proposed The writer of the following letter is Assistant Professor of Economics at Denison University . To THE EDITOR Or THE NEW YORK TIMES : Business leaders and professional economists are becoming increasingly perturbed by the present inflationary trends . The consensus of opinion among economists is that the effective way to combat inflation is to adopt drastic tax programs along with new and improved patterns ' of money and debt management ; that the maximum contribution of an effective direct price control program is an indefinite restraint of inflationary pressures ; and that there is little possibility of implementing an effective price control program under the present or a similar cold war environment . Thus , the need for a substitute for direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings programs . If such programs , were efficiently implemented the objective of constraining excess purchasing power indefinitely would be secured . Unfortunately many of the same complexities which exist under direct price controls also exist under compulsory savings programs , and equally cumbersome administrative machinery would develop under the latter as well as under the former program . Tax Reduction The incentive used to entice the consumer-taxpayer to save substantially is the reward of a slightly reduced tax schedule for persons saving a stipulated amount out of their current income in comparison to the tax schedule applied to those persons who choose not to save . The bonds purchased under this plan would be non-negotiable , but might be of two varieties of redemption . One type would be redeemable only upon the discretion of the Treasury for the first five years , and by stipulated amounts according ' to serial number in succeeding years . For example , 10 per cent of the bonds outstanding could be redeemed each year following the first five years , provided that there were 3,000,000 unemployed or less . For every , million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 per cent until all of the series were redeemed . Interest Rates These bonds would bear 3 or 4 per cent interest to stimulate purchases by persons whose liquidity preference is high . The second type for persons with extreme liquidity preference would be redeemable after eighteen months , but would pay only 1 per cent interest . The low administrative cost and the voluntary aspect make this type of program more desirable than high-cost , compulsory programs . Furthermore , with such an alternative available , Congress might be more willing to raise the rates for nonparticipants to a level more appropriate for fighting inflation . As the tax rates became more drastic the more attractive would such a savings program become . To be consistent with a broad antiinflationary program , the tax rates for nonparticipants should be sufficiently high to guarantee a budgetary surplus should the majority of taxpayers turn out to be nonparticipants . However , the tax rate for participant savers should also be high enough to approximate a balanced budget should a large number of taxpayers become participant savers . This program is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated above . But if programs geared to constraining rather than curing inflation are in order , here is one possibility with long-term feasibility and a minimum of administrative complexities . PAUL E. NELSON . Granville , Ohio , May 31 , 1951 . Value of Military Training To THE EDITOR OF THE NEw YORK TIMES ; Congratulations on your editorial of May 28 " No Magic Formula . " I do not get this deferment idea at all . What are these young men afraid of ? It is all too true that when a nation like ours goes into an all-out war , and puts millions of men under arms , we are bound to have an average percentage of delinquents , mental deficients , etc. , but I have yet to see a man who has not come out of ? military training a better citizen and a better man . This applies to the foot-slogging infantry and will apply to the " deferees " as well . The young " intellectuals " should bear in mind that the armed services need doctors , lawyers and engineers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I speak from experience , having served in uniform six years overseas in the two World Wars . My son put in four years as a fighter pilot . It has not hurt our professional careers one bit . For we , like Cincinnatus , return to our plows when the smoke blows away . LESTER S. THOmPsON . " Copenhagen , Denmark , June 1 , 1951 . Governing Liberia Suppression by Regime Charged of Supporters of Democracy The writer of the following letter , Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at The City College , and adviser on trusteeship to the United States delegation at the first session of the General Assembly , is President of the Institute of Ethnic Affairs , Inc . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : THE NEw YORK TIMES dispatch from its special correspondent in Liberia , published June 2 , partly unveils a situation of desperate danger to the men in Liberia who seek the democratic way , and a violation of human rights which concerns all of Africa and must concern Americans . The one-party regime in Liberia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overwhelming aboriginal majority , is striking a death blow at the opposition party . At the Liberian election May 1 this opposition , or Reformation , party would have swept the field , bringing the 1,600,000 native Liberians into control of their Government for the first time . Exclusion From Ballot The President Tubman " True Whig party " regime , invoking a valid or invalid procedural technicality , excluded the Reformation party from the ballot and the election . Dihdwo Twe , the majority Presidential candidate , had sought informally , without success , to have the United Nations or our State Department send observers , whose presence might prevent or mitigate the stealing of the election . On this stated ground the Tubman regime immediately after the election sent its police to arrest Mr. Twe . Today either Mr. Twe is being held secretly in jail or is still being pursued and an unstated number of his associates are actually jailed , according to THE TIMES dispatch . The plain object is to terrorize anew the aborigines of Liberia and to destroy outright their leadership . Mr. Twe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgical operation , returned to Liberia two months ago , having been nominated by the aborigines as their candidate in November of last year . Twe knew , and publicized in Liberia , that witch doctors had been imported from the Gold Coast to poison him . He knew that if jailed , away from his faithful entourage and from his personal cook , he must go on a hunger strike and die , or else risk slow death through poisoned food . He knew that probably he would be jailed . Twe has been called the Gandhi of Liberia and is like Gandhi in his universal charity and his indifference to personal fate . , This statement is not hearsay . One-Party Rule Like numerous other Americans , 1 know Mr. Twe well , and he spent with me his last day before flying to Liberia two months ago . What is happening in Liberia today a repetition of what has happened for eighty years , as set forth in an authoritative book by Raymond Leslie Buell of the Foreign Policy Association in 1947 . United States quasi-guardianship has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations , but rather has led it to repeated actions of brazen cynicism and audacity . But the Africa of today is not the Africa of eighty or even ten years ago . All of West Tropical Africa , except only Liberia , now receives genuine and increasing social services and marches toward self-rule or toward incorporation in the citizenship of metropolitan European nations . The Liberian outrage will irradiate through much of " native " Africa and will create cynicism about America and about democratic constitutional forms which , in Liberia , are used as a sanction of corrupt tyranny . And as for Mr. Twe ? he is no sudden insurgent into Liberia . He has been known as a man of true greatness across more than forty years . Educated in the United States , he made our deepest values his own ; his consecration to the democratic life way is cornplete and he is a devout and practicing Christian . For such a man to be leader of a great mass movement in West Africa means much to the hope of a free world . For him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for the hope of the free world . Charges Substantiated In 1929 , as a member of the Liberian House of Representatives , Mr. Twe exposed the human ' slavery being practiced in Liberia . In two days he was thrown out of the Legislature by the ruling machine , and to save his life he escaped to Sierra Leone , under British protection , for two years . Meantime the League of Nations through a commis ? sion investigated his slavery charges on the ground and substantiated them . Today the need is for action of another kind . The United States , without intervening in Liberia any more than it has done for a century , could and the present outrage and insure a Ina ohoUm . We must so intervene , or we will stand as silent partners tithe Ming of democracy  --  our kind of deolocraer-le in that place in Africa when ours la the predominant responsibility .
