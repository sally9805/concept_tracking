txt Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower announced personally today that he would make before Election Day a disclosure of his financial returns for the last ten years . The Re= publican Presidential nominee 's ' statement came after some newspapers had published details of an off-the-record news conference held by him last Sunday in which he said he had no intention of making his tax returns public . " Why .. should I dance . to - someone else 's tune ? " lie asked reporters when they sought information as to when he intended to follow the lead of Gov . Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois , the Democratic Presidential nominee , who already has released publicly his individual tax returns for the last decade . He was reminded at the off-the-record meeting that James C. Hagerty , his press secretary , had said six days earlier that his financial returns were being collected and that he was sure the- candidate would make a statement in view ot the public interest in the question . But on Sunday General Eisenhower responded that he did not care what Mr. Hagerty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the financial data public because he had not found any particular public interest in his own finances , inasmuch as he had never had a political fund . But when the story of the Sun- day conference was published today , General Eisenhower met with some of his advisers and decided to make a public statement on his own finances . The first announcement of his new intentions came from Gov . Sherman Adams of New Hampshire , his personal political chief of staff , whesaid that the financial records had not been collected as yet , but that when they ? were ready , anyone . who was interested , including repor , ters , could see them . He did not indicate when this might be . ? Direct Answer . Requested After this statement , however , reporters pointed out that there was no statement that this accounting would be madebefore the election and also that die statement . came from Governer Adams and not from General Eisenhower himself . They pointed out that General Eisenhower already had said he was not bound by a prior ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he specifically had declared in Los Angeles last night that he Aid not , have " a ghostly spokesman " and that he would speak for himself whenever he had anything to'say . On behalf of the reporters , as a group , Mr. Hagerty then put up to the nominee this question : " May we please have an answer directly from you to the question whether you intend =to make public before election time your income tax returns or a financial statement giving substantially the same information ? " General Eisenhower gave this answer to Mr. Hagerty : " Of course . If anyone , is interested they can have the , - report as , soon as it is completed . It is virtually all a matter of public record anyway . " It was General Eisenhowei 's view at the off-the-record session that the Democrats were interested primarily in getting his tax returns so as to revive a controversy over the amount of taxes he had paid on the several hundred thousand dollars he had received for writing his war memoirs , " Crusade in Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any special favors from the Internal Revenue Bureau when this literary property had been classed as a capital gains transaction  --  on the ground that he was not a professional writer  --  and the tax was computed at a 25 per cent rate instead of the much higher rates that would have applied if the transaction had been considered as ordinary personal income . He said the Democrats were trying to give new publicity to something that had been published long ago . But General Eisenhower 's decision today to make his financial position public raised anew the question of whether his running mate , Senator Richard M. Nixon of California , would follow suit . Senator Nixon already has been under considerable political fire for having a privately contributed $18,235 personal political expense account which he discussed in a nation-wide television broadcast when there nad been talk of dropping him from the Republican ticket . ' Speaks in Three States Senator John J. Sparkman of Alabama , the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee , followed the lead of Governor Stevenson and also made his tax returns available to reporters . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax returns public . " I do n't work for Senator Nixon , " was his reply . This new development in the battle of the income ' tax returns came as General Eisenhower campaigned across Arizona , New Mexico and Utah in a bid for the three-state total of twelve electoral votes , which went Denioratio in 1948 . Four years ago , the Democrats polled 56 per cent of Arizona 's vote , 57 per cent of the New Mexico vote , and 55 per cent of the ' Utah vote . , Tonight , in a major prepared speech in the Mormon Tabernacle at Salt Lake City , General Eisen : hower returned to the theme of a " middle way " approach to Americe 's domestic and foreign problems . This was the main line he took in his first frankly political speech of the campaign at Boise , Idaho , in mid-August . Declaring that there is " a better road than the extreme right of the extreme left , " the Republican nominee said that he knew the " extremes probably offer a more alluring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should not apply the extremes when dealing with'the problems of labor , of foreign policy , of routing out subversives in Government and other major policy problems that Will confront the next administration . Dealing with the problem of routing out Communist subversion , General Eisenhower said that there was one extreme " that takes no account of our civil liberties " and " wounds the ; innocent as well as the guilty . " He said the Other extreme was " no less repugnant to me " because it treated " with a light touch the whole ugly record of Communist infiltration and subversion . " He then turned to the problem of labor and said that " radicals hail American workers as their neglected brothers  --  and hope to climb to political power on their backs . " On the other hand he said that " reactionary extremists attack American unions as unnecessary or greedy  --  and hope to climb to wealth on their broken backs . " Backs Voluntary Arbitration " In the matter of labor disputes , I stand for the simple , too long neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stand by my conviction that labor problems need not and should not be exploited by employers for economic gain or by politicians for political gain . I am deeply suspicious of compulsion by any side  --  by union leaders , by employers , or by a government . Especially I distrust a government whose only remedy for strikes is seizure and whose chief concern for labor is its votes . " He said that in the field of foreign policy he also proposed a " broad middle way . " He said that there were some who would " bluster in words " and that this might lead to national humiliation . There were others , he said , who would offer only " meek appeasement . " The way , to true national security , he said , " is something different from either extreme : quiet firmness in words , effective strength in purpose- , in productivity , and in ' arms . " " The specific problem of arm . int , our nation presents a particularly clear problem in finding and adhering to the middle way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view would have us arm with hysterical speed  --  leading to an unmanageable financial prob . lem . " The opposite extreme is no less dangerous : Its obsession with economy is so fierce that it would simply convert us into a rich and defenseless prize for the bold aggressor ? Real security demands both military strength and soweney . It involves complex logistics but it also involves simple mathe ? matics . " General Eisenhower spoke to a capacity audience of more than 8,000 persons in the Mormon Tab . ernacle . His Democratic . opponent , Gov . Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois , speaks in the same hall next Tues. day night . He called for the re-election of Gov . J. Bracken Lee and of Senator Arthur V. Watkins of Utah a8 important members of his causada team . Senator Watkins generally is regarded as an isolationist in Washington . ?

At his two Arizona stops , Gen. eral Eisenhower drew crowds ol about 12,000 at Montgomery Stad ? ium in Phoenix and a crowd of about 4,000 at the Tucson Airport . It was a hot sunny day , ideal for campaigning . In both speeches , the Republican nominee continued to reply to at . tacks made upon the Republicans by President Truman and his as ? sertion that no more multiple pur. pose dams would be built in the West if the Republicans were re ? turned to national ? power .. " , The General promised more reclainatioa projects if he was eleeted%and pledged again a greater ifiefisure of local control . He defined the central purpose of his crusade as " be to substi. tute good government for the American people in place of bad government .

General Eisenhower also praised Mn Goldwater , recalling they had been together " in another crusade , 4 a reference to the war in Europe .

" The nominee told this story : " What do you want me to do in this war , Ike ? " asked Pat . " Go out to Australia and gel some supplies into the Philips pines , " I said . " When ? " asked Pat . " Now , " I replied . And General Hurley took on the job of trying to get supplies to American forces still fighting on Bataan . General Eisenhower called for the election of Mr. Hurley , who is running for the Senate seat now held by Senator Dennis Chavez , and for the re-election of Governor Mechem . In his Salt Lake City speech , General Eisenhower also criticized the Administration severely for its approach to the current political campaign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name-call ? ing and a variety of assorted non ? sense " instead of discussing the is. sues . " I have not replied in kind , " he said : " I do not intend to do so . " " I do not intend to appeal to prejudice , to fear , to self-interest . To do that would be to lose more than an election . I have appealed to the devotion to country , to the good sense , the sound conviction , the capacity ' of American citizens to face facts . I intend to go right on . No. other " appear is. worthy of America . Only such an appeal could make victory useful in the service of America . "
