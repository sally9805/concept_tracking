txt Boston will have an $86 tax rate in 1957 unless Mayor Hynes takes up the slack on the city 's purse strings , the Boston Municipal Re0 .. arch Bureau warned today . Last year 's rate was $78.70 . Taking direct issue with the Mayor 's annual message in which he said any economies would involve " drastic measures " which would have a " debilitating effect upon our city , " the bureau cited specific areas in which reasonable savings could be made . Mayor Hynes based his hope for tax relief on the state , mainly through the adoption of a proposed sales tax . The bureau pointed out that any tax-relief program to be enacted by the Legislature probably would come too late to help in this year 's rate . Sure Way Indicated " Reductions in maintenance allowance are the only sure way of keeping the tax rate from going up again , " the bureau said . " Too many hopes for Boston 's future depend upon holding the tax-rate line . Boston 's urban renewal program can not go forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new development hangs upon a competitive tax climate . Boston 's ability to stimulate modernization and reconstruction of existing properties depend upon competitive tax climate , " the bureau added . In the past 10 years Boston 's rate has increased by 87 per cent . The bureau points out that many factors involved in the rate are beyond the control of the administration . At the sane time , however , the factors over which the Mayor has final say are considerable . First , the bureau says the administration has ignored its frequently announced no-hire , no-fire policy . Expert Opinion Given During 1954 and 1955 , a private consulting firm was hired to make staffing studies , spelling out in detail the number of employees needed in the welfare , assessing , traffic , building , treasury , printing , and election departments . At present these departments have 138 more employees than the consulting firm recommended , or 10 per cent more than was deemed necessary . These recommendations should be put into effect and similar studies should be made of all other departments , the bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city departments were re organized and consolidated in an effort to save money . These hopes have not been fulfilled , it says . Allowances for temporary employees and overtime reached an all-time peak in 1956 . " Temporary employment and overtime are easily subject to abuse and require strict controls , " commented the bureau . Fund Backlo , , In addition , the report suggests to Mayor Hynes that budget requests for major repairs and equipment in 1957 should be held to a minimum . Boston is going into 1957 with a heavy backlog of funds , for improvements and equipment already authorized by appropriations and loans not expended that total about $19,000,000 . This will allow the city to carry out a sizeable program of improvements and major repairs and to buy large amounts of equipment during 1957 without dipping into the 1957 budget . One bright light for 1957 is a $2,530,209 windfall ? from the state for street improvements . Last year the Legislature included distribution of $15 , - 000,000 to cities and towns to be spent cn street construction and reconstruction for which municipalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These funds , plus available loan balances for streets , will permit Boston to suspend the usual loan authorization in 1957 with its accompanying down payment of $150,000 . Penalty for Borrowing While Boston can provide the necessary sums for streets through this method , the bureau ? showed in its report the penalty the city pays for borrowing money . Each year Boston borrows money in anticipation of taxes . This year it wants to borrow $100,000,000 . Interest on this will be about $2,000,000 , which is double the interest rate of last year . Other increases outside the Mayor 's control include the MTA ' deficit which will be an estimated $8,000,000 for Boston , or $1,000,000 more than last year . Metropolitan District Commission assessments also will be higher this year , but Boston turned over some of its facilities to the MDC which should balance that item . Increased prices for food and fuel also will add an estimated $500,000 to the budget . The total for increased expenditures or loss of revenue will be about $11,000,000 , for an $86 tax rate , other factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
