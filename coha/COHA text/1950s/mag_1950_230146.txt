Britain 's Labor Party went to the hustings in 1945 with an election program titled , " Let Us Face the Future . " Hopeful Britons swept Clement Attlee and the Laborites in with a 195-seat majority in Parliament . Last week , as Britain prepared for another general election , agile Laborite publicity men were right on hand with a new manifesto . The title this time : " Let Us Win Through Together . " One of the authors wryly admitted , " It 's a little long , but we needed to say all that . " <P> The manifesto , a twelve-page pamphlet , had a red &; white cover and a red &; white program inside . Doctrinaire Socialists were promised a little more nationalization : sugar , cement , cold storage facilities and water supply ( about a third of Britain 's water systems are still privately owned ) . But the emphasis was on welfare , not state ownership . The greater part of the manifesto talked pleasantly of full employment , child welfare , and the " full and free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously intended to catch the middle-class voters , who probably will decide the election . The Tory press , however , was not soothed by Labor restraint . " LAND TAKE-OVER FEARED " was the Daily Express ' interpretation of a Labor proposal for government cultivation of unused private land . To Lord Rother-mere 's Daily Mail , the Labor Party manifesto was " a blank check on nationalization " ; to his Evening News , it was a " pink overall , " a " pink pig in a poke " or " a great red wolf . " <P> At week 's end from Chartwell , his country home in Kent , Winston Churchill delivered the first major speech of the Conservative campaign . Just as Labor appealed to the middle class , so Churchill sought to win over the workers . He first offered his own definition of Socialism : " a mistaken political philosophy and largely obsolete mode of thought , leading to an all-powerful state which owns everything , which plans everything , which distributes everything . " Then he laid down a red &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scheme of society for which we stand is the establishment and maintenance of a basic standard of life and labor below which a man or woman , however old or weak , shall not be allowed to fall . The food they receive , the prices they have to pay for basic necessities , the homes they live in , their employment must be the first care of the state and must have priority over all other peacetime needs . Once we have made that standard secure , we propose to set the nation free as quickly as possible from the controls and restrictions which now beset our daily life . " <P> The voters would have to go behind the opening statements to find out where the Conservatives began and the Socialists left off .
