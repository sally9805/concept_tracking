In the luxurious rectangular box that is the Waldorf-Astoria 's Empire Room , a wellrounded , balding businessman in spectacles put a clarinet to his lips and once again became a famous living trademark . Behind him 13 instruments exploded in the old Goodman theme song Let 's Dance , and the guests at the Empire Room 's tables began to feel wonderful . A surprised young waiter nearly dropped the filet mignon Benny he was serving . " For this room-so loud ! " he whispered . <P> By the time Benny Goodman 's new band had worked its way through the first set , from Bugle Call Rag through Sing , Sing , Sing , everything in the Empire Room was just as Benny Goodman likes it . People seemed unaware that there was no more space on the dance floor : they just had to dance , and they did . <P> The King of Swing is playing for dancing once again , and he is bucking a trend he himself started 20 years ago when Benny and his free-swinging sidemen had youngsters clustering around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swing was the thing , and in 1938 Benny Goodman set an altitude record for jazzmen with his concert at Carnegie Hall . <P> But the end of World War II left Benny-and the other big jazz bands-far behind . The standard unit became the combo ( three to eight musicians ) and the music they played took off into outer space of cold , interstellar atonalities . Benny Goodman spent more and more time at his place in Connecticut , listening to his classical records . <P> Last week Benny seemed happier than he had been in a long time . Standout sidemen in Benny 's new band : Trombonist Urbie Green and Drummer Mousie Alexander , a graduate , surprisingly , of the contrapuntal Sauter-Finegan band . The arrangements were mostly the old Fletcher Henderson " killer-dillers " that Benny made famous in the ' 30s , and the swinging improvisations did not seem so improvised any more . But this exhibit from the past-venerable enough to have a movie made about his life-was still able to show a new generation that there is something besides Dixieland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - roll . " One of the worst things about this stuff they play nowadays , " said Benny , " is what it does to the musicians . I had an awful time trying to get some guys together who could really deliver music . A little while ago I went over to Birdland to see what was going on . I was standing there listening in bewilderment when I noticed this kid next to me , concentrating like hell . ' You really get something out of this ? ' I asked him . ' Well , ' he said , ' they 're looking for something . ' I had to laugh . ' You 're right , ' I told him . ' They have n't found it yet ! " :
