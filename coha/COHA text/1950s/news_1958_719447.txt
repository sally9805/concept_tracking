txt WASHINGTON , Jan. 14 ? The Air Force hopes to launch a military reconnaissance satellite with a recoverable capsule by the spring of 1959 . It plans " to put a test vehicle into orbit by next October , using the Thor* intermediate range ballistic missile as a booster . Authority to move into the final development stage of the hitherto-secret project was obtained " just several months ago , " according to Maj. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever , commander of the Air Fcrce Ballistic Missile Division . He gave the Senate Preparedness subcommittee the details ' at a closed hearing last Thursday . A heavily censored transcript of his testimony became , available , today . Led Corps in Korea Meanwhile , the Army announced that , Lieut . Gen. Arthur G. Trudeau would replace Lieut . Gen. James M. Gavin as chief of Research and Development when the latter retires ' March 31 . General Trudeau now commands the I Corps in Korea , General Trudeau , 55 years old , is former chief of Army intelligence . His post in Korea will be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander Of the Eighty-second Airborne Division . Presi- , dent Eisenhower has nominated ' General Trapnell for promotion to lieutenant general . General Gavin 's resignation came in connection with the current investigation of the nation 's defenses . He charged the ' Army was " deteriorating " and that he had . been " frustrated " in trying to get what he believed were necessary funds and ' essential improvements , Could Give Military Data ' The transcript of the space project , as declassified by the Pentagon , gave no information on the size or purpose of the detachable capsule that presumably would be shot back to earth from a reconnaissance satellite . However , according to informed speculation it is theoretically possible to equip such a compartment with photographic or infra-red equipment that could provide pictures or data of military value . For example , the recovered device might indicate the location of secret industrial concentrations or missile launching sites in the Soviet Union . Pentagon officials would not elaborate on General Schriever 's disclosure except to say that the Air Force had been working since 1946 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // said that the project was highly ' secret . General Schriever said that the reconnaissance satellite program went back to 1946 , when the Air Force retained the Rand Corporation , a private research concern , to study the feasibility of putting an earth satellite into orbit . The Rand Corporation " made specific recommendations to the Air Force about 1953 that the time had come to actually go into a systems program , " he testified . Putting development on a " systems " basis means to bring together for testing the various components such as the launching vehicle and the orbiting device . " We have just several months ago for the first time got suf. ficient funds to proceed on this , on a systems basis , " General ( Schriever said . " Prior to that ' we were working on a component basis . " While there was " a lot of interest at different sources in the Government for an advanced reconnaissance system , " he recalled , " we got no approval for proceeding with this on a systems basis either on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretarial level until just recently . " The approval apparently was ' given shortly before the first Soviet earth satellite was launched Oct. 4 . Since then , 1 " there has of course been a desire to accelerate this proIgram , " General Schriever testifed . As a consequence , he added , he gave verbal instructions . I Which " will be carried out in contractual terms , " to adopt the Thor , a 1,500-mile missile , as the launching device . " We think * ? * that we can get before the end of this year , say some time around perhaps as early as July , but more likely about October , we can get an orbiting vehicle with the Thor as a booster . which would be a. boost to this program here , " he said . " In other words , we would be getting experience , we would be getting some of the components in flight , and so forth . " He indicated that subsequent test satellites would use a second-stage engine as well as the Thor , He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time by the spring , and we have not firmed up on these dates yet , but I have given instructions to proceed with this program . " The rest of the passage was censored . The weight and size of the various test satellites and of the final reconnaissance vehicle were deleted , rom the declassified testimony . It is known , however , that the Air Force proposed to launch a half-ton satellite as part of the International Geophysical Year , which ends in 1858 , but was not permitted to participate in the program . At a closed session today , the Senate subcommittee heard Gen. Nathan ' P. Twining , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , advise against hasty action , to reorganize the Defense Department . Senator John Stennis , Democrat of Mississippi , who presided as vice chairman of the subcommittee , said that General Twinning had given an optimistic report on the cornparativa military strength of the United States and the Soviet Union . Today 's defense investigation activities at the Capitol included the appearance by Neil H. , Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Services Committee .
