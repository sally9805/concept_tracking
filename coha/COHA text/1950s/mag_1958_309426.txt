As East German Communist Boss Walter Ulbricht began a state visit to Poland last week , his special rolled into Warsaw 22 minutes late . " Polish sloppiness , " growled an outraged German Communist . No less sourly , many a citizen of Warsaw noted that the black-red-and-gold flags scattered throughout Warsaw in Ulbricht 's honor were the first German flags to fly over the city since Hitler 's occupation troops were driven out . <P> Awkward as all this was , State Visitor Ulbricht and his hosts did their dogged best to ignore the fact that even 13 years of joint servitude to Moscow has not wiped out the ancient hostility between Poles and Germans . Poland 's Wladyslaw Gomulka , bundled up against Warsaw 's icy wind , greeted Ulbricht with the promise that " we will do all in our power to strengthen the international position of the German Democratic Republic . ' ' In return , Walter Ulbricht declared that he brought with him " the indestructible friendship of the German people . " <P> Behind this insincere reconciliation lay not the dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embrace Ulbricht 's seedy puppet regime was one of the most powerful levers in Central European diplomacy-the future of the Oder-Neisse frontier between Poland and Germany . It is a question that agitates both sides of the Iron Curtain , and will play a large part in any future Western dickering with Khrushchev . <P> Moving West . The exact shape of Poland today ( as so often in the past ) is not the result of nature or of justice , but of the machinations of outsiders . In the closing months of World War II , the Russians coolly announced that they intended to keep permanently the 68,667 sq . mi. of eastern Poland , beyond the so-called Curzon line , which they had grabbed in the piping days of the Nazi-Soviet Pact . As compensation , Stalin proposed to give the Poles large chunks of the provinces of East Prussia , Pomerania and Silesia-all in all , some 38,660 sq . mi. of former German territory , including coal deposits richer than those of the Ruhr . <P> At Teheran and Yalta , Franklin Roosevelt and Winston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland West , " and when the Polish government in exile demurred , Churchill bluntly told the House of Commons that henceforth Poland " must honestly follow a policy friendly to Russia . " When protests were raised over Polish plans to expel the entire German population of the " recovered territories " - between 4,800,000 and 5,800,000 Germans were ultimately driven out of the area , mostly to West Germany-Labor Party Leader Clement Attlee declared that the Germans " are not entitled to appeal on the basis of moral laws that they have disregarded . " <P> But while Russia argued that Poland 's western frontier should run along the Oder and Western Neisse rivers , Britain and the U.S. held out for the Oder and Eastern Neisse . Unable to settle this detail , the Big Three agreed at Potsdam to postpone final determination of Poland 's border until the final peace treaty with Germany . In the meantime , they decided , Poland should have the real estate .
