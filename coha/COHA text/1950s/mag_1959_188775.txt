" My aim is to organize humanity without a God and without a king , " cried Premier Jules Ferry , and in 1880 the Third Republic began passing the laws out of which France 's public schools were born . It was an old passion with anticlerical Frenchmen , who could not forget the clergy flocking to support King Louis XVIII ( 1814-24 ) and the Bourbon restoration . The government ordered a new curriculum that was stripped of all religious overtones . <P> Even when the old bitterness subsided after World War I , France 's traditional anticlericalism-a strain that runs from Voltaire to Sartre-remained just below the surface . In 1945 , when De Gaulle set up his postwar government , he , though himself a devout Catholic communicant , curtly withdrew the wartime subsidies that Vichy had set aside for Church-run schools . But still , one in five French children attended the church schools , though the buildings were often in miserable shape , and learning , except for the top Jesuit schools , suffered from ill-paid and inferior teaching . The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French government since , including De Gaulle 's Fifth Republic . Last week , when the government finally sent to the National Assembly a draft bill offering conditional aid to parochial schools , the guerre scolaire-and not the guerre Algrienne-once again became the most emotional issue in France . <P> <P> No Butter , No Milk . In such predominantly Catholic regions as Normandy , Brittany and La Vende , children who attend public schools and their parents are occasionally denied the sacraments . In one Vende town the cur himself told his congregation : " You have a good laque teacher , but even if she were a saint , you should not send your children to her . " The teacher soon found that children would turn from her in the street , and that farmers refused to sell her butter and milk . In cities the tables are often turned : a child returning from confession finds himself taunted in the streets . <P> Though De Gaulle has long looked with sympathy at the financial plight of the parochial schools , it was not until last October that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to consider a formula for aid . But the big question still remained : How much control would the church schools have to accept in return ? The cardinals and bishops of France signed a statement pleading with the government not to touch the autonomy of the parochial schools , and even the Freemasons broke precedent by plunging into the controversy . But of all the arguments that flew over France , few were more prolonged than the one in the Cabinet itself .
