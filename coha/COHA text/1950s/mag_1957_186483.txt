What are the sources of Protestant-Roman Catholic tension in the U.S. ? Last week the Jesuit weekly America listed three areas of friction in a lead article ( written for CBS 's Church of the Air radio show , but denied clearance because it was judged too controversial ) by Editor in Chief Thurston N. Davis . The sore points as Jesuit Davis sees them : <P> BIRTH CONTROL . " Some Protestants speak of birth control as a positive virtue . They are hurt and perhaps humiliated that their code of personal morality in this matter is held to be grossly wrong by their Catholic friends . The Catholic Church views this practice as contrary to the natural law , that is , to the law of human reason itself . The birth-control question is only a part of her total philosophical and theological view of the right relations between husband and wife . " <P> PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS . " The Catholic parent who exercises his undisputed right to educate his child in the atmosphere of a Catholic school is convinced that an integral education-a complete education-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in man 's obligations to know , love and serve God his Creator and Redeemer . Protestants very often misunderstand the parochial school . Too often they repeat the slogan about the Catholic school being a ' divisive ' influence on American society . " <P> CENSORSHIP . " The Legion of Decency and the National Office for Decent Literature ... do not regard themselves as ' censors . ' They do , however , publish moral appraisals of movies and books . As a result , they are looked upon by Protestants as ' unAmerican pressure groups , ' or as symbols of the intolerance of Catholics . But the Legion addresses its directives only to Catholics . Protestants are just as concerned as Catholics are to protect their youngsters from suggestive and defiling influences . The trouble is that some Protestants seem to feel themselves almost obliged to patronize the movie which the Catholics condemned-just because the Catholics condemned it . " <P> Father Davis ' prescription : " Protestants and Catholics should get together to talk over-not merely their differences - but also the vast areas of common concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initiative . " <P> For years a small but recurring sore point between Protestants and Catholics has been the movies ' preponderance of Catholic priests over Protestant ministers . Last week George A. Heimrich , West Coast head of . the National Council of Churches ' Broadcasting and Film Commission , totted up the 1956 figures on films with Catholic and Protestant themes and happily announced the result : four to one in favor of the Protestants . Lutheran Heimrich gave most of the credit for better Protestant billing to the Council of Churches ' campaign to inform producers about Protestantism . One lost battle of the campaign : the council appealed to ministers for film scripts , got several and rejected them all . The flaw : " They would never get the seal of approval of the Production Code Administration , for in part ( e.g. , by portraying pastors bossed around by church-board members ) they show the Protestant religion in a very bad light . "
