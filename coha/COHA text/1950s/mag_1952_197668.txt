Way back in 1868 , so the story goes , Queen Victoria settled the Bolivia problem in her own imperious way . General Mariano Melgarejo , the Bolivian dictator of the day , had urgently invited the British Minister to attend a reception in honor of the general 's new mistress . When the diplomat frostily declined , the affronted dictator had him tied aboard a donkey , facing aft , and trotted him three times around the main square of La Paz . The minister fled home and told Queen Victoria of the outrage . " Where is Bolivia ? " the Queen demanded . A map was brought and the Queen was tactfully shown that La Paz was much too far inland for the guns of a British man-of-war to force a suitable apology . So-says the legend-the Queen took a pen , scratched a few lines across the map and declared : " Bolivia no longer exists . " <P> Last week the picturesque , landlocked mountain republic of Bolivia was back on the map as never before in its obscure but violent 127-year history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionary government had nationalized the country 's three big tin companies and placed their mines under a new , government-run Bolivian Mining Corp . It was the most important act of nationalization in Latin America since Mexico seized the foreign oil companies in 1938 . For better or for worse , it made the nationalist government of President Victor Paz Estenssoro the most important since SimOn Bolivar founded the republic in 1825 . <P> The Hand That Feeds . The audacity of the nationalization act , say Bolivia 's superheated nationalists , was equaled only by the necessity for it . Determined to assert the fact of their nationhood , they are willing to risk biting off the hand that feeds them . Tin pays for 50% of the food that they must now import from abroad . It is the foundation of their teetering economy , source of 80% of their foreign exchange and almost half of their government revenue . And for years Bolivian tin-and Bolivia itself-has been dominated by the three expropriated companies : Pati ? o , Hochschild , Aramayo . <P> Starting at the turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appetite ( for food containers , automobile bearings , welding ) , Simon I. Patio . a cholo ( half-Indian ) from Cochabamba , parlayed an abandoned Bolivian tin mine into a fortune estimated at a cool $1 billion . His annual income used to surpass the government 's . He formed a world cartel , bought heavily into Malayan tin , and lived abroad like an emperor , marrying his son Antenor to a niece of Spain 's Alfonso XIII , his daughters to a French count and a Spanish grandee of such exalted lineage that he was entitled to keep his hat on while chatting with his king . Making himself Bolivian minister to France ( to avoid the nuisance of paying French taxes ) , old Simn handsomely built his own legation-plus palaces in Biarritz and Nice-and three Bolivian mansions , costing $30 million , two of which he never even saw before his death in 1947.
