The price of money , like most other prices in the high-pressure Canadian economy , continued to creep upward last week . For the sixth time in 15 months , the Bank of Canada raised its rate on loans to chartered banks . The country 's basic interest rate was increased from 3% to 3% , * the highest ever charged by the government-owned central bank . <P> Past increases in the Bank of Canada interest rate were imposed to tighten the money supply and curb inflation . The latest increase , while it will have some anti-inflationary effect , was applied primarily for another reason : to get the government out of an embarrassing fiscal squeeze . In its most recent short-term ( go-day ) borrowings , the government had been forced to pay an interest rate of 3.26% , a slightly higher rate than the 3.25% interest on loans made through the Bank of Canada . That situation was obviously untenable ; chartered banks would have been able to borrow from the government , then lend back the government 's own funds to the treasury at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block such uneconomic transactions was to raise the Bank of Canada rate . <P> <P> *The comparable U.S. Federal Reserve Bank rate is now 3% , up from 1% since May 1955.
