The Economic Stabilization Agency last week issued a broad and hazy price proclamation aimed at almost every businessman . ESA asked for a general freeze on prices except farm products ( about which ESA can do little ) , and a rollback of price increases since Dec. 1 . The freeze was voluntary , said ESA , but woe to the businessman who did n't obey . ESA warned that anyone who did not cooperate would be punished when " feasible , " apparently meaning when ESA makes the order mandatory and gets some price cops . <P> Just which prices were to be rolled back and which were to be frozen was not clear . Said ESA : " Any price increases after Dec. 1 which are in excess of those that would be permissible . . . will be subject to action . " To determine what is " permissible , " the Government set up four fuzzily conceived " fair standards " : <P> No manufacturer may boost prices if his profit before taxes is equal to or above his average profit between 1946 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any particular product may raise the price of that product enough to 1 ) " make it profitable , " or 2 ) to compensate for increased manufacturing costs since the start of the Korean war-whichever is lower . <P> Wholesalers and retailers may not impose higher markups than those of June 1950-unless their profits are below the 1946-49 base period . <P> Distributors may not boost prices on the basis of higher replacement costs , i.e. , out of fear that costs are going up . <P> No sooner was that news out than ESA fired off a telegram to 250 large manufacturers in every major industry : Would they please notify ESA at least seven days in advance of any planned price increase ? <P> Haberdasher 's System ? International Harvester Co. , which had raised prices 4% only a few days before , promptly announced that the price increases would be withdrawn while it studied ESA 's proclamation . Most other businessmen who had raised prices did nothing ; they simply did not know what the proclamation meant . <P> It seemed to mean that those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get off scot free ; and those who had postponed price increases as long as they could would be punished by a rollback . By the same token , the steel companies which raised their prices on Dec. 1 would be left alone , but manufacturers who raised prices on Dec. 2 to compensate for the steel boost would have to roll them back . Said one Chicagoan : " Rolling back prices in the face of higher costs must have been the system Mr. Truman used in his haberdashery to insure his going out of business . "
