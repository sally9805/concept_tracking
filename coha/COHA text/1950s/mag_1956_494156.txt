Asheville . In one of his letters he addresses her as " you mother of my spit'it who fed me with light . " The second was a father figure , George Pierce Baker of the 47 Workshop , who believed in the integrity of Wolfe 's talent and kept telling him , " Write ! Write ! Do nothing else . " The third was Aline Bernstein , whom he met on a boat returning from Europe in the summer of 1925 ; she was a successful stage designer , kind and practical , who was nineteen years older than Wolfe . She kept watch over him while he was writing Look Homeward , Angel . - V1 AXWELL EVARTS PERKINS , his edi- tor at Scribner 's , was the last and closest of these elder friends . Wolfe regarded him as a spiritual father , while Perkins ? who had five children , all daughters ? treated Wolfe as an only son .

Indeed , he was grateful to all , his foster parents , even when he quarreled with them , and before the end he was reconciled with all , of them except Baker , who had died too ' soon . But more than he relied on his capacity for learning from others ( and the lessons had to be those he wanted to learn ) more than he relied on his energy or strength or intelligence , Wolfe relied on his memory , or rather on a peculiar quality of his memory . He says in that fascinating little book , The Stor of a Novel : Y ? The quality of my memory is characterized , I believe , in more than ordinary degree by the intensity of its sense impressions , its power to evoke and bring back the odors , ? sounds , colors , shapes , and feel of things with concrete vividness . .. .

Or again it would ' be a bridge ; the look of an old iron bridge across an American river , the sound the train makes as it goes across it ; the spokeand-hollow rumble of the ties below . . . . or it would be , most lonely and haunting of all the sounds I know , the sound of a milk wagon as it enters an American street just at the first gray of the morning , the slow and lonely clop- ' ping of the hoof upon the street , the jink of bottles , the sudden rattle of a battered old milk can , the swift and hurried footsteps of the milkman , and again the jink of bottles , a low word . spoken to his horse , and then the great , slow , clopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such impressions , there was another feature of Wolfe 's memory , or rather of the experiences preserved in it , that gave an urgent force to his writing . Many of the experiences had a background and color that had never been portrayed in literature . There were tender-minded persons at the time who believed that events had to reach a certain order of dignity or seemliness before they were worthy of being treated in drama or fiction . Wolfe had quite a different feeling . " There is nothing so commonplace , so dull , " he had told Song of Remembrance R EMEMBER that death is a reminder That death is a blinder That death is a finder , 0 Remember that breath is a take That lungs will shake That wings will break , 0 Remember that bones are a battle That tomes are a-prattle That groans are a rattle , 0 Remember that eyes are a prying That eyes are adying That eyes are a hieing , 0 Remember that love is a gloving That loving is roving That living is loving , 0 Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 his mother , " that is not touched with nobility and dignity . " He knew that his mother would understand , because he had been talking about events in their own household . They belonged to a family of " good people , " in the Southern phrase , which means hard-working people , self-respecting and without pretensions . The name Wolfe was Pennsylvania German , and Tom 's father was a stone cutter born near Gettysburg . The Westalls , his mother 's family , were Scotch Irish from the Carolina mountains . On both sides they were eloquent talkers , but they had never tried to preserve their talk on paper . Tom was the first writer among them , or in the town where they lived , and his voice had more power because he was conscious of speaking for the silent generations and of giving them a sort of posthumous nobility . Like Dreiser in this respect , he was a new man , speaking for a new order of society , in a country that was still new in literature .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
