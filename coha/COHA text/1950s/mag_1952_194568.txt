St. Luke 's Church in Cambridge , England this week offered its congregation an experiment in popular church music : it got a clergyman-composer to present a new sung Mass in syncopated , calypso rhythm . <P> St. Luke 's " folk Mass " is a serious attempt at a modern version of plain chant . Its composer , the Rev. Geoffrey Phillips Beaumont , 49 , is the chaplain of Trinity College , Cambridge and an energetic amateur tunesmith who writes most of the music for Trinity 's annual revues . He wrote the sung Mass after clergymen friends had complained to him about their congregations ' distaste for traditional liturgical music . <P> As performed this week , with a two-piano accompaniment , the folk Mass turned out to be a framework of bouncy modern rhythms , themes on which priest and congregation improvised when making their responses . Said Composer Beaumont , defending his innovation : " I know that many people will not like it , because they do n't like light music . I ask them to offer up the Mass on behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church because they do n't like current conventional church music . "
