In a small working-class Rio de Janeiro home last week , a honey-skinned , hazel-eyed housewife named Elza Ferreira da Silva , packing her husband 's suitcases , slipped scribbled notes , written in Portuguese , into his shoes , into his socks , into his pockets  --  notes that read " There 's room on the shelf for another trophy " or " Bring back a medal for the kids " or simply " Win for me  --  love , Elza. " // Now in Chicago for the 1959 Pan American Games , Brazil 's Adhemar Ferreira da Silva gets a wifely boost with every change of socks . Judging by his past record he will go ahead to win  --  for Elza and Brazil  --  his offbeat , exacting , athletic specialty : the hop , step and jump  --  the longest leap in sports . // Known to all Brazil as Kangaroo , the lithe , long-legged Adhemar is probably the finest natural hop-step-and-jumper ever born . The first time he ever tried it he did 37 feet 5 inches . He 's won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set both Olympic and world records . Best athlete in Brazilian history and one of the world 's alltime champions , Adhemar is easily the brightest star of all the Latin Americans at Chicago . // He 's also a nice , easygoing guy who always totes his guitar to track meets . He sings in 10 languages  --  anything from sambas to Schubert  --  and enlivens postmeet parties with all-night song sessions . Then he goes to morning Mass . He 's made friends from Moscow to Modesto , Calif. , and still gets letters postmarked Melbourne and Helsinki from people he met at the last two Olympics . " I guess I was just born lucky , " he says . // Actually , he was born dirt-poor , got nowhere in sports until he was 21 , works hard at two jobs to bring up his kids and studies pre-law courses at night . Whenever he takes time out for a track meet abroad he must cram at night  --  sometimes until dawn  --  to catch up on classwork . With his responsibilities and years  --  he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires genuine personal sacrifice . Asked why he keeps it up , Adhemar flashes a bright grin . " Pour le sport , " he says , shrugging . " And for fun . " // An unalloyed amateur in the classic Olympic sense , Adhemar has one real grievance : the Soviet Union 's subsidized athletic system . " The amateur code is rigidly applied in the West , " he says , " but it 's flagrantly violated by the Soviet Union . // " I 've got nothing against the Russians , and I 'm not sorry for myself , but all amateur athletes feel the same way . Russian athletes are paid and pampered . They have the finest of facilities , full time to train and no worries about money . I ca n't afford time for training . I ca n't afford steak , let alone vitamins or high-protein pills . " // Grinning , he adds , " But , man , how those Russian athletes sweat and suffer to win glory for the old Red flag ! They 're so afraid to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't win . I 've seen it happen . Me , when I hit the track I 've got no worries about Siberia . " // COMPLEX-FREE BRAZIL // In Brazil , which is one of the most tolerant nations on earth , Adhemar , a Negro , was brought up free from discrimination . " Complexes never took hold of me , " says he . " I was a happy-go-lucky Brazilian kid . I never felt poor or oppressed or different . My folks worked hard , and we always managed to get by . " // His father , Antonio Ferreira da Silva , worked on the old S ? o Paulo railway , retiring on a pension recently after 31 years . His mother , Augusta , took in washing and mending . When Adhemar was 7 they bought a small S ? o Paulo house with a big garden . In Brazil 's benign climate they grew fruits and vegetables the year around  --  avocados , pineapples , oranges and papayas . " It was a struggle every month to pay off the mortgage , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Recently he had it renovated for his folks . // As a kid Adhemar helped his mother deliver washing or worked in the yard and fed the chickens . His mother taught him the alphabet before kindergarten , sent him to a Christian Brothers ' school and later to S ? o Paulo Technical School . " He was born good and grew up even better , " his mother says . // As a lanky teen-ager , guitar-playing Adhemar entered every radio amateur contest he heard of and won them all . He dreamed of musical fame . Instead fame came in sports  --  the hard way . As the star of the neighborhood soccer team , he tried out in 1947 for the big , top-ranking S ? o Paulo Futebol Clube . He did n't make the team , but he impressed the club 's track coach , German-born Dietrich Gerner , who has been his mentor ever since . " Ballerinas practice in a room filled with mirrors to watch how they 're doing , " says Adhemar . " Gerner is my mirror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect track-and-field physique  --  all legs ( 3 feet 6 ? inches of his 5-foot 10-inch height ) and long , hard , supple muscle , but he flopped at everything he attempted . // " I tried him in the 100-meter dash , " says Gerner . " I tried him in the high jump . I tried him in the broad jump . I tried him at the distances . After nearly two years , I 'd just about lost hope . Then he tried the hop , step and jump and went 11.40 meters 37 feet 5 inches . That 's great for the first time , and I could n't believe it . But I remeasured it myself and , by God , it was 11.40 . From then on he just leaped to glory . " // " O SALTO TRIPLICE " // Daily , after practice sessions , Adhemar bragged to the folks at home about his hop , step and jumps ( or , in Portuguese , o salto triplice  --  the triple jump ) . He did 12 meters , then 12.40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches ) . " We did n't know what he was doing or what he was talking about , " says his mother . " He was happy ; that 's all we knew . We never did see him do the hop , step and jump until after he became the world champion , and then we got so curious we had to go watch . " Says Adhemar : " After trying so long , it was wonderful to be good at something . " // The hop , step and jump is the most demanding of the jumping events , possibly excepting the pole vault . It requires utmost balance , flexibility and thrust  --  not for a single jump but for a flying series of three . Other jumpers , after their take-off , land in a cushion of sand or sawdust , but the triple jumper gets a triple jarring : after his take-off he lands twice with a fearsome thud on the hard track before finally hitting the soft pit . It 's hard on sinews , muscles and bones  --  and often disabling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 52 feet 5 7/8 inches )  --  Helio Coutinho da Silva ( no relation ) , who did 15.99 in 1951  --  broke his leg on his next try . // Adhemar hops off with a powerful push of his right foot , lands on that foot ( usually out 19 to 20 feet or more ) , immediately takes a long step ( a 14-to 15 ? - foot step ) to the left foot , and then jumps off that left foot ( another 16 ? to 17 ? feet ) before landing on both feet in the pit . " I 'm a donkey at math , " says Adhemar , " but on a jump I can figure it down to the centimeter by feel . " // As an athlete , according to Coach Gerner , " Da Silva 's greatest asset is his formidable sense of equilibrium . " To Adhemar , a jump is a fascinating mechanical problem , in which " the muscles work like springs and levers . You 've got to have perfect control and , of course , your muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you sleep badly , or you ate the wrong thing  --  well , that 's what makes an athlete lose . But with physical conditions equal , it 's control that counts . " // Adhemar had just discovered the hop , step and jump when he made Brazil 's 1948 Olympic team . It was his first trip outside Brazil , or even S ? o Paulo . In London he felt like a stranger . He was tongue-tied and lost , and he never even made the final round . In 11 years since , he 's won them all , repeatedly  --  World University Games , South America Championship , Pan American Games and Olympics . // He tied the world record in 1950 , broke it in 1951 , broke it again , twice , in 1952 , and broke it again in 1955 . He won the hop , step and jump at the first Pan American Games ever held , at Buenos Aires in 1951 , retained his title at Mexico City in 1955 , and is odds-on to win it a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympics at Helsinki in 1952 , at the Olympics at Melbourne in 1956 and , despite the fact that a Russian , Oleg Fedoseyev , is the current world record holder ( 54 feet 9 ? inches ) , Da Silva will be a favorite at the Olympics at Rome in 1960. // In training Adhemar has never exceeded 50 feet 4 inches , but when the heat 's on he excels . In 1956 , when he left for the Melbourne Olympics , Adhemar had just gone through a rugged qualifying month , after two years of training , for a physical instructor 's degree , with daily sessions in swimming , water polo , basketball , volleyball , soccer , obstacle course and other trials . " I was in fine shape physically , " says Adhemar , " but technically , for the hop , step and jump , no . I had n't done it even once for weeks . " // Then , in Melbourne , his lean jaw blew up as big as a softball with a tooth infection . " It was misery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three days with no solid food , and got up groggy from antibiotic shots . " // On the big day Adhemar got up early for a steak-and-egg breakfast at 6 a.m . " At track meets I always make friends with the cook , " he says , " and that cook in Melbourne was a real mother to me . She got up early herself to fix breakfast for me ahead of the meal schedule . " Afterward he took a hot bath and a cold shower , limbered up and played with the kids hanging around the Olympic Village . He lunched on another steak , with salad , at 11 , then went to sleep for two hours ( " while those poor Russians worried and fretted " ) and woke up feeling great . Just as he left for the stadium , he got a perfectly timed pep letter from wife Elza. // In the qualifying rounds 26 of the 32 entrants were eliminated . Iceland 's surprising Vilhjulmur Einarsson set a new Olympic record , 53 feet 3 ? inches . Adhemar 's best was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet Union was three-quarters of an inch behind Da Silva . " They thought I was doing badly , " Adhemar remembers , " but it was n't important . I never start to worry until the finals . " // That afternoon Adhemar won his second Olympic gold medal and broke Einarsson 's new Olympic record with a last-ditch salto triplice of 53 feet 7 ? inches . Einarsson never matched his excellent qualifying mark , and Kreer , who had qualified at 52 feet 6 ? inches , turned in a miserable 50 feet 10 ? inches and fouled on his last two jumps . " Poor guy , he had orders to win , " says Adhemar . " He just fell apart . " // Adhemar is only fair in other events but takes a fling at them anyway in Brazilian track meets to win points for his club . At the hop , step and jump , nobody in 20 Latin American nations comes near him . // AMATEURS ' AMATEUR // Now , as always , Adhemar must struggle to make ends meet . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a job in a shop mass-producing statuary for gardens and cemeteries paid off in pennies . He tried office work and selling , and then got a S ? o Paulo city-hall job . Ironically , during a municipal crackdown in 1953 , he was fired because of repeated leaves for track meets  --  a bitter dose to swallow for his loyalty to the amateur code , to which he has been so dedicated that in 1953 , when an ardent public raised enough money to buy Adhemar a gift home , he turned it down rather than be classified a professional . When his mother could n't understand his gesture he explained that accepting the home would mean he could no longer compete in events such as the Olympics . His mother 's thoughtful reply : " Then it would not be a happy home . " // Adhemar 's adherence to the classical interpretation of amateurism was recognized when the International Olympic Committee awarded him the Mohammed Taher Trophy , presented to the amateur athlete whose general merit or career justifies a special distinction . Fanny Blankers-Koen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trophy . // In 1956 Adhemar got his present jobs in Rio as an instructor at a labor recreation center and , on weekends , for a government-sponsored student recreation program . " I handle 900 teen-agers on Sunday , " says Adhemar , " and I make them jump . " // Both jobs pay a total of only 25,000 cruzeiros ( about $165 ) monthly , though Adhemar earns extra income by writing sports stories for Rio 's daily Ultima Hora . Last fall he earned no money but had his expenses paid when he played a key role in the movie Carnival Orpheus , produced by France 's Marcel Camus . Last month , resplendent in a rented tuxedo , he was hailed , along with Camus and others in the cast , at a black-tie S ? o Paulo premi ? re . // Back in December 1953 , Adhemar married his longtime sweetheart , Elza Santos , who was his neighbor and a childhood confidante . " We were in love , but we did n't know it until one day in 1951 , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . Mother fixed up the parlor real nice , but Adhemar went right to the kitchen , messed around with the pots and pans , had something to eat , and then began playing his guitar and singing . When he left , my folks all said , ' Elza , that 's the man for you to marry . ' " // They 're still a honeymoon couple . Says Elza , " I 'm so happy I 'm almost afraid . He loves the children and the house and me , and I do n't hope for anything more in life . " They have two children , 4-year-old daughter Adyel and one-year-old Adhemar Ferreira da Silva Jr . // Miserably lonely during Adhemar 's long trips abroad , Elza nevertheless insists that he stay in competitive sports at least until the 1960 Olympics . Adhemar is deeply grateful . " With a different wife I would have dropped out years ago , " says he . " For a family with no money , international amateur athletics is too much of a sacrifice . Marriage is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // As a star athlete , Adhemar has traveled all over Latin America , Europe and the United States . He has been to Iceland and Japan , Sweden and Spain , California and Moscow . " I 've sure been places and seen things , " says Adhemar . " I 've seen the Louvre and the Empire State Building , Buckingham Palace and the Folies-Berg ? re , the Kremlin and the Golden Gate . I 've seen more old masters in European museums than I can remember , and I 've been to Mme. Tussaud 's waxworks museum in London five times . I 've learned a little bit about the world and a lot about people . " // THE NEEDY RUSSIANS // For fun Adhemar has sung and played his guitar  --  especially , haunting Brazilian folk songs and steaming sambas  --  over radio stations and at nightclubs from Finland to Fresno . In Moscow , where he won the hop , step and jump in a 1957 international meet ( " It was so cold I had to warm up for two hours " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Moscow 's a pretty sad place , " says Adhemar , " but just once I promoted a real night out , with caviar and lots of vodka , and sambas , plus rock ' n ' roll . I 'm telling you , they were going crazy and screaming for more . That 's what the Russians need , plain old fun . " // Abroad , Adhemar misses his Brazilian dishes , but he gobbles up exotic new items like American hamburgers and sundaes ( " I could live on them forever " ) . A natural linguist , he 's picked up good English and French , plus fluent bits of Russian , Czech , German , Italian , Japanese , Spanish and Icelandic . // " There 's no place I 've been treated better or treated worse than in the United States , " Adhemar says . " I remember one time in Modesto where after the meet we sang and danced all night , ending up with a real fun breakfast at 7 a.m. , ham and eggs American-style. " // But on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas Relays in Austin and felt for the first time in his life the grating strain of segregation . " Everybody was as nice as could be and I had no trouble , " says Adhemar , " except I just had to stay away from where white people went . I felt pretty bad . I 'm never again going any place where I have to worry about color . " // Brightening , he adds , " But I had a wonderful time out West . California is n't Dixie . I met old friends from my last trip , back in 1955 . At Fresno State I presented the student awards and I got a picture from Ann Blyth , the ' campus queen of the battling Bulldogs . ' She inscribed it : ' To my wonderful Brazilian friend . P.S. Please come back next year . ' That was real nice . " // At Fresno , Adhemar casually set a new U.S. hop , step and jump record : 52 feet 4 inches , which was later broken by Alvis Andrews with a 52-feet 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost paternal about Andrews ' record . " Alvis and I talked and jumped and worked out together for weeks during my trip , " he says . " That 's what I went up there for , to work with Americans . You got some good boys . " // After a muscle injury in Sweden last year , Adhemar took hydrocortisone injections and a two-month layoff . Starting again , he hit respectively 51 feet 1 inch , 51 feet 11 ? inches , 53 feet 3 ? inches on his first three tries . After breaking the U.S. record , and winning other California meets in May , he flew back for the ABC meet ( Argentina , Brazil and Chile ) in S ? o Paulo , dashed from the plane to the track and won easily . // After that he put in a rugged month of college exams ( " Friends took notes for me while I was gone " ) and a physical education advanced course from a group of European instructors . He passed both tests in a breeze . As an official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome 's arrangements for the 1960 Olympics . And , of course , he flew to Chicago for the Pan American games . " I 'm going to bring back some nylon clothes for the kids and a few souvenirs , " he says . " And , I hope , a medal for Elza. "
