When existentialism first became the rage in Paris , she was a slinky creature with a dubious reputation . She came from a good enough family ( one grandfather was Danish Philosopher Sren Kierkegaard , as respectable as he was gloomy ) , but the lady 's morals were , to say the least , confused . But that never stopped anyone from making a hit in Paris . <P> The sidewalk existentialists said that , since nothing really mattered very much , everything mattered . Since life was too utterly futile , everybody ought to live it to the hilt . " It is absurd for us to be born , " proclaimed existentialism 's protector , Jean-Paul Sartre . " It is absurd for us to die . " For Parisian intellectuals , desperately in quest of an interesting pose , this was the ticket . <P> In St. Germain des Prs , on the Left Bank , long-haired men and short-haired women worked diligently to keep the cult going . Bebop botes , hairdos , beards , evening gowns , newspapers , cocktails , hot-dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would curse : " Espce d'existentialiste . " Existentialism became a familiar tourist attraction , like the Folies-Bergere . Sartre , increasingly successful and respectable , occasionally deplored the popularizations of his fad-he even felt compelled to move out of his favorite caf , the Flore , to escape the tourists ' vulgar stares . Last week existentialism took its ultimate step to solid respectability . The dignified Collge de France elected Existentialist Philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty-an old school friend of Sartre's-to its coveted chair of philosophy . <P> The Collge ( founded in 1530 by Franois I ) is something like the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton : its members do not have to bother with students or lectures ; they get paid ( about $5,000 a year ) to sit and think . This Merleau-Ponty is eminently well qualified to do . A shy , retiring type , less noticed than his flashier school chum , he has been writing heavy technical works on philosophy ( The Structure of Behavior , The Phenomenology of Perception ) . In the existentialist cafs , Merleau-Ponty 's appointment was greeted with dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blue denims and a wind jacket , " you think you are in the avant-garde and then one day , presto , you are in the rear guard .
