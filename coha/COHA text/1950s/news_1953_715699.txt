txt The first bolt from the crimeencrusted International Longshoremen 's Association came yesterday with the granting of a charter in another American Federation of Labor union to an , I. L. A. local representing 2,500 workers in New York lumber yards . The new charter was issued by Dave Beck , president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , the largest and most powerful unit in the A. F. L. Mr. Beck 's action was the hardest blow in one of the roughest days the pier union has had since the New York and New Jersey Legislatures approved laws to oust gangsters from control of the waterfront . Other Significant Moves Here were some of the day 's other developments : ( IThe shipping employers , after joining with the union in the first " goldfish bowl " negotiations in maritime history here , notified the dock workers that they would not take part - in any more contract talks , public or private , until the union ended outlaw strikes on three Jersey City piers . The union promised to do its best , but the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waldman , tor the last twelve years counsel to the union 's wage scale committee , quit his . post because he could not stomach the policies and tactics advocated by " those who now have control of the I. L. A. organizations in the Port of New York . " He refused to name the men he meant , but it was learned that he had become convinced that underworld elements were seeking to use the strike weapon as a means of Ups setting the new port control statutes . 49The employers gave categorical notice to the union that they would not team up with the I. L. A. in a court test of the constitutionality of the laws , which require all longshoremen to register at state employment centers , and would not agree to any contract proposals that sought to evade or flout the state rules . 9Fearful that the whole port and possibly the whole Atlantic coast would be shut down by strikes when present contracts expired Oct. 1 , shipping interests began discussing the chances that President Eisenhower would apply for an eighty-day , no-strike injunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Propriety at Wage Session Despite the turbulent background of the wage talks , the first day of face-to-face discussions with the press in the negotiating room was the most decorous that union or management representatives could remember in all their years of dealing with one another . The union had proposed that reporters be allowed to sit in on the negotiations at the Governor Clinton Hotel , and the New York Shipping Association had said it had no objection . Such rough-and-ready characters on the union side as Anthony ( Tough Tony ) Anastasia , boss of the Brooklyn docks , and Harold Bowers , secretary of the Pistol Local on the upper West Side , took the floor to present their views on contract points in polite terms unadorned with ' expletives or threats . However , the day brought no headway toward an agreement . In disclosing that he had granted a teamsters ' charter to the I. L. A. members in the lumber yards here , Mr. Beck emphasized that his union had no intention of taking in longshoremen , as such . Several I. L. A. dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the . A. F. L. , that they want to stay in the federation if the parent organization decides to expel the I. L. A. at its convention in St. Louis Sept. 21 . However , Beck aides made it clear that any action the teamsters might take toward keeping such locals under the A. F. L. banner would be made in concert with the rest of the federation and would not be directed toward bringing longshoremen into the Beck union . Mr. Beck said lumber handlers in most cities already belonged to the teamsters and no extension of the union 's jurisdiction was involved in taking in the New York group . The unit that got the charter was Local 205 of the I. L. A. , headed by Sigmund ( Whitey ) Brovarski , It is to be known as Local 1205 of the teamsters . The withdrawal of Mr. Waldman as counsel to the L. A. wage scale committee did not represent a complete break between him and the pier union . He continues as counsel to the international union in the conduct of regular union business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joseph P. Ryan , in connection with his indictment on charges of helping himself to union funds . Waldman Explains Stand In announcing his decision , ? Mrj Waldman said : " I regret to say that recent events have demonstrated that my firm and I disagree fundamentally with those who now have control of the L L , A. organizations in the Port of New York and the executive council of the Atlantic Coast district on the function and responsibility of a labor union and on matters of policy , principle , approach and tactics . " He added that he could not " in good conscience " defend the ' group 's policies and tactics or ad-1 vise those who pursued them . He ' informed the committee of his re-I fusal to serve at a private meeting ' a few minutes before the public ' session with the employers began at 11 A. M. The outlaw strikes that caused the employers to warn that there would be no more meetings until a settlement had been effected were called by members of Local 1247 of 1. h I. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Export Line and Pier 9 of the American President Line , all in Jersey City . No Wage Increase Obtained The one-year contract agreed upon , with a wage review in six months , provides for no general wage increase , although for bargaining purposes the sailors had demanded an increase of 6 per cent in all ratings , as well as in overtime and penalty pay . On this point the committee commented to the membership : " Although we were unable to raise the wages or the overtime or penalty time , we feel that the conditions gained in these negotiations more than offset any wage rise . As a matter of fact , the earning power of a sailor today in the Sailors Union is higher than on the Zest Coast with their new wage rise . " Several gains were registered , however , in addition to the pension plea . The present monthly allowance of $10 a month for uniforms was raised to $15 . Payments of $300 to $500 for loss of clothing and personal belongings in case of shipwreck or disaster were provided and @ @ @ @ @
