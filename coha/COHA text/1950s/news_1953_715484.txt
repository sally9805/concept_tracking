txt IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY , London , June 2 ? Amid ancient ceremony and medieval pomp in this abbey today , the Archbishop of Canterbury placed the heavy crown of Edward the Confessor upon the head of his radiant young sovereign , Elizabeth II . For a brief moment a hush fell across the-abbey . Then a fanfare of trumpets sounded . The peers and peeresses of the realm donned their coronets and a chorus broke forth " God Save Queen Elizabeth . " And through the tall Gothic windows , over the heads of those servants of the crown  --  the Queen 's field and air marshals , generals , admirals and , most redoubtable of all , the Queen 's Prime Minister , Sir Winston Churchill  --  came the dull boom of guns from the venerable Tower fortress down the Thames . It was as if to signify that Britain , in a swiftly changing world , stood fast upon her own traditions , determined to maintain them in Britain 's own way . The curious mixture of religious , military and governing significance derives from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from partpagan customs of the Saxon kings of Wessex , from the conquering // Normans and the conquered Scots . A. blending of early and late Christian theology , medieval clerical costumes and regalia , Renaissance aristocratic garb , military uniforms of the regiments that broke Napoleon  --  all were woven into a magnificent tissue that had a curiously Byzantine impact . Hardly a soul entering through the abbey doors looked as if he or she had stepped in from the humdrum twentieth century world . Yet , there was effective living reality to the solemn contract negotiated between Elizabeth and her people by this deeply religious ceremony . Eleven Commonwealth Prime Ministers in addition to twentythree princes and princesses from foreign lands and eight colonial , rulers gave both color and political , meaning to the rites . At precisely 6 o'clock this cold spring morning the Duke of Norfolk , leading Roman Catholic layman in this Protestant nation , and Earl Marshal of the coronation bY hereditary right , ordered the Abbey doors thrown open . From that moment a protracted drama of rich imagery and deep spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who themselves lent color and reality to the great living dance , filed to their seats . Lords and ladies in red velvet , banded with ermine and with miniver , swept in . Tiered rows in specially constructed transept galleries filled gradually with changing bands of colored dress . Below , upon a golden-hued carpet , placed upon a dias in the cen ter stood the royal throne upon which the Queen eventually re ceived her homage . Eastward , toward the altar , rested the gnarled brown oaken chair of King Edward I , built over the Stone of Scone , upon which she was to be crowned . In one bank of ruby red and white sat the peers of the realm and across from them , robed in velvet and ermine , wearing bejeweled tiaras , their diamonds glittering in the light , were their magnificently attired wives . A Human Tapestry Gradually a great human tapestry assembled : clerical , martial and aristocratic splendor ; scarlet , crimson , ruby and maroon ; gold , silver , purple , mulberry , blue and severe white and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pathans from Pakistan in high turbans , the Sultan of Zrnazibar , Arab sheikhs and Sultans . At 11 o'clock Queen Elizabeth 's coach drew up before the Abbey 's annex gate . Slowly she walked below the carved effigies of her royal beasts with ferociously aristocratic miens  --  the lion of England , the unicorn of Scotland , the greyhound of the Tudors , the dragon of - the Tudors , the falcon of the Plantagenets , the griffin of King Edward III , the white horse of Hanover , the bull of Lionel , Duke of Clarence ; the white lion of Mortimer and the yale of the Beauforts , silver with gold spots , hooves , horns , tusks and tufts of hair . The last and highest ranking spectators , including the Queen Mother , Princess Margaret , the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent , assumed their seats . Ten outstanding peers and three bishops took up le items of royal regalia ? swords , scepters , crowns and chalices . Then the climactic procession started eastward toward the high altar of all that is holiest in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbey entered followed by representatives of the free Protestant churches of the United Kingdom , leaders of knightly orders in flowing robes of blue scarlet white and darkest green , standard bearers , and the officers of the Herald 's College and the Scottish Court of Chivalry , wearing square gold and crimson tabards and bearing these proud names of bygone chivalry : Bluemantle , Clarenceux King of Arms , Garter King of Arms , Portcullis , Norry and Ulster King of Arms , Rouge Dragon , Rouge Croix and the Heralds of Somerset , Windsor , Richmond , York , Lancaster and Chester ; the Lord Lyon King of Arms ( an elderly Scot who fainted at the dress rehearsal Friday ) , Caraick Pursuivnnt , Lion placer ; Marchmont , Albany and Rothesay Heralds , and Kintyre and Unicorn Pursuivants . The Prime Ministers of Ceylon , Pakistan , India , South Africa , New Zealand , Australia and Canada , followed by Sir Winston , resplendent in the garb of Garter Knight , took seats along the aisle behind Lady Churchill . Symbol of Unity and Hope The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diocese 's archbishop ; then the Cross of Canterbury , followed by England 's primate . Then came the Duke of Edinburgh , his uniform covered by a ruby and ermine robe , and wearing the great collar of the Order of the Garter . He was followed by a processoin of the objects of regalia carried by the peers of church and state . And , as the pupils of Westminster School hailed her with thr traditional musical strains of " Vivat , Vivat , " came the Queen . Then began those extraordinary rites that establish the sovereignty nf an English king or queen . The Archbishop of Canterbury , the Lord Chancellor , the Earl Marshal and the Garter King at Arms walked to the east side of the theatre formed at the transepts interception . As the Queen stood up behind him ( ' the primate asked the people in a resonant clear voice : " Sirs , I here present unto you Queen Elizabeth , your undoubted Queen : Wherefore all you who are come this day to do your homage and service , are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this to the four points of the compass . Four times the Queen curtsied to the nation 's representatives . And four times , preceded by the flourish of trumpets , came the shouted answer : " God Save Queen Elizabeth . " Under English custom no sovereign is crowned until first voluntarily bound by an oath to preserve the law of this extraordinary nation 's powerful but unwritten coraitution . The church , represented by the primate and the bishops , witnesses the contract between ruler and subjects . Religion , as it were , is on the one hand safeguard for the people 's freedom and on the other authority for their symbolic magistrate-in-chief . Oath on a Great Bible Therefore the primate asked the Queen - " will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the peoples of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , The Union of South Africa , Pakistan and Ceylon , and of your possessions and the other territories to any of them belonging or pertaining , according to their respective laws and customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise so to do . " More than a few here , remembering the coronation of George VI , noted the absence of any Indian mention in the oath . That state is now a republic that recognizes the Queen , not as sovereign but only as titular head of a commonwealth of independent nations . Having concluded the series of interrogatories that comprise her oath , the Queen laid her right hand on a Great Bible and swore upon it , " The things which I have here before promised I will perform and keep . So help me God . " Then , as sovereign and subjects knelt , the Archbishop commenced the communion service . " O God , who providest for Thy people by Thy power , and rulest over them in love , " he prayed , " grant unto Thy servant Elizabeth , our Queen , the spirit of wisdom and government , that being devoted unto Thee with her whole heart , she may so wisely govern , that in her time Thy church may be in safety , and , Christian devotion may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar as the choir sang the Creed . The Queen Knelt upon a faldstool by her chair . The strains of Handel 's choral music on " Zadok the Priest , " who anointed King Solomon , sounded its chords . The Queen sat in the chair of King Edward . Bare-headed , she faced the Abbey sanctuary while a canopy of heavy cloth of gold , was raised above her to screen her from her subjects ' view . It was held by four great Garter Knights : The Viscount Allendale , the Earl Fortescue , and the Dukes of Wellington and Portland . A sudden bright streak of sunlight broke through the leaden sky and , piercing the high gothic windows , illuminated the solid bank of peeresses , rendering momentarily incandescent their diamonds and tiaras . Gently the Lord Great Chamberlain and the Mistress of the Robes divested the Queen of her velvet robe and replaced it with the simple white garment she wore during the anointment . While the music Handel wrote for King George III 's coronation resounded through the Abbey where the composer himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands , breast and head , saying : " And as Solomon was anointed king by Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet , so be thou anpinted , blessed and consecrated Queen over the people 's . " Regalia Brought to Her The Dean of Westminster then aided the Queen to don a brilliant heavy robe of cloth of gold called " supertunica " and girdle . One by one the regalia of her authority were brought to her from the altar : golden spurs , the sword of state , the pointed sword of justice to the temporality or the third sword , the pointed sword of justice to the spirituality or second sword , Curtana the sword of mercy , the rod with the dove , the orb , King Edward 's staff , the scepter with the cross . A long pall of cloth of gold called the Robe Royal was draped I over her , the Queen 's ring , a ruby cross fixed upon sapphire , placed upon her finger , and the Queen herself sat upright in King Edward 's chair holding her scepter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted King Edward 's crown and blessed it . The Dean of Westminster brought it to him . For a moment ) he held it above Elizabeth , then placed it upon her brow . Until that moment no noble in the great assemblage wore a coronet upon his head . But , as the tower guns thundered in the distance and the trumpets blared ; as the entire Abbey resounded with echoing shouts of " God save the Queen , " the great lords and ladies of Britain , their arms swaying in one ballet of fluid . ruby red and ermine motion , placed ' upon their own heads their own aristocratic circlets . Then , as the Abbey stilled , the Archbishop told his now acknowledged ruler , spiritual and temporal : " God crown you with a crown of glory and righteousness , that having a right faith and manifold fruit of good works , you may obtain the crown of an everlasting kingdom by the gift of Him whose Kingdom endureth forever , " he blessed her He wished her : " Faithful parliaments and quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a prosperous industry ; wise counselors and upright magistrates ; leaders of integrity in learning and labor ; a devout , learned and useful clergy ; honest , peaceable and dutiful citizens . " The sovereign then quit the stark chair of King Edward , slowly turned , and mounted the golden carpeted steps to her new royal throne . She faced the Archbishop and he read : " Stand firm , and hold fast from henceforth the seat and state of royal and imperial dignity . " The Queen was monarch . First to genuflect before Her Majesty was the church , in the person of the Primate , while the other Bishops knelt in their places . Then the Duke of Edinburgh ascended the stairs of his wife 's throne , placed both his hands in hers , knelt , swore allegiance and kissed her upon the cheek . Said he " I Philip , Duke of . Edinburgh , do become your liege man of life and limb , and of earthly worship ; and faith and truth I will bear unto you , to live and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me God . " In successive order starting with the two royal Dukes of Gloucester and of Kent , the senior peer of each degree took off his coronet and swore fealty and " kissed his Queen 's hand . The choir sang religious homage . Then the drums beat and the , trumpets sounded and the people cried out , " God Save Queen Elizabeth ! Long Live Queen Elizabeth ! May the Queen live forever . " The bond between sovereign and every rank of subject having been finally compacted , the service concluded with the communion rites . The Queen ? descended from her throne and , again bareheaded before her God , tool bread and wine from her Bishop and , making her Oblation , offered an altar cloth and ingot of gold weighing one pound , to the church . . The Duke of Edinburgh joined her , removing his coronet , - and the couple knelt together at England 's sanctuary ? while the Primate blessed them in I prayer . The Queen repaired to the Holy Chapel of Saint Edward and changed her crown forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She doffed a robe of purple velvet and , assuming her scepter and her orb , proceeded slowly westward through her Abbey to the ? gates . of the world , the Twentieth Century , and the stern challenge of her times .
