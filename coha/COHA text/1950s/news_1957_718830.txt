txt The point was raised in a press Conference , and its implications were such as to measure the GOP regional parley here : " Why should the President be urging the election of congressmen from here when he is not getting their support ? " The questioner went on to say that he had looked at the voting record of 58 congressmen from six Midwest states represented here ? Ohio , Indiana , Illinois : Wisconsin , Michigan , and Missouri . He said that 50 of them had opposed federal aid to education and that all of them were for cutting the budget . Responsibility Cited The chairman of the Republican National Committee , Meade Alcorn , to whom the question was directed , answered quickly but obliquely . He merely said the President had indicated that he wanted a Republican Congress . Shortly before , the President had made his wishes most specific , He said , in a telephonic message to the state GOP committee members assembled here : " Since 1954 our party has not had the majority in Congress . Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political responsibility can be definitely fixed only when one party controls both the legislative and executive branches of our government . Then the praise  --  or the blame  --  can be fixed and properly adjudged by the people . " Earlier the President had made a plea in behalf of the administration 's program . The reporter 's question led directly into this line of reasoning : Would more GOP congressmen who o differed from the President in basic philosophy really strengthen the administration 's position in putting through a program ? And , further , would more dissenting Republicans in Congress actually assist the President in fixing responsibility for congressional action that blocked admin ; stration - blessed legislation ? At the end of the two-day session , the chairman of the Wisconsin GOP committee , Philip G. Kuehn , said at this point that his state had no funds available for the national ' 58 campaign . He said that the political climate  --  the opposition of Republicans in his state to the President 's budget  --  was a big factor in the low ebb of finances . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a big , $100-plate-banquet , scheduled for May 24 in the Milwaukee Arena , was being moved to the Pfister Hotel . Reason : The arena holds some 2.000 persons ; whereas the hotel holds from 500 to 800 . ! Conservatism Stressed I He pointed out that normally such a banquet , with Secretary j of Defense Charles E. Wilson as the chief speaker , would draw from 2,000 to 3,000 Republicans , " So , " he continued , " it looks as though we 'll only be able to get enough funds to carry the state committee for the next year . There wo n't be anything extra for the national committee . " The request made by the national committee to Wisconsin , incidentally , is for $57,000 . The Wisconsin tendency , Mr. Kuehn said , was toward " rock-bottom conservatism . The Republicans in my state have always looked upon the Republican Party as the party of prudence . If we do n't keep faith with the people , we 're going to be hurt . " Two other states , Indiana and Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slow coming . The Indiana GOP chairman , Robert W. Matthews , said that his state 's attitude on finances for the national campaign stemmed from lack of confidence in the President 's budget and from rumors that the national committee might be meddling in Indiana politics . Mr. Matthews was referring to rumors of a regional committee appointment in which he would not be consulted and to rumors of national plans to push Senator William E. Jenner out of his candidacy . Purpose Explained So while President Eisenhower , in traditional team fashion , was saying , " We want you " to GOP politicians in the Midwest , there were a lot of voices here that seemed to be saying , " We do n't want your budget , your foreign aid , your aid to education . " What , then , did this conference accomplish in terms of over-all Republican team gains ? A high GOP political official , whose allegiance to the President is complete and unalloyed , had an answer that scorned more realistic than the official appraisal : " Through the airing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , asking that his name be not used , " One of the reasons is to get the gripes out early , way ahead of the campaign . They 'll feel better if they can get all this off their chest . "
