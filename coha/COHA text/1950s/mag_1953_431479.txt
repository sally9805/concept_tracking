B ELT fastened tight ? " shouted Dr. Terris Moore above the sputtering of the airplane 's idling engine . I nodded . " Okay , here we go ! " Our little two-seated single-engine craft started bumping down the gravel runway of the airport at Chelatna Lake , 100 miles northwest of Anchorage , Alaska . In another moment we were off on an adventure which already had my heart pounding with mixed feelings of excitement and , I must admit , a certain amount of apprehension . Ahead of us , though invisible in a blanket of fog , towered the 20,300-foot snow-capped cone of mighty Mount McKinley , loftiest peak in North America . McKinley was named in 1896 for the Republican presidential nominee of that year by W. A. Dickey , who was prospecting in the vicinity . Long before , the Alaskan natives had called it , more appropriately , Denali , the Great One . It had been climbed only six times before our 1951 assault . Mountain Climbing by Airplane We were going to try what time after time had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( page 230 ) . More exciting still , we were going to try to do at least a third of the climb by airplane . To accomplish this , Terry Moore would have to land his tiny plane on the unexplored surface of Kahiltna Glacier . This huge ice river writhes down McKinley 's slopes between rock cliffs thousands of feet high . Our expedition had a threefold purpose : first , to test my theory that McKinley 's West Buttress actually offered a shorter , safer way to the top than the usual route up the northeast side ; second , to study the geology of this tremendous mass of rock ; and third , to do essential survey work for a new large-scale map of the area immediately around Mount McKinley . Part of this map is published for the first time in this issue of the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE ( pages 236-237 ) . Our undertaking was sponsored by the University of Denver , the University of Alaska , and Boston 's Museum of Science . McKinley 's distinction as our continent 's highest mountain alone would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the main feature of Mount McKinley National Park , which is attracting increasing numbers of visitors now that the famous Alaska Highway has made the country accessible by automobile . Important , too , is the fact that McKinley 's height and position , only 250 miles south of the Arctic Circle , make it an ideal laboratory for many kinds of scientific research . Arctic Equipment Tested Here During World War II three military expeditions used its high slopes to test clothing , equipment , and food for troops and plane crews operating in extremely cold climates . McKinley 's heights also provide a lookout for observing cosmic rays , which constantly bombard the earth from outer space . ' It furnishes a fine opportunity for weather observations , tests of the effect of a decrease in oxygen on the human body , and high-frequency radio research . It was to make this great natural laboratory easier to reach that we were seeking a better route to the top of McKinley and preparing a detailed map of its slopes and glaciers . Terry Moore , who was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only an experienced bush pilot but was also president of the University of Alaska ( he retired this summer ) . If we could land successfully , he was to leave me there with a small radio , camped on a smooth snow plateau . After this it should not prove too difficult to fly in to the glacier camp my first three companions , Dr. Henry Buchtel , James E. Gale , and Capt . William D. Hackett . With the radio I could tell them before they even took off what the weather was like at my end of the line . Kahiltna Glacier is one of the largest in the Alaska Range and one of the roughest . To help us find our way up it , we had with us a  | series of aerial photographs of Mount McKinley which I had taken for the National Geographic Society and Harvard University in 1936-38 , and 1947 and 1949 . Beneath us as we flew , the surface of the ice was at first so broken that nothing could possibly have landed there , not even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rock and gravel . Some boulders were as big as bungalows , piled helter-skelter in heaps more than a hundred feet high . Glittering Snow Peak Unveiled The valley walls , sheer rocky ridges , towered above us on both sides . We flew between a rough floor of glacial ice and a solid ceiling of dark , gloomy fog 2,000 feet above us . It was like flying through a gigantic tunnel . However , the cloud ceiling seemed nearly level , while the glacier climbed steadily . If the two met , we would be out of luck . Ahead , the valley made a sharp bend to the right . As we turned the rocky corner , a great rift split the clouds as if by magic . Before us soared the thrilling virgin peak of Mount Hunter , white beneath a mantle of fresh snow . Looking back , we could see the dark , evil tunnel from which we had just emerged . The valley floor below was now much higher , and a snow blanket covered the rough ice . We were flying about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to be 5,500 feet above sea level . Ahead the valley twisted abruptly to the left , the turn hiding the spot where we hoped to land . Every minute or two Terry swung the plane a bit so we could check our avenue of retreat . Until we sighted good landing snow we could not afford to let our black tunnel close up behind us . As we neared the turn , Kahiltna Glacier  | became a veritable cataract of ice , two miles of it so rough it would have been utterly impassable on foot except along its edges . Then the fickle weather took a turn for the worse . I glimpsed 17.395-foot Mount Foraker 's icy cone , known to natives as " Denali 's Wife . " towering up between masses of clouds . Then the mists rolled in and a solid wall of fog blotted out the valley ahead . Our progress blocked , we circled impatiently . Spotlighted to a Landing Without warning the break came . A tiny patch of blue sky appeared above , and a shaft of sunlight began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to land . We followed it . circling , for it was moving only half as fast as we were . As this " spotlight ' crossed the valley , we took our chance . The snow below us appeared perfect ? no bumps , no hollows , no crevasses . Terry Moore cut the throttle , lowered the flaps , and before I could believe it we were skimming the glacier . Then we settled for a perfect landing . No sooner were we down than the sun was gone again . It was 6 o'clock . exactly one hour from Chelatna . There was no time to lose . We pitched my supplies out on the soft snow , lifted the plane 's tail around , and faced the craft down the gentle slope . With a hasty handshake and a " So long , partner , " Terry climbed aboard . A roar and a swirl of snow and he was off . I heard the drone of the motor for a minute or two : then it died away , and I was alone , 7,700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close under McKinley 's flanks . It was so quiet I could hear my heart beat . It began to snow lightly . The rocky spurs faded into the fog , and everything about me on all sides , above and below , was white . An hour before I had been 40 miles away at Chelatna Lake : now here I was a third of the way up Mount McKinley : All this was possible because Terry Moore 's plane was equipped with aluminum skis that could be raised hydraulically above the wheels for take-off on the gravel at Chelatna Lake , then lowered for landing on the snow . A large shovel is a necessity in a glacier camp . With mine I had in half an hour a level spot dug out for my 7-by-7-foot tent . Meanwhile , I set snow melting over a gasoline stove . For a month our only fuel would  | be gasoline and our only source of water melted snow . Unfortunately , snow water is so flat in taste that drinking it is a real effort . Need More Liquids on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake of fluid to offset the dehydration that results from breathing deeply the extremely dry air . The need for liquids grew constantly more pressing the higher we climbed . We carried powdered fruit juice to dissolve in our water to make it more palatable , and also drank large quantities of frozen fruit juice dropped later by plane . After a bite to eat and some hot tea , I turned off the stove to save gasoline , even though the temperature was only 10 ? F. As its roar died , I was instantly greeted by the gentle patter of snow flakes on the tent . the total silence of the heights even feathery snowflakes make a perceptible sound falling on tent roofs . Poking my head out the draw string entrance , I was astonished to see the rocky cliffs of McKinley quite clearly , with Kahiltna Valley visible downward for at least five miles . The sun had disappeared behind the clouds , but the long twilight of the Alaskan summer still lingered . I busied myself marking our little airport with all available dark objects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no shadow , and the visibility is poor . Otherwise , everything appears an even , shapeless white . All depth perception is lost , and as a pilot nears the ground he has nothing with which to gauge his height . As the weather slowly cleared , I heard Terry faintly on my radio , talking to the Government station at Tal keetna , some 60 miles to the southeast : " This is N-1088-A , he was saying . " My position is now five miles north of Chelatna Lake , heading for camp on upper Kahiltna Glacier . " At 8:45 Terry 's voice boomed out loud and clear : " N-1088-A to KW034 . Can you see or hear me ? I 'm flying through drizzling snow about five miles below your camp . " He was on his way back with Henry Buchtel . I crawled out the door and looked down glacier behind the tent . There he was . I could barely hear the plane 's feeble little hum . I reported , " Landing conditions marginal , ceiling 300-500 feet , absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes later the little craft roared over camp and came to a perfect landing . This time the sky looked as if it were really going to snow in earnest . We unloaded Henry 's gear in a jiffy , and with a cheery  | " See you soon , " Terry was off again into the gathering gloom . Thirty minutes later we heard him report that he was preparing to land at Chelatna . Without his skill and determination as a bush pilot we could not have been where we were . Weather-bound on a Glacier The weather closed in tight , and Jim Gale and Bill Hackett were snowbound at Chelatna . The day Buchtel and I flew in , the last four members of our party , Dr. John Ambler , Dr. Melvin Griffiths , Jerry More . and Barry Bishop , were on the Alaska Railroad , riding from Anchorage to McKinley Park . 80 miles northeast of the mountain . The next day they were to drive to Wonder Lake , on the opposite side of the peak from us . While our 4-man team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carrying out our survey program , the others were to circle the mountain by pack train from the north , studying the geology as they progressed . They planned to meet us at base camp on June 30 ( pages 230 and 241 ) . McKinley 's core is a huge batholith , or mass. of granite , which oozed into place in the earth 's crust in molten form . It then cooled to form a beautiful pink crystalline rock , finally exposed at the surface by erosion of the crust . Near the top can be seen the point where the molten material met an overlying layer of black slate , once the bottom of a prehistoric sea . Earthquakes frequently shake McKinley , starting stupendous avalanches , but whether they represent the dying gasps of the forces that built the mountain or the beginning of new uplifts , no one knows . Red Sky at Midnight For two days Kahiltna Valley was buried beneath a dense sea of fog and drizzling snow . Then the skies cleared abruptly , and Terry Moore made two more swift relays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bill Hackett ( page 221 ) . Next day we worked until midnight breaking trail up the vast , smooth slopes of the  | glacier to Kahiltna Pass , 10,300 feet high . We were the first persons in history ever to set foot on this lofty , snow-covered saddle ( page 233 ) . Even at midnight the northern sky was still a deep red as twilight slowly merged into dawn . Between turns at the shovels. digging a firm base for our tent in the deep , loose snow in the pass , we stood catching our breath and looked up at the towering pink cliffs of McKinley . Massive granite walls of the West Buttress , more than a vertical mile above us. rose so near that they hid McKinley 's summit , 4,300 feet still higher and five miles farther away . The temperature was 9 ? above zero . Not the slightest sound broke the eerie silence of the heights except our voices and the steady thudding of the snow as we shoveled . On our first radio call we picked up the CAA station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge mass of Mount Hunter . The signals came through loud and clear . It was a great relief to know that our base camp was assured of reliable communication with the outside world . We asked Talkeetna to telephone the 10th Res- cue Squadron of the Alaskan Air Command in Anchorage . Tell them , we said , that our weather was perfect for the prearranged aerial drop of the equipment we had left with them . Scarcely had we crawled into our sleeping bags , it seemed , when a distant hum awakened us . It was 6:30 in the morning , the sun was high in the cloudless sky , and there , down the valley , was the approaching Air Force plane . Jim turned on the radio and at once picked up a voice : " Air Rescue to KW034 . . . Calling camp on Kahiltna Glacier ... Are you reading our signal ? " " KW034 to Air Rescue , " he replied . " We 're reading you loud and clear . " Back came the voice from the plane : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a call after we have finished the first drop and report how we did . " Supplies Hit Wrong Target As the big C-47 roared down only 200 feet above us , the pilot somehow missed the red cloth marker laid out on the snow 100 yards away . We realized with sudden horror that bundles and boxes flying out the open cargo door were streaking directly for our tent ! They showered around it , one making a deep crater less than five feet from the tent in which Jim Gale was talking on the radio . It was his own bag of personal equipment ! This near tragedy was over so quickly we scarcely realized what had happened . As the plane disappeared over the pass , Jim was yelling into the radio , " Hey , for heaven 's sake , watch where you 're throwing that stuff ! " Throw it at the marker , not the tent ! " " Mighty sorry , fellows , " came the reply as the plane circled beyond the pass and flew back toward us . " We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This time supplies came thudding down at a safe distance : tent poles , survey markers , a fresh king salmon , nylon rope , tent pegs , birch-wand trail markers , extra clothes , tents , and sleeping bags . Then came five loads of breakable supplies by parachute : radio batteries , film , an alarm clock , stove , gasoline , survey gear , even a small plywood sled . It had been a breath-taking half-hour . We had not yet had breakfast , but more than a ton of supplies had already been delivered at our front doorstep from a warehouse 130 miles away . In the old days it would have taken a 20-horse pack train and three wranglers weeks to move this load from Anchorage to the lower end of the Kahiltna Glacier , 44 miles below our camp . From there to where we sat , it would have been such a prodigious job of back packing to move these same supplies that we shuddered even at the thought . Included in the equipment dropped to us were 500 pounds of Birdseye frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave just outside our front door . Fortyeight loaves of bread , each packed in a paper bag , rained down all over our " lawn " ; they too were buried and frozen . We took loaves to bed with us when we wanted to thaw them out . On the trail we often carried small cans of frozen meat inside our clothing to thaw them for lunch Fats Indigestible at Altitude Our diet was strong in protein , which we got from lean frozen hamburg and ham . An ample supply of fresh vegetables and fruit helped us forget the almost total lack of fat in our diet at the highest camps . This was important to our efficiency on the mountain , for decrease in oxygen above 15,000 feet causes great difficulty in digesting fats . Members of the Parker-Browne expedition of 1912 , not realizing this , took quantities of pemmican , rich in energy but also very fatty . This diet caused them such acute distress above 15,000 feet that they could scarcely eat , lost strength , and unhappily had to turn back in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top . A few days after the supply drop we all set out to scale previously unclimbed " Peak Z , " a snow dome that rose southwest of camp . It was an easy climb up a rounded ridge buried under hundreds of feet of perpetual ice and snow . On top we built an igloo a few yards from our survey instrument so we could dodge in for shelter and a cup of hot tea when our fingers grew too cold to work the theodolite ( page 227 ) . Meanwhile , however , it grew absurdly warm , 40 ? F. in the sun , and we actually worked in our shirt sleeves . Jets Play Hide-and-Seek As we busied ourselves reading angles on the instrument , I heard a curious swooshing sound far off toward Mount McKinley . Above the tip of the great peak several tiny silver flies were playing hide-and-seek against the deep-blue sky . Then another appeared , and another and another , till we counted 10 little specks . They were jet fighter planes from Anchorage taking afternoon exercise above the monarch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching this extraordinary show , I was reminded of John Gillespie Magee , Jr . ' s inspiring poem , High Flight : I 've ... wheeled and soared and swung High in the sunlit silence . Hov'ring there , I 've chased the shouting wind along , and flung My eager craft through footless halls of air ... I 've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace , where never lark , or even eagle , flew .. . Two of the planes left the others and dived  | toward us at terrific speed . I took out a pocket mirror and flashed it as they swept by a mile or two away . One wheeled suddenly toward us , and I flashed him again as he passed between the sun and us . He wobbled his wings slightly , then headed away for a minute , apparently talking to his companion by radio . Planes Buzz Camp at 600 Miles an Hour Climbing almost .. out of sight , they turned lazily and headed back . Approaching at a staggering speed ? probably 600 miles an hour or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . We could clearly see the pilots waving . Gracefully they swung upward to the east . Barely a minute later they had rejoined their comrades , seven miles away and more than 8,000 feet above us . That effortless minute 's climb was soon to take us seven days and nights of nearly constant toil . As the afternoon wore on , black thunderheads over the lowlands to the north began to rumble ominously , and we saw gray streamers of rain pouring down beneath them into the darkened valleys below . A breeze broke the stillness , and , our survey done , we hesitated in front of the igloo , worried lest the storm catch us during our descent . The breeze grew to a wind , the wind to a gale , and then the storm hit us with terrific violence . We were far above the lightning and rain , but the crest of the turbulent mass of cloud flung a furious blizzard at us . We retreated into our igloo and at the very height of the howling tempest enjoyed a tranquil afternoon tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool and shady on a sunny day ; warm , cozy , and quiet in the wildest storm ; and it does n't flap in the wind . Constant flapping of our tents at night on previous trips had caused us to lose many hours of much-needed sleep . For an hour and a half the blizzard buffeted our retreat . Then , as suddenly as it came , the great cloud drifted peacefully off , the sun burst out , and the wind died down to a gentle breeze . Quiet Beauty Follows Blizzard As we started homeward , the fresh snow glittered all about us . Evening shadows reached across the western buttresses . To our left the emerald lowlands twinkled with myriad tiny lakes and streams reflecting the low rays of the sun . In the distance we could hear occasionally the rumble of avalanches . At base camp we spent several days in survey work for the new map of McKinley . This map began to take shape in 1945 during World War II , while I was a member of an Army Air Forces expedition on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency food , shelter , and clothing for use in the Arctic . To help pass the time , we had our supply plane drop us a surveyor 's transit to measure the angles between a number of points and to determine locations and heights of many unmapped peaks . Two years later , in 1947 , RKO Radio Pictures , Inc. , asked Boston 's Museum of Science to help obtain motion pictures of mountain scenery at high altitudes on Mount McKinley for use in a forthcoming film . At the same time they agreed to support our survey program and other scientific work there . In cooperation with us. an Air Force B-29 made vertical mapping photographs of the entire area from 32.500 feet , while we did ground survey work on McKinley 's upper slopes to tie the pictures together . The U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey lent us two powerful Zeiss theodolites . Surveying from McKinley 's North and South Peaks had been no joke . On the South Peak it was 20 ? below zero . Often a gust of wind bumped my face against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the observation all over again after making sure the instrument had not been thrown out of level and position . Surveying on Brink of Disaster The North Peak culminated in a narrow point of snow where there was barely room to clear away a level triangle three feet on a side to set up the theodolite . One careless step would have plunged me down the frightening Wickersham Wall , 14,000 feet high . In aerial mapping , two pictures of the same area are taken a few seconds apart . Viewed through a stereoscope , they appear as one , in three dimensions , with slopes , heights , and depths so vividly evident that accurate contour lines can be drawn directly from the photographs . Using all available data to fix positions and altitudes , and stereoscopic pictures for topography , the U. S. Geological Survey mapping office at Denver , Colorado , produced a map on a scale of 3.9 miles to the inch . The data to be obtained by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and a new Museum of Science party during 1953 , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several mile-to-the-inch quadrangle maps . Some of this mapping has already been done , and about 120 square miles of the central portion are shown on the map accompanying this article ( pages 236-237 ) . No complete large-scale map of Mount McKinley has ever been made before . On the evening of June 30 , while we were returning from a reconnaissance of McKinley 's  | lower slopes , we saw two infinitesimal specks approaching our camp 2.000 feet below . Behind them another pair of dots inched over the crest of Kahiltna Pass and started down the steep hill into camp . Our other four companions had arrived . An hour later we snowshoed in and found a reunion dinner already on the stove . It was actually only a few days since we had seen Mel , John , Jerry , and Barry , but somehow it seemed as if we had been separated for months . They had been drenched by our blizzardthunderstorm , plagued by swarms of bloodthirsty mosquitoes , and had almost lost a pack horse in a bottomless bog . Also , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them on the summit of 10,600-foot Peters Dome . which Barry and Jerry had climbed for the first time in history . Letter from Boston Only 3 Days Old Two days later . Terry Moore landed at our 10,100-foot-high camp and taxied off the " airstrip " right up to the cook tent with mail , film , and other supplies ; one of the letters had been mailed in Boston only three days before . This was the highest airplane landing ever made in Alaska up to that moment . As it turned out , it was safe enough for Terry to have landed here instead of lower on the glacier in the first place . But , not having checked ground conditions at the pass , we played it safe . Terry lingered while we read our mail and chatted over tea , jam , and crackers . Suddenly he exclaimed , " Good night ! It 's 5 o'clock . I have only two hours to get back to Fairbanks for a faculty meeting ! " His meeting was 160 miles away and 9,650 feet below us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jiffy he was off over the pass and out of sight . Later we learned he made it in plenty of time to shed his heavy clothes and parka , have a shower , and don a summer suit . Food sorted , survey work completed , and our party reunited , we focused our attention on Mount McKinley . The route by which we intended to breach its western barriers started just behind our camp . We had carefully planned it to avoid huge crevasses and avalanches , the two major dangers of the old route up the other side of the  | mountain . At first we followed the bottom of a broad hollow filled with hundreds of feet of drifted , wind-packed snow . When a big crevasse began to block our way , we climbed sharp slopes to the crest of the ridge which paralleled our route to the left . Actually we encountered only two crevasses , small in comparison to those on the northeast approach . Above , the grade was not steep , but in one place we struck a patch of bluegreen ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off our snowshoes and strap on iron creepers , or crampons . Three thousand feet above camp these snowand-ice slopes ended abruptly in a massive granite shoulder that rose with dramatic steepness 3,000 more feet to the 16,000-foot crest of McKinley 's great West Buttress . Here , in the very shadow of the cliff , we set up our first advanced camp . We had reconnoitered this route and marked it with birch wands stuck in the snow several days before . The entire 8-man party tackled it for the first time with 60- to 90-pound packs on the Fourth of July . A Night at " Windy Corner " As we struggled up to our camp site late that afternoon , the wind hissed through the granite ledges at our feet . The sky was gray with lowering mist . A sea of clouds filled the valleys below , and snowflakes were already beginning to fall . That night five of us stayed at " Windy Corner , " as we called it . Mel , Barry , and Jerry returned to base camp after hauling up three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue Mel 's geologic exploration several thousand feet below us , around the base of the upper peak . Camp was set on the snow about 100 feet from the rocky crest of Windy Corner so we could find snow blocks for building an igloo and a windbreak wall to protect our cook tent . We built a long tunnel entrance on the lee side of the igloo to help keep out the wind . There is no real shelter anywhere on this west side of McKinley . The big storms are almost always southwesters , which originate out toward the tip of the Aleutian Islands and strike the peak with tremendous violence . This route has one advantage , however : buffeting winds were at our backs instead of cutting our faces , as they do on the northeast side . After a cozy , peaceful night in our igloo , where our body heat and breathing kept the inside temperature up nearly to freezing , we had a real job digging our way out to breakfast . The entrance to our tunnel was drifted in solid with fresh snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roaring storm , with 60-miles-per-hour gusts , dense fog , and a wild blizzard . It took an hour to excavate the half-buried cook tent , retighten the guy ropes , and get inside . As John Ambler crawled into the tent , his beard white with frost and icicles. he said with some disgust , " This kind of climbing is about 90 percent trying to stay alive and warm , and only 10 percent climbing ! " Gale Blows 80 Miles an Hour A storm of increasing violence lashed camp all that day . We ventured out in relays during the afternoon and built another igloo. connecting it to the first one by a small doorway . By suppertime the gusts were hitting 80 miles an hour ( measured by anemometer ) , and the temperature was down to 14 above zero . Snow fell so thickly we could not see a thing . Luckily , it was blowing so hard the snow could not accumulate . It simply whirled off out of sight into the valley over the 2,000-foot cliff in front of camp . On July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This day and the next we carried a week 's supplies up to 14,000 feet . along a broad , gently sloping snow shelf at the side of the cliffs . Climbing higher , we tied knotted rope around our snowshoes to keep us from slipping backward on the steepening slope . Jim and I started ahead of the others and rapidly got into trouble . Here the snow from the recent storm lay drifted deep all up the hillside . At first we made fair headway with our 60-pound packs , but then we began to slide backward several inches at every step . I took off my snowshoes and promptly broke through the crust up to my waist . I put them on again , took the shovel out of my pack , and started carving large flat steps ahead of us . Then , at 15,000 feet , the slope steepened again and the surface snow was crusted just enough so that snowshoes would not hold on it . The spot where we wanted to make our next camp was still 1,000 feet above . Digging a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three days until wind and cold hardened the slope so we could walk on it without snowshoes , or shovel a trail up the mountainside to an ice shelf about 400 feet above . Our time was running short , and , also , it might snow again . We chose to shovel . When I got so tired I could n't lift another shovelful , Jim took a turn at it . After an hour 's work I looked back at my pack ; it was only 100 feet behind us . In another hour conditions began to improve . After that grueling uphill struggle we walked and slid back to our packs in about three easy minutes . We reached the 15,400- foot shelf at 2:45 p.m. , utterly exhausted and dripping with perspiration . Up there , three miles above the sea , we began to feel the insidious effects of anoxia , or deficiency of oxygen . Anoxia increasingly impairs a climber 's judgment , alertness , and will power the higher he gets . He becomes apathetic , careless , and tends to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worst of all , though he realizes his companions are affected by it , he is convinced that he himself is perfectly normal . Oxygen Lack Causes Errors Once in 1947 , when an Air Force plane dropped a load of supplies to us , I told them by radio that everything had landed all right . Actually one important box had smashed ; anoxia had made me too careless to walk around and check everything . Our writing became less legible , and we began to make elementary errors in arithmetic . For this reason we carefully double-checked our surveying figures . Once , because of anoxia , we set up the theodolite tripod so high I had to stand on tiptoe to see through it . And anoxia made me so apathetic that I used it in that awkward position and made several silly errors , which fortunately were corrected later . Anoxia 's ill effects can be reduced if a climber works slowly and rhythmically , without wasting energy . If , carrying a heavy pack , he chances to stumble , it is often better for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stubborn effort to retain his footing . There is no known cure for anoxia except bottled oxygen , which is far too heavy and clumsy to use on McKinley . So perfect was the weather that after a good lunch we goaded ourselves into action and tackled one of the real enigmas of McKinley 's west face ? the last steep slope leading to the crest of the West Buttress . It rose directly 600 feet above our shelf at an average angle of more than 60 ? ( measured by clinometer ) . The final obstacle , now also clearly in sight , was the broken , rocky crest of the ridge leading from the top of the 16,000-foot shoulder to a broad snow plateau at 17.200 feet . From there to the summit aerial photographs clearly showed no unusual difficulties ; simply 3,100 feet of steep , wind-packed snow slopes . The mountain face above our " Crow 's Nest " camp at 15,400 feet was in just as evil shape as the hill we had fought all morning a few hundred feet below . From 4 o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most wretched snow imaginable . On the surface there was a thin , breakable crust ; under it a layer of granular snow about like buckshot ; then another thin crust , then a few inches of powdery snow , and finally a solid mass of hard blue ice , all sloping much more than the average roof . We wore crampons and were tied to opposite ends of a 120-foot nylon rope . The man who was not chopping steps constantly watched the rope in case of a slip . Neither of us spoke . We just chopped and chopped . Below the top of the shoulder the going became so steep , and sandwiched layers of fluffy snow and thin ice so treacherous , that we cut off to the right and vainly tried to find better going in steep rock ledges . The wind was rising again , and , despite the fact that the ridge was now only a stone 's throw ahead , we decided to retreat to camp and return to our task in the morning . It is not wise to climb on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hungry . As we descended , we drove three 5-foot oak pegs into the snow and strung a length of sturdy hand line all the way down to camp . It was late that night before Jim , Bill , and I finished building an igloo beneath an overhanging ice cliff at the Crow 's Nest . Henry and John , after helping us carry up supplies , had returned to the Windy Corner camp . Knowing our time was limited , they generously agreed to let us go up first . They would follow us to the summit later . A furious westerly gale roared over camp all night . When we awoke , the sun was high and the wind had died to a breeze . Beautiful cirrus clouds topped the summits of McKinley , Foraker , and Hunter ( page 240 ) . We breakfasted and rested until noon , then tackled the big slope with 40-pound loads . What a contrast to our first trip ! Fresh drifted snow now filled our steps , but this was easy to brush away . We climbed upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each step . Looking 8,000 Feet Down In a scant hour we reached the top of the fixed rope . This time we were fresh and rested . Another hour of chopping brought us to firm rock , up which we scrambled easily to the very crest of the great West Buttress . Peering over its other side , we looked almost straight down 8.000 feet to the upper basin of Peters Glacier . The ridge ahead was a granite knife edge , studded with angular boulders . As we neared 17,000 feet , the grade lessened and the rock changed abruptly from granite to slate at the geologic contact between the peak 's granite core and the inky-black cap rock . The wind blew on our backs in gusts of 30 to 40 miles an hour . in the lulls we could hear the gale roaring through the jagged ledges of the North Peak , half a mile away .  | As we topped the final crag of the ridge , a level snow field stretched ahead to the foot of Denali Pass . The weather was worsening . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we dared not linger long in this desolate and exposed spot . We cached our loads and weighted them down with rocks , then hurried back down the ridge , collecting rock specimens set aside on the way up . Next morning , we climbed back up with 55-pound loads . The clouds grew so dense that when we reached our 17,200-foot cache it was impossible to see 100 feet ahead . We had to push on to find firm snow for building our last igloo . After 15 minutes of aimless groping we found ourselves back near our cache . We had walked in a circle . Lining up our direction with the rocks . I poked one of the birch trail markers into the snow 50 feet out from the edge of the ledges , then proceeded to the end of the rope . Jinn beckoned me a bit to the right until I was in line with the first wand . Then I stuck in another . An hour later , surveying ourselves forward across the plateau through the dense fog , we saw sharp chunks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKinley 's final cone . This was the spot we had chosen for our last camp site , at 17,300 feet . Suddenly a patch of blue appeared overhead , our shadows became visible on the snow , and the clouds cleared away like magic . Hours later . as the sun slipped behind the great cliffs of the North Peak , a sea of golden clouds filled all the valleys below us . Only Denali and Denali 's Wife rose above them like two enormous islands ( page 244 ) .  | July 10 dawned without a cloud . When I crawled out of the igloo tunnel to check the weather at 8 a.m. , it was 10 ? above zero with a brisk south breeze ; yet inside it was 25 ? above . We ate breakfast hurriedly and set aside things needed for a trail lunch . Today packs would be light ? only the inevitable extra clothing , a good supply of trail markers. food , cameras , and film . Off for the Summit As we hoped . the last 1,000-foot slope leading to Denali Pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ice in some places by the winds . just after noon the grade suddenly lessened . we began to see familiar ledges , and a shapeless bundle appeared ahead . I gave a shout of joy . This was the cache of cosmic ray apparatus that was left there by our 1947 expedition , which had climbed the other side of Mount McKinley . It was still neatly covered with the yellow rayon cargo parachutes with which it had been dropped to us by the 10th Rescue Squadron four years before . We ran toward the cache but , panting and puffing , had to slow our pace at once . Finally we reached it , out of breath and speechless . We shook hands heartily . At long last McKinley 's western face had been climbed ' We noticed a shovel lying in the snow a hundred yards east of the pass . As Jim walked over to it , Bill and I went to a near-by spot where we had left a large cache of food , fuel , and equipment at the close of the 1947 expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion met our eves . The party which had climbed McKinley in 1948 , probably in desperate need of supplies , had ripped off the tents and parachutes with which we had covered the cache , and left it unprotected . Snow and ice , driven by screaming gales , had penetrated every crack and cranny . The whole heap was frozen into a solid , rigid mass . Only about a third of the supplies remained . In a near-by pile of rocks we found the American Alpine Club 's minimum-recording thermometer , also left there in 1947 . It registered 59 ? below zero , the coldest temperature since it was last adjusted , presumably in 1948 . Actually this was a surprisingly warm record for that altitude , 18,200 feet . Suddenly Jim leaned over with an exclamation and picked up a tiny bird , a little redpoll , which lay frozen dead in a crack between the rocks . In 1947 we had found another redpoll and a Lapland longspur near the pass in the same condition . Every year thousands of these migrating birds must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm spring gales . Though our main objective had been attained , one goal still beckoned . All three of us had stood on the summit of McKinley before ; yet we now had a compelling desire to climb to that snowy crest just once more . To the Tiptop of a Continent A plumelike cloud coursed over the tip of the peak , but we knew it would vanish in the chill of late afternoon . As we climbed , the cloud dropped lower , and at 19,000 feet we were inching forward through dense fog . But now that we knew the way , every undulation of the snow was like a familiar tree or signpost , for McKinley 's upper dome changes scarcely at all from year to year . At 5 p. m. the clouds melted away , and the summit of McKinley rose directly ahead , magnificent in a fresh coat of silver frost . We worked upward over the corniced drifts , fingers numb from taking pictures . Forty-five minutes later we topped the final drift of McKinley 's South Peak , and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost cloudless in every direction . Mount Hayes , sharp and clear , cut the horizon 140 miles to the east . To the southeast lay the Chugach Mountains and the misty gray haze which we knew must hide Cook Inlet and Anchorage . The huge white masses of the Kahiltna and Muldrow Glaciers wound toward the lowlands through a staggering sea of jagged peaks . Most impressive of all was the deep emerald green of the lowlands to south and west . River after river sparkled in the afternoon sun , twisting off into the distance . As Archdeacon Hudson Stuck said after his first ascent of McKinley 38 years before , it was like looking out the very windows of heaven . As it grew later , the temperature dropped rapidly below zero , and the gusty wind cut our faces like a knife . Despite heavy clothing we began to feel the intense burning cold of great altitude . Panorama of 100,000 Square Miles Yet we hated to leave . Each of us knew he might never see this marvelous sight again , a cloudless panorama stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of Alaska visible in a single sweeping glance ! At 6:15 we tied a bit of orange bunting to the tip of the 8-foot bamboo survey marker that still remained on the summit from our 1947 trip ( pages 246 and 247 ) . Then we headed downward to our last igloo , shivering uncontrollably from the bitter cold . Descending next day , even with heavy packs , was almost pathetically easy compared with the rigors of the long and grueling ascent . On the trail we passed the other members of our party in two groups , upward bound in high spirits . On July 13 and 14 they too reached the summit . We went to bed at midnight in Kahiltna Pass , making the entire retreat from our highest camp in a single day . But our thrills were not quite all behind us . We radioed to Terry Moore that the vanguard of the party was ready to be flown out , and he replied , " Will come this evening . " The sun had dropped behind Kahiltna Pass when we heard a faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two minutes later , Terry was taxiing safely toward the tents . " Gee , that was a tough one ! No more landings tonight ! " were his first words as he climbed out . " The camp looked as if it were floating in a bottomless sea of gray milk . I 'll take only one man out tonight . " It was agreed that I would go on the first trip . It was a thrilling take-off . High clouds aflame with sunset covered the sky . Every peak about us was pink with alpine glow . Back to the Soft , Fresh Lowlands I caught a final glimpse of Jim 's and Bill 's worried faces as we started moving . We passed the end of the runway and headed down the steep , smooth snow slope of the glacier . Suddenly I realized we were in the air . Terry 's eyes twinkled triumphantly . " We made it , pard ! " he shouted . The sun was slipping behind the vast Yukon lowlands to the northwest as we flew over Wonder Lake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget the lush green of that valley , the beauty of the spruces , and the smell of grass and flowers that came in the plane windows even before we touched the ground . The whole world down there seemed soft , fresh , and delicious after the cold , icy desolation of the heights . At daybreak on July 13 Bill and Jim were flown safely out , and 10 days later the others followed . McKinley had been climbed from the west , safely and speedily , in only seven days from Kahiltna Pass . We had proved that airplanes , loaded or unloaded , could land and take off halfway up that side of the peak . Mel Griffiths had completed his geologic work . My survey was done and checked . Not even a minor accident had occurred . Our new route up McKinley 's " impregnable " western face had turned out to be even shorter than I had hoped it might be when I had first seen it on our NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC photographic flights 15 years before . It was proved to be an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North America .  |
