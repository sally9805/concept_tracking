This Winter 's Events Fix the Goal and Plot the Course <P> THE biggest news in the world today is that the U.S. has acquired a positive policy to combat Communism . The goal is becoming clear , the basic decisions have been taken and a strategic outline for the free world set . <P> These decisions are not contained in any official speech or congressional action or secret military report . They were made as democracies usually make high policy in times of crisis : the people get ahead of their leaders ; acceptance precedes proposal ; operation outruns plan ; event shapes intent . <P> In its issue of Jan. 15 , TIME noted ( " Giant in a Snare " ) that the misnamed " Great Debate " had gotten tangled in pessimistic , defensive perimeters and loops . But events and decisions were already on the march , and the " Great Debate " petered out like a story told by a man who gradually realizes that nobody is listening . <P> <P> Policy from Below <P> At what is supposed to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But a lot of policy got made . <P> In December , the Pentagon generals were saying that nothing could be done until somebody else ( not they ) decided whether the U.S. Army would try to stay in Korea . They were waiting for a clear-cut directive from the White House . It never came . Yet a firm decision was made , largely by the ist Marine Division . When the marines fought their way down to Hungnam through the " unconquerable Chinese hordes , " and embarked for Pusan with their equipment , their wounded and their prisoners , the war in Asia took on a different look . The news stories , pictures and newsreels of the Hungnam action contributed more to forming U.S. policy than all the words in the " Great Debate . " The nation-and the revitalized Eighth Army-now knows that U.S. fighting men will stay in Korea until a better place and a better opportunity is found to punish Communist aggression . <P> A proposal to send more U.S. troops to Europe is supposedly under discussion . Actually , that decision was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his survey . Modestly but unmistakably , Ike said what the U.S. had to do . When no outcry against it arose , the argument was over . <P> Meanwhile , other events have been shaping policy . America 's allies look a lot better than they did when winter began . Again &; again , in the Korea news , highly honorable mention of British , Greek , Turkish , Dutch , French units bobs up . At Lake Success , after weeks of discouraging debate , the U.S. delegation pressed its reluctant friends to a vote . Forty-four nations supported the U.S. resolution , against seven , a sign that strong leadership will bring a strong response . In Indo-China , a single man , General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny , by an act of will , stopped the rot that undermined resistance to Communism . <P> <P> Shackles from the Past <P> Recent weeks have brought reminders that the enemy is vulnerable . Vladimir Clementis , a dedicated Communist since his youth and Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakia only two years ago , fled from Prague . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the simple issue of the defense of Italy if Russia attacked their country . This question has been present since 1945 ; the pressure of crisis brought it home , thereby split Red ranks .
