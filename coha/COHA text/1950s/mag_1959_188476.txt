In racially embattled Little Rock , a prime point of interest last week was a religious conversion . Not long ago , Clothing Dealer Jimmy Karam was a pal of Governor Faubus , a segregationist leader of the 1957 riots at Central High School ; during last fall 's elections , he faked an inflammatory picture of a Negro family agitating for " equality " ( TIME , Oct. 6 ) . But now invective ( " lying bastards , gutless s.o.b.s . " ) is gone from his lips . He holds court in his Main Street store , telling all comers that " only Jesus is important . If everybody could take Jesus to their hearts , there would be no problems in the world . " <P> Jimmy Karam was born and reared a Roman Catholic , but had given up his religion long ago . He smoked , drank and played the horses . Worse , he tried to drag Christians down . " I used to say to a Christian , ' I got a pot of money and a bottle of whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broads and go down to Hot Springs for the weekend . ' Oh friend , that was so wrong ! " <P> This was the period when Jimmy belonged to the segregationist high command , but early this year his daughter Mary Ann , 16 , invited him to attend a meeting at her Immanuel Baptist Church , whose minister is intelligent , reasonable , nonsegregationist Dr. W. O. Vaught Jr . " I never asked her about it , " says Jimmy , " but I imagine Mary Ann went to him and said , ' Dr. Vaught , you 've never talked to my daddy about coming to church , ' and he probably said , ' Mary Ann , your daddy is an evil man . ' If he did ( she 's a sweet child ) , Mary Ann said , ' No , he 's not . My daddy 's a good man . ' " <P> Last April Dr. Vaught called at Jimmy 's store , gave him a Bible ( " The first New Testament I ever saw , " says Jimmy ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting , Jimmy was converted , joined Immanuel Baptist Church and broke with his segregationist cronies-but refuses to say whether or not he himself is still a segregationist . " I have n't seen one of those men , " he says , " since I accepted Jesus as my Saviour . " He also gave up smoking , drinking and joyrides in Cadillacs . <P> How does he feel about his past rabble-rousing at Central High School ? " I am positive of this , " he says . " Our only problem is working for Jesus to help other persons become Christians . I have no hatred for anyone . We should get people on both sides to really accept Christ . " <P> During Evangelist Billy Graham 's visit to Little Rock last week , Jimmy was among his most prominent local sponsors , sat with him at press conferences and on the platform . Summed up one Little Rock reporter : " Many church people are convinced that it 's the greatest conversion since Paul of Tarsus . Others still see Jimmy Karam under the sheep 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
