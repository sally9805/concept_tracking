Behind the speech writer is the slogan maker . And behind the slogan maker is the researcher . Researchers are often nameless creatures , but they are the molders of political action . Some researchers are nimble analysts for national political committees , concerned less with fresh ideas than with arrangements of facts to fit prevailing prejudices . Some researchers are career government workers preparing thousands of typewritten pages on private power , or federal aid to school construction , or highway construction , to be passed upward to a Douglas McKay or a Marion Folsom or a Sindair Weeks . And at this political altitude the research reports are cut up with scissors , some data going in the wastebasket and some into political speeches . But there is another kind of researcher , perhaps even more important than these . He is the researcher having no connection with a political party or even the government , a man who receives a non-profit grant to delve into an issue of government as a public service . But because the bias of the researcher , or his economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major political parties , this man is acclaimed a prophet . He may thus add new ideas to the public scene , or stimulate action on ideas long known but dormant . Every four years this business of research on public issues reaches the status of a great industry . It is a recognized cycle which guides foundations in their research grants and enables university departments to augment their research funds . And it has its political customers . Every candidate for public office is looking for ready-made speech materials . If by good fortune a timely research report is at hand from a reputable scholar , reflecting the bias of the political party and lending itself to sloganeering , such a research report will find extraordinary demand in the political marketplace . All this bears on the 1956 farm issue and the recent outpouring of research reports on the subject . Until very recently little creative thought had been given to the farm problem in more than a decade . The Brannan - plan represented a fresh approach in the late ' 40s , but for the most part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The new Republican Administration set out ' to remedy this in 1953 . A Republican Congress held hearings for a full year and consulted what it called the best . minds . When it completed the Agricultural Act of 1954 , it tinkered with a few things but did , not come to grips with the root causes of falling farm income , chronic , poverty among the lowest third of farm- ers , shrinking farm exports , underconsumption of foodstuffs by low income groups at home , and the surplus of both acres and farmers in American agriculture . Both parties were waiting for researchers . Now the orators have been blessed with fresh thoughts on the farm question . Some-thinking comes from lone wolves like Senator Paul Douglas of Illinois or Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota , each of whom has employed a first-rate economist on his staff to work on farm proposals . Some fresh thoughts come from reputable private research organizations like the National Planning Association , which issued a 30-page report on November 14 from its . Agricultural Committee . This NPA committee is made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , but the views of the committee members proved so diverse that the value of the report seems lost among the 29 footnotes of dissent . There are two recent research efforts which deserve more careful attention because each is prepared br acknowledged technicians in the economic field , and each seems ready-made for Republican and Democratic slogan makers as they ' sharpen their pencils for ' 56 . DECEMBER 19 , 1935 On December 5 the Twentieth Century Fund issued a 600-page book entitled Can Ire Solve the Farm Problem ? This publication is the result of four years of research by a group of scholars headed by Dr. Murray R. Benedict at the Giannini Foundation , University of California . The volume is devoted largely to an historical account of American farm programs , with special emphasis on recent price supports and mounting surpluses . The book concludes with a 50-page policy statement by a 12-man Committee named by the 20th Century Fund to review the volume . Both the Fund and Prof. Benedict may be pardonably incensed to have their meticulous scholarship , which began in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign document . Yet the fact is that the economic bias of the book ? its reverence for the free market , its rapier thrusts at gov ernment planning , government controls , and government subsidies , its inherent contempt for the farmer who does n't stand on his own feet ? are a slogan-writer 's dream if he 's attached to Republican headquarters . A NOTHER volume issued November 27 by the Confer- ' ence on Economic Progress , Washington , D. C. , is no less a windfall for Democratic speechwriters . In fact many of the ideas of this 108-page pamphlet with the apple-green cover were incorporated by Gov . Averell Harriman of New York into his recent farm-policy speech at Des Moines , and have appeared in other speeches by Democratic leaders . The Conference on Economic Progress is a non-profit research group best identified with its director , Leon Keyserling , formerly chairman of the President 's Council of Economic Advisers under President Truman . His National Committee includes James G. PattOn , President of the National . Farmers Union ; Walter P. Reuther , president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Machinists , AFL ; and a number of liberal businesimen . Despite its condensation into pamphlet length , the Keyserling report is the more comprehensive in scope , It places agriculture in the context of the national economy , describes the whole range of farm problems , comments on the full gamut of temedies , and concludes with a set of goals which a new ' arm program should ' achieve by the end of 1960 . Both the Benedict and Keyserling reports lapse into ; argon , which makes for slow reading . Both reports have the ideology , or even theology , of their respective schools . Neither will be a best seller , although farm , labor , business and educational organizations have already purchased 17,000 copies of the Keyserling report . Taken together the two reports represent the underlying clash of philosophy between the Republican and Democratic parties on farm policy , though both are more extreme than either party is likely to endorse in the 1956 Congress . The Benedict book will commend itself to Republican campaigners because of two particular stresses : excessive federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commodity adjustment , not a human adjustment . " Despite twenty billion dollars spent by the federal government in the past two decades for agricultural aid , our farm problems have not been solved . . . " That is the opening sentence in the press release by the 20th Century Fund . Offhand , that looks like a typographical error . But it is n't . In the back of Mr. Benedict 's book are 16 pages of tables on farm program costs , supplied appropriately by Mr. Benson 's Department . They start with the relatively small sum lost by the government on commodity loani over the , past 22 years , but add to it the following : More than $7 billion now invested in commodities which are being sold , nearly $5 billion in national conservation payments over the 22-year period , nearly $2 billion in loans for rural electrification , rural telephones , and individual farmer credit , more than $1 billion in agricultural research including such scientific breakthroughs as the control of undulant fever germs in city-distributed milk , and nearly $2 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Department of Agriculture . These and a few other . items , the 20th Century Fund states , add up to $20 billion spent on an unsolved farm problem . One could comment with equal accuracy that we have spent ten times that amount on national security during the 22-year period , and the ' security problem is ' still unsolved . Editor Benedict associates himself with this emphasis on federal costs when he states : " The pertinent questions are whether they the farmers need the amounts now being spent on their behalf , and whether the programs now in effect are workable and in their interest . " Nowhere in the Benedict book will the reader find an awareness that farmers are people , that farmers have the same aspirations for family security and a chance to send their children to college that city people have . Instead one reads about " Wheat Problem Not Wholly One of Prices , " " Cotton Presents a Different Set of Problems , " " Competition from Synthetics . " One gets the feeling Mr. Benedict is a corporation executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers as an economic group , he makes a disparaging comparison . Businessmen , he says , pay for their own research , and labor absorbs its own " surplus " by individual unemployment ; but farmers pass the check for both to the federal treasury . That is stating the point more concisely than Mr. Benedict does on page 434 , but is not unfair to his conclusion . There is a wealth of factual material in the boOk , to which none of these critical comments apply . But it is the ideology that makes this book Mr. Benson 's baby . In fact , eight of Mr. Benson 's subordinates are acknowledged in the preface as contributors . Mr. Keyserling in his booklet leaves the reader in no doubt about his ideology . A basic philosophy is what he stresses most , and only against this ' backdrop does he believe a remedy for the farm problem can be worked out . DECEMBER 19 , 1955 expenditures . A combination of ' expanding national economy , and government technical assistance , should team up to move these families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch and milk programs would also ? speed up absorption of existing surpluses . The increased export of AMerican farm products by dumping will be self-defeating , Mr. Keyserling believes , but over the next five years a substantial increase of exports can be achieved through larger foreign investment , larger purchase of foreign goods in America , and larger foreign aid , especially loans . The effect of all these steps is to build:up dollar purchasing power in other , countries . 2 . Farm income is too low , and must be raised in relation to city income . The average farm family in 1955 will net $3250 while the average nonfarm fatnily will receive $6750 . If one takes a year of peak agricultural prosperity , say 1947 , the , average farm family netted $4059 while the city family was , receiving $5476 . In other words , the farmer at the peak of prosperity never approached the city man in income , and now the . farm family has slipped to an income level less than half that of the city . ( All figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a problem . More than 600,000 farm families have incomes continuously below $1000 a year . They are the chronically poor , selling little , contributing nothing to surpluses , benefiting not at all from government price supports . Only rehabilitation into nonfarm employment can remove them from degradation . For the commercial farmer , on the other hand , Mr. Keyserling proposes that the system of government crop adjustments be based upon farmer income , not upon commodity price supports . In effect he rejects both the Democratic 90-percent price supports and the Republican flexible supports , feeling that neither can assure stable income for the farmer . 3 . The human adjustment ? that is , helping people to leave the land or to move from small uneconomic farms to larger acreage ? requires government help and must be undertaken as an integral part of the farm program . Movement , off the land would involve retraining , loans , and employment services . Movement to larger farms would require loans and technical services . 4 . National farm production must be adjusted to meet a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a rising standard of living . Mr. Keyserling offers a specific set of goals for 1960 ? for example , red meat consumption would be up 21 percent , wheat up 8 percent , tobacco down 4 percent . These are not arbitrary figures but calculations derived from population estimates and known American eating habits at different Im'els of prosperity . Mr. Keyserling suggests these goals can be attained , without serious overproduction , through a system of price supports , income payments , and payments to withdraw land from crop use . Having outlined his system , the author concludes with a " National Prosperity Budget for Agriculture " in 1960 which includes among its targets such actions as these : Raise total ' American farm income from about . $11 billion in 1955 to about $21 billion in 1960 . Even such a gain will give the average farmer only two-thirds the family income of a city man . , Lift six out of seven farm families now making ? less than $1000 into the next higher income bracket ? that is , between $1000 and $2000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farm , arrange withdrawal of 8.5 million acres from production , and bring about the merger of a million small farms having less than 50 acres . What would this " farm prosperity budget " cost ? About $2 billion in 1960 , Mr. Keyserling estimates , the " cost " being the het loss on commodity price supports and total farm income . payments . The cost in the transitional years 1956-59 would be somewhat higher . Economists may quarrel with some of Mr. Keyserling 's estimates ? notably his calculation of a 24-percent increase in food consume - ? tion by 1960 . Rural sociologists may shake their . heads that six out of seven of the chronically poor can be retrained for a better livelihood . And the report is certainly sketchy in how all these goals are to be attained . But Mr. Keyserling has already attained his main goal , which was to stimulate fresh thinking on the farm question , and particularly to focus , attention on the need to measure income , not commodity prices , as the ultimate measure of the success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Keyserling findings are likely to have great influence upon a Congress which is in session during an election year . Mr. ? Beneclict 's essentially negative attitude toward government supports ? is widely divergent from the near panic felt in the Republican Party over the possible loss of the farm vote . And Mr. Keyserling is equally wide ' of the Democratic Party in the degree of-government manipulation he pr'oposei . Yet there is building up in both parties a feeling of urgency about the farm issue . A report of this sort tends to move party thinking in its direction , even though a la.ige part of the proposals may be dropped in Congressional debate . Perhaps Mr. Benson had this , in mind when ' he told . the Republican National Committee on December 1 , five days after Keyserling 's report was released : " I doubt that it American agriculture can survive the witch 's brew now being stirred up in Democratic cauldrons.
