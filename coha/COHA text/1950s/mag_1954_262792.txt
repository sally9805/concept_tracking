Landing at Caracas ' Maiqueta Airport this week for the Tenth Inter-American Conference , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles told a welcoming crowd of officials and newsmen : " I know that the climate here , not only physically but also in terms of our conference atmosphere , will be much more temperate than that of Berlin . We have our problems . . . but we discuss them as friends . " <P> Stop the Reds . The chief problem that Dulles wanted to discuss with Latin American friends at Caracas was Communist infiltration in the hemisphere , notably in Guatemala . To the U.S. , the ever-growing influence of Communists in a republic midway between the U.S. and the Panama Canal is intolerable . Since it is pledged to the principle of nonintervention in individual countries ' affairs , the U.S. can deal with this threat to American security only by joint action with the other republics . At Caracas , Dulles is expected to press for a full-dress debate on a U.S. resolution condemning Red penetration anywhere in the continent ; the resolution will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trends will no doubt be well aired in the debate . Then the U.S. may seek pledges for effective action against Communist travel between countries , propaganda in hemisphere mails , influence in labor unions and traffic in contraband arms . <P> That is a large order , because few Latin American diplomats see the dangers of world Communism . Their inclination is to shrug off Communism as a local problem , and some even sympathize privately with Guatemalan Foreign Minister Guillermo Toriello 's charge that the U.S. is being outrageously interventionist . <P> Help the Neighbors . The Latin Americans are far more excited about economic issues-i.e. , what they can get out of the U.S. They want assurances that the U.S. will grant more loans and technical aid . quit complaining about high coffee prices , promise to hold down tariffs , give them some sort of parity price program for their raw materials . Some U.S gesture-an announcement , for instance , that the U.S. Export-Import Bank would reconsider the decision against making further Latin American development loans-may be necessary in this atmosphere if Dulles is to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably go on for at least a month , Dulles will have to work fast ; he plans to stay only a week or ten days . This week the conference got slowly under way at Caracas ' spanking new University City with a welcoming speech by Venezuela 's President Marcos Prez Jimnez . Topic A the first day was not conference business at all but the Puerto Rican Nationalists ' attack on U.S. Congressmen in Washington ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) .
