been surprised at that . What they had expected him to gravitate to was one of the small violent irreconcilable nonconformist non-everything and - everybody else which existed along with the regular prison religious establishment in probably all Southern rural penitentiaries  --  small fierce cliques and groups ( this one called themselves Jehovah 's Shareholders ) headed by self-ordained leaders who had reached prison through a curiously consistent pattern : by the conviction of crimes peculiar to the middle class , to respectability , originating in domesticity or anyway uxoriousness : bigamy , rifling the sect 's funds for a woman : his wife or someone else 's or , in an occasional desperate case , a professional prostitute . " I did n't need no church , " he said . " I done it in confi-dence . " " In confidence ? " the Warden said . " Yes , " he said , almost impatiently . " You do nt need to write God a letter . He has done already seen inside you long before He would even need to bother to read it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even outside . But he learns it quick in here . That when a Judgment powerful enough to help you , will help you if all you got to do is jest take back and accept it , you are a fool not to . " " So He will take care of Stillwell for you , " the Warden said . " Why not ? What 's He got against me ? " " Thou shalt not kill , " the Warden said . " Why did n't He tell Houston that ? I never went all the way in to Jefferson to have to sleep on a bench in the depot jest to try to buy them shells , until Houston made me . " " Well I 'll be damned , " the Warden said . " I will be eternallydamned .

" So when it was only October , no holiday valentine or Christmas card month that he knew of , when the Warden sent for him , he was not even surprised . The Warden sat looking at him for maybe half a minute , with something not just aghast but almost respectful in the look , then said : " I will be damned . " It was a telegram this time . " It 's from the Chief of Police in San Diego , California . There was a church in the Mexican quarter . They had stopped using it as a church , had a new one or something . Anyway it had been deconsecrated , so what went on inside it since , even the police have n't quite caught up with yet . Last week it fell down . They do nt know why : it just fell down all of a sudden . They found a man in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telegram says : Fingerprints F.B.I . identification your man Number 08213 Shuford H. Stillwell . ' " The Warden folded the telegram back into the envelope and put it back into the drawer . " Tell me again about that church you said you used to go to before Houston made you kill him . " He did n't answer that at all . He just drew a long breath and exhaled it . " I can go now , " he said . " I can be free . " " Not right this minute , " the Warden said . " It will take a month or two . The petition will have to be got up and sent to the Governor . Then he will ask for my recommendation . Then he will sign the pardon . " " The petition ? " he said . " You got in here by law , " the Warden said . " You 'll have to get out by law . " " A petition , " he said . " That your family will have a lawyer draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your wife  --  but that 's right , she 's dead . One of your daughters then . " " Likely they done married away too by now . " " All right , " the Warden said . Then he said , " Hell , man , you 're already good as out . Your cousin , whatever he is ,  |p102right  there in Jackson now in the legislature  --  Egglestone Snopes , that got beat for Congress two years ago ? " He did n't move , his head bent a little ; he said , " Then I reckon I 'll stay here after all . " Because how could he tell a stranger : Clarence , my own oldest brother 's grandson , is in politics that depends on votes . When I leave here I wont have no vote . What will I have to buy Clarence Snopes 's name on my paper ? Which just left Eck 's boy , Wallstreet , whom nobody yet had ever told what to do . " I reckon I 'll be with you them other three years too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Warden said . " I 'll write the letter for you . " " Hub Hampton that sent me here is dead . " " You 've still got a sheriff , have n't you ? What 's the matter with you ? Have forty years in here scared you for good of fresh air and sunshine ? " " Thirty-eight years this coming summer , " he said . " All right . Thirty-eight . How old are you ? " " I was born in eighty-three , " he said . " So you 've been here ever since you were twenty-five years old . " " I do nt know . I never counted . " " All right , " the Warden said . " Beat it . When you say the word I 'll write a letter to your sheriff . " " I reckon I 'll stay , " he said . But he was wrong . Fivemonths later the petition lay on the Warden 's desk . " Who is Linda Snopes Kohl ? " the Warden said . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paw'sa rich banker in Jefferson . His and my grandpaw had twosets of chillen . " " She was the member of your family that signed the petition to the Governor to let you out . " " You mean the sheriff sent for her to come and sign it ? " " How could he ? You would n't let me write the sheriff . " " Yes , " he said . He looked down at the paper which he could not read . It was upside down to him , though that meant nothing either . " Show me where the ones signed to not let me out . "  | " What ? " the Warden said . " The ones that do nt want me out . " " Oh , you mean Houston 's family . No , the only other names on it are the District Attorney who sent you here and your Sheriff , Hubert Hampton , Junior , and V. K. Ratliff . Is he a Houston ? " " No , " he said . He drew the slow deep breath again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing more , " the Warden said . " Your luck 's not even holding : it 's doubling . " But he handled that too the next morning after they gave him a pair of shoes , a shirt , overalls and jumper and a hat , all brand new , and a ten-dollar bill and the three dollars and eighty-five cents which were still left from the forty dollars Flem had sent him eighteen years ago , and the Warden said , " There 's a deputy here today with a prisoner from Greenville . He 's going back tonight . For a dollar he 'll drop you off right at the end of the bridge to Arkansas , if you want to go that way . " " Much obliged , " he said . " I 'm going by Memphis first . I got some business to tend to there . " It would probably take all of the thirteen dollars and eighty-five cents to buy a pistol even in a Memphis pawn shop . He had planned to beat his way to Memphis on a freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , as he had once or twice as a boy and a youth . But as soon as he was outside the gate , he discovered that he was afraid to . He had been shut too long , he had forgotten how ; his muscles might have lost the agility and co-ordination , the simple bold quick temerity for physical risk . Then he thought of watching his chance to scramble safely into an empty car and found that he did n't dare that either , that in thirty-eight years he might even have forgotten the unspoken rules of the freemasonry of petty lawbreakingwithout knowing it until too late . So he stood beside the paved highway which , when his foot touched it last thirty-eight years ago , had not even been gravel but instead was dirt marked only by the prints of mules and the iron tires of wagons ; now it looked and feltp104as smooth and hard as a floor , what time you could see it or risk feeling it either for the cars and trucks rushing past on it . In the old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his raised hand . But these were not wagons so he did n't know what the new regulations for this might be either ; in fact if he had known anything else to do but this he would already be doing it instead of standing , frail and harmless and not much larger than a child in the new overalls and jumper still showing their off-the-shelf creases and the new shoes and the hat , until the truck slowed in toward him and stopped and the driver said , " How far you going , dad ? " " Memphis , " he said . " I 'm going to Clarksdale . You can hook another ride from there . As good as you can here , anyway . " It was fall , almost October , and he discovered that here was something else he had forgotten about during the thirtyeightyears : seasons . They came and went in the penitentiary too but for thirty-eight years the only right he had to them was the privilege of suffering because of them : from the heat and sun of summer whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , and the rain and icelike mud of winter whether he wanted to be out in it or not . But now they belonged to him again : October next week , not much to see in this flat Delta country which he had misdoubted the first time he laid eyes on it from the train window that day thirtyeightyears ago : just cotton stalks and cypress needles . But back home in the hills , all the land would be gold and crimsonwith hickory and gum and oak and maple , and the old fields warm with sage and splattered with scarlet sumac ; in thirty-eight years he had forgotten that . When suddenly , somewhere deep in memory , there was a tree , a single tree . His mother was dead ; he could n't remember her nor even how old he was when his father married again . So the woman was n't even kin to him and she never let him forget it : that she was raising him not from any tie or claim and not because he was weak and helpless and a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therep105was more than that behind it . He knew that at once  --  a gaunt harried slattern of a woman whom he remembered always either with a black eye or holding a dirty rag to her bleeding where her husband had struck her . Because he could always depend on her , not to do anything for him because she always failed there , but for constancy , to be always there and always aware of him , surrounding him always with that shield which actually protected , defended him from nothing but on the contrary seemed actually to invite more pain and grief . But simply to be there , lachrymose , harassed , yet constant . She was still in bed , it was midmorning ; she should have been hours since immolated into the ceaseless drudgery which composed her days . She was never ill , so it must have been the man had beat her this time even harder than he knew , lying there in the bed talking about food  --  the fatback , the coarse meal , the molasses which as far as he knew was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch or kill something else ; evidently this new blow had been somewhere about her stomach . " I cant eat hit , " she whimpered . " I need to relish something else . Maybe a squirrel . " He knew now ; that was the tree . He had to steal the shotgun : his father would have beat him within an inch of his life  --  to lug the clumsy weapon even taller than he was , into the woods , to the tree , the hickory , to ambush himself beneath it and crouch , waiting , in the drowsy splendorof the October afternoon , until the little creature appeared . Whereupon he began to tremble ( he had but the one shell ) and he remembered that too : the tremendous effort to raise the heavy gun long enough , panting against the stock , " Please God please God , " into the shock of the recoil and the reek of the black powder until he could drop the gun and run and pick up the still warm small furred body with hands that trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands trembling too as she fondled the carcass . " We 'll dress hit and cook hit now , " she said . " We 'll relish hit together right now . " The hickory itself was of course gone now , chopped into firewood or wagon spokesp106or single trees years ago ; perhaps the very place where it had stood was eradicated now into plowed land  --  or so they thought who had felled and destroyed it probably . But he knew better : unaxed in memory and unaxeable , inviolable and immune , golden and splendid with October . Why yes he thought it ai nt a place a man wants to go back to ; the place do nt even need to be there no more . What aches a man to go back to is what he remembers . Suddenly he craned his neck to see out the window . " Hit looks like  --  " and stopped . But he was free ; let all the earth know where he had been for thirty-eight years . "  --  Parchman , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What ? " he said . " Prisoners from the war . " " From the war ? " " Where you been the last five years , dad ? " the driver said . " Asleep ? " " I been away , " he said . " I mind one war they fit with the Spaniards when I was a boy , and there was another with the Germans after that one . Who did they fight this time ? " " Everybody . " The driver cursed . " Germans , Japanese , Congress too . Then they quit . If they had let us lick the Russians too , we might a been all right . But they just licked the Krauts and Japs and then decided to choke everybody else to death with money . " He thought Money . He said : " If you had twenty-five dollars and found thirty-eight more , how much would you have ? " " What ? " the driver said . " I would n't even stop to pick up just thirty-eight dollars . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty-three dollars and cant find nothing to do with it ? " Sixty-three he thought . So that 's how old I am . He thought quietly Not justice ; I never asked that ; jest fairness , that 's all . That was all ; not to have anything for him : just not to have anything against him . That was all he wanted , and sure enough , here it was.  | " You ai nt even going to meet the train ? " Chick says . Lawyer never even looked up , setting there at the desk with his attention ( his nose anyway ) buried in the papers in front of him like there was n't nobody else in the room . " Not just a new girl coming to town , " Chick says , " but a wounded female war veteran . Well , maybe not a new girl , " he says . " Maybe that 's the wrong word . In fact maybe new ' is the wrong word all the way round . Not a new girl in Jefferson , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a new girl in Jefferson or new anywhere else once , that would be just once because no matter how new you might have been anywhere once , you would n't be very new anywhereany more after you went to Spain with a Greenwich Village poet to fight Hitler . That is , not after the kind of Greenwich Village poet that would get you both blown up by a shell anyhow . That is , provided you were a girl . So just say , not only an old girl that used to be new , coming back to Jefferson , but the first girl old or new either that Jefferson ever had to come home wounded from a war . Men soldiers yes , of course yes . But this is the first female girl soldier we ever had , not to mention one actually wounded by the enemy . Naturally we do nt include rape for the main reason that we ai nt talking about rape . " Still his uncle did n't move . " I 'd think you 'd have the whole town down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple sympathetic interest , not to mention pity : a girl that went all the way to Spain to a war and the best she got out of it was to lose her husband and have both eardrums busted by a shell . Mrs Cole , " he says . Nor did Lawyer look up even then . " Kohl , " he says . " That 's what I said , " Chick says . " Mrs Cole . " This time Lawyer spelled it . " K-o-h-1 , " he says . But even before he spelled it , it had a different sound from the way  |p110Chick  said it . " He was a sculptor , not a poet . The shell did n't kill him . It was an aeroplane . " " Oh well , no wonder , if he was just a sculptor , " Chick says . " Naturally a sculptor would n't have the footwork to dodge machine-gun bullets like a poet . A sculptor would have to stay in one place too much of his time . Besides , maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He was in the aeroplane , " Lawyer says . " It was shot down . It crashed and burned . " " What ? " Chick says . " A Greenwich Village sculptor named K-o-h-1 actually in an aeroplane where it could get shot down by an enemy ? " He was looking more or less at the top of his uncle 's head . " Not Cole , " he says : " K-o-h-1 . I wonder why he did n't change it . Do nt they , usually ? " Now Lawyer closed the papers without no haste a-tall and laid them on the desk and pushed the swivel chair back and set back in it and clasped his hands behind his head . His hair had done already started turning gray when he come back from the war in France in 1919 . Now it was pretty near completely white , and him setting there relaxed and easy in the chair with that white mop of it and the little gold key he got when he was at Harvard on his watch chain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirt pocket like it was a pencil or a toothpick , looking at Chick for about a half a minute . " You did n't find that at Harvard , " he says . " I thought that maybe after two years in Cambridge , you might not even recognise it again when you came back to Mississippi . " " All right , " Chick says . " I 'm sorry . " But Lawyer just sat there easy in the chair , looking at him . " Damn it , " Chick says , " I said I 'm sorry . " " Only you 're not sorry yet , " Lawyer says . " You 're just ashamed . " " Ai nt it the same thing ? " Chick says . " No , " Lawyer says . " When you are just ashamed of something , you do nt hate it . You just hate getting caught . " " Well , you caught me , " Chick says . " I am ashamed.  |p111What  more do you want ? " Only Lawyer did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it yet , even after two years at Harvard , " Chick says . " Maybe I just lived too long a time among what us Mississippi folks call white people before I went there . You cant be ashamed of me for what I did n't know in time , can you ? " " I 'm not ashamed of you about anything , " Lawyer says . " All right , " Chick says . " Sorry , then . " " I 'm not sorry over you about anything either , " Lawyer says . " Then what the hell is all this about ? " Chick says . So a stranger that never happened to be living in Jefferson or Yoknapatawpha County ten or twelve years ago might have thought it was Chick that was the interested party . Not only interested enough to be jealous of his uncle , but interestedenough to already be jealous even when the subject or bone of contention not only had n't even got back home yet , he would n't even seen her since ten years ago . Which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even seen in ten years , but that he was n't but twelve or thirteen years old and she was already nineteen , a growed woman , when he seen her that last time  --  a insurmountable barrier of difference in age that would still been a barrier even with three or four more years added onto both of them , providing of course it was the gal that still had the biggest number of them . In fact you would think how a boy jest twelve or thirteen years old could n't be man-jealous yet ; would n't have enough fuel yet to fire jealousy and keep it burning very long or even a-tall over a gal nineteen years old or any other age between eight and eighty for that matter , except that how young does he have to be before he can dare to risk not having that fuel capable of taking fire and combusting ? Jest how young must he be to be safe for a little while longer yet , as the feller says , from having his heart strangled as good as any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or how old either , for the matter of that . Besides , this time when she come back , even though she would still be thep112same six or seven years older , this time they would be jest six or seven years older than twenty-two or twenty-three instead of six or seven years older than twelve or thirteen , and that ai nt no barrier a-tall . This time he would n't be no innocent infantile bystanding victim of that loop because this time he would be in there fighting for the right and privilege of being lassoed ; fighting not jest for the right and privilege of being strangled too , but of being strangled first . Which was exactly what he looked like he was trying to do : nudging and whetting at his uncle , reaching around for whatever stick or club or brickbat come to his hand like he was still jest twelve or thirteen years old or even less than that , grabbing up that one about Linda 's husband being a Jew for instance , because even at jest twelve , if he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that would n't even be a good solid straw as far as his present opponent or rival was concerned . Maybe that  --  swinging that straw at his uncle about how Lawyer had been the main one instrumental in getting Linda up there in New York where could n't no homefolks look after her and so sho enough she had went and married a Jew  --  was what give Chick away . Because he ai nt even seen her again yet ; he could n't a knowed all that other yet . I mean , knowed that even at jest twelve he already had all the jealousy he would ever need at twenty-two or eighty-two either . He would need to actively see her again to find out he had jest as much right as any other man in it to be strangled to death by this here new gal coming to town , and was n't no man wearing hair going to interfere in the way and save him . When he thought about her now , he would have to remember jest what that twelve- or thirteen-year-old boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same generalsize and shape of his own maw , belonging to and movingaround in the same alien human race the rest of the world except twelve-year-old boys belonged to . And , if it had n't been for his uncle finally stopping long enough hisselfto look at her and then you might say ketching Chickp113by the scruff of the neck and grinding his attention onto her by conscripting up half his out-of-school time toting notes back and forth to her for them after-school ice-cream-parlor dates her and Lawyer started to having , nowhere near as interesting . So when Chick remembered her now , he would still have to see what twelve or thirteen years old had seen : Hell fire , she 's durn nigh old as maw . He would have to actively look at her again to see what twenty-two or twenty-three would see : Hell fire , suppose she is a year or two older than me , jest so it 's me that 's the man of the two of us . So you and that stranger both would a thought how maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy of twelve or thirteen is capable of pure and undefiled , what you might call virgin , jealousy toward a man of thirty over a gal of nineteen  --  or of any other age between eight and eighty for that matter , jest as it takes a boy of twelve or thirteen to know the true anguish and passion and hope and despair of love ; you and that stranger both thinking that right up to that last final moment when Chick give his-self away free-for-nothing by grabbing up that one about Linda 's husband being not only a poet but a Jew too to hit at his uncle with . Then even that stranger would a realised Chick was n't throwing it at Linda a-tall : he was throwing it at his uncle ; that it was n't his uncle he was jealous of over Linda Snopes : he was jealous of Linda over his uncle . Then even that stranger would a had to say to Chick in his mind : Maybe you could n't persuade me onto your side at first , but we 're sholy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to me a little . BecauseI could remember , I was actively watching it , that time back there when Lawyer first got involved into Linda 's career as the feller says . I do nt mean when Lawyer thought her career got mixed up into hisn , nor even when he first thought he actively noticed her . Because she was already twelve or thirteen herself then and so Lawyer had already knowed her all her life or anyway since she was them one or two years old or whenever it is when hit 's folks beginp114to bring it out into the street in a baby buggy or toting it and you first notice how it not only is beginning to look like a human being , hit even begins to look a little like some specific family of folks you are acquainted with . And in a little town like Jefferson where not only ever body knows ever body else but ever body has got to see ever body else in town at least once in the twenty-four hours whether he wants to or not , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to see her at least once a week . Not to mention having to know even before he could recognise her to remember , that she was Eula Varner 's daughter that all Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County both that had ever seen Eula Varner first , could n't help but look at Eula Varner'schild with a kind of amazement , like at some minutesizedmonster , since anybody , any man anyhow , that ever looked at Eula once could n't help but believe that all that much woman in jest one simple normal-sized chunk could n't a possibly been fertilised by anything as frail and puny in comparison as jest one single man ; that it would a taken that whole generation of young concentrated men to seeded them , as the feller says , splendid  --  no : he would a said magnificent  --  loins . And I do nt mean when Lawyer voluntarily went oaten his way and adopted Linda 's career into a few spare extra years of hisn like he thought he was doing . What I mean is , when Eula Varner taken that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that first one look of hisn at her , whicheverway you want to put it  --  and adopted the rest of his life into that of whatever first child she happened to have , providingof course it 's a gal . Like when you finally see the woman that had ought to been yourn all the time , only it 's already too late . The woman that ought to been sixteen maybe at this moment and you not more than nineteen ( which at that moment when he first seen Eula Lawyer activelywas ; it was Eula that was out of focus , being as she was already a year older than Lawyer to start with ) and you look at her that first one time and in the next moment saysp115to her : " You 're beautiful . I love you . Let 's do nt never part again , " and she says , " Yes , of course "  --  no more concerned than that : " Of course I am . Of course you do . Of course we wont . " Only it 's already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except it was n't too late . It ai nt never too late and wont never be , providing , no matter how old you are , you still are that-ere nineteen-year-old boy that said that to that sixteen-year-old gal at that one particular momentouten all the moments you might ever call yourn . Becausehow can it ever be too late to that nineteen-year-old boy , because how can that sixteen-year-old gal you had to say that to ever be violated , it do nt matter how many husbandsshe might a had in the meantime , providing she activelywas the one that had to say " Of course " right back at you ? And even when she is toting the active proof of that violation around in her belly or even right out in plain sight on her arm or dragging at the tail of her skirt , immolating hit and her both back into virginity would n't be no trick a-tall to that nineteen-year-old boy , since naturally that sixteen-year-old gal could n't possibly be fertilised by no other seed except hisn , I do nt care who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except that Lawyer did n't know all that yet neither . Mainly because he was too busy . I mean , that day when Eula first walked through the Jefferson Square where not jest Lawyer but all Jefferson too would have to see her . That time back there when Flem had finally grazed up Uncle Billy Varner and Frenchman 's Bend and so he would have to move on somewhere , and Jefferson was as good a place as any since , as the feller says , any spoke leads sooner or later to the rim . Or in fact maybe Jefferson was for the moment unavoidable , being as Flem had done beat me outen my half of that cafe me and Grover Winbush owned , and since there was n't no easy quick practical way to get Grover out to Frenchman 's Bend , Flem would simply have to make a stopover at least in Jefferson while he evicted Grover outen the rest of it.  |p116Anyhow  , Lawyer seen her at last . And there he was , enteringnot jest bare-handed but practically nekkid too , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose it  --  Lawyer , a town-raised bachelor that was going to need a Master of Arts from Harvard and a Doctor of Philosophy from Heidelberg jest to stiffen him up to where he could cope with the natural normal Yoknapatawpha County folks that never wanted nothing except jest to break a few aggravatinglaws that was in their way or get a little free money outen the county treasury ; and Eula Varner that never needed to be educated nowhere because jest what the Lord had already give her by letting her stand up and breathe and maybe walk around a little now and then was trouble and danger enough for ever male man in range . For Lawyer to win that match would be like them spiders , that the end of the honeymoon is when she finally finishes eating up his last drumstick . Which likely enough Lawyer knowed too , being nineteen years old and already one year at Harvard . Though even without Harvard , a boy nineteen years old ought to know that much about women jest by instinct , like a child or a animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand or his foot in it . Even when a nineteen-year-old boy says " You 're beautiful and I love you , " even he ought to know whether it 's a sixteen-year-old gal or a tiger that says " Certainly " back at him . Anyhow , there Lawyer was , rushing headlong into that engagement that not only the best he could expect and hope for but the best he could want would be to lose it , since losingit would n't do nothing but jest knock off some of his hide here and there . Rushing in with nothing in his hand to fight with but that capacity to stay nineteen years old the rest of his life , to take on that McCarron boy that had not only cuckolded him before he ever seen Eula , but that was going to keep on cuckolding him in one or another different name and shape even after he would finally give up . Because maybeFlem never had no reason to pick out Jefferson to come to ; maybe one spoke was jest the same as another to himp117since all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know he had a reason for Jefferson . Or maybe married men do nt even need reasons , being as they already got wives . Or maybeit 's women that do nt need reasons , for the simple reason that they never heard of a reason and would n't recognise it face to face , since they do nt function from reasons but from necessities that could n't nobody help nohow and that do nt nobody but a fool man want to help in the second place , because he do nt know no better ; it ai nt women , it 's men that takes ignorance seriously , getting into a skeer over something for no more reason than that they do nt happen to know what it is . So it was n't Grover Winbush and what you might call that dangling other half of mine and his cafe that brought Miz Flem Snopes to Jefferson so she could walk across the Square whatever that afternoon was when Lawyer had to look at her . It was n't even Eula herself . It was that McCarronboy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rest of it . Because that was about all folks within five miles of Varner 's store talked about that spring . The full unchallenged cynosure you might say of the whole Frenchman'sBend section , from sometime in March to the concludingdee-neweyment or meelee which taken place jest beyond the creek bridge below Varner 's house one night in the following July  --  that McCarron boy coming in to Frenchman'sBend that day without warning out of nowhere like a cattymount into a sheep pen among them Bookwrights and Binfords and Quicks and Tulls that for about a year now had been hitching their buggies and saddle mules to Will Varner 's fence . Like a wild buck from the woods jumping the patch fence and already trompling them tame domestic local carrots and squashes and eggplants that until that moment was thinking or leastways hoping that Eula 's maiden citadel was actively being threatened and endangered , before they could even blench , let alone cover their heads . Likely  --  in fact , they had done a little local bragging to that effect  --  they called theirselves pretty unbitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere jest exactly like a wild buck from the woods , like he had done located Eula from miles and even days away outen the hard unerring air itself and come as straight as a die to where she was waiting , not for him especially but maybe for jest any wild strong buck that was wild and strong enough to deserve and match her . Yes sir . As the feller says , the big buck : the wild buck right off the mountain itself , with his tail already up and his eyes already flashing . Because them Bookwrights and Quicks and Tulls was pretty fair bucks theirselves , on that-ere home Frenchman 's Bend range and reservation you might say , providing them outside boundary limits posted signs was n't violated by these here footloose rambling uninvited strangers . In fact , they was pretty good at kicking and gouging and no holts barred and no bad feelings afterward , in all innocentfriendliness and companionship not jest among one another but with that same friendly willingness to give and take when it was necessary to confederate up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five or six miles away that ought to stayed at home , had no business there , neither needed nor wanted , that had happened to see Eula somewhere once or maybe jest heard about her from somebody else that had watched her walk ten or fifteen feet . So he had to come crowding his buggy or mule up to Varner 's picket fence some Sunday night , then coming innocently back down the road toward the gum and cypress thicket where the road crossed the creek bridge , his head still filled with female Varner dreams until the unified corporation stepped outen the thicket and bushwhacked them outen it and throwed creek water on him and put him back in the buggy or on the mule and wrapped the lines around the whipstock or the horn and headed him on toward wherever it was he lived and if he 'd a had any sense he would n't a left it in the first place or at least in this direction . But this here new one was a different animal . Because they  --  including them occasional volunteers  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal  --  Frenchman 's Bend pattern , while McCarron was n't in nobody 's pattern ; he was unbitted not because he was afraid of a bit but simply because so fur he did n't prefer to be . So there not only was n't here a one of them would stand up to him alone , the whole unified confederated passel of them , that never hesitatedone second to hide in that thicket against any other interloper that come sniffing at Varner 's fence , never nerved theirselves up to him until it was already too late . Oh sho , they had chances . They had plenty of chances . In fact , he give them so many chances that by the end of May they would n't even walk a Frenchman 's Bend road after dark , even in sight of one of their own houses , without they was at least three of them . Because this here was a different kind of a buck , coming without warning right off the big mountainitself and doing what Lawyer would call arrogating to his-self what had been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on a year or two now . Not ravishing Eula away : not riding up on his horse and snatching her up behind him and galloping off , but jest simplymoving in and dispossessing them ; not even evicting them but like he was keeping them on hand for a chorus you might say , or maybe jest for spice , like you keep five or six cellars of salt setting handy while you are eating the watermelon , until it was already too late , until likely as not , as fur as they or Frenchman 's Bend either knowed , Eula was already pregnant with Linda . Except I do nt think that was exactly it . I do nt think I prefer it to happened that way . I think I prefer it to happenedall at once . Or that ai nt quite right neither . I think what I prefer is , that them five timorous local stallions activelybrought about the very exact thing they finally nerved their desperation up to try to prevent . There they all was , poised on the brink you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them : Eula and McCarron , and them five Tulls and Bookwrights and Turpins and Binfords and Quicks . Because what them Tulls and Quicks would ap120called the worst had n't happened yet . I do nt mean the worst in respects to Eula 's chastity nor to the violated honor of Uncle Billy Varner 's home , but in respects to them two years ' investment of buggies and mules tied to the Varner fence when them and the five folks keeping them hitched there half the night both had ought to been home getting a little rest before going back to the field to plow at sunup , instead of having to live in a constantly shifting confederationof whatever four of them happened to believe that the fifth one was out in front in that-ere steeplechase , not to mention the need for all five of them having to gang up at a moment 's notice maybe at almost any time on some stray interloper that turned up without warning with his head full of picket fence ideas too . So I prefer to believe it had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCarron was waiting on . I mean , what McCarron was waiting on . Eula never done no waiting . Likely she never even knowed what the word meant , like the ground , dirt , the earth , whatever it is in it that makes seed sprout at the right time , do nt know nor need to know what waiting means . Since to know what waiting means , you got to be skeered or weak or self-doubtful enough to know what impatience or hurry means , and Eula never needed them no more than that dirt does . All she needed was jest to be , like the ground of the field , until the right time come , the right wind , the right sun , the right rain ; until in fact that-ere single unique big buck jumped that tame garden fence outen the big woods or the high mountain or the tall sky , and finally got through jest standing there among the sheep with his head up , looking proud . So it was McCarron that put off that long what you might call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jest stand there for a while looking proud among the sheep . Maybe that was it : maybe he was jest simply having too much fun at first , playing with them Bookwright and Quick sheep , tantalising them up maybeto see jest how much they would have to stand to forget for a moment they was sheep , or to remember that maybep121they was sheep but at least there was five of them , until at last they would risk him jest like he actively was n't nothing but jest one more of them natural occupational local hazards Eula had done already got them accustomed to handling . So maybe you can figger what they was waiting on . They was church folks . I mean , they went to church a heap of Sundays , and Wednesday night prayer meeting too , unless something else come up . Because church was as good a place as any to finish up one week and start another , especially as there was n't no particular other place to go on Sunday morning ; not to mention a crap game down back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or listening ; and who knowed but how on almost any Wednesday night you might ketch some young gal and persuade her off into the bushes before her paw or maw noticed she was missing . Or maybe they never needed to ever heard it , since likely it was n't even Samson and Delilah that was the first ones to invent that hair-cutting eupheemism neither . So the whole idea might be what you would call a kind of last desperate instinctive hereditary expedient waiting handy for ever young feller ( or old one either ) faced with some form of man-trouble over his gal . So at least you knowed what they was waiting for . Naturally they would preferred to preserve that-ere maiden Varner citadel until one of them could manage to shake loose from the other four by luck or expedient long enough to ravage it . But now that this uninvited ringer had come in and wrecked ever thing anyhow , at least they could use that violation and rapine not only for revenge but to evict him for good from meddling around Frenchman 's Bend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment when he was wore out and exhausted with pleasure and success ; they was n't that bad . But since they could n't prevent the victory , at least ketch him at a moment when he was n't watching , when his mind was still fondly distracted and divided between what you might call bemusements with the recent past , which would a been last night , and aspira/tions toward the immediate future , which would be in a few minutes now as soon as the buggy reached a convenient place to hitch the horse . Which is what they  --  the ambushment  --  done . They was wrong of course ; had n't nothing happened yet . I mean , I prefer that even that citadel was still maiden right up to this moment . No : what I mean is , I wont have nothing else for the simple dramatic verities except that ever thing happened right there that night and all at once ; that even that McCarron boy , that compared to them other five was a wild stag surrounded by a gang of goats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it taken all six of them even to ravage that citadel , let alone seed them loins with a child : that July night and the buggy coming down the hill until they heard the horse 's feet come off the creek bridge and the five of them , finally nerved up to even this last desperate gambit , piling outen that familiar bushwhacking thicket that up to this time had handled them local trespassing rams so simple and easy you would n't hardly need to dust off your hands afterward . Naturally they never brought no bystanders with them and after the first two or three minutes there was n't no witness a-tall left , since he was already laying out cold in the ditch . So my conjecture is jest as good as yourn , maybe better since I 'm a interested party , being as I got what the feller calls a theorem to prove . In fact , it may not taken even three minutes , one of them jumping to ketch the horse 's head and the other four rushing to snatch McCarron outen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buggy by that time and not already blazing bushes up the creek , havingchosen quick between discretion and valor , it do nt mattera hoot who was looking , as had happened before with at least one of the invaders that had been quick enough . Which , by the trompled evidence folks went to look at the next day , McCarron was n't , though not for the already precedented reason . Nor did the evidence explain jest what . ' the wagon spoke was doing there neither that broke McCarron'sarm : only that McCarron had the wagon spokep123now in his remaining hand in the road while Eula was standing up in the buggy with that lead-loaded buggy whip reversedin both hands like a hoe or a axe , swinging the leaded butt of it at whatever head come up next . Not over three minutes , at the outside . It would n't needed more than that . It would n't wanted more : it was all that simple and natural  --  a pure and simple natural circumstance as simple and natural and ungreedy as a tide-wave or a cloudburst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a considerableof trompling and panting and cussing and nothing much to see except a kind of moil of tangled shadows around the horse ( It never moved . But then it spent a good part of its life ever summer right in the middle of Will 's sawmill and it stood right there in the yard all the time Will was evicting Ab Snopes from a house he had n't paid no rent on in two years , which was the nearest thing to a cyclone Frenchman 's Bend ever seen ; it was said that Will could drive up to a depot and get outen the buggy and not even hitch it while a train passed , and only next summer it was going to be tied to the same lot gate that them wild Texas ponies Flem Snopes brought back from Texas demolishedright up to the hinges when they run over Frenchman'sBend. ) and buggy and the occasional gleam of that hickory wagon spoke interspersed among the mush-melon thumps of that loaded buggy whip handle on them Frenchman'sBend skulls . And then jest the empty horse and buggy standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barn or whatever it was the tide-wave or cloudburst has done took its one rightful ungreedy swipe at and went away , and that-ere one remainingevidence  --  it was Theron Quick ; for a week after it you could still see the print of that loaded buggy whip across the back of his skull ; not the first time naming him Quick turned out to be what the feller calls jest a humorous allusion  --  laying cold in the weeds beside the road . And that 's when I believe it happened . I do nt even insist or argue that it happened that way . I jest simply decline top124have it any other way except that one because there ai nt no acceptable degrees between what has got to be right and what jest can possibly be . So it never even stopped . I mean , the motion , movement . It was one continuous natural rush from the moment five of them busted outen that thicket and grabbed at the horse , on through the cussing and trompling and hard breathing and the final crashing through the bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other four thought Theron was dead ; then jest the peaceful quiet and the dark road and the horse standing quiet in the buggy in the middle of it and Theron Quick sleeping peacefully in the weeds . And that 's when I believe it happened : not no cessation a-tall , not even no active pausing ; not jest that maiden bastion capitulate and overrun but them loins themselves seeded , that child , that girl , Linda herself created into life right there in the road with likely Eula having to help hold him up offen the broke arm and the horse standing over them among the stars like one of them mounted bib game trophy heads stickingouten the parlor or the liberry or ( I believe they call them now ) den wall . In fact maybe that 's what it was . So in almost no time there was Will Varner with a pregnantunmarried daughter . I mean , there Frenchman 's Bend was because even in them days when you said " Frenchman 's Bend " you smiled at Uncle Billy Varner , or vice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cycloneor a tide-wave , Uncle Billy was one too even if he was n't no more than forty yet : that had shaved notes and foreclosed liens and padded furnish bills and evicted tenants until the way Will Varner went Frenchman 's Bend had done already left and the folks that composed it had damn sho better hang on and go too , unless they jest wanted to settle down in vacant space twenty-two miles southeast of Jefferson . Naturally the McCarron boy was the man to handle the Varner family honor right there on the spot . After the first shock , folks all thought that 's what he had aimed to do . Hep125was the only child of a well-to-do widowed maw up in Tennessee somewhere until he happened to be wherever it was his fate arranged for him to have his look at Eula Varner like theirn would do for Lawyer Stevens and Manfredde Spain about a year later . And , being the only child of a well-to-do maw and only educated in one of them fancy gentleman 's schools , you would naturally expect him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm splinted up , let alone waiting for Will Varner to reach for his shotgun . Except you would be wrong . Maybe you not only do nt run outen the middle of a natural catastrophe  --  you might be flung outen it by centrifugal force or , if you had any sense , you might tried to dodge it . But you do nt change your mind and plans in the middle of it . Or he might in his case even wanted to stay in the middle of that particular one untilit taken the rest of his arms and legs too , as likely any number of them other Quicks and Tulls and Bookwrights would elected to do . Not to mention staying in that select school that even in that short time some of them high academicstandards of honor and chivalry rubbed off on him by jest exposure . Anyhow it was n't him that left that-ere now-flyspecked Varner family honor high and dry . It was Eula herself that done it . So now all you can do is try to figger . So maybe it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like maybe that centrifugal force that had n't touched him but that one light time and he had already begun to crumple . That simple natural phenomenon that maybe did n't expect to meet another phenomenon , even a natural one , but at least expected or maybe jest hoped for something at least tough enough to crash back without losinga arm or a leg the first time they struck . Because next time it might be a head , which would mean the life along with it , and then all that force and power and unskeeredness and unskeerableness to give and to take and suffer the consequencesit taken to be a female natural phenomenon in its phenomenal moment , would be wasted , throwed away.  |p126Because  I ai nt talking about love . Natural phenomenons ai nt got no more concept of love than they have of the alarm and uncertainty and impotence you got to be capable of to know what waiting means . When she said to herself , and likely she did : The next one of them creek-bridge episodes might destroy him completely , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anyhow , the next morning he was gone from Frenchman'sBend . I presume it was Eula that put what was left of the buggy whip back into the socket and druv the buggy back up the hill . Leastways they waked Will , and Will in his nightshirt ( no shotgun : it would be anywhere up to twentyeightdays , give or take a few , before he would find out he needed the shotgun ; it was jest his little grip of veterinary tools yet ) patched up the arm to where he could drive on home or somewhere that more than a local cow-and-mule doctor could get a-holt of him . But he was back in Jefferson at least once about a month later , about the time when Eula likely found out if she did n't change her condition pretty quick now , it was going to change itself for her . And he even paid the mail rider extra to carry a special wrote-out private message to Eula . But nothing come of that neither , and at last he was gone . And sho enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening  --  and if you had expected a roar of some kind to come up outen the Varner residence and environment , you would been wrong there too : it was jest a quick announcement that even then barely beat the wedding itself  --  Herman Bookwright and Theron Quick left Frenchman 's Bend suddenly overnight too though it 's my belief they was both not even bragging but jest wishing they had , and Eula and Flem was married ; and after the one more week it taken Will to do what he thought was beating Flem down to acceptingthat abandoned Old Frenchman place as full receipt for Eula 's dowry , Eula and Flem left for Texas , which was fur enough away so that when they come back , that-ere new Snopes baby would look at least reasonably legal or maybep127what I mean is orthodox . Not to mention as Texas would be where it had spent the presumable most of its prenatal existence , would n't nobody be surprised if it was cutting its teeth at three months old . And when they was back in Frenchman 's Bend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had got to be a pretty good-size gal in jest them three possible months , all he had to do was remind his-self that them three outside months had been laid in Texas likewise . Jest exactly fourteen months since that McCarron boy started to crumple at the seams at that first encounter . But it was n't waiting . Not a natural phenomenon like Eula . She was jest being , breathing , setting with that baby in a rocking chair on Varner 's front gallery while Hem changed enough money into them sixty silver dollars and buried them in that Old Frenchman place rose garden jest exactly where me and Henry Armstid and Odum Bookwright could n't help but find them . And still jest being and breathing , setting with the baby in the wagon that day they moved in to Jefferson so Flem could get a active holt on Grover Winbush to evict him outen the other half of that cafe me and Grover owned . And still jest being and breathing but not setting now because likely even the tide-wave do nt need to be informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's due at next , her and Flem and the baby living in that canvas tent behind the cafe betweenwhen she would walk across the Square until finally Manfred de Spain , the McCarron that would n't start or break up when they collided together , would look up and see her . Who had n't had none of them select advantages of being the only child of a well-to-do widowed maw living in Florida hotels while he was temporarily away at them select eastern schools , but instead had had to make out the best he could with jest being the son of a Confederate cavalry officer , that graduated his-self from West Point into what his paw would a called the Yankee army and went to Cuba as a lieutenant and come back with a long jagged scar down one cheek that the folks trying to beat him for mayorp128rumored around was n't made by no Spanish bayonet a-tall but instead by a Missouri sergeant with a axe in a crap game : which , whether it was so or not , never stood up long between him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to be president of Colonel Sartoris 's bank when that come up , not to mention between him and Eula Varner Snopes when that come up . I ai nt even mentioning Lawyer . It was n't even his bad luck he was on that rim too because tide-waves ai nt concerned with luck . It was his fate . He jest got run over by coincidence , like a ant using the same spoke a elephant happened to find necessary or convenient . It was n't that he was born too soon or too late or even in the wrong place . He was born at exactly the right time , only in the wrong envelope . It was his fate and doom not to been born into one of them McCarron separate covers too instead of into that fragile and what you might call gossamer-sinewed envelopeof boundless and hopeless aspiration Old Moster give him . So there he was , rushing headlong into that engagement that the best he could possibly hope would be to lose it quick , since any semblance or intimation of the most minorestvictory would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snopes grazed gently on up them new Jefferson pastures , him and his wife and infant daughter still living in the tent behind the cafe and Flem his-self frying the hamburgersnow after Grover Winbush found out suddenly one day that he never owned one half of a cafe neither ; then the Rouncewells that thought they still owned what Miz Rouncewellcalled the Commercial Hotel against all the rest of Yoknapatawpha County calling it the Rounceweil boarding house , found they was wrong too and the Flem Snopeses lived there now , during the month or so it taken him to eliminate the Rouncewells outen it , with the next Snopes from Frenchman 's Bend imported into the tent behind the cafe and frying the hamburgers because Flem his-self was now superintendent of the power plant ; Manfred de Spainp129had not only seen Eula , he was already mayor of Jefferson when he done it . And still Lawyer was trying , even while at least once ever day he would have to see his mortal victorious rival and conqueror going in and out of the mayor 's office or riding back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadster that most of north Missippi , let alone jest Yoknapatawpha County , had n't seen nothing like before ; right on up and into that alley behind the Ladies ' Cotillion Club Christmas ball where he tried to fight Manfred with his bare fists until his sister 's husband drug him up outen the gutter and held him long enough for Manfred to get outen sight and then taken him home to the bathroom to wash him off and says to him : " What the hell do you mean ? Do nt you know you do nt know how to fight ? " And Lawyer leaning over the washbowl trying to stanch his nose with handfuls of tissue paper , saying , " Of course I know it . But can you suh-jest a better way than this for me to learn ? " And still trying , on up to that last desperate cast going all the way back to that powerhouse brass business . I mean , that pile of old wore-out faucets and valves and pieces of brass pipe and old bearings and such that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the second year of Flem 's reign as superintendent , though there was n't no direct evidence against nobody even after the brass safety valves vanished from both the boilers and was found to been replaced with screwed-in steel plugs ; it was jest that finally the city auditorshad to go to the superintendent and advise him as delicateas possible that that brass was missing and Flem quit chewing long enough to say " How much ? " and paid them and then the next year they done the books again and found they had miscounted last year and went to him again and suh-jested they had made a mistake before and Flem quit chewing again long enough to say " How much ? " and paid them that too . Going ( I mean Lawyer ) all the way back to them old by-gones even though Flem was not only longp130since resigned from being superintendent , he had even bought two new safety valves outen his own pocket as a free civic gift to the community ; bringing all that up again , with evidence , in a suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dukinfield recused his-self and appointed Judge Stevens , Lawyer 's paw , to hear the case . Only we did n't know what happened then because Judge Stevens cleared the court and heard the argument in chambersas they calls it , jest Lawyer and Manfred and the judge his-self . And that was all ; it never taken long ; almost right away Manfred come out and went back to his mayor 's office , and the tale , legend , report , whatever you want to call it , of Lawyer standing there with his head bent a little in front of his paw , saying , " What must I do now , Papa ? Papa , what can I do now ? " But he was chipper enough the next morning when I seen him off on the train , that had done already graduated from Harvard and the University law school over at Oxford and was now on his way to a town in Germany to go to school some more . Yes sir , brisk and chipper as you could want . " Here you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want with you before I leave : to pass the torch on into your personal hand . You 'll have to hold the fort alone now . You 'll have to tote the load by yourself . " " What fort ? " I says . " What load ? " " Jefferson , " he says . " Snopeses . Think you can handle them alone for two years ? " That 's what he thought then : that he was all right now ; he had done been disenchanted for good at last of Helen , and so now all he had to worry about was what them Menelaus-Snopeses might be up to in the Yoknapatawpha-Argive community while he had his back turned . Which was all right ; it would ease his mind . He would have plenty of time after he come back to find out that ai nt nobody yet ever lost Helen , since for the rest of not jest her life but hisn too she do nt never get shut of him . Likely it 's because she do nt want to . Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That wasp131in the early spring of 1914 , and that summer the war come , and maybe that  --  a war  --  was what he was looking for . Not hoping for , let alone expecting to have one happen jest on his account , since like most other folks in this countryhe did n't believe no war was coming . But looking for something , anything , and certainly a war would do as well as another , since no matter what his brains might a been telling him once he had that much water between him and Eula Snopes , even his instincts likely told him that jest two years was n't nowhere near enough for him or Helen either to have any confidence in that disenchantment . So even if he could n't anticipate no war to save him , back in his mind somewhere he was still confident that Providence would furnish something , since like he said , God was anyhow a gentleman and would n't bollix up the same feller twice with the same trick , at least in the same original package . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered  --  at least I did  --  why he never went into it on the German side . Not jest because he was already in Germany and the Germanshandy right there surrounding him , but because he had already told me how , although it was the culture of England that had sent folks this fur across the water to establishAmerica , right now it was the German culture that had the closest tie with the modern virile derivations of the northern branch of the old Aryan stock . Because he said that tie was mystical , not what you seen but what you heard , and that the present-day Aryan , in America at least , never had no confidence a-tall in what he seen , but on the contrary would believe anything he jest heard and could n't prove ; and that the modern German culture since the revolutionsof 1848 never had no concern with , and if anything a little contempt for , anything that happened to man on the outside , or through the eyes and touch , like sculpture and painting and civil laws for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his ears , like music and philosophy and what was wrong inside of his mind . Which he said was the reason why German was such ap132ugly language , not musical like Italian and Spanish nor what he called the epicene exactitude of French , but was harsh and ugly , not to mention full of spit ( like as the feller says , you speak Italian to men , French to women , and German to horses ) , so that there would n't be nothing to interfere and distract your mind from what your nerves and glands was hearings the mystical ideas , the glorious music  --  Lawyersaid , the best of music , from the mathematical inevitabilityof Mozart through the godlike passion of Beethoven and Bach to the combination bawdy-house street-carnival uproar that Wagner made  --  that come straight to the modernvirile northern Aryan 's heart without bothering his mind a-tall . Except that he did n't join the German army . I do nt know what lies he managed to tell the Germans to get out of Germany where he could join the enemy fighting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and French to explain why a student out of a German university was a safe risk to have around where he might overhear somebody telling what surprise they was fixing up next . But he done it . And it was n't the English army he joined neither . It was the French one : them folks that , according to him , spent all their time talking about epicene exactitudes to ladies . And I did n't know why even four years later when I finally asked him : " After all you said about that-ere kinship of German culture , and the German army right there in the middle of you , or leastways you in the middle of it , you still had to lie or trick your way out to join the French one . " Because all he said was , " I was wrong . " And not even another year after that when I said to him , " Even despite that splendid glorious music and them splendid mystical ideas ? " he jest says : " They are still glorious , still splendid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ideas both come out of obscurity , darkness . Not out of shadow : out of obscurity , obfuscation , darkness . Man must have light . He must live in the fierce full constant glare of light , where all shadowp133will be defined and sharp and unique and personal : the shadow of his own singular rectitude or baseness . All humanevils have to come out of obscurity and darkness , where there is nothing to dog man constantly with the shape of his own deformity . " In fact not until two or three years more and he was back home now , settled now ; and Eula , still without having to do no more than jest breathe as far as he was concerned , had already adopted the rest of his life as long as it would be needed , into the future of that eleven- or twelve-yearoldgirl , and I said to him : " Helen walked in light . " And he says , " Helen was light . That 's why we can still see her , not changed , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I says , " What about all them others you talk about ? Semiramises and Judiths and Liliths and Francescas and Isoldes ? " And he says , " But not like Helen . Not that bright , that luminous , that enduring . It 's because the others all talked . They are fadingsteadily into the obscurity of their own vocality within which their passions and tragedies took place . But not Helen . Do you know there is not one recorded word of hers anywhere in existence , other than that one presumable Yes she must have said that time to Paris ? " So there they was . That gal of thirteen and fourteen and fifteen that was n't trying to do nothing but jest get shut of having to go to school by getting there on time and knowing the lesson to make the rise next year , that likely would n't barely ever looked at him long enough to know him again except that she found out on a sudden that for some reason he was trying to adopt some of her daily life into hisn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into hern , whichever way you want to put it . And that bachelor lawyertwice her age , that was already more or less in the public eye from being county attorney , not to mention in a little town like Jefferson where ever time you had your hair cutp134your constituency knowed about it by suppertime . So that the best they knowed to do was to spend fifteen minutes after school one or two afternoons a week at a table in the window of Uncle Willy Christian 's drugstore while she et a ice-cream sody or a banana split and the ice melted into the unteched Coca-Cola in front of him . Not jest the best but the only thing , not jest for the sake of her good name but also for them votes that two years from now might not consider buying ice cream for fourteen-year-old gals a fittingqualification for a county attorney . About twice a week meeting her by that kind of purely coincidental accident that looked jest exactly as accidental as you would expect : Lawyer ambushed behind his upstairs office window across the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass , which would be the kindergardenand the first grade , then by that same accidental coincidencehappening to be on the corner at the exact time to cut her outen the seventh or eighth or ninth grade , her looking a little startled and surprised the first time or two ; not alarmed : jest startled a little , wondering jest a little at first maybe what he wanted . But not for long ; that passed too and pretty soon Lawyer was even drinking maybe a inch of the Coca-Cola before it got too lukewarm to swallow . Until one day I says to him : " I envy you , " and he looked at me and I says , " Your luck , " and he says , " My which luck ? " and I says , " You are completely immersed twenty-four hours a day in being busy . Most folks ai nt . Almost nobody ai nt . But you are . Doing the one thing you not only got to do , but the one thing in the world you want most to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got as many or maybe even more interesting technical complications in it than if you had inventedit yourself instead of jest being discovered by it .

Do nt you call that keeping busy ? " Because he was unenchanted now , you see , done freed at last of that fallen seraphim . It was Eula herself had give him a salve , a ointment , for that bitter thumb the poets say ever man once in his life has got to gnaw at : that gal thirteenthen fourteen then fifteen setting opposite him in Christian 's drugstore maybe two afternoons a week in the intervals of them coincidental two or three weeks ever year while Miz Flem Snopes and her daughter would be on a holiday somewhere at the same coincidental time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor de Spain now but Banker de Spain since Colonel Sartoris finally vacated the presidency of the bank him and De Spain 's paw and Will Varner had established , by letting his grandson run the automobile off into a ditch on the way to town one morning , and now Manfred de Spain was president of the bank , movingouten the mayor 's office into the president 's office at about the same more or less coincidental moment that Flem Snopes moved outen being the ex-superintendent of the power plant , into being vice-president of the bank , vacating simultaneously outen that little cloth cap he come to Jeffersonin ( jest vacated , not abandoned it , the legend being he sold it to a Negro boy for ten cents . Which would n't be a bad price , since who knows if maybe some of that-ere financial acumen might not a sweated off onto it. ) into a black felt planter 's hat suitable to his new position and avocation . Oh yes , Lawyer was unenchanted now , even setting alone now and then in Christian 's window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back home , maybe to be ready and in practice when them two simultaneous coincidences was over and school would open again on a whole fresh year of two afternoons a week  --  providing of course that sixteen- and seventeen-year-old gal never run into a Hoake McCarron or a Manfred de Spain of her own between two of them and Lawyer could say to you like thep136man in the book : What you see ai nt tears . You jest think that 's what you 're looking at . Sixteen and seventeen and going on eighteen now and Lawyer still lending her books to read and keeping her stallfedtwice a week on ice-cream sundaes and banana splits , so anyhow Jefferson figgered it knowed what Lawyer was up to whether he admitted it out or not . And naturally Eula had already knowed for five or six years what she was after . Like there 's a dog , maybe not no extra dog but leastways a good sound what you might call a dog 's dog , that do nt seem to belong to nobody else , that seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five or six years you ai nt completely convinced there wont never be no other dog available , and that even them five or six years back and even with another five or six years added onto now , you never needed and you ai nt going to need that dog personally , there ai nt any use in simply throwing away and wasting its benefits and accomplishments , even if they ai nt nothing but fidelity and devotion , by letting somebody else get a-holt of it . Or say you got a gal child coming along , that the older and bigger she gets , the more of a nuisance she 's bound to be on your time and private occupations : in which case not only wont that fidelity and devotion maybe come into handy use , but even the dog itself might that could still be capable of them long after even hit had give up all expectation of even one bone . Which is what Jefferson figgered . But not me . Maybe even though she got rid of Hoake McCarron , even after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even female physical phenomenons is female first whether they want to be or not . So I believe that women ai nt so different from men : that if it ai nt no trouble nor shock neither for a man to father onto his-self the first child of the woman he loved and lost and still cant rid outen his mind , no matter how many other men holp to get it , it ai nt no trouble neither for that woman to father a dozen different men 's chillenp137onto that man that lost her and still never expected nothing of her except to accept his devotion . And since she was a female too , likely by the time Linda was thirteen or fourteen or even maybe as soon as she got over that first startle , which would a been at the second or third ice-cream sody , she taken for granted she knowed what he was aiming at too . And she would a been wrong . That was n't Lawyer . Jest to train her up and marry her was n't it . She would n't a been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal following lifetime up to the divorceof steady uxorious hymeneal conflict that any female he could a picked outen that school crowd or from Christian'ssody counter would been fully competent for . Jest that would n't a been worth his effort . He had to be the sole one masculine feller within her entire possible circumambience , not jest to recognise she had a soul still capable of being saved from what he called Snopesism : a force and power that stout and evil as to jeopardise it jest from her believing for twelve or thirteen years she was blood kin when she actively was n't no kin a-tall , but that could n't nobody else in range and reach but him save it  --  that-ere bubble-glass thing somewhere inside her like one of them shimmercoloredballs balanced on the seal 's nose , fragile yet immune too jest that one constant fragile inch above the smutch and dirt of Snopes as long as the seal do nt trip or stumble or let her attention wander . So all he aimed to do was jest to get her outen Jefferson or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with the nine months of the school year , until somebody would find her and marry her and she would be gone for good  --  a optimist pure and simple and undefiled if there ever was one since ever body knowed that the reason Flem Snopes was vice-president of De Spain 's bank was the same reason he was ex-superintendent of the power plant : in the one case folks wanting to smile at Eula Varner had to at least be able to pronounce Flem Snopes , and in the other De Spain had to take Flem along with him to get the use ofp138Will Varner 's voting stock to get his-self president . And the only reason why Will Varner never used this chance to get back at Flem about that Old Frenchman homesite that Will thought was n't worth nothing until Flem sold it to me and Odum Bookwright and Henry Armstid for my half of mine and Grover Winbush 's cafe and Odum Bookwright 's cash and the two-hundred-dollar mortgage on Henry 's farm less them five or six dollars or whatever they was where Henry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outhouse , was the same reason why Eula did n't quit Flem and marry De Spain : that staying married to Flem kept up a establishmentand a name for that gal that otherwise would n't a had either . So once that gal was married herself or leastwayssettled for good away from Jefferson so she would n't need Flem 's name and establishment no more , and in consequenceFlem would n't have no holt over her any more , Flem his-self would be on the outside trying to look back in and Flem knowed it . Only Lawyer did n't know it . He believed right up to the last that Flem was going to let him get Linda away from Jefferson to where the first strange young man that happenedby would marry her and then Eula could quit him and he would be finished . He  --  I mean Lawyer  --  had been giving her books to read ever since she was fourteen and then kind of holding examinations on them while the Coca-Cola ice melted . Then she was going on seventeen , next spring she would graduate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catalogues from the extra-select girls ' schools up there close to Harvard . Now the part comes that do nt nobody know except Lawyer , who naturally never told it . So as he his-self would say , you got to surmise from the facts in evidence : not jest the mind-improving books and the school catalogues accumulatinginto a dusty stack in his office , but the ice-cream sessions a thing of the past too . Because now she was going to and from school the back way , up alleys . Until finally in about a week maybe Lawyer realised that she was dodgingp139him . And she was going to graduate from high school in less than two months now and there was n't no time to waste . So that morning Lawyer went his-self to talk to her maw and he never told that neither so now we got to presume on a little more than jest evidence . Because my childhood too come out of that same similar Frenchman 's Bend backgroundand mill-yew that Flem Snopes had lifted his-self out of by his own unaided bootstraps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to do was jest to imagine my name was Flem Snopes and that the only holt I had on Will Varner 's money was through his daughter , and if I ever lost what light holt I had on the granddaughter , the daughter would be gone . Yet here was a durn meddling outsider with a complete set of plans that would remove that granddaughterto where I would n't never see her again , if she had any sense a-tall . And since the daughter had evidently put up with me for going on eighteen years now for the sake of that granddaughter , the answer was simple : all I needed to do was go to my wife and say , " If you give that gal permission to go away to school , I 'll blow up this-here entire Manfred de Spain business to where she wont have no home to have to get away from , let alone one to come back to for Christmas and holidays . " And for her first eighteen years Eula breathed that same Frenchman 's Bend mill-yew atmosphere too so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Eula Varner to know what she said back to Lawyer : " No , she cant go off to school but you can marry her . That will solve ever thing . " You see ? Because the kind of fidelity and devotion that could keep faithful and devoted that long without even wanting no bone any more , was not only too valuable to let get away , it even deserved to be rewarded . Because maybe the full rounded satisfaction and completeness of being Helen was bigger than a thousand Parises and McCarrons and De Spains could satisfy . I do n't mean jest the inexhaustible capacity for passion , but of power : the power not jest to draw and enchant and consume , but the power and capacityp140to give away and reward ; the power to draw to you , not more than you can handle because the words " cant-handle " and " Helen " ai nt even in the same language , but to draw to you so much more than you can possibly need that you could even afford to give the surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen and you cant give nothing away that was ever yourn : all you can do is share it and reward its fidelity and maybe even , for a moment , soothe and assuage its grief . And cruel too , prodigal in that too , because you are Helen and can afford it ; you got to be Helen to be that cruel , that prodigal in cruelty , and still be yourselfunscathed and immune , likely calling him by his first name for the first time too : " Marry her , Gavin . " And saw in his face not jest startlement and a little surpriselike he seen in Linda 's that time , but terror , fright , not at having to answer " No " that quick nor even at being asked it because he believed he had done already asked and decided that suh-jestion forever a long while back . It was at having it suh-jested to him by her . Like , since he had n't been able to have no hope since that moment when he realisedManfred de Spain had already looked at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace with hoping since he was the only one alive that knowed he never had none . But now , when she said that right out loud to his face , it was like she had said right out in public that he would n't a had no hope even if Manfred de Spain had n't never laid eyes on her . And if he could jest get that " No " out quick enough , it would be like maybe she had n't actively said what she said , and he would still not be destroyed . At least was n't nobody , no outsider , there to hear it so maybe even before next January he was able to believe had n't none of it even been said , like miracle : what ai nt believed ai nt seen . Miracle , pure miracle anyhow , how little a man needs to outlast jest about anything . Which  --  miracle  --  is about what looked like had happened next January : Linda graduated that spring from high school and next fall she entered the Seminary where she would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before so Flem could keep his hand on her . Then jest after Christmaswe heard how she had withdrawed from the Seminary and was going over to Oxford and enter the University . Yes sir , over there fifty miles from Flem day and night both right in the middle of a nest of five or six hundred bachelors under twenty-five years old any one of which could marry her that had two dollars for a license . A pure miracle , especially after I run into Eula on the street and says , " How did you manage it ? " and she says , " Manage what ? " and I says , " Persuade Flem to let her go to the University , " and she says , " I did n't . It was his idea . He gave the permission without even consulting me . I did n't know he was going to do it either . " Only the Frenchman 's Bend background should have been enough , without even needing the sixteen or seventeen years of Jefferson environment , to reveal even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that he preferred spot cash or at least a signed paper with a X on it . So when it was all over and finished , Eula dead and De Spain gone from Jefferson for good too and Flem was now president of the bank and even living in De Spain 's rejuvenatedancestral home and Linda gone with her New York husband to fight in the Spanish war , when Lawyer finally told me what little he actively knowed , it was jest evidence I had already presumed on . Because of course all Helen 's children would have to inherit something of generosity even if they could n't inherit more than about one millionth of their maw 's bounty to be generous with . Not to mention that McCarron boy , that even if he was n't durable enough to stand more than that-ere first creek bridge , was at least brave enough or rash enough to try to . So likely Flem alreadyknowed in advance that he would n't have to bargain , swap , with her . That all he needed was jest to do what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then had had them three months to settle down into having givep142up , then saying to her : " Let 's compromise . If you will give up them eastern schools , maybe you can go to the Universityover at Oxford . " You see ? Offering to give something that , in all the fourteen or fifteen years she could remember knowing him in , she had never dreamed he would do . Then that day in the next April ; she had been at the University over at Oxford since right after New Year 's . I was jest leaving for Rockyford to deliver Miz Ledbetter 's new sewing machine when Flem stopped me on the Square and offered me four bits extra to carry him by Varner 's store a minute . Urgent enough to pay me four bits when the mail carrier would have took him for nothing ; secret enough that he could n't risk either public conveyance : the mail carrier that would a took him out and back free but would a needed all day , or a hired automobile that would had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hour . Secret enough and urgent enough to have Will Varner storming into his daughter 's and son-in-law 's house in Jeffersonbefore daylight the next morning loud enough to wake up the whole neighborhood until somebody ( Eula naturally ) stopped him . So we got to presume on a few known facts again : that Old Frenchman place that Will deeded to Flem because he thought it was worthless until Flem sold it to me and Odum Bookwright and Henry Armstid ( less of course the active silver dollars Flem had had to invest into that old rose garden with a shovel where we  --  or any other Ratliffsand Bookwrights and Armstids that was handy  --  would find them ) . And that president 's chair in the bank that we knowed now Flem had had his eye on ever since Manfred de Spain taken it over after Colonel Sartoris . And that gal that had done already inherited generosity from her maw and then was suddenly give another gob of it that she not only never in the world expected but that she probably never knowed how bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . What Flem taken out to Frenchman 's Bend that day was a will . Maybe when Linda finally got over the shock ofp143getting permission to go away to school after she had long since give up any hope of it , even if no further away than Oxford , maybe when she looked around and realised who that permission had come from , she jest could not bear to be under obligations to him . Except I do nt believe that neither . It was n't even that little of bounty and generosity which would be all Helen 's child could inherit from her , since half of even Helen 's child would have to be corrupted by something less than Helen , being as even Helen could n't get a child on herself alone . What Linda wanted was not jest to give . It was to be needed : not jest to be loved and wanted , but to be needed too ; and maybe this was the first time in her life she ever had anything that anybody not jest wanted but needed too . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flem his-self could a suh-jested the idea to Linda ; it would n't a been difficult . Which I do n't believe neither . He did n't need to ; he knowed her well enough to presume on that , jest like she knowed him enough to presume too . It was Linda herself that evolved the idea when she realised that as long as he lived and drawed breath as Flem Snopes , he was n't never going to give her permission to leave Jefferson for any reason . And her asking herself , impotent and desperate : But why ? why ? until finally she answered it  --  a answer that maybe would n't a hell much water but she was jest sixteen and seventeen then , during which sixteen and seventeen years she had found out that the only thing he loved was money . Because she must a knowed something anyway about Manfred de Spain . Jefferson was n't that big , if in fact any place is . Not to mention them two or three weeks of summer holiday at the seashore or mountains or wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up but a old Jefferson neighbor happening by accident to take his vacation too from the bank at the same time and place . So what else would she say ? It 's grandfather 's money , that his one and only chance to keep any holt on it is through mama and me so he believes that once I get away from himp144his holt on both of us will be broken and mama will leave too and marry Manfred and any hope of grandfather 's money will be gone forever . Yet here was this man that had had sixteen or seventeen years to learn her he did n't love nothing but money and would do anything you could suh-jest to get another dollar of it , coming to her his-self , without no pressure from nobodyand not asking for nothing back , saying , You can go away to school if you still want to , only , this first time anyhowstay at least as close to home as Oxford ; saying in effect : I was wrong . I wont no longer stand between you and your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hope of your grandpaw 's money . So what else could she do but what she done , saying in effect back at him : If you jest realised now that grandfather'smoney ai nt as important as my life , I could a told you that all the time ; if you had jest told me two years ago that all you was was jest skeered , I would a eased you then  --  going ( Lawyer his-self told me this ) to a Oxford lawyer as soon as she was settled in the University and drawing up a will leaving whatever share she might ever have in her grandpaw 's or her maw 's estate to her father Flem Snopes . Sho , that would n't a held no water neither but she was jest eighteen and that was all she had to give that she thought anybody wanted or needed from her ; and besides , all the water it would need to hold would be what old Will Varner would sweat out when Flem showed it to him . So jest after ten that morning I stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour but at his front gate jest exactly long enough for Flem to get out and walk into the house until he coincided with Miz Varner I reckon it was and turn around and come back out and get back into the pickup and presumably at their two oclock a.m. morning family breakfast it occurred to Miz Varner or anyway she decided to or anyhow did hand Will the paper his son-in-law left yestiddy for him to look at . And by sunup Will had that whole Snopes street woke up hollering inside Flem 's housep145until Eula got him shut up . And by our normal ee-feet Jefferson breakfast time Manfred de Spain was there too . And that done it . Will Varner , that Flem had done already tricked outen that Old Frenchman place , then turned right around and used him again to get his-self and Manfred de Spain vice-president and president respectively of Colonel Sartoris 's bank , and now Flem had done turned back around the third time and somehow tricked his granddaughter into giving him a quit-claim to half of his active cash money that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . And Flem , that all he wanted was for Manfred de Spain to resign from the bank so he could be president of it and would jest as lief done it quiet and discreet and all private in the family you might say by a simple friendly suh-jestion from Will Varner to Manfred to resign from the bank , as a even swap for that paper of Linda 's , which should a worked with anybodyand would with anybody else except Manfred . He was the trouble ; likely Eula could a handled them all except for him . Maybe he got that-ere scar on his face by actively toting a flag up a hill in Cuba and running over a cannon or a fort with it , and maybe it come from the axe in that crap game that old mayor's-race rumor claimed . But leastwaysit was on his front and not on his back and so maybe a feller could knock him out with a piece of lead pipe and pick his pocket while he was laying there , but could n't no Snopes nor nobody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feller thought was a pistol . And Eula in the middle of them , that likely could a handled it all except for Manfred , that had even made Will shut up but she could n't make Manfred hush . That had done already spent lacking jest a week of nineteen years holding together a home for Linda to grow up and live in so she would n't never need to say , Other children have got what I never had ; there was Eula having to decide right there right now , If I was a eighteen-year-old gal , which would I rather have : my mother publicly notarised as a suicide , or publicly condemned as a whore ? and by noonp146the next day all Jefferson knowed how the afternoon before she come to town and went to the beauty parlor that had n't never been in one before because she never needed to , and had her hair waved and her fingernails shined and went back home and presumably et supper or anyhow was present at it since it was n't until about eleven oclock that she seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the next morning Lawyer and his sister drove over to Oxford and brought Linda home ; a pure misfortunate coincidence that all this had to happen jest a week before her nineteenth birthday . But as soon as Flem received that will from her , naturally he figgered Will Varner would want to see it as soon as possible , being a interested party ; it was Will that never had no reason a-tall to pick out that special day to come bellering in to town two hours after he first seen it . He could a jest as well waited two weeks or even a month to come in , since was n't nobody hurrying him ; Flem would certainly a waited on his convenience . And Lawyer that tended to the rest of it too : arranged for the funeral and sent out to Frenchman 's Bend for Miz Varner and the old Methodist preacher that had baptised Eula , and then seen to the grave . Because naturally the bereavedhusband could n't be expected to break into his grief jest to do chores . Not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a decent interval , being as Manfred de Spain his-self had packed up and departed from Jefferson right after the burying . And then , after another decorious interval , a little longer this time being as a bank ai nt like jest a house because a bank deals with active cash money and cant wait , getting ready to move into De Spain 's house too since De Spain had give ever evident intention of not aiming to return to Jefferson from this last what you might still call Varner trip and there was n't no use in letting a good sound well-situated house stand vacant and empty . Which  --  De Spain 's house  --  was likely a part of that same swapping and trading between Flem and Will Varner that included Varner 's bank-stock votes and that-ere financialp147Midsummer Night 's Dream masque or rondeau that Linda and that Oxford lawyer composed betwixt them that had Linda 's signature on it . Not to mention Lawyer being appointedby old man Will to be trustee of Linda 's money since it was now finally safe from Flem until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will appointingLawyer for the reason that likely he could n't pass by Lawyer to get to no one else , Lawyer being not only in the middle of that entire monetary and sepulchrial crisis but all around ever part of it too , like one of them frantic water bugs skating and rushing immune and unwettable on top of a stagnant pond . I mean , Lawyer was now busy over the headstone Flem had decided on . Because it would have to be made in Italy , which would take time , and so would demand ever effort on Lawyer 's part before Linda could pack up and leave Jefferson too , being as Flem felt that that same filial decorum demanded that Linda wait until her maw 's headstone was up and finished before leaving . Only I do nt mean jest headstone : I mean monument : Lawyer combing and currying not jest Jefferson and Frenchman 's Bend but most of the rest of Yoknapatawpha County too , hunting out ever photographof Eula he could locate to send to Italy so they could carve Eula 's face in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed again how there ai nt nobody quite as temerious as a otherwise timid feller that finds out that his moral standardsand principles is now demanding him to do something that , if all he had to depend on was jest his own satisfaction and curiosity , he would n't a had the brass to do , penetrating into ever house that not only might a knowed Eula but that jest had a Brownie Kodak , thumbing through albums and intimate photographic family records , courteous and polite of course but jest a man obviously not in no condition to be said No to , let alone merely Please do nt . He could keep busy now . Because he was contented and happy now , you see . He never had nothing to worry him now . Eula was safely gone now and now he could be safep148forevermore from ever again having to chew his bitter poetic thumbs over the constant anticipation of who would turn up next named McCarron or De Spain . And now Linda was not only safe for good from Flem , he , Lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her maw and grandpaw , so that now she could go anywhere she wanted  --  providingof course he could nag and harry them folks across the water to finish carving that face before the millennium or judgment day come , gathering up all the pictures of Eula he could find and sending them to Italy and then waiting until a drawing or a photograph of how the work was comingalong would get back for him to see jest how wrong it was , and he would send me word to be at his office at a certain hour for the conference , with the newest fresh Italian sketch or photograph laid out on the desk with a special light on it and him saying , " It 's the ear , or the line of the jaw , or the mouth  --  right here : see what I mean ? " and I would say , " It looks all right to me . It looks beautiful to me . " And he would say , " No . It 's wrong right here . Hand me a pencil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't draw neither so he would have to rub that out and try again . Except that time was passing so he would have to send it back ; and Flem and Linda living in De Spain 's house now and now Flem had done bought a automobile that he could n't drive but anyhow he had a daughter that could , leastways now and then ; until at last even that was over . It was October and Lawyer sent me word the unveiling at the graveyard would be that afternoon . Except I had done already got word to Chick , since from the state of peace and contentmentLawyer had got his-self into by this time , it might take both of us . So Chick stayed outen school that afternoon so all three of us went out to the cemetery together in Lawyer 's car . And there was Linda and Flem too , in Flem 's car with the Negro driver that was going to drive her on to Memphis to take the New York train with her packed grips alreadyp149in the car , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that even after five years still did n't look like it actively belonged to him , chewing , and Linda beside him in her dark going-away dress and hat with her head bent a little and them little white gloves shut into fists on her lap . And there it was : that-ere white monument with on the front of it that face that even if it was carved outen dead stone , was still the same face that ever young man no matter how old he got would still never give up hope and belief that some day before he died he would finally be worthy to be wrecked and ruined and maybe even destroyed by it , above the motto that Flem his-self had picked : A Virtuous Wife Is a Crown to Her HusbandHer Children Rise and Call Her BlessedUntil at last Flem leaned out the window and spit and then set back in the car and tells her : " All right . You can go now . " Yes sir , Lawyer was free now . He never had nothing to worry him now : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and him talking about how the game of football could be brought up to date in keeping with the progress of the times by giving ever body a football too so ever body would be in the game ; or maybe better still , keep jest one football but abolish the boundaries so that a smart feller for instance could hide the ball under his shirttail and slip off into the bushes and circle around town and come in through a back alley and cross the goal before anybody even missed he was gone ; right on into the office where he set down behind the desk and taken up one of the cob pipes and struck three matches to it until Chick taken it away from him and filled it from the tobacco jar and handed it back and Lawyer says , " Much obliged , " and dropped the filled pipe into the wastebasket and folded his hands on the desk , still talking , and I says to Chick : " Watch him . I wo n't be long , " and went around into the  |p150was  pretty bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment anyhow would feel like alcohol . And I got the sugar bowl and glass and spoon from the cabinet and made the toddy and set it on the desk by him and he says , " Much obliged , " not even touching it , jest setting there with his hands folded in front of him , blinking quick and steady like he had sand in his eyes , saying : " All us civilised people date our civilisation from the discovery of the principle of distillation . And even though the rest of the world , at least that part of it in the United States , rates us folks in Mississippi at the lowest rung of culture , what man can deny that , even if this is as bad as I think it 's going to be , we too grope toward the stars ? Why did she do it , V.K. ? That  --  all that  --  that she walked in , lived in , breathed in  --  it was only loaned to her ; it was n't hers to destroy and throw away . It belonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , V.K. ? " he says . " Why ? " " Maybe she was bored , " I says , and he says : " Bored . Yes , bored . " And that was when he begun to cry . " She loved , had the capacity to love , to give and to take it . Only she tried twice and failed twice not jest to find somebody strong enough to deserve it but even brave enough to accept it . Yes , " he says , setting there bolt uprightwith jest the tears running down his face , at peace now , with nothing nowhere in the world any more to anguishor grieve him . " Of course she was bored . "  |p151So  he was free . He had not only got shut of his sireen , he had even got shut of the ward he found out she had heired to him . Because I says , " Grinnich Village ? " and he says , " Yes .

" Except I says , " Except she never had to leave Missippi to locate that place . " And then I said it , what Eula herself must have , had to have , said to him that . day : " Why did n't you marry her ? " " Because she was n't but nineteen , " he says . " And you are all of thirty-five , ai nt you , " I says . " When the papers are full of gals still carrying a doll in one hand marrying folks of sixty and seventy , providing of course they got a little extra money . " " I mean , she 's got too much time left to run into somethingwhere she might need me . How many papers are full of people that got married because someday they might need the other one ? " " Oh , " I says . " So all you got to do now is jest stay around close where you can hear the long-distance telephoneor the telegram boy can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to ever come back to Missippi . Or maybe you are ? " " Naturally not , " he says . " Why should she ? " " Thank God ? " I says . He did n't answer . " Because who knows , " I says , " she may done already found that dream even in jest these . . . two days , ai nt it ? three ? Maybe he was already settled there when she arrived . That 's possible in Grinnich Village , ai nt it ? " Then he said it too . " Yes , " he says , " thank God . " So he was free . And in fact , when you had time to look around a little , he never had nothing no more to do but jest rest in peace and quiet and contentment . Because not only himp152but all Jefferson was free of Snopeses ; for the first time in going on twenty years , Jefferson and Yoknapatawpha County too was in what you might call a kind of Snopes doidrum . Because at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last in the same chair the presidents of the Merchants and Farmers Bank had been setting in ever since the first one , Colonel Sartoris , started it twenty-odd years ago , and actively living in the very house the second one of it was born in , so that all he needed to do too after he had done locked up the money and went home was to live in solitary peace and quiet and contentment too , not only shut of the daughter that had kept him on steady and constant tenterhooks for years whether she might not escape at any moment to where he could n't watch her and the first male feller that come along would marry her and he would lose her share of Will Varner 's money , but shut of the wife that at any time her and Manfred de Spain would get publicly caught up with and cost him all the rest of Varner 's money and bank voting stock too . In fact , for the moment Hem was the only true Snopes actively left in Jefferson . Old man Ab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out where you could jest barely see the water tank , where he taken the studs that day back about 1910 and had n't moved since . And four years ago Flem had ci-devanted I.O. back to Frenchman 's Bend for good . And even before that Hem had eliminated MontgomeryWard into the penitentiary at Parchman where Mink already was ( Mink had n't really resided in Jefferson nohow except jest them few months in the jail waiting for his life sentence to be awarded ) . And last month them four halfSnopesIndians that Byron Snopes , Colonel Sartoris 's bank clerk that resigned by the simple practical expedient of pickingup as much of the loose money he could tote and striking for the nearest U.S. border , sent back collect from Mexico until somebody could get close enough to fasten the return prepaid tags on them before whichever one had it at the moment could get out that switch-blade knife . And as forp153Eck 's boys , Wallstreet Panic and Admiral Dewey , they had n't never been Snopeses to begin with , since all Wallstreetevidently wanted to do was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jest selling ever body exactly what they thought they was buying , for exactly what they thought they was going to pay for it . Or almost satisfied that is . I mean Flem and his new house . It was jest a house : two-storey , with a gallery for Major de Spain , Manfred 's paw , to set on when he was n't fishing or hunting or practising a little law , and it was all right for that-ere second president of the Merchants and Farmers Bank to live in , especially since he had been born in it . But this was a different president . His road to that chair and that house had been longer than them other two . Likely he knowed he had had to come from too fur away to get where he was , and had to come too hard to reach it by the time he did . Because Colonel Sartoris had been born into money and respectability too , and Manfred de Spain had been born into respectability at least even if he had made a heap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had to earn both of them , snatch and tear and scrabble both of them oaten the hard enduring resisting rock you might say , not jest with his bare hands but with jest one bare hand since he had to keep the other bare single hand fending off while he tore and scrabbled with the first one . So the house the folks owning the money would see Manfred de Spain walk into ever evening after he locked the money up and went home , would n't be enough for Flem Snopes . The house they would see him walk into ever evening until time to unlockthe money tomorrow morning , would have to be the physical symbol of all them generations of respectability and aristocracy that not only would a been too proud to mishandle other folks ' money , but could n't possibly ever needed to . So there was another Snopes in Jefferson after all . Not transplanted in from Frenchman 's Bend : jest imported inp154for temporary use . This was Wat Snopes , the carpenter , Watkins Products Snopes his full name was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Doc Meeks 's patentmedicinetruck ; evidently there was a Snopes somewhere now and then that could read reading , whether he could read writing or not . So during the next nine or ten months anybody that had or could think up the occasion , could pass along the street and watch Wat and his work gang of kinfolksand in-laws tearing off Major de Spain 's front gallery and squaring up the back of the house and building and setting up them colyums to reach all the way from the ground up to the second-storey roof , until even when the painting was finished it still would n't be as big as Mount Vernon of course , but then Mount Vernon was a thousand miles away so there was n't no chance of invidious or maliciouseye-to-eye comparison . So that when he locked up the bank and come home in the evening he could walk into a house and shut the door that the folks owning the money he was custodian of would some of them be jealous a little but all of them , even the jealous ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying down to rest undisturbed at night with their money that immaculate , that impeccable , that immune . He was completely complete , as the feller says , with a Negro cook and a yard boy that could even drive that-ere automobilenow and then since he no longer had a only daughter to drive it maybe once a month to keep the battery up like the man told him he would have to do or buy a new one . But it was jest the house that was altered and transmogrifiedand symbolised : not him . The house he disappeared into about four p.m. ever evening until about eight a.m. tomorrow , might a been the solid aristocratic ancestral symbolof Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr and Astor and Morgan and Harriman and Hill and ever other golden advocateof hard quick-thinking vested interest , but the feller the owners of that custodianed money seen going and corningout of it was the same one they had done got accus/tomed to for twenty years now : the same little snap-on bow tie he had got outen the Frenchman 's Bend mule wagon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that old cloth cap , that maybe was plenty good enough to be Varner'sclerk in but that was n't to be seen going in and out of a Jefferson bank on the head of its vice-president -- -even the cap not throwed away or even give away , but sold , even if it was n't but jest a dime because ten cents is money too around a bank , so that all the owners of that money that he was already vice-custodian of could look at the hat and know that , no matter how little they might a paid for one similar to it , hisn had cost him ten cents less . It was n't that he rebelled at changing Flem Snopes : he done it by deliberatecalculation , since the feller you trust ai nt necessarily the one you never knowed to do nothing untrustable : it 's the one you have seen from experience that he knows exactlywhen being untrustable will pay a net profit and when it will pay a loss . And that was jest the house on the outside too , up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind him until eight oclock tomorrow . And he had n't never invitednobody in , and so far had n't nobody been able to invent no way in , so the only folks that ever seen the inside of it was the cook and the yardman and so it was the yardmanthat told me : all them big rooms furnished like De Spain left them , plus them interior-decorated sweets the Memphis expert learned Eula that being vice-president of a bank he would have to have ; that Flem never even went into them except to eat in the dining room , except that one room at the back where when he was n't in the bed sleeping he was setting in another swivel chair like the one in the bank , with his feet propped against the side of the fireplace : not reading , not doing nothing : jest setting with his hat on , chewing that same little mouth-sized chunk of air he had been chewing ever since he quit tobacco when he finally got to Jefferson and heard about chewing gum and then quit chewing gum too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich enough not to have to chew anything . And how Wat Snopes had found a picture in a magazine how to do over all the fireplaces with colonial molding and colyums and cornices too and at first Flem would jest set with his feet propped on the white paint , scratching it a little deeper ever day with the pegs in his heels . Until one day about a year after the house was finishedover , Wat Snopes was there to eat dinner and after Wat finally left the yardman said how he went into the room and seen it : not a defiance , not a simple reminder of where he had come from but rather as the feller says a reaffirmationof his-self and maybe a warning to his-sell too : a little wood ledge , not even painted , nailed to the front of that hand-carved hand-painted Mount Vernon mantelpiece at the exact height for Flem to prop his feet on it . And time was when that first president , Colonel Sartoris , had come the four miles between his ancestral symbol and his bank in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a linen duster and one of the Colonel 's old plug hats ; and time ai nt so was when the second president still come and went in that fire-engine-colored E.M.F. racer until he bought that black Packard and a Negro too except in a white coat and a showfer 's cap to drive it . This here new third president had a black automobile too even if it was n't a Packard , and a Negro that could drive it too even if he never had no white coat and showfer 's cap yet and even if the president did n't ride back and forth to the bank or at least not yet . Them two previous presidents would ride around the county in the evening after the bank closed and on Sunday , in that surrey and pair or the black Packard , to look at the cotton farms they represented the mortgages on , while this new president had n't commenced that neither . Which was n't because he jest could n't believe yet that he actively represented the mortgages . He never doubted that . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too meek to nor doubtful to . It was because he was watching yet and learning yet . It was n't that he had learned two lessons whilep157he thought he was jest learning that single one about how he would need respectability , because he had done already brought that second lesson in from Frenchman 's Bend with him . That was humility , the only kind of humility that 's worth a hoot : the humility to know they 's a heap of things you do nt know yet but if you jest got the patience to be humble and watchful long enough , especially keeping one eye on your back trail , you will . So now on the evenings and Sundays there was jest that house where you was n't invitedin to see him setting in that swivel chair in that one room he used , with his hat on and chewing steady on nothingand his feet propped on that little wooden additional ledge nailed in unpainted paradox to that hand-carved and - painted mantel like one of them framed mottoes you keep hanging on the wall where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Working or God is Love to remind not jest you but the strangers that see it too , that you got at least a speaking acquaintance with the fact that it might be barely possible it taken a little something more than jest you to get you where you 're at . But all that , footrest and all , would come later . Right now , Lawyer was free . And then  --  it was n't no three days after Linda reached New York , but it was n't no three hundredneither  --  he become , as the feller says , indeed free . He was leaning against the counter in the post-office lobby with the letter already open in his hand when I come in ; it was n't his fault neither that the lobby happened to be empty at the moment . " His name is Barton Kohl , " he says . " Sho now , " I says . " Whose name is ? " " That dream 's name , " he says . " Cole , " I says . " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's spelled K-o-h-1 . " " Oh , " I says . " Kohl . That do nt sound very American to me . " " Does Vladimir Kyrilytch sound very American to you ? " " "  |p158But  the lobby was empty . Which , as I said , was n't his fault . " Confound it , " I says , " with one Ratliff in ever generationfor them whole hundred and fifty years since your durn Yankee Congress banished us into the Virginia mountains , has had to spend half his life trying to live down his front name before somebody spoke it out loud where folks could hear it . It was Eula told you . " " All right , " he says . " I 'll help you bury your family shame .  --  Yes , " he says . " He 's a Jew . A sculptor , probably a damned good one . " " Because of that ? " I says . " Probably , but not exclusively . Because of her . " " Linda 'll make him into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she married him ? " " No . He would have to be the best of whatever he was for her to pick him out . " " So she 's married now , " I says . " What ? " he says . " No . She just met him , I tell you . " " So you ai nt  --  " I almost said safe yet before I changed it : "  --  sure yet . I mean , she ai nt decided yet . " " What the hell else am I talking about ? Do nt you remember what I told you last fall ? that she would love once and it would be for keeps ? " " Except that you said doomed to . ' " " All right , " he says . " Doomed to fidelity and grief , you said . To love once quick and lose him quick and for the rest of her life to be faithful and to grieve . But leastways she ai nt lost him yet . In fact , she ai nt even got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Did n't I say all right ? " he says . That was the first six months , about . Another year after that , that-ere little footrest ledge was up on that handpaintedMount Vernon mantel  --  that-ere little raw wood step like out of a scrap pile , nailed by a country carpenter onto that what you might call respectability 's virgin Matterhornfor the Al-pine climber to cling to panting , gathering his-self for that last do-or-die upsurge to deface the ultimatep159crowning pinnacle and peak with his own victorious initials . But not this one ; and here was that humility again : not in public where it would be a insult to any and all that held Merchants and Farmers Bank Al-pine climbing in veneration , but in private like a secret chapel or a shrine : not to cling panting to it , desperate and indomitable , but to prop his feet on it while setting at his ease . This time I was passing the office stairs when Lawyer come rushing around the corner as usual , with most of the law papers flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them still in his hand too as usual . I mean , he had jest two gaits : one standing more or less still and the other like his coattail was on fire . " Run back home and get your grip , " he says . " We 're leaving Memphis tonight for New York . " So we went up the stairs and as soon as we was inside the office he changed to the other gait as usual . He throwed the loose papers onto the desk and taken one of the cob pipes outen the dish and set down , only when he fumbled in his coat for the matches or tobacco or whatever it was he discovered the rest of the papers and throwed them onto the desk and set back in the chair like he had done already had all the time in the world and could n't possibly anticipate nothing else happening in the next hundred years neither . " For the housewarming , " he says . " You mean the reception , do nt you ? Ai nt that what they call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't say anything , jest setting there working at lighting that pipe like a jeweler melting one exact drop of platinum maybe into a watch . " So they ai nt going to marry , " I says . " They 're jest going to confederate . I 've heard that : that that 's why they call them Grinnich Village samples dreams : you can wake up without having to jump outen the bed in a dead run for the nearest lawyer . " He did n't move . He jest bristled , that lively and quick he never had time to change his position . He set there and bristled like a hedgehog , not moving of course : jest sayingp160cold and calm , since even a hedgehog , once it has got itself arranged and prickled out , can afford a cold and calm collectedvoice too : " All right . I 'll arrogate the term marriage ' to it then . Do you protest or question it ? Maybe you would even suggest a better one ?  --  Because there 's not enough time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's none left . Young people today do nt have any left because only fools under twenty-five can believe , let alone hope , that there 's any left at all  --  for any of us , anybody alive today  --  " " It do nt take much time to say We both do in front of a preacher and then pay him whatever the three of you figger it 's worth . " " Did n't I just say there 's not even that much left if all you 've had is just twenty-five or thirty years  --  " " So that 's how old he is , " I says . " You stopped at jest twenty-five before . " He did n't stop at nowhere now : " Barely a decade since their fathers and uncles and brothers just finished the one which was to rid the phenomenon of government forever of the parasites  --  the hereditary proprietors , the farmers-generalof the human dilemma who had just killed eight millionhuman beings and ruined a forty-mile-wide strip down the middle of western Europe . Yet less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even botheringto change their names and faces but merely assuming a set of new titles out of the shibboleth of the democratic lexicon and its mythology , not even breaking stride to coalesceagain to wreck the one doomed desperate hope  --  " Now he will resume the folks that broke President Wilson 's heart and killed the League of Nations I thought , but he was the one that did n't even break stride : " That one already in Italy and one a damned sight more dangerous in Germanybecause all Mussolini has to work with are Italians while this other man has Germans . And the one in Spain that all he needs is to be let alone a little longer by the rest of us who still believe that if we just keep our eyes closed long enough it will all go away . Not to mention  --  "  | " Not to mention the one in Russia , " I said. "  --  the ones right here at home : the organizations with the fine names confederated in unison in the name of God against the impure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnology and religion : K.K.K. and Silver Shirts ; not to mention the indigenous local champions like Long in Louisiana and our own Bilbo in Mississippi , not to mention our very own Senator Clarence Egglestone Snopes right here in Yoknapatawpha County  --  " " Not to mention the one in Russia , " I says . " What ? " he says . " So that 's why , " I says . " He ai nt jest a sculptor . He 's a communist too . " " What ? " Lawyer says . " Barton Kohl . The reason they did n't marry first is that Barton Kohl is a communist . He cant believe in churches and marriage . They wont let him . " " He wanted them to marry , " Lawyer says . " It 's Linda that wont . " So now it was me that said What ? and him setting there fierce and untouchable as a hedgehog . " You do nt believe that ? " he says . " Yes , " I says . " I believe it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she have ever seen in the one she had to look at for nineteen years , to make her want any part of it ? " " All right , " I says . " All right . Except that 's the one I do nt believe . I believe the first one , about there ai nt enough time left . That when you are young enough , you can believe . When you are young enough and brave enough at the same time , you can hate intolerance and believe in hope and , if you are sho enough brave , act on it . " He still looked at me . " I wish it was me , " I says . " Not just to marry somebody , but to marry anybody just so it 's marriage . Just so it 's not adultery . Even you . " " Not that , " I says . " I wish I was either one of them . To believe in intolerance and hope and act on it . At any price . Even at having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even to being a thirty-year-old Grinnich Village sculptor like he is . " " So you do refuse to believe that all she wants is to cuddle up together and be what she calls happy . " " Yes , " I says . " So do I. " So I did n't go that time , not even when he said : " Nonsense . Come on . Afterward we will run up to Saratogaand look at that ditch or hill or whatever it was where your first immigrant Vladimir Kyrilytch Ratliff ancestor entered your native land . " " He was n't no Ratliff then yet , " I says . " We do nt know what his last name was . Likely Nelly Ratliff could n't even spell that one , let alone pronounce it . Maybe in fact neither could he . Besides , it was n't even Ratliff then . It was Ratcliffe .  --  No , " I says , " jest you will be enough . You can get cheaper corroboration than one that will not only need a round-trip ticket but three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he says . " At this serious moment in her life when she is fixing to officially or leastways formally confederate or shack up with a gentleman friend of the opposite sex as the feller says , ai nt the reason for this trip to tell her and him at last who she is ? or leastways who she ai nt ? " Then I says , " Of course . She already knows , " and he says , " How could she help it ? How could she have lived in the same house with Flem for nineteen years and still believe he could possibly be her father , even if she had incontrovertibleproof of it ? " " And you ai nt never told her , " I says . Then I says , " It 's even worse than that . Whenever it occurs to her enough to maybe fret over it a little and she comes to you and says maybe , Tell me the truth now . He ai nt my father , ' she can always depend on you saying , You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence and need you was speaking of ? " Now he was n't looking at me . " What would you do if she got it turned around backwards and said to you , Who is my father ? ' " No , he was n't looking at me . " That 's right , " Ip163says . " She wont never ask that . I reckon she has done watched Gavin Stevens too , enough to know there 's some lies even he ought not to need to cope with . " He was n't looking at me a-tall . " So that there dependence is on a round-trip ticket too , " I says . He was back after ten days . And I thought how maybe if that sculptor could jest ketch her unawares , still half asleep maybe , and seduce her outen the bed and up to a altar or even jest a j.p . before she noticed where she was at , maybe he  --  Lawyer  --  would be free . Then I knowed that was n't even wishful thinking because there was n't nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because once I got rid of them hopeful cobwebs I realised I must a knowed for years what likely Eula knowed the moment she laid eyes on him : that he would n't never be free because he would n't never want to be free because this was his life and if he ever lost it he would n't have nothing left . I mean , the right and privilege and opportunity to dedicate forever his capacity for responsibility to something that would n't have no end to its appetite and that would n't never threaten to give him even a bone back in recompense . And I remembered what he said back there about how she was doomed to fidelity and monogamy  --  to love once and lose him and then to grieve , and I said I reckoned so , that being Helen of Troy 's daughter was kind of like being say the ex-Pope of Rome or the ex-Emperor of Japan : there was n't much future to it . And I knowed now he was almost right , he jest had that word " doomed " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doomed , she would likely do fine ; it was the one that was recipient of the fidelity and the monogamy and the love , and the one that was the proprietor of the responsibilitythat never even wanted , let alone expected , a bone back , that was the doomed one ; and how even between them two the lucky one might be the one that had the roof fall on him while he was climbing into or out of the bed . So naturally I would a got a fur piece quick trying to tell him that , so naturally my good judgment told me not top164try it . And so partly by jest staying away from him but mainly by fighting like a demon , like Jacob with his angel , I finally resisted actively saying it  --  a temptation about as strong as a human man ever has to face , which is to deliberatelythrow away the chance to say afterward , " I told you so . " So time passed . That little additional mantelpiece footrestwas up now that had n't nobody ever seen except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to me and him ( likely ) and me both happened to mention it in turn to some of our close intimates : a part of the Snopes legend and another Flem Snopes monument in that series mounting on and up from that water tank that we never knowed yet if they had got out of it all that missing Flem Snopes regime powerhouse brass them two mad skeered Negro firemen put into it . Then it was 1936 and there was less and less of that time left : Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in Germany and sho enough , like Lawyer said , that one in Spain too ; Lawyer said , " Pack your grip . We will take the airplane from Memphistomorrow morning .  --  No no , " he says , " you do nt need to fear contamination from association this time . They 're going to be married . They 're going to Spain to join the Loyalistarmy and apparently he nagged and worried at her until . at last she probably said , Oh hell , have it your way then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced-thinking artist after all , " I says . " He was jest another ordinary man that believed if a gal was worth sleeping with she was worth deserving to have a roof over her head and something to eat and a little money in her pocket for the balance of her life . " " All right , " he says . " All right . " " Except we 'll go on the train , " I says . " It ai nt that I 'm jest simply skeered to go in a airplane : it 's because when we go across Virginia I can see the rest of the place where thaterefirst immigrant Vladimir Kyrilytch worked his way into the United States . " So I was already on the corner with my grip when he drove up and stopped and opened the doorp165and looked at me and then done what the moving pictures call a double take and says , " Oh hell . " " It 's mine , " I says . " I bought it . " " You , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on before , let alone owned one , in your life . " " You told me why . It 's a wedding . " " Take it off , " he says . " No , " I says . " I wont travel with you . I wont be seen with you . " " No , " I says . " Maybe it ai nt jest the wedding . I 'm going back to let all them V. K. Ratliff beginnings look at me for the first time . Maybe it 's them I 'm trying to suit . Or leastwaysnot to shame . " So we taken the train in Memphis that night and the next day we was in Virginia  --  Bristol then Roanoke and Lynchburg and turned northeast alongside the blue mountains and somewhere ahead , we did n't know jest where , was where that first Vladimir Kyrilytch finally found a place where he could stop , that we did n't know his last name or maybe he did n't even have none until Nelly Ratliff , spelled Ratcliffe then , found him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them hired German regiments in General Burgoyne 's army that got licked at Saratoga except that Congress refused to honor the terms of surrender and banished the whole kit-and-biling of them to straggle for six years in Virginia without no grub nor money and the ones like that first V.K. without no speech neither . But he never needed none of the three of them to escape not only in the right neighborhood but into the exact right hayloft where Nelly Ratcliffe , maybe hunting eggs or such , would find him . And never needed no language to eat the grub she toted him ; and maybe he never knowed nothing about farming before the day when she finally brought him out where her folks could see him ; nor never needed no speech to speak of for the next development , which was when somebody  --  her maw or paw or brothers or whoever it was , maybe jest a neighbor  --  noticed the size of her belly ;  |p166and  so they was married and so that V.K. actively did have a active legal name of Ratcliffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one after him moved to Missippi , except that by that time it was spelled Ratliff , where the oldest son is still named Vladimir Kyrilytch and still spends half his life trying to keep anybody from finding it out . The next morning we was in New York . It was early ; not even seven oclock yet . It was too early . " Likely they ai nt even finished breakfast yet , " I says . " Breakfast hell , " Lawyer says . " They have n't even gone to bed yet . This is New York , not Yoknapatawpha County . " So we went to the hotel where Lawyer had already engaged a room . Except it was n't a room , it was three of them : a parlor and two bedrooms . " We can have breakfast up here too , " he says . " Breakfast ? " I says . " They 'll send it up here . " " This is New York , " I says . " I can eat breakfast in the bedroom or kitchen or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downstairs to the dining room . Then I says , " What time do they eat breakfast then ? Sundown ? Or is that jest when they get up ? " " No , " he says . " We got a errand first .  --  No , " he says , " we got two errands . " He was looking at it again , though I will have to do him the justice to say he had n't mentioned it again since that first time when I got in the car back in Jefferson . And I remember how he told me once how maybe New York was n't made for no climate known to man but at least some weather was jest made for New York . In which case , this was sholy some of it : one of them soft blue drowsy days in the early fall when the sky itself seems like it was resting on the earth like a soft blue mist , with the tall buildings rushing up into it and then stopping , the sharp edges fading like the sunshine was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires singing . Then I seen it : a store , with a show window , a entire show window with not nothing in it but one necktie.  | " Wait , " I says . " No , " he says . " It was all right as long as just railroad conductors looked at it but you cant face a preacher in it . " " No , " I says , " wait . " Because I had heard about these New York side-alley stores too . " If it takes that whole show window to deserve jest one necktie , likely they will want three or four dollars for it . " " We cant help it now , " he says . " This is New York . Come on . " And nothing inside neither except some gold chairs and two ladies in black dresses and a man dressed like a congressmanor at least a preacher , that knowed Lawyer by active name . And then a office with a desk and a vase of flowers and a short dumpy dark woman in a dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the handsomest dark eyes I ever seen even if they was popped a little , that kissed Lawyer and then he said to her , " Myra Allanovna , this is Vladimir Kyrilytch , " and she looked at me and said something ; yes , I know it was Russian , and Lawyer saying : " Look at it . Just once if you can bear it , " and I says , " Sholy it ai nt quite as bad as that . Of course I had ruther it was yellow and red instead of pink and green . But all the same  --  " and she says , " You like yellow and red ? " " Yessum , " I says . Then I says , " In fact " before I could stop , and she says , " Yes , tell me , " and I says , " Nothing . I was jest thinking that if you could jest imagine a necktie and then pick it right up and put it on , I would imagine one made outen red with a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " and she says , " Sunflower ? " and Lawyer says , " Helianthe . " Then he says , " No , that 's wrong . Tournesol . Sonnenblume , " and she says Wait and was already gone , and now I says Wait myself . " Even a five-dollar necktie could n't support all them gold chairs "  | " It 's too late now , " Lawyer says . " Take it off . " Except that when she come back , it not only never had no sunflower , it was n't even red . It was jest dusty . No , that was wrong ; you had looked at it by that time . It looked like the outside of a peach , that you know that in a minute , providingyou can keep from blinking , you will see the first beginning of when it starts to turn peach . Except that it do nt do that . It 's still jest dusted over with gold , like the back of a sunburned gal . " Yes , " Lawyer says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He never wore a white shirt before either . " " No , never , " she says . " Always blue , not ? And this blue , always ? The same blue as your eyes ? " " That 's right , " I says . " But how ? " she says . " By fading them ? By just washing them ? " " That 's right , " I says . " I jest washes them . " " You mean , you wash them ? Yourself ? " " He makes them himself too , " Lawyer says . " That 's right , " I says . " I sells sewing machines . First thing I knowed I could run one too . " " Of course , " she says . " This one for now . Tomorrow , the other one , red with sonnenblume . " Then we was outside again . I was still trying to say Wait . " Now I got to buy two of them , " I says . " I 'm trying to be serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as serious right now as ere a man in your experience . Jest exactly how much you reckon was the price on that one in that window ? " And Lawyer not even stopping , saying over his shoulder in the middle of folks pushing past and around us in both directions : " I do nt know . Her ties run up to a hundred and fifty . Say , seventy-five dollars  --  " It was exactly like somebody had hit me a quick light lick with the edge of his hand across the back of the neck until next I knowed I was leaningagainst the wall back out of the rush of folks in a fit of weak trembles with Lawyer more or less holding me up . " You all right now ? " he says.  | " No I ai nt , " I says . " Seventy-five dollars for a necktie ? I cant ! I wont ! " " You 're forty years old , " he says . " You should a been buying at the minimum one tie a year ever since you fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven ? twelve ? thirteen ? Or maybe it was eight or nine , when you first went to school  --  provided the first-grade teacher was female of course . But even call it twenty . That 's twenty years , at one dollar a tie a year . That 's twenty dollars . Since you are not married and never will be and do nt have any kin close enough to exhaust and wear you out by taking care of you or hoping to get anything out of you , you may live another forty-five . That 's sixty-five dollars . That means you will have an Allanovna tie for only ten dollars . Nobody else in the world ever got an Allanovna tie for ten dollars . " " I wont ! " I says . " I wont ! " " All right . I 'll make you a present of it then . " " I cant do that , " I says . " All right . You want to go back there and tell her you do nt want the tie ? " " Do nt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he says . " Come on . We 're already a little late . " So when we got to this hotel we went straight to the saloon . " We 're almost there , " I says . " Cant you tell me yet who it 's going to be ? " " No , " he says . " This is New York . I want to have a little fun and pleasure too . " And a moment later , when I realised that Lawyer had n't never laid eyes on him before , I should a figgered why he had insisted so hard on me coming on this trip . Except that I remembered how in this case Lawyer would n't need no help since you are bound to have some kind of affinity of outragement anyhow for the man that for twenty-five years has been as much a part and as big a part of your simple natural normal anguish of jest having to wake up again tomorrow , as this one had . So I says , " I 'll be durned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little gray at the temples , with not jest a sunburned outdoorsp170look but a rich sunburned outdoors look that never needed that-ere dark expensive-looking city suit , let alone two waiters jumping around the table where he was at , to prove it , alreadysetting there where Lawyer had drawed him from wherever it was out west he had located him , the same as he had drawed me for this special day . No , it was n't Lawyer that had drawed McCarron and me from a thousand miles away and two thousand more miles apart , the three of us to meet at this moment in a New York saloon : it was that gal that done it  --  that gal that never had seen one of us and fur as I actively heard it to take a oath , never had said much more than good morning to the other two  --  that gal that likely not even knowed but did n't even care that she had inherited her maw 's fatality to draw four men anyhow to that web , that one strangling hair ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , her father , the man that was still trying to lay down his life for her maw if he could jest find somebody that wanted it , and what you might call a by-standing family friend  --  to be the supporting cast while she said " I do " outen the middle of a matrimonial productionline at the City Hall before getting on a ship to go to Europe to do whatever it was she figgered she was going to do in that war . So I was the one that said , " This is Lawyer Stevens , Hoake , " with three waiters now ( he was evidently that rich ) bustling around helping us set down . " What 's yours ? " he says to Lawyer . " I know what V.K. wants .  --  Bushmill 's , " he says to the waiter . " Bring the bottle .  --  You 'll think you 're back home , " he says to me . " It tastes jest like that stuff Calvin Bookwright used to make  --  do you remember ? " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Allanovna , is n't it ? " he says . " You 've branched out a little since Frenchman 's Bend too , have n't you ? " Now he was looking at Lawyer . He taken his whole drink at one swallow though the waiter was already there with the bottle before he could a signalled . " Do n't worry , " he says . " You 've got my word . I 'm going to keep it . " " You stop worrying too , " I says . " Lawyer 's already gotp171Linda . She 's going to believe him first , no matter what anybody else might forget and try to tell her . " And we could have et dinner there too , but Lawyer says , " This is New York . We can eat dinner in Uncle Cal Bookwright'sspringhouse back home . " So we went to that dining room . Then it was time . We went to the City Hall in a taxicab . While we was getting out , the other taxicab come up and they got out . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a football player . No : like a prize fighter . He did n't look jest tough , and ruthless ai nt the word neither . He looked like he would beat you or maybe you would beat him but you probably would n't , or he might kill you or you might kill him though you probably would n't . But he would n't never dicker with you , looking at you with eyes that was pale like Hub Hampton 's but they was n't hard : jest looking at you without no hurry and completely , missing nothing , and with already a pretty good idea beforehand of what he was going to see . We went inside . It was a long hall , a corridor , a line of folks two and two that they would a been the last one in it except it was a line that never had no last : jest a next to the last and not that long : on to a door that said REGISTRAR and inside . That was n't long neither ; the two taxicabs was still waiting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The door give right off the street but with a little shirttail of ground behind it you could a called a yard though maybe city folks called it a garden ; it even had one tree in it , with three things on it that undoubtedly back in the spring or summer was leaves . But inside it was nice : full of folks of course , with two waitersdodging in and out with trays of glasses of champagne and three or four of the company helping too , not to mention the folks that was taking over the apartment while Linda and her new husband was off at the war in Spain  --  a young couple about the same age as them . " Is he a sculptor too ? " I says to Lawyer . " No , " Lawyer says . " He 's a newspaperman . " " Oh , " I says . " Then likely they been married all the time . " It was nice : a room with plenty of window lights . It hadp172a heap of stuff in it too but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of books and a piano and I knowed they was pictures because they was hanging on the wall and I knowed that some of the other things was sculpture but the rest of them I did n't know what they was , made outen pieces of wood or iron or strips of tin and wires . Except that I could n't ask then because of the rest of the poets and painters and sculptorsand musicians , since he would still have to be the host until we  --  him and Linda and Lawyer and I-Ioake and me  --  could slip out and go down to where the ship was ; evidently a heap of folks found dreams in Grinnich Village but evidentlyit was a occasion when somebody married in it . And one of them was n't even a poet or painter or sculptor or musician or even jest a ordinary moral newspaperman but evidently a haberdasher taking Saturday evening off . Becausewe was barely in the room before he was not only looking at it too but rubbing it between his thumb and finger . " Allanovna , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oklahoma ? " he says . " Oil ? " " Sir ? " I says . " Oh , " he says . " Texas . Cattle then . In Texas you can choose your million between oil and cattle , right ? " " No sir , " I says , " Missippi . I sell sewing machines . " So it was a while before Kohl finally come to me to fill my glass again . " I understand you grew up with Linda 's mother , " he says . " That 's right , " I says . " Did you make these ? " " These what ? " he says . " In this room , " I says . " Oh , " he says . " Do you want to see more of them ? Why ? " " I do n't know yet , " I says . " Does that matter ? " So weshoved on through the folks  --  it had begun to take shovingby now  --  into a hall and then up some stairs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole side of the roof jestwindow lights  --  a room not jest where folks used but wheresomebody come off by his-self and worked . And him jestp173standing a little behind me , outen the way , giving me time and room both to look . Until at last he says , " Shocked ? Mad ? " Until I says , " Do I have to be shocked and mad at something jest because I never seen it before ? " " At your age , yes , " he says . " Only children can stand surprisefor the pleasure of surprise . Grown people cant bear surprise unless they are promised in advance they will want to own it . " " Maybe I ai nt had enough time yet , " I says . " Take it then , " he says . So he leaned against the wall with his arms folded like a football player , with the noise of the party where he was still supposed to be host at coming up the stairs from below , while I taken my time to look : at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe if I had time enough I would , and some I knowed I would n't never quite recognise , until all of a sudden I knowed that would n't matter neither , not jest to him but to me too . Because anybody can see and hear and smell and feel and taste what he expected to hear and see and feel and smell and taste , and wont nothing much notice your presence nor miss your lack . So maybe when you can see and feel and smell and hear and taste what you never expected to and had n't never even imagined until that moment , maybe that 's why Old Moster picked you out to be the one of the ones to be alive . So now it was time for that-ere date . I mean the one that Lawyer and Hoake had fixed up , with Hoake saying , " But what can I tell her  --  her husband  --  her friends ? " and Lawyer says , " Why do you need to tell anybody anything ? I 've attended to all that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just take her by the arm and clear out . Just do nt forget to be aboard the ship by eleven-thirty . " Except Hoake still tried , the two of them standing in the door ready to leave , Hoake in that-ere dark expensive city suit and his derby hat in his hand , and Linda in a kind of a party dress inside herp174coat . And it was n't that they looked alike , because they did n't . She was tall for a woman , so tall she did n't have much shape ( I mean , the kind that folks whistle at ) , and he was n't tall for a man and in fact kind of stocky . But their eyes was exactly alike . Anyhow , it seemed to me that anybody that seen them could n't help but know they was kin . So he still had to try it : " A old friend of her mother 's family . Her grandfather and my father may have been distantly related  --  " and Lawyer saying , " All right , all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Hoake saying , " Yes yes , we 'll be at Twenty-One for dinner and afterwardat the Stork Club if you need to telephone . " Then they was gone and the rest of the company went too except three other men that I found out was newspapermen too , foreign correspondents ; and Kohl his-self helped his new tenant 's wife cook the spaghetti and we et it and drunk some more wine , red this time , and they talked about the war , about Spain and Ethiopia and how this was the beginning : the lights was going off all over Europe soon and maybe in this country too ; until it was time to go to the ship . And more champagne in the bedroom there , except that Lawyer had n't hardly got the first bottle open when Linda and Hoake come in . " Already ? " Lawyer says . " We did n't expect you for at least a hour yet . " " She  --  we decided to skip the Stork Club , " Hoake says . " We took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , that had n't even put the derby hat down . " Stay and have some champagne , " Lawyer says , and Kohl said something too . But Linda had done already held out her hand . " Good-bye , Mr McCarron , " she says . " Thank you for the evening and for coming to my wedding . " " Cant you say Hoake ' yet ? " he says . " Good-bye , Hoake , " she says.  | " Wait in the cab then , " Lawyer says . " We 'll join you in a minute . " " No , " Hoake says . " I 'll take another cab and leave that one for you . " Then he was gone . She shut the door behind him and came toward Lawyer , taking something outen her pocket . " Here , " she says . It was a gold cigarette lighter . " I know you wont ever use it , since you say you think you can taste the fluid when you light your pipe . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know I can taste it . " " All right , " she says . " Take it anyway . " So Lawyer taken it . " It 's engraved with your initials : see ? " " G L S , " Lawyer says . " They are not my initials . I just have two : G S. " " I know . But the man said a monogram should have three so I loaned you one of mine . " Then she stood there facing him , as tall as him almost , looking at him . " That was my father , " she says . " No , " Lawyer says . " Yes , " she says . " You do nt mean to tell me he told you that , " Lawyer says . " You know he did n't . You made him swear not to . " " No , " Lawyer says . " You swear then . " " All right , " Lawyer says . " I swear . " " I love you , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me , " Lawyer says . " It 's because every time you lie to me I can always know you will stick to it . " Then the second sentimental pilgrimage . No , something else come first . It was the next afternoon . " Now we 'll go pick up the necktie , " Lawyer says . " No , " I says . " You mean you want to go alone ? " " That 's right , " I says . So I was alone , the same little officep176again and her still in the same dress that would n't fitted nobodyalready looking at my empty collar even before I put the necktie and the hundred and fifty dollars on the desk by the new one that I had n't even teched yet because I was afraid to . It was red jest a little under what you see in a black-gum leaf in the fall , with not no single sunflower nor even a bunch of them but little yellow sunflowers all over it in a kind of diamond pattern , each one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets to after a while . I did n't dare touch it . " I 'm sorry , " I says . " But you see I jest cant . I sells sewing machines in Missippi . I cant have it knowed back there that I paid seventy-five dollars apiece for neckties . But if I 'm in the Missippi sewing-machine business and cant wear seventy-five dollar neckties , so are you in the New York necktie business and cant afford to have folks wear or order neckties and not pay for them . So here , " I says . " And I ask your kindness to excuse me . " But she never even looked at the money . " Why did he call you Vladimir Kyrilytch ? " she says . I told her . " Except we live in Missippi now , and we got to live it down . Here , " I says . " And I ask you again to ex  --  " " Take that off my desk , " she says . " I have given the ties to you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see I cant do that neither ? " I says . " No more than I could let anybody back in Missippi order a sewing machine from me and then say he had done changed his mind when I delivered it to him ? " " So , " she says . " You can not accept the ties , and I can not accept the money . Good . We do this  --  " There was a thing on the desk that looked like a cream pitcher until she snapped it open and it was a cigarette lighter . " We burn it then , half for you , half for me  --  " until I says , " Wait ! Wait ! " and she stopped . " No , " I says , " no . Not burn money , " and she says , " Why not ? " and us looking at each other , her hand holding the lit lighter and both our hands on the money . " Because it 's money , " I says . " Somebody somewhere atp177some time went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much hurt and grief somewhere to somebody that jest the money was n't never worth  --  I mean , that ai nt what I mean . . . " and she says , " I know exactly what you mean . Only the gauche , the illiterate , the frightened and the pastless destroy money . You will keep it then . You will take it back to  --  how you say ? " " Missippi , " I says . " Missippi . Where is one who , not needs : who cares about so base as needs ? Who wants something that costs one hundred fifty dollar  --  a hat , a picture , a book , a jewel for the ear ; something never never never anyhow just to eat  --  but believes he  --  she -- will never have it , has even long ago given up , not the dream but the hope  --  This time do you know what I mean ? " " I know exactly what you mean because you jest said it , " I says . " Then kiss me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Saratoga . " Did you tell Hoake better than to try to give her a lot of money , or did he jest have that better sense his-self ? " I says . " Yes , " Lawyer says . " Yes which ? " I says . " Maybe both , " Lawyer says . And in the afternoon we watched the horses , and the next morning we went out to Bemis 's Heights and Freeman 's Farm . Except that naturally there was n't no monument to one mercenary Hessian soldier that maybe could n't even speak German , let alone American , and naturally there was n't no hill or ditch or stump or rock that spoke up and said aloud : On this spot your first ancestralV.K. progenitor forswore Europe forever and entered the United States . And two days later we was back home , covering in two days the distance it taken that first V.K. four generations to do ; and now we watched the lights go out in Spain and Ethiopia , the darkness that was going top178creep eastward across all Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall across the Pacific islands until it reached even America . But that was a little while away yet when Lawyer says , " Come up to the office , " and then he says , " Barton Kohl is dead . The airplane  --  it was a worn-out civilian passenger carrier , armed with 1918 infantry machine guns , with homemadebomb bays through which the amateur crew dumped by hand the homemade bombs ; that 's what they fought Hitler 's Luftwaffe with  --  was shot down in flames so she probably could n't have identified him even if she could have reached the crash . She does n't say what she intends to do now . " " She 'll come back here , " I says . " Here ? " he says . " Back here ? " then he says , " Why the hell should n't she ? It 's home . " " That 's right , " I says . " It 's doom . " " What ? " he says . " What did you say ? " " Nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so too . "  |p179Linda  Kohl ( Snopes that was , as Thackeray would say . Kohl that was too , since he was dead ) was n't the first wounded war hero to finally straggle back to Jefferson . She was just the first one my uncle bothered to meet at the station . I do nt mean the railroad station ; by 1937 it had been a year or so since a train had passed through Jefferson that a paid passenger could have got off of . And not even the bus depot because I do nt even mean Jefferson . It was the Memphis airport we went to meet her , my uncle apparently discovering at the last minute that morning that he was not able to make an eighty-mile trip and back alone in his car . She was not even the first female hero . For two weeks back in 1919 we had had a nurse , an authentic female lieutenant  --  nota denizen , citizen of Jefferson to be sure but at least kin to ( or maybe just interested in a member of ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a base hospital in France and  --  so she said  --  had actually spent two days at a casualty clearing station within sound of the guns behind Montdidier . In fact , by 1919 even the five-year-old Jeffersonians like I was then were even a little blase about war heroes , not only unscratched ones but wounded too getting off trains from Memphis Junction or New Orleans . Not that I mean that even the unscratched ones actually called themselves heroes or thought they were or in fact thought one way or the other about it until they got home and found the epithet being dinned at them from all directions until finally some of them , a few of them , began to believe that perhaps they were . I mean , dinned at them by the ones who organised and correlated the dinning  --  the ones who had n't gone to that war and so were already on hand in advance to organisethe big debarkation-port parades and the smaller county-seat local ones , with inbuilt barbecue and beer ; the ones that had n't gone to that one and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after that either , as long as all they had to do to stay out was buy the tax-free bonds and organisethe hero-dinning parades so that the next crop of eight- and nine- and ten-year-old males could see the divisionalshoulder patches and the wound- and service-stripes and the medal ribbons . Until some of them anyway would begin to believe that that many voices dinning it at them must be right , and they were heroes . Because , according to Uncle Gavin , who had been a soldier too in his fashion ( in the American Field Service with the French army in ' 16 and ' 17 until we got into it , then still in France as a Y.M.C.A. secretary or whatever they were called ) , they had nothing else left : young men or even boys most of whom had only the vaguest or completely erroneous idea of where and what Europe was , and none at all about armies , let alone about war , snatched up by lot overnight and regimented into an expeditionary force , to survive ( if they could ) before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time to be the biggest experience of their lives . Then to be spewed , again willy-nilly and again overnight , back into what they believed would be the familiar world they had been told they were enduring disruption and risking injury and death so that it would still be there when they came back , only to find that it was n't there any more . So that the bands and the parades and the barbecues and all the rest of the hero-dinning not only would happen only that once and was already fading even before they could get adjusted to it , it was already on the way out before the belated last of them even got back home , already saying to them above the cold congealing meat and the fiat beer while the last impatient brazen chord died away : " All right , little boys ; eat your beef and potato salad and drink your beer and get out of our way , who are already up to our necks in this new world whose single and principal industry is not just solvent but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had to believe they werep181heroes even though they could n't remember now exactly at what point or by what action they had reached , entered for a moment or a second , that heroic state . Because otherwise they had nothing left : with only a third of life over , to know now that they had already experienced their greatest experience , and now to find that the world for which they had so endured and risked was in their absence so altered out of recognition by the ones who had stayed safe at home as to have no place for them in it any more . So they had to believe that at least some little of it had been true . Which ( according to Gavin ) was the why of the veterans ' clubs and legions : the one sanctuary where at least once a week they could find refuge among the other betrayed and dispossessed reaffirming to each other that at least that one infinitesimal scrap had been so . In fact ( in Jefferson anyway ) even the ones that came back with an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were when they left : merely underlined , italicised . There was Tug Nightingale . His father was the cobbler , with a little cubbyhole of a shop around a corner off the Square  --  a little scrawny man who would n't have weighed a hundredpounds with his last and bench and all his tools in his lap , with a fierce moustache which hid most of his chin too , and fierce undefeated intolerant eyes  --  a Hard-Shell Baptist who did n't merely have to believe it , because he knew it was so : that the earth was flat and that Lee had betrayed the whole South when he surrendered at Appomattox . He was a widower . Tug was his only surviving child . Tug had got almost as far as the fourth grade when the principal himself told Mr Nightingale it would be better for Tug to quit . Which Tug did , and now he could spend all his time hangingaround the auction lot behind Dilazuck 's livery stable , where he had been spending all his spare time anyhow , and where he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hait , our local horse and mule trader , then with Pat Stamperhimself , who in the horse and mule circles not just in Yoknapatawpha County or north Mississippi but over mostp182of Alabama and Tennessee and Arkansas too , was to Lonzo Hait what Fritz Kreisler would be to the fiddle player at a country picnic , and so recognised genius when he saw it . Because Tug did n't have any piddling mere affinity for and rapport with mules : he was an homme fatal to them , any mule , horse or mare either , being putty in his hands ; he could do anything with them except buy and sell them for a profit . Which is why he never rose higher than a simple hostler and handy man and so finally had to become a house painter also to make a living : not a first-rate one , but at least he could stir the paint and put it on a wall or fence after somebody had shown him where to stop . Which was his condition up to about 1916 , when he was about thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Or maybe it had already happened and we  --  Jefferson  --  only noticed it then . Up to now he had been what you might call a standard-type provincial countyseathouse painter : a bachelor , living with his father in a little house on the edge of town , having his weekly bath in the barbershop on Saturday night and then getting a little drunk afterward  --  not too much so : only once every two or three years waking up Sunday morning in the jail until they would release him on his own recognizance ; this not for being too drunk but for fighting , though the fighting did stem from the whiskey , out of that mutual stage of it when the inevitable one ( never the same one : it did n't need to be ) challenged his old fixed father-bequeathed convictions that General Lee had been a coward and a traitor and that the earth was a flat plane with edges like the shed roofs he painted  --  then shooting a little dice in the big ditch behind the cemetery while he sobered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; with maybe four trips a year to the Memphis brothels . Then it happened to him . He still had the Saturday-night barbershop bath and he still drank a little , though as far as Jefferson knew , never enough any more to need to go to combat over General Lee and Ptolemy and Isaac Newton ,  |p183so  that not only the jail but the harassed night marshal too who at the mildest would bang on the locked barbershop or poolroom door at two oclock Sunday morning , saying , " If you boys do nt quiet down and go home , " knew him no more . Nor did the dice game in the cemetery ditch ; on Sundaymorning now he would be seen walking with his scrawny fiercely moustached miniature father toward the little backstreetHard-Shell church , and that afternoon sitting on the minute gallery of their doll-sized house poring ( whom the first three grades of school rotationally licked and the fourth one completely routed ) over the newspapers and magazines which brought us all we knew about the war in Europe . He had changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) did n't know how much until the next April , 1917 , after the Lusitania and the President 's declaration , and Captain ( Mister then until he was elected captain of it ) McLendon organised the Jefferson company to be known as the Sartoris Rifles in honor of the original Colonel Sartoris ( there would be no Sartoris in it since Bayard and his twin brother John were already in England training for the Royal Flying Corps ) , and then we heard the rest of it : how Tug Nightingale , past thirty now and so even when the draft came would probably escape it , was one of the first to apply , and we  --  they  --  found out what his dilemma was : which was simply that he did not dare let his father find out that he planned to join the Yankee army , since if his father ever learned it , he , Tug , would be disinherited and thrown out . So it was more than Captain McLendon who said , " What ? What 's that ? " and McLendon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergeant  --  went home with Tug and the sergeant-to-be told it : " It was like being shut up in a closet with a buzz saw that had jumped off the axle at top speed , or say a bundle of dynamite with the fuse lit and snapping around the floor like a snake , that you not only cant get close enough to step on it , you do nt want to : all you want is out , and Mack saying , Wait , Mr Nightingale , it ai nt the Yankee army : it 's thep184army of the United States : your own country , ' and that durn little maniac shaking and seething until his moustache looked like it was on fire too , hollering , Shoot the sons of bitches ! Shoot em ! Shoot em ! ' and then Tug himself trying it : Papa , papa , Captain McLendon and Crack here both belong to it , ' and old man Nightingale yelling , Shoot them then . Shoot all the blue-bellied sons of bitches , ' and Tug still trying , saying , Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they pass that draft they will come and get me anyway , ' and still that little maniac hollering , Shoot you all ! Shoot all you sons of bitches ! ' Yes sir . Likely Tug could join the German army or maybe even the French or British , and had his blessing . But not the one that General Lee betrayed him to that day back in 1865 . So he threw Tug out . The three of us got out of that house as fast as we could , but before we even reached the sidewalk he was already in the room that was evidently Tug 's . He never even waited to open the door : just kicked the window out , screen and all , and started throwing Tug 's clothes out into the yard . " So Tug had crossed his Rubicon , and should have been safe now . I mean , Captain McLendon took him in . He  --  McLendon  --  was one of a big family of brothers in a big house with a tremendous mother weighing close to two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more would n't matter ; maybe she never even noticed Tug . So he should have been safe now while the company waited for orders to move . But the others would n't let him alone ; his method of joining the colors was a little too unique , not to mention East Lynne ; there was always one to say : " Tug , is it really so that General Lee did n't need to give up when he did ? " and Tug would say , " That 's what papa says . He was there and seen it , even if he was n't but seventeen years old . " And the other would say : " So you had to go clean against him , clean against your own father , to join the Rifles ? " And Tug sitting there quite still now , the hands that never would be able to paint morep185than the roughest outhouse walls and finesseless fences but which could do things to the intractable and unpredictable mule which few other hands dared , hanging quiet too between his knees , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the other  --  and all the rest of them within range  --  watching Tug with just half an eye since the other three halves would be watching Captain McLendon across the room ; in fact they usually waited until McLendonhad left , was actually out . " That 's right , " Tug would say ; then the other : " Why did you do it , Tug ? You 're past thirty now , safe from the draft , and your father 's an old man alone here with nobody to take care of him . " " We cant let them Germans keep on treating folks like they 're doing . Somebody 's got to make them quit . " " So you had to go clean against your father to join the army to make them quit . And now you 'll have to go clean against him again to go round to the other side of the world where you can get at them . " " I 'm going to France , " Tug would say . " That 's what I said : halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west ? You can pick either one and still get there . Or better still , and I 'll make you a bet . Pick out east , go on east until you find the war , do whatever you aim to do to them Germans and then keep right on going east , and I 'll bet you a hundred dollars to one that when you see Jefferson next time , you 'll be looking at it right square across Miss Joanna Burden 's mailbox one mile west of the courthouse . " But by that time Captain McLendon would be there ; probably somebody had gone to fetch him . He may have been such a bad company commander that he was relievedof his command long before it ever saw the lines , and a few years after this he was going to be the leader in somethinghere in Jefferson that I anyway am glad I do nt have to lie down with in the dark every time I try to go to sleep . But at least he held his company together ( and not by the bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had ,  |p186he  would n't have had a man left by the first Saturday night , but by simple instinctive humanity , of which even he , even in the middle of that business he was going to be mixed up in later , seemed to have had a little , like now ) until a better captain could get hold of it . He was already in uniform . He was a cotton man , a buyer for one of the Memphis export houses , and he spent most of his commissions gambling on cotton futures in the market , but he never had looked like a farmer until he put on the uniform . " What the hell 's going on here ? " he said . " What the hell do you think Tug is ? a damn ant running around a damn orange or something ? He ai nt going around anything : he 's going straight across it , across the water to France to fight for his country , and when they do nt need him in France any longer he 's coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way he went out of it , like we 'll all be damn glad to get back to it . So do nt let me hear any more of this " ( excrement : my word ) " any more . " Whether or not Tug would continue to need Captain McLendon , he did n't have him much longer . The company was mustered that week and sent to Texas for training ; whereupon , since Tug was competent to paint any fiat surfaceprovided it was simple enough , with edges and not theoretical boundaries , and possessed that gift with horses and mules which the expert Pat Stamper had recognised at once to partake of that inexplicable quality called genius , naturally the army made him a cook and detached him the same day , so that he was not only the first Yoknapatawpha County soldier ( the Sartoris boys did n't count since they were officially British troops ) to go overseas , he was among the last of all American troops to get back home , which was in late 1919 , since obviously the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mislay where it had sent him ( not lose him ; my own experience between ' 42 and ' 45 taught me that the military never loses anything : it merely buries it ) . So now he was back home again , living alone now ( oldp187Mr Nightingale had died in that same summer of 1917 , killed , Uncle Gavin said , by simple inflexibility , having set his intractable and contemptuous face against the juggernautof history and science both that April day in 1865 and never flinched since ) , a barn and fence painter once more , with his Saturday-night bath in the barbershop and again drinking and gambling again within his means , only with on his face now a look , as V. K. Ratliff put it , as if he had been taught and believed all his life that the fourth dimension was invisible , then suddenly had seen one . And he did n't have Captain McLendon now . I mean , McLendon was back home too but they were no longer commander and man . Or maybe it was that even that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have had a pretty good supply since none of it seemed to be within his reach on his next humanitarian crises after that one when he shielded Tug from the harsh facts of cosmology , would not have sufficed here . This happened in the barbershop too ( no , I was n't there ; I still was n't old enough to be tolerated in the barbershop at ten oclock on Saturday night even if I could have got away from Mother ; this was hearsay from Ratliff to Uncle Gavin to me ) . This time the straight man was Skeets McGowan , Uncle Willy Christian 's soda jerker  --  a young man with a swagger and dash to him , who probably smelled more like toilet water than just water , with a considerable followingof fourteen- and fifteen-year-old girls at Uncle Willy 's fountain , who we realised afterward had been just a little older than we always thought and , as Ratliff said , even ten years later would never know as much as he  --  Skeetsfiguredhe had already forgotten ten years ago ; he had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath and was sitting quietly enough while the first drink or two began to take hold . " So when you left Texas , you went north , " Skeets said . " That 's right , " Tug said . " Come on , " Skeets said . " Tell us about it . You left Texasp188going due north , to New York . Then you got on the boat , and it kept right on due north too . " " That 's right , " Tug said . " But suppose they fooled you a little . Suppose they turned the boat , to the east or west or maybe right back south  --  " " God damn it , " Tug said . " Do nt you think I know where north is ? You can wake me up in the bed in the middle of the night and I can point my hand due north without even turning on the light . " " What 'll you bet ? Five dollars ? Ten ? " " I 'll bet you ten dollars to one dollar except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shampoo or that silk shirt . " " All right , all right , " Skeets said . " So the boat went straight north , to France . And you stayed in France two years and then got on another boat and it went straight north too . Then you got off that boat and got on a train and it  --  " " Shut up , " Tug said. "  --  went straight north too . And when you got off , you were back in Jefferson . " " Shut up , you goddam little bastard , " Tug said . " So do nt you see what that means ? Either one of two things : either they moved Jefferson  --  " Now Tug was on his feet though even now apparently Skeets knew no better : "  --  which all the folks that stayed around here and did n't go to that war can tell you they did n't . Or you left Jefferson going due north by way of Texas and come back to Jefferson still going due north without even passing Texas again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loafers too and finally the night marshal himself to immobilise Tug . Though by that time Skeets was already in the ambulance on his way to the hospital . And there was Bayard Sartoris . He got back in the spring of ' 19 and bought the fastest car he could find and spent his time ripping around the county or back and forth top189Memphis until ( so we all believed ) his aunt , Mrs Du Pre , looked over Jefferson and picked out Narcissa Benbow and then caught Bayard between trips with the other hand long enough to get them married , hoping that would save Bayard 's neck since he was now the last Sartoris Mohican ( John had finally got himself shot down in July of ' 18 ) , only it did n't seem to work . I mean , as soon as he got Narcissapregnant , which must have been pretty quick , he was back in the car again until this time Colonel Sartoris himselfstepped into the breach , who hated cars yet gave up his carriage and pair to let Bayard drive him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow the car down during that much of the elapsed mileage . Except that Colonel Sartoris had a heart condition , so when the wreck came it was him that died : Bayard just walked out of the crash and disappeared , abandoned pregnant wife and all , until the next spring when he was still trying to relieve his boredom by seeing how much faster he could make something travel than he could invent a destination for ; this time another aeroplane : a new experimental type at the Dayton testing field : only this one fooled him by shedding all four of its wings in midair . " That 's right : boredom , Uncle Gavin said  --  that war was the only civilised condition which offered any scope for the natural blackguardism inherent in men , that not just condonedand sanctioned it but rewarded it , and that Bayard was simply bored : he would never forgive the Germans not for starting the war but for stopping it , ending it . But Mother said that was wrong . She said that Bayard was frightened and ashamed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to be capable of , vulnerable to being ashamed . She said that Sartorises were different from other people . That most people , nearly all people , loved themselves first , only they knew it secretly and maybe even admitted it secretly ; and so they did n't have to be ashamed of it  --  or if they were ashamed , they did n't need to be afraid of being ashamed . But that Sartorisesp190did n't even know they loved themselves first , except Bayard . Which was all right with him and he was n't ashamed of it until he and his twin brother reached England and got into flight training without parachutes in aeroplanes made out of glue and baling wire ; or maybe not even until they were at the front , where even for the ones that had lived that far the odds were near zero against scout pilots survivingthe first three weeks of active service . When suddenlyBayard realised that , unique in the squadron and , for all he knew , unique in all the R.F.C. or maybe all military air forces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was two of him since he had a twin engaged in the same risk and chance . And so in effect he alone out of all the people flying in that war had been vouchsafed a double indemnity against those odds ( and vice versa of course since his twin would enjoy the identical obverse vouchsafement )  --  and in the next second , with a kind of terror , discovered that he was ashamed of the idea , knowledge , of being capable of having thought it even . That was what Mother said his trouble was  --  why he apparently came back to Jefferson for the sole purpose of trying , in that sullen and pleasureless manner , to find out just how many different ways he could risk breaking his neck that would keep the most people anguished or upset or at least annoyed : that completely un-Sartoris-like capacity for shame which he could neither live with nor quit ; could neither live in toleration with it nor by his own act repudiate it . That was why the risking , the chancing , the fatalism . Obviously the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have occurred to the other twin at the same moment , since they were twins . But it probably had n't worried John any more than the things he had done in his war ( Uncle Gavin said  --  and in about five years I was going to have a chance to test it myself  --  thatno man ever went to a war , even in the Y.M.C.A. , without bringing back something he wished he had n't done or anyway would stop thinking about ) worried that oldp191original Colonel Sartoris who had been their great-grandfather ; only he , Bayard , of all his line was that weak , that un-Sartoris . So now ( if Mother was right ) he had a double burden . One was anguish over what base depths of imagination and selfish hope he knew himself to be , not so much capable of as doomed to be ashamed of ; the other , the fact that if that twinship double indemnity did work in his favor and John was shot down first , he  --  Bayard  --  would , no matter how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the omniscience of the mutual immortality , with the foul stain of his weakness now beyond concealment . The foul stain being not the idea , because the same idea must have occurred to his twin at the same instant with himself althoughthey were in different squadrons now , but that of the two of them , John would not have been ashamed of it . The idea being simply this : John had managed to shoot down three hues before he himself was killed ( he was probably a better shot than Bayard or maybe his flight commanderliked him and set up targets ) and Bayard himself had racked up enough ninths and sixteenths , after the Britishmethod of scoring ( unless somebody was incredible enough to say " Not me ; I was too damn scared to remember to pull up the cocking handles " ) to add up to two and maybe an inch over ; now that John was gone and no longer needed his , suppose , just suppose he could wangle , bribe , forge , corrupt the records and whoever kept them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that one of them anyway could come back home an ace  --  an idea not base in itself , because John had not only thought of it too but if he had lived and Bayard had died , would have managed somehow to accomplish it , but base only after he , Bayard , had debased and befouled it by being ashamed of it . And he could not quit it of his own volition , since when he faced John 's ghost some day in the course of simple fatality , John would be just amused and contemptuous ; where if he did it by putting the pistol barrel in his mouthp192himself , that ghost would be not just risible and contemptuousbut forever unreconciled , irreconcilable . But Linda Snopes  --  excuse me : Snopes Kohl  --  would be our first female one . So you would think the whole town would turn out , or at least be represented by delegates : from the civic clubs and churches , not to mention the AmericanLegion and the V.F.W. , which would have happened if she had been elected Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or land mine or whatever it was that went off in or under the ambulance she was driving and left her stone deaf . So I said , " What does she want to come back home for ? There 's nothing for her to join . What would she want in a Ladies ' Auxiliary , raffling off homemadejam and lamp shades . Even if she could make jam , since obviously cooking is the last thing a sculptor would demand of his girl . Who was just passing time anyway betweenCommunist meetings until somebody started a Fascist war he could get into . Not to mention the un-kosher stuff she would have had to learn in Jefferson , Mississippi . Especiallyif where she learned to cook was in that Dirty Spoon her papa beat Ratliff out of back there when they first came to town . " But I was wrong . It would n't be municipal : only private : just three people only incidentally from Jefferson because they were mainly out of her mother 's past : my uncle , her father , and Ratliff . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even get in the car . " Come on , " Uncle Gavin said . " Go with us . " " I 'll wait here , " Ratliff said . " I 'll be the local committee . Until next time , " he said at me . " What ? " Uncle Gavin said . " Nothing , " Ratliff said . " Jest a joke Chick told me that I 'm reminding him of . " Then I saw it was n't going to be even two out of her mother 's past . We were not even going by the bank , let alone stop at it . I said , " What the hell would Mr Snopes want , throwing away at least six hours of good usury to make a trip all the way to Memphis to meet his daughter ,  |p193after  all the expense he had to go to get her out of Jefferson  --  notonly butchering up De Spain 's house , but all that imported Italian marble over her mother 's grave to give her something worth going away from or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said : " So it 's my fault I was n't born soon enough either to defend Das Democracy in your war or Das Kapital in hers . Meaning there 's still plenty of time for me yet . Or maybe what you mean is that Hitler and Mussolini and Franco all three working together can not get an authentic unimpeachable paid-up member of the Harvard R.O.T.C. into really serious military trouble . Because I probably wont make Porcellian either ; F.D.R. did n't . " I said : " That 's it . That 's why you insisted on me coming along this morning : although she has n't got any eardrums now and cant hear you say No or Please No or even For God 's sake No , at least she cant marry you before we get back to Jefferson with me right here in the car too . But there 's the rest of the afternoon when you can chase me out , not to mention the eight hours of the night when Mother likes to believe I am upstairs asleep . Not to mentionI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you believe your . . . is it virginity or just celibacy ? is worth even that sacrifice ? But then why not , since it was your idea to send me all the way to Cambridge , Mass , for what we laughingly call an education . Being as Mother says she 's been in love with you all her life , only she was too young to know it and you were too much of a gentleman to tell her . Or does Mother really always know best ? " By this time we had reached the airport ; I mean Memphis . Uncle Gavin said , " Park the car and let 's have some coffee . We 've probably got at least a half-hour yet . " We had the coffee in the restaurant ; I do nt know why they do nt call it the Skyroom here too . Maybe Memphis is still off quota . Ratliff said she would have to marry somebody sooner or later , and every day that passed made it that much sooner . No , that was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  could n't escape forever , that almost any day now some woman would decide he was mature and dependableenough at last for steady work in place of merely an occasional chore ; and that the sooner this happened the better , since only then would he be safe . I said , " How safe ? He seems to me to be doing all right ; I never knew anybodythat scatheless . " " I do nt mean him , " Ratliff said . " I mean us , YoknapatawphaCounty ; that he would maybe be safe to live with then because he would n't have so much time for meddling . " In which case , saving us would take some doing . Becausehe  --  Gavin  --  had one defect in his own character which always saved him , no matter what jeopardy it left the rest of us in . I mean , the fact that people get older , especiallyyoung girls of fifteen or sixteen , who seem to get older all of a sudden in six months or one year than they or anybodyelse ever does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked out children , or maybe he was just vulnerable to female children and they chose him , whichever way you want it . That the selecting or victim-falling was done at an age when the oath of eternal fidelity would have ceased to exist almost before the breath was dry on it . I 'm thinking now of Melisandre Backus naturally , before my time and Linda Snopes 's too . That is , Melisandre was twelve and thirteen and fourteen several years before she vacated for Linda to take her turn in the vacuum , Gavin selecting and ordering the books of poetry to read to Melisandre or anywaysupervise and check on , which was maybe how by actual test , trial and error , he knew which ones to improve Linda 's mind and character with when her turn came , or anyway alter them . Though pretty soon Melisandre committed the irrevocableerror of getting a year older and so quitting forever that fey unworld of Spenser and the youth Milton , for the human race where even the sort of girl that he picked out or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devotion to her , she was in a position to tell him eitherp195to put up or shut up . Anyway , he was saved that time . Though I was n't present to remember exactly what the sequencewas : whether Gavin went off to Harvard first or maybe it was between Harvard and Heidelberg , or whether she got married first . Anyway , when he got back from his war , she was married . To a New Orleans underworld big shot named Harriss with two esses . And how in the world or where on earth she ever managed to meet him  --  a shy girl , motherless and an only child , who lived on what used to be one of our biggest plantations two or three miles from town but that for years had been gradually going to decay , with her widowered father who spent all his time on the front gallery in summer and in the library in winter with a bottle of whiskey and a volume of Horace . Who ( Melisandre ) had as far as we knew never been away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town by a Negro coachman in a victoria while she graduated from the grammarschool then the high school then the Female Academy . And a man about whom all we knew was what he said : that his name was Harriss with two esses , which maybe it was , and that he was a New Orleans importer . Which we knew he was , since ( this was early 1919 , before Uncle Gavin got back home ) even Jefferson recognised when it saw one a bullet-proof Cadillac that needed two chauffeurs , both in double-breasted suits that bulged a little at the left armpit . Not to mention the money . Mr Backus died about then and of course there were some to say it was with a broken heart over his only child marrying a bootleg czar . Though apparently he waited long enough to make sure his son-inlawwas actually a czar or anyway the empire a going and solvent one , since the money had already begun to show a little before he died  --  the roofs and galleries patched and shored up even if Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gravel in the drive so that when she came home to spend that first Christmas , she and the nurse and the czarevitch could go back and forth to town in an automobileinstead of the old victoria drawn by a plow team.  |p196Then  Mr Backus died and the house and outbuildings too got painted . And now Harriss with both his esses began to appear in Jefferson , making friends even in time though most of Yoknapatawpha County was unsold still , just neutral , going out there in the Model T 's and on horses and mules , to stand along the road and watch what had been just a simple familiar red-ink north Mississippi cotton plantation being changed into a Virginia or Long Island horse farm , with miles of white panel fence where the rest of us were not a bit too proud for what we called bobwire and any handy sapling post , and white stables with electric light and steam heat and running water and butlers and footmen for the horses where a lot of the rest of us still depended on coal-oil lamps for light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest woodlot and spring or well . Then there were two children , an heir and a princess too , when Harriss died with his two esses in a New Orleans barber'schair of his ordinary thirty-eight-caliber occupational disease . Whereupon the horses and their grooms and valets became sold and the house closed except for a caretaker , vacant now of Mrs Harriss with her two esses and the two children and the five maids and couriers and nannies and secretaries , and now Mother and the other ones who had been girls with her in the old Academy days would get the letters and post cards from the fashionable European cities telling how just the climate at first but presently , in time , the climate and the schools both were better for the childrenand ( on Mother 's naturally ) she hoped Gavin was well and maybe even married . " So at least he 's safe from that one , " I told Ratliff , who said , " Safe ? " " Why the hell not ? She not only got too big for the fairy tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : what the hell does she want to marry anybody for ? Or not Gavin anyway ; he do nt want money : all he wants is just to meddle and change . Why the hell is n't he safe now ? "  | " That 's right , " Ratliff said . " It looks like he would almosthave to be , do nt it ? At least until next time . " Joke . And still worth repeating two hours ago when he declined to come with us . And Gavin sitting there drinking a cup of what whoever ran the airport restaurant called coffee , looking smug and inscrutable and arrogant and immune as a louse on a queen 's arse . Because maybe Linda Kohl ( pardonme , Snopes Kohl ) had plenty of money too , not only what her mother must have left her but what Uncle Gavin , as her guardian , had managed to chisel out of old Will Varner . Not chiselled out of her father too because maybe old Snopes was glad to stump up something just to have what Gavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But she did n't have two children so all Ratliff and I had to trust , depend on this time was that old primary condition founded on simple evanescence , that every time a moment occurred they would be one momentolder : that they had to be alive for him to notice them , and they had to be in motion to be alive , and the only moment of motion which caught his attention , his eye , was that one at which they entered puberty like the swirl of skirt or flow or turn of limb when entering , passing through a door , slowed down by the camera trick but still motion , still a moment , irrevocable . That was really what saved him each time : that the momenthad to be motion . They could n't stop in the door , and once through it they did n't stop either ; sometimes they did n't even pause long enough to close it behind them beforegoing on to the next one and through it , which was into matrimony  --  from maturation to parturition in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncle Gavin would n't be at that next door . He would still be watching the first one . And since life is not so much motion as an inventless repetition of motion , he would never he at that first door long before there would be another swirl , another unshaped vanishing adolescent leg . So I should have thought to tell Ratliff that , while I was in Memphis helping Unclep198Gavin say good-bye to this one , he might be looking around the Square to see who the next one was going to be , as Linda had already displaced Melisandre Backus probably before Melisandre even knew she had been dispossessed . Then in the next moment I knew that would not be necessary ; obviously Uncle Gavin had already picked her out himself , which was why he could sit there placid and composed , drinking coffee while we waited for the plane to be announced . Which it was at last . We went out to the ramp . I stopped at the rail . " I 'll wait here , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even if it 's only anonymity and not solitude . Have you got your slate ready ? or maybe she 'll already have one built in on her cuff , or maybe strapped to her leg like aviators carry maps . " But he had gone on . Then the plane taxied up , one of the new DC 3 's , and in time there she was . I could n't see her eyes from this distance but then it was n't them , it was just her ears the bomb or shell or mine or whatever it was blew up  --  the same tall girl too tall to have a shape but then I do nt know : women like that and once you get their clothes off they surprise you even if she was twenty-nine years old now . Then I could see her eyes , so dark blue that at first you thought they were black . And I for one never did know how or where she got them or the black hair either since old Snopes 's eyes were the color of stagnant pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , and her mother had had blue eyes too but her hair was blond . So that when I tried to remember her , she always looked like she had just been raided out of a brothel in the Scandinavian Valhalla and the cops had just managed to fling a few garments on her before they hustled her into the wagon . Fine eyes too , that probably if you were the one to finally get the clothes off you would have called them beautiful too . And she even had the little pad and pencil in her hand while she was kissing Gavin . I mean , kissing him . Though evidently he would need a little time to get used to using it or depend/ing on it because he said aloud , just like she was anybody else : " Here 's Chick too , " and she remembered me ; she was as tall as Gavin and damn near as tall as me , as well as a nail-biter though maybe that had come after the shell or perhaps after the bereavement . And when she shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tires on it too , speaking not loud but in that dry harsh quacking voice that deaf people learn to use , even asking about Mother and Father as if she really cared , like any ordinary Jefferson woman that never dreamed of going to wars and getting blown up . Though Uncle Gavin rememberednow , or at least was learning fast , taking the pad and pencil and scrawling something on it , baggage I reckon , since she said , " Oh yes , " just like she could hear too , and got the checks out of her handbag . I brought the car up while they untangled the bags . So she had lived with the guy for years before they married but it did n't show on her . And she had gone to Spain to the war and got blown up at the front , and that did n't show on her either . I said , " Why do nt you let her drive ? Then maybe she wont be so nervous because she cant talk to you . " " Maybe you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did , and brought the hero home , the two of them in the back . And somebody may have said , " Why do nt we all ride in front ? the seat 's wide enough . " Though I do nt remember it . Or at least nobody did . Or anyway at least they got into the back seat . So I do nt remember that either : only Uncle Gavin : " You can relax now . You 're quite safe . I 'm holding her hand . " Which they were , she holding his hand in both hers on her lap and every mile or so the duck voice would say , " Gavin , " and then after a mile or so , " Gavin . " And evidentlyshe had n't had the pad and pencil long enough to get used to them either or maybe when you lose hearing and enter real silence you forget that everything does not take place in that privacy and solitude . Or maybe after hep200took the pencil from her to answer on the pad , she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had slates : " Yes it does . I can feel it , somewhere in my skull or the back of my mouth . It 's an ugly sound . Is n't it ? " But evidentlyGavin was learning because it was still the duck voice : " Yes it is . I can feel it , I tell you . " And still the duck voice : " How ? If I try to practise , how can I know when it 's right ? " Which I agree with myself : if you 're going to take time out from your law practice and being county attorneyto restore to your deaf girl friend the lost bridehead of her mellifluity , how would you go about it . Though what a chance for a husband : to teach your stone-deaf wife that all she needed to make her tone and pitch beautiful was merely to hold her breath while she spoke . Or maybe what Uncle Gavin wrote next was simply Jonson ( or some of that old Donne or Herrick maybe or even just Suckling maybe  --  any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye now  --  by that old Stevens ) Vale not these cherry lips with vacant speech But let me drink instead thy tender Yes . Or maybe what he wrote was simpler still : Hold it till we get home . This is no place to restore your voice . Besides , this infant will have to go back to Cambridge next month and then we 'll have plenty of time , plenty of privacy . Thus we brought the hero home . Now we could see Jefferson , the clock on the courthouse , not to mention her father 's water tank , and now the duck voice was saying Ratliff . " Bart liked him . He said he had n't expected to like anybody from Mississippi , but he was wrong . " What Gavin wrote this time was obvious , since the voice said : " Not even you . He made me promise  --  I mean , whichever one of us it was , would give Ratliff one of his things . You remember it  --  the Italian boy that you did n't know what it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had never even seen an Italian boy , nor anything else beyond the Confederate monument in front of the courthouse , knew at once what it was , and even what he was doing ? " And I would have liked the pad myself long enough top201write What was the Italian boy doing ? only we were home now , the hero ; Gavin said : " Stop at the bank first . He should have some warning ; simple decency commands it . Unless he has had his warning and has simply left town for a little space in which to wrestlewith his soul and so bring it to the moment which it must face . Assuming of course that even he has realised by now that he simply can not foreclose her out of existence like a mortgage or a note . " " And have a public reception here in the street before she has had a chance to fix her makeup ? " I said . " Relax , " he said again . " When you are a little older you will discover that people really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want right now to believe . " I pulled up at the bank . But if I had been her I would n't even have reached for the pencil , duck quack or not , to say , " What the hell ? Take me on home . " She did n't . She sat there , holding his hand in both hers , not just on her lap but right against her belly , looking around at the Square , the duck voice saying , " Gavin . Gavin . " Then : " There goes Uncle Willy , coming back from dinner . " Except it was n't old man Christian : he was dead . But then it did n't really matter whether anybody wrote that on the pad or not . And Gavin was right . Nobody stopped . I watched two of them recognise her . No , I mean they recognised juxtaposition : Gavin Stevens 's car at the curb before the bank at twentytwominutes past one in the afternoon with me at the wheel and Gavin and a woman in the back seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kohl , anyhow that she was female and from Jefferson and had gone near enough to a war for it to bust her eardrums . Because he is right : people are kind and gentle and considerate . It 's not that you do nt expect them to be , it 's because you have already made up your mind they are not and so they upset you , throw you off . They did n't even stop , just one of them said Howdy Gavin and went on . I got out and went into the bank . Because what would Ip202do myself if I had a daughter , an only child , and her grandfather had plenty of money for it and I could have afforded myself to let her go away to school . Only I did n't and nobodyknew why I would n't , until suddenly I let her go , but only as far as the University which was only fifty miles away ; and nobody knew why for that either : only that I aimed to become president of the bank that the president of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife ever since we moved to town . That is , nobody knew why until three months later , when my wife went to the beauty parlor for the first time in her life and that night shot herself carefully through the temple so as not to disarrangethe new permanent , and when the dust finally settledsure enough that fornicating bank president had left town and now I was not only president of his bank but living in his house and you would have thought I would n't need the daughter any more and she could go wherever the hell she wanted provided it was n't ever Jefferson , Mississippi , again . Except I would n't even let her do that until we could both sit in the car and see the monument over her mother 's grave unveiled , sitting there defenseless before the carved face and the carved defenseless taunt : A Virtuous Wife Is a Crown to Her HusbandHer Children Rise and Call Her Blessedand then I said , " All right . You can go now . " And I came back out . " Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To go home and wait there for his daughter . " So we went there , on to the colonial monstrosity which was the second taunt . He had three monuments in Jefferson now : the water tank , the gravestone , and the mansion . And who knows at which of the windows he lurked his wait or waited out his lurk , whichever way you prefer . " Maybe I should come in too , " I said . " Maybe we should each have a pad and pencil , " Unclep203Gavin said . " Then everybody could hear . " We were expected . Almost at once the Negro yardman-chauffeur came out the front door . I got the luggage out onto the sidewalk while they still stood there , she as tall as him and Gavin in her arms just as much as she was in his , kissing right on the street in the broad daylight , the duck voice saying " Gavin Gavin " not so much as if she still could n't believe it was him at last but as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convinced she made . Then she turned him loose and he said , " Come on , " and we got back in the car , and that was all . The hero was home . I turned in the middle of the block and looked not back , I would have liked to say , if it had been true : the houseman still scuttling up the walk with the bags and she still standing there , looking at us , a little too tall for my taste , immured , inviolate in silence , invulnerable , serene . That was it : silence . If there were no such thing as sound . If it only took place in silence , no evil man has invented could really harm him : explosion , treachery , the human voice . That was it : deafness . Ratliff and I could n't beat that . Those others , the other times had flicked the skirt or flowed or turned the limb at and into mere puberty ; beyond it and immediately , was the other door immediately beyond which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfillment , the end . But she had beat him . Not in motion continuous through a door , a moment , but immobilised by a thunderclapinto silence , herself the immobile one while it was the door and the walls it opened which fled away and on , herselfno mere moment 's child but the inviolate bride of silence , inviolable in maidenhead , fixed , forever safe from change and alteration . Finally I ran Ratliff to ground ; it took three days . " Her husband is sending you a present , " I said . " It 's that sculpture you liked : the Italian boy doing whatever it was you liked that Gavin himself who has not only seen Italian boys before but maybe even one doing whatever this one isp204doing , did n't even know where first base was . But it 's all right . You do nt have a female wife nor any innocent femaledaughters either . So you can probably keep it right there in the house .  --  She 's going to marry him , " I said . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can stand it . Besides , if somebody jest marries him , maybe the rest of us will be safe . " " The rest of them , you mean ? " I said . " I mean jest what I said , " Ratliff answered . " I mean the rest of all of us. "  |p205Gavin  was right . That was late August . Three weeks later I was back in Cambridge again , hoping , I mean trying , or maybe what I mean is I belonged to the class that would or anyway should , graduate next June . But I had been in Jefferson three weeks , plenty long enough even if they had insisted on having banns read : something quite unnecessaryfor a widow who was not only a widow but a wounded war hero too . So then I thought maybe they were waiting until they would be free of me . You know : the old roadcompanydrammer reversed in gender : the frantic child clinging this time to the prospective groom 's coattail , crying " Papa papa papa " ( in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us marry Mrs Smith . " Then I thought ( it was Thanksgiving now ; pretty soon I would be going home for Christmas ) Naturally it wont occur to any of them to bother to notify me way up here in Massachusetts . So I even thought of writing and asking , not Mother of course and certainly not Uncle Gavin , since if it had happened he would be too busy to answer , and if it had n't he would still be too busy either dodging for his life if he was the one still saying No , or trying to learn her enough language to hear Please if he was the one saying Yes . But to Ratliff , who would be an interested bystander even if you could n't call that much curiosity about other people 's affairs which he possessed merely innocent  --  maybe even a wire : Are they bedded formally yet or not ? I mean is it rosa yet or still just sub , assuming you assume the same assumption they teach us up here at Harvard that once you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai nt all that up-and-down at all . Then it was Christmas and I thought Maybe I wronged them . Maybe they have been waiting for me all along , not to interrupt my education by an emergency call but for the season of peace and good will to produce me available top206tote the ring or bouquet or whatever it is . But I did n't even see her . Uncle Gavin and I even spent most of one whole day together . I was going out to Sartoris to shoot quail with Benbow ( he was n't but seventeen but he was considered one of the best bird shots in the county , second only to Luther Biglin , a half farmer , half dog trainer , half market hunter , who shot left-handed , not much older than Benbow , in fact about my age , who lived up near Old Wyottsport on the river ) and Uncle Gavin invited himself along . He  --  Gavin  --  would n't be much of a gun even if he stopped talkinglong enough but now and then he would go with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that finally said : " How are the voice lessons coming ? " " Mrs Kohl ? Fair . But your fresh ear would be the best judge , " and I said : " When will that be ? " and he said : " Any time you 're close enough to hear it . " And again on Christmas day , it was me . Ratliff usually had Christmas dinner with us , Uncle Gavin 's guest though Mother liked him too , whether or not because she was Uncle Gavin 's twin . Or sometimes Uncle Gavin ate with Ratliff and then he would take me because Ratliff was a damned good cook , living alone in the cleanest little house you ever saw , doing his own housework and he even made the blue shirts he always wore . And this time too it was m . " What about Mrs Kohl for dinner too ? " I asked Mother , and Uncle Gavin said : " My God , did you come all the way down here from Cambridge to spend Christmas too looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Excuseme , Maggie , " and Mother said : " Certainly she will have to take her first Christmas dinnerat home with her father . " And the next day I left . Spoade  --  his father had been at Harvard back in 1909 with Uncle Gavin  --  had invited me to Charleston to see what a Saint Cecilia ball looked like from inside . Because we always broke up then anyway ; the day after Christmas Father al/ways went to Miami to spend a week looking at horses and Mother would go too , not that she was interested in runninghorses but on the contrary : because of her conviction that her presence or anyway adjacence or at least contiguity would keep him from buying one . Then it was 1938 and I was back in Cambridge . Then it was September , 1938 , and I was still or anyway again in Cambridge , in law school now . Munich had been observed or celebrated or consecrated , whichever it was , and Uncle Gavin said , " It wont be long now . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I said : " Then what 's the use in me wasting two or three more years becoming a lawyer when if you 're right nobody will have time for civil cases any more , even if I 'm still around to prosecute or defend them ? " and he said : " Because when this one is over , all humanity and justice will have left will be the law : " and I said : " What else is it using now ? " and he said : " These are good times , boom halcyon times when what do you want with justice when you 've already got welfare ? Now the law is the last resort , to get your hand into the pocket which so far has resisted or foiled you . " That was last spring , in June when he and Mother ( they had lost Father at Saratoga though he had promised to reach Cambridge in time for the actual vows ) came up to see me graduate in Ack . And I said , " What ? No wedding bells yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " and I said : " How are the voice lessons coming ? Come on , " I said , " I 'm a big boy now ; I 'm a Harvard A.M. too even if I wont have Heidelberg . Tell me . Is that really all you do when you are all cosy together ? practise talking ? " and he said : " Hush and let me talk awhile now . You 're going to Europe for the summer ; that 's my present to you . I have your tickets and your passport application ; all you need do is go down to the official photographer and get mugged. "  | " Why Europe ? and Why now ? Besides , what if I do nt want to go ? " and he said : " Because it may not be there next summer . So it will have to be this one . Go and look at the place ; you may have to die in it . " " Why not wait until then , then ? " and he said : " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still be a guest . " There were three of us ; by fast footwork and pullingall the strings we could reach , we even made the same boat . And that summer we  --  I : two of us at the last moment found themselves incapable of passing Paris  --  saw a little of Europe on a bicycle . I mean , that part still available : that presumable corridor of it where I might have to do Uncle Gavin 's dying : Britain , France , Italy  --  the Europe which Uncle Gavin said would be no more since the ones who survivedgetting rid of Hitler and Mussolini and Franco would be too exhausted and the ones who merely survived them would n't care anyway . So I did try to look at it , to see , since even at twenty-four I still seemed to believe what he said just as I believed him at fourteen and ( I presume : I cant remember ) at four . In fact , the Europe he remembered or thought he remembered was already gone . What I saw was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday in which everybody was a tourist , native and visitor alike . There were too many soldiers . I mean , too many people dressed as , and for the moment behaving like , troops , as if for simple police or temporary utility reasons they had to wear masquerade and add to the Maginot Line ( so that they  --  the French ones anyway  --  seemed to be saying , " Have a heart ; do nt kid us . We do nt believe it either . " ) right in the middle of the fight for the thirty-nine-hour week ; the loud parliamentary conclavesabout which side of Piccadilly or the Champs Elysees the sandbags would look best on like which side of the room to hang the pictures ; the splendid glittering figure of Gamelin still wiping the soup from his moustache and saying , " Be calm . I am here "  --  as though all Europe ( oh yes , us too ;  |p209the  place was full of Americans too ) were saying , " Since Evil is the thing , not only de rigueur but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it the Good . " Then me too in Paris for the last two weeks , to see if the Paris of Hemingway and the Paris of Scott Fitzgerald ( they were not the same ones ; they merely used the same room ) had vanished completely or not too ; then Cambridge again , only a day late : all of which , none of which that is , ties up with anything but only explains to me why it was almost a year and a half before I saw her again . And so we had Munich : that moment of respectful silence , then once more about our affairs ; and Uncle Gavin 's letter came saying " It wont be long now . " Except that it was probably already too late for me . When I had to go  --  no , I do nt mean that : when the time came for me to go  --  I wanted to be a fighter pilot . But I was already twenty-four now ; in six years I would be thirty and even now it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went to England in ' 1 6 and Uncle Gavin told me about one R.F.C. ( I mean R.A.F. now ) child who was a captain with such a record that the British government sent him back home and grounded him for good so that he might at least be present on the day of his civilian majority . So I would probably wind up as a navigator or engineer on bombers , or maybe at thirty they would n't let me go up at all . But still no wedding bells . Maybe it was the voice . My spies  --  I only needed one of course : Mother  --  reported that the private lessons were still going on , so maybe she felt that the Yes would not be dulcet enough yet to be legal . Which  --  legality  --  she would of course insist on , having tried cohabitation the first time au naturel you might say , and it blew up in her face . No , that 's wrong . The cohabitationdid n't blow up until after it became legal , until whicheverone it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ license and the preacher but please for sweet please sake shut up . " So now she would fear a minister or a j.p . like Satan or the hangman , since to appear before one in the company ofp210someone of the opposite sex would be the same as a death warrant . Which she certainly would not wish for Uncle Gavin , since not only was the Yes to him going to be tender enough to have brought her all the way back to Jefferson to say it , he would n't leave enough money to make it worth being his widow in case that Yes was n't so tender . No , that 's wrong too . If she had to shack up with a man for five years before he would consent to marry her , I mean , with a sculptor so advanced and liberal that even Gavin could n't recognise what he sculpted , made , he must have been pretty advanced in liberalism . And if he had to quit anything as safe and pleasant as being a Greenwich Village sculptor living with a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the grub whether he married her or not  --  if he had to quit all this to go to Spain to fight on what anybody could have told him would be the losing side , he must have been advanced even beyond just liberalism . And if she loved him enough to wait five years for him to say All right , dammit , call the parson , and then went to Spain to get blown up herself just to be with him , she must be one of them too since apparently you cant even be moderate about communism : you either violently are or violently are not . ( I asked him ; I mean of course Uncle Gavin . " Suppose she is , " he said . " All right , " I said . " So what the hell ? " he said . " All right , all right , " I said . " What the hell 's business is it of yours anyway ? " he said . " All right , all right , all right , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So there would be no wedding bells ; that other one had been a mere deviation due to her youth , not to happen again ; she was only for a moment an enemy of the people , and paid quickly for it . So there would be no preacher . They were just going to practise people 's democracy , where everybody was equal no matter what you looked like when he finally got your clothes off , right here in Jefferson . So all you had to figure out was , how the bejesus they would manage it in a town no bigger and equal than Jefferson . Or not they : he , Gavin . I mean ,  |p211it  would be his trouble , problem , perhaps need . Not hers . She was free , absolved of mundanity ; who knows , who is not likewise castrate of sound , circumcised from having to hear , of need too . She had the silence : that thunderclap instant to fix her forever inviolate and private in solitude ; let the rest of the world blunder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find first base at the edge of abyss like one of the old Chaplin films . He would have to find the ways and means ; all she would bring would be the capability for compliance , and what you might call a family precedence . Except that she was n't her mother , not to mention Gavin not being Manfred de Spain . I mean  --  I was only thirteen when Mrs Snopes shot herself that night so I still do nt know how much I saw and rememberedand how much was compelled onto or into me from Uncle Gavin , being , as Ratliff put it , as I had spent the first eleven or twelve years of my existence in the middle of Uncle Gavin , thinking what he thought and seeing what he saw , not because he taught me to but maybe just because he let me , allowed me to . I mean , Linda and Uncle Gavin would n't have that one matchless natural advantage which her mother and Manfred de Spain had , which was that aura , nimbus , condition , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed , lived , breathed , but created about herself by just existing , living , breathing . I do nt know what word I want : an aura not of license , unchastity , because ( this may even be Ratliff ; I do nt remember now ) little petty moral conditions like restraint and purity had no more connection with a woman like Mrs Snopes  --  or rather , a woman like her had no more concern with or even attention for them  --  than conventions about what force you use or when or how or where have to do with wars or cyclones . I mean , when a community suddenly discovered that it has the sole ownership of Venus for however long it will last , she can not , must not be a chaste wife or even a faithful mistress whether she is or not or really wants to be or not . That would be not only intolerable , but a really criminalp212waste ; and for the community so accoladed to even condone , let alone abet , the chastity , continence , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like havingall miraculous and matchless season  --  wind , sun , rain , heat and frost  --  concentrated into one miraculous instant over the county , then us to try to arrogate to ourselves the puny right to pick and choose and select instead of every man woman and child that could walk turning out to cultivate to the utmost every seed the land would hold . So we  --  I mean the men and the women both  --  would not even ask to escape the anguish and uproar she would cause by breathing and existing among us and the jealousy we knew ourselves to be unworthy of , so long as we did have one who could match and cope with her in fair combat and so be our championand pride like the county ownership of the fastest horse in the country . We would all be on hers and De Spain 's side ; we would even engineer and guard the trysts ; only the preachers would hate her because they would be afraid of her since the god she represented without even trying to , for the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at least one of their sex was its ambassador , was a stronger one than the pale and desperate Galilean who was all they had to challenge with . Because Linda did n't have that quality ; that one was not transferable . So all that remained for her and Gavin was continence . To put it crudely , morality . Because where could they go . Not to her house because between her and her father , the wrong one was deaf . And not to his because the house he lived in was n't his but Mother 's and one of the earliest ( when the time came of course ) principles he taught me was that a gentleman does not bring his paramour into the home of : in this order : His wife . His mother . His sister . His mistress . And they could n't make the coincidental trips to the available places in Memphis or New Orleans or maybeas far away as St Louis and Chicago that ( we assumed ) her mother and Manfred de Spain used to make , since even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which they would have had to resort , would have revolted at the idea of seducing a stone-deaf woman from the safety and innocence of her country home town , to such a purpose . So that left only his automobile , concealed desperatelyand frantically behind a bush  --  Gavin Stevens , aged fifty , M.A. Harvard , Ph.D . Heidelberg , LI.B . Mississippi , American Field Service and Y.M.C.A. , France , 1915-1918 , County Attorney ; and Linda Kohl , thirty , widow , wounded in action with the communist forces in Spain , fumbling and panting in a parked automobile like they were seventeen years old . Especially when the police found out ( I mean if , of course , if somebody came and told them ) that she was a communist . Or Jefferson either , for that matter . We had two Finns who had escaped by the skin of their teeth from Russia in 1917 and from Europe in 1919 and in the early twenties wound up in Jefferson ; nobody knew why  --  one the cobbler who had taken over Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were not professed communists nor confessed either since they still spoke too little English by the time Mr Roosevelt 's N.R.A . and the labor unions had made " communist " a dirty word referring mostly to John L. Lewis 's C.I.O. In fact , there was no need as they saw it to confess or profess either . They simply took it for granted that there was a proletariat in Jefferson as specific and obviousand recognisable as the day 's climate , and as soon as they learned English they would find it and , all being proletarianstogether , they would all be communists together too as was not only their right and duty but they could n't help themselves . That was fifteen years ago now , though the big one , the cobbler , the one slower at learning English , was still puzzled and bewildered , believing it was simply the barrier of language instead of a condition in which the Jeffersonproletariat declined not only to know it was the proletariatbut even to be content as the middle class , being convinced instead that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn Mr Snopes 's bank or Wall/street Snopes 's wholesale grocery chain or ( who knows ? ) on the way to the governor 's mansion in Jackson or even the White House in Washington . The little one , the tinsmith , was quicker than that . Maybe , as distinct from the cobbler 's sedentary and more meditative trade , he got around more . Anyway he had learned some time ago that any proletariat he became a member of in Jefferson he would have to manufacture first . So he set about it . The only means he had was to recruit , convert communists , and the only material he had were Negroes . Because among us white male Jeffersons there was one concert of unanimity , no less strong and even louder at the bottom , extending from the operators of Saturday curb-side peanutandpopcorn-vending machines , through the side-street and back-alley grocers , up to the department-store owners and automobile and gasoline agencies , against everybody they called communists now  --  Harry Hopkins , Hugh Johnson and everybody else associated with N.R.A. , Eugene Debs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed even to question our native-born Jefferson right to buy or raise or dig or find anything as cheaply as cajolery or trickery or threat or force could do it , and then sell it as dear as the necessity or ignorance or timidity of the buyer would stand . And that was what Linda had , all she had in our alien capitalist waste this far from home if she really was a communist and communismreally is not just a political ideology but a religion which has to be practised in order to stay alive  --  two Arctic Circle immigrants : one practically without human language , a troglodyte , the other a little quick-tempered irreconcilable hornet because of whom both of them were already well advanced outside the Jefferson pale , not by being professed communists ( nobody would have cared how much of a communistthe little one merely professed himself to be so long as he did n't actually interfere with local wage scales , just as they could have been Republicans so long as they did n't try to interfere with our Democratic town and county electionsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up prayer meetings ) but Negro lovers : consorters , political affiliators with Negroes . Not social consorters : we would not have put up with that from even them and the little one anyway knew enough Jefferson English to know it . But association of any sort was too much ; the local police were already looking cross-eyed at them even though we did n't really believe a foreigner could do any actual harm among our own loyal colored . So , you see , all they  --  Gavin and Linda  --  had left now was marriage . Then it was Christmas 1938 , the last one before the lights began to go out , and I came home for the holidays and she came to supper one night . Not Christmas dinner . I do nt know what happened there : whether Mother and Gavin decided it would be more delicate to ask her and let her decline , or not ask her at all . No , that 's wrong . I 'll bet Mother invited them both  --  her and old Snopes too . Because women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the men have been bloodying their heads against for years ; whereupon you find that the fact not only was n't important , it was n't really there . She invited them both , exactly as if she had been doing it whenevershe thought of it maybe at least once a month for the last hundred years , whenever she decided to give them a little pleasure by having them to a meal , or whenever she decided it would give her pleasure to have them whether they thought so or not ; and Linda declined for both of them in exactly the same way . So you can imagine that Christmas dinner in that house that nobody I knew had seen the inside of except Mother ( oh yes , she would have by now , with Linda home again ) and Uncle Gavin : the dining room  --  table chairs sideboard cabinets chandeliers and all  --  looking exactly as it had looked in the Memphis interior decorator 's warehouse when he  --  Snopes  --  traded in Major de Spain 's mother 's furniture for it , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other and the yardman in a white coat serving them  --  the old fish-blooded son of a bitch who had a vocabulary ofp216two words , one being No and the other Foreclose , and the bride of silence more immaculate in that chastity than ever Caesar 's wife because she was invulnerable too , forever safe , in that chastity forever pure , that could n't have heard him if he had had anything to say to her , any more than he could have heard her , since he would n't even recognise the languageshe spoke in . The two of them sitting there face to face through the long excruciating ritual which the day out of all the days compelled ; and nobody to know why they did it , suffered it , why she suffered and endured it , what ritual she served or compulsion expiated  --  or who knows ? what portent she postulated to keep him reminded . Maybe that was why . I mean , why she came back to Jefferson . Evidently it was n't to marry Gavin Stevens . Or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supper , though Mother would have said ( and unshakably believed ) that it was in honor of me being at home again . And did n't I just say that women are wonderful ? She  --  Linda : a present from Guess Who  --  had a little pad of thin ivory leaves just about big enough to hold three words at a time , with gold corners , on little gold rings to turn the pages , with a little gold stylus thing to match , that you could write on and then efface it with a handkerchief or a piece of tissue or , in a mere masculine emergency , a little spit on your thumb and then use it again ( sure , maybe he gave it to her in return for that gold cigarette lighter engraved G L S when he did n't have L for his middle initial or in fact any middle initial at all , that she gave him about five years ago that he never had used because nobody could unconvince him he could taste the fluid through his cob pipe ) . And though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just coincidental , like any other gesture of the hands while talking . Because she was talking to Linda at the same time , not even watching her hand but looking at Linda instead , so that she could n't have decipheredthe marks she was making even provided she was making marks , just talking away at Linda exactly as she didp217to the rest of us . And be damned if Linda would n't seem to understand her , the two of them chattering and babbling away at one another like women do , so that maybe no women ever listen to the other one because they do nt have to , they have already communicated before either one begins to speak . Because at those times Linda would talk . Oh yes , Gavin 's voice lessons had done some good because they must have , there had been too many of them or anyway enough of them , assuming they did spend some of the time together trying to soften down her voice . But it was still the duck 's voice : dry , lifeless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no passion , no heat in it ; and , what was worse , no hope . I mean , in bed together in the dark and to have more of love and excitementand ecstasy than just one can bear and so you must share it , murmur it , and to have only that dry and lifeless quack to murmur , whisper with . This time ( there were other suppers during the next summer but this was the first one when I was at table too ) she began to talk about Spain . Not about the war . I mean , the lost war . It was queer . She mention edit now and then , not as if it had never happened but as if their side had n't been licked . Some of them like Kohl had been killed and a lot of the others had had the bejesus blown out of the eardrums and arms and legs like her , and the rest of them were scattered ( and in no time now would begin to be proscribed and investigated by the F.B.I. , not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't quite reached that yet ) but they had n't been whipped and had n't lost anything at all . She was talking about the people in it , the people like Kohl . She told about Ernest Hemingway and Malraux , and about a Russian , a poet that was going to be better than Pushkin only he got himself killed ; and Mother scribbling on the pad but not paying any more attention to what she thought she was writing than Linda was , saying , " Oh , Linda , no ! "  --  you know : how tragic , to be cut offp218so young , the work unfinished , and Gavin taking the pad away from Mother but already talking too : " Nonsense . There 's no such thing as a mute inglorious Milton . If he had died at the age of two , somebody would still write it for him . " Only I did n't bother with the pad ; I doubt if I could have taken it away from them . " Named Bacon or Marlowe , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare , " Uncle Gavin said . But Linda had n't even glanced at the pad . I tell you , she and Mother did n't need it . " Why ? " she said . " What line or paragraph or even page can you compose and write to match giving your life to say No to people like Hitler and Mussolini ? " and Gavin not bothering with the pad either now : " She 's right . She 's absolutely right , and thank God for it . Nothing is ever lost . Nothing . Nothing . " Except Linda of course . Gavin said how Kohl had been a big man , I do nt mean just a hunk of beef , but virile , alive ; a man who loved what the old Greeks meant by laughter , who would have been a match for , competent to fulfill , any woman 's emotionaland physical life too . And Linda was just thirty now and oh yes , the eyes were beautiful , and more than just the eyes ; maybe it never mattered to Kohl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else lucky enough to succeed him , including Uncle Gavin . So now I understood at last what I was looking at : neither Mother nor Linda either one needed to look at what Mother thought she was scribbling on that damned ivory slate , since evidently from the second day after Linda got home Mother had been as busy and ruthless and undevious as one of the old Victorian headhuntingmamas during the open season at Bath or TunbridgeWells in Fielding or Dickens or Smollett . Then I found out something else . I remembered how not much more than a year ago we were alone in the office and Ratliff said , " Look-a-here , what you want to waste all this goodp219weather being jealous of your uncle for ? Somebody 's bound to marry him sooner or later . Someday you 're going to outgrowhim and you 'll be too busy yourself jest to hang around and protect him . So it might jest as well be Linda . " You see what I mean ? that evidently it was transferable . I mean , whatever it was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was thirteen years old , and look what happened to him . Then Barton Kohl saw her once when she was nineteen years old , and look where he was now . And now I had seen her twice , I mean after I was old enough to know what I was looking at : once at the Memphis airport last summer , and here tonight at the supper table , and now I knew it would have to be me to take Uncle Gavin off to the library or den or wherever such interviews happen , and say : " Look here , young man . I know how dishonorable your intentions are . What I want to know is , how serious they are . " Or if not him , at least somebody . Because it would n't be him . Ratliff had told me how Gavin said her doom would be to love once and lose him and then to mourn . Which could have been why she came back to Jefferson : since if all you want is to grieve , it does n't matter where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even lost that remaining one who should have married her for no other reason than that he had done more than anybody else while she was a child to make her into what she was now . But it would n't be him ; he had his own prognosis to defend , make his own words good no matter who anguished and suffered . Yes , lost . She had been driving that black **37;1048;TOOLONG ever since she got home ; apparentlyshe had assumed at first that she would drive it alone , until old Snopes himself objected because of the deafness . So each afternoon she would be waiting in the car when the bank closed and the two of them would drive around the adjacent country while he could listen for the approaching horns if any . Which  --  the country drives  --  was in his charactersince the county was his domain , his barony  --  thep220acres , the farms , the crops  --  since even where he did n't alreadyhold the mortgage , perhaps already in process of foreclosure even , he could measure and calculate with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , except one afternoon a week , usually Wednesday . Old Snopes neither smoked nor drank nor even chewed tobacco ; what his jaws worked steadily on was , as Ratliff put it , the same little chunk of Frenchman 's Bend air he had brought in his mouth when he moved to Jefferson thirty years ago . Yes , lost : it was n't even to Uncle Gavin : it was Ratliff she went to that afternoon and said , " I cant find who sells the whiskey now . " No , not lost so much , she had just been away too long , explaining to Ratliff why she had n't gone to Uncle Gavin : " He 's the County Attorney ; I thought  --  " and Ratliff patting her on the back right there in the street , saying for anybody to hear it since obviously she could n't : " You been away from home too long . Come on . We 'll go git him . " So the three of them in Gavin 's car drove up to Jakeleg Wattman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where and how herself next time . Which was to drive up to Jakeleg 's little unpainted store ( Jakeleg kept it unpainted so that whenever a recurrent new **27;1087;TOOLONG would notify him he had to be raided again , Jakeleg would n't have a lot of paint to scratch up in drawing the nails and dismantling the sections and carryingthem another mile deeper into the bottom until the reform reached its ebb and he could move back convenient to the paved road and the automobiles ) and get out of the car and step inside where the unpainted shelves were crowded with fishhooks and sinkers and lines and tobacco and flashlight batteries and coffee and canned beans and shotgun shells and the neat row of United States Internal Revenue Department liquor licenses tacked on the wall and Jakeleg in the flopping rubber hip boots he wore winter and summer with a loaded pistol in one of them , behind the **34;1116;TOOLONG , and you would say , " Howdy , Jake . What you got today ? " And he would tell you : the same one brand like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , and the same one price like he did n't give a damn whether that suited you either . And as soon as you said how many the Negro man ( in the flopping hip boots Jakeleg had worn last year ) would duck out or down or at least out of sight and reappear with the bottles and stand holding them until you had given Jakeleg the money and got your change ( if any ) back and Jakeleg would open the wicket in the wire and shove the bottles through and you would return to your car and that was all there was to it ; taking ( Uncle Gavin ) Linda right on in with him , saying as likely as not : " Howdy , Jake . Meet Mrs Kohl . She cant hear but there 's nothing wrong with her taste and swallowing . " And maybe Linda said , " What does he have ? " and likely what Uncle Gavin wrote on the pad for that was Thats fighting talk here This is a place where you take it or leave it Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So next time maybe she came alone . Or maybe Uncle Gavin himself walked into the bank and on to that little room at the back and said , " Look here , you old fish-blooded son of a bitch , are you going to just sit here and let your only female daughter that wont even hear the trump of doom , drive alone up yonder to Jakeleg Wattman 's bootleg joint to buy whiskey ? " Or maybe it was simple coincidence : a Wednesday afternoon and he  --  Mr Snopes  --  cant say , " Here , hold on ; where the hell you going ? This ai nt the right road . " Because she cant hear him and in fact I do nt know how he did talk to her since I cant imagine his hand writing anything except adding a percent symbol or an expiration date ; maybe they just had a county road map he could point to that worked up until this time . So now he had not one dilemma but three : not just the bank president 's known recognisable car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it ; then the dilemma of whether to let every prospective mortgagee in Yoknapatawpha County hear how he would sit there in the car and let his only femalep222child walk into a notorious river-bottom joint to buy whiskey , or go in himself and with his own Baptist deacon 's hand pay out sixteen dollars ' worth of his own life 's blood . Lost . Gavin told me how over a year ago the two Finn communists had begun to call on her at night ( at her invitationof course ) and you can imagine this one . It would be the parlor . Uncle Gavin said she had fixed up a sitting room for herself upstairs , but this would be in the parlor diagonallyacross the hall from the room where old Snopes was supposed to spend all his life that did n't take place in the bank . The capitalist parlor and the three of them , the two Finnish immigrant laborers and the banker 's daughter , one that could n't speak English and another that could n't hear any language , trying to communicate through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talking of hope , millennium , dream : of the emancipation of man from his tragedy , the liberation at last and forever from pain and hunger and injustice , of the human condition . While two doors away in the room where he did everything but eat and keep the bank 's cash money , with his feet propped on that little unpaintedledge nailed to his Adam fireplace and chewing steadily at what Ratliff called his little chunk of Frenchman 's Bend air  --  the capitalist himself who owned the parlor and the house , the very circumambience they dreamed in , who had begun life as a nihilist and then softened into a mere anarchist and now was not only a conservative but a tory too : a pillar , rock-fixed , of things as they are . Lost . Shortly after that she began what Jefferson called meddling with the Negroes . Apparently she went without invitation or warning , into the different classrooms of the Negro grammar and high school , who could n't hear thunder , mind you , and so all she could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pupils and teachers both who were already spooked , perhaps alarmed , anyway startled and alerted to cover , by the sudden presence of the unexplained white woman who was presently talking to the teacher in the quacking duck 's voice of the deaf and then holding out ap223tablet and pencil for the teacher to answer . Until presently , as quick as the alarmed messenger could find him I suppose , the principal was there  --  a college-bred man , Uncle Gavin said , of intelligence and devotion too  --  and then she and the principal and the senior woman teacher were in the principal'soffice , where it probably was not so much that she , the white woman , was trying to explain , as that they , the two Negroes , had already divined and maybe understood even if they did not agree with her . Because they , Negroes , when the problems are not from the passions of want and ignoranceand fear  --  gambling , drink  --  but are of simple humanity , are a gentle and tender people , a little more so than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little wiser in their dealings with white people than white people are with them , because they have had to survive in a minority . As if they already knew that the ignorance and superstition she would have to combat  --  the ignorance and superstition which would counteract , cancel her dream and , if she remainedbullheaded enough in perseverance , would destroy her  --  would not be in the black race she proposed to raise but in the white one she represented . So finally the expected happened , anticipated by everyone except her apparently , maybe because of the deafness , the isolation , the solitude of living not enclosed with sound but merely surrounded by gestures . Or maybe she did anticipate it but , having been through a war , she just did n't give a damn . Anyway , she bulled right ahead with her idea . Which was to establish a kind of competitive weekly test , the winners , who would be the top students for that week in each class , to spend the following week in a kind of academy she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later but for temporary they would use her sitting room in her father 's house for a sort of general precept , the winners of each week to be replaced by next week 's winners ; these to embrace the whole school from kindergarden to seniors , her theory being that if you were old enough to be taught at eighteen you were old enough at eight too when learning something newp224would be even easier . Because she could n't hear , you see , not just the words but the tones , over- and under-tones of alarm , fright , terror in which the black voice would have to say Thank you . So it was the principal himself who finally came to see Uncle Gavin at the office  --  the intelligent dedicatedman with his composed and tragic face . " I 've been expecting you , " Uncle Gavin said . " I know what you want to say . " " Thank you , " the principal said . " Then you know yourselfit wont work . That you are not ready for it yet and neither are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with you , " Uncle Gavin said . " None of them will , " the principal said . " Just as none of them agreed when Mr Washington said it . " " Mr Washington ? " " Booker T. , " the principal said . " Mr Carver too . " " Oh , " Uncle Gavin said . " Yes ? " " That we have got to make the white people need us first . In the old days your people did need us , in your economy if not your culture , to make your cotton and tobacco and indigo . But that was the wrong need , bad and evil in itself . So it could n't last . It had to go . So now you do nt need us . There is no place for us now in your culture or economy either . We both buy the same installment-plan automobiles to burn up the same gasoline in , and the same radios to listen to the same music and the same iceboxes to keep the same beer in , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of our own in your culture and economy too . Not you to make a place for us just to get us out from under your feet , as in the South here , or to get our votes for the aggrandisementof your political perquisites , as in the North , but us to make a place for ourselves by compelling you to need us , you can not do without us because nobody else but us can fill that place in your economy and culture which only we can fill and so that place will have to be ours . So that you will not just say Please to us , you will need to say Pleasep225to us , you will want to say Please to us . Will you tell her that ? Say we thank her and we wont forget this . But to leave us alone . Let us have your friendship all the time , and your help when we need it . But keep your patronage until we ask for it . " " This is not patronage , " Uncle Gavin said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the principal said . " I know that too . I 'm sorry . I am ashamed that I . . . " Then he said : " Just say we thank her and will remember her , but to let us alone . " " How can you say that to someone who will face that much risk , just for justice , just to abolish ignorance ? " " I know , " the principal said . " It 's difficult . Maybe we cant get along without your help for a while yet , since I am already asking for it .  --  Good day , sir , " he said , and was gone . So how could Uncle Gavin tell her either . Or anybody else tell her , everybody else tell her , white and black both . Since it was n't that she could n't hear : she would n't listen , not even to the unified solidarity of No in the Negro school itself  --  that massive , not resistance but immobility , like the instinct of the animal to lie perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or maybe she did hear that because she reversed without even stopping , from the school to the board of education itself : if she could not abolish the ignoranceby degrees of individual cases , she would attempt it wholesale by putting properly educated white teachers in the Negro school , asking no help , not even from Gavin , hunting down the school board then , they retreating into simple evaporation , the county board of supervisors in their own sacred lair , armed with no petty ivory tablet and gold stylus this time but with a vast pad of yellow foolscap and enough pencils for everybody . Evidently they committed the initial error of letting her in . Then Gavin said it went something like this : The president , writing : Assuming for the moment just for argument you understand that we substitute white teachersp226in the negro school what will become of the negro teachers or perhaps you plan to retire them on pensions yourselfThe duck 's voice : " Not exactly . I will send them North to white schools where they will be accepted and trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming for the sake of argument we have got the negro teachers out where will you find white teachers to fill vacancies left by negroes in Mississippi and how long do you think they will be permitted to fill negro vacancies in MississippiThe duck 's voice : " I will find them if you will protect them . " The pencil : Protect them from who Mrs Kohl Only she did n't need to answer that . Because it had already started : the words Nigger Lover scrawled huge in chalk on the sidewalkin front of the mansion the next morning for her father to walk steadily through them in his black banker 's hat and his little snap-on bow tie , chewing his steady chunk of Frenchman 's Bend air . Sure he saw it . Gavin said nobody could have helped seeing it , that by noon a good deal of the rest of Jefferson had managed to happen to pass by to look at it . But what else  --  a banker , THE banker  --  could he do ? spit on his handkerchief and get down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out on her way back to the courthouse to badger the rest of the county authorities back behind their locked doors . And maybe , very likely , she really did n't see it . Anyway , it was n't either of them nor the cook nor the yardman either . It was a neighbor , a woman , who came with a broom and at least obscured it , viciously , angrily , neither to defend Linda 's impossible dream nor even in instinctive female confederation with another female , but because she lived on this street . The words could have been the quick short primer-bald words of sex or excrement , as happened now and then even on sidewalks in this part of town , and she would have walked through them too since to pause would have been public admission that a lady knew what they meant . But nobody was going to write Niggerp227Lover nor - Hater either , delineate in visible taunting chalk that ancient subterrene atavistic ethnic fear on the sidewalk of the street she ( and her husband of course ) lived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board of supervisors crossed the Square to the bank and on to that back room where old Snopes sat with his feet propped on that mantelpiecebetween foreclosures , and I would have liked to hear that : the outsider coming in and saying , more or less : Cant you for God 's sake keep your daughter at home or at least out of the courthouse . In desperation , because what change could he have hoped to get back , she was not only thirty years old and independent and a widow , she was a war veterantoo who had actually  --  Ratliff would say , actively  --  stood gunfire . Because she did n't stop ; it had got now to where the board of supervisors did n't dare unlock their door while they were in session even to go home at noon to eat , but instead had sandwiches from the Dixie Cafe passed in through the back window . Until suddenly you were thinking how suppose she were docile and amenable and would have obeyed him , but it was he , old Snopes , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quit . You did n't know why of course . All you could do was speculate : on just what I.O.U . or mortgage bearing his signature she might have represented out of that past which had finally gained for him that back room in the bank where he could sit down and watch himselfgrow richer by lending and foreclosing other people 's I.O.U . ' s . Because pretty soon he had something more than just that unsigned Nigger Lover to have to walk through practically any time he came out his front door . One night ( this was while I was in Europe ) a crude cross soaked in gasoline blazed suddenly on the lawn in front of the mansion until the cops came and put it out , outraged and seething of course , but helpless ; who  --  the cops  --  would still have been helpless even if they had n't been cops . You know : if she had only lived alone , or had been the daughter of a mere doctorp228or lawyer or even a minister , it would have been one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  right . Instead , she had to be the daughter of not just a banker but THE banker , so that what the cross really illuminated was the fact that the organisation which put it there were dopes and saps : if the sole defense and protection of its purity rested in hands which did n't  --  or what was worse , could n't  --  distinguish a banker 's front yard , the white race was in one hell of a fix . Then the next month was Munich . Then Hitler 's and Stalin'spact and now when he came out of his house in the morning in his black banker 's hat and bow tie and his little cud of Ratliff 's Frenchman 's Bend air , what he walked through was no longer anonymous and unspecific , the big scrawled letters , the three words covering the sidewalk before the house in their various mutations and combinations : KOHL COMMUNIST JEWJEW KOHL COMMUNISTCOMMUNIST KOHL JEWand he , the banker , the conservative , the tory who had done more than any other man in Jefferson or Yoknapatawpha County @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to walk through them as if they were not there or were in another language and age which he could not be expected to understand , with all Jefferson watching him at least by proxy , to see if his guard would ever drop . Because what else could he do . Because now you knew you had figured right and it actually was durst not , with that record of suc/cess and victory behind him which already had two deaths in it : not only the suicide which left her motherless , but if he had been another man except the one whose wife would finally have to shoot herself , he might have raised the kindof daughter whose Barton Kohl would n't have been a Jewish , ! sculptor with that Spanish war in his horoscope . Then in the very next second you would find you were thinking the exact opposite : that those words on his sidewalk he had to walk through every time he left home were no more portents and threats of wreckage and disaster to him than any other loan he had guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as money itself remained unabolished . That the last thing in the world he was thinking to himself was This is my cross ; I will bear it because what he was thinking was All I got to do now is keep folks thinking this is a cross and not a gambit . Then Poland . I said , " I 'm going now , " and Gavin said , " You 're too old . They would n't possibly take you for flight training yet , " and I said , " Yet ? " and he said , " Finish one more year of law . You do nt know what will be happening then , but it wont be what you 're looking at now . " So I went back to Cambridge and he wrote me how the F.B.I . was investigatingher now and he wrote me : I 'm frightened . Not about her . Not at what they will find out because she would tell them all that herself if it only occurred to them that the simple thing would be to come and ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how : ' he had at last quit beating on the locked door behind which the board of supervisors and the school board crouched holding their breath , and now she was merely meeting a class of small children each Sunday at one of the Negro churches , where she would read aloud in the dry inflectionlessquacking , not the orthodox Biblical stories perhapsbut at least the Mesopotamian folklore and the Nordic fairy tales which the Christian religion has arrogated into its seasonal observances , safe now since even the white ministerscould not go on record against this paradox . So now there was no more Jew Communist Kohl on the sidewalkp230and no more Nigger Lover either ( you would like to think , from shame ) to walk through in order to be seen daily on the Square : the bride of quietude and silence striding inviolatein the isolation of unhearing , immune , walking still like she used to walk when she was fourteen and fifteen and sixteen years old : exactly like a young pointer bitch just about to locate and pin down a covey of birds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gavin : " Tell her to tear up that god-damn party card , if she 's got one . Go on . Tell her . She cant help people . They are not worth it . They do nt want to be helped any more than they want adviceor work . They want cake and excitement , both free . Man stinks . How the hell can she have spent a year in a war that not only killed her husband and blew the bejesus out of the inside of her skull , but even at that price the side she was fighting for still lost , without finding that out ? Oh sure , I know , I know , you and Ratliff both have told me often enough ; if I 've heard Ratliff one time I 've heard him a hundred : Man ai nt really evil , he jest ai nt got any sense . ' But so much the more reason , because that leaves him completely hopeless , completely worthless of anybody 's anguish and effort and trouble . " Then I stopped , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to reach up to do it now but he did it exactly as he used to when I was half as tall and only a third as old , gentle and tender and stroking it a little , speaking quiet and gentle too : " Why do nt you tell her ? " he said . Because he is a good man , wise too except for the occasions when he would aberrate , go momentarily haywire and take a wrong turn that even I could see was wrong , and then go hell-for-leather , with absolutely no deviation from logic and rationality from there on , until he wound us up in a mess of trouble or embarrassmentthat even I would have had sense enough to dodge . But he is a good man . Maybe I was wrong sometimes to trust and follow him but I never was wrong to love him . " I 'm sorry , " I said.  | " Do nt be , " he said . " Just remember it . Do nt ever waste time regretting errors . Just do nt forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No : I just took advantage of him . It was the regular yearly Christmas-season supper that Ratliff cooked himself at his house and invited Uncle Gavin and me to eat it with him . But this time Gavin had to go to Jackson on some drainage-district business so I went alone , to sit in Ratliff 's immaculate little kitchen with a cold toddy of old Mr Calvin Bookwright 's corn whiskey that Ratliff seemed to have no trouble getting from him , though now , in his old age , with anybody else Mr Cal might sell it to you or give it to you or order you off his place , you never knew which ; sipping the cold toddy as Ratliff made them  --  first the sugar disssolved into a little water , then the whiskey added while the spoon still stirred gently , then rain water from the cistern to fill the glass  --  while Ratliff in a spotless white apron over one of the neat tieless faded blue shirts which he made himself , cooked the meal , cooking it damned well , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the cooking , the blending up to perfection 's ultimatemoment . Then he removed the apron and we ate it at the kitchen table , with the bottle of claret Uncle Gavin and I always furnished . Then with the coffee and the decanter of whiskey we moved ( as always ) to the little immaculate room he called his parlor , with the spotlessly waxed melodeonin the corner and the waxed chairs and the fireplace filled with fluted green paper in the summer but with a phony gas log in the winter , now that progress had reached , whelmed us , and the waxed table in the center of the room on which , on a rack under a glass bell , rested the Allanovna necktie  --  a rich not-quite-scarlet , not-quite-burgundy ground patterned with tiny yellow sunflowers each with a tiny blue center of almost the exact faded blue of his shirts , that he had brought home from New York that time three or four years ago when he and Gavin went to see Linda married and off to Spain , that I would have cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably cost whoever ( Gavin Ip232suppose ) paid for it around seventy-five dollars ; until that day when I inadvertently said something to that effect and Ratliff said , " I know how much . I paid it . It was a hundred and fifty dollars . " " What ? " I said . " A hundred and fifty ? " " There was two of them , " he said . " I never saw but one , " I said . " I doubt if you will , " he said . " The other one is a private matter . "  --  and beside it , the piece of sculpture that Barton Kohl had bequeathed him that , if Gavin was still looking for first base , I had already struck out because I did n't even know what it was , let alone what it was doing . " All it needs is that gold cigarette lighter she gave him , " I said . " The Linda Snopes room . " " No , " he said . " The Eula Varner room . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do . Leastways it 's something . When a community is lucky enough to be the community that every thousand years or so has a Eula Varner to pick it out to do her breathing in , the least we can do is for somebody to set up something ; a . . . monument ai nt quite the word I want . " " Shrine , " I said . " That 's it , " he said . " A shrine to mark and remember it , for the folks that was n't that lucky , that was already doomed to be too young . . . " He stopped . He stood there quite still . Except that you would think of him as being quizzical , maybespeculative , but not bemused . Then I said it : " You were wrong . They are n't going to . " " What ? " he said . " What 's that ? " " She 's not going to marry Gavin . " " That 's right , " he said . " It will be worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? What did you say ? " But he was already himself again , bland , serene , inscrutable . " But I reckon Lawyer can stand that too , " he said.  |p233I  could have suggested that , told her to do that , and she would have done it  --  torn the card up at once , quickly , immediately , with passion and exultation . She was like her mother in one thing at least : needing , fated to need , to find something competent enough , strong enough ( in her case , this case , not tough enough because Kohl was tough enough : he happened to be mere flesh and bones and so was n't durable enough ) to take what she had to give ; and at the same time doomed to fail , in this , her case , not because Barton failed her but because he also had doom in his horoscope . So if the Communist party , having already proved itself immune to bullets and therefore immortal , had replacedhim , not again to bereave her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with passion and exultation and joy too . Since what sacrifice can love demand more complete than abasement , abnegation , particularly at the price of what the unknowing materialist world would in its crass insensitiveignorance dub cowardice and shame ? I have always had a sneaking notion that that old Christian martyr actually liked , perhaps even loved , his aurochs or his lion . But I did suggest something else . It was 1940 now . The Nibelung maniac had destroyed Poland and turned back west where Paris , the civilised world 's eternal and splendid courtesan , had been sold to him like any whore and only the English national character turned him east again ; another year and Lenin 's Frankenstein would be our ally but too late for her ; too late for us too , too late for all the western world 's peace for the next hundred years , as a tubby little giant of a man in England was already saying in private , but needs must when the devil etcetera . It began in my office . He was a quiet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fifty , as they all appear , who showed me briefly the federal badge ( his name was Gihon ) and accepted the chair and saidp234Thank you and opened his business quietly and impersonally , as they do , as if they are simply delivering a not-tooimportantmessage . Oh yes , I was doubtless the last , the very last on his list since he would have checked thoroughly on or into me without my knowing it as he had days and maybe months ago penetrated and resolved and sifted all there was to be learned about her . " We know that all she has done , tried to do , has been done quite openly , where everybody would have a chance to hear about it , know about it  --  " " I think you can safely say that , " I said . " Yes , " he said . "  --  quite openly . Quite harmless . With the best of intentions , only not very . . . practical . Nothing in fact that a lady would n't do , only a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you . But there you are . I can tell you in confidence that she holds a Communist party card . Naturally you are not aware of that . " Now I said , " Thank you . " " And , once a communist  --  I grant you , that 's like the old saying ( no imputation of course , I 'm sure you understand that ) , Once a prostitute . Which anyone after calm reflection knows to be false . But there you are . This is not a time of calmness and reflection ; to ask or expect , let alone hope , for that from the government and the people too , faced with what we are going to have to meet sooner probably than we realise  --  " " Yes , " I said . " What do you want me to do ? What do you assume I can do ? " " She . . . I understand , have been informed , that you are her earliest and still are her closest friend  --  " " No imputation of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you in his turn . He did n't say anything , anything at all . He just sat there watching me through his glasses , gray , negative as a chameleon , terrifying as the footprint on Crusoe 's beach , too negative and neuter in that one frailp235articulation to bear the terrible mantle he represented . " What you want then is for me to use my influence  --  " "  --  as a patriotic citizen who is intelligent enough to know that we too will be in this war within five years  --  I set five years as an outside maximum since it took the Germans only three years before to go completely mad and defy us into that one  --  with exactly who for our enemy we may not know until it is already too late  --  " "  --  to persuade her to surrender that card quietly to you and swear whatever binding oath you are authorised to give her , " I said . " Did n't you just say yourself that Once a whore ( with no imputations ) always a whore ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In this case , not the one with the imputations . " " Then what do you want of me  --  her ? " He produced a small notebook and opened it ; he even had the days of the week and the hours : " She and her husbandwere in Spain , members of the Loyalist communist army six months and twenty-nine days until he was killed in action ; she herself remained , serving as an orderly in the hospital after her own wound , until the Loyalists evacuated her across the border into prance  --  " " Which is on record even right here in Jefferson . " " Yes , " he said . " Before that she lived for seven years in New York City as the common-law wife  --  " "  --  which of course damns her not only in Jefferson , Mississippi , but in Washington too . " But he had not even paused. "  --  of a known registered member of the Communist party , and the close associate of other known members of the Communist party , which may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " And then ? " He closed the notebook and put it back inside his coat and sat looking at me again , quite cold , quite impersonal , as if the space between us were the lens of a microscope . " So she knew people , not only in Spain but in the **29;1152;TOOLONG brought her a letter from Jimmy , glowing in every line with love and impatience for her . Jimmy said he was hobbling on a cane , but his leg was getting stronger every day and he felt fine . Miles told them the supply boat had reached Bellwood safely , and when they heard of the loss of Moncks Corner the crew had scattered , leaving the boat behind them . Tarleton 's raiders had gone down the other bank of the river and had not come near ; however , some days later , Bellwood had been visited by a British foraging party led by Cornwallis himself . They had come to the big house and stated that they wanted food . Of course the colored folks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the white folks were pretty scared too . But Cornwallis and his men had done everything in good order . They had taken a great deal of meat and corn , and some tons of feed for their horses , but there had been no insults to the women , no rough behavior of any sort . And they had left plenty of food  --  rice and grits , poultry and meat animals , besides the garden greens . The people at Bellwood had not suffered . Certainly , Miles said laughing , not nearly as much as he and Celia had suffered worrying about them . Herbert urged him to stay for a visit , but Miles said he had promised Jimmy to delay at Sea Garden no more than three or four days . Celia was glad of this . Much as she liked the Lacys , she was tired of being a guest . She wanted to go home . So now it was a fragrant June morning and they were ready to leave right after breakfast . Everything was arranged . Madge and Lewis were to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's maid , and a colored boy named Elby to help Amos take care of the horses . From Sea Garden to Bellwood was a ride of nearly thirty miles , too far for horses cumbered by saddlebags to go in one day . They planned to rest overnight at a hunting lodge that belonged to Herbert , and ride on to Bellwood tomorrow . Celia gave a little skip as she went into the dining room for breakfast . Vivian never came to breakfast , but everybody else wasp201there . The maids brought in hominy grits and butter and fresh broiled flounder . Everybody was in high spirits  --  or nearly everybody . Celia had finished her fish when it occurred to her that Herbert had said almost nothing , and his usually genial face looked grave . She wondered if he thought something might happen to them on the way to Bellwood . She did not know why he should worry , for while Clinton had taken their army weapons the men were all well armed from Herbert 's own gun-room . Miles remarked that they had better get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair and stood up . Before they left , he said , he would like to speak to them in the library . Puzzled and a little apprehensive , they followed him . Though she rarely left her room so early , Vivian was in the library , her coffee tray beside her . Closing the door , Herbert spoke to them without preliminary . " I 'm sure you have all guessed , " he said in a low , quiet voice , " that Luke has kept in touch with his mother . Last night he sent a piece of news that I think I should tell you . " Herbert paused a moment . Vivian sipped her coffee . " Among the men Luke has met in the swamps , " said Herbert , " there 's talk that Clinton has revoked the paroles . " There was a buzz of amazement . Celia said nothing because she did not know what Herbert was talking about . She was annoyed at this delay ; she wanted to start for Bellwood and Jimmy and her wedding , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the group had understood . Lewis was saying , " I do n't believe it . " " I do n't either , " said Miles . " If you believe all the talk you hear these days you 'll get wheels in your head . " " It would be utterly dishonorable , " said Burton . Vivian set down her cup . " Dishonorable , " she said dryly . " But not impossible . " There was another outburst of talk . They insisted it could not be true . Everybody knew how excitable Luke was . Celia remembered her betrothal ball , and how Luke had explodedinto the ballroom . She thought crossly that it seemed to be Luke 's mission in life to wreck her big moments . But if she could n't stop their gabble she might as well under/stand it . Herbert had sat down in a chair near hers . She plucked at his sleeve . " Please sir , " she said as he turned , " what does it mean ?  --  ' revoke the paroles ' ? " Herbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that Sir Henry Clinton is a liar . " Celia was astonished . Herbert did not often speak like this . He went on . " You 'll remember , when Clinton offered terms of surrender he guaranteed that if the militiamen would give up their arms , they and all the citizens of Charleston would be regarded as prisoners of war on parole . As long as they did not fight the king , they could go home and live in peace . " Of course she remembered . She had heard it often enough . Celia nodded . " Well , now that he has taken their guns , " said Herbert , " Luke hears that Clinton has posted notices in Charleston saying he did n't really mean that . Clinton says now that they must all take an oath as subjects of the king . This would mean that they could be called up for regiments to fight on the king 's side . " Celia sat up straight . " You mean  --  he says that Miles and Godfrey  --  and Jimmy  --  must turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered ? " " That 's right . " " But they wo n't ! " Herbert smiled . " No , they wo n't . " " What will he do to them ? " " I do n't know . " " But he promised  --  Miles told me  --  " Herbert nodded . " That 's not honest ! " " Of course it 's not , " said Herbert , " and I hope it 's not true . " He smiled again at her shocked face . " Actually , my dear , I do n't think it can be true . But I did think Miles and Lewis should hear it , because both of them  --  and Jimmy  --  are militamen on parole . " The voices of the other men were rough with disbelief . Celia bit her lip thoughtfully . There was that childish business of Clinton 's enrolling boys and Tories and old men as his prisonersp203of war . That was n't honest either . She remembered what Godfrey had said about Clinton 's wanting to be an earl . Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . Had n't Miles been telling them about the courteous behavior of Cornwallis when he came to Bellwood ? Yes , of course , Celia reflected . But then Cornwallis was already an earl . Anyway , she wished they would quit talking about it and get started toward her wedding . Watching Burton , excited and redfaced , she hoped that now he would get himself some new clothes . He was fairly oozing out of the clothes he had . In his reasonable way , Miles was saying that since they could not verify the rumor no matter how long they sat here talking , would n't they be wise to follow their plan to start for Bellwood early so they could rest in the heat of the day ? Madge , who had kept quiet until now , said yes , she thought so too . Celia stood up gratefully . So they said good-by , and started . They followed a track through the woods around Sea Garden , came out into open country , went into more woods . Now sometimes the road widened as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared among the trees . But Miles and Amos led the way without hesitation . They had played here as children , had hunted and fished and boated here as grown men , and they knew every wood-sign , every sound and scent , almost every tree . They reached Herbert 's hunting-lodge well before dark , and set out early the next morning . " How soon can we get to Bellwood ? " Celia asked Miles as they rode . He grinned at her . " Before noon . " He began to describe the place for her . A big white house with broad piazzas . A lot of outbuildings , and quarters for the servants and fieldhands . He said the main buildings were near the river , in a grove of oaks left from the original forest . Around the grove were the fields . However  --  Miles smiled an apology  --  she must not expect much of the fields this year . When he should have been directing the spring planting he had been in Charleston , so nothing much had been put in but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of him , getting the place in order.  |p204After  a while she dropped back . She was so happy , riding through the woodland and knowing that every step of her horse was bringing her nearer to Jimmy . Now in June the woods were glorious , the tall long-needled pines and the oaks hung with moss , the great banks of yellow jessamine making the air sweet , and such a profusion of birds and butterflies  --  Celia drew a long breath of the fragrant air and sighed with pleasure . Though the sun was bright , here under the great trees she was not uncomfortably warm . A wild grapevine had been clinging to a tree at the side of the trail , but it was broken , and its branches lay on the ground . She heard Miles call Amos . " Look at this , " Miles said as Amos rode up . He was indicating a hush of jessamine ahead . It too had been broken and trampled on . Miles asked , " What do you think , Amos ? " Amos answered without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles . " Lewis and Madge had been riding behind Celia . Now , noticing that something was amiss , Lewis hastened his horse and drew nearer to Miles . " What 's wrong ? " he called . Miles showed him the broken bushes , which now could be seen on both sides of the road . " Not fresh-broken , " Lewis said after a moment 's examination . " Could n't you and Amos have done it when you rode to Sea Garden last week ? " " Not so much . This was a good-sized party . " Celia stopped her horse and looked around her . The ground , thickly covered with leaves and pine-needles , showed no tracks , but she saw horse-droppings two or three days old . Miles and Amos were examining the bushes with the expert eyes of men who had learned woodlore from boyhood . Miles said , " These fellows were not headed Sea Garden way . They were riding toward Bellwood . I do n't like this , Lewis . " Behind her , Celia heard Madge telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance around with an encouragingsmile , but she too felt uneasy . The bushes , pressing on the road , were damaged as far ahead as she could see . Ahead of her she heard Lewis say , " I would n't be too concerned , Miles . We 're facing towardp205Charleston , and a lot of people are riding to Charleston these days . " " This is n't the main road to Charleston , " Miles returned shortly . " Could n't a party go to Charleston this way ? " " Could . Kind of roundabout , though . " " A good many people who left town are on their way home now , " Lewis suggested . " This might be the easiest way for some of them . " " Yes , " said Miles , " and foraging parties are still out getting supplies for the British garrison  --  " He shrugged , shook his head , and tried to laugh . " Oh , it 's a public road , anybody could have used it . I guess I 'm still on edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the siege . " Lewis agreed heartily that it certainly did . They rode on . Amos stayed by Miles , while Lewis dropped back again to talk to Madge . Celia was thinking . It was easy for Lewis to be cheerful . Lewis ' wife was here with him , his children were at Sea Garden . But all the people Miles loved best were at Bellwood . After a while Miles called her to catch up with him , and told her they had almost reached Bellwood . A few more miles of woods , then they would come into the clear , and could see ahead of them the Bellwood fields and the grove that shaded the buildings . He said nothing more about the signs of other horsemen on the road . As in Charleston he was trying to keep her cheerful , pretending to be sure everything was all right . But Celia was still worried . Again she fell back . Marietta asked if she felt all right . Celia said , " Oh yes , fine , " and told Marietta to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard Madge exclaim how beautiful the wild flowers were this year . Madge was so happy to have Lewis and Bobby safe from the Charleston siege that she was living in a rainbow world . Celia reflected that probably it was foolish of herself to be worried . As Miles had said , this was a public road ; , anybody could have used it . The woods softly enclosed her again .. It was like an enchantment  --  the chirps and rustling leaves , the swaying gray streamers of moss , the sweetness of jessamine . Celia. loved flower scents and the fresh clean smells of outdoors.  |p206But  as she rode along her nostrils caught a whiff that was not clean . Faint but foul , something else was mingling with the scents of the woods . The smell blew away , but in a minute or two she caught it again . This time it reminded her of the smell in a smoky room that had been shut up all night . But not exactly like that  --  besides the smoke smell there was something else befouling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to define it , then she thought  --  like what people meant when they said they smelt a dead rat.  |p207HEAD  OF HER , Miles was riding in silence . But the others were merry  --  Amos and Marietta laughing about something , the horse-boy Elby flirting with Madge 's maid , and Lewis telling Madge anecdotes of the siege. " ... no roosters crowed in the mornings , all eaten . People had even eaten their pet birds . On the lines we still had coffee -- - " Suddenly Miles turned his head . " What 's that smell ? " he exclaimed . Lewis and Madge did not hear him , but Amos did . Amos raised his head and sniffed , scowled , sniffed again . " I do n't know what it is , Mr. Miles . Sure is nasty . " Miles dug his heels into his horse 's flanks . " Conic on ! " he cried . " We 're just loafing along ! Celia  --  " But Celia had already caught up with him . " I low much farther , Miles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly there ! " he shouted back . She heard Lewis calling to them both . Ile caught up with them and urged them not to hurry so . The horses would stumble over one of these fallen branches , and then where would they be ? Reluctantly admitting the sense of this advice , they slowed to a more reasonable pace . As they rode along the smell grew heavier . It filled the air with a rank staleness . Whatever the source , theyp208were riding toward it , and they were riding toward Bellwood . Celia clamped her teeth on her lip , afraid lest sheer nervousness would make her cry out . The woods were less dense . The track widened . They were coming to the edge of the clearing where the fields of Bellwood lay . The smell thickened to a stench . Celia and Miles were side by side , ahead of the others . She gave him a sidelong glance . Miles ' lips were turned in toward his teeth and set in a hard thin line . Between his eyebrows were two ridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Bellwood were his wife and child , his mother and brother , the household servants who like Amos had been his friends and playmates from childhood . Miles was holding himself sternly in check , but he was in torture . Celia felt creepy all over , as if things were crawling on her skin . The back of her neck hurt . Now the air was so foul as to be almost unbearable . They came out of the woods . Below them lay the fields , hundreds of acres broken here and there by orchards and vineyards ; beyond , the Cooper River was like a silver ribbon in the sun ; and by the river , less than a mile from the edge of the clearing , was the grove of mighty oaks left from the forest to shelter the plantation buildings . With a groan of horror Miles jerked back on his bridle and stopped his horse . Celia stopped too , rigid with shock . The others rode up . She heard them exclaiming but she did not understand the words . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay Bellwood . And all over Bellwood was the sight and silence and smell of death . From the edge of the woods the ground sloped gently to the river-bank , so that she was looking downward over the fields . The grove was a mass of burnt tree-trunks standing like tall black sticks . Among them she saw chimneys , gaunt and dark against the bright river ; piles of ashes , charred pieces of wall standing crookedly , half-burnt timbers lying as they had fallen in the fire that had burned the great house at Bellwood and the smaller buildings around it.  |p209Around  the black ruin the fields were strewn with the dead bodies of animals . There were hundreds of them , pigs and sheep and cattle , flocks of poultry , colts and a few old horses . The bodies lay bloated and stinking in the sun . Some of the animals had been slaughtered for food , the meaty parts cut off and the rest left to rot ; others had simply been killed with bullets or bayonets to complete the work of destruction . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled over on their backs . Their legs stood up stiff in the air . From where Celia and the rest had stopped their horses , to the trees across the river , they could not see a moving creature except the buzzards circling above the corpses . The air was putrid with the stink of rotting flesh . Celia did not know how long she sat there in her saddle , not moving because she was nearly stunned . She had more impressions of voices . Vaguely , as if through a twilight , she saw Marietta on her knees vomiting . She felt a movement of her horse , and saw the dark hand of Amos grasping the bridle . She realized then that her horse had sensed the horror ahead and needed a controlling hand . Just as she saw Madge riding closer she heard a yelp of rage at her side and pounding of hoofs . Miles , who like herself had been paralyzed with shock , had come to his senses and had started at a gallop toward what used to be his home . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . heel she went after him . She heard Amos cry out " Miss Celia ! "  --  t hen she heard more hoofbeats behind her , but she did not look around . She was making a wild journey . It was a journey of filth and stench , dried blood on the ground and rotting entrails swarming with flies , carcasses scorched by scraps of fire blown from the big house . Her horse was scared and hard to manage . Celia was hardly aware of the horse . She had grown up on a plantation and was a good rider , and this was useful now ; with her heel and knee and hands she gave directions without thinking of what she was doing . All she could think of was getting to the black place where the house had been and finding out what had happened , and it seemed that it was taking her hours to get there . Ahead of her she heard Miles shouting , and behind her Amos.  |p210Miles  was calling Jimmy , Audrey , his mother . Amos called Jimmy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored folk who had grown up at Bellwood with him , his friends . Nobody answered . Overhead the buzzards squawked , angry to be thus annoyed at their feast . Now she was there . She sprang to the ground , and Amos yelled for Elby to come help him tie the horses . Celia looked at the black destruction . It covered even more ground than she had realized . Bellwood had been a spacious establishment . She could see the foundations of the great house , with the wide brick steps and marble carriageblockstill there . Behind the house she saw the kitchen  --  such solid brick that it was damaged less than the rest  --  and beyond that , burnt remnants of storehouses , stables , servants ' quarters , and she did not know what else , reaching away till she lost sight of them among the scorched tree-trunks . She was standing in what had been the driveway . This had curved away between two lines of trees , and those farthest from the house were still there , lacing their branches overhead . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see patches of trampled grass that had escaped the burning , and charred clumps of shrubbery . Scattered about the lawn she saw pieces of silver and china , broken furniture , a crystal decanter cracked and trodden into the earth . On one side a path led through what might have been a garden , and beyond that were more trees . On the other side she saw a big oblong enclosure bordered with fancy brick coping , like a flowerbed . Inside the coping the soft garden earth had been thrown up in a pile about four feet wide and seven or eight feet long . Celia had stood in a dazed silence as she stared at the rest of it . But when she saw that pile of earth it seemed that every nerve in her body trembled . She put her hand over her mouth and found that her mouth was open as if to scream , but she was not screaming . Her throat was stiff , and all that came out was a little croakingnoise like the sound of an animal in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore no marks of trampling hoofs . It was a new-made grave . She felt a hand gently taking hers . Madge Penfield was tryingp211to give her support . But it meant nothing . She could not respond , she simply could not . She stood rigid as a gatepost , staring . She saw Miles stumbling around among the ruins like a man not quite sane . He picked up the fragments of things that had been in his home , looked at them , put them back on the ground . Lewis was with him , trying to give sympathy as Madge was trying to give it to her , and getting no more response . A little way off Amos stood in the shadow of a scorched tree , shaking his head as if he knew it could not possibly be true and he would wake up in a minute . Beside him Marietta stood holding his hand . Farther off , Madge 's maid was sobbing a prayer , and Elby sat on the fallen branch of a tree murmuring , " Lord help us . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . Celia started , and Miles stopped short , holding a silver soup-ladle that he had picked up from the ground . He raised his head and listened . There was no mistake . From the far end of the grove beyond the garden , where the fire had not reached , they heard a dog barking . It was Amos who first recognized the bark . Amos leaped , he shouted . " Praise the Lord ! Mr. Miles  --  it 's Rosco ! " Before the words were well spoken he and Miles had started on a run toward the trees . They had gone only a few yards when Rosco calm running out of the thicket toward them , barking his welcome . They met him halfway and dropped on their knees , then as Miles hugged the dog Amos sprang up and shouted again . A big sturdy Negro man was coming out of the grove behind Rosco . Amos ran toward him . " Big Buck ! " he cried . " Oh , Big Buck  --  I never was so glad to see anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . For at the sight of him , Big Buck had sat down on the ground and started bawling like a baby . Followed by Rosco , Miles sprang up and crossed to where Big Buck sat sobbing . He grabbed the colored man 's shoulder and shook it , while Amos shook his other shoulder and the rest of them gathered round . Except for Celia they all knew Big Buck , and all of them together were demanding to know what had happened.  | " Where 's everybody ? " Miles exclaimed , and Amos , giving Big Buck another shake , ordered him , " Talk up , you ! Where 's the folks ? " As though he had understood the question , Rosco howled . Lewis put a hand on the dog 's head to quiet him . Still sitting on the ground , Big Buck struggled to say what he had to say . " The white folks is dead . " Nobody said anything . They stared at him blankly , like idiots . Overhead a buzzard squawked . Big Buck spoke again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Still nobody answered . It was as though every one of them had received a separate knock on the head . Big Buck added , " It was them green Tories and Tarleton . " He stopped again . He put his head down on his fist and shook with sobs . But at last Big Buck told his story . " It 's two days , maybe three days after Amos and Mr. Miles went to get Miss Celia . It 's in the morning , ten-eleven o'clock . We 're all busy because Mr. Jimmy he say , shine up everything before Miss Celia gets here . I 'm spadin ' up the flowerbed over yonder and Miss Beatrice is tellin ' me to make it real pretty for Miss Celia . The baby is upstairs fast asleep and Mr. Jimmy he 's on the porch tellin ' Miss Audrey what Miss Celia looks like . He 's got his cane by him because he ca n't walk by hisself . Then we see these men in green jackets come ridin ' out of the woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the house they start yellin ' and hollerin ' and shootin ' and they ride right across the fields . Miss Audrey she screams out and Mr. Jimmy he come hobblin ' down the front steps . He ca n't walk fast and by the time he gets out to the front the green men are all over the place . I do n't know how many but it sure seems like a lot , and the colored folks are runnin ' up and it seems like everybody is hollerin ' all at the same time and it 's hard to know what 's goin ' on . " But a fellow on a horse he rides straight to Mr. Jimmy and I hear him ask if he 's the man that owns the place . Mr. Jimmy he says no , the man that owns the place is his brother and he 's notp213home . And the fellow on the horse and two-three others with him , they bawl out yes , that 's what they thought , Mr. Miles is gone to North Carolina to join the rebel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do n't know any man name Sumter . He say anyway his brother ai n't gone to join no rebel troops , his brother give parole in Charleston . And the men on the horses they holler back and say there ai n't no more paroles . They say everybody got to join them now and they say Miles Rand is gone like Sumter . They say they 'll do to him what they did to Sumter and this will teach Miles Rand he better fight for the king . " And I hear Mr. Jimmy talkin ' back to them . Shoutin ' mad he is . Mr. Jimmy say not he nor his brother will ever fight for the king . And then there 's a gunshot and he falls down . " I try to run help Mr. Jimmy but all the folks is screamin ' and yellin ' and runnin ' around so I ca n't get nowhere . The green men is ropin ' the colored folks and tyin ' them together , and one of them grabs me but I 've got my spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kneelin ' on the ground by Mr. Jimmy and I hear her moanin ' . " Then I see more green men comin ' out of the house loaded up with things , mirrors and bottles and forks and spoons and all like that . They stuff their shirts full of things and carry all they can hold besides , and a lot of them are uncorkin ' bottles and takin ' drinks . Some of ' em try to catch me again and I run around and hide in a cabin . But there 's a lot of the colored folks hidin ' in the cabins and the green men set the cabins on fire so the f ol ks would have to run out and they could catch ' em and tic ' cut up . " When I run out I see the stables are on fire too , and the trees and the big house . I run around to the front and there 's a green man draggin ' Miss Audrey out of the house and her sercantin ' and fightin ' . He hollers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything in there is on fire and she 'll catch fire too . But she screams back that her baby is in there and he ca n't keep her out . And he ca n't . All of a sudden she breaks away from the man and runs indoors and everybody is scared to go after her because now the fire is comin ' out of the windows . All around they 's shootin ' the animals and ropin ' the folks , and there 's howlin ' andp214screamin ' and I hear one green man say these folks will bring good prices in the West Indies and make them all rich . " I 'm so scared I ca n't hardly move but I know I got to move and I knock down another green man , maybe more than one , and I run around and around so they ca n't catch me . And all of a sudden I hear Miss Audrey scream again and I look up and there she is at a window upstairs with the baby , and the whole house is burnin ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she jumps out of the window and she sort of turns over in the air and her head hits the ground and there she lies , not movin ' , and the baby underneath her . And some green man runs over to her and hollers out this is a crime . But I do n't know what else he says because just then another green man he grabs me and I sec he 's got a rope and I knock him over and I start to run . " I just run . I ai n't lookin ' to see where I 'm goin ' . I do n't sec anything , I just run . I get to the trees and I run and run and somewhere in there I run right into a tree and I fall down on my face . I hear all kinds of noise and I see smoke but I just lie on the ground because it seems like I ca n't breathe no more and I ca n't get up . " I reckon I fainted or sornp'n because after a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time but I do n't know how long , only now everything is quiet . The fire is burnt down but I 'm still scared . I 'm scared to go back and scared to stay where I am . Then I hear a dog and after a while Resco comes sniffin ' up and he finds me . I do n't know why they ai n't killed Rosco , maybe they figure ca n't nobody ride him or eat him so he ai n't no use , or maybe he run away like me . Rosco howls and hollers and grabs my clothes and tries to drag me back . At first I 'm scared to go but then I figure that if there was any of them green men still here they could have found me by now with all the racket Rosco is makin ' . So I let him bring me back . " And there I see the house all smokin ' and everything is like you see it now . The green men have took all the horses except a few they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat they could carry and what they did n't take they killed just like you see . And everything is quiet like a graveyard exceptp215Rosco whimperin ' . And then I see Miss Beatrice comin ' to meet me . " Miss Beatrice looks like crazy . Her clothes are all torn and dirty and her hair is come down and her hands are cut and bloody . But she glad to see me . All the other colored folks is took away and he did n't know even one was left . " Miss Beatrice ca n't hardly talk but she wants to talk . She saythe man that shot Mr. Jimmy killed him right there . And MissAudrey and the baby died from jumpin ' out of the window . AndMiss Beatrice done dragged them all three yonder to the flowerbed . She had picked up my spade and she was tryin ' all by herself to dig a grave . " But Miss Beatrice ai n't strong enough to dig a grave and I say let me do it . She stands up there and watches me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the baby and Miss Audrey . I think Miss Audrey 's neck is broke and the baby 's head got broke when he hit the ground . Miss Beatrice just stands there like astick only she keeps talkin ' . Not talkin ' like somebody that 's got somp'n to say but just talkin ' . Same words over and over . This will teach Miles Rand he better fight for the king . This will teach Miles Rand he better fight for the king . Over and over like that . " I get the grave dug and put in Miss Audrey and the baby and then I pick up Mr. Jimmy . And Miss Beatrice she falls over on the ground . I try to help her but there ai n't a thing to do . Her heart is stopped beatin ' . Just like that . So I have to put her in the grave too and I cover them up and then I 'm scared to stay around any more and I take Rosco and go off and hide in the trees yonder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back but they do n't . Ai n't nobody been here till you folks come today . " And that 's what happened , Mr. Miles . And I wish somebody had to tell it to you besides me . " Somewhere near by the other Negroes had begun a chant . It was a low musical keening , every other line a plea of " Lord have mercy , Lord have mercy . "  |p216Celia  heard them . She was sitting on the ground . She still sat there . Lord have mercy , Lord have mercy . Miles stood up . He took his pistol out of the holster at his side . Madge gave a cry of alarm and Lewis sprang to his feet . Withoutpausing Miles strode across to Rosco and shot him in the head . He spoke over his shoulder . " Why make him live without Jimmy ? " he asked  |p217ELIA  never had a clear recollection of her journey back to Sea Garden or of the next few days . She did not remember that she talked at all about what she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talker , and now she seemed to have been stricken almost dumb . She went about quietly , ate what they set in front of her , lived somehow . Vivian asked if she did not want a cot moved into her bedroom so she could have Marietta with her at night . Celia shook her head . She slept in snatches , and when she was tired of tossing in bed she would get up and sit by a window , where she could watch the patterns of moonlight or listen to the fall of sutniucr rain . She did not want anybody there , urging her to sleep when she could not sleep . But the nights were long and cruel . She would dream about the awfulness at Bellwood and wake up shaking with sobs . Or she would dream about Jimmy , and wake up to the black knowledge that Jimmy was dead . She thought ytvbat fools they had been to let that prig of a parson keep them apart . Suppose he did refuse to say the holy words till after she came of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had something to remember . The first thing she noticed  --  she did not recall how many days had passed before she noticed it  --  was that neither Miles norp218Amos was anywhere to be seen . She could not remember anything about Miles since the moment when he had snatched out his pistol in half-blind fury and shot Rosco . She had thought he was going to shoot himself , and had wondered why Lewis had sprung forward to stop him , since after what he had heard Miles must be already dead inside . She thought of this one morning when she came out on the piazza and saw Madge cutting a bouquet of sweet peas . Celia went out and asked her what had become of Miles . Madge was too wise to be evasive . She said that after Miles had fired the shot he stood there staring at the smoking pistol . Then all of a sudden , like a man pursued by things nobody else could sec , he turned and plunged into the woods . Just as suddenly , Amos and Big Buck went after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them go . Among the Negroes carried off by Tarleton had been the people Amos and Big Buck loved best . They and Miles would understand one another now . Celia pulled a handful of sweet peas from the trellis and walked away , tearing them to pieces and letting the petals scatter on the ground . She wished she could go into the woods too , and hide , like a sick animal . That afternoon Godfrey and Ida rode in . They had not heard of the holocaust at Bellwood , but when Lewis told them about it they exchanged meaningful glances , and Godfrey commented harshly , " So , that butcher meant just what he said . " Celia , sitting on the piazza , heard these words through a window . The others asked Godfrey what he meant , and he said , " You have n't heard about Colonel Sumter ? " At this , Celia came in . Vivian held out her hand , and Celia sat on the floor by Vivian 's chair . Vivian did not forbid her to listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go on , Godfrey , " Vivian said . Godfrey said that since the home of Ida 's family was near a main crossing of the Santee , they had frequent visitors . While there , Godfrey had heard a lot of news . I le said that after revoking the paroles Clinton had taken ship for New York , leaving Cornwallis in command of the king 's men in the south . When he had set up a supply post at Camdenp219in the northern part of South Carolina , Cornwallis sent Tarleton out to get equipment and Tory recruits . He told him also to clear up any " nests of treason " he might find . This Major Tarleton was twenty-six years old . He came of a well-to-do family in Liverpool , but already before the start of the American war he had run through the fortune his father had left him . When the war began he decided to enter the army , that refuge of debt-ridden aristocrats . His mother bought him a commission . Tarleton set out for New York , announcing that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any other hero of his majesty 's troops . So far his success in both his aims had been so great that he was generally referred to as Beast , or Butcher , or Barbarian , or uglier words . His own first name was Banastre , which nobody could pronounce anyway , and Americans said the other names were more fitting . Colonel Thomas Sumter was an officer of Continental troops . He had taken part in the battle of Fort Moultrie in 1776 , but in the quiet years following that victory he had retired to his plantation . He had not aided in the defense of Charleston because he had been prostrated by tragedies of his own . Father of a large family , he had in the space of a few weeks seen an epidemic kill all his children but one small boy ; and about the same time his wife was stricken with paralysis and left unable to walk . Sumter had hardly known when the British attacked Charleston , or cared . But when he learned that the city was taken he roused himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of a niece and the family servants , Sumter rode off to organize rebel troops in North Carolina . Tarleton had hoped to catch up with him . But failing in this , he destroyed Sumter 's plantation with the same terrible thoroughnesshe had used a few days later at Bellwood . Sumter 's little son scrambled up a tree , where he clung out of sight and watched the havoc . But Mrs. Sumter , in her chair in a room upstairs , could not move . Tarleton ordered the house set afire . Busy supervising the destructionoutside , he paid no attention to Mrs. Sumter 's screams . But two of his men , more decent than their leader , made theirp220way back into the burning house and carried her out before the walls fell in . They left her there among the ruins of her home , and as they rode away Tarleton spread the word that this was how he intended dealing with any other traitors who continued to fight their lawful king . As Godfrey told his story Celia sat where she was , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying . She felt tortured with a helpless hate . Godfrey urged Herbert and Vivian not to stay any longer at Sea Garden . Ile begged them to come to Charleston with him . But all that evening , all the next day , Herbert and Vivian said no . Herbert said , " We have no big fields , no army of Negroes to be carried off . We 're not worth the trouble of a raid . " Vivian said , " Our schooner is in the boathouse . If we get scared we can come to Charleston any time . " At last , the afternoon of the second day , they said they were tired arguing and wanted to rest . Herbert went to his library , Vivian started for her bedroom . As she stood up , Godfrey made one more exasperated effort . " Mother , I know it 's because of Luke that you want to stay here . But what good are you doing ? " Vivian smiled serenely . " Godfrey dear , would n't you just love to know ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipped out and spoke to Vivian in the hall . " Please , may I say something ? I wo n't take long . " " Come in here , " said Vivian . She opened the door of the room where she kept her household records , and sat down by the desk . Celia stood before the desk , twisting her hands . " What 's the trouble ? " Vivian asked . How calm she was , how sure of herself . How Celia envied her . Celia herself was as tense as a fiddle-string . She spoke in jerks . " Vivian you 're going to stay here all summer ? " " Why yes , " said Vivian , like any lady asked about her summer plans . " Why ? " " Then , " Celia said " then may I stay too ? " She stopped , wet her lips , made herself go on . " You see it was n't until just nowp221when they begged you to leave Sea Garden  --  that I realized I have n't anywhere to go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to say . Crying for shelter like a stray cat . Vivian smiled a little . " Why yes , Celia , you can stay here . " " I wo n't stay forever ! " Celia promised hastily . " I 'll go somewhereI 'll do something . But right now  --  I 'm all mixed up . " Vivian was looking straight at her . " You 'll have to make your own life , Celia , " she said . " We all do . Nobody can help us much . " Vivian must know what she was talking about . She had lived deeply , had had experience of loss . Celia blurted , " Vivian , you  --  so many  --  what do you do ? " " You live through it , Celia , " said Vivian . Her voice was firm . " You find out  --  and sometimes it 's very surprising  --  that no matterwhat you lose , there 's always something else . Life can still be good . " Celia stood with her hands still clenched , angry with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " oh , it was easy for Vivian to say that . Her world was full of blessings  --  riches and high posistion and so many people who loved her . Vivian could not know what it meant to be alone , and desolate . Celia brought herself back to her purpose . " Thank you for letting me stay . But I do n't want to be a burden . Have n't you some work I can do ? " " Plenty , " Vivian answered tersely . She opened a drawer . Expectinga sewing-basket , Celia was surprised to see her take out shears and garden gloves . " The flowers need looking after , " said Vivian . " You can start in the morning . " Later Celia thought , whatever Vivian does it 's not what you expect her to do . But somehow it 's usually right . The Bernards and the Penfields left for Charleston . As Burton and his family had left already , there was nobody at Sea Garden now but Herbert and Vivian and Celia , and about twenty Negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost like old times . Celia 's work began as soon as she had had breakfast . Directed by Vivian , she raked and spaded , pulled up weeds and trimmed the bushes , thinned the spring bulbs and put in new ones forp222autumn blooming . By the time she stopped to get ready for dinnershe was dirty and aching and dripping with sweat . But when she came to table she was hungry , and at night her muscles relaxed , so that she went to sleep with peace in her body even if it had not yet reached her heart . There were still times when she dreamed of Bellwood and woke up shuddering , and other times when she lay awake wonderingwhat was going to become of her . One night she woke to such hot stillness that she could hardly breathe . When she went to the window she could not feel a stirring of wind . Outside , the trees looked weird in the faint greenish glow of the moon . The long gray moss hung motionless . Celia could hear the croaking of frogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The air was like a burden . Wide awake and restless , she thought it might ease her nerves if she walked around . She was not in the habit of roaming about the house at night , but it would not matterif she would make no sound . Opening the door carefully she went into the hall . Through a front window came the glow of the moon . It did not give much light , just that greenish radiance , ghostly on the long gray moss and ghostly here as it threw the shadows of the windowpanes in rectangles on the floor . How quiet it was , how lonesome . This was a house built for a large family and many guests , but now there was nobody on the second floor but herself . On a front corner was the master suite of rooms . Herbert and Vivian used to have these for their own , but in late years , since they had found it tiresome to climb stairs , they had changed to rooms on the first floor . The servants slept in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed doors along the hall , and the empty rooms behind them , seemed grim , unfriendly . Celia went to the railing of the staircase and looked down . The stair-well was black . Below her , on the landing halfway down , she could hear the deep slow ticks of the great clock . She thought of how they had raised their glasses New Year 's Eve , and howJimmy had given her that gay loving smile as he whispered " Happy New Year ! "  |p223How  loud the clock sounded in the silent house . The slow tick-tocks seemed to draw her downstairs , toward the ballroom . She gathered her robe around her and felt her way down the stairs , guiding herself with a hand on the rail . The lower hall was dark but not completely black . Over the front door were panes of heavy glass , through which the moon shone dimly . As Celia paused at the foot of the stairs to see her way , above her the clock gave a low stern whirr . It was about to strike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her eyes . The clock struck two . Moving soundlessly , she made her way toward the ballroom . In these days the ballroom looked very little like the gorgeous place where they had danced last New Year 's Eve . With no prospect of entertaining company any time soon , Vivian had protectedthe floor with heavy canvas , and had moved in some pieces of furniture that she wanted out of the way for the summer . Celia stood a moment on the threshold . The curtains were closed . At the front windows she could see a shimmer of moonlight around the edges . The furniture , shrouded in dust-covers , looked like lumps of thicker darkness in the dark . She went inside . The place had the musty smell of a room little used . Moving along the wall , she put out her hand and found the marble mantelpiece . The hard cold feel of it was refreshing on her damp skin . She thought of the room as it had been that night , the candles glancing back and forth from the mirrors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swish of silk . And how happy she had been . Over by a corner window was a black lump that might be a chair . She went toward it , and held back the window-curtain long enough to see . The window was locked top and bottom , and had a heavy oak beam across it . At night every window in the house was locked except those of the occupied bedrooms ; Herbert went around to make sure of it , and the locks were of a complex design . It would do nobody any good to break a pane and reach in from outside . Under the dust-cover was a deep cushioned chair such as Herbertliked to draw up by the fire in winter , but for which he hadp224no use in sticky weather like this . Celia let the curtain fall , and curled up in the chair . Right over there on the wall , so near that she could almost have touched it , was the mirror where she had seen herself when she stood by the punch-table thinking , I 'm not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl who feels beautiful . She did not know how long she sat there , remembering , telling herself she ought to go back to her room because the pain of remembering was so great , but staying here anyway , rememberingmore . Suddenly in the silence she heard a sound . She stiffened . Her skin prickled as she thought , Tarleton . But maybe she had not heard anything . Or maybe Herbert andVivian could not sleep either , and were up , moving around . Shehad n't heard anything and if she had it was n't important . She heard it again . Footsteps . Soft , careful footsteps . Somebody was in the house . It could not be Tarleton , or sneak-thieves  --  nobody could force a way into this house without a banging and battering that could be heard a mile . It was Herbert or Vivian , no doubt about it . But the steps did not come from the direction of the rooms occupied by Herbert and Vivian . They came from the back of the house and they were coming this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she had heard the first sound , but it seemed an hour . With no conscious direction of her own her head had turned toward the door , but otherwise she had not moved . She could not . She sat deep in the chair , tense with fright . Somebody was standing in the doorway . A man  --  she could barely make out his figure in the dark . As she had done , he stood a moment on the threshold to get his eyes adjusted to what glimmerof light there was , then with the sureness of a man who knew his way around , he went to the nearest window . His footstepswere almost soundless on the covered floor . He moved the curtains a little way apart . Through the window came a faint light . The light was so dim , and Celia so frightened , that it took her an instant to recognize Luke . Luke wore neither hat nor coat , and the moon shone around the hard lines of his body . He turned from the window andp225started back toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have clumped noisily if the floor had been bare . So it was to protect Luke , and not the dance-floor , that Vivian had laid that canvas . Celia had nearly exclaimed when she saw him , and almost instinctivelyshe had pressed her fist over her mouth . Luke was a fugitive , maybe even now he was being pursued . If she spoke and startled him she might betray him . She sat still , barely breathing . Luke was at the doorway . In a low voice he said , " Come in , sir . You can see your way now . " He stepped aside . His voice , his manner , his every movement , showed a deep deference . Celia stared through the dark . Somebodyimportant was about to come in . Two men came through the doorway . One of them was a Negro , and leaning on his arm was a white man , smaller in build , who walked with a bad limp . With the colored man 's aid , the little cripple took a few haltingsteps toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not make out the words , she could tell that Luke was still addressing the lame man with the greatest respect . Luke walked toward the fireplace . Against the dark wood paneling of the wall by the mantel , Celia could barely make out his figure . He said , " Ready , Colonel Marion . " Marion ! Celia felt a shock . She had thought Marion would be a personage . Not a shriveled-up shrimp . He might improve when he could walk  --  that fall last March must have been a had one , since he was still limping in midsummer  --  but even standing up straight he would not look as if he amounted to much . Supported by the Negro , Marion hobbled toward the fireplace . Then , while Luke stood there , Marion and the colored man went through the wall . Celia felt pins and needles in her hair . There was no door next to the fireplace . On both sides there was that dark wood paneling , against which the white marble stood out in beautiful contrast . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke stood there alone . Now as he turnedp226around she could see that the wall was still there  --  she saw a faint reflection of moonlight on the paneling . Luke had started again toward the door . In her amazement Celia forgot her caution . She said , " Luke ! " He wheeled on one foot and stared around . She had stood up , and he saw her , a white figure in the dark . She said , " It 's me  --  Celia . " " Oh , " said Luke , and coming quickly toward her he caught her hand in his . His hand was rough and hard , and felt enormously strong . " What are you doing here ? " he demanded . " Why , nothing , " she returned . " I could n't sleep . Luke , where did Colonel Marion go just now ? " Luke 's hand closed on hers . She felt that he could have snapped her fingers like toothpicks . When he spoke his voice was low but it had a force like cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " except once when he fell out of a window on Tradd Street . " " Oh , all right ! " Celia retorted . " What do you think I am , a Tory spy ? I wo n't say anything if I should run into Cornwallis , or Tarleton  --  Tarleton  --  " Her voice cracked . With her free hand she covered her eyes . " I 'm sorry , Luke . But I 'm so torn up . Maybe you have n't heard  --  " Her throat closed and she could say no more . " Yes I have , " said Luke . He was suddenly very gentle . His grip on her hand relaxed . He drew her to sit again in the big chair , and he sat on the chair-arm beside her . Celia spoke again . " I did n't mean to cry . I thought I was through with crying . I 'm all right now . " Luke stroked her hair softly . " Celia , Jimmy is in God 's hands . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you . " There was a pause . In the close dusty air Luke had a smell of the woods about him , redolent of earth and leaves and grass , what she had always thought of as a " green smell . " Celia turned in the chair so she could speak to him directly . " Luke , " she said , " I did n't see anybody tonight . Not you , not anybody . I wo n't tell . " " I know you wo n't , " he said . Again there was a silence . Celia liked sitting here with him.  |p227After  a while she ventured , " Luke  --  Colonel Marion  --  " She hesitated . " What about him ? " " He 's very important , is n't he ? " " He sure is , " said Luke . Celia could not see the expression of Luke 's face , but she could hear the smile in his voice . " I guess , " added Luke , " Colonel Marion 's about the most important man within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he 's so puny ! " Luke laughed softly in the dark . " Honeychild , " he said to her , " when that man 's leading a charge , he looks nine feet tall . " She supposed he was right . The men who had served with Marion all seemed to think of him that way . Luke went on , " The British are combing the country for him . As long as he 's at liberty we 're not licked and they know it . He has to slip around like a puff of smoke . Always moving . " " Who 's the colored man ? " she asked . " That 's Buddy . His name is Oscar , but Colonel Marion calls him Buddy so the rest of us do too . They grew up together . " Like Jimmy and Amos , thought Celia , and the memory gave her a twinge of pain . She was glad when Luke spoke again . " Celia , how long have you been sitting here ? How much have you heard ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , but when she said their footsteps had approached from the back he said , " That 's right . Good ears . Mother always leaves Inc something to eat  --  I wo n't say where  --  so whenever I 'm in the neighborhood I can creep in and get a meal . " " Do you want me to call Vivian ? " she asked . " No . I 've left her a message . And I 'll be grateful if you do n't tell her you 've seen me . It might worry her that I did n't have sense enough to explore this room before I let Colonel Marion come in . " " I wo n't tell , " Celia said again . But she wondered how long he could go on like this , he and Marion and their friends . Hiding , whispering , moving by night like spooks.  | " Luke , tell me really , " she begged , " is there any chance for the rebels now ? " " Yes , plenty , " said Luke . He spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . But this much I can : there 's a rumor  --  I do n't know if it 's a fact , we 're trying now to find out  --  there 's a rumor that General Washington has sent us a force from his main army . They 're supposed to be on their way . " Celia could almost feel hear heart leap . Luke went on . " If it 's true , of course Colonel Marion will offer his services to the officer in command . So will I. I 'm tired of running . " Celia thought what it would mean to know the British were gone , the country safe from more horrors like Bellwood . With a hopeful sigh she leaned back . Her head brushed Luke 's arm , which lay across the back of the chair , and she felt him wince . She sat forward . " Are you hurt , Luke ? " " Scratched up a little . Moncks Corner , and another scrap at Lenud 's Ferry . Almost well now . Mother has been bandaging me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No doubt in that space behind the wall , whatever it was . But Luke was not going to talk about that and it was no use asking him . She thought of Marion 's lameness , and asked , " How are you gettingaround ?  --  he can hardly walk . " " Horses . Back in the woods . " " You still have Jerry ? " " Not since Moncks Corner . I shot him myself before we ducked into the swamp . No man of Tarleton 's was going to have Jerry . The governor gave me another . " She felt herself smiling as she asked , " And I suppose you gave him some crazy name out of the Bible ? " " Sure . His name is Bill . " " Bill ? There 's nobody in the Bible , " exclaimed Celia , " named William ! " Luke chuckled . " Bill , short for Bildad the Shuhite . " " Who ? " " Bildad . In the Book of Job . " Celia began to laugh . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she had laughed since Jimmy died . Luke stood up , saying he had to leave now . She stood up too . " I 'm glad I had a chance to talk to you , Luke , " she said . " It 's done me good . " " If that 's so , I 'm glad too . And I want to tell you one thing more . " Taking her hand in his again , he spoke with low-voiced assurance . " Celia , you have n't lost everything . You have plenty left . " She shook her head . " Like what , for instance ? " " Yourself , " said Luke . Again she shook her head . He went on , " Jimmy used to talk about you a lot . He was proud of you . He said you had gumption . " " I have n't got any gumption , " she said wearily . " If you had n't , " said Luke , " I do n't think Jimmy would have liked you . And if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you need is to use it . " His words had a bracing effect . " Thank you , Luke , " she said . " I 'll try . " " And now , " he said , " go upstairs , as softly as you came down . Go to your room . Do n't try to see me leave . " Celia promised . She went out , up the stairs , and into her room . She shut the door silently . In the closed room downstairs she had not noticed it , but here the air was fresher than it had been before . A breeze had started . Beyond the window the moss was swinging , the leaves were flutteringwith a sound like the clapping of little hands . Celia took a deep breath , and stretched , and yawned . She went hack to bed and to sleep . The next day was clear and windy . Celia worked the flowers , but all morning she looked for a chance to go into the ballroom . After a while , when Herbert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trowel into the earth and hurried in , to examine the wall by the fireplace . The paneling was oak , each panel about eight feet high and two feet wide and carved in a rectangular design . The structure was ingenious : every alternate panel stood out about an inch farther than the one on either side of it . Evidently one of thep230panels was made so it would slide across its neighbor , thus making a door . And this must lead to some exit from the house , letting Luke and Marion come and go in secret . How it was done she could not discover . But Vivian and Herbert were providing them with food , and maybe they were also acting as a center of information  --  Luke had said he had left a message . No wonder they had refused to go to Charleston . Celia pressed her lips together tight . There was not much she could do to help get rid of the redcoats , but she could keep her mouth shut . She went back to the flowers.  |p231THAT  AFTERNOON , Roy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in a rowboat with a maid and manservant , and two other Negroes who helped with the rowing . Roy announced their arrival in the usual way by ringing the bell at the boat-landing , and waited until Herbert and one of his men rode to the landing to see who the visitors might be . Gracious and charming , Roy begged that Mr. Lacy would forgivethe trouble he was causing . Nothing but necessity would have made him intrude this way . But Sophie was expecting a baby , and she needed special consideration . Roy explained that he had been serving as clerk and guide to a British officer , Major Edmore . They had been in Charleston , hut recently Major Edmore had been put in command of a force . that was now on its way by ship to a post on the north bank of the Santee . As Roy had to go along , he had obtained permission forSophie to go too . They had started early this morning and had hoped to finish their journey by dark . But the British sailors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as they expected , and now they had been forced to tie up for the night . Sophie and her maid were the only women on board , and the ship had no place fit for them to sleep . So , as they had tied up in the mouth of thep232little stream that led to Sea Garden , Roy had borrowed one of the ship 's boats , hoping the Lacys would be kind enough to give his party a night 's lodging . His request could hardly be refused . Herbert ordered that a cart be brought to carry Mr. and Mrs. Garth and their servants to the house . When she heard the names of the guests Celia fled to her room . But she had not been there long when she heard a knock , and Vivian came in . Closing the door behind her Vivian said , " I expect you to come to supper , Celia . " Celia shook her head . " You 're going to have to get used to facing people , " said Vivian . " You might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last night she had learned that Sea Garden was a refuge for Francis Marion . Roy was a Tory fawning for British favors . Vivian must be terrified , but she gave no sign of it . Celia thought , She does n't know I know about Marion . Maybe that 's better . We have to put on a brave front for each other . " Did you , " she began  --  " did anybody tell Roy about  --  Jimmy ? " " No details , " Vivian said kindly . " I suppose our servants will tell his , but I hope Roy and Sophie do n't hear it until they 've left . " She went on to explain . Learning that Celia was a guest of the Lacys , Roy had asked assiduously about her welfare . Herbert had told him briefly that her fiance had been killed in the war . Roy had said he was sorry to hear it . " I bet he 's sorry , " Celia snapped . " He 's sorry he 's lost a chance to get a connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to  --  " " Yes , " said Vivian . Celia thought of what Luke had said last night about Marion . Right now , Vivian too had an air of being nine feet tall . A little later Marietta came to call her to supper . Marietta said , " Your kinfolks sure are nice , Miss Celia . Mr. Roy , he said he was sorry to be making extra trouble , and he slipped all the house-folk silver money . " She held out her hand to show an English shilling . It had been a long time since Celia had seen one , and she felt angry to seep233it now and be reminded that American dollars were no good any more . But the evening was easier than she had expected . Roy was , as Herbert had described him , gracious and charming . Sophie , though her figure was clumsy , had as pretty a face as ever and was evidently doing her best to be agreeable . When Celia came downstairs they gave her a few words of sympathy about her loss , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Vivian had not fancied up her supper . The table was attractive , with its fresh cloth and bowl of flowers , but no more so than usual ; and the meal was what Vivian had planned to serve , cold meats and hot cornbread , pitchers of buttermilk and platters of summer fruit . Vivian asked Sophie what it was like in Charleston now . Sophie said it was very gay . There were so many British officersin town , and delightful men they were . Some of them were sons of noblemen , Sophie exclaimed with joyful awe . Everybody was having picnics , dinners , balls  --  in fact , there were so many entertainments , and so many extra men , that some girls went to several parties every evening , staying just long enough at each for a dance or two . Listening , Celia felt sick . That brave defense forgotten . The defenders locked up on prison-ships while the girls danced with the enemies . The whole town gone Tory . Everybody licking the boots of the conquerors . She wondered how Herbert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prison-ship in Charleston harbor . ( ; lancing at him , she saw only a courteous host attending to the wants of his guests . She marveled at his self-possession and Vivian 's , and did her best to seem as poised as they were . But she was glad she had never been a chatterbox , so if she could not talk now they would think nothing of it . Roy and Sophie seemed to be enjoying their supper . Roy was just asking Herbert if these delicious figs and peaches came from his own trees . Herbert said yes , and went on to ask Roy more about how things were in Charleston . Roy said the town had never been more prosperous . Any manp234who wanted a job could get one at good pay . The stores were open and you could buy anything you wanted . When the British came in , a number of British wholesale merchants had come too , bringing every sort of goods , which they had sold to Charleston storekeepers . Sophie said that after the half-empty stores of wartime it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . While they were in Charleston she had had some lovely clothes made for her expectedbaby . At Mrs. Thorley 's , of course . Oh yes , Mrs. Thorley'sshop was open and everybody was so glad of it . Celia felt a pinch at her heart . Last summer it had been Audrey who ordered baby-clothes from Mrs. Thorley 's . When they finished supper Herbert asked Roy if he would care for a glass of brandy . Celia went with Vivian and Sophie into the parlor . The summer sun was a long time setting . Sophie chattered , telling Vivian how grateful she was for this hospitality . " You 've given us a beautiful room , " she exclaimed . Vivian replied that she hoped they would be comfortable . It was a shock , she knew , to be unexpectedly benighted on a journey . " It 's really Roy 's fault , " Sophie said with a giggle . " He told Major Edmore we could make the whole trip in a day , and he should have known better . I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some provision for spending the night on board . But you know how men are , they wo n't take advice from a woman . So now we have to inconvenience you . " Vivian assured her that it was no inconvenience . They had plenty of room , and they enjoyed hearing the news from Charleston . With the skill of a practiced hostess she encouraged Sophie to go on talking . Celia did her best to keep her face blank , but her thoughts were almost shouting . Roy meant to get delayed here . What does he want ? Roy and Herbert came in . Roy asked if he might take Sophie for a stroll . She needed regular walks and she had had no chance for one today.  |p235They  went out . A moment later they could be seen in the sunsetafterglow , sauntering under the trees . Herbert took the place Sophie had left . There was a brief silence . Now that Herbert and Vivian were letting themselves relax , both their faces showed lines of strain . Celia spoke abruptly . " Vivian  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Herbert glanced questioningly at Vivian , who told him , " You were right . Sophie is too simple-minded to guess it , but it looks as if Roy got stranded here on purpose . " " You were right ? " Celia repeated . " How did you know ? " " Well , it is a long trip , too long for one day , " Herbert returned , " and also  --  " he smiled shrewdly  --  " dear child , no honest man needs to be that charming . " Vivian had dropped her head on her hand . Celia thought a lesser woman would have been having hysterics about now . She herself could guess how important the secrecy about Luke and Marion must be , since Vivian had not taken even Godfrey into her confidence . And they could not have gone very far since last night . The dusk was gathering . Roy and Sophie came indoors , and to Celia 's relief Roy said that as they had to start early in the morning they would go early to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she opened her bedroom door carefully . The hall was even darker than it had been last night , for the moon had not yet risen . Vivian had given Roy and Sophie a room across the hall . Under their door Celia could see a line of light . While she watched , the light disappeared . She waited and waited . Everything was quiet . They must have gone to bed and to sleep . At last she went back into her room , leaving the door ajar so she could hear if Roy started spooking around outside . She lay down in bed , but she did not feel sleepy . All of a sudden it was morning . Celia blinked , and raised herself on her elbow . She had been so certain she was going to stay awake , at least until the small hours after midnight . But after herp236long wakefulness of the night before she had been more tired than she had realized . Her door still stood ajar as she had left it . Maybe Roy had not stirred from his room in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was what had waked her . It was early , the sun just appearing , but Roy was making ready to leave . She heard him in the hall , telling Sophie 's maid to carry something , and his manservant to carry something else . Celia sprang out of bed and hurried to get dressed . She wanted to see them go . As he had been yesterday , Roy was smooth and charming . Sophie prattled  --  she was so very grateful , they must come to see her sometime , Where on earth had she put her scarf , dear dear she hardly knew what she was doing , she was n't used to being up at this hour and she was only half awake . Vivian said she quite understood , she was n't used to being up so early either . Vivian was calm as always , but she did not look well . Her face was drawn , and there were shadows under her eyes . Celia guessed that she had spent last night guarding that secret entrance to the ballroom . Roy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing . Herbert rode alongside on horseback , and the driver brought the cart back alone , saying Mr. Lacy had gone for a ride . Vivian went to her room . Celia set about working the flowers . She thought Vivian was catching up on her sleep , but when the first sound of hoofs told her Herbert was returning , Vivian came hurrying across the porch . She fairly ran to meet him as he dismounted . " The ship is gone , " said Herbert . " They 're aboard . " Vivian let out a sigh of relief that was like a sob . " You 're sure ? " " Sure . It 's an ordinary small troopship . Headed north toward the Santee , just as he said . " Vivian pressed her hands to her temples . Celia was pretty sure she was pressing a wild headache between them . Dropping her garden shears Celia hurried to where Vivian and Herbert stood . " Can I help ? " she asked . " Yes , " said Herbert . " Go make her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't hurt her a bit . " Celia ran to obey . It was good to do something . But how much longer , she wondered , could they keep this up ? And what ,  |p237oh  what did Roy want here ? Oh General Washington , please send that army ! He was sending it  --  early in August Darren brought news that he had , in fact , sent it . The troops were now crossing North Carolina , and Darren was on his way to join them . Darren rode up to Sea Garden on an afternoon of pouring rain . Tired , hungry , drenched with mud , mounted on a skinny little mare , Darren was nevertheless in his usually happy frame of mind . He told them it was a hard matter these days to get out of Charleston . When Cornwallis heard the Americans were coming , he had locked up the town . Nobody could leave without a pass signed by Colonel Balfour , city commandant . No shipcaptaincould take out anybody but the crew he had brought with him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , since people must eat , passes had to be given to fishermen and to farmers driving produce wagons . Darren had slipped out in a wagon on its way back home , hidden under the sacking that the driver had laid over his fruit-baskets that morning to keep off flies . Darren had chosen a steamy day of clouds and mosquitoes , when the guards in their woolen uniforms were so miserable that they were nearly out of their minds , and not too careful about inspecting . Once past the guards , the driver was enriched with money supplied by Godfrey , and Darren went looking for a horse . Darren told them Godfrey was eager to aid the new army , but it was not so simple for Godfrey to get out of town as for an obscure fellow like himself . Godfrey and Ida had two British officers billeted in their home , and his absence from the dinnertablewould be noticed at once . They would probably find him and bring him back before he had even tried to pass the guards . However , said Darren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the men quartered in private homes were behaving like pigs . But others were gentlemen , and the Bernards had two of these . Celia heard this unwillingly . She did not want to hear anything good about any man on the same side as Tarleton.  | " What about Tarleton ? " she asked . Darren gave a shrug . Tarleton , he said , was behaving just as might be expected . He had established himself in the home of a woman whose husband was a prisoner of war . Tarleton had made his hostess and her children  --  four children , of both sexes  --  all eat and sleep in one room , while he used the rest of the house to give parties for his officer friends and an assortment of harlots . When the poor woman pleaded that she be allowed to use two rooms , if only for the sake of decency , Tarleton replied that rebels deserved no consideration . It had been a matter of great pleasure to the patriots of Charleston when Tarleton came down with malaria . Unfortunately he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was miserable for a few weeks . Darren spent the night at Sea Garden and left the next day . After this , for three weeks they heard nothing at all . Wretched weeks they were , hot and full of rain . The creeks overflowed , the woodland turned to a bog . They might as well have been in prison . Neither friends nor enemies could reach them . Vivian told Celia that Luke and Marion , with some others , had gone to join the army , and Celia , remembering Luke 's request , did not say she had heard this already . They did not know how many men Marion had with him , but they did know the men were ready to fight like fiends . But this was all they knew . Herbert sought refuge in his books . Vivian read too , and played the spinet by the hour . They both devised tasks to keep the servants busy , for the Negroes found it as hard as the white folks to bear this dragging isolation . Celia thought she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then , she begged for something else to do , and was glad when Vivian gave her the household mending . Day after day they prayed for the new army , and peered through the streaming windowpanesfor a messenger who might bring them news . At last the rain stopped . The sun appeared , and with it came a wind from the sea . On a bright morning at the end of August they heard the clang of the landing-bell . The folk at Sea Garden were so thirsty for news that they all , black and white , dropped whatever they were doing and ranp239toward the landing . Those who got there first stopped and stared . Those coming up behind , who could not see yet , heard a long deep groan of despair . They ran on , calling " What 's the news ? " But the folk on the landing had not needed to ask the news . They saw it . They saw a ramshackle rowboat , such a wretched thing that they wondered how it had made any journey at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the landing-bell an eighth . Their clothes were caked with blood , and every man of them had an arm or leg tied up with rags . It was Darren who had rung the bell . He had barely managed to ring it , because he had only one arm he could use . The other arm hung in a sling made of cloth torn from his shirt . Darren was saying thickly , " Please help us . " He leaned on the upright that held the bell , too tired to stand up any longer . There were a hundred questions , but all Darren could answer was , " This time it 's really over . " Herbert ordered the cart , and brought the men to the house . While he worked with the Negro horse-doctor , Vivian tore up cloth for bandages , and Celia helped the maids bring food and pitchers of milk . At last they got the men cared for . That afternoon , Darren told them the story . He said Washington had sent down a force of Maryland and Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many battles . There were no better fighters in the army . On their way they had been joined by militia from Virginia and North Carolina . Cornwallis was to be attacked by a first-class force . Congress had agreed with Washington when he chose this army from among his finest troops . But Congress had overruled his choice of a general . Washington wanted to send Nathanacl Greene , the fighting Quaker who had won distinction at the battles of Trenton and Brandywine , and even more distinction in the thankless job of quartermaster-general . But Congress said no . They gave the command to Horatio Gates . Gates was popularly called " the hero of Saratoga . " But Washingtonwas not the only military man who thought he did not deserve to be called a hero . True , the battle of Saratoga had beenp240a great American victory and Gates had been there . But the soldiers said Gates had merely been there . They said the victory had been won by other officers who did not have Gates ' talent for talking about themselves . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Jersey under the leadership of the Baron de Kalb , a brilliant German who had come to America early in the war to aid the rebels . De Kalb led them as far as North Carolina , where Gates joined them and took command . Here , too , Francis Marion and about twenty of his friends rode in . Luke was among them . Marion 's men did not look pretty . Fugitives in the swamps for months past , they had broken their shoes and torn their clothes , and they were gaunt from scanty fare . They had good horses , but the horses , too , were hungry . Half the men had no guns , and those who did had no powder or shot to put into them . Their leader did not look pretty either . In his months of eluding the British , slipping from swamp to cabin to plantation house , hiding under haystacks and horse-blankets , Marion 's broken ankle had had small chance to heal . He limped grotesquely . His own clothes had fallen apart , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too large , and a red coat somebody else had taken from a British soldier . He had neither comb nor razor , and no soap . Baron de Kalb welcomed him . General Gates did not . Gates had a self-assurance that amounted to self-worship . He had come to beat Cornwallis and he had no doubt that he was going to do it . He was not familiar with this part of the country , but that bothered him not at all . Marion had been born in the region now held by the British under Cornwallis . He knew the roads and rivers , the best places to get food , the temper of the people . He had come to tell Gates what he knew . Gates was not interested . As Marion was a fellow-officer of the Continental Army , Gates could not refuse to see him . But Gates had already made up his mind . Cornwallis was marching toward the British post at Camden . Gates had decided to go at once to meet him , give him a beating , and then march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a hurry . The men had already marched four hundred miles in summer heat . Marion advisedhim to let them rest , and to give the militia more training before he made them face the British regulars . Gates was bored . Choosing a bad road  --  and ignoring Marion and everybody else who told him there were better ones  --  he led his men through North Carolina , and made camp just about the South Carolina line . Here , by a stroke of luck , he had a chance to get rid of Marion . Into camp came a messenger from Kingstree . He brought word that the men of the Kingstree neighborhood were organizing to fight , and they wanted an experienced leader . They had sent him to ask for Marion . Fine , fine , said General Gates . Let Marion go right on and take charge of those men , and he had just the job for them . When he had won his victory  --  which he would do in a few days now  --  the British would naturally try to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers and destroy all the boats he could find . With the boats gone , the British could not get away . They would be rounded up and made prisoners . Marion did not say what he thought of this order . Gates was the commander and Marion had to obey . With his ragamuffin band Marion rode out of camp . Thus it came about that Marion was not present at the battle of Camden , where Gates led his troops into the worst defeat an American army had taken since the war began . Gates was so eager for his triumph that he would not wait to drill the militia . He would not wait to collect decent food supplies , nor even give his men time for proper cooking of the food they had . On the morning of the battle half his splendid veterans were so sick they could hardly stand . As for the militiamen , besidesbeing queasy with bellyaches , many of them had never been in battle before , and they were so ill-trained that when they met the British they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours . The men were cut to pieces , the ground strewn horribly with their dead and dying bodies . Those who lived to run away were chased for twenty miles by Tarleton and his cavalry.  |p242Baron  de Kalb fought until he fell with eleven wounds . He lived three days more , humanely tended by British surgeons under orders of Cornwallis , who knew a great soldier when he saw one , and gave him honor . As for Gates , he galloped away in blue panic . Mounted on a racehorse , he did not stop till he had gone seventy miles . As soon as he could find a fresh horse he started again , and he kept running until in three days he had gone two hundred miles from Camden . He never came back . " And now ? " asked Herbert . " God knows , " said Darren . The four of them  --  Herbert and Vivian , Darren and Celia  --  sat by a front window in the glow of late aftenoon . Two men who had come with Darren had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less severe , sat on the lawn planning how they were going to get home . Darren had fought with the militia . As they staggered away from Camden this chance group had found the ramshackle boat tied up at a landing not yet reached by Marion 's men . They took it and fled . In pain and nearly starved , sometimes they rowed , sometimes drifted , sometimes hid in the bushes while British horsemen galloped past . Often they saw smoke rising from some country house that was being looted and destroyed , for the British were dealing terrible punishment . Darren thought of Sea Garden , so out of the way that the redcoats had probably bypassed it . He led the others on , by crooked streams , through the pouring rain , till they got here . Darren leaned back in his chair , his left arm in a sling , his handsomeface sunken with weariness . He added that he might as well tell them all the bad news  --  here was a bit brought by the Continentalsfrom Washington 's headquarters . Remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston ? Well , it had finally reached America . Heading for Charleston , the fleet met an outgoing ship which brought word that the British had already taken the city . The French commander turned north and put in at Newport , Rhode Island , to wait for orders . Three days later a British fleet reached Newport . Finding the French in thep243harbor the British had to anchor outside the entrance . So now there they were . The king 's men could not get in , the Frenchmen could not get out . The two fleets just sat there , making each other useless . Celia looked around at the others . Darren , though slumped with defeat , was saying he was lucky to have only a trivial wound . Vivian and Herbert , though sick at the story of Camden , were glad that Luke had gone with Marion and that Tom was a prisoner , so neither of them had been there . Everybody , thought Celia , has something to be happy about . Everybody but me . She remembered how glad she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . They could not have given her back Jimmy , but if they had chased out the British they would have given her a sense of being free again . But they had failed . She had nothing . She turned to Herbert . " Mr. Lacy , have we lost the war ? " Herbert spoke gravely . " Washington sent us the best he had . And pretty nearly all he had . " Celia did not want to hear any more . She left them and went to the side porch , out of sight of the soldiers on the lawn . In front of her she saw the gold and copper sky . The air was rich with the scent of honeysuckle , and she could hear birds chirping their evening songs . Such a beautiful world and such horrible things happened in it . She knew now what she had to do . She had to go back to work at Mrs. Thorley 's . Sophie had said the shop was open . There was plenty of trade , and Mrs. Thorley would be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no money but a few American bills , good for nothing now but to start the kitchen fire . How she dreaded going back . She could just imagine what it would be like with the other girls . Dutiful sympathy , and under it smirks of triumph . Oh , she thought she was going to marry a rich man . Yes , and once she got in with those people she forgot about her old friends . She did n't invite any sewing-girls to that ball New Year 's Eve . Well , it just goes to show you . Does n't do to put on airs too soon . But that would not be all . They would talk like this for a while , then they would find something else to smirk about . That would not last forever . But the job in the shop  --  that would last , and last ,  |p244and  last . She thought of Miss Loring and Miss Perry , old maids who were n't ever going to have any fun . Now she would be like them . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering , I hear that once she had a beau , but he died . They would giggle . You mean Miss Garth ? I do n't believe any man was ever in love with that scrawny fussbudget . And she would wither away . One of our old and valued employees . Oh Miss Loring , was it like this for you ?  |p245VIVtAN  APPROVED of Celia 's decision to go back to Charleston . " There 's no solace like work , " she said . Celia smiled politely , but she was not impressed . She envied Vivian , who was so rich she did not need to work . Herbert 's son Eugene rode over one day to sec how they were , and Vivian asked if he knew anybody who could take Celia to Charleston . Eugene said two neighbors of his , Mr. and Mrs. Kirby , were planning to go to town shortly . Eugene and Mr. Kirby were old friends , and still liked each other in spite of the fact that Mr. Kirby favored the king . Those Tories , Celia thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstance as unpleasant for her as possible . She envied Darren , who was a man and could ride to town by himself . She packed her belongings . There was one box that she had not opened since she went to Bellwood to be married . It held her emerald necklace and the bracelets of gold roses Jimmy had given her ; and also , folded in a covering of heavy muslin , the cravat she had made for him . The necklace she looked at sadly . Probably Roy really would get his hands on it now and give it to Sophie . She glanced at the bracelets , and quickly shut the case . If she ever saw Miles again she would give them hack . They were family treasures and she was not part of the family.  |p246But  when she foolishly opened the muslin covering and saw the cravat , and remembered how many hours of her life she had put into it and what happy hours they had been  --  then it was as if an animal was clawing into her bosom and tearing her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripped it to pieces . As she yanked at the cloth it seemed to her that in destroying her beautiful creation she was also destroying her girlhood and her young dreams . She took the shreds out to the kitchen and burned them in the cook-fire . Before she left she gave the rabbit 's foot to Marietta . " Keep it for Amos , " she said , " to remember Mr. Jimmy by . " Marietta wrapped the silver chain around the rabbit 's foot and put it into her pocket . When she looked up there were tears in her eyes . " Miss Celia , if you should hear anything about Amos  --  " " Yes , of course , " Celia promised . " I 'll get word to you . " She envied Marietta , who still had somebody to live for . Eugene sent a note to Mr. Kirby , who wrote back that their schooner would stop for Miss Garth on the way to town . When they came to Sea Garden they made only a brief pause , and Mr. Kirby avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her green eyes and red hair , chattered about her clothes and her children . She now had two children , her little boy George , named for the king , and her new baby Freddie . She explained that Freddie also was named for the king , as " George William Frederick " was the full name of George the Third . Herbert told Celia goodby with grave pleasantness , and gave her a volume of Shakespeare 's comedies to amuse her leisure . Vivian said , " I 've handed Mr. Kirby a note for Burton . You can stay with Burton and Elise until you 're established at Mrs. Thorley 's . Goodby , dear . " On the boat , Celia spent her time helping Mrs. Kirby 's maids wait on her . Mrs. Kirby was not a deliberate snob ; it merely would not have occurred to her that a working girl had any mission in life but to wait on her betters . At the Charleston wharf two redcoats came on board and asked Mr. Kirby to identify himself . Mr. Kirby showed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plantation was located . This certified that Mr. and Mrs. Kirby were loyal subjects who during the late insurrection had given aid and comfort to his majesty 's troops and who had permission to return to their town house . One of the redcoats scribbled a paper allowing them to land . The harbor was busy with British ships . Ahead of her Celia saw Charleston , glowing like an opal in the evening sun . It would have been beautiful except for the black steeple of St. Michael 's with the white scar where the shell had struck . They went in a hired coach to the Kirbys ' home on Broad Street . Before dark Burton called for Celia , and they walked to Vivian 's house on Meeting Street . He told her his own house had been damaged by the firing , and so far  --  ahem , he cleared his throat  --  he had not been able to manage the repairs . She noticed that Burton still wore clothes too tight for him . Evidently he was not as prosperous as he used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British flags and hundreds of men in red coats . I 'll have to get used to it , she told herself . At the corner of Broad and Meeting Streets they passed the statue of William Pitt , with his left arm gone and the broken place at his shoulder like an open wound . Elise told her it was so nice to see her again and she did hope Celia would n't mind sleeping in a little room on the third floor . It was all they had empty . The boys were with them , and also two officers were billeted here . British , yes , but really quite nice . The officers had gone to a party this evening . Really it was lucky that they were staying here , because Burton had not taken the oath of allegiance to the king , Godfrey had but not Burton , and sometimes things were made quite unpleasant for men who had not taken the oath . But with two officers in the house things were so much simpler . The maid would show Celia to her room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly ready . Celia was washing up when suddenly she stopped , the cake of soap between her hands . Elise had said Godfrey had taken an oath of allegiance to the king . Celia thought of Godfrey 's patriotismduring the siege . But now he had given in . And from thep248way Elise spoke , probably a lot of other patriots had too . I 'll have to get used to it , Celia told herself again . The next morning she wrote to Mrs. Thorley , saying that her fiance had been killed in the war and she would like to come back to work . A servant of Burton 's took the note to the shop and brought back a reply . Mrs. Thorley said she was distressed by the news , but would be glad to have Celia 's services again . She asked Celia to call this afternoon . Godfrey and Ida had come in to sec her , and Godfrey said he would tell Darren to come over and walk with her to the shop . Not long after dinner a maid came to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried down . Darren was well dressed and looked as merry as ever , but as he crossed the room to meet her she noticed that he limped and carried a cane . When she asked why , he said he was still having a little trouble from the leg-wound he had received during the siege . " Oh ! " she said , surprised , for she had not noticed Darren limpingwhen she saw him at Sea Garden . " You mean the night you moved the  --  " " Shh ! " Darren said quickly . He beckoned her nearer , and gave her a smile of conspiracy as he whispered , " It 's still there . Walled up . No sense in telling them . " Celia smiled back . It was a pleasure to know there were ten thousand pounds of gunpowder in the Exchange , which the king 's soldiers would like to use to shoot rebels but which they had not found . It was even more of a pleasure to observe that Darren was still loyal to the patriot side . But her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " First we 'll go to the office on Queen Street so you can swear in as a British subject . " " What ? " she exclaimed . " Me ? " " Did n't they tell you ? " Celia shook her head . Darren made her sit down by him on the sofa . He told her that if you did not declare yourself a good subject of King George you could not hold a job or engage in business . He pushed aside the curtain so she could see carpenters repairing a house damaged during the siege . Those men might have principles , said Darren , but they had taken the king 's oath because without ap249paper in your pocket saying you had done this , you could not earn a living . " Have you done it ? " she asked shortly . " Oh yes . Everybody has , except a few men so rich they do n't need to work . " " Like Burton , " Celia said with astonished respect . So this was why he had not repaired his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding out . " Yes , " said Darren , but he added seriously , " I 'm afraid even men like him are going to have to give in . Colonel Balfour  --  the city commandant  --  arrested about forty rich men the other day and shipped them to the British fort at St. Augustine , because they had n't taken the oath . Since then every man who has n't taken it is afraid of being exiled , and a lot of them have been swearing in so they can stay with their families . " There was a silence . Celia wondered if he was trying to justify Godfrey . She thought Godfrey was rich enough to live without working , but she could not imagine his doing so . Activity was his life . She was amazed at Darren 's attitude . He had slipped out of town in a farm cart so he could fight for his country , and now he talked about taking the king 's oath as though it was like signinga receipt for goods . Maybe he did have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he might have shown some anger at the British for making him do it . Then she asked herself , Why am I finding fault with Darren ? He says I 've got to take the oath too . I suppose if I had a really noble character I 'd proudly refuse . Yes , and then what ? I ca n't ask Burton to support me , he 's got all he can do taking care of his family . And Godfrey , he 'd tell me to go ahead and take the oath same as he did . So what could I do ? Beg my bread from door to door and sleep in an alley and get arrested for vagrancy ? Well , I 'm not that noble . I 'll swear in . They 've killed Jimmy and wrecked Bellwood and ruined my life and now they 're making me kneel down and kiss their boots . Oh , I hate them for making me do it and I hate myself for doing it . Darren had limped to the door and was waiting for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " I 'll go with you . " A building on Queen Street had been partitioned into smallp250offices for the king 's troops . Darren showed Celia into a room where two bored-looking redcoats lounged at desks . Darren spoke to one of them , showed his own paper , and said that Miss Garth wanted to take the king 's protection and resume her former employment . The redcoat yawned , asked her name and age and wrote them in a ledger , yawned again , asked where she wanted to work , and wrote that too . Then he said , " Raise your right hand do you solemnly swear bumble bumble bumble bumblebumblebumble . " Celia put her left hand into her pocket and crossed her fingers , held up her right hand and answered " Yes . " The redcoat took a printed form out of a drawer , filled in the information she had given him , put on an official stamp , and handed her the paper . As she took it he rubbed his eyes sleepily and asked the other redcoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Thorley 's shop . Celia was shocked at the look of the town . The streets had been cleared , but at the corners were piles of bricks and broken glass and other trash , not even yet carried away though the siege was four months past . Some stores were open and doing good business , but others still had boards nailed across the doors and windows . Repairs on damaged buildings were makeshift : windowpaneshad been replaced by oiled paper or sheets of tin , chimneys mended with pieces of brick stuck unevenly together , woodwork painted badly or not at all . The whole place looked tired and sick . Just the way I feel , she thought . It was late afternoon , the fashionable hour for shopping and driving , and the streets were full of people . Here and there Celia saw redcoated soldiers on guard . Others , off duty , idled along the sidewalk or leaned on the walls , watching the people go past . They eyed her with such meaningful glances that she understood why Godfrey had sent Darren to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies and gentlemen . Several of these she recognized as customers of the shop , and she thought , Now I 'll be making their clothes and I 'm no better patriot than they are . At the shop she went to the side door , trying not to remember the gray Sunday afternoon when she and Jimmy had come to thisp251door together and he had kissed her in the little hallway . Darren said he would leave her now . He limped down the steps and away . Celia looked after him . It was really odd about that limp . She was sure he had not had it when she saw him at Sea Garden . In Mrs. Thorley 's office you would not have thought anything had happened . Mrs. Thorley sat at her desk , large , calm , starched . The room was in perfect order . The windows even had all their panes . Either this building had been mighty fortunate or Mrs. Thorley had managed to get some glass from somewhere ; knowingMrs . Thorley , Celia rather imagined it was the latter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty after a holiday . " Come in , Miss Garth . I hope you are well ? " " Yes , Mrs. Thorley , thank you . " Celia stood respectfully before the desk . It had seemed the same . But it was not the same . Mrs. Thorley was saying , " I trust you have taken the king 's protection , Miss Garth ? " Celia felt a twitch of shame as she answered , " Yes , Mrs. Thorley . " " May I see your paper , please ? " Celia handed it over . " This seems in order , " Mrs. Thorley said crisply , and returned it . She folded her large hands on the desk . " Take a chair , Miss Garth . " Celia sat down . She crossed her ankles and laced her fingers on her lap . It was like that other afternoon a year ago when Mrs. Thorley had summoned her to say she had received a letter from Mrs. Lacy . But again , it was different . This time the difference was in Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia realized that Mrs. Thorley no longer looked upon her as a beginner fit only for buttons and bastings , but as a dressmaker who knew her trade . Mrs. Thorley was actually asking her what sort of work she would like to do . She said there was now a plentiful supply of good materials , and they had more orders than they could fill  --  orders for dresses , andp252fancy caps and kerchiefs , and the delicate little gauze aprons so fashionable just now , and gentlemen 's fine shirts and sleeverufflesAnd as Mrs. Thorley talked , offering her the sort of work she had yearned for , Celia felt nothing at all . She remembered with wonder , almost with disbelief , how she used to enjoy working in the shop . She remembered how she had sent up prayers that Mrs. Thorley would keep her here , how she had schemed to prove that she was worth keeping . How she had dreamed of the day when they would give her the fine sewing she could do so well . And now she did not care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered a proverb . " When you get what you want , you do n't want it . " Mrs. Thorley was still talking. however , she said , last year Miss Garth had been very good at minding the parlor . Not every young lady could receive the visitors with just the right manner , gracious and yet distant . And at present , circumstances were perhaps more difficult than usual . Of course , in the parlor , with its frequent interruptions , Miss Garth would not be able to do the sort of work that required close attention . Mrs. Thorley asked Celia which she preferred . Celia did not hesitate . In the parlor something was happening all day long . She would have no time to sit and remember . She chose the parlor . Mrs. Thorley nodded gravely . She said Celia 's trunk had been brought over by a servant of Mr. Dale 's , and had been put into her old room . Miss Todd and Miss Duren were there , and Miss Kennedy was expected back . Mrs. Thorley made a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Garth . " Celia stood up . " Thank you , Mrs. Thorley . " She curtsied and went to the door . As she reached her hand toward the doorknob Mrs. Thorley said , " Miss Garth . " Celia turned toward her again . " Yes ma'am ? " Mrs. Thorley 's face was large and calm like the rest of her . She said , " You have my sympathy , Miss Garth . " " Thank you ma'am , " said Celia . She supposed people felt they had to say something , yet she wished they would not ; every word of commiseration was like a finger touching the wound . Mrs. Thorley 's deep voice was speaking again.  | " It is hard to lose the person one loves . " " Yes ma'am , " said Celia . She thought , Oh hush ! You 'll make me cry and I do n't want to cry any more . Mrs. Thorley said , " I remember well . " Her voice had softened strangely . " So many years , and sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched wide , but there were no tears in them ; she was gazing at Mrs. Thorley in astonishment . The woman meant what she said . Mrs. Thorley had been kissed often , and with love . Mrs. Thorley said , " I wish I could make it easier for you , Miss Garth . But I can not . I can only say again , you have my sympa-thy . " In a low voice Celia answered , " Thank you , Mrs. Thorley . " Somehow she knew those words had been hard for Mrs. Thorley to speak . Mrs. Thorley never showed any weakness . She could not afford to . For the first time it occurred to Celia that maybe Mrs. Thorley was not naturally made like a man-of-war , she had had to make herself that way . Celia spoke again . She said , " You have my sympathy too , Mrs. Thorley . I think you 're mighty brave . " Mrs. Thorley ran the tip of her tongue over her lips . Her hands moved a trifle . It struck Celia that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Celia thought she had better get out of here . She curtsied again , and Mrs. Thorley gave her a nod of dismissal . Celia went out , closing the door softly . She felt certain that they were not going to talk about this subject again . After this , she half expected Miss Loring to make sonic confidence , and maybe Miss Perry too . But they did not . They spoke brief words of sympathy and no more , and Celia never found out if either of them had ever had a lover . She reflected that they probably felt it was none of her business , and they were right . And so in those bright blue days of September , 178o , Celia went back to her job of minding the parlor . It was not quite the same job nor the same parlor . Charleston was a town held by troops . They were a conquering army , theyp254were a long way from home , and many of them considered that they were privileged to do exactly as they pleased . Mrs. Thorley had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wall there was now a balustrade nearly as high as Celia 's chest , standing between the front door and the doors that led into the rest of the building . In front of the balustrade  --  so as not to dismay her legitimate customers  --  Mrs. Thorley had placed attractive furniture : comfortable chairs , a table with a bowl of flowers , the cabinets with their tempting displays . But the balustrade itself was broad and sturdy , and to get past it you had to go through a gate that could be opened only from inside . Across this barrier , Celia greeted all visitors with a smile . But within call was always Miss Loring or one of the older seamstresses , who could provide , when necessary , an atmosphere of ice and vinegar . Celia never went to the front side of the gate during business hours . If someone wanted a closer look at a sample in one of the cabinets , she took a duplicate from a case on her side of the rail and handed it across . This custom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart-alecky British lieutenants had asked Miss Loring to show them samples of linen shirting . Miss Loring went around to open the cabinet indicated , and when she bent over the lock one of the smarties thought it a fine joke to pinch her skinny bottom . But there was not much of this sort of thing . Most of the redcoatswho came in were escorts of Tory ladies , and behaved well enough . They sat in front of the balustrade swapping stories , or they mopped their foreheads and complained about the weather , or asked Celia for the Gazette to pass the time . The newspaper these days was edited by a Tory , and he had changed its name to The Royal South Carolina Gazette . He printed official announcements , news of parties attended by British officers , and reports of great British victories in parts of the country where the king 's men were still fighting the troops of " Mr. " Washington . In the shop itself , life had not changed much . Mrs. Thorley still served milk . She still forbade discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned since the siege and new ones had replaced them , but this could have happened any time . The longerp255Agnes Kennedy stayed away the better Celia liked it . She was in no mood to put up with Agnes Kennedy 's sweet disposition , not now when she herself felt nothing but a black helpless hate . She hated Charleston and everybody in it . The city commandant , Lieutenant-Colonel Nisbet Balfour , was a fattish offensive man with a nasty reputation . People said of him that he had won his laurels while the British occupied Philadelphia . At that time Balfour had served as procurer of women for his commander , Sir William Howe , as well as for other leadersof the king 's troops . He did this duty so well that they promised him he would not be forgotten when the plums were passed around . So now Balfour was lord of Charleston . Under such a ruler , the town had lost its old decency . The streets were dirty . There were more taverns than ever before . Near the southeastern docks there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wartime shortage of materials much of the burnt area had not been rebuilt ; now this was a community of shacks where women both white and colored received the soldiers . Even the better parts of town swarmed with trollops . From her window on the third floor , Celia could look over Charleston and see what was going on . The Lutheran Church on Archdale Street , and the lovely little Unitarian Church next door , were both being used as stables . The White Meeting I Iouse , for which Meeting Street had been named , was now a storehouse for army supplies . Horses were trampling on the graves in the churchyards . They kicked at the tombstones , and cracked them or knocked them over , and the stones lay broken among the weeds . Celia heard that the British army chaplains had protested to Balfour about this desecration , but if they had , he paid no attention . St. Philip 's and St. Michael 's , as representing the established Church of England , had not been disturbed , but services were now conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to join in prayer for the king 's army , stayed home . Celia stayed home . Looking out of her high window on Sunday mornings , she was disgusted at how many people she saw going into the churches . She knew , she just knew , there had not been that many Tories in Charleston before the British marched in.  |p256But  this sight was not the only one that disgusted her . Day after day she felt nauseated as she watched people in Charleston , in spite of all that was being done to them , toadying to their conquerors . Of course there were some who had been on the king 's side all the time . The Kirbys , the Torrances  --  if they welcomed the British now you could not be surprised . But the Baxters were inviting redcoat officers to dinner , and so were dozens of other families who used to be patriots . Even Godfrey Bernard was meeting the British with smiles , Ida was dancing at their balls  --  when she thought of it , and remembered Bellwood , Celia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that nobody had any self-respect any more . Except maybe those men who had been sent to St. Augustine . There were others who had tried to hold out . But a messenger brought a proclamation from the headquarters of Cornwallis at Camden . Cornwallis said that certain wealthy persons in South Carolina were persisting in their treasonable efforts . He therefore ordered that if you had not sworn allegiance to the king , and still refused to do so , your property would be confiscated and turned over to somebody who deserved it . A loyal subject of the king named John Cruden was put in charge of the confiscation , with the title Commissioner of Sequestrated Estates . On the twenty-first of September , the Royal Gazette proudly published the names of one hundred and sixty-three men who had held to their principles as long as they could , but now had given in and taken the oath to save their property . The paper came while Celia was at dinner . When she returned to the parlor that afternoon she saw the announcement and the list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She threw the paper on her worktable and walked over to a side window , where she stood pretending to adjust the curtain . There were no customers in the parlor just now . Through the open window Celia could see redcoats walking and driving with well-dressed women whose husbands and fathers had taken the oath so they would not have to be poor . She heard a street-peddler calling that he had fine fresh grapes to sell . Everybody , she thought , has something to sell . And the Britishp257and Tories and bootlickers have money to buy it . So we 've quit . And I 'm no better than anybody else . I 'm working in a fashionableshop , smiling at the people who have money to spend , forgetting that I ever believed in anything . She felt sick with contempt , contempt for herself and for her country . Americans , she thought , are no good . We do n't deserve to be free.  |p258SHE  HEARD the front door open . As she turned she saw Mrs. Kirby , crisp and pretty in flowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on her pleasant professionalsmile and went to the balustrade . " How do you do , Mrs. Kirby . " Mrs. Kirby said how do you do , and did n't Celia think it was remarkable how Freddie had grown since they came to town , really he was so advanced that most people would n't believe he was only four months old , and today 's Gazette had carried an announcement by Mrs. Thorley that a shipment of striped and printed silks had arrived and she would like to see them only she did n't have much time because they were going to have supper tonight with Mr. Kirby 's parents and she had to get there early and arrange the flowers because Major Brace and Captain Woodleywere going to be there and her mother-in-law wanted everythingespecially nice and she did hope the silks were ready to be seen because if they were n't ready she just could n't wait . Smiling graciously , Celia said the silks were ready . Before she had finished her sentence Mrs. Kirby 's words were tumbling out again , this time addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freddie on over to his grandma 's . Mamma 's ' ittle precious wan na go to danma 's ? Mamma 's ' ittle precious bep259good ? Mamma 's ' ittle  --  " The door opened again and she broke off , " Why Emily , darling ! " The lady addressed as Emily was Mrs. Leon Torrance , wife of Sophie 's brother . The Torrances had just come to town from their plantation , and Celia had seen Mrs. Torrance only once before , last week when she came in to order a dress . A pretty brunette , wearing white lawn with red stitching and a hat with a red plume , today Mrs. Torrance was accompanied by two British officers . She introduced the officers to Mrs. Kirby , who showed off her baby while they murmured polite admiration . At length Mrs. Torrance said she simply must get upstairs for her fitting . The two officers , fanning themselves . with their hats , said they would go over to that new tea-shop on Cumberland Street . It was so near the waterfront , maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This weather was murderous . They bowed themselves out , promising to call for Mrs. Torrance in an hour . As the door closed , Mrs. Kirby looked after them petulantly . " They make me tired , always carrying on about the weather . Everybody knows any weather is better than what they get in England ! " " It 's not the weather , " said Mrs. Torrance , " it 's those heavy woolen uniforms . They say the men at Camden are miserable , with all the outdoor patrolling they  --  " " Oh for pity 's sake , " exclaimed Mrs. Kirby . " The supply officersare doing the best they can ! They 've got a shipment of lightweight clothes ready for Camden right now  --  1 know because my husband arranged the purchase  --  the wagons were held up because they had to wait for some shoes but they 're leaving here for Camden the first of October and that 's definite . Shall we go up , darling ? You know I 'm in a tearing hurry  --  " Celia opened the gate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who smiled and said , " Thank you , Miss  --  why , I do n't believe I know your name . " Before Celia could say anything Mrs. Kirby was saying it for her . " Why this is Celia Garth , she came to work here after you went to the country last year  --  " " Garth ? " repeated Mrs. Torrance , and Celia thought her facep260showed a flicker of displeasure . But Mrs. Torrance said politely , " How do you do , Miss Garth , " and Celia curtsied and said , " How do you do , Mrs. Torrance . " She went to the staircase door and opened it , and they went through , Mrs. Kirby still rattling on. "  --  have it made with a skirt of gray and green stripes and a plain green overskirt looped rather high  --  " Celia returned to her table and took out the ruffle she was hemming . She was glad the British soldiers were suffering in their woolens . The temperature this afternoon was about eighty , not too hot if you wort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy red coats and tight belts . She hoped the shipment destined for Camden would get lost , so the men there would have to go on suffering . Oh , how she hated everybody . She hated Mrs. Kirby and Mrs. " Torrance . She hated Mrs. Baxter , who came in and ordered some kerchiefs embroidered with her initial . C for Charlotte , said Mrs. Baxter , and Celia wondered if she thought they had forgotten how she used to dislike being called by the name of the British queen . Or maybe , as long as she was being socially accepted by the winning side , Mrs. Baxter just did not care . She hated her old schoolmate Rena Fairbanks , who came in with three handsome young Britishers , red coats and high shiny boots and hair glistening white with powder . Rena said she would n't be a minute , so the men sat down in front of the balustrade to wait for her . Celia opened the gate . At the ball New Year 's Eve Rena had been cordial , but today she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to be too friendly with a sewing-girl before these elegant aristocrats . All the British officers were aristocrats . They had to be . Even the most broadminded of them were astonished at the American army , where tailors and ironworkers held commissions and gave orders to the sons of gentlemen . Celia returned to her sewing . She heard one of the redcoats saying the rebel soldiers on the prison-ship in the harbor were deserting by scores to join the Tory troops . Celia wondered if this was true . She knew the British were offering them all sorts of inducements to do so . Well , if it was true she would n't be sur/prised . Why expect the prisoners to be any better than their friends on shore ? The door opened again and three persons came in , a middleagedcouple and a young girl . The man and woman were stout and red-faced and elaborately dressed ; the girl , about seventeen years old , was rather pretty , or would have been if she too had not been so overdressed in ruffles and silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers she giggled , her mother inclined her head as though in awe , and her father slapped the counter loudly , like a man in a tavern summoning the barmaid . Celia set aside her workbasket and came in answer . The man announced that his name was Hendrix and he came from down Beaufort way . He said this was his wife Mrs. Hendrix and this was his daughter Miss Dolly , and the ladyfolks wanted to see some of them imported silks . Celia said she would go upstairs and report their wants . Mr. Hendrix told her to step lively . And remember , he called after her , they wanted to see only the best . Do n't waste their time showing them nothing but the best . Celia went upstairs and told Miss Perry . Miss Perry exclaimed , " Dear dear , we do get such astonishing people in here nowadays , " and asked Ruth Elbert to wait on the Hendrixes . Ruth went into the big display room , where the walls were lined with shelves piled with bolts of material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acidly to Celia , " All right , bring them in here . " Celia went down and told Mrs. Hendrix and Miss Dolly t hat the silks could be seen now . Pulling out a fat purse Mr. Hendrix gave his wife a ( handful of money  --  " these working women always want at least half on account , you know . " He went to the door , saving he had some business on Queen Street and he 'd meet them later . Miss Dolly had been trying to flirt with the British officers , who did not want to flirt with her and were making a desperate show of interest in the Royal Gazette . Celia opened the gate . Out of the corner of her eye she observed the men 's relief as Miss Dolly and her mother went through . At another time she might have been amused . Today she wasp162not . The Hendrixes were the sort of people she hated worse than redcoats . She had seen these newly rich Tories before , and she knew how they made their money . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant the British military office on Queen Street . And it made her sick . It had come about because the more level-headed of the king 's men had been trying to stop the looting of barns and smokehouses . They knew the king 's soldiers could not eat unless the people of the country raised food , and people would not raise food unless they had a fair chance to profit from their efforts . So officers in the country districts had received commands that when their men took supplies , they must pay for what they took . To encourage food-growing , they paid rebels as well as Tories . But the payment was made by promissory notes , which could be exchanged for money only at the army office on Queen Street in Charleston . This was all right for Tory planters . But hundreds of these notes were given to people who could not come to town to cash them . There were women whose husbands were dead or prisoners of war , who could not travel alone through a war-riddled country ; there were men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get passes to travel at all . So their Tory neighbors , who did have passes , bought the notes for a fraction of their value , came to town , and redeemed them in full . Then they came into Mrs. Thorley 's shop demanding nothing but the best . As Celia led the Hendrix women upstairs she wished she could push them back down the staircase and break their necks . But she could not . She led them into the display room , curtsied respectfully , and went back to the parlor . All afternoon she smiled and answered questions and went upstairson errands . At last it was time for people to go home to supper . Mrs. Hendrix and Miss Dolly came down ; Celia opened the gate , and curtsied as they swept grandly past her and away . Gradually the other customers left . Celia began to lock up . She walked over to the side window and looked out . Oh , what a stately town it used to be , and how ugly it was now . She closed the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the front door open.  |p263She  turned with annoyance . Nobody had any business coming in so late . But the caller was Darren , saying he had purposely called at the last minute because he had hoped to find her alone . Still limping , he met her at the balustrade . " How are you ? " he asked . " All right , " said Celia . Darren looked at her keenly . Except for his limp he seemed like his old self : happy-faced , well dressed in brown linen coat and breeches , his hair brushed smooth and tied behind . As he looked her over he shook his head . " You do n't look all right , " he said . " I 'm tired , " she returned , " and cross . " " Any special trouble ? " he asked in his pleasant sympathetic way . " No . Just everything . " " Maybe this will cheer you up , " said Darren . " I 've come to bring you an invitation . Godfrey and Ida want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penfields , and me , if you 're interested  --  " " And Major Brace , " she asked , " and Captain Woodley ? " These were the two Britishers billeted in Godfrey 's home . " And a few more redcoats ? No I wo n't . " The room was getting dark , but she could see Darren frown with surprise . " Brace and Woodley are good fellows , Celia , " he said . " You 'll like them . " " No ! " Celia said harshly . She had been keeping her feelings insidetoo long ; now she let herself go . " I took their miserable oath . I 'll be polite to the British and Tories who come into this shop because I 've got to hold my job . But I wo n't sit at table with them when I do n't have to , and I wo n't walk or ride or dance with them . I know everybody else has given in but I 'm sick of everybody else . " Darren 's face was grave now . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't want to take that oath either , Celia . We had to . " Celia rested her elbows on the ledge that topped the balustrade . She dropped her forehead on her hands and pushed her fingers up through her hair . Without looking up she said ,  | " Oh , I know that . And I know we have to put up with the king 's men . But we do n't have to do what everybody 's doing ! Bowing and smirking  --  you 'd think the king did us a favor by sending them over here to put us back in our place . Oh , I hate every man in a red coat or a green coat  --  but even worse I hate all these people who are groveling in front of them . " She raised her head . " I feel so helpless , Darren ! Like a worm being stepped on . " Darren picked up his cane , which he had leaned against the balustrade . Looking down , he moved the point of the cane on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up and spoke briskly . " Look . I do n't really want to go to Godfrey 's Sunday . I 'd rather be with you . Suppose I pick up some dinner somewhere , then come by here for you and we take a walk . " She smiled . It was her first genuine smile of the day . " Oh Darren , you 're so nice ! But your leg  --  wo n't that be hard on you ? " " We can rest in the corner park on Broad Street . Will you ? " " I 'd love to . " " Good . And we can drop in for tea at that new place on Cumberland Street . They serve luscious buns with the tea . I 'll call for you about three  --  right ? " She nodded and thanked him again , and Darren limped away . Celia went around to the front of the counter and locked the door . She felt better . But she was not sure she wanted to go to that new place on Cumberland Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Americans who had been patriots last year but who were now swilling tea by the quart to prove how much they loved the king . She did not want to drink tea with them . In fact , now that she thought of it , she did not want to drink tea at all . Sunday was a gleaming day , a day for flowers and pretty clothes . Again Celia did not go to church . She washed her hair , and while it was drying she took out her prayer book and read the Bible lesson for the day . Darren called for her , and they walked out among the other Sunday strollers . Darren had very little to say . Celia spoke of what nice weather it was , and how delicious the sweet-olivep265blooms smelt across the garden walls . But though Darren answered , he seemed to be thinking of something else . She was surprised . It was not like him to take a girl out and then not pay attention to her . On Broad Street , at the corner in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with benches under them , a favorite spot for people to rest and chat on pleasant days . Because of his stiff leg , Celia expected Darren to want to rest on the first empty bench they came to . But he did not ; they roamed under the trees for several minutes before he suggested that they sit down . He had chosen a bench under an oak heavily hung with moss . The tree cast a deep shadow , and the ground before them was slightly damp . When they sat down Darren still had almost nothing to say . He began drawing designs on the ground with the point of his cane , as if he had purposely chosen a seat where the ground was soft enough for this . Celia tried to make conversation . " I wonder how Vivian 's flowers are doing . If I were at Sea Garden now , I 'd be planting stock and carnations . " " I do n't know much about gardening , " Darren said . " Is this the time to plant those ? " " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon . " " Why the new moon ? " " I do n't know . Probably silly , but that 's when it 's done . " There was another pause . With his cane Darren made more curlicues on the ground , and then rubbed them out with his foot . Another couple on a bench near them got up and walked on . With a glance around him Darren stood up , saying , " Stay where you are , I just want to stretch my bad leg . " l le walked all the way around the tree , and as she turned to watch him she observed that nobody was sitting near them now . Evidently this was what he had been waiting for . As he sat down again he said in a low voice , " Celia , I 've got something to tell you . " She answered eagerly . " Yes , Darren ? " Again he was scratching absently on the ground . Watching his cane , he said in a careful undertone , " Keep your voice down  --  just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , " she said faintly . " All right . "  |p266Still  watching the nonsense design he was drawing , Darren nodded . " That 's it . And do n't act surprised . Understand ? " Celia felt excited . She had no idea what she was about to hear , but it sounded important  --  in fact , Darren made it sound almost creepy . " I understand , " she said . " I 've got a message for you , " said Darren . He was still watching the ground . " A message , " she repeated breathlessly . " You mean a letter ? " " No , no , not a letter . A message . " " Who sent- it ? " " Friend of yours . And please , " Darren said through his teeth , " do n't ask me who . Do n't mention any names at all . " " All right , " she said , just above a whisper . She added , " I 'm listening . " With his foot , again Darren began smoothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've got a Bible , have n't you ? " Celia caught her breath . This sounded like Luke . Darren was a dear , but he was no deep student of Scripture or anything else . No wonder he did not want her to speak Luke 's name . Luke had been a fugitive with Marion , and if the British had not capturedMarion after their victory at Camden they were certainly looking for him . If they should hear that Darren had been in touch with a friend of Marion 's , they might throw him into jail and say he would stay there until he told them what he knew . Remembering that he had warned her not to show surprise , Celia smiled and said as quietly as she could , " Why yes , of course I 've got a Bible . " Darren had leveled the ground in front of him till it was as smooth as a sheet of paper . " This friend of yours , " he said , " told me to tell you to read a verse in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Again he began to make marks with his cane . But this time the marks were not squiggles ; they were letters , firm and clear . He wrote , " I Kings . " Celia understood . He wanted her to read something in the First Book of the Kings . " Got that ? " asked Darren . " Yes , " said Celia . He rubbed it out . In its place he wrote , " 19-18. "  |p267She  understood that too . Nineteenth chapter , eighteenth verse . " All right , " she said . " Sure you wo n't forget ? " " I wo n't forget . " " And you wo n't speak of it ? " " Not to a living soul . " Darren rubbed out the figures , and drew more zigzags on the ground where they had been . Celia said in her mind , First Kings 19-18 . Darren stood up . " Shall we go over to Mr. Westcott 's tea-shop ? " he asked . " I 'd rather go home , " said Celia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want , " Darren agreed smiling . They started back toward Mrs. Thorley 's . Again they did not talk much , but this time Celia was glad of it . At the side door she said , " Thanks , Darren , it was a nice walk , " and he answered , " I 'll see you again soon . " Celia ran past the parlor and upstairs . On the third floor she ran to her room , praying that Pearl and Becky would be out , and they were . She snatched up her Bible from the table where she had left it this morning . She had run up the stairs so fast that her chest hurt from lack of breath and her hands were shaking . Pausing a moment she breathed deeply , and tried to be calm as she turned the leaves . Here it was . First Kings . Nineteenth chapter . Eighteenth verse . Her eyes darted over the lines . " Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Celia read it twice . With a puzzled shake of her head she sat down to read it again . This time she told herself not to be in such a hurry . She went back to the start of the chapter , and slowly and carefully , she began . She read how the people of Israel had turned away from the God of their fathers , to worship the false god Baal . How the prophet Elijah had cried out to the Lord in despair . All the people , he said , had yielded to the false god . But an answer came to Elijah . He was wrong.  |p268Celia  sat up straight . She remembered her own words to Darren the other day . She had talked about " everybody . " Now he had brought her an answer . " Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel , all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal  --  " As she closed the Bible Celia felt a thrill of certainty . Everybodyhad not yielded . Something was going to happen.  |p269SOMETHING  DID @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two days later , on Tuesday , Celia was summoned to Mrs. Thorley 's office . Mrs. Thorley said she had received a note from Mrs. Godfrey Bernard , asking that Miss Garth be allowed to take supper with her this evening . The girls ' evening engagements were carefully supervised , but Mrs. Thorley said Mrs. Bernard understood the rules . The note said her husband 's cousin Darren Bernard would call for Celia and escort her back to the shop by nine o'clock . So permission was granted . After her curt refusal of Sunday dinner , Celia was surprised that Ida should invite her again . But Darren must have softened what she had said , or maybe  --  the thought burst like light upon her maybe this was no ordinary invitation to supper . She said , " Oh thank you , Mrs. Thorley . " When Darren called , she was dressed and waiting . The maid told her the young gentleman had said the evening was chilly and Miss Garth would please wear her cloak . Celia did not relish the idea . The evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an ash-gray cape with a hood , which Aunt Louisa had bought for her three years ago . It was the sort of thing you would expect Louisa to buy , so heavy and sensible that it wasp270likely to last ten years more . Celia compromised by throwing it over her arm . When she went down she saw Darren glance at the cloak as if to make sure she had brought it , and also she noticed that he too was carrying one . As they went down the side street toward the corner he asked , in a low voice such as he had used last Sunday , " Can you hear me now ? " So she had been right  --  this was no ordinary invitation . " Yes , " she said breathlessly . " There 's a carriage waiting for us at the next corner , " said Darren . " Not Godfrey 's , but do n't say anything . " Celia nodded . She felt quivery . Something was happening and she wished she knew what it was . The sun had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led her to a carriage . It looked like a cheap coach-for-hire , the sort you could see any day on almost any street . The paint was peeling , the horse was scrubby , and the coachman was no beauty either . He was shabbily dressed and looked half asleep , his hat pulled over his eyes and his chin sunk into his collar . Darren opened the door and Celia got in . The inside of the coach was no prettier than the outside . The floor was covered with straw instead of a carpet ; the seat-cushions were worn , and in several places she saw that the cotton stuffing was coming through . Instead of glass the windows had panes of tin pierced with little holes , such as she had seen in so many broken windows in town . When Darren got in and closed the door , the two of them sat almost in the dark . The horse started . Celia bumped , and caught the seat on either side of her . " Where are we going ? " she whispered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added , " You trust me , do n't you ? " " Yes , of course , " she returned hastily , thinking that if she had not trusted him she would have been scared silly . Darren said , " Here 's your supper . " He took up a picnic basket from a corner and put it on her lap . With a feeling that none of this could possibly be real , Celia opened the basket . Inside she found a napkin , and buttered biscuits holding slices of ham and chicken breast , and a corked bottle of water . Darren said it was all for her , he had finished his.  |p271Celia  ate her supper . In spite of the jolting of the coach this was not hard to do , for the biscuits were crisp and flaky , the meat was good , and she was hungry . When she had dampened the napkin and washed her hands , she put bottle and napkin back into the basket . " It 's sort of a long way , is n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you anything at all , " Darren answered in a voice of apology . " It 's not safe to talk . Put on your cloak  --  pull the hood up around your face . Here , I 'll help you . " As she put on the cloak he told her to keep it wrapped around her when she got out of the coach , and take no chance of being recognized . Then he put on his own , and since men 's cloaks had no hoods he pulled down his hat like the driver 's . Celia had a spooky feeling . It was all so strange . She did not know where she was going or why she was going there . She did trust Darren , she told herself  --  of course she did , she had no reason at all to be scared . But she was scared all the same . The horse stopped . Saying " Wait for me , " Darren left her and closed the door behind him . A minute or two later he was back . " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . Celia got out , hidden as well as possible inside her cloak and hoping she would not have to wear it much longer because it was far too warm . She had a glimpse of a dark alley between two brick walls . Nothingelse , for Darren led her quickly to a door in one of the walls . The door opened at his touch , and Celia guessed that he had left her to get it opened so she would not stand waiting outside . She wondered if this was because he did not want her to he seen , or because he did not want to give her time to look around and see where she was . Maybe both . They went into a pitch-black entry . Celia thought of the storybooksthe girls at school used to smuggle in and read secretly , with delicious shivers at the plight of the maiden lured to a ghostly castle for a fate worse than death -- oh stop this , she ordered herself . Imagining things . But she had not imagined that strange ride and she was not imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremor that ran over her nerves as she heard the door shut behind her . Now I 'm here , she thought , and I do n't know where I am and I ca n't get out . In front of her , about the level of her hip , she saw a slit of light . Beside it she made out the lines of a female figure . Thep272woman carried a lantern with a panel that could be moved to change the size of the opening through which the light shone , and she had set it for a tiny beam . She was holding the lantern at her side , so that Celia could see the floor but not the woman 's face . Darren whispered that they were to follow her . The woman turned and they walked behind . Celia made out that she had a dumpy little figure , and that she wore a blue dress with a white kerchief and cap  --  details that would have fitted about a thousand women within a mile . They went down a short flight of brick steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a door . The woman opened the door . A dim diffused glow came out into the passage . In spite of its dimness , the woman kept herself in the shadow of the door so Celia still could not see what she looked like . Inside , across the doorway hung a sort of curtain . It looked like a sheet , or rather two sheets overlapping each other so you could push one of them aside and go between them into the room . Celia felt so tense that she simply had to say something . She asked Darren , " Do I go in there ? " Darren said " Yes . " Without saying anything else he held back one of the curtains so she could slip between them . Celia went in . She had thought he would follow her , but he did not . She heard this door too close behind her . She was alone . The room was lighted by two candles on a table . Celia looked around . She saw nobody . She heard nothing . She felt goosebumpson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She twisted her hands together . This was creepier and creepier . She had never been in such a strange place . It was like being inside a box . The room was small , about twelve by fifteen feet . The floor and walls were covered with cloth . The cloth on the floor was canvas such as Vivian had used on the ballroom floor at Sea Garden ; and on all four walls , hanging from just under the ceiling , were curtains of heavy unbleached homespun . Looking up , Celia saw that more sheets of homespun had been tacked across the ceiling . She fancied now that she heard a faint movement overhead . She thought back  --  the door from the alley had been at ground level , the strange woman had led them down a flight of stepsp273this room must be a basement . The air seemed faintly musty but not oppressive . No doubt there were gratings at ground level which could be opened to let in air . But this was all she could guess . The canvas on the floor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muffle sounds but would prevent anybody 's describing the place so it could be recognized when the hangings were removed . In the middle of the room stood a home-made wooden table about four feet by two , and on either side of it a backless bench . There was no other furniture , and there was nothing on the table but the two candles . They were common tallow dip 's , in candlesticks of plain metal , the sort you could buy anywhere . Nothing , Celia thought again , that would let her give away any clue to where she had been . She heard a click . It came from her right . Celia turned her head sharply . She could feel her heart thumping . She heard another click . A door behind that curtain over there was being opened . Evidently that door also stood where two sections of the curtain overlapped  --  she saw a hand grasping the edge of one curtain to move it aside . She stood tensely , her heart pounding , her hands clasped tight in front of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low merry laugh as a voice of teasing humor said , " Well , Sassyface ! " Celia was so relieved to hear Luke 's voice that sheer casing of nerves sent a sob into her throat , and tears came pouring down her cheeks . Fumbling for her handkerchief with one hand she covered her eyes with the other , trying to press back the tears , and almost instantly he was there beside her . She felt hint grip her shoulder through her cloak . " Stop that ! " he said . His voice was thick with his effort to keep it low . " If you ca n't work without bawling  --  if you ca n't work without showing anything by your face  --  you 're no good and we do n't want you . " Maybe it was still the result of strain , hut at any rate , though she did not know what he was talking about Celia found her sobs turning to laughter . Tears still on her checks , she choked out , " It 's so funny , Luke  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckle . As she dried her eyes he answered , " Anyway  --  " he spoke with emphasis  --  " I meant what I said about the tears . " Celia pushed back her hood . She looked up at his tanned face and his brilliant blue eyes , and her curiosity would wait no longer . " Luke , " she demanded , " what am I here for ? " " To help win the war , " said Luke . He turned toward the table , and she saw that he was carrying , tucked under his arm , an hourglass on a silver base  --  the same hourglass that had timed her conversation with Vivian the day she first called at the house on Meeting Street . Luke was dressed in a heavy unbleached homespun shirt and leather breeches and thick high boots , and she guessed that he had a leather coat and gloves somewhere  --  the costume of a swampdodger . In peacetime a man would wear such clothes to go huntingin that wet tangle of forest ; today he would wear them to hide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into town , Luke ? " she asked . Without answering , Luke drew out one of the benches by the table . It moved silently over the cloth-covered floor . " Sit here , " he said . Celia took off her cloak and obeyed . Luke sat across from her , moved the candles to the two ends of the table so he could look at her directly , and placed the hourglass by his elbow . Like a man with no time to spare , he came straight to the heart of what he had to say . " Celia , what will you do to get rid of the redcoats ? " His words gave her a sense of liberty . Ever since that horrible day at Bellwood she had felt like an angry animal , but like an animal in a cage , with no way to fight back . " I 'll do anything , " she answered . She repeated , " Anything . " " Dear girl , " said Luke , " there 's no such thing as a job doing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled a little . " Now tell me how much you 're willing to do . " Celia considered . " If you want me to kill somebody  --  Tarleton , for instance I 'll be glad to . " " Do n't be silly , " said Luke . " You do n't know how to fire a gun . What will you do that you can do ? "  |p275She  thought again . " If you want me to go on an errand , a dangerous errand where I might get hurt or even killed , 1 ' 11 go . " " That 's better , " he said . He leaned nearer . His blue eyes held hers in a hard straight gaze . " Will you lie , cheat , steal  --  " " Of course , " said Celia . " I have n't finished , " said Luke . " Will you do this , knowing that any day you may be caught and we ca n't help you ? " She did not quite understand what he meant , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said again . " It wo n't be fun , " said Luke . " I have n't had any fun lately . " Luke was very serious . " Darren told me how you felt . I could n't see you right away , so I sent you that message . Now I 'm going to explain what you can do . When I 've told you , think it over . Say no if you want to . Darren will take you home and you 'll never hear about this again . I 'd like to have you with us , but not unless you 're with us all the way , not a single doubt . Now listen . " Celia had no doubts at all . If she could do something to get rid of the redcoats she wanted to start doing it now , tonight , right this minute . But if Luke wanted to talk , let him . " I 'm listening , " she said . " All right , " said Luke . " Some people have given in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people have not given in . We 're still fighting . We 're going to free this country or die trying . Some of us will die trying . One of them may be me , and one of them may be you . " He spoke with grim earnestness . But Celia was feeling pinpricks of pleasure . " What I want you to do , " Luke said to her , " is to be a spy . I 'm asking you because I think you can do it . Not everybody can . There are plenty of patriots in Charleston , but t hey have n't got what you 've got . " Celia was not sure what her special talents were , but he was telling her . " For one thing , " said Luke , " you notice what goes on around you . I remarked on that the first time I saw you  --  remember ? " She nodded . Luke went on.  | " In the second place , you can keep your mouth shut . That 's a rare gift , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetly at people you hate . " Celia knew she could do that . She did it every day . " Now , " said Luke , " I 'll tell you what we want . " Celia was leaning forward , her lips parted , her hands clasped on the table before her . She could fairly feel herself coming alive . " We want information , " said Luke . " We want to know what the British arc doing and what they 're going to do next . We do n't care how you get the facts . Listen at keyholes , read other people 's mail  --  just get the facts . You 'll have no reward . If you 're caught  --  I 've told you that already . What do you say ? " Celia drew a happy breath . " Yes . Yes . Yes . " " You 're that sure ? " " Oh Luke , you do n't understand ! " she exclaimed . " What do you think I 've been doing since that day at Bellwood ? Just breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a reason ! Suppose I do get caught ? What can they do to me ? I 've got nothing they can take away . I 've got no future . Oh Luke , whatever you 're doing  --  let me help do it ! " Luke gripped both her hands . He gave her a grin of comradeship . " Good . " He glanced at the hourglass . " How that sand does run . I 've got a lot to say so I 'll talk fast . Listen , and remember . " Celia listened . Luke said it was strange , how Fate worked things out . What seemed like a tragedy was sometimes a piece of great good luck . This had happened twice to the friends of liberty in South Carolina . Remember when Francis Marion fell out of the window and broke his ankle , how distressed they were at losing him ? But the city would have fallen even if he had been there . When the city was taken , every Continental officer in the garrison was made prisoner . Marion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner . Of course the British knew that so popular an officer would become a center of resistance if he was left at large . They had set out at once to capture him . Marion was still so crippled that he had to be lifted on and off a horse . But with the help of hisp277devoted Negro Buddy , of soldiers like Luke who had escaped the British attacks , of friends like Herbert and Vivian who hid him in their homes , Marion had slipped around like a ghost . The British had not found him . Then Marion went to join the army of Gates , and here came the second misfortune . Gates shoved him out of the way . But the result was that when Gates lost the battle of Camden , Marion was not there to be killed or taken . He was still free , Luke said triumphantly , to lead the men of the Lowcountry who wanted to fight . And how they wanted to fight ! Celia knew about Tarleton . But had she heard of a man named Wemyss ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As she knew , most of the Scotch-Irish farmers around Kingstreehad stayed out of the war . Busy with their flax and wool , they had asked only to be let alone . But after the fall of Charlestonthey received Clinton 's order that every man in South Carolinawas now subject to call for the king 's army , and if a man refused to serve he could be hanged for treason . The Kingstree men got mad . If they were going to fight , it would be for themselves and not for a king three thousand miles away . They began to organize , and sent a scout to look for Marion and ask him to be their leader . It was this scout who had found Marion at the camp of Gates . ' With his other followers Marion went to the camp of the Kingstree men and led them to destroy the boats as Gates had ordered . But after Gates ' defeat Marion and his band  --  about a hundred and fifty men  --  had to go into a secret camp to avoid capture . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were rising , sent troops of his own into that district . Their leader was Major James Wemyss . Luke said Cornwallis had never shown himself unduly savage . It might be that he had not intended for Wemyss to do what he did . But anyway , Wemyss did it . Along the road from Kingstree to Cheraw , Wemyss cut a swath seventy miles long and fifteen miles wide . In this strip , when they had emptied the houses of everything worth stealing , Wemyss ' men set fire to every building , destroyed every loomp278and storehouse , killed every animal on the farms . When they got through , that whole stretch of country looked like what Celia had seen at Bellwood . How many girls were raped , how many babies and old people died , nobody knew . Rumors of Wemyss ' march came to Marion in his hidden camp on Lynches Creek . He sent scouts to find out the truth . Luke spoke tersely across the table . " Celia , we saw those people skulking in the ruins like animals , eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to men who had never fought the king . ' Hwy had n't joined up with us because they still thought they could live in peace . They came out like crazy men , yelling Where 's Marion ? ' Celia , you 're not crying again , " he broke off , for she had dropped her head on her hands , covering her eyes . Celia shook her head . " No , I 'm not crying . I was thinking  --  Agnes Kennedy . So that 's why she 's not back . " " Kennedy ? " Luke repeated . " There 's a lot of Kennedys through there , I do n't know . Friend of yours ? " " She worked in the shop . Funny , I did n't even like her very much , but she never hurt anybody . She could n't even swat a fly without feeling sorry for it . I wonder what they did to her . " Celia looked up , resolutely calm . " Go on , Luke . " Luke had no more time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now men are coming to us from all over . But we ca n't fight a war with our fists . " He spoke crisply . " We need guns , clothes , shoes . Some of those fellows came to us half naked . Wemyss had burnt up everything they owned . For something to fight with , we 've raided sawmills and beaten the saws into sabers . In the farmhouses outside Wemyss ' line of march women have melted their kitchen pans to make us bullets . We take guns and powderhornsfrom dead Britishers . But it 's not enough . We need every-thing . " Celia wondered where she would get guns and powder-horns , and how she would send them to Marion 's men if she had them . But Luke was still talking and it was her business to listen . Luke told her the British expected to finish up the war in a few months , probably by next spring . They knew just how they meant to do it . Their plan , he added , was no secret . " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p279As  she knew , after Charleston surrendered , Sir Henry Clinton went to New York . The city of New York was the headquarters of the northern wing of the king 's army , as Charleston was now the base of the army in the south . Clinton had left Cornwallis in command of the southern army . Now that South Carolina ( as they thought ) was licked , the redcoatsexpected to have an easy time in the south . They had a strong fort in Florida , at St. Augustine ; and they held Savannah , as well as other major points in Georgia . Cornwallis thought all he had to do was organize military government in South Carolina , then he could leave a small force to keep order while he , with his main army , marched northward . " In the meantime , " said Luke , " Clinton plans to hold enough men around New York to keep Washington busy , but to have a strong force from the northern army start south . The two armies expect to meet halfway , in Maryland or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , say the end of November  --  anyway , before Christmas . If they do get together , it will mean that they 'll hold everything from Florida to the Hudson River . Then , together , they can close on General Washington , at West Point or somewhere near by . " He paused . " Get it ? " " Yes , " said Celia , " I understand . " Luke smiled . " That 's what I like about you , Celia . You 're definite . You do n't say I think so , ' or Well , sort of . ' You say yes or no . " He glanced at the hourglass . The sand was still running , so he went on . " The trouble with this plan , Celia , is that it 's good . Those two British armies together will he stronger than anything Washington can bring to face them . Now here 's our job . " She nodded . " I 'm listening . " " Our job , " said Luke , " is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong enough to meet Cornwallis in open battle . But we can pester him . We can raid his outposts . Attack his supply trains . Slow down everything he tries to do . In the meantime the Americans in North Carolina will have time to get ready for him . They can slow him down some more . You see , we know Washington is negotiating with the king of France for morep280Frenchmen to fight on our side . But the Frenchmen ca n't get here for six months , maybe a year . If those two British armies meet before the Frenchmen get here  --  well , we ca n't let them meet , that 's all . " He covered her hands with his , and spoke with a desperate earnestness . " Celia , every day we can delay Cornwallis is one more day for changing the Thirteen Colonies into the United States of America . Understand ? " " Oh yes , yes , yes ! " said Celia . She added joyfully , " And we can always hold him back one more day ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia ! " " Go on , Luke ! How do we do it ? " Luke began to speak more calmly . He said things would be easier if they were dealing with a clumsy fool . But Cornwallis was a smart man . Besides his two major bases at Charleston and Camden , he had set up British posts all over the state : at Georgetownand Beaufort on the coast , at Orangeburg , Ninety-Six , and other strategic points of the interior ; at Quinby Bridge on the eastern fork of the Cooper River , Nelson 's Ferry on the Santee . " In fact , " said Luke , " he 's got us enclosed in a ring of redcoats . Sounds tough , and it is . But every one of those posts has got to have a steady stream of supplies or the men ca n't stay there . They have to send letters back and forth  --  make reports , get orders . We want those supplies . We want those letters . We want to take some prisoners so we can exchange them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred little skirmishes , so they 'll never know where we 're going to turn up next . Then Cornwallis will have to use his troops to guard the roads instead of marching them north . " Celia said slowly , " I see what you meant a few minutes ago . A lot of men will get killed . " " A lot of them do n't care , " Luke said quietly . When she gave a start of disbelief , he said , " Miles Rand , for instance  --  he 's with us . She had no answer for this . So she asked , " Is Amos with you ? " Luke said yes ; and Big Buck too . Celia exclaimed , " Then you must get word to Marietta . " " She knows , " Luke said smiling . " Now let 's talk about you . " " Yes , let 's , " Celia said eagerly . " What can I do , Luke ? Me ? "  | " Plenty , " said Luke . " You 're in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop all day . You can notice them , hear what they say , tell us . Also you can meet them socially , at Godfrey 's . " " Luke , I 'm ashamed of myself . I thought  --  " " I know what you thought . People will think the same thing about you . Let them . " " What about Burton ? " she asked . " You know , Celia , I 'm proud of that large pink brother of mine . He still has n't taken the oath . He 's standing there like a rock , pained at Godfrey , and we have to let it go on like that . We ca n't let him work with us . " " Why not ? " " My dear girl , " said Luke , " you should know . Burton ca n't keep anything from Elise , and telling anything to Elise is like printing it in the paper . She 'd have us all in that dungeon under the Exchange . Let 's get back to you . " He spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to us , let us know . For the present your friends will be Darren , Godfrey , and Ida . " " How do I tell them ? " " Some women , " said Luke , " have used the scheme of putting a workbasket on the windowsill . This means they have something to tell . Somebody passes the window several times a day , and if the basket is there he passes the word to somebody else , to come in and get the message . Try that once or twice , then think of anothercode . Keep changing , that 's vital . " " Suppose the shop is full of people ? How do I give anybody a message ? " " Write it and have it ready . Write it in the fewest possible words , on the smallest possible slip of paper , so you can hide it inside a thimble or something like that . If it 's that tiny , you can pass it over  --  say with a sample of cloth  --  and not he seen . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked . Luke laughed softly . " You do n't need to know that . " " If I should notice something , " said Celia , " how do I know if it 's important ? "  | " You do n't . Tell us anyway . It 's better we should get a hundredtrivial messages than miss one that we need . And be as quick as you possibly can . Remember : men are going to live or die becauseof you . " For a moment they were both silent . Celia was realizing that this was no romantic escapade into which he was leading her . It was an enterprise hard and stern . To do it , she would have to be hard and stern . She asked , " Are there many others in town , spying for Marion 's men ? " " Yes , " said Luke , " but it 's better you do n't know too much about them . The fact is , " he added , laughing a little , " I do n't think anybody knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She heard this with astonishment , and he went on . " We do n't know how he got news of Camden . He was with us in the woods , chopping up boats moored at the river landings . But one day he knew . He did n't tell a single man of us . He was afraid we 'd lose our spirit . Instead he led us straight to Nelson 's Ferry in time to attack a British force moving some American prisoners down to Charleston , and we set free the prisoners . Now how did he find out they were going to cross the river just then ? We do n't know . " " Does n't he trust anybody ? " she asked wonderingly . " It 's not that , Celia . But the less you have to hide , the easier it is to hide it . " Again Luke glanced at the hourglass . " Sand 's out . We 've got to get you back on time . " Reluctantly , Celia pushed back the bench and stood up . She wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was something tickling her memory , but she could not quite get hold of it . Maybe it was about Sea Garden . Maybe it concerned Roy 's mysterious visit . As Luke came around the table and picked up her cloak , she asked , " I suppose Vivian told you Roy came to Sea Garden  --  do you know what he came for ? " " No , I wish I did , " said Luke . " We 've heard nothing about him since that day . " He held out her cloak . Celia put it on and drew up the hood , still trying to catch whatever it was at the back of her mind . Shep283had just learned so many strange and startling matters that her head felt like an overpacked trunk where it was hard to find anything . " Will I see you again ? " she asked . " Oh yes . Right now it 's my job to organize the information system in Charleston , so I 'll be here a while . " Celia was glad of that . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her a feeling of strength renewed . She wished she could find that memory she was looking for . " I 'll call Darren , " said Luke . He caught both her hands in his , and gave them a squeeze . " So now you 're one of us . Good luck , Sassyface . " Before she could answer he had turned and was crossing the room . Without looking back he disappeared between the homespuncurtains on the wall.  |p284The  COACH was waiting at the entrance to the alley . Celia had expected that now Darren would let her see where she was , but he hurried her inside . As the horse started Darren leaned closer to her and said in a voice she could barely hear , " We 're going to Godfrey 's . We want to give the impression that you 've been there all evening . " Celia said " Yes , of course , " and Darren added , " But we may go in or we may not  --  I 'll explain later . " Again Celia said " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glad that Darren too was silent , for she was trying to go over in her mind what she had learned tonight . The coach stopped sooner than she had expected . When they got out she saw that they were on King Street , near Tradd Street where Godfrey lived . So the meeting-place had not been as far from the shop as she had thought . Evidently on their first ride the driver had taken a long zigzag route . If she had not chosen to join them , or if they had decided that she had better not be trusted with their secrets , he would have brought her back by the same long route and she could never have guessed where she had been . " The coach rattled off . The driver had let them out in a business block , where now in the evening the buildings were closed andp285dark . There was not much chance of anybody 's being around to observe them . They walked to the residential neighborhood of Tradd Street . Here the windows were lighted , the gardens were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of dance music . Celia remembered what Sophie had said at Sea Garden last summer , that Charleston had never been so gay . But now she did not feel the helpless disgust she had felt then . Now she knew about the secret war . At Godfrey 's door , Darren put a key into the lock and drew her inside . Later he told her that Ida had arranged a signal for him by her manner of draping the curtain at a certain window . The two officers billeted in the house had gone out tonight to a party , and the curtain had told him they were still out . If they had returnedhe would have taken Celia directly back to the shop . Godfrey and Ida were waiting in a room off the front hall . Godfrey shook her hand with warm welcome , and Ida said , " Sit down , here 's your dessert . " She uncovered a dish on which there was a fruit pudding piled with whipped cream . Celia had always thought of Ida as a colorless person , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Celia , " I 'm so glad you 're with us . " Speaking in careful undertones , they told Celia they talked about their undertaking as little as possible , even among themselves . You never knew when somebody might overhear . Ida remarked that she planned to come into the shop soon to order some kerchiefs , and she was going to ask that Celia make them because Celia had done such beautiful work for Vivian . 1 Icr eyes met Celia 's with gay conspiracy , and Celia smiled at her across a spoonful of pudding . The pudding was marvelous . They all three walked with her to the shop , chatting about the weather . At the door Celia said , " Thank you for a lovely evening . " As she went toward her room she met : Hiss Perry , about to ring the nine o'clock bell . " Did you have a good time ? " Miss Perry asked , and Celia smiled and said " Yes ma'am . " In the bedroom she took a quick look at the pen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good point and there were several sheets of paper in the table drawer . If she heard anything of usep286to Marion 's men , she had material at hand for writing a note . She could get more paper next time she went out . When she woke in the morning the room was gray with dawn . Her eyes felt sandy from lack of sleep , for she had been so excited that she had lain awake long after she went to bed . But for the first time in months she had the delicious feeling that this was a new day full of promises and she was eager to begin it . She sat up and threw back the covers . It was a bright sunny day and the shop was full of people . Celia smiled prettily at them all , showed them samples , went upstairs on their errands , and between times sat hemming a capfrill , and listening . She listened till she could almost feel her ears ache . But though they talked , they said nothing . They talked about clothes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noon she was ready to cry with exasperation . A little past noon Mrs. Torrance came in , escorted by her husband and two redcoats . She said she would n't be a minute , she was just going to run up and see how her dress was coming along , so the gentlemen sat down outside the balustrade to wait for her . Celia opened the gate . Mrs. Torrance went through , carefully not giving her any sign of recognition . Mr. Torrance , a pleasant round-faced young man who looked like his sister Sophie , asked Celia if she had a copy of the Royal Gazette . She handed it to him , and the three men began lazily to discuss the day 's news . Celia resumed her sewing . One of the Britishers said the war could not last much longer . In places where American money still circulated , the American cause was rated so low that Continental bills were worth only two cents on the dollar . The others laughed , and Celia bent her head over her work , trying to look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the newspaper , remarking that the day was getting hotter every minute . Celia started . Her needle made a crooked stitch . For a moment she could not move to take the stitch out , for her hands were trembling and waves of excitement were rippling through her body . Now she knew what it was she had been trying to remem/ber , last night when she talked to Luke . She had a rriessage for Marion 's men . She could almost see and hear it . Those other redcoats last week , complaining about the hot weather ; Mrs. Torrance saying it was not the heat that bothered them , it was their heavy uniforms ; and Mrs. Kirby  --  " They 've got a shipment of lightweight clothes ready for Camden right now . . . leaving here the first of October and that 's definite . " This was real information . And that was exactly how Luke had told her to get it . Celia thought fast . Today was Wednesday . The first of October would be next Sunday . She still had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the other girls would come to take her place for the dinner hour , and she could go to the bedroom and write a note . This afternoon she would send it out . And somewhereon the road to Camden , Marion 's men would poP out of the swamp and attack the supply train . Celia unthreaded her needle , took out the crooked stitch , threaded the needle again and put the stitch in straight . I Icr heart was bumping . She glanced up . The three men were asking one another how much longer Mrs. Torrance was going to make them wait . The time dragged . Mrs. Torrance finally appeared , and her party left . Two elderly ladies came in and asked Celia a hundred questions about materials and prices , and then said they win " not decide on anything today . At last Pearl Todd came to iiuiul the parlor for the dinner hour . Pearl had already had her dinner , and she whispered , " It 's shrimp pie today , and it 's good ! " Celia managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her workbasket , and hurried up to her bedroom . Becky was not here yet . Celia drew a chair to the table and opened the inkhorn . Tearing off a slip of paper , she wrote her message in the smallest handwriting she could manage . " Wagons carrying clothes and shoes leaving Charleston for Camden October 1 . "  |p288wondered  if she should add her source of information , and decided no ; they would understand she had heard it in the parlor , and Luke had told her to be brief . But Mrs. Kirby had known about this because of her husband . His name had better be there , so they could check the statement . She added , " Purchase arranged by Mr. Robert Kirby . " There were footsteps on the stairs . The girls were coming up to their rooms to get ready for dinner . The ink on her note was still wet . As fast as she could , she slipped the paper into the drawer , closed the inkhorn , and laid down the pen . She pushed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door opened and Becky 's voice said , " I thought Miss Loring would never let us go ! I 'm starving . " Celia poured water into the basin and began to wash her hands . She had a blot on her finger . Scrubbing at the blot , she said , " Pearl told me we 're having shrimp pie . " The way her temples were throbbing , she was surprised that she could say anything . She had to get her note out of the table drawer . If Becky would only go downstairs ! But Becky washed her hands , took off her cap , smoothed her hair , put her cap on again , said she was going out Sunday with two perfectly charming men . Redcoats , but really it was all wrong what some people said about redcoats , they were just as nice as anybody else once you got used to the funny way they talked . Did n't Celia think it was all right for a girl to go out with them ? Celia , remembering the part she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it 's all right . " The dinnerbellsounded . They both started for the door , but Celia bumped against a bedpost and stumbled . " Oh dear ! " she exclaimed . " I 've torn my kerchief . I 'll have to change it . Go on down , Becky , I 'll be there in a minute . " Becky went out . Celia changed her kerchief , hiding the old one so nobody would see that it was not torn at all . She dashed to the table . The ink on her note was dry now . She folded the paper over and over till it made a tiny wad , slipped the wad into her handkerchief , put the handkerchief into her pocket and went downstairs , reaching the dining room door just in time to stand aside and let Mrs. Thorley go in ahead of her . The shrimp pie was good , but Celia ate so little that Miss Perryp289asked if she did not feel well . Celia said oh yes , she felt fine , and she hurriedly swallowed a morsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was glad when it was time to leave the table . She went back to the parlor . As she opened the door she felt a tremor . Suppose there should be redcoats here ? Some of them might be on the lookout for spies . But the only visitors were a placid plump couple named Duff , examining samples of men 's shining which Pearl was showing them . Dutiful and bored , Pearl was glad to have Celia take her place at the balustrade . Mr. and Mrs. Duff were not people who had a great deal to do . Selection of material for half a dozen shirts was an interesting event in their lives . Besides the question of material , there was the decision of how the shirts should be made  --  with tucks down the front , or the little frills that men were wearing this year ? These details were so important , they said to Celia . Celia said tucks and frills were both fashionable , but the frills were more expensive because they took longer to make . Mr. and Mrs. Duff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three shirts made with frills and three with tucks . And now , said Mrs. Duff , they would like to choose the buttons . Celia produced a box holding a variety of buttons , and set it on the counter . Her hand was shaky and she wanted to scream . For where , oh where in all this was there a chance for her to put her workbasket on the windowsill ? The basket stood on the table as she had left it before dinner , its straw top neatly in place . She had expected that when she came into the parlor she would open the basket and take out the cap-frill she was making , sit by the window and sew , and put the basket on the sill as if by chance . But she could not say , " Excuse me , while you 're looking at the buttons I 'll put my workbasket in the window . " She had to stand here , smiling and answering questions , while this very minute some messenger of Luke 's might be passing the shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had nothing to report because no basket was there . Mrs. Baxter came in , accompanied by her sister from out of town , Mrs. Sloan . As they had an appointment Celia opened the gate in the balustrade , and when they had gone upstairs she re/turned to the Duffs . She told them that one of the senior seamstresses , Mrs. Woods , was in charge of making men 's shirts , and it would be better to discuss further details with her . Mr. and Mrs. Duff agreed , but they lingered awhile longer over the button-box . At last , however , they said they would like to speak to Mrs. Woods ; and Celia , trembling with impatience , went to summon her . As men were not allowed upstairs where the ladies ' fittingroomswere , Mrs. Woods led the Duffs into a side room off the parlor so Mr. Duff could take off his coat and wig , and be measured . At last , Celia was alone . Going to the table she opened her workbasket . She took out the frill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basket on the sill . I icr heart bounced like a ball rolling down a staircase . She was as conscious of the wad of paper in her pocket as if it had been a coal of fire . Desperately , grimly , she went on sewing . The Duffs finally finished their business and went home . More customers came and went . The sun moved westward over the Ashley River . Mrs. Baxter and Mrs. Sloan came downstairs , and lingered in front of the balustrade to look at the fashion dolls . A few minutes later the front door opened again , and Celia looked up to see Godfrey Bernard . Hat in hand , Godfrey paused an instant and gave a quick glance around . This was long enough for Mrs. Baxter to catch sight of him , greet him effusively , present him to her sister , and ask about Ida . Courteous as always , Godfrey said he was happy to meet Mrs. Sloan , and Ida was well , thank you . They exchangedmore pleasantries , but at length the ladies returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia was sure he had come for her message , and she was scared . She had thought working for Marion would be exhilarating ; she had not expected these stiff lips and shaking knees , nor the squeaky little voice in which she said , " How do you do , sir . " When she had been Vivian 's guest she and Godfrey had called each other by their first names , but she thought this was hardly proper for the shop . Evidently he agreed , for he said , " How do you do , Miss Garth . Remember my wife said she wanted to order some kerchiefs ? She asked me to make an appointment for her . Friday or Saturday , preferably before noon . "  |p291Celia  wondered if he too was quaking within . He did not look like it . Godfrey 's hair  --  he still had enough of his own not to need a wig  --  was neatly tied behind with a silk ribbon . He wore a dark blue linen coat and tan breeches , and a white lawn cravat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of success ; he showed none of the slack discouragement she had seen when the weather ruined the meat supply last spring . No , right now Godfrey knew what he was doing and he had no doubt that he could do it well . Behind him , Mrs. Baxter was saying the cap worn by one of the dolls was too elaborate for the dress she had on . The thought came to Celia that Godfrey 's confidence now meant that he also trusted her to do her part of the job . She said , " Certainly , Mr. Bernard . I 'll go up and speak to Miss Loring . " " Thank you , " said Godfrey . " And Miss Garth  --  " he looked at her directly  --  " will you ask her to give me a written reminder of the time ? I have a wretched memory for these things . " For the barest instant his eyes flashed to the basket on the windowsill . " Certainly , " Celia said again . She turned and opened the door to the staircase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked herself what on earth she was scared of . She was sure Mrs. Baxter had not come to the shop to look for rebel spies . In the sewing room , Miss Loring said Mrs. Bernard could come in Friday morning at ten . She noted the day and time in her book , and at Celia 's request she clipped a corner from a page and repeated the note for Mr. Bernard . Celia started downstairs . Halfway down she paused . " Faking her little wad of paper from her pocket she put it under Miss boring 's note and held it there . The last of her quakes had left her ; she felt strong and sure of herself . She went on down and with her free hand she opened the parlor door . Mrs. Baxter and Mrs. Sloan were still talking about the displaysin the cabinets . Godfrey stood by the balustrade . But also standing by the balustrade , his elbow on the counter and his hat beside him , was a good-looking young British lieutenant . For an instant Celia felt paralyzed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , she had to speak and act normally , redcoats came into the shop often and he was just another one . Godfrey was waiting ; this showed that he expected her to givep292him her message somehow . She would attend to the redcoat first  --  that was it , ask what he wanted and get rid of him . Smiling pleasantly , she went to the counter and spoke to him . " May I help you , sir ? " The redcoat smiled back . " This gentleman , " he said , politely indicating Godfrey , " was here before me . " Again Celia 's thoughts buzzed . Maybe she should give Godfrey only Miss Ioring 's note , and let him come back later for hers . But how could she know that there would not be redcoats here again , next time he came in ? And Luke had told her speed was vital . She must get her message out now , not later . She noticed how well tailored were the young Britisher 's red coat and white doeskin breeches , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she thought of what Luke had told her , that many of Marion 's men were half naked . They needed those wagonloadsof clothes . She had to give Godfrey her message and if she kept her wits about her she could do it . She remembered what Vivian had said long ago : " You can do anything you have to do . " Godfrey had acknowledged the soldier 's courtesy with a slight inclination of his head . Following this lead , Celia said , " Very well , sir . " Turning to Godfrey she held out Miss Loring 's threecorneredslip of paper , her thumb on top , her fingers hiding her own little note underneath . " Here you are , Mr. Bernard . " Godfrey closed his hand so that her wad was hidden but Miss Loring 's note was held between his thumb and forefinger . He read as though to himself , " Friday morning at ten  --  good . Thank you , Miss Garth . " He dropped his hand into his pocket , and with his other hand he picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Sloan , " he said , and went out . Speaking as calmly as possible , Celia asked the lieutenant how she could serve him . In his smooth British accent , he told her his name was Meadows . He had brought a note for Miss Becky Duren , about a change in their plans for Sunday , and he asked Celia if she would be kind enough to deliver it . Celia felt so happy that she gave him a smile more friendly than she had ever thought she would give a redcoat , and told him she would be glad to deliver his note . LieutenantMeadows bowed , thanked her , and took his leave . Mrs. Sloan called Mrs. Baxter 's attention to a pair of gloves inp293one of the cabinets . Celia returned to the chair by the window . She took her basket from the sill , opened it and took out her scissors , and put the basket on the table beside her . Her thoughts were singing . I did it , I did it , I sent a message to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meadows ' note that evening . She said she had promised to take a walk Sunday with Meadows and another officer named Captain Cole , but the note said Captain Cole had sprained his knee and could not go out . Meadows said if it was agreeable with Becky , the two of them would join a party who had engaged a carriage for Sunday . They would all go for a drive , and stop for refreshmentsat the new tea-shop on Cumberland Street . Becky had not been to the new tea-shop and she was delighted at the prospect of going there Sunday with a party of elegant people . She said she was sorry about Captain Cole , but his injury was not serious . And anyway , he was billeted at the Baxters ' and they had a lovely home . Friday morning Ida came to choose the material for her kerchiefs . Miss Loring said it was all right for Celia to make them , and Celia felt elated . This would give Ida an excuse to come in often , and receive a message if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia had begun to feel discouraged . For though she had listened as hard as she could , she had heard nothing more that could be of use to Marion 's men . She told herselfthe best spy on earth could not hear what people did not say . But the fact remained , it had been more than a week since she had caught that remark of Mrs. Kirby 's , and it did seem that she should have picked up something else . On Saturday , though the shop was full and the parlor was chatty and gay , she had hardly any chance to listen . Everybody wanted something . Celia went upstairs so many times that by afternoon she ached all over . And finally , just as she was wearily thanking heaven that it was almost time to close , Mrs. Baxter and Mrs. Sloan dropped in . Just looking , they said . They began to admire the displays , many of which had been changed since the last time they were here . They stayed , and stayed , and stayed . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tireder , but the two ladies , sitting by a table with samples spread out before them , were too much interested to leave . The supervisors were supposed to notice the time , and when customers forgot to go home Miss Loring or Miss Perry would come in and tell them the shop was closing , but Celia could not do this herself . She had to wait . So she waited , and the end was worth it . Too tired to sew , she sat with her hands in her lap , thinking about how her legs ached from all that stair-climbing . Mrs. Sloan said this gray-and-yellow striped silk was beautiful , but she simply could not wear any shade of yellow . This plain gray , though , it would be lovely combined with this dark green . She asked if Mrs. Baxter remembered the dark green dress Emily Torrance had worn to church last Sunday . Mrs. Sloan said she had noticed it particularly when Mr. and Mrs. Torrance were standing outside the church after services , chatting with Captain Cole . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's accident . " I do n't think , " said Mrs. Baxter , " that he minds it too much . " She sounded amused . " Why not ? " asked Mrs. Sloan . Mrs. Baxter laughed softly . " He had been ordered out of town on outpost duty , and you know how they all dread that . Now he ca n't go , at least not for a while . " Mrs. Sloan laughed too . " How do you know ? Did he tell you ? " " Not exactly  --  I mean  --  " Mrs. Baxter gave a half-embarrassed giggle . " Oh , I can say it to you , you 'll understand . Lieutenant Meadows came by this morning to see him , and while they were both in Captain Cole 's room I happened to pass and I noticed that the door was open . Of course I do n't make a habit of listening at doors , but I do like to hear if Captain Cole has any complaints . If your billets like you they can do you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say . " " Of course , I understand , " said Mrs. Sloan . " He was n't coinplaining , was he ? " " Oh no , they were laughing and talking , and Captain Cole was saying that now he could n't go up to Lenud 's Ferry next week . It stems he was to lead a troop there to guard the crossing . Butp295they 're to leave Tuesday , and he wo n't even be able to stand up by then . Another officer will have to take his place . And I must say I was glad to hear what Captain Cole said about it  --  he said duty was duty , but he was so comfortable with us , he was n't sorry to stay longer . I did n't know he 'd been ordered out . I suppose they are n't allowed to talk about their orders . " In her dim corner , Celia sat with every nerve strained lest she miss a word . Lenud 's Ferry was on the Santee River about twenty miles from Sea Garden , close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important crossing , which would be used for men and supplies going from Charleston into the country back of Georgetown . And a troop was leaving for Lenud 's Ferry next Tuesday . The ladies had gone back to their discussion of the samples . Mrs. Sloan was saying , " It 's a beautiful shade in this light , but I 'm not sure how it would be in bright sunshine . " The door from the staircase opened and Miss Perry came bouncing in . She told the ladies she was oh so sorry to disturb them , but really the shop had to close . The ladies were oh so welcome here , their patronage was an honor , but Mrs. Thorley made the rules and she was quite strict and would n't they conic back Monday ? Mrs. Baxter and Mrs. Sloan said they had had no idea how late it was , and they did not know what became of the time . At last they left , and Miss Perry bounced out again , and Celia began to lock up . Tired as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no way to get a message out tonight , but she could do it tomorrow . Pushing back the curtains of a front window she looked out at Lamboll Street . The sun was going down , and the street was striped with shadows and sunlight . Not far off she saw the little hairdresser Hugo , carrying his bag of pomades and curlingtongs . It was the first time she had seen I Ingo since the day he had taken the bullet from Jimmy 's leg , and the sight of him sent a painful memory shooting through her . As he came nearer she watched him , her eyes held to him by the memory . Hugo looked very spruce with his cocked hat atop his curly white wig , his fine purple coat , and the last rays of the sun flashing on the buckles of his shoes . As he passed he caught sight of her in thep296window , and doffed his hat in an elegant gesture of greeting . Apparently the day she remembered with such pain had been for him only another day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hugo pranced along . He walked into another ray of sunlight , and Celia caught her breath . Her hands on the sill , she leaned farther out , her eyes following Hugo . No doubt about it . Hugo had on fancy lacework stockings just like those that Luke had been wearing the first time she saw him . Celia drew back from the window . It had been here in this very room that she had noticed those stockings of Luke 's . She remembered herself asking , " Mr. Ansell , who made your stockings ? " She remembered how startled he had been , and how he had recovered his poise so quickly that she almost thought she had imagined it . But she had not imagined it . Engaged in dangerous business on the wagon track , Luke had had many secrets to keep from the king 's spies in Charleston . Those stockings had been a signal , like the basket on the windowsill . And they still were . Hugo , doing ladies ' hair , heard the talk of the town . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Marion wanted to know . " He 's one of us , " Celia said to herself . As she closed the window she said it again . " He 's one of us . " One of us . Where had she heard that phrase before ? In the letter written to her by Mrs. Rand , about her own engagementto Jimmy . Celia remembered how warm and friendly the words had made her feel . But she had lost all that . In these past months she had felt so unwanted and alone . Now she did not feel that way . She had heard the same phrase again somewhere , not long ago . After a moment she remembered . Luke . The other evening , when he told her good night in the curtained room , he had said , " So now you 're one of us . " She was not alone any more.  |p297As  THE NEXT DAY was Sunday and Celia had no excuse to put her workbasket in the window , after breakfast she walked over to Godfrey 's . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls were allowed to do about as they pleased , so long as they did nothing improper for the Sabbath quiet . It was still so early that there were not many people out . One or two redcoats spoke to her , but she hurried on and they bothered her no more . As she reached Tradd Street she heard a peal from the bells of St. Michael 's . She walked on to Godfrey 's house , and from the doorstep she looked across the roofs to the steeple , black on the sky . " Lighten our darkness , " she whispered as she knocked on the door . The maid showed her into the reception roost , and summonedGodfrey . He was surprised to see her . " Do n't tell me why you'vecome , " he said in a barely audible voice , and added clearly , " Glad you dropped in . I 'll take you up to sec Ida , lazy girl 's not dressed yet . " He led her upstairs to Ida 's sitting room , which opened from their bedroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , Ida was finishing her breakfast egg . In her low voice Ida explained to Celia that in these two rooms she and Godfrey could be sure of privacy  --  something not easyp298to achieve with two redcoats billeted in the house . Major Brace and Captain Woodley were courteous guests , but they were loyal to the king and it would not do to have them suspect what their host and hostess were up to . Glancing from Ida to Godfrey , and keeping her own voice as low as possible , Celia asked , " Shall I tell you why I 've come ? " They shook their heads . Godfrey cupped his hands around his mouth , bent close to her ear , and said , " I 'll send you to Luke . " Celia smiled involuntarily . Before she thought what she was saying she asked , " Where is he ? " Ida looked at Godfrey . He nodded . Whispering into Celia 's car as he had done , Ida said , " Mr. Westcott 's tea-shop on Cumberland Street . " Celia started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the talk of redcoats , but for Luke , how terribly dangerous . Yet where in town would it not be dangerous for one of Marion 's men ? Godfrey had drawn a chair close to hers and was telling her something else . " I 'll send for Darren and he 'll go with you . When a girl goes walking with a bachelor nobody pays any attention . But I 'm a married man and somebody always notices that . Besides , we go to church on Sunday mornings . " " I think it 's sacrilegious , " Celia said shortly , " for us to go to a church where they pray for the king . " " So do I , " said Godfrey , " but we 're pretending to be Tories now , and we figure the Lord will understand . " He went out , saying he would send a servant to bring Darren from the inn where he lived . Ida said to Celia that while they waited she would send for a pot of tea . " Tea ? " Celia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more , Ida . " Ida smiled wisely . " If you 're one of us , " she said in her sweet soft voice , " you 'll like tea . " Celia burst out laughing . The maid brought the tea , and they sipped like any other Tories until Darren arrived . He and Celia strolled uptown , Darren 's cane tapping on the sidewalk . The tea-shop occupied a building near the powder magazine from which Darren and Miles had helped move the gunpowder that night during the siege . Next door to the shop was a ware/house , and between them an alley  --  Celia could see now how she had been brought here in the dark . The place was well chosen . This time , in the bright light of mid-morning , they paid no attention to the alley . They went up the front steps and into the shop by the main door . The air was rich with the smell of baking . They were in an entrance hall , which had a door at each side and another door at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large room on either side . In one of these rooms , Darren told her , Mr. and Mrs. Westcott served gentlemen only ; in the other , gentlemen accompanied by ladies . In the first room several men were having late Sunday breakfasts of buns and tea . But since it was mostly single men who took breakfast out , there were no customers in the other room . A boy about twelve years old came into the hall carrying a plate of butter . Darren spoke to him . " Morning , Ricky . Tell your mother I 've brought a young lady to try her nut-bread . " Ricky grinned alertly . " Yes sir ! " he said . He carried the butter into the bachelors ' room , and Darren led Celia into the room where ladies were served . A pleasant room it was , with fresh cloths on the tables , and at one end a counter , draped with a white net to keep off flies , where Celia saw and smelt a fascinating array of tarts and buns and fancy breads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another door . This door opened and a woman came in , a nice little woman with a dumpy figure , wearing a blue dress with a white cap and kerchief  --  plainly the woman who had carried the lantern the other night . Darren introduced her as Mrs. Westcott . Mrs. Westcott spoke cordially . " I 've got a fresh batch of nutbreadthat ought to be coming out of the oven about now . Want to see it ? " She stood aside for them to go through the doorway toward the back . Darren glanced around to make sure nobody was observing them . Quickly he led Celia through this doorway . Mrs. Westcott did not follow . She closed the door behind them , and Darren led Celia along a dim hallway to another door , which he unlocked with a key from his pocket . Ahead of them a staircase led down to the cellar . Darren murmured , " I 'll go first , I know the way . " The staircase was dark and steep . With one hand Celia gatheredp300her skirt around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reaching the foot of the stairs they crossed the brick floor of the cellar to another door , barely visible by the glimmer from a sidewalk grating . Darren opened this door , beyond which she saw a homespuncurtain , and they went into the same muffled room where she had seen Luke before . Though the sun outside was bright , the curtains covering the sidewalk gratings made this room neafy dark . Drawing a bench out from the table Darren said , " Sit down . She 'll send Luke . " He rested his cane across the table and began to rub his knee . Celia sat down . A strange business this , but how proud she was to he part of it . Today was the first of October . She thought of Marion 's men , creeping silently through the silver-green light of the swamps this very day , to attack the wagons carrying clothes to Camden . They knew where to lie in wait because she had sent word when the redcoats would leave Charleston and where they were going . Luke came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single movement he strode across the room and set the candle on the table and grabbed both Celia 's hands in his . " The gallant dressmaker ! " he greeted her . " More news ? " Luke 's vitality had a grandness about it , like a forest wind . Celia said , " Yes , I heard something in the shop yesterday . " Luke sat on the edge of the table and swung his legs . " Tell us . " Celia recounted what she had heard Mrs. Baxter say about Captain Cole and the troop for Lenud 's Ferry . Luke listened intently . " Good , " he said . " Good . " He leaned nearer , his elbow on his knee . " Now tell us again . " Celia repeated her story . Luke asked several questions . At length he turned to Darren . " Got it , Darren ? " " Yes . " " Start it out now . " " Right . " Darren picked up his cane and left them . From his perch on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good job , Sassyface. "  | " Oh , and I 'm so happy doing it ! " she exclaimed . " This is the first time I 've ever felt that I was doing something really im-portant . " Luke smiled gravely . " It is important , Celia . " Their eyes met . More than Darren , more than Godfrey or anybody else , Luke made her understand that their task had greatness ; they were not merely getting rid of the redcoats , they were making a nation . Celia said eagerly , " Luke , when Marion 's men act on a message I 've sent  --  how do I know ? " Luke shook his head . " Sassyface , " he said quietly , " you do n't know . " " What ! You mean I 'll just have to  --  to hope that I 'm doing some good ? " " That 's it . You wo n't know if they get your message at all . Some letters do n't get through , some arrive too late . Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lenud 's Ferry has been attacked , you wo n't know if it was because of you . Six other people may have heard the same thing and sent it out . " Celia tried not to show her chagrin . " Well , if that 's the way it is , I 'll have to get used to it . " She smiled up at him and shrugged . " Not knowing  --  I suppose that 's the hardest part of this job . " " No it is n't , " said Luke . He spoke grimly . " Harder than that , is knowing  --  knowing , and not being able to do anything . " " What do you mean ? " " Sometimes we get a message like yours . We come close to the track they 'll have to take . We send scouts ahead . They climb trees and look . They bring back the word . We 're outnumbered six to one . And the redcoats are all armed , and a lot of our men are not . We do n't dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by . Wagons loaded with barrels of gunpowder , barrels of beef , crates of guns and shoes , letters telling about their plans . " " I should think , " said Celia , " when that happens  --  you could practically hear your heart breaking . " " It does seem like that . " " I 'm glad you told me , " she said thoughtfully . " Still , it is sort of disappointing , not to know if I 'm doing any good . " Luke put his big hand on her shoulder . " What you do know ,  |p302Celia  , " he said , " is that it 's folks like us , all together , who are keeping Cornwallis and Clinton apart . So long as the job gets done , it does n't matter who does it . Right ? " Celia nodded . " Yes , that 's right . Now can I ask you something else ? " " Go ahead . " " The Westcotts . What they 're doing  --  is n't it very dangerous ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they 've got three sons in the swamp with Marion . " " What sort of place is this ? " she asked . Luke chuckled merrily . " This is a profitable tea-shop , my girl . Mrs. Westcott makes the best pastries in town , Mr. Westcott is a shrewd manager , and they 're doing fine . They used to run a shop like this in Georgetown . When I was on the wagon track two of their boys were in my outfit . You must try Mrs. Westcott 's nutbread , Celia , it 's great . " " Nut-bread , " said Celia , remembering the grin of Ricky Westcott . " That word is a signal , is n't it ? " " It is this week . Next week we 'll choose another . " " Like your fancy stockings . " Luke laughed as she told him about recognizing Hugo 's stockingsyesterday . " I 'm glad you 're on our side , Sassyface , " he said . " With your habit of noticing things , I 'd hate to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of me that evening . I did make the stockings on the track just as I told you , and after my first trip it occurred to me they could be used as a signal to my friends . But do you know , you were the first person who had ever asked me about them ? " Celia crossed her arms on the table before her , laughing too . " Who taught you to knit ? " she asked . " My father . His folks were Scots , and in Scotland men do n't think of knitting as a strictly feminine art , any more than tailoring . A lot of Scotsmen knit their own waistcoats and stockings . He taught me once when I fell out of a tree and was laid up with a bad leg . " " Were you very fond of him ? " Celia asked . Luke nodded . " He was grand . " He spoke so warmly that for a moment she felt the old chillyp303sense of lonesomeness . She wished she could remember her parents . Hurriedly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stockings mean when you wore them ? " she asked . " That I had supplies coming in , needed help to get them to my hiding-places , things like that . " " And how does Hugo use them now ? " " To say he has something to report . Like your basket in the window . " Luke brought one knee up under his chin and wrapped his arms about it . " Not many rebel women can afford Hugo these days . Nearly all his customers are friends of the king . You know how long it takes to give a lady a stylish coiffure . So they like to have their friends in , to drink tea and chat while he works , and the ladies are n't always careful what they say . Like your Mrs. Kirby . " Celia nodded . Luke added humorously , " Also , some of Hugo 's customers are not ladies in your sense of the word . They 're the girl friends of men like Tarleton and Balfour , and when they have other girls in they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke shrugged . " Those beauties sometimesdrink quite a lot during a hairdressing session . And while they drink , they talk . Hugo listens . " Celia spoke contritely . " I guess I 've misjudged Hugo too . I never thought he was a real patriot . " Luke 's bright sapphire eyes flashed reproachfully toward her . " Sassyface , Hugo is no real patriot . ' I do n't mean he 's a Tory  --  he 'd like to see us win the war . But Hugo never did any work in his life that he did n't get paid for . " Celia remembered the gold doubloons with which Darren had induced Hugo to take care of Jimmy . But she did not want to think about that . Again she brought herself back to the present . " Who pays him ? " " We have our friends , " said Luke . " Men like Godfrey . " He added with a short laugh , " And we do need them . I logo is n't the only one who wo n't work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blond hair and brown eyes , I like that . We 'd better figure out a few more signals for you . Must n't use the basket in the window too often . Can you think of any ? " " Yes , " she said , " I 've just thought of one . "  |p304She  spoke quickly . His remark about her hair had given her a twinge of strangeness . Her shock at Bellwood had been so stunning that she had felt washed out of life for good , and Luke 's words reminded her that she was still , in spite of Bellwood , a girl that a man could find pleasing . The reminder was a little bit frightening , like taking the first step after an illness . She hurried to answer his question . " I could give a signal with my cap-pin . I have several . One is a silver butterfly  --  I could change to the butterfly when I have something to report . It could n't be seen from the street , but Ida is having some kerchiefs made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she likes , to see which pin I 'm wearing . " " Not bad . Try the butterfly pin . " " And when Ida 's kerchiefs are made , " Celia said , " could we tell Madge to order something ? " Luke shook his head , laughing again . " Madge is no good at anythingsubtle . Just naturally too straightforward . " Celia understood . An affectionate , candid person , normal as a loaf of bread , Madge was not made for adventures . There was a tap at the door , and Darren came in . " Report 's on the way , " he announced blithely . Celia felt a shiver of pride . No doubt Madge was a happy woman , but Celia was glad she was not made that way herself . Darren was crossing the room , and as he came near she gave a cry of astonishment . " Darren ! " He stopped . " What 's the matter ? " She heard Luke laughing , but she did not look at him ; she was staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your limp  --  " Darren held his cane in his hand , but he had not put it to the floor since he came in . He laughed too , a little shamefacedly , and Luke said , " I told you she noticed everything . " With a sigh , Darren laid his cane on the table . " Miserable thing . Walking stiff-legged makes my knee so sore that I 'm likely to be really lame before this war 's over . Here in the Westcotts ' cellar I can walk naturally and it 's such a relief , I forgot you did n't know . " He sat down on the bench across from Celia and rubbed his aching knee . " But why do you pretend to be lame ? " she demanded . " To keep out of the king 's army , " Darren said mirthfully . " I 'm just what they want  --  healthy and under twenty-five , so since Clinton revoked the paroles I 'd either have to fight for old George or begin trouble . But I did get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scar to prove it . All right now , but if I say I 'm still lame they ca n't prove I 'm not . " They all laughed together . It was such a simple trick , and yet so effective that it gave them a feeling of triumph . It occurred to Celia that she had laughed more this morning than during the whole time since she came back to Charleston . Flexing his knee , Darren said , " I want to go with Marion , but they say I 'm more useful in town . Just a born errand boy , that 's me . " He and Luke went on to tell her more about the work they were doing and how they did it . How notes were hidden in cabbages , in the hair of farm girls who brought eggs to town , even in Mrs. Westcott 's fancy twists of bread . How Marion 's men slipped through the swamps with the silence they had learned in years of hunting there , sometimes coming so close to British camps that they could steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best swamp-dodgers was Amos . Most Britishers were not used to Negroes and knew very little about them . Amos could , whenever he felt like it , drop into a fieldhand dialect and give the impression that he did n't know nothin ' about nothin ' . Luke told her how a scout , hidden in a tree , would signal his comrades with a low soft whistle that could be heard for a remarkabledistance . Marion himself had devised the whist le . It was so much like a bird-call that only a trained ear could tell the difference . They talked and talked . They forgot the passage of time until they heard another tap on the door and in came Mr. Westcott , a round little plump fellow who evidently enjoyed his wife 's cooking . Mr. Westcott said " Howdy , ma'am , " to Celia. 1 le told them that there were several couples here now , in the ladies ' side of the tea-shop , and this would be a good time for Darren and Miss Celia to come up by the kitchen way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Luke told Celiap306that Mrs. Westcott made it a point to be proud of her kitchen . She invited the customers to come in whenever they pleased , to see how spick-and-span it was . Celia and Darren could go up the stairs , but instead of turning toward the refreshment rooms they would go to the kitchen . Celia would give the proper complimentson its neatness , then they would go into the tea-room and order some of Mrs. Westcott 's dainties . The kitchen visit would justify their coming into the tea-room by the back door . Leaving Luke in the cellar , Celia and Darren climbed the stairs again . The kitchen was dustless and gleaming , with big brick ovens watched over by maids in shiny white caps and aprons . The odors were so luscious that Celia did not wonder at the size of Mr. Wcstcott 's paunch . Another couple came in , a ruddy middle-aged pair , the housewife admiring the kitchen while her husband sniffed with appreciation . They all four went together from the kitchen to the tea-room . Several tables were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mrs. Leon Torrance , but they did not appear to see her . Observing the round innocent face of Leon Torrance , Celia thought again how much he looked like Sophie . She recalled that it must be about time for Sophie 's baby to be born . Probably that was why she was not in town , taking part in the gay life she enjoyed so much . Darren chose a table by a window , and Mrs. Westcott bustled over to serve them . The nut-bread was delicious.  |p307John  Cruden , the man in charge of confiscating rebel estateswent seriously about his work . Two days after Celia 's talk with Luke , Mr. Cruden chose the residence of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney , a rich American officer now a prisoner of war . Colonel Pinckney 's wife and children were told to go and live with any friends who would make room for them . Mr. Cruden let them have their clothes , but they had to leave everything else . The family moved out and Mr. Cruden moved in. 1-laving taken care of himself , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bright October and business was good . The town was full of people . Besides the Britishers , merchants from the West Indies were here to buy and sell ; men had come from the country to take orders for army supplies ; Tories had poured in from other colonies to reap the rewards of their Toryism . Day after day as she minded the parlor Celia listened to their talk , and she had never known there were so many ways to pronounce the English language . Some of the talk was heartbreaking . She heard of plantations confiscated by Cruden and sold for a fraction of their value to friends of the king . She heard that half the men in Washington 's army had no shoes , and winter on the way . She even heard that Cornwallis had started on his northward march.  | " Is it true , Luke ? " she asked despairingly , next time she saw him . Luke , however , was not concerned . " Yes , it 's true , " he said . He smiled as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere than to get there . You keep on listening . " So she kept on listening , and sometimes  --  not often , but sometimes  --  she heard items of real value , items that might help win the war . They had no more news of Cornwallis , but Luke kept his merry courage . " I do n't believe , " he said , " that Cornwallis will get far . In fact , " Luke went on serenely , " it would n't surprise me if we made things so tough that instead of his going north to help Clinton , Clinton should have to send more men south to help Cornwallis . " Celia gasped . " Oh Luke , we do n't want any more ! " " Oh yes we do , Sassyface , " he assured her . " We want all we can get . The more men here with Cornwallis , the less chance Clinton has to close in on General Washington . " He laughed so confidently that Celia laughed too . No matter how dismayed she might have been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then Luke was gone . Celia learned of his departure one morning . She had finished the last of Ida 's kerchiefs the day before , and Miss Loring had told her to deliver them after breakfast . The maid who answered the door led her upstairs to the little sitting room , where Ida told her Luke had left town . Ida said Ricky Westcott had come by yesterday to tell them . Ricky did not know when Luke had left ; he knew only that his father had sent him to say that Luke 's work in town was done , at least for the present , and he had slipped out in secret to rejoin Marion 's men . Before Celia had time to think about how much she was going to miss him , Ida was saying , " Now I have a surprise for you . A nice one . " As she spoke she crossed the room to the bedroom door . Celia heard her say , " You may come in now , " and through the doorway came Marietta . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran top309meet her and they hugged each other . " Oh , Miss Celia , " Marietta exclaimed , " I 'm so glad to see you ! " " When did you get here ? " Celia asked eagerly . " Last week . But Miss Ida said I 'd better not go to the shop to see you , I should wait till you came here . " " And what are you doing in town ? " Marietta glanced at Ida . " It 's all right to tell Miss Celia everything , is n't it ? " " Oh yes , " Ida said , " only keep your voices down , both of you . " She left them , saying she wanted to speak to the cook about dinner . Celia and Marietta sat side by side on the long chair . Marietta said Amos had come to Sea Garden several times , bringing letters to be passed on . He had told her about Marion 's men . Marietta wanted to help . She had felt so useless , polishing silver and arranging flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mean , " Celia said fervently . " So Miss Vivian said , if we could figure out some way for me - to come to town , I could work for Miss Ida , and do things to help Amos . " " How ? Oh never mind , we 'll come to that . First tell me how you got here . " Marietta said a redcoat troop had come by Eugene Lacy 's plantation some time ago , and had taken a lot of meat and fodder , and his best horses . They had given him one of those promissory notes in payment . But not only did Eugene Lacy have a son who had fought with the Continental Army and was now on the prison-ship in Charleston harbor , also Eugene himself had liven aid and comfort to the rebels whenever he could . He could not get a pass to come to Charleston and cash that note on Queen Street . However , since it was better to have a little money than no money at all , Eugene had asked his friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say he had a note that he would sell at a discount . " And Miss Celia , " said Marietta , " you 'll never guess who bought it . " Celia felt a tweak of misgiving . " Not my cousin Roy Garth ! "  | " That 's right , Miss Celia . He and Miss Sophie came by Sea Garden again , and asked if they could spend the night on theirway to Charleston . They have a baby boy now , did you know that ? Mr. Herbert told them about Mr. Eugene 's note , and Mr. Roy said he 'd be glad to oblige . He bought it for a very small discount , I do n't know how much but I know Mr. Eugene was surprised , he said he had n't expected any Tory to be so gen-erous . " Celia remembered what Herbert had said of Roy last summer . " No honest man needs to be that charming . " She wished she knew what Roy had in his mind . " So then what happened ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter-in-law Mrs. Bernard needed some extra help now that she had two officers staying in the house . She asked if they would take one of the maids from Sea Garden to Charleston with them . Mr. Roy said of course , glad to be of service . So I came to town on their boat . " " Now tell me what you do here , " said Celia . Marietta said Major Brace and Captain Woodley often had visits from other officers . Marietta brought them tea or drinks , came in to open or close the windows . They were not so careful of their talk around a colored housemaid as they were around Godfrey and Ida . Marietta helped hang out the laundry , on a clothesline that had been arranged so one end could be seen from the street . Ida had some kerchiefs with blue borders . If Godfrey had a message to send but could not take it himself without attracting attention , Marietta hung a blue-bordered kerchief at that end of the clothesline . " And as time goes on , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " Celia had heard all she said , but at the same time Celia herself was thinking of Roy . " Marietta , " she asked , " where are my cousins staying ? " " With Miss Sophie 's brother  --  Mr. Leon Torrance and his family . They 've got a big house on Church Street . " Celia felt uneasy ; she did not know why . She was of age now , there was nothing Roy could do to her  --  unless he found out shep311was a spy for Marion , and this was a risk she faced every day from everybody on the king 's side . The door of the sitting room burst open and Godfrey 's voice exclaimed " Ida ! " He stopped on the threshold . " Oh Celia , I 'm sorry  --  did n't know you were here . Where 's Ida ? " He spoke jerkily . Something was wrong . " Ida went out to the kitchen , " said Celia . " Godfrey , what  --  " " Marietta  --  please go and find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here . " Marietta gave him a glance of concern as she went out . Godfrey slammed the door and stood there , softly beating one fist on the palm of his other hand . Celia stood up . " Godfrey , shall I leave ? Do you want to speak to Ida alone ? " " No , it 's no secret . Everybody in town will be talking about it before night . " He ran his hand back over his hair , and took two or three breaths to steady himself . " Celia , " he asked , " did you ever hear of a man named Benedict Arnold ? " The way he spoke the name , it seemed to rattle around the room . Celia began , " I 'm not sure  --  I believe I have  --  " and Godfrey said shortly , " He 's commander of the fort at West Point . I mean he was . " " What 's happened ? " she exclaimed . Godfrey walked across the room to a window and stood lookingout . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wait till Ida gets here . Then I wo n't have to tell it more than once . " A moment later Ida arrived . Evidently Marietta had told her that something seemed amiss , for they were both out of breath from running up the stairs . Ida 's slight figure was tense with alarm . " Godfrey , what is it ? " she asked anxiously . She added , " Major Brace and Captain Woodley were hurrying out of the house so fast they did n't even see me as we passed in the hall . " " They want the details , " he said through his teeth , " hot and fresh . You need n't go , Marietta  --  might as well hear it now . " He sat down in the nearest chair . It was a little boudoir chair of French design , so slim and frivolous that it seemed to emphasize the heavy load of what he had to say . He told them Major-General Benedict Arnold was one of thep312most brilliant leaders in the American army . Arnold 's battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds . But he felt that his country had not given him the recognition he deserved . Brooding over his wrongs ( and his debts ) , he decided to sell his talents to the other side . He wrote secretly to Sir Henry Clinton . Arnold had a scheme . The British held the city of New York , but they had not been able to get control of the country above . Fifty miles north of New York , the fortress of West Point guarded the Hudson River valley . Clinton knew that if he could take this mighty stronghold he would have a good chance to surround Washington 's army , maybe even to end the war without waiting for Cornwallis to come up from the south . But without the troops of Cornwallis he was not strong enough to take it . Arnold knew this too . So he asked : What would the British give him , if he gave them West Point ? In delighted amazement , Clinton replied that they would give him almost anything he wanted . A vast sum of money , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the king might even make him a lord . Arnold set to work . Shortly after the fall of Charleston he asked General Washington to make him commander of West Point . He said one of his wounds was troubling him , and until his health improved he could serve his country better in the fort than on the battlefield . Because of Arnold 's valiant record Washington consented . When Arnold was quite ready , Clinton sent an officer , Major John Andre , to meet him . In the woods several ' miles from the fort , Arnold and Andre worked out details . On a certain day at a certain hour , the British were to move toward West Point . Arnold promised that just then the defenses would not be adequately manned . When the attack came , he would give vague and contradictory orders , confusing his men , scattering them so they could be easily picked off . Hundreds of Americans would be killed , the rest made prisoners , and the British would take the fort . Arnold gave Andre written plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But on the way he was captured andp313the papers were found . On the very day that the king 's men were to have taken West Point , Arnold fled to the shelter of a British man-of-war . Major Andre was executed as a spy . But Arnold was safe . The British gave him six thousand pounds in cash and made him a brigadier-general in the king 's army . They would have given him more if his plan had succeeded , but he got that much for trying . As Godfrey talked , once Celia thought she was going to burst into tears . Another time she thought she was going to throw up . She did not do either . She merely sat and stared at him . The others talked about it in shaky voices . Celia said she had better go . As she walked back to the shop the streets were buzzing with excitement . Groups of people stood about , talking , arguing , gesturing ; even housemaids leaned out of the windows talking to their friends on the sidewalk . Celia had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that for the first time since the army had occupied Charleston , she had gone through the street alone and not a single strange man had spoken to her . She would have liked to sit down quietly and calm her thoughts , but she could not . All she had time for was to throw some cold water on her face before she went back to work . She was about to take out her sewing when the door opened and Mrs. Kirby came in with Mrs. Sloan . Mrs. Kirby was chattering. " ... and do you know what Captain Cole said ? He said that 's what comes of making a major-general out of a horse trader . Yes , my dear , that 's what Mr. Arnold was before the war , a horse trader  --  oh Miss Garth , I know I 'm late for my appointment but so much has been happening I just could n't get here any sooner , do run up and tell Miss Perry I 've simply got to have my fittinb  --  " She sank into a chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility I have , I declare I 'm quite worn out  --  " Celia escaped . She arranged for Mrs. Kirby 's belated fitting . Rena Fairbanks , as usual escorted by a group of redcoats , came to order some gauze aprons . Rena went upstairs , the redcoats waited , and while they waited they talked about Benedict Arnold.  |p314All  day , everybody talked about Benedict Arnold . Some people laughed , some of them sneered . Some repeated Mrs. Kirby 's statement that Arnold had been a horse trader , others said he had been a peddler of drugs . But they agreed that he was common as pig-tracks , like most of the men who were leading the rebel army . They further agreed that Mr. Washington was a monster for having let Major Andre be executed . They said that although Arnold had not succeeded in giving up West Point , he knew all Washington 's plans and now would tell Clinton what he knew , and the American insurrection would be crushed in a month . Celia tried to remind herself that not everybody in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stricken as she was . But as Luke had reminded her , most of the patriot women had little money to spend ; they could not order clothes in a fashionable shop . She told herself this , but it did no good . The patriots were silent . All she could hear was the laughter of those who had yielded to the king . She wanted to sob , to scream , to order them out of here . Insteadshe sewed , she ran up and down the stairs , she smiled and curtsied , she said , " How do you do . Certainly , sir . Yes ma'am . No indeed , it 's no trouble at all . " Silently she prayed , " Please God , help me live through this day ! " That afternoon there was a shower . During the rain rio more customers came in , and by the time the sun appeared those who were already here had finished their business , so they went home . For a blessed few minutes the parlor was empty . Celia let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waistbandfor a gauze apron ; she wondered if the thing would be fit to wear . The room was close . Laying her work on the table she went to the nearest window and pushed up the sash . After the rain the air was clean and cold , and gave her a feeling of refreshment . It must be nearly closing time  --  maybe nobody else would come in today . But even as she thought this , she heard the front door open . She wet her lips , put on her professional smile , and looked around . As she did so she heard a little gasp of surprise . The customer was Sophie , and Sophie had seen her minding the parlor , and Sophie did not like it.  | " Why Celia , " cried Sophie , " I did n't know you were working here again ! " Her childish voice was shrill with astonishment . " Yes , " Celia said , still with her professional smile , " I 've been back some time now . " They met at the balustrade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birth of her baby her figure had regainedits soft young lines , and she was becomingly dressed in a fall costume of tan and dark green . Her neatly gloved little hands fluttered on the ledge of the balustrade . " But I thought , " she said  --  " I thought you were with Mrs. Lacy . " Keeping her voice as level as she could , Celia answered , " I could n't stay with Mrs. Lacy forever . " " But  --  " Sophie protested helplessly  --  " but she would have been so glad to have you ! " Celia 's hands , out of sight under the ledge , gripped each other . " Really , " she answered , " I 'd rather be independent . " " But working here  --  right out in public  --  meeting all sorts of people  --  oh Celia , it 's hardly right ! Nobody in our family would think of working in a public place  --  " Sophie paused plaintively . Celia wondered which really caused more trouble in the world , villains like Benedict Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak evenly , she said , " I 'm sorry you and I have the same name . But I wo n't tell anybody your husband is related to me . I promise . " " But people always  --  " Sophie began , and caught herself . She did not want to be so tactless as to say what she had almost said : People always find out embarrassing things like that . Her hands fluttered again , her eyelids quivered over her soft gray-blue eyes . She smiled hopefully . " Now do n't you worry . I 'm sure we can do something for you . Roy is so fond of you . he and I were talking about you last year , we wanted to do something for you then , but about that time we heard you were planning to be married  --  oh that was such a pity about Mr. Rand  --  but do n't you worry , I 'm sure we can  --  " Her voice fell off into an uncertain silence  --  probably , Celia thought , because she herself was looking as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm perfectly all right , thank you . I do n't need anybody to do something ' for me . I 'm earning my  --  "  |p316The  door opened again . Sophie turned around , plainly glad to have Celia 's speech interrupted , as she would not have known how to answer it . The newcomer was Sophie 's hostess and sister-in-law , Mrs. Torrance , who had paused on the front steps to speak to her husband . Celia heard a carriage drive off , and Mrs. Torrance said to Sophie that Leon would be back for them in a little while . Sophie exclaimed , " Oh Emily , you did n't tell me Celia Garth was working here ! " " We 've had so much else to talk about , " Mrs. Torrance said with a quick smile . Brushing the matter aside as if they could gain nothing by discussing it , she spoke to Celia with formal politeness . " We have no appointment , Miss Garth , but will you ask Miss Loring if we can see some nice soft muslins , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Certainly , Mrs. Torrance . Will you and Mrs. Garth sit down for a few minutes , please ? " She curtsied , and went toward the door to the staircase . Mrs. Torrance was several years older than Sophie and had two childrenof her own , so now she enjoyed giving Sophie some bigsisterlysupervision . Celia heard her saying that they outgrew their baby-clothes so fast , you simply had to have a few more things made for them right away . Celia went upstairs , told Miss Loring what the ladies wanted , and came back to tell them they could go up now . She opened the gate in the balustrade and then the door to the staircase . They went through and she closed the door after them . For a moment she stood with her hand on the doorknob , thinking . Sophie was such a buttercup of a child , though she was a grown woman , a wife and mother . It was puzzling . Celia had been told that the experiences of love and motherhood were tremendous . And yet Sophie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day , had had all this , but still seemed to have experienced nothing at all . Right now she was too tired to try to understand it . She pressed her hands to her head . She did not often have headaches , but now she had one , a dull weary feeling more like a heaviness in her head than like actual pain . She thought of Sophie 's words . " I 'm sure we can do something for you ... "  |p317Anybody  hearing her , Celia reflected , would think I was a puppy sitting up on my hind legs begging . I do n't want anything of Sophie or Roy or the Torrances . All I want is for them to let me alone . Her head felt as if she were carrying a rock in it . She could not help feeling that they were not going to let her alone.  |p318DURING  the next few weeks Sophie came into the shop several times . But she was always accompanied by Emily Torranceor some other friend , and she followed Emily 's example of addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit she made no more personal remarks . Sometimes Leon Torrance came in with them , but Celia did not see Roy at all . From their conversations she gathered that Roy was busy elsewhere , running British errands . He seemed to be doing a lot of traveling these days . Celia went on with the work Luke had told her to do . He had warned her that it would not be fun . He was right . It was n't . Now that the first excitement was over , she found that spying was a hard and thankless job . She had to be alert for a thousand trifles before she found one that might be of any use . When she found it she had to use all her wits to report it without being observed . And while she was doing this she also had to do her day 's work ; she had to be quick and obliging and sweet , though her legs ached and the customers often made unreasonable demands , especially the new-rich Tories who were not used to the heady sensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways . She passed them to Ida , Godfrey , Darren , the Westcotts . How any note went out ofp319town , or if it went out at all , or if it did any good , she never knew . Now and then she would hear of a skirmish , but she had no idea if she had had anything to do with it , or even if the report was true . In general , people in Charleston did not know much about what happened out of town . The Gazette published only what Balfour wanted them to read . But in November , they got a piece of news that Balfour had done his best to keep from them . The rebels of the Upcountry had won a resounding victory . At Kings Mountain on the line between the two Carolinas , they had defeated a crack Tory troop led by a British colonel . And Luke 's prediction turned out to be right : Cornwallis had hastily reversed his northward march and had brought his army back to South Carolina . The news of Kings Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Negro servant of John Rutledge , the exiled rebel governor of South Carolina . Godfrey was too shrewd to rejoice openly , but Burton invited his rebel friends to a dinner-party . In the shop , behind her sweet professional smile , Celia was thinking how mad Colonel Balfour must be . From what she had heard of him , she guessed that he was drowning his wrath in a bottle . She hoped that tomorrow morning his head would hurt terribly . Perhaps it did , but his temper hurt worse . Balfour could not take away knowledge of Kings Mountain from the Charleston rebels , but he could punish them for knowing . A squad of redcoatsknocked at the door of the house on Meeting Street and told Burton that he was under arrest and would be shipped to St. Augustine . At the same time , other squads of redcoats were at the doors of some twenty-odd other prominent men who had not taken the king 's oath , telling them that they also would be shipped to St. Augustine . The men were marched through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two days later the ship sailed . The next time Celia saw Darren , he told her that Cruden had confiscated Burton 's plantation and sold it for almost nothing to a deserving Tory . Cruden had not taken the Meeting Street house , possibly because it was not grand enough to he tempting . So Elise and her children still had a home , and Godfrey would see to it that they did not lack anything they needed.  |p320There  were now sixty exiles in St. Augustine , all of them leadingmen of South Carolina who had refused to take the king 's oath . At first Celia was distressed that Burton had to be one of them . But as she thought it over she felt sure that he was not distressed about himself . Burton was a yes-or-no man ; he was simply not capable of leading a double life , as Godfrey was doingnow . Burton had always tried to do the right thing , and this time he had no doubt about what the right thing was . He had the approval of the best people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be miserable . After Kings Mountain , Balfour tried to keep Charleston shut up tighter than ever . But as long as food had to come in , he could not keep out all the rebel news , nor even all the rebels themselves . So it happened that on a Sunday morning shortly after breakfast , the maid came to tell Celia that Mr. Darren Bernard had called , and wanted her to walk with him to the tea-shop . When they reached the tea-shop they found Godfrey and Ida already there . Mrs. Westcott told them Luke had slipped in last night from a fishing-boat . She said he had a grand tale to tell . She led them down to the muffled room , where Luke had just finished a breakfast of hominy and fresh mackerel and hot butteredraisin rolls . Beside him on the table stood Vivian 's hourglass and a lighted candle . Mrs. Westcott took the tray and went upstairs , while the others gathered around Luke to hear his story . Luke strode up and down , talking with big vivid gestures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was talking about General Marion . Yes , general now , he said , no longer colonel . From his hiding-place in North Carolina , Governor Rutledge had sent couriers to both Sumter and Marion , bringing them commissions as brigadier-generals . " Here in the Carolina Lowcountry , " said Luke , " we swampdodgershave been making pests of ourselves . We pop out of the swamp , we attack , we disappear . Tarleton hollers that we wo n't fight like gentlemen . ' I suppose he 's right . Tarleton went to Oxford , and most of us are not gentlemen in his sense of the word . Quite a few of us ca n't read Latin . To tell the truth , quite a fewp321of us ca n't read English . But every man of us can shoot the eye out of a squirrel at the top of a pine tree . " Luke 's eye caught Celia 's , and he grinned . Thrusting his hands into his pockets he said to her , " The swamp-dodgers have a proverb . They say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground within shootin ' distance of where he stands . ' And that 's just about the way it is . " Celia laughed , and Luke went on . " Well , as you know , Cornwallis left Camden and started north to meet the troops Clinton was sending south . But the word had gone out  --  delay him , make the going hard . His men were sniped at from behind the fences . Boys and girls went out with hatchets and chopped up the road signs , or sometimes turned them around so the men went miles in the wrong direction and had to march back and start over . " They had trouble getting food . In that country above Camden , Tarleton and Wemyss had been busy in ways you already know about . People who still had corn , or meat animals , burned the corn and killed and buried the animals , to keep Cornwallis from getting them . And behind him , we were attacking the wagon trains that were bringing supplies for his men . " Then those heroes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened , Cornwallis had been on the march a month and he had gone only fifteen miles past the South Carolina border . He brought his army back as fast as he could . " When he got settled in camp he had still more reports on Marion 's men . He decided Marion had to be captured . I Ic sent an order to Tarleton . " Tarleton was aching for glory . He 's ambitious and extravagant and he has a pile of gambling debts . When Cornwallis told him to get Marion , he was delighted . " I do n't know where Tarleton was when he got the order . But the main body of his legion was at Camden . I le was in such a hurry to get after Marion that he would n't wait for the legion  --  he sent them word that he was riding toward the Santee River and they were to catch up with him . Fie set out with a few horsemen and rode toward Nelson 's Ferry . " Marion got word from his informers  --  do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They told him Tarleton had set out with a small escort . We had about five hundred men , and Marion figured that if we could meet Tarleton before his legion caught up with him , we could make him prisoner . So we got orders to ride towardNelson 's Ferry . " We rode hard . The night of November tenth  --  it was a Friday , I 'll never forget it  --  we had had a long day 's ride and were mighty glad when Marion told us to halt . We were in a grove near a plantation owned by a rebel officer named Richardson . " While we were making camp , Marion saw a glow on the sky over toward the Richardson place . He told a guard to see what was on fire . Pretty soon the man came back with Colonel Richardson  --  he'dbeen home sick and was barely strong enough to walk . " Colonel Richardson said Tarleton 's men must have caught up with him some time during that day . He said Tarleton and the whole force had come riding down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were looking for Marion , but when Tarleton saw a rich-looking country house ripe for looting , he could n't resist it . " The men stormed through , helping themselves to whatever they wanted . They even dug up the dead body of Colonel Richardson'sfather , to see if anything worth stealing had been buried in his grave . When they had taken as much as they could carry they started the fires . The glare of the burning was what Marion had seen on the sky . " Now that Tarleton had his legion with him , Colonel Richardsonsaid we were outnumbered two or three to one , and also they had brought along a pair of cannon . We 've got no field-pieces . And what was most heartbreaking  --  Colonel Richardson said we had an Arnold right along with us . One of our men had deserted to Tarleton and had told him where we were camped that night . " There just one thing for us to do . We had to move fast . " So we did . We went through a swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through again in the black slimy dark of a night in November . Six miles of it that night , and we 'd already had a hard day . We sloshed on till we had passed a mill-dam on a little branch called Jack 's Creek  --  that 's around the bend of the Santee , upstream from Nelson 's Ferry.  | " But Marion knew exactly what he was doing . At the end of that six miles , he had put a bad swamp and a millpond between us and Tarleton . We had come to some big trees on high dry ground . He let us stop here , to eat whatever we had in our saddlebags  --  mostlycold roasted sweet potatoes  --  and fall down for some sleep . " Luke let out a tired-sounding sigh , as if remembering his own exhaustion after that night 's escape . He went on . " Tarleton sent some fellows to spy out our campsite . They came back and reported that we were n't there any more . " They did n't have any trouble seeing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a hurry that we had left a clear trail . Tarleton ordered his men to their horses and they set out after us . " Marion expected Tarleton to follow . We were sleeping like pigs , but it seemed like no time at all before he was waking us up . I had time to eat half a sweet potato while my horse got some grass , and that was all before we were moving again . " Marion led us . It was broad daylight now , but under the trees where we were there was hardly enough sun to make shadows . Just that green swamp twilight . Do you know that country ?  --  cypress trees hung with moss like gray curtains , vines thick as tree-trunks growing from tree to tree , swamp-water black from the cypress drippings . All around us birds and butterflies and a million flying things biting our faces and getting into our eyes , and little animals scurrying under the brush and sometimes an alligator in the water . Everything teeming with life , and yet there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get lost . " We went on and on , splashing through water or picking our way along the ridges , our horses so tired they could hardly move , ourselves slapping and scratching and sweating and shivering and too tired even to complain . Marion was leading us northeast , toward the Black River . We rode , we stopped and cut the way through , we mounted again and kept riding . We had no stops to eat or sleep . You munched what you had , as you rode . When you could n't stay awake any longer you fell out for some sleep . When a man fell out nobody waited for him . The rest kept going , and he had to catch up when he could . " We rode to the river . Then we rode downstream.  | " Tarleton was right behind us . Every now and then Marion would tell one of us to climb a tree , and wait there to see what could be seen , and come down and catch up and report . So we knew . Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep up . They straggled at a distance , following our trail . Tarletonwas so close that his foremost men were making prisoners of our hindmost . " Some of the men did n't want to keep moving . Miles Rand , and other men who had had experiences like his . They wanted a battle . They wanted to get at Tarleton right now , tear him to pieces . But Marion kept his head , like always . He expected a battle , but he wanted to choose the place . " And he had chosen it  --  I know that country pretty well , and it was plain where he was leading us . Benbow 's Ferry . Ten miles above Kingstree . Right there , the swamp meets the river , then there 's some safe high ground . It 's the only spot for miles where you can cross the river safely . Once we got there , we could turn and make a stand on the high ground , and we would have command of the crossing . Since we had to meet a force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have a fighting chance . " We had left Richardson 's place on a Friday night , and now it was Sunday . For a while we 'd been riding along fairly dry ground . Now we came to another bog , about ten miles above Benbow 's Ferry . Folks thereabouts call it Ox Swamp . It 's a mess of mud . Wide and miry , trees growing thick in the water . " Marion sent for me , and several other fellows who had been with him long enough to be well trained in his ways . He told us he could lead the men around the swamp , but it would take longer . He was going to lead them straight through . " He wanted us to stay behind , to see if Tarleton went through the swamp or around it . As soon as we made sure , we were to catch up and report , so he could know how much time he had to set up his defenses . He was leaving several of us as lookouts so if one man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that another man would get through . " So he left us . We each chose a tree , and climbed up and waited . " It was bright sunshiny fall weather . I had picked a big treep325with moss hanging around me like a tent . Before long , I saw Tarleton 's Legion . And Tarleton . " They were an impressive lot . Tired as we were and spattered with mud , but still a great array . Fine men , fine horses , fine weapons . " And a fine leader . Tarleton 's a good-looking man , green coat and white breeches and knee-high boots , and on his head a tall hat with black plumes  --  a shako , they call it . " They were coming over the dry ground where we had crossed a little while before . They were riding right in our tracks , Tarletonat the head of them . And there I sat in the tree , almost scared to breathe , waiting to see which way he would lead them . " They came near . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to where the bad mire set in . He reined his horse , looked around . The leaders of his troop rode up . They all looked at that mess in front of them . " Tarleton knew Marion 's men had just been there . If Marion could get past the swamp , Tarleton could get past it too . " The men were waiting for orders . Up in those trees , we were waiting . Tarleton rode a few yards in one direction , then in the other , and back again . Then all of a sudden he stopped with a sort of disgusted snort , he wheeled his horse and shouted his order . He said , " Go back ! We can find that gamecock Sumter , but as for this damned swamp fox , the devil himself could n't catch him . ' " Luke stopped . His hearers burst out laughing . " Swamp fox ! " said Godfrey . " Swamp fox ! " said Celia . They all said it , merrily , with appreciation . Celia was thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did thank him for inventing so apt a name . Marion the Swamp Fox . " And he really turned back ? " she said . " So close ! " Luke smiled and shrugged . " He did . I saw hint . Ile quit , and rode up toward Camden to look for General Sumter . " Godfrey gave an exclamation . The sand had run out . It was time for church . He and Ida had been so dutiful about attending and affecting to join in the prayers for the king , that they didp326not want to stay away now . Ida drew her cloak around her , laughing softly as she said , " And today we really have something to thank the Lord for . " They went out , and Luke told Darren to bring some pens and paper . Tarleton 's unsuccessful chase of Marion had been noised all over the country outside Charleston , and now , to spread the the story in town , Luke said he would write a summary that could be quickly read . Darren and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these around to other friends of Marion who would make more . Tonight  --  or rather , early tomorrowmorning  --  all these copies would be posted on walls and fences about town . They would be put up by people whose businesstook them out before dawn : a fisherman going to his boat , a doctor on the way to a patient ; an old woman who kept hens , delivering eggs for breakfast . Of course the redcoat guards would pull down the notices as fast as they saw them , but no matter . The tale of the Swamp Fox would be out . When the papers were ready Darren went to distribute them , telling Celia that when he came back they would go to the refreshment room . " Mrs. Westcott 's making crackling-bread today , " he said . As the door closed Celia smiled happily up at Luke . He stood by her , resting one hand on the table . " I feel so much better than I did , " she told him . " Has it been hard going ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so tired . Ever since that business about Benedict Arnold . " Looking down at her , Luke smiled slowly . For a moment he did not answer . With his rough homespun clothes and thick boots , his face so weatherbeaten that his skin was darker than his hair , his bright blue eyes full of devilment , Luke looked like an embodiment of all he had been telling her . She thought of Marion 's men , tough and fighting mad , living on sweet potatoes and water , slogginginto battle with two rounds of ammunition apiece , and many a man with not even a gun until some other man  --  friend or enemy  --  dropped and he could grab the gun from the falling hands . Such men had to have the kind of strength she saw in Luke.  |p327They  had to have absolute faith , like his , in the rightness of their cause . They could not do what they were doing if they had had anything less . She had spoken of Arnold . With his untroubled grin , Luke answered , " Celia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , It 's all over . ' After Camden they said , It 's all over . ' After Arnold the same . And it 's not over yet . " " I wish you had been here the day we got the news , " she said , " to tell me something like that . I 've never had such a day . " She told him what it had been like , the sneers and shrugs and Tory laughter . " And then that little fool Sophie , gabbling that she wanted to do something ' for me ! I suppose she 'd like to have me move into her house and do her dressmaking for nothing , instead of disgracing her by working for wages in a shop . " Celia gave a shiver . Luke 's big rugged hand dropped on her shoulder . " My dear , " he said in a low voice , " I ca n't protect you from the sneers , I ca n't protect you from fools and Tories  --  how I wish I could . " His hand closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifted her up to meet him as he bent forward and kissed her . Celia was so taken by surprise that for an instant she made no response at all , either of yes or no . But then her back stiffened and she pushed herself away from him , violently exclaiming , " No , Luke , no ! Do n't do that ! " He still held her . " Why not ? " he asked simply . " Because  --  " With an effort Celia pulled one arm free , and put up her elbow in front of her face . " Because I do n't want you to ! Not you or anybody  --  after Jimmy  --  " " Oh , bosh , " said Luke . His hands closed on her as before . 1Ic kissed her again , hard and almost ' roughly , and let her go . ' Faking a step back from her , he spoke . " There . I did n't want to fall in love with you ! But I knew I could n't help it if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood looking down . His big heavy-shod foot kicked at a seam of the canvas that covered the floor . Celia stood where she was . She was astounded . Luke had never , by any word or gesture , indicated that he might be in love withp328her . On the contrary , his manner toward her had been studiedly casual . As for herself , she had thought she was through with love . She felt now that she wanted to be through with it , she did not want Luke or any other man to come near her . After a moment to catch her breath she said shortly , " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " At the sound of her voice Luke turned around and faced her . " I 'm talking about you , dear , " he retorted , " and about me . Everybody wanted you to work with us  --  Mother , Godfrey , even Hugo said , Miss Garth has got the nerve , I have seen it . ' But me  --  I wanted you too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want you for the same reason . I knew I 'd get into trouble  --  and I did . " Luke gave a mighty sigh . Celia did not know how to answer . The way he spoke was so different from the way he had ever spoken to her , and so different from the way she had ever heard anybody talk . She stood twisting her hands together , hearing him and not understanding him , and he seemed still more strange when he said , " You see  --  the fact is , I 've been in love with you ever since I 've known you . " This at least she could answer . " Oh no you were not ! " she exclaimed . " When I first worked for Vivian you could have seen me any time you pleased and you ignored me utterly . That does n't seem like love  --  " " It was , though , " he said . But she rushed on . " When you found I was engaged to Jimmy  --  that night of the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear girl , " said Luke , " I was delighted . I thought I was getting rid of you . " At her gasp of shock he laughed , softly and with a sound of pleasure . " Maybe , " he said , " you were slightly in love with me too , right from the start , or you would n't have been so conscious that I was avoiding you  --  a man you 'd never seen but once in your life . " Now she was getting angry . " What do you mean ? " she demanded.  | " I 'm trying to tell you , " Luke said patiently . " The first time I met you , I liked you . There was a communication between us -- a sort of deep calleth unto deep , ' as the Bible says in another sense . Remember ? " She did remember . He had been so easy to talk to . Luke was saying , " When I left you I thought , Now there 's a girl  --  and right away my common sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorched you like this  --  let go , before you get burned by the real fire . " The tone of his voice changed . It became earnest , almost pleading . " Ca n't you understand that , Celia ? I was doing one of the most dangerous jobs of the war . There was n't any room in my mind for a girl  --  " " Oh yes there was , " said Celia . " That first evening I thought , He 's got a girl in every town between Charleston and Philadelphia . And I still think so . " " Oh no , " Luke protested , " not every town . " He took a step toward her , and stopped . " My dear , if you do n't know the difference between girls and a girl , you know even less about love than I thought you did . " Celia spoke with a breathless anger . " What are you  --  " But Luke had not paused . " Of course , you were not in love with Jimmy  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you say I did n't love Jimmy ? " For a moment Luke did not answer . She felt his strong direct gaze , and when he spoke there was a quiet wisdom in his voice . " You loved him , Celia . But you were not in love with him . There 's a difference . " Celia 's throat felt as if she had a marble in it . Shc wanted to scream at him , and tell him again to stop this , but she could not . She could not say anything . His bright eyes held her and she had to hear what he was saying . " You loved Jimmy , yes . You loved his mother , and Miles , and you loved the feeling that they loved you . Nothing wrong withp330that . Plenty of women settle for less . But my dear  --  " again he spoke earnestly , in a low voice  --  " that 's not being in love with a man . " With a great effort Celia managed to free her voice . " Stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As she spoke she ran to the curtain that covered the door . She started to draw it aside , but she felt him gripping her elbows , forcing her to turn around and face him . " Do n't be a fool , " he said shortly . " Do you want to put us all in that lockup under the Exchange ? Do n't go blundering out of here till you know it 's safe . " Celia was trembling with rage . " Let go of me ! " He did not obey . His hands were so tight that he hurt her . " Keep your voice down , " he ordered . " And listen . Do n't leave this room till Darren comes here to get you . I 'll leave . Is that what you want ? " Celia wished he would stop looking at her . He had such vitality that his eyes seemed to shine at her with a light of their own . " Yes , yes , " she said breathlessly . " Go away . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . About love . " Luke began to laugh . " All right , Sassyface . I 'll leave you now . But one of these days I 'm going to teach you what I mean about love , whether you like it or not . " He let go of her , and with one hand he swept aside the curtain that hid the door . Celia stood rubbing her elbows , trying to ease the ache of his grip . Over his shoulder Luke grinned down at her . " And my darling , " he said softly , " you 'll like it . "  |p331Now  Celia was so confused that she hardly knew what was happening around her . Day after day she went through her routine in the shop , almost without thinking about it . She tried to listen as before , and pick up hints that might be of use to Marion 's men . But after a minute or two she found her mind back where it had been , concerned with herself , and with Luke . He says he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with him from the first . He says I was not in love with Jimmy . What does he mean ? Jimmy was so warm and strong ! I knew I could count on him . I loved him . ButBut Luke was talking about something different . She tried to be practical . It would be easy to say , " Why yes , Luke , if this crazy talk means you 're asking me to marry you , I 'll be glad to do it . Any girl as poor as I am would grab the chance to marry into a rich family like yours . " Of course she would say it in prettier words than this . But these days there was no counting on wealth . Look at what had happened to General Sumter , to Burton , to hundreds of other rich men . No matter who won the war , at the end of it Luke might not have a penny . Or she might say , " Yes , yes ! I 'll take you rich or poor . Any/thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But she knew she was not really in danger of turning into a dried-up crosspatch . Now that she no longer felt the hopeless despair with which she had come back to the shop , Celia knew that here she did have a future . She had proved that she could become a famous dressmaker . She could be a woman with a career , proud of herself . No , she had no reason to pay attention to Luke . No reason at all . Unless she was in love with him . There she was , back where she had started . Day after day her mind followed the same circle . She would sit behind the parlor balustrade , sewing and thinking , until her thoughts were cut by a peevish voice . " Miss Garth ! Ca n't you hear me ? Please open the gate ! " Celia would spring up , saying , " Oh , I 'm so sorry , do come in . " But as soon as she went back to her sewing the circle of her thoughts would start again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were signs of it all around her . Luke had done his work so well that now the spy system reached every corner of town . Marion 's helpers were rich men , laborers , tavern maids , peddlers calling shrimp and oysters in the street . They gathered information , they passed notes , or they engaged the attention of the British guards so other people could do so . More items about Marion 's men were posted in the night , to be read in the morning . Gradually , to redcoats and rebels alike , Marion was becoming a figure of legend , a ghostly hero who came out of nowhere and went back into nothing . But to Celia , this seemed to be no concern of hers any more . Always she was thinking , Luke may be back any time . What am I going to say to him ? Ida sent Marietta over one day with an invitation to supper . After supper , when they gathered in Ida 's little sitting room , Godfrey said , " We were getting worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celia said with Christmas so near , the shop had such a rush ofbusiness that she had hardly five minutes at a time to sit andlisten for what the customers might say . " I 'm sorry , " she added . She felt guilty . She felt even more guilty when Godfrey urged ,  | " Do n't apologize ! That was n't what I meant . You 're doing a great job . " Ida said she had thought of a new way to pass the next note across the balustrade . She would write to the shop ordering five yards of pink ribbon , and would ask them to have the package ready so that she could have a maid pick it up . Little packages like this were customarily put into a drawer of Celia 's worktable . Next time Celia had a note to send out , Ida continued , she was to give a signal by way of the window . Marietta would come in to ask for the ribbon , and Celia could hand the package and note together across the balustrade . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ida . Now in winter the parlor windows were kept closed , so the signal must be one that could be seen through the pane . Celia had alreadyused the special draping of the curtains . Celia said she would try to think of a new signal . She bit her lip , telling herself that she must keep her mind on Marion and not on Luke , or she would have no more notes to pass . Godfrey and Ida walked with her back toward the shop . They had not gone far before they sensed an unusual excitement around them . It was a chilly evening when you would expect people to be more comfortable indoors than out , but the streets were crowded . Men stood in groups , talking angrily . The redcoat patrols were telling them to move on and not block the sidewalk , but as soon as one group broke up , another began to cluster near by . A little way past the home of old Simon Dale on Meeting Street , Celia caught sight of Mr. Dale himself . Striking his cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own age that this was an outrage , sir , an outrage , and he 'd gladly say so to the king himself . Godfrey paused to ask what had happened . Simon Dale gave a growl . Speaking so vehemently that his breath was like the smoke of cannon in front of him , he exclaimed that he hardly liked to discuss this matter in the presence of ladies . That 's how disgraceful it was . Ida took Celia 's hand and drew her gently back into the shadows . Pretending to think that only Godfrey could hear him now , Simon sputtered out the stoic . Celia had felt inclined to giggle , but as she listened she felt like that no longer.  |p334Simon  said Balfour had ordered the arrest of two women of good reputation  --  unmarried sisters , named Sarazen  --  and had put them into that dungeon under the Exchange . The Misses Sarazen had been told that they were suspected of sending out rebel information . They had not been told who accused them , nor what information they were supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that had happened was that a few hours ago a redcoatparty had appeared at their home , and the leader had told them they were under arrest . They were led through the street to the Exchange , and locked up in the vault with the criminals . This vault was called the Provost . It was the only place where criminals were kept nowadays , for the town jail was being used as a barracks for British soldiers . The Provost was a stone-walled room , damp and almost airless , crawling with vermin . The place was already jammed with fifty-six human beings . These were men and women , white persons and Negroes ; they were killers , drunkards , prostitutes , street-brawlers , some of them suffering from loathsome diseases . There was no separation by sex , day or night . There was no privacy at all , not even for what Simon Dale referred to as " calls of nature . " As he talked , Simon nearly choked with fury . He said he knew the Misses Sarazen . They were ladies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lady . Also , said Simon , the fact that the Sarazen sisters had never been married made the whole businesseven more of an insult . It was an insult , he added , to every decent woman in town . Celia felt Ida pressing closer to her . Ida carried a fur muff ; she took Celia 's hand and drew it into the muff and held it , as though for security . Celia returned the grasp . They were both trembling with the thought , This could have happened to me . " Now , now , good people , " said a tired young voice with a British accent . " Walk on , do n't crowd . " " Very well , " said Godfrey , and turning to Simon Dale he said good night . By the glow of the street-light Celia saw his face . Godfrey looked sick . He too was thinking , It could have happened to anybody . To my friends . To my wife . Simon Dale was right , thought Celia . It 's an insult to every decent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about the affair of the Sarazens . People on both sides were shocked . They said it was just about what you would expect of Balfour . Balfour knew  --  how could he help knowing ?  --  that rebel news had been going out of Charleston . But they said , and had been saying for a long time , that he was too drunk and lazy to carry through an efficient plan of stopping it . His guards had arrested a few boys posting news on fences , a few fishermen smuggling notes written by other people . These fellows were usually thrown into the dungeon until they paid a fine . This procedure , no matter how often repeated , did nothing to dig up the roots of the spy system . The rebels had scoffed at Balfour . So had some of his own subordinate officers in Charleston . Many of these men had given years of real service to their country , and they did not enjoy taking orders from a fellow who had used Balfour 's methods of getting ahead . Prodded to do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to throw the Misses Sarazen into the dungeon . People in general agreed with Simon Dale that he had chosen them because he thought the indecencies there would be especially painful to women used to living in maiden isolation . Balfour 's own officers waited on him with such violent protests that after three or four days the Sarazen sisters were allowed to go home . They were besieged by visitors . Some of these were busybodies panting to hear a sensational tale , others were genuine friends . In their state of distraction the sisters could not tell the difference . They locked their door , and refused to discuss their days and nights in the dungeon . What had happened to them there , nobody ever knew . Nothing was proved against them . This might have been because there was nothing to prove , or because the British aut puritieswere so eager to forget the episode that they did not try . After her first shock , Celia found that she was not so much scared as she was just plain mad . She felt a burning defiance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was thinking of something besides Luke . She was wondering , Does Balfour think this is the way to stop us ? I 'll show him . She found herself again keeping her ears alert . With no effortp336at all , she thought of a new signal she could give from the side window . Because of the gloomy weather she suggested to Mrs. Thorley that they brighten the parlor with some potted ferns . Mrs. Thorley said it was a good idea , and Celia then suggested that the pots be of different colors , such as red and yellow and white . When she saw Darren again she told him that next time she had a message to send she would put the white-potted fern at the window . The white pot could be easily seen through the glass . She felt refreshed , glad she was back on the job . In spite of the rush of business she managed to listen . December ended , the year 1781 began , and in January her attention was rewarded . She heard Mrs. Hendrix bragging to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately , collecting wagons to take barrels of gunpowder up to Camden . Mrs. Hendrix had a great deal to say about her husband 's importance in this matter . Celia guessed that all he had done was guide some British officers to plantations where they would find the sort of wagons they needed , so the British could take these and give the owners promissory notes , which Mr. Hendrix would then buy at a discount . Many Tories did this . They were most helpful , leading the way to supplies of all kinds . Naturally they took care to recommend that supplies be bought from people who for one reason or another could not come to town to cash the notes for themselves . However , this did not matter right now . What did matter was that in the course of her bragging Mrs. Hendrix clearly said the wagons were gathering at Dorchester , and would start very soon unless it rained again . Celia thought it was likely to rain again , for the winter so far had been a mushy one and she saw no sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagons would start . Meanwhile , some bright fellow could be sent to Dorchester to keep an eye on them . Now at last after her weeks of uselessness she had something to report . Everything went well . She thought of a new excuse to get up to the bedroom alone and write her message . Putting some woodp337on the parlor fire , she smudged her arm ; raising her arm to push back a lock of hair , she wiped the smudge on her nose . So she had to step out and ask that somebody take her place while she went up to get washed . When she came down she had her note in her pocket . As soon as she had a minute alone she took hold of the stand holding the fern in the white pot , and moved it to the window . Before anyonecame in she had returned to her sewing . She waited serenely . Odd to remember how jittery she had been about this at first . All she felt now was a cool triumph . Balfour thinks he can scare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . Curtsying politely , she said to Celia that she had come to pick up a package of ribbon for Mrs. Bernard . According to plan , Celia handed her the package and the note together . Marietta went out . She would deliver the note to Godfrey , who would start the news on its way . Celia had learned by now that many of her messages were passed by a certain bartender at a tavern on the highway . As Marietta went out , Mrs. Baxter came in . Celia smiled at her pleasantly , and Mrs. Baxter said she wanted to order some gloves . The shop continued to be busy . Celia had expected a quiet period after the turn of the year , but there was none ; trade at the port was good , so the Tories had money and were spending it . Celiaan up and down the stairs until she thought her leg-muscles must be as hard as those of an infantry soldier . On a Sunday morning late in January she decided to rest by staying in bed . Becky and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for the day with their boy-friends ; and Becky brought Celia the glass of milk that had stood by her plate . Celia drank it gratefully and lay down again . She had a restful morning , dozing and reading . It was nearly noon when a maid knocked on the door and gave her a note . The maid said the boy who brought it was waiting for an answer . The note was signed " Sarah Westcott . " Mrs. Westcott asked Celia to be her guest at a little private luncheon today . She said Ricky , who delivered the note , would walk with her to the tea-shop.  |p338As  soon as she saw the signature Celia 's heart began to thump . Sunday was the Westcotts ' busiest day . Mrs. Westcott had no time for a little private luncheon . This was a summons . Luke must be here . Her heart thumped harder , and it seemed to be up in her throat instead of in her chest where it ought to be . She wet her lips . Trying to speak to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to go out , she said , " Tell the boy I 'll be down in a few minutes . " With Ricky , she walked uptown toward Cumberland Street . It was a silent walk , for she could not talk about Luke and she could not think about anything else . Ricky led her to the family living quarters at the back of the shop , and saying , " I 'll call my mother , " he left her there . When Mrs. Westcott came in , she laid a warning finger on her own lips . Silently she led the way along the back passage , and pointed down the cellar stairs . Celia nodded , and Mrs. Westcott bustled back to her customers . Celia crept down the dark staircase and felt her way to the door of the muffled room . Here she paused . Her mouth felt dry . Luke was there , on the other side of that door , she was sure of it . He was going to remind her of what he had said . Six weeks ago  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she had not . She was scared . It was a strange sort of scaredness , not the way she would have felt if she had heard somebody tiptoeing behind her on a dark street . Not that , but  --  what ? She did not know . She thought , I 've got to go in , I 've got to speak to him , answer him , I 've got toThe door opened and two imperative hands grasped her and pulled her in between the curtains , and his voice said roughly , " Thank God you 're here ! I 've never been so worried in my life  --  tell me , Celia , are you all right ? " One hand still gripping her shoulder , with his other hand Luke pulled the door shut and dropped the curtain across it . All Celia could think at the moment was that with Luke , nothing was ever the way you thought it was going to be . In a voice thin with astonishment she answered , " Of course I 'm all right ! What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , where stood the hourglass andp339a candle . He struck the table with his fist , so hard that the shadows leaped crazily around the room . " You little fool , " he burst out , " what made you send that message about the wagons at Dor-chester ? " Celia 's knees felt weak . She made her way toward him and grasped the table with both hands . " Oh good heavens  --  did I make trouble ? Were n't the wagons there ? " " Oh yes , yes , the wagons were there  --  but Celia , you half-wit , you reckless imbecile  --  what made you send any message at all ? After what happened to those Sarazen women  --  suppose you 'd been caught ? " Luke was pacing up and down . His voice and gestures were so violent that the room seemed like a cage too small to hold him . " Balfour might have put you in the dungeon , or sent you to St. Augustine , or anything else his evil mind could dream of  --  did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , I thought of it ! " roared Luke . " I have n't had a night 's sleep since  --  " Celia felt a wicked amusement . " Luke ! " she cautioned . " Keep your voice down ! " Luke tried to . " I 'm sick with worrying ! " he said . " If you were n't thinking about yourself could n't you have had some consideration for me ? Away out in the swamp , not knowing  --  " Celia began to laugh . She could not help it , and she could not stop laughing until Luke grabbed her shoulder and gave her a shake . " What 's the matter now ? " he demanded . Her lips still quivering with merriment , Celia managed to answer . " Now you know what other people have borne because of you . " " What ? " said Luke . He spoke blankly . Celia thought with sudden understanding , We 're like each other . He has n't thought of that , any more than I thought of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a soldier . Soldiers always  --  " He broke off again . " Oh , stop talking about inc . I want to talk about you . Celia , did n't you know  --  " " No I did n't know ! " she retorted . " It never occurred to **25;1183;TOOLONG himself saying to no one in particular . " Tony may bring him home in front after all . " The horses swept past again . There was one tremulous instant when the whole confused scene was contained in the field of John 's vision  --  the huge staring eyes of the horses , the strain of their muscles , Tony Blackford clenching his teeth , Charlie Rhett on Red Rover with his high cheekbones shining with sweat , Andrew 's black wrinkled face working violently as he lashed Blue Fly , Magnus on Happy Girl moving his lips in the prayer he was known to repeat over and over during a race , little Jack Wendover leaning so far forward that Arion 's mane seemed to be blowing across his eyes  --  and then it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabella Stanhope 's wild Indian yell cut across the noises of the crowd . " Blue Fly ! Blue Fly ! Blue Fly ! " But John Bottomley knew it was n't going to be easy . The race was still wide open and any horse could win . The big surprise was Jack Wendover and Arion . If Tony Blackford was giving Skyrocket the ride of his life , Jack Wendover and Arion were also showing the crowd a thing or two . Blue Fly moved up to second , passing Red Rover and Happy Girl , and Arion , who on past performance should have run himself into the ground by now , found a new burst of speed . Bringing his horse up on the outside and then cutting in toward the rail in a way that could have meant his neck , Jack Wendover closed in on the leaders . Red Rover and Happy Girl fell behind , and a groan rose from their backers . Arion , Blue Fly , and Skyrocket ran neck and neck as they came into the final lap . John Bottomley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chadwick was standing remote and silent amid the tumult , that CordeliaLake was giving the whole show away by calling out Tony Blackford 's name instead of Skyrocket 's , that Arabella Stanhope was screeching her head off , and that first one horse and then the other was forging into the lead . Arion pulled out inches ahead , Skyrocket took the lead from Arion , Blue Fly fell back to third , and it looked as though Skyrocket had the cup  --  but no , not yet !  |p101The  three horses crossed the finish line in practically a dead heat , but it was Blue Fly who had won  --  a last roar went up , and there was that drained moment that comes after a race , the queer giddy emptiness , and then Arabella Stanhope was tearing after Blue Fly in the still unsettled dust , and everybody stood talking and milling about until Mr. Robertson , climbing on a chair , announced the decision of the judges  --  Blue Fly first , Arlon and Skyrocket tied for second , Happy Girl third , and Red Rover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Miss Chadwick as Senator Stanhopeand Arabella made their way through the crowd , the Senator leading Blue Fly , and Andrew still in the saddle . " Mr. Robertson will make a little speech and hand the Senator the cup . Later on it will be engraved and the Senator can keep it until the race next year . " John was lucky enough to find a place for Miss Chadwick and himselfdirectly in front of the table where the presentation was to be made . The crowd gathered round . Senator Stanhope held Blue Fly by her bridle , Arabella looked rather dusty and bedraggled after her turn on the track , having somewhere lost her crown of leaves , and Andrew 's big toothy grin crisscrossed his old wrinkles with various new ones stretching from car to ear . Mr. Robertson made his speech , getting in his customary allusions to gallantry , chivalry , and his own long tenure as president of the Agricultural Society , and turned to Senator Stanhope with the cup . Instead of accepting it , the Senator prompted Arabella to step forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received the trophy from Mr. Robertson . She tried to curtsy , went off balance with the weight of the cup , and along with the applause there was an undertoneof friendly , indulgent laughter . Senator Stanhope reached for the cup and put it back on the table . A Negro stableboy led Blue Fly away , and the crowd began to disperse . Senator Stanhope saw Miss Chadwick . He came forward with a happy , excited look on his face , saying , " Ah , Miss Chadwick ! How good to see you ! " and his eyes were swimming again . " Congratulations , Senator , " John said . " Your horse ran quite a race . "  | " Did n't she though ! " Senator Stanhope exclaimed . " I was sure for a moment that the cup belonged to Skyrocket , but the old girl never lost heart ! Not for a moment ! Did you ever see anything like that finish ! And you , Miss Chadwick ? Did you enjoy the race ? " " Oh yes , Senator Stanhope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Offer them ? You may even drink them , Miss Chadwick . Dr. Carpenterhas invited us to gather round the punch bowl . I would be delighted if you would accompany me . And you too , John . " " Thank you , Senator . But right now I want to look up Tony Blackfordand Jack Wendover . They ran us the best race in years and I 'd like to tell them so . I 'll see you both at the house . " He did n't mind Miss Chadwick 's leaving with the Senator . The Senator was fifty-eight , and he was twenty-five , and he could afford to be generous . Arabella , he noticed , had lagged behind . " Where 's Missy ? " she asked . " She 's around somewhere . I saw her just a few minutes ago . She was with some of the other girls . They may have gone to play croquet . " There was a smudge of dust on Arabella 's nose , and the excitement of the race seemed to have left her spent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? " " I 'm all right . " " You do n't look all right . Do you want to go up to the house and lie down ? I 'll find Missy and she 'll sit with you . " Arabella 's eyes flared . " You do n't have to put yourself out for me , John Bottomley ! " " Now see here , Arabella --  " " I 'm sorry , Johnny . I did n't mean to speak like that . Please forgive me . " " What in the world are you so cross about ? Blue Fly won , did n't she ? " " Yes , Blue Fly won . " " Are n't you glad ? " " Yes , I 'm glad . " " You do n't look very glad . "  | " Oh , who cares how I look ! Who cares about me or Blue Fly or anything ! " and before John could answer she started running toward the stables . " Arabclla ! Wait ! " If she heard , she did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided not to  --  it was n't his responsibility to cope with Arabella Stanhope in one of her moods . He looked for Jack Wendover and Tony Blackford , and then , not finding them anywhere around the track , he went up to the house . The curtains and decorations had been removed from the porch , where a punch bowl and glasses had been set out , and Senator Stanhope was still receiving congratulations . John was able to have a moment with Miss Chadwick alone . " I hope I will be able to see you again , Miss Chadwick . " " It is kind of you to say so , Mr. Bottomley . " " Will you be in town throughout the summer ? " " Yes , I have no other plans . " There were many times when John wished he had had wit enough to let it end there  --  if only , when Senator Stanhope reclaimed her , he had let her walk out of his life forever . He did not like to remember the two evenings he called on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away from the heat , and it was n't hard to manage , but what a fool he had been ! For if he had known that Senator Stanhope was looking in her direction , trusting to money and position to compensate for an oversupply of years , certainly she knew it too . He should have understood that she scorned being a schoolteacher , dressing and acting the part only because of some stubborn , perverse pride , and that the liveliness of imagination that had so pleased him was in no small part the alertness of ambition . He should have sensed that those cool blue eyes of hers were already taking stock , adding this , subtracting that , and that his own prospects , measuredagainst Senator Stanhope 's huge fortune , must have seemed paltry . But even if he had known  --  known beyond question  --  he was sure he would have refused to credit it . How could he have , when alreadyp104he was in love with her ? He knew now , did n't he ? What good did it do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All those days and nights at Deerskin . The knowing now what he did not know then , and the bitter , hateful realization that it made no difference . Fool ! Fool ! he said under his breath , watching the swirl of the polka on the floor , and then , as the music stopped and a cloud of applause rose to the ceiling , it was time to look up Arabella Stanhope for that waltz Missy had got him into.  |p105John  Bottomley found Arabclla in a bank of uniforms . Her white gown blossomed among the fire-gilt buttons and scarlet sashes . She wore a narrow black velvet ribbon around her throat , hung with a single jewel , and her thick hair , caught in a knot at the base of her neck , had taken on a bright and coppery sheen in the glow of the chandeliers . She stood laughing and chatting with the uniforms , first one and then another , occasionally sweeping them all with a single glance . All over town the next morning it would be said that Arabclla Stanhopehad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she purchased it  --  just as she was the first beauty of her generation , so was she its most unprincipled flirt . " Ah , John ! " she cried , catching sight of him . " I thought I 'd been deserted . Have you come to rescue me ? " The uniforms returned his bow . They were worn by Julian and Randolph Fitzpatrick , Charles Rhett , Jack Wendover , and Neville Monckton . With the exception of Neville Monckton , they were all old friends . It was Cameron 's disappearance , more than what might be regarded as his own lukewarmness to the cause , that was responsiblefor their reserved behavior . He could count on their tolerance until the first shot was fired . Arabella 's laugh came less readily , conversationlanguished , and one by one the uniforms took their leave . Neville Monckton was the last to go . " I shall claim you later , Miss Arabclla , " he said . " Mine is the third waltz from now , I believe . " It was hard for John to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Up to this evening he had been seen only on the fringes of society . Had it not been for his oldest brother , Ules , who out of his own pocket had put up fifteen thousand dollars to transform the Light Infantry from a social organization to a military unit , Neville would never have been admitted into its ranks . SomewhereJohn had read that war was the first engine of revolution , and in Neville Monckton 's presence at the Light Infantry Ball the first stirrings of revolution might be seen . " I shall be looking forward to our waltz , Mr. Monckton , " Arabella said , and the slow way she looked at Neville and the equally slow way he looked back caused John to think maliciously that it was a contest of beauties  --  much as lie disliked Neville , it was impossible to deny that the youngest of the Monckton brothers had been favored with extraordinary good looks . Nearly six feet tall , he had wavy brown hair , a fine profile , a small golden mustache , and a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , willing to forgive almost any vice in a man provided be be manly , Neville Monckton ran the risk of seeming effeminate . It was only the glint in his pale blue eyes that saved him , saying what his more intimate companions already knew  --  that he would not shrink from a fight , that he knew how to shoot , that he could handle a horse , and that he fancied himself , not without cause , as a devil of a fellow with women . Neville bowed and withdrew . The fiddles began tuning up . Arabella turned and smiled . " I 'm pleased to see you , John . " " And I you , Arabella . May I say that you 're looking extremely well this evening ? " " Why , John ! You 've paid me a compliment ! " " You 've been visiting Christina , I hear . " Arabella looked at him with pretended surprise . " But what an astonishmentthat you should have paid any attention to my whereabouts ! I should have imagined that I might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " John began to feel the stirrings of the annoyance Arabella always roused in him . He had n't seen her in nearly a year , and though shep107looked older and taller than he remembered , she had n't changed . She still thought it necessary to run through the finger exercises that she seemed to have memorized from some handbook of flirtation . " How is Christina ? " Arabella shook her head in a despairing , artificial way . " Bored , I fear . It 's dull as ditchwater on a plantation . But you do n't find it so , do you ? " " Sometimes . " " Why do you bury yourself on Deerskin , then ? Why do n't you marry ? I 'm told that there are any number of young ladies who would be pleased to brighten up your life for you , " and then , seeing how discomfited he was , she swallowed a smile . " Do n't look so glum , John . Ilave I not a right to interest myself in your welfare ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered . Having never been able to understand Arabella , he did not understand her now . " And what do you hear from Julie ? " " Only that she could n't get to the ball . How do my poor sisters stand it ? They spend all their time with the drudgery of a plantation , looking after a hundred different things , and what thanks do they get ? It 's the men who have the fun . Me , I 'd just as soon be in the dreadful place as to live in those tiresome swamps ! " According to Missy Bottomley , who kept John acquainted with the comings and goings of Pompey 's Head , it was Lydia who was responsiblefor Arabella 's prolonged absences from home . The ladies of the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society went further . They said Lydia and Arabella were finding it increasingly difficult to get along  --  but then , in all fairness , it had to be remembered that it was not easy for the ladies of the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society to speak kindly of Lydia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her marrying Senator Stanhope , and the second her exemplary behavior . By all rights the Senator should by now have been made to regret his impulsive wooing of a schoolteacher nobody , and , had justice prevailed , the arrows of regret should have been loosed from her bow . Senator Stanhope , however , presented the appearance of ap108completely happy man  --  much as the ladies of the Wednesday AfternoonLadies Society felt cheated by not having it proved that there was no fool like an old fool , the gentlemen of the Light Infantry Club envied him his good fortune . John led Arabella to the floor . The waltz was " Bohemian Girl , " and as they started dancing Arabella began humming under her breath . Humming while dancing was considered an error in deportment , against which the young ladies of Huntington Hall were specifically warned . Arabella kept on humming , however , dancing happily , and when Missy and Gordon Carpenter waltzed past , Missy looking gravely earnest and Gordon 's homely face transfigured as by some soft , inner light , John thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Missy 's saying petunia . Arabella caught sight of Missy and stopped humming . " How entrancing she is ! " she said . " I 've always envied her her looks . Those black , black eyes and light hair  --  could anything be more striking ? Tell me . Is she going to marry Gordy Carpenter ? " " I do n't know , Arabella . Do you ? " It was what all the girls in Missy 's and Arabella 's set were thinking , who was going to marry whom , and it was hard for John to get used to the fact that they were both of marriageable age . Actually , since they would soon be nineteen , it would n't be too long before it would be wondered if they were going to wither on the vine . A number of the girls in their group already had husbands , and , among those who had n't , a number of pairings , besides Missy and Gordon Carpenter , had been struck off  --  Cordelia Lake and Tony Blackford , Mary ElizabethManning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Arabella it was otherwise . No sooner was her name linked with that of some admirer than the link parted . For a time it would be Clay Vincent , then Tony Blackford 's slightly older brother Robert , then one of the Fitzpatrick twins , and then somebody from Charleston , Savannah , Port Royal , Beaufort , Georgetown , Columbia , or wherever it was she had recently been visiting  --  it was reported that Miss Elizabeth Paxton said that what Arabella really wanted was a harem , but that , naturally , was much too shocking to be believed.  | " A penny , John . " " What ? " " Poor man ! " Arabella shook her head . " You 'd much rather be talkingrice and cotton with the other gentlemen , would n't you ? " " Of course not . " " Alas , you do n't sound very convincing . Promise me that you wo n't be cross with Missy for getting you into this waltz . " " Cross ? " " Oh , John , how solemn you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be living at Deerskin that 's responsible . " John remembered Missy using practically the same words . Perhaps it was true : most likely he had changed . But what did they expect , these frivolous young girls ? Of course he was solemn  --  he had things to be solemn about . Arabella 's thoughts seemed to have run along with his . " Do n't be annoyed with me , Johnny . It 's Cameron you 're worried about , is n't it ? " and for a few seconds he lost time to the music  --  the mention of his brother 's name , so purposefully avoided all evening , took him that much by surprise . " Yes , Arabella , " he said . " Naturally I 'm worried . You do n't know anything about this that I would n't know , do you ? " " How could I ? I just came from Christina 's day before yesterday . I was bewildered when I heard . Have you no idea where Cameron may have gone to or why ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? " " I do n't quite know . Try to find him , I guess . " " Dear John . So good you are . Promise you 'll always be my friend . " Over Arabella 's shoulder John saw Lydia dancing with Mr. WingfieldManning , the new president of the Agricultural Society . Old Mr. Robertson , at eighty-seven , had finally taken his hierarchical notions to the severest hierarchy of all . Lydia 's dancing with Mr. Manning seemed innocent enough , and yet John knew that she had let herself in for further criticism . It always amused him that the worst indictmentthe ladies of the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society couldp110find to bring against Lydia was that she was too ambitious . The severalcounts of the indictment stemmed from a common root  --  who had rekindled Senator Stanhope 's interest in politics ; who would have urged him to stand for the Senate again were there still a Senate to stand for ; who nourished his ambition to become a cabinet officer when a confederation of the Southern states was formed ? Nor were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that Lydia was thinking only of the Senator . They wrapped the whole of their animosity in a final question  --  she 's his wife , is n't she ? Seen in this light , Lydia 's dancing with Mr. Wingfield Manning took on more than a social meaning . Mr. Manning was a most influentialman . The Agricultural Society , like all the other agricultural societies in the South , was a potent political organization . And besides being its president , which in itself would have made him someone to reckon with , Mr. Manning was the most powerful member of the state legislature . It was a certainty that he would be one of those called upon to attend the constitutional convention of any new government that might be formed , and although he alone could not put Senator Stanhope in the cabinet , he could help him take a long step in that direction . John wondered if Missy was right about Lydia 's being responsible for Arabella 's frequent absences from home . It was n't that Lydia was mean to Arbell , Missy said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to her . That was n't it . It was hard to say just what it was exactly , since Arhell was too proud ever to admit that anything was wrong , but there were a lot of little things that anyone could see  --  things like the Senator 's never taking Arbell to the springs after he married Lydia , and his selling Blue Fly to Mr. Rhett when he found out that Lydia did n't like racing , and Lydia 's always giving parties for a lot of political people with whom Arbell felt out of place . What she thought it was , Missy said , was that Arbell had come to feel that she was n't necessary to her father any more  --  almost any girl would feel like that , especially if she had been as close to her father as Arhell used to be , and while Lydia could n't exactly be blamed , or the Senator either , it was his marrying Lydia that caused the change.  | " Will you be home for long , Arabella ? " " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Savannah , and Julie wants me to come back to Georgetown , and I promised Cordelia Lake that if she went to visit her cousins in Charleston --  " Just then Lydia and Mr. Wingfield Manning came by again . Mr. Manning 's face was aglow , and he was waltzing with a sort of portly abandon , and John thought that if it depended on Mr. Manning alone , Senator Stanhope was as good as in the cabinet . Lydia 's eyes met John 's and she pressed her lips together in what could be taken for a smile . He inclined his head in a slight nod , and as some slight change of expression crossed her face  --  amusement ? disinterest ? speculation ? what ?  --  he again found himself at odds with the music . He said , " I 'm sorry , Arabella . I do n't know what 's the matter with me this evening , " and then , as Lydia 's eyes traveled from him to Arabella in the same aloof , detached glance that he remembered from the greenhouse at Happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " Yes , Arabella . You were saying ? " " ! - lave you forgotten so soon ? " " Of course I have n't forgotten . You were saying that you might be going away again . Why do you ? We miss you . " " Do you now , Mr. Bottomley ? That 's most interesting to hear . " She gave a little malicious laugh . " You missed me all last summer , I suppose ? " " Well , Arabella , last summer was a busy time . A lot of my people were sick , and we had to help with the work at Cornwall , and besides that --  " " Cornwall my foot ! I never see you any more from one year to the next . Miss me ! Avoid me , or avoid somebody , would seem to be more like it . Miss me indeed ! What a clumsy piece of flattery ! " John felt that he had enough to put up with without one of Arabella'sfits of bad temper . " Look , Arabella , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry , " and then the waltz ended . Arabella made an elaborate , mocking curtsy  --  it was bound to be noticed , and all over town the next morning it too would be added to the talk . She said , " I so enjoyedp112our waltz , Mr. Bottomlcy . Thank you most kindly , sir . Do n't waste away with missing me , " and he was not sorry when the uniforms converged on her again . Neville Monckton was not among them . He was standing with Constance Pettibone , waiting for the next dance . Out of a corner of his eve John saw him look at Arabella in an open , almost insolent way , and more directly he saw her cast Neville a long , sideways glance . Much as John was annoyed with her , he wished she would n't encourageNeville Monckton . Let him get it into his head that an invitation was extended , and he would be restrained by none of those **25;1210;TOOLONG that she took for granted . Handing Arabella over to Jack Wendover , who was next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . He felt in need of a drink and a cigar . Walking toward the door of the ballroom , and having in mind a small room set aside for those who , like himself , might feel in need of a drink and a cigar , he saw Ules Monckton absorbed in conversation with Lydia Stanhope . Ules Monckton was wearing one of the new uniforms . There was a hint of the schoolmaster in his appearance , a longncss of skull and a balding bookishness that suggested the Reverend Mr. Daniel Pryse of Huntington Hall , and he wore his uniform poorly . His body had not vet molded the cloth to its shape , and even when it did he would be too gangly , too loose-jointed , and too stoop-shouldered ever to seem anything but a civilian stray . John remembered what Cameron had said about Ules 's ambition to assume command of the Light Infantry , and he had picked up enough information to know the matter was all but settled . Ules 's putting up the money needed to activate the Light Infantry had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had dug down into his own pocket while older men like Corwin Bottomley and Senator Stanhope were still debating the politics of secession . Though Corwin and his planter friends did not want for influence , they no longer had absolute political power . Theirs was the day when the South had ruled Washington almost as completely as it ruled Richmond , New Orleans , Charleston , and Mobile . With them ,  |p113as  with most Southern spokesmen of their generation , secession was more a threat than a program . They had not really wanted the South to leave the Union . They wanted the Union to accommodate the South on its own terms . Often as they threatened secession , it was doubtful they believed the threat would have to be carried out . And now that it had and a new nation was in the making , they were no longer able to control the forces they had helped unloose . New times meant new men , intolerant of compromise , determined to act , and Ules Monckton was one of the new men . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was apparent he enjoyed being in Lydia 's company . His face , however , had none of the bubbly pleasure that had diffused that of Mr. Wingfield Manning . It wore an expression of intense concentration , and Lydia 's countenance , as she listened to him , had taken on a matching intensity of its own . They gave the impression of forming a unit , of being somehow joined together , and it struck John Bottomley that the bond between them was not hard to discover . It was power that Lydia wanted , and so did Ules Monckton want power , and the hard ruthless drive of the one was matched by the quite different and yet no less forceful determinationof the other . And there was another bond between them , hardly less meaningful . Lydia Chadwick , who only a few years ago had been a little schoolteacher living on Gunpowder Street , was now Mrs. SenatorStanhope , and Ules Monckton , who used to be a struggling lawyer in a one-room office over a harness shop , was but a few days away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come a long way , following almost parallel lines , and it intrigued John to recall that he had been privileged to know them at the beginnings of their careers.  |p115The  first time John Bottomley had seen Ules Monckton was at a meeting of the Agricultural Society on the evening of Thursday , September7 , 1854 . John had come down the river on the Serena Moore especially to attend the meeting . He had just been elected to the Agricultural Society , and it was the first of its sessions he was privilegedto attend . The Agricultural Society met in a square , high-ceilinged room on the second floor of Mechanics Hall , a small brick building of early republican architecture that stood on the corner of Bullis and Hightowerstreets . A number of glass cases stood against the walls , full of stuffed birds , Indian relics , blue ribbons that members of the society had won at various fairs , and displays of rice , cotton , peas , corn , and other agricultural products . Old Mr. Robertson presided over the meeting , and about forty members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were plantation owners , and some , like his father and Senator Stanhope , had held political office . According to its charter , which hung framed on one of the walls , the Agricultural Society had been founded " to aid and assist in the development of soil and animal husbandry with special attention to the cultivation of rice and cotton . " Over the years , however , it had taken on an increasingly political coloration . The reading of two papers was on the program  --  " A Consideration of the Merits of Island Guano from Jarvis and Baker Islands in the South Pacific Ocean , " by Dr. James Carpenter , and " Our Southern Destiny , " by Mr. Ules Monckton.  |p116Dr  . Carpenter 's paper , was listened to attentively . Large deposits of guano had been discovered on Jarvis and Baker islands in the Pacific , and it was being advertised as being superior and as much as fifteen dollars a ton cheaper than the Peruvian guano that most planters used . It had interested Dr. Carpenter to conduct sonic experiments at Happy Chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritive as Peruvian guano , and here Dr. Carpenter gave some yields per acre of sweet potatoes , the Jarvis and Baker variety , because it appeared not to stimulate root growth to excess , would seem to hold less danger of killing off plants during a dry season , as Peruvian guano was known to do . Dr. Carpenter then read more figures and concluded by saying that the members of the society might find the Jarvis and Baker guano suitable for cane , peanuts , and sweet potatoes , and less suitable for corn and cotton  --  always remembering , he would like to repeat , that there would probably be less yield per acre . The appreciative applause that followed Dr. Carpenter 's remarks was followed by a hum of voices as the members discussed his paper , twisting and turning in their seats . After a reasonable time Mr. Robertsonrapped for order . Ile thanked Dr. Carpenter for a most constructiveand interesting contribution and introduced the next speaker  --  " Our fellow member , Mr. Ules Monckton , will address us on the subject of Our Southern Destiny . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monckton 's name had often entered the family conversationat Indigo , John Bottomley had never seen him before . Watching him walk to the lectern at one end of the room and then stand facing his audience , John felt rather disappointed . Without havinga sinister reputation , neither had Ules a conventional one , and John had not expected to be reminded of one of those tutors , so often of Yankee extraction , who had charge of the young people on the more isolated plantations . Ules 's gangly frame , his thin growth of sandy hair , his slightly bulbous forehead , his long nose , and his loose , large mouth , half concealed by a scraggly red mustache , all added up to what most people would call a common , ordinary , undistinguished sort of man . All John knew about the Moncktons was what he had heard , andp117most of what he had heard came from his father . Corwin Bottomleycalled them climbers . What he meant was that none of their people had ever been of the planter class . Of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oldest . He was forty-one . Gup was thirty-nine and Neville twenty . Two Monckton daughters had intervened between Gup and Neville , but they no longer lived in Pompey 's Head . One was married to a merchant in Camden , the other to a druggist somewhere in the upcountry . Having thus taken themselvesbeyond the pale , they were never heard of again . Details such as these , however , might be part of any number of personalhistories . What made the Moncktons remarkable was that their name was n't Monckton at all . It was Simpson . One of the favorite stories of Pompey 's Head was how the three Simpson brothers , seven years before , had marched under Ules 's leadership to the county courthouse and petitioned that their name be changed from their father'sto their maternal grandmother 's . Beyond the grandmother , in some forgotten pocket of time , there once lived a Frederick Monckton distantly connected with that Miles Monckton who , at the Battle of Little Pigeon Marsh , had ridden to a hero 's death and legendary fame . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas Simpson was too intimately associated with the debt-ridden , snuffdippinglawyer who was remembered in Pompey 's Head , when he was remembered at all , for his extraordinary bouts with the bottle . At the time of the march on the courthouse , John Bottomley was in his first year at Princeton . He heard about it in a letter from his father . " I need not tell you the entertainment it has provided , " Corwin wrote . " What these Simpson-Moncktons or Monckton-Simpsons hope to gain by such a move I can not imagine . It is like taking a gray mare and painting her brown and then trying to pass her off as a chestnut . As the saying goes , It wo n't wash . ' I returned home yesterday from a short trip to our properties on Little River , and if I heard the story of the Simpson-Moncktons Monckton-Simpsons once , I must have heard it twenty times . Could anything be more fantastical ? " Though Corwin had no way of knowing it at the time , the answer was yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose plantation , Oak Hill , was not far from Dr. Carpenter 's IIappy Chance . The widow Jackson , nee Minerva Pryor , belonged to one of the long-established plantation families . It came as a surprise that she and Ules Monckton were even acquainted . People like the Rhetts and the Mannings suddenly found themselves related to Ules by marriage . Calls had to be made and invitations extended . It was obligatory to admit Ules into the Agricultural Society , and though some of the members found it hard to swallow , there was no way of excluding him , because of the Rhetts and Mannings , from the Light Infantry Club . Tongues were bound to wag . Corwin Bottomley grumbled that Ules Monckton was worse than a Vermont Yankee in his desire to get ahead , and Mrs. Percy Wyeth Blackford II , who at seventy-nine was old enough to say what she pleased , told the Wednesday AfternoonLadies Society that Minerva Pryor was one of those women who would do anything to keep from getting into bed all by herself on a cold winter night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not held too much against him . Not too much . A good alliance was understoodto be one of the ways by which a man might better himself , and the widow Jackson had been notorious for her plainness . A numberof coarse remarks were passed across the card tables of the Light Infantry Club , and most opinion in that quarter came to agree that whatever that Monckton fellow had got , it was n't altogether a bargain  --  beinghitched to that kind of plow , it was observed , must be damned uphill work . In 1852 , three years after Ules 's marriage , Pompey 's Ilead was swept by one of the worst epidemics of yellow fever the low country had ever known . More than a hundred people died in and around the city , and among the unfortunates was the widow Jackson . The end of the epidemicleft Ules the sole proprietor of Oak Hill and four other plantations , a slave owner and man of property . That he did not try to press his advantage was held in his favor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came his way , and remained in mourning for exactly a ear . But then , in the autumn of 1853 , Ules served notice that his am/bition went beyond being a plantation owner with a sideline in law . He sold one of his lesser plantations and bought the News . As editor he installed his brother Gup , the head bookkeeper for the wholesale hardware company of Murdoch &; Brown . Gup , however , was more than a bookkeeper . He was also Publicus , a frequent contributor to the correspondence columns of the News , where his lively intelligence ranged over a host of such interrelated subjects as slavery , secession , and the supremacy of cotton as a weapon against the North  --  it was Publicus , so far as Pompey 's Head was concerned , who coined the maxim that cotton was king . He had ability and would serve Ules well . What , though , did Ules want ? On the evening of Thursday , September7 , 1854 , as he rose to address the Agricultural Society , the question was not yet answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . Dr. Carpenter had read his paper , but Ules Monckton , John saw , was going to speak from memory . John noticed that his father , who was sitting to his right , had stiffened in his chair , half scowling , hunchingforward a little , and that Mr. Blackford , who sat to his left , had half turned his head so that his right ear , the good one , was held in the direction of the speaker . New though John was to the Agricultural Society , he understood what was happening  --  this was the first time Ules Monckton had been invited to address the members , and he was still very much on trial . " You know what I think ? " Corwin Bottomley said one night in John 's presence at the Light Infantry Club , shortly after Ules had bought the News . " What I think is that that fellow would like to sweep us all from the board . You take a fellow like that , coming up out of nowhere , and he 's obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to be King ! You think it 's fantastical , eh ? Well , all I can say is that I 'm glad there ai n't a throne and that I ai n't the one who stands in his way . I do n't like the look in his eye . I 've seen the look of a deadp120sheepshead that I 've liked better . I would n't trust him from here to that spittoon ! " How far the other members of the Agricultural Society would be willing to trust Ules Monckton , John had no way of knowing . But a long way from completely , he imagined . Ules had no close friends . He kept to himself and invited no confidences . The gregarious gentlemenof the Agricultural Society were not used to that kind of self-sufficiency . The looks on their faces made it easy to see that they were more interested in him and what he might be up to than they were in the merits of guano from Jarvis and Baker islands in the Pacific Ocean . Ules Monckton started in the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Society , " and went on to observe that the South stood at the dawn of a new era in the history of civilization . It must be plain to his listeners that the federal Union could not maintainitself much longer . He would pass over the state of thralldom in which the South found itself . The ambition of the North to crush every Southern aspiration was too well known for him to dwell upon . But that the South would meekly continue in its present condition , slandered , vilified , ground down by the tariff , the very keystone of its social and economic structure under endless attack  --  surely it was time , long past time , for the South to serve notice that the end of its patiencehad come ! A number of voices said , " Hear , Hear , " some in an undertone , othersmore audibly , and John Bottomley , reflecting with one part of his mind that this was the first openly defiant secession speech he had ever heard , marveled with another at the change that had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a plantation tutor now . He spoke in a ringing , splendid voice , and the loose hang of his gangly , stoop-shouldered frame was braced with confidence and authority . It was his eyes , however , that most caught John 's attention . They were of a curious slate-colored shade , and before he started to speak , as he stood behind the lectern , they had seemed to be filmed with a dull , flat inertia that gave more an impression of secrecy than of sight . But now the flatness was gone . The slate-colored inertia hadp123given way to a feverish brightness . It seemed to reflect banked , hiddenfires . It might even be thought a little mad . " How often do they cry out the sacredness of the Union , our enemiesin the North ! But is not the true burden of their cry the sacrednessof their right to pillage and plunder the South ? Let us hesitate no longer ! Let us put forth the proposition that if the time has come for either the South or the Union to pass from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , that must endure ! The Union belongs to the past . The South is in league with the future ! " It was treason Ules Monckton was speaking , John realized , and yet he knew it expressed no more than the extreme Southern point of view . It was what followed that left him stunned . Ules said the Union was a jerry-built thing . He said that it had been founded on a philosophicalerror and that Thomas Jefferson and most of the other leading statesmen of his time were wrong  --  worse than wrong : incapable of understanding one of nature 's profoundest laws : betrayed by sentimentalityinto the worst kind of error . John found it hard to believe that any man could be so audacious . He noticed that his father was looking unfriendlier than ever , that Mr. Blackford had leaned forward and cupped his ear , as was his habit when he believed he had not heard correctly , and that Senator Stanhope , who had been fingering an unlighted cigar , was sittingbolt upright and pressing the cigar all out of shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were used to hearing diatribes against the North . Pompey 's Head had come to dependupon such outbursts for some of its best entertainment . But this was more than a diatribe , an entirely different departure . Their faces were full of distrust . " Why am I emboldened to say that Jefferson and most of the other statesmen of his time were wrong ? " Ules Monckton asked . " Because they were wrong ! Let not reverence blind us to the fact . And why were they wrong ? Because they ignored the proper status of the Negro . Jefferson 's ideas of government rested upon the assumption of the equality of races . This was an error , a misreading of all of nature 's laws.  | " The Negro by nature , or by the curse against Canaan , is fitted for that condition which he occupies in our society . It is , indeed , in conformitywith the laws of the Creator , and the great objects of humanityare best attained in conformance to his decrees . Let us be guided by these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and soon the other nations of the world , recognizing the wisdom of our course , will follow where we lead . The stone of slavery , rejected by the builders of the Union , must become the cornerstone of our new edifice . Let us delay no longer ! Let the work begin ! " A cheer came from the rear of the room , followed by another , and then Ules Monckton was receiving an ovation . Even Corwin Bottomleyand the other members of the old guard were moved to join in . This was n't as bad as they had anticipated . If what this Monckton fellow meant was that Thomas Jefferson had been wrong because he did n't see that the niggers had to be kept in their place , why of course Jefferson had been wrong ! That had been their way of thinking all along . It just had n't occurred to them that , with a little tinkering here and there , their sentiments could be built into a philosophy . Maybe this fellow had some good stuff in him after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beginning to suspect that Ules was no ordinary man and that most of the things he had heard about him were wrong . For one thing , it was a mistake to call him a climber . He could hardly be more indifferent to the success he was having . Popularity was unimportant to him . Perhaps nothing was important to him except his vision of the future . But what most interested John was that the moment Ules stopped speaking his eyes became flat and dull again , heavy-lidded , as though only the articulation of his thought had power enough to make them come alive . Ules sipped from a glass of water and waited for quiet . He put down the glass , and his eyes remained fixed in their hooded , secret look , and then he began speaking again . The South , he said , had an empire to claim . It lay in the direction of the equator , beyond the Gulf of Mexico . Did the gentlemen of the Agricultural Society recall the heroic exploits of William Walker ? He was confident they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported in the News . He would like , however , to go further into the matter . Most of all he wished to impress upon his listeners that Mr. Walker was no mere adventurer . That was simply another piece of slander on the part of the Northern press . There was reason for the slander . It so happened that Mr. Walker was one of the most devotedpartisans of the South . The name of William Walker was unfamiliar to John Bottomley at first , but then he . remembered having read about him in the News  --  a Tennessee man who had been a doctor , lawyer , editor , and more recently the leader of a filibustering expedition to Mexico . " A plain damn fool ! " Corwin Bottomley had said at breakfast at Indigo one morning , glowering over the News . " He could n't make a living no place else , so now he wants to make himself president of Mexico . And here 's Gup Monckton calling him a great man . Great man , my behind ! A damn-fool crackpot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ules Monckton said  --  a man of bold , inspiring imagination . I.ct the gentlemen of the Agricultural Society pause to consider what N Ir . Walker 's attempt to establish himself in Mexico meant in relation to the South . And let it be remembered that had it not been for the machinations of the federal government , which had stepped in to preventsupplies and reinforcements from reaching Mr. Walker , he would have succeeded in his aim . Mr. Walker 's cause , it would be recalled , had at first been attended with success . Having invaded Mexico , he had proclaimed Lower California and the neighboring state of Sonora an independent republic , with himself at its head . And such might be the present state of affairs had it not been for the interference of the federal government . And what was the reason for such interference ? Why had the federal government put every obstacle in Mr. Walker 's war ! ? " What is not generally known about Mr. Walker , " Ules Monckton said , " is that he is a slavery man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to maintain his position in Mexico , would have been to abolish the laws forbidding slavery . " Think of what that would have meant to our cause ! " And think , also , had the South been free to act , as the independentp124nation it should be , how we could have assisted Mr. Walker . With men , with arms , with money . And consider the results that might have been accomplished ! Mr. Walker , having secured his base of operations in Sonora , would then have been able , through our aid , to march on to the conquest of all Mexico ! " For years we have expended our efforts in a vain political struggle to bring one new slave state into the Union . But what if , instead of a slave state , we had a slave country as an ally  --  nay , more than an ally : a dependency ! " What good to us are those stretches of barren desert in the West ? Shall we think forever only in terms of how many congressional votes we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our destiny lies to the South ! Mexico awaits but the landing of a Southern army to become the first of our foreign possessions ! We have an empire to claim ! " John Bottomley sat spellbound . He had heard of visionaries and read of men who believed they could bend the shape of history to their will , but never had he'imagined that he would someday be sharingthe same room with one and hearing a vision told out loud . For Mexico was but the beginning . After Mexico would come Nicaragua , then Honduras , and after Honduras Guatemala , followed by El Salvadorand Costa Rica , and then across the Caribbean to Cuba and Santo Domingo  --  a golden circle of slave countries which would be under Southern control : truly an empire : a dazzlement of power and riches that would make the Confederacy one of the mightiest nations in the world . But the vision was too intense . Absorbed in politics though they were , the gentlemen of the Agricultural Society were essentially planters . The world they envisioned , should it become necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world not too unlike their own plantations  --  domesticated , patriarchal , and orderly . And the Southern heartland , stretching from the Potomac to the Gulf of Mexicoand from the Rio Grande to the Atlantic , was empire enough . Ules Monckton said , " Think of the prospect , gentlemen . Let your imaginations extend a hundred years into the future , " but the imag/inations of the gentlemen of the Agricultural Society were not that expansive . Ules lost his audience . His success went down to failure . I Ie ended as he began , a man too intense for comfort , an outsider , a probationer who , having had his chance , had missed his opportunity . John knew that Ules was too shrewd not to sense what was happening . He persisted to the end , however , his voice ringing out as though lie believed he was still in control , and when finally he finished , standing slack and stoop-shouldered , his dull eyes staring into failure , something in the stiff , mechanical way he bowed to the grudging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less for the gentlemen of the Agricultural Society than they cared for him . The South could not depend on them and their kind much longer . Ile was willing to bide his time . That was seven years ago , and on this evening of the Light Infantry Ball , as he stood conversing with Lydia Stanhope , Ules Monckton could say his time had come . John doubted , however , that he thought in those terms . That was what made him so puzzling , and why the gentlemen of the Light Infantry Club were still asking what did he want . Part of the answer was known  --  he wanted power ; but the larger part of the answer  --  power for what ?  --  was as much a mystery as ever . John had heard a number of speculations put forward  --  Ules Moncktonwanted to be governor ; he hoped to become a general ; he wished to be made minister to one of the foreign powers  --  but John felt that what he wanted was both larger and lesser than any of these . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concreteness : they were unable to understand ambition that did not turn on personal gain . John did not think that what Ules Monckton wanted was so mysterious . All one had to do was to read the editorials in the News . If Ules confided in no man , he did not mind confessing to the world . And what he wanted was no more than he wanted the night he addressed the Agricultural Society . He wanted to see his vision come true.  |p127When  John Bottomley entered the room that had been set aside for those who might want to relax for a few moments over a drink or a cigar , he found it warm , crowded , and full of smoke . Some of the gentlemenwere refreshing themselves from a silver punch bowl , others had flung themselves into armchairs , and still others were grouped about this or that topic of conversation , striving to make themselves heard . " Once that baboon from Illinois is in the White House , we 'll have no choice . If he tries to reinforce the forts --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other states join in and Virginia will join too . My wife had a letter from a cousin in Lynchburg , and he says --  " " Biggest damn buck you ever saw ! He came busting out of the swamps like he was carrying a rocking chair on his head , his spread was that large . You remember the buck that Ransom Truett got two years ago ? Well , this one --  " " Look at it this way . If I have to pay the bank twelve per cent , and if my factors will carry me for eleven --  " " What will the North do without our cotton ? " " What will England do ? " " And France ? Do n't forget France . " " It was in the third race at the Twin Oaks track . If that damn nigger jockey had n't lost a stirrup --  " " Yes , and if a bullfrog had wings --  " " What I say is that there ought to be an oath ! And any man whop128wo n't sign it , swearing he 's ready to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God he ought to be tarred and feathered and run out of town ! " It was Clay Vincent speaking , and as he unburdened himself he happened to notice John Bottomley . Clay was in uniform , dark and handsome , as all the Vincents were , and though there was no reason for John to believe Clay had had him in mind , he began to feel uncomfortable . Clay 's stern expression neither hardened nor relaxed . " Good evening , John . " " How are you , Clay ? " Clay had been directing his remarks to Jeremiah Lake and Robert Blackford , and John hesitated before he joined them  --  had it not been that he did not want openly to acknowledge the separateness he felt , he would not have . Neither Jeremiah nor Robert was in uniform , but John knew that their evening clothes , unlike his own , would not be held against them . Jeremiah had resigned his commission in the Navy , and Robert , who only a few days ago had returned from London , where he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to have a uniform made . " You have a good time in London , Rob ? " John asked . " Not unless you can call freezing to death a good time . Our English cousins ought to be introduced to the advantages of lightwood and pitch pine . If there 's anything I hate , it 's a cold climate . " " And you , Jeremiah ? I 'd ask after your new bride , except that there 's no reason to . If I have your permission to say so , she looks radiant this evening . You must have left quite a wake of despair in Mobile , carryingoff such a prize . " Jeremiah fingered the small blond mustache he had lately grown . " If I say yes I stand convicted of arrogance , and if I say no I seem unappreciative of my good fortune . You make it hard for me , John . But I 'll tell Molly what you said . She 'll be pleased . " This , though , was forced conversation . What they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John knew his presence interfered . Clay Vincent could be seen getting increasingly restive . Things had fallen silent for a moment , and it was part of Clay 's vitalityp129not to be happy with silence . He understood the proprieties and wanted to respect them , but he looked like a man struggling in quicksand . Finally the struggle was too much : another moment and he would have gone under . He turned to John and said : " Now that we may be at war with the North most any minute , do . you still think we ca n't win ? " It was Clay 's right to ask : he and John had grown up together . What sounded like a question , however , was actually a challenge . John saw that Jeremiah 's and Robert 's face had taken on the same expression , a look that hovered midway between solicitude and alarm , and two thoughts ran side by side in his mind  --  that Jeremiah and Robert were afraid things might get out of hand and that there were pleasanter things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to he one of your best friends . He said , as much to Jeremiah and Robert is to Clay : " I 'm not aware , Clay , that we have ever discussed this particular matter before . You pretend to ask what I think , when actually you 're assuming you know . Why not make sure of your ground before jumpingto conclusions ? " Clay looked less confident . " All right then ! " he said . " Maybe we have n't talked about it , not in so many words . But did n't I hear you say --  " Look , you fellows , " Robert Blackford interposed . " Why do n't we have a drink ? That 's a specially noble batch of punch that 's been brewed up for tonight , and I 'm ready for another glass . " But Clay Vincent was not going to be diverted . Looking straight into John 's eyes , and with his heavy black brows bunched over his own , he said , " Exactly what do you think ? How am I wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the club , five or six months hack , that you could n't agree that the South was bound to win over the North . Ai n't that what you said ? " Clay Vincent had never been one to keep his voice down . His demanding " Ai n't that what you said ? " cut across the room . The various conversations crumbled about their edges and fell into an apprehensivesilence . This was how trouble started these days . One word ledp130to another , tempers flared , and there was no way of telling how things would end . Aware that he and Clay had become the center of attention , and with some still disengaged part of his mind identifying the music that drifted from the ballroom as another waltz , " Evening Star , " John said : " You 're right , Clay . I did say that I do n't think the South is bound to win . I do n't agree that once we go to war the North will fold up in a month or two . Instead of being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long one , and I believe we must consider the possibility that the South may lose . Once we get into a war --  " Clay Vincent gave an irritated snort . " Hell , how can we lose ! How could the North last out a war ? What will the North do without our cotton , just for one thing ? " and the tension in the room began to ease . The punch bowl was remembered , conversation was resumed , and John was able to feel that while he may not have won any general approval , neither had he aroused any particular hostility . Clay Vincent said , " With our cotton , we hold the trump hand ! Once we start holding back our cotton , the North will start caving in , " and he began repeating a set of arguments that John remembered from an editorial in the News  --  without Southern cotton , the trade and commerce of the North would come to a standstill ; its ships would rot at the wharves ; its looms would stand idle ; its other factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roam the streets , crying for bread . " The North could n't last out a month ! " Clay Vincent insisted . " That ai n't the point , though . What we have to do is to give the North a licking ! That 's what it 's been asking for , and that , by God , is what it ought to get ! Ai n't I right , Rob ? Do n't you agree , Jeremiah ? " Jeremiah Lake looked grave for a moment , and John awaited his reply . It had n't been easy for Jeremiah to leave the Navy  --  as he had said the day of the picnic at Happy Chance , secession had made it a hard choice for the Lakes . It had been less than a month since he handed in his resignation , and the strain he had been under still lined his face . He said : " All that I 'm inclined to agree about right now is that I 'd like anotherdrink . My wife has been generous enough to save me a dancep131and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , Clay , I feel that I 'm obliged to say  --  if , that is , you promise not to start spouting like a wounded whale again . " " All right . I promise . What is it ? " " Just this . What John here was saying makes more sense than you seem to imagine . It could be a long war , a very long war , and we 'd be foolish to be overconfident --  No , you promised not to start spouting . I do n't want to get into an argument . Let 's have that drink , shall we ? " " Wait just a minute ! " Clay said . " There 's one question I 'd like to ask . Seeing as how you 're a Navy man , then how do you figure --  " Robert Blackford took Clay by the arm . There was a strain of shortnessin the Blackford line , and Robert , like his younger brother Tony , was an inch or so below the average height . His head came just above Clay 's shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command . He said , " I want a drink , Clay Vincent . I 've been wanting a drink for the past five minutes . Besides , I 'm tired of hearing you carry on . A stranger coming in , he would figure you 're the only Southern man in this room . And you ai n't . Remember that . You ai n't ! Now , dammit , let 's have that drink ! " And that was where the evening should have ended , John often thought later  --  Clay Vincent 's animosity had been turned , Robert Blackford and Jeremiah Lake had gone out of their way to show they were his friends , and for the first time , as they stood around the punch bowl , he enjoyed being at the ball . It was just his bad luck that Ules Monckton picked that moment to appear . He was listening to Robert tell about the streets of London , and Jeremiah the Italian ports , when Clay Vincent , turning away from the punch bowl , said in a voice full of admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you join us ? You know my friends , do n't you ? " Ules Monckton said it was his good fortune to have that pleasure , and John could feel his good spirits begin to drain away . He understood that he need expect no consideration from Ules Monckton . Ules would be remembering that he had not attended any of the recent meetings of the Light Infantry , that he had shown a huge in/difference to Hardee 's Tactics , and that , if gossip was to be believed , he was the only man present whose loyalties might be questioned . " We 've been discussing how long the war is going to last , " Clay Vincent said to Ules . " I agree with you , sir , that it will all be over with one fight , but Jeremiah and John here , they feel that the war could turn into a long one . Tell them what you said at our last meeting , sir . " But that too had been in the News  --  read the News , John thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on in Ules Monckton 's mind . John was more interested in him than in his opinionthat the war could be decided by a single battle . Ules had aged considerably since the night he addressed the Agricultural Society . Forty-one then , he was forty-eight now . He looked much older , however . His thin growth of sandy hair had receded beyond the middle of his scalp , a tier of oxbow wrinkles creased his forehead , and there were several gray patches in his ragged red mustache . He was thinner , too , but he looked not so much thin as wasted . John was reminded of a remark credited to old Mr. Robertson just before he died . Mr. Robertsonwas spending the evening at the Light Infantry Club , playing whist , and the talk got around to Ules Monckton . It was shortly after Ules bought the News . " The trouble with that fellow , " Mr. Robertson said , " is that he 's too much like that other fellow in Shakespeare , the one that thinks too much . Thinking 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it starts clogging up the stomach , and there ai n't nothing like stomach trouble for eating a man away . I do n't hold with that kind of thinking myself . What good does it do ? " Were Ules Monckton less formidable , one might feel sorry for him . No matter how significantly he triumphed , he would never belong . Old Mr. Robertson was dead , but there would always be other Mr. Robertsons . Nothing had changed since the night of the Agricultural Society meeting . He was still too intense for comfort . Watching him , John was reminded of someone he knew or used to know . He could n't place who it was at first , and then , when Ules Monckton , rousing himself , said , " I think it most improbable that the war will be a long one . Let us consider for a moment what might be called the philosophicaldifferences between the two sections , " it came as a surprise top133discover that it was Professor Adam Sedgewick . The two could not be more unlike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an affinity . They were joined by what Mr. Robertson had held to be a fault . It could be said of them that they both thought too much , and what good did that kind of thinking do ? Ules Monckton said that the difference between North and South might be seen in part as the difference between Puritan and Cavalier . And though the analogy could easily be carried beyond the point of usefulness , it helped explain some of the things that separated the two sections . " The North , " he observed , " has a civilian outlook . We , on the other hand , are a military people . We always have been . Why , in this county alone there could be raised a force of cavalry that would do credit to the finest army in Europe . Our boys ride like Arabs . And as for marksmen , give me a company of low-country deer shooters and I 'll promise to hold any regiment of the Regular Army at bay . " " And so it is your opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You believe that because of our skill with horses and arms , a Southern army , meeting the Northern forces for the first time , would be bound to carry the day . Is that it ? " " Yes sir , it is , " Ules Monckton replied . " But we hold an even greater advantage . Our courage . A Southern man is bred to courage . He would consider himself disgraced if he turned away from a fight . A man in the North takes a different view . He is less bold , less individualistic . Used to living in crowds , he has become a crowd creature . It has made him timid and cautious . An army can not be created from the urban masses , especially when , as has happened in the North , they have been swollen by hordes of immigrants  --  an armed mob , yes , but not an army . " " You see what I told you ! " Clay Vincent said . " One good fight and the North will be done for ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that right , sir ? " " Such is my belief , " Ules answered . " But only if our leadership does not hesitate or falter . We must drive on relentlessly  --  a decisive victory , a march on Washington , and the absolute destruction of thep134North as a political power . Only then can the South feel secure . Only then will we be able to accomplish our historic mission . " The vision , John thought , the huge dazzling dream , and a gesture on Ules 's part brought his attention to the older man 's hands . They were big hands , covered with a thick mat of coarse , almost colorless hair , and something about them  --  John could n't say what  --  gave off a suggestion of cruelty . Ules wanted nothing for himself , only to see his vision come true , but in the service of his vision he would stop at nothing . John had never before thought of him as a fanatic , but now he did . " Let me see if I understand you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not arguing if there 's going to be a war . What you 're saying is there has to be one . Is that correct ? " " Yes sir , it is , " Ules answered . " Without a war , we stand as we are . And as long as the North exists as a political unit , we have an enemy at our backs . Our leaders are foolish to seek a peaceful separation . They are even more foolish to believe that a slave South can exist side by side with a free North . The Northern President-elect sees the situationfar more clearly . Criminal though he is , I am forced to agree with him . He is right to believe that this country can not endure half slave and half free . It must be the one or the other . Our task is greater than our leaders seem to realize . It is not enough for us to maintain a slave South . We must direct our energies to the creation of a slave nation . " Once again , as on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society , John Bottomley found it hard to believe his ears . " A slave nation ? " he said . " The whole country ? " and instantly he regretted having spoken . Ules Monckton looked at him , his eyes gone blank for the instant , filled with a kind of spectral emptiness , and it needed only that to make John understand he stood beyond the limits of toleration . Ules Monckton knew all about him , and all he knew he held in contempt . " You seem astonished , Mr. Bottomley , " Ules said , and his voice hardened . " Does the concept of a slave nation seem fantastic to you ? "  |p135Unlike  Clay Vincent , Ules Monckton knew how to keep his voice clown . What he was saying , however , was being carefully listened to  --  a scrap here and a scrap there : that was how Pompey 's Head learned about Ules Monckton . For the second time since he entered the room , John found himself at the center of attention . Conversation dropped down to nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , again could plainly be heard . John recognized the schottische as " La Fete des Gondoliers . " He followed the tune for a moment or two , recalling that Missy had been playing it lately on the piano , and then it was time to say if the concept of a slave nation seemed fantastic to him . The whole room was waiting . " Yes sir , " he said . " It does . " Though he knew it was only his imagination , the walls seemed to shiver and then stand still . Ules Monckton said , " So I had an inkling , Mr. Bottomley , " and the tone of his voice could not have been more maddeningly disdainful . " I must apologize , sir , for having brought up what must have been a most unwelcome subject . But I am sorry that you are not with us . The South needs all her sons . " It stung like a slap . John felt a hot stain spreading across his cheeks . He had not said he was not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a slave nation seemed fantastic to him . But still he had been made to appear the worst kind of traitor . A black spout of anger spewed up in him , blurring his eyes . He said , " You will please not to take it upon yourself to judge me , sir . I find it offensive , " and though he tried hard to get hold of himself he could not . " And let me say this , sir ! " he heard his loud , unnatural voice go on . " WhateverI do , whatever I say , is done and said in my own right and under toy own name . There is at least one gentleman in this room who can not claim as much ! " Who was more shocked , himself or Ules Monckton , John would have found it hard to say . Ules 's face went ashen and his eyes absolutelydead , and though John could see that what he had been driven to do was now accomplished ( " He 'll now think twice before he insults me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been worth it ? For what he hadp136clone was monstrous : this was a slash that cut through the bare quiveringtissues of a man 's pride , down to the naked bone . And now that the damage was done  --  this thing that could never be undone  --  John was able to understand what he might have comprehended all along . As clearly as if there had been an open confession , he realized that Ules Monckton had long since come to regret that march on the courthouse . For years now he must have been aware that what had been achieved as Monckton could just as well have been attained as Simpson , and in a sense more honorably . It must have been the only time he had let himself be persuaded into a set of values not his own , when some frustrated hankering to assert his equality with the plantationelite had got the upper hand , and when , foolishly , he had let himself be betrayed into believing that by assuming a distant connection'sname he might cloak his worth , as yet unproved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've truly done it , " John thought . " He 'll want me dead for sure , " and even as the words were forming in his mind , Ules Monckton hit him in the face . He reeled with the blow , falling against Clay Vincent , and when he regained his balance Ules Monckton 's fist was still clenched . Ules said : " Doubtless , sir , you will require satisfaction . Should you , I will be at your disposal . " John thought it was rather like a nightmare . The last thing he wanted was to lift a pistol and fire at Ules Monckton , and even less did he want Ules Monckton lifting a pistol and firing at him . It could n't be true , yet obviously it was true , and there was only one thing to say . " Thank you , Mr. Monckton . I will see that matters are arranged . " Ile hoped he had got it right , since there were certain formalities to be observed , but still it was like a nightmare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the other gentlemen were finding it necessary to hurry off to the ballroom , and then , without quite being able to remember what had happened in between , he found himself back at the punch bowl with Robert Blackfordand Clay Vincent and Jeremiah Lake , having another drink . Hep137heard Clay say , " Do n't forget you 'll need a second , " and Robert , " I 'll be glad to arrange the details if you want me to , " and Jeremiah , " He gave you no choice , John . You had to stand up to him , " and a chill ran down his back . He thought that it was most probably the punch . The committee in charge of refreshments liked to have it icy cold.  |p138That  he must fight a duel with Ules Monckton was still unreal to John Bottomley , but as he made his way to the stables behind his father 's house on the morning after the Light Infantry Ball , no longer did he feel that he was moving quite so completely in a nightmare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him dead , since it would take years for that much hatred to spend itself , but at the same time he could not believe that Ules would actually try to kill him . Prone as man was to violence , there were all sorts of barriers that society had erected against violence , and murder was still murder , even when accomplishedin a duel . His own mind was made up . He would fire into the air and let it go at that . And if by any chance Ules Monckton had other ideas and truly intended to kill him  --  well , in that case it was best not to think of it . Calm gave way to the most loathsome kind of fear . He had been through that once , when for more than an hour in the middle of the night he would have been willing to endure the most humiliatingdebasement in order not to die , and he would not permit himself to go through anything that squalid again . If he could not meet death bravely , at least he could pretend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been easier , however . Never had earth or morning seemed so fair . Each blade of grass stood out , each shrub , each tree , and when he entered the stable , where the sheltered shapes of darknesswere just beginning to take on form and definition in the dim half-light that filtered through the small square windows , and the sleepy noises of the horses rose into the warm smells of hay andp140manure , there was such a containment of wonder and so much to love and live for that he had to stand still for a moment , wanting to bow his head . Sensing his presence , the horses began to move about more purposefully . John spoke to them as he walked along the row of stalls , stopping once to pat an ancient mare named Delilah who had been foaling since he was a boy , and when eventually he went into the tackroomto get his saddle he was startled by the curled-up shape of a full-grown Negro boy snoring gently on the floor . In his sleep , lying on one side with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crook of an arm , the boy looked like a bundle of rags . His name was Simon . There was no reason for him not to be where he was , since Corwin Bottomley would no more leave his stable unguarded than he would his house , but neither need he be asleep on the floor . A good cot had been set up for him in an empty stall . He had simply gone to sleep where sleep had overcome him . You were always coming across them like that , sometimes in the most unlikely places , and how was it possible not to despair ? Give them a cot and warm blankets , and still they would sleep on the floor . Do all you could to get them to keep their cabins and their persons clean , and it was as hopeless as if you never tried . Trust them enough not to lock them up at curfew , and half the compound would go sneakingoff for a night of voodoo in the swamps . Cast in the shapes of men , they seemed almost determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were fit for ? Sometimes you had to think so . But there was the ragged Simon , snoring on the floor . John 's hoot hit against the door of the tackroom , and suddenly the boy awoke . He jumped to his feet , instantly and wholly alert , and his shape was the shape of a human being  --  no matter where you began , you always came back to that : try as you might to avoid it , it forever blocked your path . Simon said , " Morning , maussuh . Who you going to ride today ? Old Nellie ? " and what the trouble was , the largest of all the troubles , was that you could never see them plain . Slavery was like a curtain , you on your side and they on theirs , and because of the curtain you were eternally separated.  |p141John  waited for Simon to saddle up , admiring his dexterity , and just before he mounted he reached in his pocket and gave the boy a silver dollar . The richness of the reward left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what Simon did not know , what he could not , Jcnow , was that it was not so much a gift as an impulsive offering to the gods and , beyond that , an effort to find a way through the curtain . But nothing helped . You hoped to be kind and ended by being cruel . It availed nothing to pretend otherwise . Giving a silver dollar to Simon was no more than giving a bucket of oats to old Delilah  --  except that Delilah had the nicer smell  --  and what could be crueler than that ? Or more depressing ? He could be going to meet his Maker , since there was no way of telling what Ules Monckton had in store for him , and there might have been a better preparation . John was to meet Jeremiah Lake and Robert Blackford behind the Blackfords ' barn and to get there had to ride past the Stanhope residence . Standing on a tract of thirty-three and a third acres , as did the other two houses  --  the Bottomleys ' and the Blackfords ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnolias , then by an oaklinedavenue that all three families used to gain access to a wide dirt road that led to the more thickly settled parts of Pompey 's Head , and finally by a sweep of gardens and lawn . Though town houses , all three dwellings looked like country residences . Each was built in the shape of a square , each had a big front porch behind a line of columns , and the general effect of their barns , stables , servants ' quarters , and other outbuildings was that of three small , compact , adjoining plantations . Of the three , however , it was indigo that was the prize . Intended as a monument , it fulfilled its purpose . Corwin Bottomley wanted a big house . Expense did not matter . Indigo was the biggest house anywhere around . Its exquisite proportionssaved it from bulkiness , however , and the six slender columns that supported the roof of the porch , which was actually an extension of the roof of the house itself , gave it a grace and lightness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . Coming to Indigo from his own crude dwelling at Deerskin was one of the happiest pleasures John knew . But not so much as formerly . Everything was different since Lydia had married Senator Stanhope . The first time John visited Indigo after her wedding was agony . IIe soon discovered that he must cast out the images that raged through his mind , lest they destroy him . He no longer permitted them to rise to the surface of consciousness but he knew they were there . Turning his mind in another direction , he soon was at the Blackfords ' . Robert and Jeremiah were waiting on their horses , and Robert carried a shallow , highly polished case under one arm . " Good morning , you fellows , " John said . " I hope von got more sleep than I did . I spent most of the night drawing up my will . " " Rich as you are , I 'm not surprised , " Jeremiah said . " You rememberedme generously , I hope . " " Do n't sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me think you do n't value me for myself , " and he nodded toward the case Robert Blackford was carrying . " What 's in the box , Rob ? Cigars ? " Robert gave a grunt . " Damn if you ai n't a real comedian this morning . You ought to arrange to get yourself called out every day . It makes you a sight more entertaining than generally you are , " and John 's spirits brightened immeasurably . It simply was n't possible that Ulcs Monckton would try to kill him : no man would want that kind of blood on his hands  --  soon they would he having breakfast , and this all would be something to laugh about . " Well , let 's do n't keep the quality waiting , " he said . " The man 's mad enough at me as it is . Which way are we going to ride ? Through town or through the woods ? " They decided on the shorter route of the woods . If they followed the path for a little over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of town , they would emerge only a few blocks from Colonial Square , one of a number of squares laid out during the earliest clays of the colony and the official dueling ground of Pompey 's Head . Not that all differences were settled so formally . What was morep143likely to happen ( though it did not happen often ) was a blaze of gunfireon the street . It was often said that if two gentlemen agreed to meet in Colonial Square it meant they wanted only to go through the motions . On more than one occasion , however , things took a deadlierturn . There were three headstones in the cemetery bearing the names of the deceased and beneath the names the chiseled reminder that they had been KILLED IN A DUEL by so-and-so . Nor was it true , as was sometimes believed , outside the South , that killing a man involvedno penalties . The families of the victorious duelists had lived in the shadow of those somber triumphs ever since . Murder was murder , no matter if accomplished in a duel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Bottomley hoped that Ules Monckton would remember . A ten-minute ride brought the horsemen to the place where the woods ended at the eastern outskirts of Pompey 's Head , two blocks from Colonial Square . At this early hour the streets were deserted . There was such a feeling of dawn , of beds still being slept in and hushed , unawakened rooms , that John Bottomley was more than a little surprised to hear the sound of voices moving toward them . The voices had a ready explanation . They belonged to a gang of Irishmen on their way to work . The men came into view just as John and his companions reached the intersection of one of the side streets . They carried a varied assortment of tools  --  spades , crowbars , pickaxes  --  and though they were of all ages , shapes , and sizes , they were given a sort of regimental alikeness by their faded blue shirts , heavy brogans , and the compounded compactness of their hard muscularity . The fingers of the older men went automatically to their caps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always exchanged good mornings in Pompey 's Head ) , but John noticed that the younger members of the gang kept their free hands at their sides and that one of them , blue-eyed and black-haired and somewhere in his twenties , was staring at him with a kind of deliberate stoniness . It was John who first averted his eyes . More than stoniness hadp144entered the young laborer 's eyes  --  a shaft of pure hatred  --  and John felt he had enough hate to deal with this morning , without inviting any more . As he and his friends rode on , approaching Colonial Square , he saw two men standing beneath the trees , and a pair of horses nibblingat a patch of grass . He did not recognize the shorter and bulkier of the two men , but the other , unmistakably , was Ules Monckton . His throat tightened and there was a small sick feeling at the pit of his stomach , and an old , almost forgotten sequence of words tumbled into his mind , speaking themselves aloud . He turned his head to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one picks up the count of a clock that has already begun to strike , and he recognized them as the prayer he used to say as a child before Missy was born : God bless Mama and God bless Papa and God bless my little brother Cameronand God bless Moon and Zeke and Ellie May and all our other people and make me a good boy . Amen . He braced his shoulders as he reined up in the square and held them braced as he dismounted , and though it could n't be true it was true , and as bad a nightmare as ever . There were bows and introductionsall around . The man with Ules Monckton turned out to be his brother Gup , and it was a measure of Ules 's solitariness that he had only his brother to act for him , and off at the far end of the square , standing all alone , there was someone who was plainly Gordon Carpenter , but what was Gordon Carpenter doing there , holding a small black satchel ? Jeremiah Lake drew Gup Monckton off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their heads together , speaking in subdued tones , reminded John of a pair of conspirators he had seen in a play one evening in Philadelphia when he attended the theatre with Miss Clarissa Drew  --  The Gladiators , it was called . Edwin Forrestwas in it , and Jeremiah Lake and Gup Monckton might well be figures on a stage . JEREMIAH LAKE : I believe , sir , that were it urged strongly enough , an apology might be arranged . But only , of course , if we are assured of an apology in return . GUI ' MONCKTON ( frowning ) : I am afraid that we would be wast/ing our time , sir . There are some occasions when an apology will not suffice . This is one of them . JEREMIAH LAKE : You take a strong position , Mr. Monckton . Am I to understand that our offer has been declined ? GUP MONCKTON ( stiffly ) : I have been given a set of instructions , sir . I have no authority to go beyond them . JEREMIAH LAKE : Your answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . JEREMIAI LAKE : In that case , we 'd best pass on to the details . Would thirty paces be satisfactory to your principal ? GUP MONCKTON : It would . JEREMIAH LAKE : And shall we agree to a simultaneous firing at the moment of turning ? GUP MONCKTON : No , I think not , Mr. Lake . I believe that according to the rules we have the choice in that regard . Our preference is for a count of five . JEREMIAH LAKE ( after a pause ) : Very well , sir . As you say , the choice is yours . Would it be satisfactory if Mr. Blackford does the counting ? GUP MONCKTON : Yes sir , it would . JEREMIAH LAKE : That takes care of everything , does it not ? GUP MONCKTON : I believe it does . JEREMIAH LAKE : My compliments to your brother , Mr. Monckton . CUP MONCKTON : And mine to your friend , Mr. Lake . Gup Monckton bowed , and Jeremiah Lake bowed in return , and Joliil thought that more than ever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apology , John , " Jeremiah Lake said . " Our offer was declined . And the way it 's to be worked is this  --  you and Mr. Monckton will step off thirty paces , turn , take aim , and wait until Robert counts up to five before you fire . Is everything clear ? "  |p146John  nodded , because it was clear , but not nearly so clear as The Gladiators , Miss Clarissa Drew , and the painted arches of the Colosseum . Jeremiah Lake withdrew , Robert Blackford stepped forward , and John found himself facing Ules Monckton across the handsomest pair of pistols he had ever seen , the long barrels smooth as satin and the graceful curves of the handles sheathed in mother-of-pearl . The floor of the case was lined with wine-colored velvet , and a small label was pasted inside the cover . The weapons must have cost a fortune , and John wondered where Robert had got them . " Mr. Monckton , " Robert said . John saw Ules Monckton 's right hand reach out and take up one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that covered the backs of his hands looked coarse and lifeless in the dull morning light . " Mr. Bottomley , " Robert said . " Mr. Bottomley . " What Robert wanted him to do was to take the second pistol , as well he knew , and he started to explain that if his attention had seemed to stray it was because it had been drawn to the label on the inside of the cover  --  " HALL &; FARRADAY , " it said , " 5 Whitefriars Street , London , Detonation on the Latest Principle , " and he realized that Robert must have bought the pistols on his recent trip to London . " Mr. Bottomley , " Robert repeated . " Mr. Bottomley . " It dawned on him that he was standing as though stupefied , which was n't at all true , since his senses could n't have been keener , and he picked up the pistol . Thirty paces , Jeremiah Lake said . He must remember to keep accurate count . He could ill afford to turn around at twenty-eight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite direction . They would never let him forget it at the club . He could imagine the sort of joke they would be crackingat his expense  --  " Some fellows are quick on the draw , but Bottomleyhere , he 's quick on the turn . " Robert Blackford said , " Please remember , gentlemen , that you are not to fire until I reach the count of five , " and what John found most curious , as he and Ules Monckton took up their places back to back ( my little brother Cameron and Moon and Zeke and Ellie May andp147all our other people ) , was that he could see Ules 's face just as plain as if they were looking at each other . It was on the tip of his tongue to say , " Good hunting , Mr. Monckton . Do n't get buck fever , " and perhaps he would have , if only to show how calm he was , but there was n't enough time . Robert Blackford said , " Are you ready , gentlemen ? Prepare to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep his mind on the count  --  one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight  --  and he had never realized how much moss there was in the trees of the square ( and make me a good boy . Amen ) . At the count of thirty he turned . Ules Monckton turned also and raised his pistol , and even at that distance John could see the flat , empty look in his eyes . " One , " Robert Blackford 's voice said , " two , " and when John sighted Ulcs Monckton 's forehead along the barrel he knew that all he need do was to squeeze the trigger and Ules was a dead man  --  you could nearly always tell when you were going to shoot well , and this was one of the times , and with a pistol like this he could hit a pine cone at thirty paces , much less Ules Monckton . The nightmare took on a new , more frightening dimension  --  a squeeze of the finger and Ules Monckton would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackford 's voice said , " four , " and John relaxed his arm so that he could swing the pistol upward and discharge the bullet into the air . Robert Blackford 's voice said , " Five ! " and the two charges exploded at almost the same instant , rocketing across the square . John felt a thud of pain centering in a core of numbness where his right elbow used to be , and what happened , he realized , was that his head had been aimed at and that the bullet , going slightly wide of the mark , had found a target in his elbow , which had been momentarily left exposed when he raised his arm to fire . " He wanted to kill me , " he thought . " Ile really did , " and the small sick feeling at the pit of his stomach became a larger sick feeling , which turned into terror , and the terror was so agonizing that he wanted to turn and run before Ules Monckton could shoot him again . Waves of dizziness danced before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " I think he 's pleased . He got a lucky hit and stillp148he 's pleased ! " ) and suddenly the terror was no more . After so much fear he did not think he would ever be fearful again . He reached for his elbow with his free hand . It came away smeared with blood , and as he stared at it , unable to do anything to alter the dazed expression on his face ( " He 's ruined my arm . I 'll be a cripple . I 'll be useless if war comes " ) , the years of doubt and uncertainty were over . He would have to stand with the South . His involvement was too intense . He now knew where he stood , irrevocably , and he supposedhe had Ules Monckton to thank for it . It must have been then that he fainted . He could not have been unconscious for long , however , for soon someone was trying to get him to swallow from a flask of brandy . He recognized it as brandy by the smell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice said . " How bad is it ? " " Bad enough , " a second voice replied . " Look at those splinters of bone . This is a compound fracture if ever I saw one . We have to get him to the office . " John recognized the first voice as Robert Blackford 's and the secondas Gordon Carpenter 's , and what Gordon was doing there , as he might have known all along , was simply to be on hand should a physician happen to be needed . " What do you think , Gordon ? " he heard Jeremiah Lake say . " Should I borrow a carriage somewhere ? " and much as he wanted to explain that he was quite capable of ridinghis horse and please not to bother anyone at this inhumane hour , he could n't get out the words . He managed to swallow some of the brandy , but it went down the wrong way and made him cough . It was the cough , as much as the brandy , that brought him to . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coal oil and lye ? Is that the best you can do for a dying man ? " " Well ! " Robert Blackford said . " Our comedian is back with us again . " Robert and Jeremiah helped him to his feet , and he found that although he was a little unsteady and dizzy he was able to stand . He might have been dead , however , and it was Ules Monckton whop149had wanted to kill him , and for a moment he thought he was going to faint again . He waited for it to happen , and then , when it did not , he noticed that the sun had risen . That was the big thing . The glorious thing . The sun had risen and he was there to sec it . He could tell it was going to be a fine , bright day.  | " Johnny , you 're back ! " Missy cried , gathering up her skirts and runninginto John 's bedroom . " Did you find out anything about Cameron ? And your arm ? How is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was past midnight and nearly two weeks after John 's duel . Though he still had to carry his arm in a sling , he could move about fairly comfortably . For six days he had been on a trip to Deerskin and Cornwall plantations , returning to Pompey 's Head late that eveningon the Serena Moore , and Missy had just come in from a dance given by the Palmetto Rifles . She gave him a quick hug , taking care not to press against his sling . " Tell me about your trip , " she said , looking around for a place to sit . " What happened ? Did you learn anything at Cornwall ? " John 's excuse for leaving Pompey 's Head had been that he wanted to look after the neglected affairs of Deerskin . Missy , however , knew better . She understood his real reason had been to visit Cornwall . Needing someone to talk to about Cameron , John had taken her into his confidence . Their father refused to mention Cameron 's name , and kindness suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety had proved too much for her . Dr. Carpenter had prescribed laudanum and ordered her to remain in bed . That left Missy . She might not be able to help , but at least she could listen . One night after supper she had come into the library , where John was trying to read by the fire . It was five days after his duel . John 's book was The Mill on the Floss , a new novel by an Englishwoman named George Eliot . The author 's private life had recently blownp154like a storm through the meetings of the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society . The word was that she had formed an alliance with a man not her husband . According to Missy , some of the ladies refused to read her any longer . Six states had left the Union , and a constitutional convention was about to be held in the city of Montgomery , Alabama , but it was George Eliot 's unnerving alliance that caused stitches to be dropped and set teacups to rattling in their saucers . John could not keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seceded , it could no longer be hoped that the Union would stand . " We 'll die first ! " the mood now was . " Ask us to submit to anything , any tyranny , any despotism , but do not ask us to rejoin the Union ! " The sentiment , if not the language , seemed everywhere the same . If there were any voices of moderation left , they no longer were heard . The line between moderation and treason was drawn very fine . Only that morning the News had carried an account of a commercial traveler who had narrowly missed being hanged as a spy . It turned out he was a St. Louis man who had been overheard to say in the lobby of the Commercial Hotel that he was sorry to see the old Union go . The News noted approvingly that he had been hustled out of town . John closed The Mill on the Floss and looked into the fire . What was he going to do with himself if war broke out , and what about Cameron ? Somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't disappear , he told himself . Cameron was bound to have left some trace , some clue . How , though , to find it ? It seemed an impossibletask . A large piece of coal fell apart in the fire , sending out ribbons of flame , and John decided he had best make a trip to Cornwall . A search of Cameron 's room had yielded nothing but a batch of unpaid bills and several empty whisky bottles hidden in a bureau drawer . Though Cameron had lately been spending most of his time in town , Cornwall was where he had lived . Something more revealing might be turned up there . John had just resolved to go upriver on the Serena Moore when Missy walked into the library . The Mannings were having an eveningp155of amateur theatricals , and she was going there with Gordon Carpenter . Her face was clouded and there was a tired expression around her eyes . " Mama 's asleep and Papa 's gone to the club , " she said . " I wish I did n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Cameron , have n't you ? " John was momentarily astonished that Missy was so well able to read his thoughts , and then he found no reason to be  --  ask anyone in the Bottomley family these days what he was thinking about , and the answer was almost certain to be Cameron . " Could you sit a minute ? " he said . " There are a few questions I 'd like to ask . " " About Cam ? " " Yes , about Cam . And do n't say it like that . It 's foolish of us to shy away from speaking of him . We ca n't evade what 's happened forever . And another thing . We might as well face the fact that wherever he has gone to he is n't going to return . If he was , he would have by now . " " It 's too horrible , Johnny . What are we going to do ? " " There 's only one thing we can do . Try to find him . " " How ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . What I 'm hoping is that we can learn what made him run away . My idea is that since we have to begin somewhere that 's the place . " " It 's hopeless . " " Possibly . But still we have to try . " " Does your arm hurt ? " " Some , but we 're not talking about my arm . " " I hate that man . " " No , you do n't hate anyone . It was more my fault than his . " " Your fault ! " " Yes , Missy . I lost my temper and said something I should n't have . There were other things I might have said  --  better things , actually  --  but some low meanness in me made me seize on that . ' What I was after , I suppose , without really knowing it , was to destroy a man 's pride . Under those circumstances , it was not too unnatural for himp156to want to destroy me . So you do n't hate anybody . There 's enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , affectionate look . " Your trouble is that you 're too good . Everything is always your fault , never anybody else 's . But I love you for being the way you are . It 's just like Arbell says . " " Must you always bring her into everything ? " " This is n't everything . What she said was that there 's nobody as good as you . And brave , too . She says she ca n't imagine anyone being as brave as you were when you had your duel . Is n't that nice ? " " It 's Cam we 're talking about , not Arabella . Did he and Kitty have a quarrel ? Did anything go wrong there ? " " I do n't think so . " " Are you sure ? " " As sure as anyone can be of a thing like that . Of course they could have had a quarrel without letting onto it , but I do n't think so . They would have been almost bound to give it away . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else that might have gone wrong with Cam , do you ? " Missy shook her head . " No , Johnny , no one thing in particular . He was drinking too much , and he always seemed to need money , but you know more about that than I do . That day he stopped off to see you at Deerskin  --  he asked you for money then , did n't he ? " " How did you know ? " " Do I have to say ? " " I wish you would . " " He asked me for money . That was before he went to Cornwall . " " How much did you give him ? " " Do I have to say again ? " " Well , since you 've gone this far --  " " All right . It was eighteen dollars . I had it left over from Christmas . " " Did that happen often ? " " What ? " " His asking you for money . " " No , not often . But Mama , though  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the door . " You wo n't tell her I told you , will you ? Or Papa ? He 'd be furious . " " About what ? " " Mama 's rent money from the Channel . You know those houses she owns there ? Sometimes she 'd let Cam collect the rent money and keep it . " " But what about Mr. Roundtree ? He 's her rent collector . How did they get around him ? " " Mr. Roundtree has been sick on and off the past three years . Cam would collect the rent in his place . Since it was Mama 's money , Papa never knew . " Except as a reminder of Cameron 's indifference as to how he got hold of money , so long as he got hold of it , John did not think it sounded particularly important . " I ca n't see it tells us anything about Cam we do n't already know . What I 'm trying to get at is this  --  what was it that went wrong with Cam and when did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny . It 's hopeless , I tell you . We 're not de-tectives . " " No , that we surely are n't . I told Father that we ought to call in a detective , a good one , even if we had to hire him from up North somewhere , but it only made him angry . What I think is that he 's afraid of what a detective might turn up . " " Is it that bad ? " " How do I know ? On the face of it , it would seem bad enough . Why else would Cam want to run away ? Let me ask you this . Did you notice anything special about his behavior after he returned from Cornwall ? Did it seem peculiar in any way ? " " What ? " " Were n't you listening ? " " Yes , but I was thinking how bad you need a haircut . You ought to go to the barber . " " For heaven 's sake , Missy ! What difference does my needing a haircutmake ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behavior when he returned from Cornwall ? The next day , for instance . That would have been a Sunday . "  | " A Sunday ? Was n't that when the Blackfords had their picnic ? " " Was it ? " " Yes , that 's when it was . " " Was Cam there ? " " At the picnic ? Yes , he brought Kitty . " " I-Iow did he seem ? " " Very nice . A little quiet , maybe even a little sad , but nice . He was specially nice to Kitty . " " Was n't he always ? " Missy hesitated an instant . " No , Johnny , not always . Not that he was ever deliberately unkind to her . I do n't mean that . It was more that he was  --  well , thoughtless . You know how he is . " " Oh yes . I know how he is all right ! " " Do n't say it like that , Johnny . You sound like Papa . And there 's nothing mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being thoughtless . You know that . " It was the same old story all over again , John thought . No matter what Cameron 's transgressions , there would always be someone to find excuses for him . And it was n't true what Missy said about Cameron'snot being mean  --  he could be as mean as anyone and , when the mood was on him , meaner than most . John said , " Let 's get back to where we were . You say he seemed all right at the Blackfords ' picnic . What about that night ? Did he stay out late ? " " No , he did n't , " Missy said . " That much I 'm positive of , and the reason I 'm positive is that after the picnic he and Kitty came back here . Mrs. Williams and Gordon were here too . We all came home in the same carriage . Elnora made some coffee and brought us the rest of the fruitcake Aunt Mary Nesbitt sent for Christmas . " " And then ? " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . I was still downstairs when Cam got back . he could n't have been gone more than fifteen minutes . We finished the last of the fruit-cake . " " It sounds like a nice day . "  | " It was . When I think of those hateful Yankees and how they want to come down here and ruin everything --  " " Like what ? All-day picnics and Aunt Mary Nesbitt 's fruitcake ? Let 's not get off on the Yankees . " " Tell me something , Johnny . What is it about you and the Yankees ? Nearly everybody else gets so mad they ca n't see straight , but you never seem to lose your temper even a little . Is it because of that girl in Philadelphia ? Are you still in love with her ? " " No , I 'm not still in love with her , and it 's because of a lot of things . It would be more profitable if we went back to the fruitcake . Because of it and the Blackfords ' picnic , Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know something about what happenedon Monday already . Cam cashed my check first thing in the morning --  " So it was a check you gave him . " " Yes . " " Was it for a lot ? " " Tor me it was . But try to follow what I 'm saying . Cam cashed my check first thing Monday morning , came back here , and spent most of the day in his room . And it was that evening , when he came down to supper  --  rather the worse for wear , I gather  --  that he and Fatherran head on into each other . As best you can remember , did Cam say anything that might have indicated --  " Missy sat up straighter . " Do n't make me talk about it , Johnny . I wish I had n't been there . It 's bad enough when you see someone you do n't know who 's drunk , some stranger on the streets , but when it 's your own brother , and drunker than you ever dreamed anyone could be --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to put yourself through that again . I think it 's fairly clear . " " What is ? " " That whatever Cam got into , he got into before he went to Cornwall . I suspected as much already . He was in rather bad shape when I saw him at Deerskin . I should have known that something was wrong . And if only --  "  | " Yes ? If only ? " " If only I had had sense enough to realize he was in trouble . That , though , is water under the bridge . Let 's see where we are . Cam stopped off at Deerskin on a Saturday . Ile 'd gone to Cornwall the day before , which was a Friday , and that was the Friday before the Light Infantry Ball . The ball was on the eighteenth , so a week before that would make it the eleventh . January eleventh . Whatever happened would then seem to have happened before January eleventh . It does n't tell us much , but it tells us something . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is n't hard , I promise . Put it down to keeping a set of plantation books for ten years  --  if I 'm really thinking straight , that is . Can you remember as far back as January eleventh ? " " I can try . " " All right , then . If we are on the right track and what happened to Cam happened before January eleventh , some kind of change must have come over him . After the eleventh . At some point or other he must have seemed not himself . Moody , disconsolate , worried about something . Can you remember anything about that ? " Missy thought a moment and shook her head . " No , Johnny , I ca n't . The truth is that I was too busy to pay much mind to Cam . The ball was coming up , and there were a lot of other parties , and Mama and I were having some new dresses made , and I just did n't pay much mind to him , that 's all . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be foolish . Why go out of your way to borrow blame ? Let 's try to get at it another way . If you ca n't remember Cameron 's seemingmoody or depressed , perhaps you can remember when it was he last seemed in especially good spirits . You know what I mean , do n't you ? Particularly gay . Helling around with that crowd of his . Can you remember ? " " Let me see . " Missy drew her brows together , thinking hard , and then her face brightened . " Yes ! I know now ! It was the night he and Gordon and Tony Blackford and some of the others --  Did n't you hear about it ? " " Hear about what ? "  | " What they did . You must have heard about the fires . " " Fires ? What fires ? " And then John remembered . " You mean the night they burned down the outhouses ? Truly , Missy , I think you 're old enough to mention outhouses in front of your own brother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of all the trouble I got into because of Tommy Vincent 's mumps --  " " Tommy Vincent 's mumps were a different matter entirely . " " You see ! You make me tired ! " " That I do n't doubt . Having your innocence protected must be a great trial at times . " " Innocence my foot ! " " Take that attitude toward innocence , my child , and you 'll end up like those Yankee women who are said to believe in free love . " " Johnny ! " " Just do n't say you were n't warned , that 's all . When was the night of the great conflagration ? " " I have to think . I remember I was spending the night with Arbell and went to early Sunday service with her next morning . That would make it Saturday , would n't it ? Yes , that 's when it was . The Saturday two weeks before the ball . " " And the Saturday , then , before the eleventh . If the eleventh fell on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth . No , the fifth . January fifth . That gives us from the fifth to the eleventh . Certainly nothing seemed to be bothering Cam the night of the fifth , and on the morning of the eleventh he left for Cornwall . That leaves us the five days from the sixth through the tenth . " Missy gave him another affectionate look . " I think you 're wonderful . Papa 's right . We do n't need a detective . No detective could be any better than you . What are you going to do now ? " iiIt was then John confided his decision to go to Cornwall . Two ( lays later he left Pompey 's Head on the Serena Moore , and now , back at Indigo after his six-day absence , Missy was asking did he find out anything about Cameron.  |p162John  did not know what to tell her . He might have learned something about his brother , and he might not have  --  a crumpled sheet of foolscap on which Cameron had apparently been trying to cast up some accounts and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several times amid a nest of whorls , spirals , and other scratchings ; the same letter , looking more like an M than a W this time , inscribed more elaborately on the back of an envelope ; and a bundle of rough , coarse clothes , almost new , that had been thrown into the corner of a closet  --  possibly it might mean something , and again it might n't . Missy 's disappointed look made him sorry he felt obliged to shut her out . The letter M or X/ , however , urged him to be cautious . Missy 's instinctive response , were he to mention it , would be to see it as the first letter of some girl 's name . Once let her get that idea and nothing could keep her from launching an investigation of her own . Which meant she would start asking questions and talk the whole thing over with Arabella Stanhope , and in less than twenty-four hours it would be all over town that Cameron had thrown over Kitty Williams and run off with some mysterious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Missy asked . " Anything at all ? " Other than the sheet of foolscap and the envelope , there was only the bundle of clothes  --  cheap woolen pants , a blue cotton shirt , a cloth cap , and a pair of heavy brogans . " You 're keeping something from me , " Missy said . " I can tell . " " No , I 'm not . I was thinking of some clothes I found in Cam 's closet . " " Clothes ? What kind of clothes ? " " Those on the chair by the bed . I brought them back with me . " He crossed the room and held up the garments one by one . " Did you ever sec these before ? " " They look like some darky 's to me . " " That 's what I thought . But I found them in Cam 's closet , the one in his bedroom . " " Those are n't Cam 's . He would n't be caught dead in them . And that 's all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John hit his wounded elbow against one of the bedposts . The pain made him grit his teeth . " Your poor arm , " Missy said . " Does it hurt ? " " When I give it a crack like that it does . What do you say we go to sleep ? It must be nearly one . " " Oh , it 's way past one . I did n't get home till quarter after . " " Do n't be so proud about it . All the more reason you should be asleep . " " Oh , stop it , Johnny ! Do n't try to sound like Papa . I 'm not afraid of that big deep voice of yours . " " I do n't ask you to be . All I ask is that you let us get to sleep . " " Nothing could be further from my mind , " Missy said . " I 'm going to stay and talk with you some more , and then I 'll wake Elnora and have her fix me something to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pages in my diary . It will be daylight before I close my devastating eyes . Did you know I have devastating eyes ? " She blinked several times , enjoying her own silliness , and John imaginedthat if you were almost nineteen and remarkably pretty , with wheat-colored hair and a turned-up nose and bright , dark eyes , it was probably difficult to stay unhappy for long . He said , " Your devastating eyes , eh ? That 's not Gordon Carpenter , I 'm sure . Are you playing him false already ? " " Do n't be impertinent , silly . All I 'm doing is to make him a little jealous . He must n't think he 's the only one in love with me . Do you want to hear about the dance ? " " Not specially . " " Good ! I knew you would . Do you want to hear it from the beginning , or shall I just tell about my great success ? " " You 're a small idiot . You know that , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . I can think of at least four or five gentlemen who would be pleased to disagree with you . " " So ! At least four or five . Is Gordon still speaking to you ? " " Speaking to me ? Only now is he beginning to appreciate me ! " Her face lighted up and she gave herself a hug . " Oh , I 'm so happy ,  |p164Johnny  ! Is it wrong of me ? With Cameron gone and all our other troubles , I mean ? Is it ? " " Do n't be an even worse idiot . Tell me more about the dance . " " You did n't think I was through , did you ? And you did n't get a haircut , either . " " No , I did n't have time . " " Well , you 'd best soon . A few more days and you 'll be able to wear braids like our noble ancestor Chief Tupichichi . Why is it that Papa always calls him noble ? " " Ile was the head man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But did that make him noble ? Really , I mean . If he was anything like those Indians who used to trap in the swamps near Rosebank , I 'll bet he smelled . " " You 'd best not express that opinion to your father . " " Am I mad ? How far away from being Indian are we , Johnny ? Seven generations ? " " Yes , why ? " " No reason . It just happened to cross my mind , that 's all . I hardly ever think of Tupichichi 's being in the family , or Mary , his daughter , the one who ran around without too many clothes on , or about our having Indian blood . And none of us look Indiany , do we ? Except maybe you when you let your hair grow so long . " " Come on , Missy . Stop your chattering . Let 's go to sleep . " " But it 's true ! You do look a little Indiany , even with your nice gray eyes . My big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little , giddy , harum-scarum sister Missy . You do have an intelligence , I know , but sometimes it reminds me of a bird with a broken wing . " " I like that ! Oh , what an ugly thing to say ! If I were n't so fond of you I 'd start despising you this instant ! And I 'm not at all sure I would like you in braids . Why is it you always look so shaggy ? Even at the ball you did . Do n't you like going to the barber ? " " Right now I 'd rather go to bed . I 've had a long day . " " No , Johnny , not yet ! Please . I have n't told you the most important thing . Guess who was with Arbell at the dance tonight . "  | " Look , Missy ! I had to get up at dawn this morning , and the Serena broke down twice . We did n't tie up until almost midnight . If you imagine that all I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance tonight --  " " But wait , Johnny ! It 's not what you think . Arbell was with a gentleman from New Orleans  --  a Mr. Livingston Hall . " " Was she now ? I will admit New Orleans is a long way off , and it 's interesting to know she has widened her range of operations , but I ca n't say I 'm impressed . Does Mr. Livingston Hall know that his has been added to the largest collection of scalps this side the Great Plains ? " Missy looked hurt . " I knew it ! I just knew you 'd say something like that ! That is n't like you , Johnny . It really is n't . You 've no cause to talk that way about Arbell . Just let me mention her name , and right away you start getting ugly and mean . Besides , it 's not what you think . Mr. Hall is most as old as Senator Stanhope . He did n't take Arbell to the dance . He was just with her . Julian Fitzpatrick took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on business . " " What kind of business ? " " He owns a huge cotton plantation somewhere above New Orleans , and Senator Stanhope is buying it . They say it 's going to cost him nearly a quarter of a million dollars . " John 's interest began to pick up . Though he had heard the Senatorwas thinking of investing in the fertile cotton lands along the lower Mississippi ( urged on by Lydia , it was said ) , this was the first definite word he had of it . Any number of planters had put large sums of money into cotton plantations farther west . Corwin Bottomley was one of the few who resisted the trend . His was the earlier low-country belief , almost mystic , that a planter 's proper crop was rice . Cotton might be admitted were it of the sea-island variety grown on the chain of islands that stretched along the coast . Cotton farther west , however , in the Yazoo-Mississippi delta and elsewhere , meant a crowd of pushing , get-rich-quick fellows who made the mistake of believing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old.  | " You see ! " Missy said . " I told you it was n't what you thought ! Are n't you sorry you said all those mean things about Arbell ? " " Yes , if you want me to be . Who told you that this plantation is costing the Senator nearly a quarter million ? " " Selph Lockhart . " " Since Mr. Lockhart is the Senator 's factor , Selph ought to know . It 's probably nowhere near a quarter million , not by fifty thousand or so , but even at that it is n't petty cash . Where is the Senator gettingthe money ? " Missy was eager to tell . " He 's selling a lot of stocks and bonds he owns up North , and also a tract of woodland . The rest he 's going to borrow . Selph told me that too . " " You and Selph must have had a nice statistical evening . When did he get it in about your devastating eyes ? " " How do you --  " " It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose the Senator knows what he 's doing . It seems to be a good deal of money to be putting into cotton land , though , especially at a time like this . " " But everybody says --  " " Indeed they do . Did n't you read the editorial in yesterday 's News ? Already king , cotton will soon be czar . Lowell , Massachusetts , has to have six hundred thousand bales a year . Leeds and Manchester in England are absolutely dependent on it . Let the South hold back its cotton for only two or three months , and prices will go soaring to as much as fifteen cents a pound . " " Is that a lot ? " " That , Missy , is beyond man 's wildest dreams of avarice . You do n't think the Senator is going into cotton as a hobby , do you ? You should read Gup Monckton more carefully . The estimated value of our annual cotton crop is two hundred million dollars . On this the North makes at least ten million by advances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from now on , instead of lining foreign pockets --  " " Oh petunia , Johnny ! Who cares about all that stuff ? " " You 'd be astonished . "  | " Well , I do n't . It makes my head swim . Do you want something to eat ? There 's some ham and cold turkey , and I think a peach pie . I 'll get Elnora to fix it in the library . We can have it by the fire . " " Must you wake Elnora ? " " She 'll be cross as two sticks if I do n't . You know that . " Missy 's old nurse , Elnora was now her maid , confidante , and watchdog . She slept in a small bedroom adjoining Missy 's . She was fat , jealous , privileged , domineering , wildly superstitious , and apt to be bad-tempered with everyone but her charge . " It 's all right about Elnora , " Missy said . " I 'll have to wake her to help me undress anyway . Besides , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her to make some coffee ? " " Well , " John said , " if you 're going to bribe me with coffee , " and that was as far as he got  --  a scream ripped through the house , followed by another . Missy turned white as death . She jumped to her feet and moved swiftly toward the door . " Dear God it 's Mama again ! " she said . " What is it this time ? " John 's parents slept on the second floor of Indigo , the others on the third . John hastened from his bedroom and started running toward the stairway at the end of the hall . Missy came flying after him , and behind her he could hear Elnora calling out something in a frightened , unintelligible voice that , as past experience reminded him , would in another instant also be a scream  --  there it came now , wild and piercing , and as often as this had happened , much as it was part of the life of Indigo , it never failed to make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spells , " they would call it in the morning , folding it into the recollection of her other spells  --  the time she thought the soup was poisoned , the time she heard someone crawling on the roof , the several times she detected prowlers on the lawn , and the who could say how many times she spied a black midnight face on a ladder by the window . " Poor Mama , " they would say in the morning . " It 's too bad she has these spells . " But it was many hours till morning : at times like this , one wondered if morning would ever come  --  as John raced down the stairs , with Missy a step behind , the house drew back from another scream  | " Smoke ! Smoke ! It 's them ! Help ! They 've set the house on fire ! Help ! " Missy dodged past John as they reached the hall on the second floor . She almost upset a lamp that stood on a table against the wall , burning with a low wick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she called , and the agitated flutter of her skirts , disturbing the air , caused the flame in the lamp to tremble in its clear glass chimney . John saw that the door of his mother 's bedroom was open and that a frightened face was peering out  --  Septima 's , one of the house girls who was sleeping on a cot in his mother 's bedroom now that she was ill . When he reached the door Missy was already bending over their mother and taking her into her arms . " It 's all right , Mama , " Missy was saying . " We 're here . It 's all right , " and John was compelled to turn away . It hurt too much to see . Corwin Bottomley , holding a candle , stood in his bare feet and nightshirt in the doorway of his bedroom across the hall . The light from the candle fell mostly on the lower part of his face , leaving the rest in partial shadow . It deepened the wrinkles that ran from each side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the wide fleshy base of his nose seem larger than it was . He sniffed the air suspiciously . " I do n't smell any smoke , " he said . " Do you ? " " No , Father , " John replied . " There 's no smoke . You know that . " Corwin Bottomley raised the candle higher and began to sniff again . He hunched his head forward and turned it first one way and then the other . He said , " No , I reckon not . But still we 'd better look . I 'll go downstairs . You look around here and up on the third floor . It wo n't hurt to make sure . " John 's spirits could not have been lower as he started on his rounds . There was no smoke in the house and both he and his father knew it . There was no smoke just as there had been no poison in the soup , no climber on the roof , no prowlers on the lawn , no faces by the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt to make sure . Taking the lamp from the hall table , John went into all thep169rooms on the second floor except his mother 's . There was no sign of smoke anywhere . He climbed the stairs to the third floor , and there was no sign of smoke anywhere up there either , and when he looked in on Elnora , thinking to get her to go to Missy , since Septima was one of those stupid girls who could only polish and clean , he found the old Negro woman kneeling by her bed , moaning deep in her throat and , at the same time , saying her prayers . She had been sleeping fully dressed , as was her habit when Missy stayed out late , and her skirts had slipped up across her bare , fat legs , exposing the ends of her drawers . Her snowy turban was pushed slightly to one side , permitting an escape of frizzly gray hair , and as she knelt there , moaning and praying , she seemed taken by a trance . John touched her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs you , " and then gave up . He looked down at her , and by some releaseof self saw himself looking down at her , a fat Negro woman kneeling with the ends of her drawers showing , muttering some primitivejargon he could not understand , and he remembered the stableboySimon asleep on the tackroom floor  --  giving a silver dollar to Simon had been like giving a bucket of oats to old Delilah , and Elnora might be back in the jungles under some witch doctor 's spell . The images of Elnora and the boy Simon hung side by side for an instant , and various other images joined them  --  ancient Aunt Mim at Deerskin , Rosella who would persist in going fishing instead of taking care of the sick , Dowdy the coachman , Esau the butler , William the houseboy , little stupid Septima who could only polish and clean  --  and behind these faces , the accustomed and familiar , there stretched a denser and more ambiguous convocation of other faces , hundreds , thousands , an endless multitude , still and impassive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We could not trust them more . But though we trust and do not fear them , knowing their loyalty and devotion  --  aye , their actual love  --  once more his mother had waked up screaming , and he and his father were searching the house for smoke they knew was not there . Leaving Elnora , he joined his father downstairs in the double parlor they called the drawing room . And as if to see what he was unablep170to smell , Corwin had lighted the candles in the sconces . The soft light fell on the piano in the corner , the harp nearby , the portrait of John 's grandmother Nesbitt above the mantel , the sofas and tables and chairs , the brocades at the windows , the thick carpet with its design of repeated sheaves of rice , and the heavy , sagging figure of Corwin Bottomley in his rumpled nightshirt and bare feet . John rarely saw him so . He looked tired and vulnerable . " I could n't find anything , " Corwin grumbled . " Did you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't anything to find . You know that , " and what riveted his attention , causing him to wonder did he see correctly , was that his father was holding the silver cane that General Lafayette had presented the Light Infantry after his visit to Pompey 's Head in 1825 . It was known as the Lafayette Cane , and as grand marshal of the Light Infantry Ball , it was Corwin 's right to have it in his possession , the cane being handed down from one grand marshal to the other . John looked to make sure it was the cane , hardly trusting his eyes , and then glanced across the room at the narrow case in which the cane was kept . The case rested on a small stand that stood between the piano and the harp , and in it was a red velvet cushion worked with silver thread , the nap of the velvet bearing the imprint of the canc . John felt he would remember this scene always , the handsome room and the unhandsome man in his bare feet and nightshirt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at it ( Cameron gone , his mother ill , Missy 's evening ruined , he with a wounded arm , war likely to break out at any moment , and the Lafayette Cane the most important thing in the house to be saved ! ) , he also knew that his laughter would never be harsh or cruel . " You 'd best get back to bed , Father , " he said . " It 's cold down here . " Corwin glanced about aimlessly . " You have a good trip ? " he asked . " Yes , Father , pretty good . " " I did n't hear you come in . What time was it ? " " Almost midnight . " " The Serena break down again ? "  | " Yes sir , it did . " " The trouble is those boilers of hers . They 're damn near rusted out . I remember when the Serena was new . That was before you were born . How 's your arm ? " " Much better . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sir , not quite . " " But you can move your fingers , ca n't you ? " " Yes sir , there 's never been any trouble with my fingers . " Corwin looked at the cane absent-mindedly and polished it on the sleeve of his nightshirt . " I saw Ules Monckton today . " " Did you ? " " He was out drilling some of the men . He takes his job like he was Napoleon himself . My notion is that those fellows are going to regret electing him colonel before it 's over . Would you mind letting me onto something ? " " Of course not , Father . " " Why did n't you shoot him ? " " I could n't have , sir . It just was n't in me . " Corwin nodded slowly . " That 's what I figured . And what you did was the right thing . It must be hard to live with , having a man 's blood on your hands . But he could have killed you . It seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I am --  " " I know , Father . Thank you . " " What 's there to thank me for I 'd like to ask ? The Serena have a big crowd ? " " No sir . Not more than four or five passengers in all . " " Anybody we know ? " " Only Mr. Waites 's overseer . " " Oh , that fellow . " Corwin went to the stand and put the cane in its case . " He 's going back up North . He comes from up there somewhere . His leaving will go hard with Waites , I reckon , but maybe it 's a good thing . If we 're in for trouble with the Yankees , well , Ip172dunno --  " He closed the top of the case and shrugged off the rest of his thought . " Everything in good shape at Deerskin ? " " Yes sir , more or less . " " Plowing all done ? " " Just about . " " Wilson keeping on his toes ? " " Yes sir , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case to make certain it was secure . " You go to bed , Father , " John said . " You 'll take cold . " " Yes , I reckon I 'd better . I 'll leave you to blow out the candles . " Corwin took a step toward the door and then turned around . " Be sure you snuff the wicks out good . We do n't want your mother imaginingshe smells anything else . " Ile half shook his head and let his shoulders go slack . " Let 's hope she 'll be all right in the morning . It 's too bad she has these spells . "  |p173Perha|ps  because of his late prowling , or perhaps because he had gone to a turkey shoot several days before and stood for hours in a misty rain , Corwin Bottomley awoke next morning with a cold . When I ) r . Carpenter came to call on Mrs. Bottomley , for whom he prescribed a double dose of laudanum every six hours , he told Corwin to get back to bed , saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corwin grumbled but did as he was told . He did n't feel too well anyway . After a late breakfast John went upstairs to his father 's room . There was an unaccustomed silence in the house , as though it were still recoilingfrom the experience of the night before . Even the rays of sunlight slanting through the windows seemed wary and cautious . John mounted the stairs to the second floor as quietly as possible , not wanting to disturb his mother , who was in a drugged sleep induced by the laudanum , and rapped on his father 's door . " Come in ! Come in ! " Corwin said , and John was not surprised to find him restless and irritable . Corwin lay propped against a pile of pillows , working over a daybook . A stack of ledgers stood on the bed table , and a scatter of bills , letters , and other papers were strewn across the quilt . " I 'm laid up , dammit ! " he complained . " Carpenter says I may be getting pleurisy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time to be sick ! I had a meeting at Thrall &; Lockhart this morning about that flour mill and wharf that 's up for sale , and I was going upriver tomorrow . Here 's a letter from Belden , the new man at Cornwall . He says some of those fields were plowed too deep last year , so that they'rep174already full of alum spots , which means he might just as well not have planted for all the rice he 'll get , and he tells me that some of those ditches and sluice gates have n't been looked after in two or three years . That 's no way to do with land ! If you want it to look after you , you have to look after it . That 's the only way . Dammit , if somebody had been running Cornwall --  " But that brought him too close to Cameron : let him continue and he would have to mention Cameron 's name . Picking up another letter , he said , " And that ai n't the worst of it ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Coxey . He says more than a third of the gang is down with some kind of sickness or other , that he lost a boy from lockjaw , and that he 's most run out of Pittman 's . And on top of all that , he tells me the hogs are dying off . Dammit , no plantation man ought to let himself run out of Pittman 's , and it 's part of his business to tell a sickness when he sees it . He says it 's not the fever , but if it 's not the fever what is it ? And if the hogs are dying , why do n't he move them to a different piece of land and burn over the piece they 're now on ? There 's that whole old cane field he could use . It would be easier for me to go up there and straighten things out than all this writing back and forth . Hand me that toddy , will you ? How much did you get for the last rice you sold ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " Corwin gulped down the rest of the toddy and put the glass on the bed table , atop the pile of ledgers . He reached under the pillows for a handkerchief and blew his nose . " You sold too cheap , that 's why . You should have told Lockhart to hold it back till later , even if you had to pay storage on it . That 's what I 'm doing . Three-four months from now number-one rice will be up to twenty-two dollars , maybe even more . Where 's the letter from that Stevens fellow in New York ? He 's the one in the bank up there , the one with the Georgia wife . He writes that , because of all the war talk , commodity prices are bound to go up , rice and cotton especially . You hear about Stanhope ? It 's more of the cotton fever , but maybe he made a good move . Stevens says cotton is bound to go to fifteen cents a pound or more . It 's those cotton fellows who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myp175word . According to Stevens , all the big people up North are on our side . They do n't relish that Illinois fellow any more than we do . That letter of his must be here somewhere . Never mind . It do n't matter . 1lere 's one that came for you . It got mixed in with my mail . " John recognized the handwriting on the envelope instantly . The slanting characters and heavy downward strokes could only belong to Professor Adam Sedgewick . He had not had a letter from Professor Sedgewick in over seven years , but the handwriting was unmistakable . So now you people have had your way ! You are going to form a new government in Montgomery , I hear . Your Mr. John Calhoun must be grinning down from on high . But I wonder ! I should not like to believe that his voyage to the Hereafter left him as shortsighted as he was during his stay on earth . Surely he must now see that his cause is lost . Grinning , did I say. ? Or does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I too am acquainted with what is being said in your newspapers , and with the prevailing Southern belief that cotton starvation will soon bring the North to heel . Nonsense ! And have you considered that there are starvation more dangerous than an industrial need for cotton ? The question is not how will the North survive without cotton but how will the South survive without the manifold requirements of the modern state ? Your whole population constitutes no more than nine millions , of which three millions are slaves . The population of the North is twenty millions . Where are your army and navy , your machine shops and manufactories ? How can you supply the armies needed for war on a large scale ? Look at your map . See what a country of scattered agriculturalcommunities you are . You will be cut off by the blockade , and there can be but one issue . The South must lose . But do not think it gives me pleasure to say so . The tragedy we face is that we must all lose , North as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find joy in the coming conflict . I can not . You will have surmised from the address in the heading that I have retired from Princeton . This Massachusetts village is where I was born.  |p176I  have been putting some of my papers in order and happened to come across a copy of the address you made before the Whig Society in ' 49 . It was then your position , you may recall , that the South would rid itself of slavery by gradual emancipation , and I fear I may have offended you by some of the things I said in disagreement . At my age one begins to regret such intemperateness . It is the opinion of my wife and two sisters , however , that remorse over past errors does not improve my present conduct . I would like to hear from you again . I enjoyed the correspondence begun after your graduation and have often regretted its having lapsed . I am now in my seventy-seventh year . Though somewhat infirmin my lower limbs , I enjoy reasonably good health . It is hard for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in the light of the old Revolution , and now my last years must be spent in the shadow of this new one . No truer thing was ever said than Heraclitus'sadvta 66 , o ' v tfvEL , but I do not find it hard to wish it were otherwise . Can you still read Greek ? I doubt it . What did you learn from me , Bottomley ? Anything ? The last few lines of the letter were so like Professor Sedgewick that John wanted to smile . At the same time , however , he felt resentful over what had been said about the South 's inevitable defeat . It was one thing to have such forebodings of one 's own and quite another to have them hurled down like lightning bolts from somewhere up in Massachusetts . And all that marshaling of comparisons . It made one think of those itinerant wrestlers who appeared at county fairs , flexing their muscles and offering to take on all corners . Except , of course , that Professor Sedgewick had n't meant it that way ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Sedgewick 's wife and sisters were right . He could n't imagine that old man as being anything but tart , irascible , and sharp of tongue . " What 's so entertaining ? " Corwin Bottomley asked , looking up from some bills he was checking . " Or is it a secret ? " " No sir , it 's no secret . It 's this letter from one of my old professors at Princeton . He wants to know can I still read Greek . "  | " Can you ? " " No sir , I 'm afraid not . I never could very well . But I can read the quotation he sent . It 's from Heraclitus : All is flux , nothing is stationary . ' " " So that 's where that comes from , eh ? I always thought it was one of the Romans who said that  --  what 's that fellow 's name ? Plautus ? " Corwin reached for his handkerchief and blew his nose again . " Dammit , I 'm most stopped up as a crawfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning ? If so , I wish you would stop in at Thrall &; Lockhart and tell them I 'm laid up and for Toni Thrall to come here . I 'm supposed to tell him what I want to do about that flour mill and wharf that 's up for sale . ' They want $18,9oo . It seems around three thousand dollars too high to me . " Corwin sniffed hard , trying to clear his nose , and then went on . " What I 'm thinking is this  --  if we bought a couple of lighters and had a wharf to tie them to , we could save the money we now spend on lightering and wharf fees . All that money could be put into land . They tell me that the Fitzpatricks are considering selling that Oak Grove property on Little Pigeon Creek , and I 'd like to have it . But $18,9oo is too high . If they 'll knock off three thousand dollars , I 'm ready to buy it . It 's only the wharf I 'm after , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? " It was a new experience for John to be asked by his father what he thought . He started to reply , " I do n't know , F'ather . That 's for you to decide , " but since something more emphatic would be expected and since he did not want to appear disinterested , he said , " Offhand it sounds like a good idea . Lightering gets more and more expensive , and it would be wonderfully convenient to own a wharf , " but what he really thought was that while all is flux and nothing is stationary his father would give it a more practical turn  --  what a man had to do was to take the flux at high tide ; he had to look to the future ; there was no sense in paying lightering charges if you could find a way out of it , and if you had a chance to buy more land the thing to do was to buy , even on the eve of war . Land was land , rice was rice , and maybep178there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing is stationary only up to a point . A nian had to keep his head . " You did n't say if you were going downtown , " Corwin said . " I can send William if you 're not . " " I 'll deliver the message . I have to see Mr. Lockhart about ordering some stores , and I thought I 'd get a haircut . Even Mother got after me about it this morning . " " You need one , all right , " Corwin said , and whether or not some slight change of expression crossed his face , John found it impossible to say . " What 's that joke I heard at the club ? Either get yourself a haircut or hire out as Samson . I thought it was pretty good . " Corwin picked up another batch of bills and began going through them . " You need salt pork at Deerskin ? " " Yes sir . Some . " " Buy yourself more than some . Tell Lockhart to lay you in a year 's supply . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something 's got into the hogs all over . Salt pork 's cheap right now , but it wo n't be for long . You can save yourself a nice piece of money by buying ahead . " " Thank you for the advice , Father . Sometimes you make me wonder if Tupichichi could have been a Mohawk . " " A what ? " " A Yankee Indian . " " I do n't know what the hell you 're talking about . Tupichichi was a Creek . You know that . " " Yes , Father . I was just trying to make a poor joke . Can I do anything else for you downtown ? " " Not that I can think of . You see the paper yet ? " " No sir . Esau said you had it . What 's the news ? " " There 's too much news . A man would have to spend all his time keeping up . It looks like the convention in Montgomery will be gettingunder way most any day now . The way I hear it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If Virginia was in , we 'd have a better chance . " " How so ? "  | " We could make common cause . Our state and Virginia could stand together . This way , those cotton fellows will be in the saddle . By all rights one of our men ought to be President  --  who took the lead in this thing ? I 'd like to ask  --  but without Virginia we wo n't have enough support . I 'm not looking forward to what 's going to happen . I know those cotton fellows from the time I was governor , and what 's wrong with them , the big thing , is that they 've come up too fast . All that cotton money has given them the notion that they 're bigger than they are . " " Politically , you mean ? " " Not only politically but especially politically . You take the way it 's been in Washington . When did we last have a man in one of the big cabinet jobs ? Not since Tyler ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way it 's going to be in Montgomery . Let the cotton crowd have their way , and we 'll be left out in the cold . " Corwin stopped long enough to blow his nose and then went on . " By all rights one of our men should be President , as I 've said , but there 's no chance of that . The way I hear it , that Mississippi fellow is going to have it offered him on a silver platter . He 's in hand and glove with the cotton crowd and has been for years . So it will go , right on down the line . The cotton crowd will look after their own . Where we 'll come in , I do n't know . It all depends on Manning and what he can do for Stanhope . " " The Senator ? " Corwin nodded . " Do n't sound so surprised . You know what he 's after as well as I do . And we ca n't be left out of it entirely ! We 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way down . We have to have some consideration . What 's on your mind ? " Too many things were on John 's mind for him to reply . He was thinking not so much of Senator Stanhope as of Lydia . It would please her to be the wife of an important personage in the Confederacy . Gunpowder Street and Huntington Hall would be left that much farther behind . " Fix me another toddy , will you ? " Corwin said . " You 'll find the whisky and the sugar in the cabinet . Do n't sweeten it too much . "  |p180John  went to the cabinet , opened it , and began mixing a toddy . " What 's the Senator in line for ? " he asked . " That all depends . Manning has more influence than most people realize . He wants to be governor someday , as most likely he will , but , more than that , he 's been attending these Agricultural Society conventions all over the South . That in itself do n't mean much , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cotton crowd , it does . Manning has a long head on his shoulders . If we form a new government down here and get our own country going  --  do n't you see ? What Manning is thinking about is ten or fifteen years from now . You do n't think he aims to stop at being governor , do you ? You look surprised . " " I am , " John said , handing his father the toddy . " Here we are with the new government not even formed yet , and perhaps a war in the offing , and you tell me that Mr. Manning is looking forward to the day when he will be running for high national office . Or high Southern office . How can I not be surprised ? " " Politics ai n't like rice , " Corwin observed . " What you plant today , you do n't figure on reaping tomorrow . A man in politics has to take the long view . It 's no use otherwise . Anyway , Manning 's having worked along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Virginia was in and backing us up , Manning might be able to get him something big  --  nothing as big as the presidency , or even the vice-presidency , but maybe the Navy or the Treasury . " " Has the Senator ability enough for that ? " Convin looked at John keenly . " What is said in this room stays in this room , " he said . " Let there be no mistake , " and from the tone of his voice , as well as the look on his face , John understood his father had decided he had finally come of age . It was another tribute to his wounded arm . He had been frightened beyond all belief , and at one point so taken by panic that he wanted to turn and run , but by letting himself get shot at and , even more , by stopping a bullet , he had passed the test . Corwin looked at John an instant longer . He said , " The answer to what you just asked is no . It was said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as good as knew before you asked , did n't you ? " He paused , snuffling , and then went on . " Stanhope 's a gentleman , and he could n't be a better neighbor , but the plain truth of the matter is that he 's mostly  --  what do you call it ?  --  facade . " He looked away from John , reflecting . " Maybe , to explain what I mean , I have to go back to your great-grandfather , the first Corwin , and the men of that time . They had something to do and they did it . And they looked after their land . That was the big thing . They were planters . A man like Stanhope , he 's a gentleman planter . It 's being a gentleman that comes first . You see the difference ? " John need look only at his father to have the difference drawn . He said , " Yes sir . I see , " and Corwin finished his toddy . " You take the run of the men at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice fellows , and they 're not all lacking in brains , but something 's run down . They do n't give you much confidence . They 're fine for a spurt , but they make you wonder about the long haul . And except for five or six , there 's not one of them who can call himself his own man . They 're owned by their factors . Every penny they take in is pledged in advance . " And that 's another thing about Stanhope . A man ca n't make a move around here without the whole town 's knowing it , and what they say is that he 's getting in over his head . That little schoolteacher wife of his has been something of a luxury , and that Arbell girl is n't exactly what you 'd call an economy , either . But that 's neither here nor there . Where were we ? I seem to have run off the track . " " I asked you if the Senator had ability enough for one of those big jobs you mentioned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to back up a little . There 's more than one way of looking at it . How good is that Mississippi fellow ? Ilow much ability does he have ? Enough to be President ? Some say yes and some say no , and the way I hear it the noes are in the majority . So what you have to do is not measure Stanhope against the big men of the past , but against the men they are talking about for the new government . By that scale he does n't show up too bad . He wo n't get the Navy or the Treasury  --  there 's no chance of that  --  but he mayp182end up with something a little further down the line . They ca n't leave us out entirely . " Out in the hall a clock struck ten . It was a slow strike , solemn and portentous . John said , " If I 'm to get to Thrall &; Lockhart before everybodystarts going home to dinner , I 'd best be on my way . I 'm to tell Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there anything else ? " Corwin glanced at a bill , studying it for a moment . He looked up and said , " Yes , there is . This thing we 're in , this likelihood of trouble with the North  --  have you made up your mind what you 're going to do ? " It was such a simple question , and had been such a long time coming . And that it had been asked , John understood , was also due to his wounded arm . Man to man he and his father could now discuss such things . He shook his head as he spoke . " No , Father , I have n't . It 's something I 'm trying to decide . " " You could get a commission . You know that , do n't you ? " " No sir , I was n't quite that certain . " " Do n't be a damn fool ! All you have to do is ask ! " " Well , perhaps I will . Right now , though --  " And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obligation to find his brother . A letter that could be either M or W , and a bundle of workingman 's clothes . It was n't much to go on . " What 's the matter ? " Corwin said . " Is it because you want to raise a company of your own ? If that 's it --  " " No , Father . I have no ambitions to have my own company . And a commission is n't especially important , either . I 'd just as soon go into the Light Infantry as a private . " " Under Monckton ! " " Yes , Father . " Corwin Bottomley began to look outraged . " Do n't be a damn fool again ! You know who was second-in-command when the Light Infantryfought at Little Pigeon Marsh after General Carvell was killed ? Your great-grandfather Corwin . You know who led the Light Infantryp183when it went to Mexico ? Your grandfather Nesbitt on your mother 's side . And now you tell me you 'd as soon be a private ! " What Corwin did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not Ules Monckton , should be at the head of the Light Infantry  --  its command , like the Lafayette Cane , belonged in the family . " I ca n't make heads or tails of you , " Corwin said . " I 've been trying to , but I ca n't . " " Perhaps it 's because I 've taken one of your lessons too much to heart . " Corwin shot him a suspicious look . " What do you mean by that ? " " Nothing alarming , I hope . I 'm a planter , Father . Left to myself , I could go on being a planter for the rest of my days . I do n't like what 's happening . I do n't believe this war will be the short , swift affair that some people are predicting . And the longer it lasts , the more the odds will be against us . " It could have been Professor Sedgewick 's letter that was prompting him to say these things , but John did n't think so . Hold back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must come out . Ile was glad to be able to unburden himself at last . " I love the South , " he said . " I 'm proud of belonging here and of being who I am . That 's why , if war comes , I could n't stay behind . I would have to stand by my state . It would be my way of saying who I am . But that 's all it would be . I ca n't pretend otherwise . If we are fighting to save slavery , I do n't believe in slavery , and if we are fighting for the right to extend slavery wherever we please , even to Mexico and Central America , as Ules Monckton says , I believe in that even less . But most of all I do n't believe in this war . I 'm sorry to disappoint you , Father . I know this is n't what you wanted to hear . " Corwin looked at him , saying nothing , and John wished that he could have done less damage  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned out the way a man had hoped . A man could lie in bed with a stopped-up nose and see the crumbling of all his hopes.  | " If you 're going to fetch Tom Thrall for me , " Corwin said , " you do n't have much time . I want to sec him before dinner and I 've wasted enough of the morning as it is . Now you get . I 've got work to do . "  |p185River  Street , where the offices of Thrall &; Lockhart were located , was the financial and commercial center of Pompey 's Head . Poorly lit and deserted at night , and too near the Irish Channel and a mean side street of sailors ' bars and rooming houses to invite the late pedestrian , it was during the daylight hours the busiest part of the city . Cobbled , and having a plank sidewalk , it ran along the river front for seven blocks . The offices of Thrall &; Lockhart were housed in a two-story brick building . Mr. Henry Lockhart , the senior member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second floor , overlooking the wharves . He and John Bottomley had just concluded their business . Opening the bottom drawer of his desk , Mr. Lockhart brought out a bottle of whisky and two tumblers . All his movements were massive . Ile was six feet four inches tall and weighed two hundred and eighty pounds . He poured a drink for himself and one for John . " Health and prosperity , " he said . " The Governor is n't bad sick , is he ? " " No sir , Mr. Lockhart , " John replied . " At least I do n't think he is . He seems only to have a heavy cold . " " You get him to take care of himself . A cold can lead to anything . You 've heard about the Light Infantry , I suppose ? " " What is there to hear ? I 've been upriver for a few days , as I ex-plained . " Mr. Lockhart looked across the desk at John , as if savoring what he was about to impart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning , " and waited long enough for it to sink in . " It was a few hours after that dance given by the Palmetto Rifles . The whole thing was kept a secret . I only heard about it when I came to work . My boy Seiph did n't let on a thing . He came home for a few minutes after the dance , to get some gear he needed , and then left without anybody 's knowing it . He tells me he saw your sister at the dance . " One thing you had to say about Pompey 's Head , John thought  --  it wasted no time keeping up with who had been where . He wondered if Mr. Lockhart had heard about Missy 's devastating eyes . " Yes sir , Mr. Lockhart , " he said . " My sister was at the dance . But tell me more about the Light Infantry . What happened ? " Mr. Lockhart 's desk was strewn with samples of rice and cotton . He noticed a piece of lint clinging to the sleeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to be sure exactly what happened , " he said . " Nobody seems to know . My understanding is that the Light Infantry had a meeting three nights ago . The way it 's being told around town is that Ules Monckton made a speech and that it was all decided then . " " What was ? " Mr. Lockhart dramatically lifted his bushy eyebrows . " To march to the mouth of the river and make camp near the forts . The Light Infantryis already there . Except , if the truth be told , it did n't exactly march . They went down the river on the Serena . " " Last night ? " Mr. Lockhart nodded . " Or early this morning , whichever way you want to put it . Did n't you say you came back on the Serena ? That must have been an hour or so before the Light Infantry began going aboard . Captain Bostwick was in on it too . " " So I 'm beginning to see . " " The Light Infantry even took those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " the ones they use in the Fourth of July parade . That Monckton fellow does n't let any grass grow under his feet , does he ? " As a member of the old guard , Mr. Lockhart could not altogetherp187approve of Ules Monckton  --  Ules had come too fast out of nowhere and showed too little respect for the proprieties . But still there was a note of admiration in Mr. Lockhart 's voice . One would n't think of inviting Ules Monckton to dinner , and there was something in the way he looked at you that did n't sit too well , but at the same time it was a real smart move for him to get hold of the Serena  --  you might not like him , but you had to admit he had enterprise . Mr. Lockhart reached across his desk and picked up a sample of cotton . He pulled it apart and held it out to John . " You want to see something pretty ? " he said . " It 's from Mr. Charles Montague 's crop on Mungo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in all my life . Everything must have gone just right on Mungo this year . Long staple always has to sell for twice as much as short to pay for itself  --  you have to figure on extra costs adding around ten cents a pound  --  but cotton like this will bring twenty-seven cents anywhere . And if we start holding back our cotton , just to teach the North where to head in , there 's no telling how high the price will go . I do n't mean to offend your Ioyalties , John , but it looks as though rice is going to have to take a back seat . The big money is in cotton these days . " Letting the sample fall from his fingers , he said , " I see by today 's paperthat the proceedings in Montgomery are about to start , " and went on to repeat Corwin Bottomley 's grievance that the constitutional convention would be controlled largely by men from the cotton states . " What they ought to call this new government is the Cotton Confederacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't they hold that convention here ? Or in Charleston ? Why did they pick Montgomery ? Fifty years ago there was no Montgomery . There was no Alabama either , for that matter , or any Mississippi , Louisiana , Florida , or Texas . Not as states , that is . But if you listen to the cotton crowd , you 'd think they 're the ones who provided the statesmanship from the very beginning , not us and Virginia . I do n't like that gang . " Nodding at the proper intervals and putting in a few words when occasion demanded , John permitted his attention to wander . It could be argued that more important than what was happening in Mont/gomery was what had happened here in Pompey 's Head . For months Gup Monckton and the News had been clamoring for the capture of the two forts at the mouth of the Cassava River , and now the Light Infantry was camped somewhere near them . If Ules Monckton should move against the forts or , rather , against Fort Signal , since Lookout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owe it to our state to put one of our men somewhere near the top , " Mr. Lockhart said . " That 's what the Governor said at the club the other night , and I agree with him . If you read between the lines in the News it 's easy to see that Gup Monckton thinks he ought to be the one , which means that Ules thinks so too , but who 's going to go along with that ? Have you heard about these notions of Gup 's ? " " A little . I did n't pay much attention . " " No sane man would , " Mr. Lockhart asserted . " But did you see his editorial this morning ? Fresh , aggressive leadership is what will be needed in the new government , he said , and he could n't have more pointed a finger at himself than if he 'd printed his own picture and then under it , in big black letters , HERE IT IS . But whatever our other worries , we do n't have to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking of the forts . " I suppose so . " " I 'm a Stanhope man myself , " Mr. Lockhart went on . " Ile did all right for us when he was in Washington , regardless of what they say , and what if he did want to get in the cabinet ? What 's wrong with that ? He would have been better than some of those fellows we 've had to take . More than any of that , though , Stanhope 's a gentleman . We 'll need a few gentlemen to balance off the cotton crowd . " " Yes sir , " John said . " The way I see it , " Mr. Lockhart continued , " Stanhope has a good chance . Better than good . I agree with the Governor there too . WingfieldManning knows what he 's doing , and they ca n't leave our state out entirely . You 've heard about the Senator 's buying that cotton plantation in Louisiana , I suppose ? " John said yes , he had , and hoped Mr. Lockhart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton again . The day was approaching noon and River Street was at its busiest . A steady procession of wheels rat/fled across the cobbles , rising above the brisker sound of many heels striking the plank sidewalk , and now and then , through the open window , one could hear the voices of the Negroes working on the wharves , hired out by their masters by the day . " Excuse me a minute , will you , John ? " Mr. Lockhart said . " I 'll get one of the clerks to figure out what your order comes to . You 'd like l o know , I suppose . " " If it is n't too much trouble . " " No trouble at all . Are you sure you want that much salt pork ? " " Yes sir , I think so . " Mr. Lockhart looked at him sharply , as if trying to discover what it was he knew about salt pork that no one else knew , and rose from his desk  --  it was only when he stood that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly rooted on salt pork . John had the feelingthat the size of his order had already raised the price to future purchasers by at least two cents a pound . " I 'll be right back , " Mr. Lockhart said . " Have a cigar . Help yourself to another drink while I 'm gone . " John lit the cigar and went to the window . Though it was the first day in February , the morning was soft as spring . From the window John had a view of the cobbled street , the wooden wharves , the ships at- their moorings , and the muddy , slow-moving waters of the Cassava River . Sixteen miles downstream were the forts . One , Lookout , was a small block relic of colonial times . It had been twice strengthened and enlarged  --  firstduring the Revolution and again during the War of 1812 . Since then , though still identified as a fort on the sailing charts pertainingto these waters , it had been slowly taken over by a dense invasionof vines , creepers , and scrub palmetto . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort , Signal , was a more formidable affair . Intended to replace Fort Lookout , it stood on a long , narrow , marshy island about a quarter mile farther downstream . The distance from it to the nearest point of the shore was several hundred yards . It could be reached , from the shoreside , only by small boat . The arm of the river separatingp190it from the shore , a salt-water creek actually , was one of the favorite haunts of the Negroes who fished for the market . They sold part of their catch to the men and officers of the fort , and also peddled the fruit and vegetables their masters allowed them to grow . Built of brick , the fort took the shape of an irregular pentagon . Its walls were six feet thick . There were emplacements for ninety guns , but only thirty were in position . The garrison also was below full strength . Though upward of two hundred men would be required to man it properly , its present complement consisted of three officers and twenty-six men . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-six men , backed up by six-foot-thick walls and thirty guns , might be expected successfully to maintain their position against all but a full-fledged expeditionary force . And whatever the Light Infantry was , it was not that . If Mr. Lockhart was correctand Ules Monckton had got the whole outfit aboard the Serena , it meant he had around one hundred men at his disposal  --  one hundredmen , eager but green , and two brass napoleons that had n't been fired in years . Were it not so serious it might be entertaining  --  all this secrecy , night marching , and military play . But let just one of those young hotheads take a single pot shot at the fort and be unlucky enough to hit somebody , and the North might well consider it a cause for war . The balance was that precarious . Smoking his cigar at the window , John Bottomley could not remember ever having seen the harbor more crowded with shipping . An ocean-going steamer was berthed directly opposite , a big side-wheeler was tied up next to her , and a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river packets , another transatlantic steamer , schooners in the coastal trade , two- and three-masters that had resisted the advent of steam , and a grimy old scow stacked with fresh yellow lumber from one of the waterfront mills . Easing his arm in its sling , John turned his attention to the vessel lying closest . Her name was Falcon . Flying the British flag , she was taking on cargo . A line of low , flat carts drawn by mules and piled with cotton rattled up to her side , where a gang of stevedores workedp191at getting the bales aboard . A thin Negro woman in a purple dress crossed the street with a basket on her head , a horse-drawn omnibus lumbered past , the one that ran from Marlborough Square to the Irish Channel , and a Negro coachman guided a pair of matched chestnutsthrough the confusion . Stopping on the wharf side of the street , the omnibus discharged two of its passengers  --  a young man and woman approximately the same age , he in the rough dark trousers and blue cotton shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , slighter , wearing a severe dress of coarse gray wool and a kerchief round her head . It was she John first recognized  --  that incredibly beautiful Irish girl he had seen when he stopped to watch the work at Jennie 's Basin . Even at this distance he could see how white her skin was , and he remembered the deep dark blue of her eyes , and what he thought now was what he had thought then  --  put her into one of Missy 's party dresses and she would be the rage of the Light Infantry Ball . Something , however , was different . Her grave expression , the quiet thoughtfulness , had become a look of sorrow . Her whole lovely face was lost in grief . She and her companion began to cross the street , hurrying along a diagonal line that would bring them to the sidewalk below Mr. Lockhart 's window , and what most joined them was not so much an unmistakable family resemblance , for they could only be brother and sister , but rather some half-repressed antagonism that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she the offender and he the sullen unforgiving one . John 's gaze must have been intenser than he knew . The girl looked up as she neared the sidewalk ( it could have been the white patch of his sling that caught her attention ) , and for the briefest of instants their glances held . T'he girl looked quickly away , as much in fright as haste , and it was only then , as John met the cold hard stare of her companion , that he remembered him as the young workman whose unconcealed dislike he had had to turn away from on the morning of the duel . Mr. Lockhart strode heavily into the office . The girl and her brother were lost from view . Mr. Lockhart said :  | " What 's so fascinating out there ? You see a pretty woman ? " " No , " John wanted to reply , " a beautiful one , beautiful and sad and full of trouble , " but instead , nodding toward the Falcon , " Is she taking nothing but cotton aboard ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockhart said . " This may be one of the biggest cotton weeks in history . I would n't be surprised if we shipped out thirteen thousand bales . " John could still see the girl 's face . No one should be that unhappy . He said : " What 's the stampede ? Are people afraid of the blockade ? " Mr. Lockhart snorted . " What blockade ? All the way from the Capes to the Rio Grande ? England and France together do n't have enough ships for that , much less the North , " and he would certainly have gone into a long elaboration had not the Falcon 's whistle intervened  --  the loud blast , thrice repeated , rattled the panes of the window . " It must be getting on to noon , " Mr. Lockhart said . " That 's when she 's scheduled to sail . She was supposed to leave yesterday , but she was n't finished loading yet . We could use another hundred men on the wharves . " He looked out the window for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . " Here 's your account . It comes to a little over eight hundred dollars . All that salt pork sort of ran it up . " Mr. Lockhart 's attention was back on salt pork . If there was anything to know about salt pork , he ought to know it . Caught between his curiosity and the rule of conduct which said no gentleman must ask another gentleman a too direct question about his personal affairs , there was something volcanic about his submerged rumblings . John was not unwilling to explain that the salt pork had been his father 's idea . That , however , was prohibited . It would be implying that his father was shrewder than Mr. Lockhart . So in the end he decided that this was as good a time as any to take his leave . " What 's your hurry ? " Mr. Lockhart said . " Stay and visit . Why do n't you come to dinner ? Mrs. Lockhart was asking about you just the other day . She 'd be glad to see you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . I have some businessp193at the bank and I want to get a haircut . I 've been putting it off for weeks . " IIe need not have explained about the haircut . He stole a glance at Mr. Lockhart 's face , but all he could see was a spreading look of foviality . Mr. Lockhart 's splendid stomach strained against the buttons of his vest . His watch chain jiggled . He began to chuckle . " What 's that joke I heard at the club ? " he said . " Either get yourself a haircut or hire out as Samson . I thought it was pretty good . "  |p195By  all rights the barbershop should have been crowded since this was the busiest time of day . Instead , two of the three chairs stood empty . When John Bottomley walked in from the sun , Allbright , the mulatto proprietor , sprang to attention . Seeing him , John wished he were elsewhere . He would have preferred to have his hair cut by one of the apprentices ; now he would be obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , far more elaborately than was necessary , and John was barely able to conceal the irritation which , much as he fought against it , never failed to spring up in him whenever he laid eyes on the short , stout mulatto whose airy high-tonedness was one of the jokes of Pompey 's Head . Allbright 's shop was in a two-story , two-room frame building on Bay Street , a valuable piece of property that he owned outright . A free Negro in his late fifties , he had been emancipated when he was eighteen . Five years later , after he learned his trade from a barber in Georgetown and established himself in Pompey 's Head , four of the leading citizens of Marlborough County petitioned the state legislatureto remove the restrictions that still handicapped him as a free roan of color . He was permitted to acquire property , to travel outside the state , to own slaves , to marry without permission , and to walk the streets after curfew . He could not vote , join the militia , or serve on a jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That four of the leading citizens of Marlborough County should interest themselves in the welfare of a mulatto youth was not quite so remarkable as it sounded . Slaves were being set free all the time , andp196it nearly always followed that they were granted certain civil privileges . The most recent instance was Mr. Blackford 's jockey , Titus , and Titus 's young son , Luke . It was Mr. Blackford 's way of rewarding his jockey for having finally won the Huntington Cup on Skyrocket . Titus and Luke were given their freedom , and Skyrocket was retired . But it was nonetheless inevitable , when the notice of Allbright 's petition was advertised in the News , as required by law , that some people should surmise that one of the interested gentlemen must have been his father . Gossip , however , was no certification of parentage . If ever the identity of Allbright 's father had been known , the passing of more than a half century had long since drawn a veil . He had been a free Negro for forty years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of considerable property . He owned a small cottage at the far end of Liberty Street , a seventy-two-acre scrub farm he took in on a mortgage , and his two-story , two-room building on Bay Street . The room on the ground floor housed his shop . He made his home in the room above . Allbright was also a moneylender in a small way . Things always got around in Pompey 's Head , and everyone knew that the young men of the town often went to him for twenty-five , fifty , and even a hundred dollars . He charged them three per cent interest . The curious thing was that when he made a loan to someone more responsible , like old Mr. Van Horn who kept a saddle shop a few doors down the street , his interest doubled . The accepted explanation was that Allbright liked to identify himself with the ruling class . No man was more conscious of status . As a freeman , he looked down on slaves . Unmarried , he associated only with other free Negroes , always on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . He wore a waistcoat on weekdays , a silk hat on Sunday , and a heavy gold tiepin engraved with a set of ornate initials all the time . Tony Blackford , Tolliver Rhett , Jack Wendover , and other members of the **34;1237;TOOLONG set had all been on Allbright 's books at some time or other . Cameron Bottomley was perhaps his steadiest client . One of John 's worst quarrels with hisp197brother was caused by Cameron 's coming to him for money which , lie learned later , had gone in part to clear up a debt to Allbright . " A fine thing , " he said to Cameron , " coming to me for money to pay him off ! " Furthermore , if Cameron was so anxious to clean up his debts , why did n't he begin at home ? And another thing  --  why did he have to hang around that barbershop so much ? Did n't he realize how it looked ? " Realize , realize ! " Cameron said . " Jesus God Almighty ! Is that the only word you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't merely the money , that what he resented was Allbright 's having a claim on any member of the Bottomleyfamily , no matter how slight , and then thought better of it . " Why not ? " Cameron would ask . " What does that have to do with it ? " and some kind of answer would have to be made . " Jug ! " Cameron said . " Why should n't I visit with the other fellows in his shop ? It 's entertaining . And one reason it 's entertaining is that I do n't get any lectures ! Nobody 's always asking do I realize ! " You say you do n't trust him . All right ! That 's your business . But do n't ask me not to trust him just on your say-so ! Why should n't I ? What 's he ever done to cause me not to ? Lend me money ? Charge me three per cent ? That 's less than the bank charges , or those robbersThrall &; Lockhart ! And not once has he ever pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may not trust him , but I do ! That yellow nigger is one of the best friends I have . " " A better friend than me , I suppose , " John thought , and the thought hurt deeper than he cared to admit . But when he entered the barbershop , to be greeted by Allbright 's bow , a bow that would have been more in place in a minstrel show , he hoped what Cameron said was true . For a best friend might know why Cameron had run away and where he was . John doubted , however , that Allbright would care to confide in him . They were on too touchy terms . Unlike Cameron , he had no wish to claim the barber as a best friend , nor was he inclined to invite any intimacies . He admitted no obligation but civility , and even civility had its price . Allbright at last emerged from his bow . John tried to read his face ,  |p198without  quite knowing what he hoped to find there , but all he could see was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coarse features , his yellow skin with a big liver spot on one cheek , and his hopeful , eager look , straining like a hound on a leash  --  it was the look more than anything that set John 's teeth on edge . The barber 's change of expression indicated he sensed John 's mood . He said cautiously , " Good morning , Mr. John . It 's been a long time . You must have been hibernating yourself in the country . Could I relieve you of your hat , sir ? " and John 's irritation at last had somethingtangible on which to seize  --  hibernating yourself in the country : relieve you of your hat ! It was straight out of a minstrel show , and Allbright 's name might just as well be Pork Chops or Ham Gravy . " Good morning , Allbright , " John said . " How are you ? " The barber 's hopeful look began to strain on the leash again . He said , " I is impeccable , sir . A day like this inspirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter is done over with and gone . Leastwise I hope so . You is looking well , Mr. John . I understand that you had a misfortunate accident to your arm . You is recovering nicely , I hope . " Allbright 's voice could have been imagined to have a note of sincereconcern , and John was halfway ashamed of the impulse that made him want to drive the barber off  --  take him at face value , and what was he asking but a normal amount of human consideration ? John dropped his guard an inch or so . " It 's kind of you to ask , Allbright . My arm is coming along . " " That 's fine , sir . Yes sir , that 's mighty fine for sure . " Allbright bobbed his head up and down , looking genuinely pleased . John turned over his hat to him and sat in the hard , upright wooden chair nearest the door . The chair next to it was empty , and in the third , the last in line , a tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John nodded to him and said good morning . The man replied good morning and said was n't it a beautiful day , and from his flat accent and the way he used the word " beautiful , " John knew he was from somewhere up in the hills  --  days were pretty , not beautiful , in Pompey 's Head . Allbright spoke sharply to his unoccupied apprentice . " Boy ! Get mep199a cloth for Mr. John ! You want to keep me waiting all day like the no-account you is ! " and that was something else about him that John did not like . Allbright was hateful to his help . He kept a strap handy and often used it . " That wretchified Charles ! " John once heard him complain of an apprentice who was later discharged . " He is a Negro pure and simple , in heart and in action . He might as well not be part white at all . Three times running he 's been caught at it , cuddling a low black wench , and I refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him a good whipping , but I do n't expect it to do no good . Butter will run in suitable weather , and like-feathered birds will flock together . Oh , what a set ! " Allbright shook out the cloth that the apprentice hastened to bring him , and John braced himself against his touch . It was having to sub- , nit to Allbright 's ministrations that he could hardly bear . He held himself stiff and his emotions stiffer , looking at Allbright 's gold tiepin . It was fastened to the barber 's shirt front in the center of the V made by the lapels of his clean linen jacket . " There now ! " Allbright said cheerfully . " The usual , I suppose , Mr. John ? An all-around trim ? Yes sir . You make yourself comfortable and let old Allbright take care of you . Boy ! Bring Mr. John the morning paper ! Here you are , Mr. John . I see that cotton is selling for nine and a half cents a pound today . Mr. N. N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , and he said that in his ascertainment cotton will go up six points or more . What do you think , Mr. John ? " What Mr. John thought was that Pork Chops/Ham Gravy was never more exasperating than when he attempted the role of man of affairs . I'he tall , red-haired stranger introduced himself into the conversation . " I 'd allow that six points is lenient , " he said , addressing John by way of the mirror on the wall . " I do n't buy cotton or sell it , my business is mules , but I 'd venture to say that we 'll be seeing cotton at seventeen cents or more before the new crop comes in . My name is Morgan , sir , Robert M. Morgan , the M standing for Macdonald . I live up Greenville way . And you , sir , I take it , are an Old Pompey man . " " Yes , I am , " John said . " My name is Bottomley . " The red-haired man was impressed . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of the Governor 's family . Am I correct ? " " Yes sir , you are . The Governor is my father . " The red-haired man inclined his head in a bow . " I 'm pleased to make your acquaintance , sir . I was proud to support the Governor and I 'd be proud to support him again . We could use a man like him at the head of things right now . He made us the best governor this state ever had . Yes sir , I 've always said so , and I always will . " The attentions of the apprentice who was shaving him drove him into silence . Allbright began trimming John 's hair . Every time John felt the touch of his fingers he wanted to draw away . " I 'm here on business , " the red-haired man said , taking advantage of the first opportunity to resume the conversation . " I have a drove of mules to sell , twenty-eight in all . I 'm showing them in the square behind the courthouse . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound Kentuckys , could I , sir , guaranteed to be out of thoroughbred trotters by an imported Andalusian jack ? " " No , I think not . " " You ca n't go wrong , sir , not with these animals . Three-four months from now , once the war starts , you wo n't be able to buy them at half the price . That 's a fact . I do n't know if you 've heard the news , but Northern agents are all over the middle states , buying up every mule they can . They 're thick as the locusts of Egypt . They do n't show no sign of slacking off , either , and it wo n't be long before we 'll start feeling the pinch . " He looked at John in the mirror and shook his head dolefully . " There is just so many mules in the world , sir . That 's a fact . Let the North corner the mule market , and where will we be ? Where will cottonbe ? You can have the land and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules you ca n't make a crop . Cotton , sir , depends on mules . Even niggers is secondary . " The apprentice 's razor , squaring off his sideburns , hampered his flow of talk . But not for long . He said , " You know what I think , sir ? I think the day is coming when niggers will be cheaper than mules . That do n't seem sensible , I know , but I took in a couple of nigger auctions lately  --  only this morning I took in one : it was down thep201street a piece  --  and already the price of niggers is beginning to go soft . You were n't at that auction by any chance , were you , sir ? " " No , I was not ! " John Bottomley spoke sharply , provoked that it should even be imagined he would be seen with those down-at-the-heel loafers who went to slave auctions for free entertainment , but the mule dealer gave no sign of having noticed . Allbright 's scissors , however , rustling nervously , seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to keep up with the price of stock , " the mule dealer resumed , " and that means the price of niggers as well . Now you take that auction I was telling about . The highest bid run up was nine hundred dollars , and that was for a good , sound , number-one hand . The auctioneer had to sweat getting that much , too . He looked kind of down at the mouth about it , and I do n't blame him . Many 's the time I 've seen a hand less good than that one bring twelve hundreddollars or more . And not too far back , either . No sir , there 's no two ways about it . The price of niggers is getting cheap . " The rustle of Allbright 's scissors stopped completely . Ill at ease himself , John expected the barber to be ill at ease also . He looked for a sign of resentment or at least a show of displeasure , and what he saw was one of Allbright 's fawning , servile smiles . Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was rising from the chair , smellingof bay rum and talcum , Allbright said ingratiatingly : " Nine hundred dollars , eh ? That 's the most recessional transaction I 've heard of in a long time . Why , just three weeks ago that whole gang of Mr. Edward Montague 's went for eleven hundred a head . That means a deficiency of two hundred dollars in less than a month . What you say is correct , sir . The price of niggers is getting cheap . Yes sir , it surely is . " At that moment , could John have eliminated Allbright 's existenceby wishing him out of it , the barber would have dropped through the floor . Vowing that he would never set foot in Allbright 's shop again , that this was the end , absolutely , he noticed that the mule dealer was looking at Allbright with his mouth half open  --  hep202could not have been more confounded had one of his beasts found voice . A stranger in Pompey 's I-lead , the mule dealer naturally knew nothing of Allbright 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see , peering through those pale astonished eyes , was a yellow nigger barber who had talked out of turn . A hard look showed on his face . It said he had no use for niggers to begin with and that it would be dangerous to push him too far . But Allbright , who could not have missed the look , became more ingratiating , not less . " You have yourself a nice visit , sir , " he said , bowing the mule dealer to the door . " You come back to see us , sir , " and John sat in the chair , fuming , clamping his jaw down hard . Allbright turned from the door , his face still creased with the wrinkles of the last smile he sent after the mule dealer , and merely the sight of him was offensive . " Well , now , " Allbright said . " That Mr. Morgan was an interesting gentleman , was n't he ? I expect he 's staying down the street at the Commercial Hotel . Trade is kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the way trade is . Sometimes it blows one way and sometimes it blows the other . Fame and riches reward the bold , but a silver dollar is hard to hold . Turn your head a little the other way , will you , Mr. John ? Thank you , sir . Boy ! Ready me the lather ! Ca n't you see that I 'll be needing it soon ? You need the strap to make you step ? " John forced himself to scan the columns of the News  --  Northern manufacturers had refused to fill any more orders for Colt revolvers that came from the South ; pilots in Pensacola had been notified not to bring any more United States vessels into their harbor . It was not until he heard a voice say , " Here 's your saddle , Maussuh Allbright . Maussuh Van Horn says hit 's all fixed . Where you want hit put ? " that he looked up . A Negro boy of around twelve was wrestling with a saddle , much too big for him and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure he did , and the instant of recognitionfroze where it stood . The saddle belonged to Cameron . I-Ic had had it in his skiff the day he stopped at Deerskin . " Ca n't you see I is busy ? " Allbright said to the boy . " And ai n't youp203ever been told to wait until you is spoken to , instead of just busting in ? Put the saddle in the corner over yonder . Put it and get out of here ! " The boy did as he was told , easing the saddle to the floor . He dawdledfor a few moments , as if hoping to be rewarded with a penny or two , and then left the shop . Allbright said , " These young ones ! They ai n't got no more manners than a billy goat ! " and he might have gone on , making an oration of it , had he not seen John looking at the saddle . He started to smile , checked himself , and avoided John 's glance . John felt he stood close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wish the Bottomleys harm . There was Cameron 's saddle , and he was gone , and if he had done some bad or foolish or wicked thing and Allbright knew what it was " May I respectfully inquire into the healthfulness of your family , Mr. John ? " Allbright said . " The Governor and his lady is well , I hope . And your sister Miss Margaret ? She is well too , I trust . " Nothing could have sounded more innocent than Allbright 's expression of interest . " I do declare if I do n't see a little bit of gray around your temples , Mr. John , " he continued . " Yes sir , I do believe that the first touch of frost has arrived . Not that you have any cause to mind . No sir ! It 'll just help to distinguish your appearance that much more , " and so cheerful he appeared , so warmhearted and friendly , that John was almost led into believing it was absurd to imagine that this pompous , foolish man could be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , ai n't it , Mr. John ? " Allbright said cheerily . " Yes sir , it looks like old man winter has done gone and took hisself out the back door . I reckon you got more work to do in the country than you can shake a stick at , eh , Mr. John ? It 's no easy thing to make a turnout of rice . Most anybody can grow cotton that has a mind to , but rice , that 's something else again . All you hear around town these days is cotton , nothing but cotton , but what I say is that there ai n't but one crop for a gentleman , and that 's rice . Cotton is to try to get rich on . Rice , though , rice means something . Ai n't that the truth , Mr. John ? "  |p204John  wanted to shake him . What made his chatter especially infuriatingwas that it summoned up a distorted image of Corwin Bottomley . For he too would say that cotton was to try to get rich on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as though Corwin had been inveigled into minstrel-show dress . John said , weighing his words , " I doubt that anything means what it used to , Allbright , rice included . But tell me this . That saddle that Mr. Van Horn 's boy brought in . Have n't I seen it somewhere before ? " Allbright , soaping John 's neck from a bowl of lather , took longer than necessary to reply . " What 's that , sir ? You say something , Mr. John ? " " Yes , Allbright . I said have n't I seen that saddle before ? " " That saddle , sir ? Has you seen it somewheres before ? Well , sir , that 's something I ca n't rightly say . There 's a lot of saddles in Old Pompey . " " Yes , " John agreed , " but not many like that . Does it belong to anybodyI know ? " " Excuse me , Mr. John . " Allbright placed the bowl of lather on a shelf near the mirror . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to sit still a minute . I 'll be using the razor for a little bit , and we do n't want to have no accidents . No sir , that we do n't . There now ! That takes care of that . Thank you , sir . What was it you was saying , Mr. John ? " " I asked if that saddle belonged to anybody I know . " Allbright wiped and folded his razor . " Oh , that saddle . Yes sir , I reckon you could say it do . That old saddle belongs to me . " " To you ? " " Yes sir , that 's right . It 's a gift , you might say . A couple of times I admired that saddle when the young gentleman to who we is referringcame in to get a haircut , and he said he wanted me to have it . Was n't that handsome and generous of him ? " John said , " Yes , very , " and Allbright 's cleverness amazed him  --  no young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but mentioned Cameron 's name.  | " It 's a valuable saddle . That young gentleman must think a lot of you . Allbright 's voice changed tone . " Ah , yes sir . That young gentleman does me the honor of saying that I is one of his best friends . I 'd do anything for that young gentleman , anything at all . " John was at a loss . It would have been impossible for anyone to sound more affectionate or sincere , and the look on Allbright 's face , his thoughts turned inward for the instant , was that of a kindly , benevolentuncle . " The young gentleman who gave you the saddle , " John said . " Have you seen him lately ? " Something in his manner of speaking must have put Allbright off , an overeagerness perhaps , a too close coming to grips , or it could have been that Allbright , rehearsing his words beforehand , wanted time to think . The barber stepped back from the chair to examine his handiwork , glancing obliquely at John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its suggestion of a piece of still water , it was as though they were two swimmers , fully clothed , who were grappling with each other at the bottom of a pool . Allbright said , " What 's that , Mr. John ? What did you say , sir ? " and John came close to the end of his patience . He said , repressing his irritation , " It was merely an idle question , Allbright . What I asked was have you seen that young gentleman lately ? " and Allbright , picking up his scissors to make a few last snips , seemed more at ease . " Lately , Mr. John ? Well , sir , that all depends on what you mean by lately . Midnight for Jim is morning for Jack , and a skinny man 's door is a fat man 's crack . Lemme see now . The last time I seen that young gentleman was maybe two weeks ago . That was when he came and brung me the saddle . It could have been a day less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in general was when it was . " John tried to put things in order  --  two weeks ago , more or less , was when Cameron had disappeared . That much was in order . But if Allbrightwas telling the truth , why had Cameron gone out of his way to make him a present ? And this in the midst of his panic ? There was ap206large gap somewhere . John began to doubt that the saddle was a presentat all . A likelier explanation would seem to be that Cameron had tried to buy Allbright off with it . It was not too much to imagine that part of his fifteen hundred dollars had gone toward the same end . He said , offhand as possible : " I understand that the young gentleman we are talking about has gone away . Would you know anything about that ? " Allbright 's fleshy face creased itself into a set of earnest wrinkles . " No sir , " he said , " that I do n't . I hear that that young gentleman has gone away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can say , sir , not for sure . " " Perhaps you can tell me this , then . The day that that young gentlemancame to give you the saddle . Did he say anything about going away then ? " Allbright reached for the bay rum , and John knew beforehand that they were going off on a different tack . " Oh , sir , " Allbright said , " that young gentleman was always talking about going away . " " Always ? " " Well , sir , maybe not exactly always . But enough to make it seem like always . That young gentleman was sort of uncontented around here . " " Was he ? " " Yes sir , I do believe he was . And that 's the curious thing , once you stop to think of it . A young gentleman like that , being who he was and all . Now why should he be uncontented ? That 's what I used to ax myself time after time . " " Did you ever ask him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one palm and filled it with bay rum . " Now what would I be doing axing a young gentleman like him a question like that ? No sir , Mr. John . I never axed him anything . " " But you say he used to talk to you about wanting to go away . " " Yes sir , that he did . " " Did he ever say why ? " Having applied the bay rum , Allbright began to comb John 's hair.  | " Why , sir ? " he said . " Well , Mr. John , that 's kind of hard to say . You know these young gentlemen . Some little old thing goes wrong with them , something that do n't amount to a hill of beans , or else they just up and lose their tempers , and right away it 's off to Texas or Mexico or even South America . You know how they is . " Texas , Mexico , or South America  --  John wondered if Allbright was hinting that Cameron must be searched for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control his exasperation . Let Allbright keep up this evasiveness and the sheriff would have to be called in . Even as the threat crossed his mind , however , he knew what an empty threat it was . To call in the sheriff would be to make the whole thing public property and , worse , perhaps to bring down on their heads the very harm he hoped to avoid . But more than that , there stood himself . Ile could never hand Allbright over to the sheriff , knowing the sheriff 's methods , and Allbright must be aware of it . Pork Chops/Ham Gravy seemed to hold the advantage at every turn . " This young gentleman , " John said . " Not once did he tell you why lie wanted to leave Old Pompey . Is that it ? Not ever ? " Allbright said , " Yes sir , Mr. John . That 's right . Not ever , " and the lie was so manifest that his every muscle gave it away . He put away the comb and brush , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " That young gentleman just used to talk about going away , that 's all . He especially talked about it in the last two-three months or so . Some kind of change come over him . A big change . " John tried not to let his mounting resentment show . He could feel the same antagonism building up in him as when , having boated an eel while fishing , he had to contend with the slippery creature  --  in the end there was nothing to do but bash in its head . " You say a change came over him ? I wonder why . " Allbright did not have to wonder why . He knew why . Nothing could have been any plainer . He went through some kind of conflict with himself , seemingly pulled first one way and then the other , and John was ready to believe that he stood on the verge of telling whatever it was he knew . John waited , hoping that the shock was not going to be more than he could bear , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's that again , Mr. John ? What was it you asked ? " it was impossible to hold back his anger any longer . " I want you to stop beating around the bush , Allbright ! " he said . " What has happened to my brother ? I insist you tell me ! " and all the while he knew he was taking unfair advantage  --  he was John Bottomley , the master of Deerskin , and Allbright was a mulatto barber , and he might as well be standing over him with a whip . " I warn you , Allbright ! Either you tell me what you know or I will take measures to make you tell ! I want to know what has happened to my brother ! " Allbright 's face had paled to a sick , grayish color . " Your brother , Mr. John ? You mean Mr. Cameron ? Now surely , Mr. John --  " " I told you to stop beating around the bush , Allbright ! " " But Mr. John ! " " Where is nay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look of innocence , buttressedby what was intended to be a cajoling smile . " Could I tell you where Mr. Cameron has gone to I would , Mr. John , but that ai n't to be . I do n't know nothing about Mr. Cameron . Oh , yes sir , I heard he went away , that I did , sir , but as far as me knowing --  " John held onto his temper hard . " I 'm at the end of my patience , Allbright ! Either you tell me the truth about this or I 'll have the sheriff in here before the hour is out ! You do n't think you have any special immunity , do you ? If so , I 'll damn well teach you otherwise ! " Allbright felt the crack of the whip . A bleak look came into his eyes . " Well , sir , " he said quietly , " if you want to call in the sheriff there 's nothing I can do , no sir , that I ca n't , " and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Bottomley detested himself . " You tell the sheriff to do something and he 'll do it , " Allbright continued . " I know that , sir , and I know it will go hard with me . But there ai n't nothing I can tell the sheriff , any more than I can tell you , " and John , thoroughly unsettled , sensing that Allbright was both lying and telling the truth , knew that his outburst had cost him the game . " So you do n't know where my brother has gone ? "  | " No sir , Mr. John . " " Or why he went away ? " " No sir , Mr. John . " " Or anything at all ? " " No sir , Mr. John . " John was swept by a spasm of rage . It could have been the wooden monotony of Allbright 's replies that set it off , or it could have been his own sense of shame . " You listen to me , Allbright ! You 're a liar , the damnedest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ! " and he might have gone on , heedless of the shame he felt , had not a sudden commotion boiled up in the street . Several horsemen in uniform swept past the door of Allbright 's shop , trailing a wake of cheers in a wake of dust . A crowd began to gather on the sidewalk amid a mounting accumulation of voices , and almost immediately a bald , middle-aged man in shirt sleeves darted into the shop . " The forts are taken ! " he cried . " The Light Infantry has taken the forts ! " and then sped on to spread the news elsewhere . John Bottomley glared at Allbright , trying to find excuses for himself , saying that despite his occasional offenses he had never turned his back on the man , not once , and did he not deserve better than these evasions , these subterfuges , these lies ?  --  and then , with anger once more turning into rage , against himself , against Allbright , against the involvement that had placed him in this harsh position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he was halfway down the next block , nearing the Commercial Hotel , that he regained enough control to remember he had n't settled for the haircut . The Commercial Hotel was caught up in some special excitement . The state flag had been run out on the flagpole that jutted across the sidewalk , there was much shouting and cheering , and some young fool of a horseman , having ridden a big gray horse up the wide wooden steps of the hotel , was causing his mount to rear on the porch , pawing wildly and baring its teeth . John recognized the horseman as Tony Blackford , streaked with dust and sweat , and it fell into place that he was one of the riders who had dashed past Allbright 's shop , galloping back from the forts . Johnp210thought of returning to pay for the haircut and decided it could wait . He could not free his mind of the thought that Alibright , because of Cameron , had been placed in a position to do the Bottomleys some dangerous , vengeful harm . He strode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p211Pom|pey  's Head had always had a fondness for celebration . Corwin Bottomley once said that all a man needed to start a parade was a sick mule and a sour bass drum . Within a half hour of the arrival of the news that the Light Infantry had taken the forts , all ordinary businesscame to an end . Crowds of cheering , singing men swarmed through the downtown district , the bars and restaurants were thronged to the doors , Mayor Josephus Warren delivered three speeches from the steps of City Hall , store fronts were decorated with bunting and streamers , firecrackers were set off , guns and revolvers were fired into the air , steamboat whistles were tied down , six runaway carriages turned over , Boykin 's livery stable burned to the ground when a spark from a bonfire ignited a pile of hay , and the four young men who had ridden to town with the news were so patriotically roughed up that they were forced to take refuge in the Light Infantry Club , where thirty gallons of Light Infantry punch had been hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never so brilliant a victory : it was a combined Waterloo and Solferino , and bloodless , besides . By three o'clock the News was on the street with an extra . It said that a splendid triumph had been won , that not a life was lost , that only one man was injured , and that Ules Monckton , by this one stroke , had proved himself a commander of surpassing genius . At five o'clock a second extra appeared with a longer and more factual account of the action . John Bottomley was in the Light InfantryClub at the time . Nearly the whole membership was present , except for those who were with the colors ( " with the colors " was ap212new expression , sprung up in recent weeks ) , and the thirty gallons of Light Infantry punch were running out fast . Tony Blackford stood on the billiard table leading a songfest  --  the cloth would have to be replaced , but what , at a time like this , was a piece of felt ? The quietest place in the club was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be established , by a sort of squatter 's right , as the fief of the older members , who found it a pleasant place to doze . John brought the News into the library to read . When he entered he saw that eighty-two-year-old Mr. Montague Vincent , Clay 's father , was fast asleep near a marble bust of General Lafayette , that Thaddeus , the oldest of the Negro stewards , was standing in his usual place in one of the corners , half asleep himself , and that Mr. Robert Ransome and Mr. George Pruett , who were rather like stripling members of the library sub-club , being only in their seventies , were conversing in subdued tones on a low , worn couch before the empty hearth . They nodded respectfully to John , who ordinarily would no more have venturedinto the library than he would have clapped Mr. Vincent on the back , the old irascible terror , and John was able to detect another tribute to his wounded arm . His not being in uniform was no longer held against him and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his courage , his loyalty to the South . Having already had a firsthand account of the incident from Tony Blackford before his songfest phase , John was curious to see what Gup Monckton had made of it . " At about seven o'clock this morning Forts Signal and Lookout surrendered to the officers and men of the Pompey 's Head Light Infantry , under the leadership of Colonel Ules Monckton . Colonel Monckton , with a shrewdness that would have won the admiration of that earlier low-country hero , Francis Marion , the Swamp Fox , engineered a maneuver that history must surely record as one of the most brilliant in the annals of warfare . Not a single man was lost , and only one injured . Private Neville Monckton , a brother of the colonel , suffered a severe powder burn to his right hand and arm when a field gun exploded at the breech . " The remainder of the account , which ran to two full columns , went into a detailed explanation of the plan that Ules Monckton had pro/posed to put into effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen in all , were commandeered . Each had room for at least six men . Deserted Fort Lookout presented no problem . Fort Signal was the target . The assault was planned to begin at dawn . Twenty members of the Light Infantry shed their uniforms , put on old clothes , and blacked their hands and faces . Under the pretense of being Negro fishermen , they were to approach Fort Signal by way of its creek side , pretending they had fish , berries , and garden produce to sell . On the basis of the known routine of the fort , the News went on , as carefully studied by Colonel Monckton over a period of several months , it was expected that twelve men , in two skiffs , would contriveto be admitted into the fort . These were placed under the command of Colonel Monckton and Captain Anthony Blackford . Once inside the fortifications , this vanguard was to overcome the sentriesas quietly as possible . The other skiff-loads would instantly effect a landing , render such aid as might be necessary , and seize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which all this time would have been lying concealed ashore , would leap into the remaining skiffs , join their comrades , and take final possession of the fort . " Not a single detail was overlooked , nor anything left to chance , " Gup Monckton commented , and it was not until one came almost to the end of the account that one discovered that chance had played at least a small part in the proceedings . What happened was that twenty members of the fort 's twenty-ninemancomplement had gone ashore shortly after daybreak on a woodcuttingdetail . The commanding officer , a Major Granby , was still asleep . Whatever his dreams were , it was unlikely they were dreams of danger . Undermanned Fort Signal lay at the end of nowhere . Last month 's pay was still owing Major Granby 's men , and his stores were almost gone . The national administration appeared to have forgotten Fort Signal 's existence . Major Granby was a disgruntled , frustrated man . Possibly Ules Monckton 's plan would have succeeded even had all the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the laxness that prevailed . The counterfeit Negroes of the Lightp214Infantry were not even challenged . They simply beached their skiffs and walked into the fort . The nine men left on the premises instantly surrendered . So did the woodcutting detail . Not a shot was fired . Everythingwas conducted in the friendliest manner . Major Granby was permitted to shave and dress before his meeting with Ules Monckton . It was understood that his sensibilities would be offended did he have to hand over his sword in his underwear . The only loud noise that attended the operation was caused by the firing of one of the brass napoleons . It was Neville Monckton 's way of celebrating the victory . He fed the weapon enough powder for a piece twice its size . The gun burst at the breech , and Neville was burned on the right hand and forearm . " His is the distinction of sustaining the first injury suffered in the cause , " Gup Monckton meditated . " His wounds are the envy of every patroit and will do him honor the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smile at Gup Monckton 's fraternal enthusiasm  --  it was even touching , in a way  --  he understood that what he was reading was the unveiling of a hero . Wounds maketh the man . Neville 's languid handsomeness would go well with a sling . He could count on more successes . Additional credit would be extended . The shady patches in his background would be forgotten . Thanks to an ignorance of explosives , the youngest of the Monckton brothers had finally arrived . But Pompey 's Head could also be said to have arrived . The beam of the nation 's attention swung from the forts in Charleston Harbor to the forts at the mouth of the Cassava River . It was not until several days later , when some of the out-of-town newspapers were received , that Pompey 's Head began to understand how completely it occupied the center of the stage . The North had been served notice . Defiance had been hurled . The fame of the Light Infantry , ringing round the country , would soon ring round the world . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued a proclamation declaring a holiday , and the Newsp215published the order of events  --  the return of the Light Infantry aboard the Serena Moore at 11 A.M. ( all save a small detachment that would be left behind to hold the forts ) , followed by the presentation of a bouquet of red roses to Colonel Ules Monckton by six-year-old Miss Marybelle Wendover , and then a parade from the Bay Street wharf to City Hall by way of Bay , Magnolia , and Alwyn streets with the following units in the line of march  --  two grand marshals on horseback , the Always Ready Fire Brigade , the Marlborough County Brass Band , the six surviving members of the War of 1812 riding in open carriages , two more grand marshals , Colonel Ules Monckton and Mayor Warren in another open carriage , the officers and men of the Light Infantry , the Old Pompey Band under the direction of Major Wolfgang Weber , and , bringing up the rear , the Never Asleep Fire Brigade and its Protect Your Property Brass Band . The parade was scheduled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall at approximately 12 noon . At 12:30 P.M. , following a few remarks by Mayor Warren , there was to be an addressby Colonel Ules Monckton , after which the remainder of the day would be devoted to rest and recovery . At 10 P.M. a display of fireworks would be set off from two barges anchored midstream in the Cassava River , and at 11 P.M. , after the fireworks , there was to be a ball in honor of the Light Infantry , to which Major Granby , the vanquished commander of Fort Signal , had also been invited  --  the News , in a separate paragraph , explained that Major Granby would depart for the North by railroad the following morning and that Mayor Warren was planning to escort him to the station.  |p216John  Bottomley , having promised his sister Missy he would take her IC ) the parade , began to grumble when he learned she had invited Arabella Stanhope along . " Oh , do n't be like that , Johnny ! " Missy said . " Arbell has n't an escort . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one of the grand marshals . Arbell wo n't be any trouble . She 'll just be riding in our carriage and sitting with us , that 's all . " Cards for seats in the reviewing stand had been sent to the Bottomleysas a matter of right . John 's mother was still confined to her bed , and though Corwin Bottomley had n't fully recovered from his cold , he decided to attend the ceremonies anyway . As a former governor his presence would be expected : how would it look if he did n't appear ? Beneath the requirements of propriety , however , there ran the stronger pull of curiosity . John understood that his father 's real reason for deciding to attend the ceremonies was the same as his own  --  they both wanted to have another look at Ules Monckton . No longer was Ules a purely local figure . Extras telling of his exploit had appeared in every city North and South . A special correspondent of The Times of London telegraphed Mayor Warren , explaining that he was en route to Pompey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor 's help in arranging an interview . The Mobile Advertiserurged Ules 's appointment as commander-in-chief of the Southern miles . The New Orleans Picayune proposed him for President . The Vicksburg Daily Citizen , in an editorial that Gup Monckton saw fit to reprint on the first page of the News , warned the members of the constitutional convention meeting in Montgomery not to fail top218take the fall of Fort Signal into consideration  --  Colonel Monckton , the members were reminded , was the foremost man in the South . " And dammit , it 's true ! " Corwin Bottomley said to John , sitting in the reviewing stand before City Hall . " I ca n't stomach the fellow , and all this hoorah ai n't making it any easier for me , but you have to give credit where credit is due . He went out and did it . He showed the North where to head in . But the big thing , the way it said in the paper , is how this will affect those fellows in Montgomery . They 'll hem and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cotton crowd will be out to grab all it can , which wo n't be hard , seeing as how they 've got everything rigged their own way , but this fellow 's taking the forts is bound to make a difference . He 's given Wingfield Manning a trump card . The cotton crowd ca n't afford to ignore us now . Manninghas been put in a position to get something big for Stanhope . The odds have gone over to his side . " " But what about our friend Gup ? " John asked , seeing the editor of the News in the front row of the stand . " How will he take it ? " " Take what ? " " What you said about the Senator . Is n't Gup hoping to be made a member of the cabinet ? More than hoping ? Expecting ? Has n't he as much as come right out and said so ? " " What difference does that make ? " " I can imagine its making a lot of difference . Wo n't he feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not Senator Stanhope ? " " Well , what of it ? " What of it was easy , John thought  --  should Senator Stanhope actuallybe named to the cabinet , Gup Monckton was not likely to take it gracefully . Having cast himself as an important member of the new Confederate government ( and why not ? was he not recognized as perhaps the most brilliant spokesman of the secessionist South ? ) , and then to see the plum fall into another man 's lap , largely as the result of his own brother 's enterprise --  " It seems to me , " John said , " that Senator Stanhope is going to have an enemy on his hands . " Corwin Bottomley shrugged . " Any man who do n't want to makep219enemies had best stay away from politics . All you 're saying is that ( : up Monckton will be rubbed the wrong way . What do you want inc to do ? Take up a collection ? Do you think that if a fellow happens to run a newspaper and says that he ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wild Red Indians  --  do you think that that 's all there is to it and that Ire 's going to be obliged ? Things do n't work out that way . " " I never thought they did . " " Maybe not , but you gave that impression . The thing is , in politics you have to have friends at court . And they have to have friends in court . That 's where Wingfield Manning counts . Maybe our people are n't as strong as they used to be , but Manning knows his way around . We ai n't ready for the boneyard yet . We still have more of a say-so than maybe you think . We made up our minds a long time ago that we were n't going to be left out of the new government , and we picked Stanhope as our man . " " We ? I did n't know you had a hand in it . " " Well , now you do . " " Is Gup aware of this ? " " I would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . But what if he is ? What can he do except write something else about how the new government will need new leadership and new faces and new enterprise ? Him in the cabinet ? Do n't he a fool ! If we 're so close to the bottom of the barrel that all we can come up with is some fellow who is always hanging onto his brother 's coat-tails --  " " Not so loud , Father . He 'll hear you . " Gup Monckton was dressed to the nines . His position as editor of the News would have placed him up front in any case , and his being illes 's brother added to his prestige . He sat with an open notebook on his knee , wearing the constrained look of one who , though full of his own importance , was trying hard , unsuccessfully , not to let it appear . " Let him hear ! " Corwin said . " He looks like a wax dummy , do n't lie ? " but John noticed that his father paid Gup the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stands belongedp220to Corwin 's generation  --  gray heads , bald pates , and wrinkled cheeks predominated . None of them liked Ules Monckton and they would never forget , as long as they lived , that Cup , before Ules 's emergence as landowner and newspaper proprietor , was nothing but a bookkeeper . But there Gup was , sitting in the front row , and here they were , waiting , theoretically , to pay tribute to Ules  --  it was not hard to see them as the aging , disgruntled patricians stripped of most of their prestige and power by younger , more energetic , more ambitious men . The seats assigned to the Bottomleys were in one of the forward rows , not far from the speakers ' platform . A large crowd had gathered on both sides of the street , and Alwyn Square , opposite the stands , was filled to overflowing . The raw lumber of the stands was hung with bunting , a more elaborate display was draped across the face of City Hall , and a large state flag was wrapped like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his father and Missy , and next to Missy sat Arabella Stanhope . Arabella wore a dark green dress and a little plumed hat . The sun caught the ends of her reddishbrownhair , putting bronze highlights in it , and John was reminded of the time she was night-blooming catchfly in the pageant at Happy Chance . " What time is it ? " Corwin Bottomley asked . " Do they expect us to wear out our behinds all afternoon ? " " It 's just a little past twelve , Father . How do you feel ? " " I feel fine . " " Are you sure ? " " Yes , I 'm sure ! Stop pestering me , dammit ! I 'm a long way from having to spend the rest of my life in bed . " " Nobody said anything about that . " " And I said I was feeling fine ! Ai n't that enough for you ? I see that Stanhope 's wife is sitting with Mrs. Mayor Warren . One thing you have to say for her  --  if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be her fault . " John had noticed Lydia the moment he arrived  --  he was deliberately not looking in her direction . She sat in a place of honor with Mayor Warren 's short , dumpy wife and must have had her seamstress runp221Hp a new gown for the occasion , white , with long full sleeves , the bodice embroidered with the sheaf of rice that was part of the state emblem , worked into a circle of small blue stars . In place of a bonnet she wore a rosette of gray , blue , and scarlet ribbon . Missy called it a secession cockade . Lydia 's manner toward Mrs. Mayor Warren , John thought , was too cordial and affectionate . It was bound to be chalked up against her as another black mark by the ladies of the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society . Mrs. Mayor Warren was overdressed and underbred . She talked too loud . She wore too many rings . She was one of the commonest women in town . The ladies of the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society , however , were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Light Infantry Club , where all the important decisions were made , hers were the invitations most highly prized . Where else in Pompey 's I lead could one meet a delicious little French actress , or that delightfulcontralto who sang at the Marlborough Theatre a few weeks back , and who else would have thought of hiring a band of traveling acrobats , accompanied by an ape , a troupe of trained dogs , and a Chinese magician , to perform in her garden after dark , with torches on the lawn and flambeaux in the trees ? Outnumbered and outflanked , Lydia had beaten the ladies of the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society at their own game . When visitingdignitaries stopped off at Pompey 's Head  --  old friends of Senator Stanhope from Washington ; a famous English author ; a Danish merchant prince  --  it was Lydia who first entertained them . Already , with the help of Mrs. Warren , she had snared the correspondent of The Times of London . She would be giving a little supper for him tomorrow night . And if by some chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Stanhope was eminently fitted for high office in the new Confederate government  --  well then , could she be blamed ? A sound of music rose beyond the square , coming from the direction of the river and riding above a more muffled sound of cheers . Looking away from Lydia , John saw Arabella Stanhope watching himp222intently . Her face wore a bemused , speculative expression , and her eyes , more gray today than green , were wide and still . John 's thoughts were so close to the surface that he felt he must be as transparent as glass . Arabella 's look persisted , meeting his directly , and then , with the barest flicker of a smile acknowledging the exchange  --  not mocking , not scornful , merely a smile  --  she turned her attention elsewhere . " Damnation ! " Corwin Bottomley said . " There 's no excuse for this ! Why ca n't these things ever begin on time ? " " I do n't think we 'll have to wait much longer , Father . Ca n't you hear the music ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imply I 'm getting deaf ! " John knew the signs . Boredom was making his father cross , and deeper than boredom was the worry they felt about Cameron  --  though his father had elected not to discuss Cameron 's disappearance , thereby implying that he had washed his hands of him , it could not be imagined he was immune from the strain . John said withoutthinking , " You 're not getting tired , are you , Father ? " and Corwin let him have it full blast . " I told you to stop pestering me , goddammit ! Ca n't you find anything better to do ? Flirt with the girls , look at the crowd , say your prayers ! But stop clucking over me ! " " I 'm not clucking , Father . " " Well , that 's what it sounds like ! " " I did n't mean to annoy you . " " Now who said anything about being annoyed ! Why are you so touchy ? " Silence , at a time like this , was the safest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the population of Pompey 's Head had collected in the neighborhood of City Hall . Whole families had turned out , and many of the country people , picnicking under the trees in the square , were making a day of it in town . " I do n't see how you can say a thing like that , " John heard Missy say to Arabella Stanhope . " I suppose he can be called handsome , if you like his kind of looks , but I doubt that he 's sincere . " " Fiddle ! " Arabella said . " That 's Constance Pettibone speaking , not you ! Any man she makes eyes at and who does n't swoon atp223her feet , overcome , why then he 's not sincere ! She set her cap for him from the very beginning . Did n't you see her the night of the ball ? " " Well , if you mean --  " " If I mean ! Do n't play Little Miss Innocent with me ! You know what I mean . Constance Pettibone all but threw herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I would too had I been royally snubbed as that . " " The way you talk , Arbell ! It almost sounds as if you were in love with him . " " Dear , dear , does it now ? Constance Pettibone 's tongue clacks away , hinged in the middle and loose at both ends , the insincerest tongue in town , and if one finds her tiresome and says so , then naturally one has to be in love . " John felt unaccountably dejected  --  did they ever think of anything else , those two ? They had been prattling of love almost from the time they had been able to prattle at all . He stole a glance at Lydia , who was leaning toward Mrs. Mayor Warren in a way that caused her face to be seen slightly from above , its most appealing angle , and what love was , was an odious , festering , degrading wound . And for what ! Corwin Bottomley said , squinting , " Ai n't that Peter McIntosh over there by the lamppost , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John looked at his father closely  --  Peter McIntosh had been in his grave for five years , as Corwin Bottomley knew , or should have known , since out of some impulse of affection or loyalty he had attendedthe old smith 's funeral . John was prompted to remind his fatherof Peter McIntosh 's demise , only to decide , as Corwin went on squinting , that it was kinder not to . He heard Arabella Stanhope say acidly , " And now , since he 's been wounded and all , she 'll probably make a worse spectacle of herself than ever , " and it dawned on him that it was Neville Monckton who was being debated . It could n't be true what Missy had implied , that Arabella was in love with him ( whatever soft , sleazy thing they meant by love ) , and yet given Neville 's looks , his uniform , and his romantic emergence as a hero -- A burst of music came from down the street , much closer , and the crowd pressed forward to get a better look . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the width of the street . John saw a horse-faced countryman who even from this distance bespoke the smell of chewing tobacco and manure ; another man , a town dweller by his dress , who had hoisted a towheaded boy to his shoulders ; a phalanx of youths in the blue work shirts and heavy brogans of the Irish Channel , and , looking fixedly toward the stands , the stolid , imperturbable figure of Allbright . Ever since the episode in Allbright 's shop , three days before , the image of the mulatto barber had been somewhere in John 's mind . He would open his eyes in the morning , aware that something was nagginghim , as might some pain or ache partially numbed by sleep , and gradually , as the disorderly landscape of night gave way to the more dependable geography of day and one by one he lifted his burdens and strapped them to his back  --  Cameron , his mother 's illness , what to do with himself if war came , his infatuation with Lydia Stanhope  --  gradually he would remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watching the barber from the stands , and unable to keep his eyes from him , John felt weighed down with misgivings . Allbright was dressed in his broadcloth best , sporting a high silk hat and a goldheadedcane . His large head seemed set lower than usual between his heavy shoulders , hunched forward in a way that was remindful of Corwin Bottomley when his attention was riveted on something , and despite the jostling of the crowd , pushing this way and that , he gave the impression of standing aside , withdrawn and superior . " Petunia ! " Missy said . " What 's holding up the parade ? It ought to be here by now ! " and it was then , when John 's spirits could not have been lower , that Allbright caught sight of him . The barber 's face lit up , the eager look came into his eyes , hopeful and straining , and he lifted his hat  --  then , unable to leave well enough alone , drawn into one of those implications of intimacy that John abhorred , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have called attention to himself more had he stood on his head . " Who 's that fellow ? " Corwin Bottomley asked . " You know him ? " and Corwin was not the only person in the stands whose curiosityp225was aroused . Had Allbright been coal-black and garbed in ragged hand-me-downs , his exaggerated gentility might have been laughable  --  as it was , light of skin and expensively dressed , he came too close to home for comfort . It could be suspected that a criticism was implied , and the criticism was disquieting . Embarrassed that Allbright had presumed to this public display , almost as equal to equal , John said to his father , seeing no way out of it , " That 's that mulattobarber , Allbright , " and though he looked searchingly at Corwin , who was squinting at Allbright with his blunt , fleshy nose crisscrossed with wrinkles , he could detect only an impassive detachment . " He sure thinks a lot of himself , do n't he ? " Corwin said . " That 's the trouble with these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They act like they own the place , " and there was hardly any difference between Corwin 's tone and that of the red-haired stranger in Allbright 's shop comparing niggers and mules . There was a nearer crash of music , and the first units of the parade came into view . The parade was headed by two grand marshals on horseback , Senator Stanhope and Mr. Endymion Waites , and next in line , stepping lively , dressed in red shirts , black trousers , and white helmets , came the Always Ready Fire Brigade . Some of its members were pulling their brand-new pumper , a shiny white-and-gold machine with the name EXCELSIOR lettered in gold on both sides , and immediatelybehind the firemen marched flutter of scarves and handkerchiefs livened the stands , and in the excitement John lost track of Allbright . The damage , however , was done . John found it hard to interest himself , after the parade , in Ules Monckton 's address . Mayor Warren , in his introduction , threatened to go on forever . When eventually he delivered up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything he had to offer . John watched him rise from his scat , step to the rail of the speakers ' platform , and wait for the cheeringto cease . His uniform was wrinkled , his boots wanted polishing ,  |p226and  either he had shaved early that morning , before the Light Infantry boarded the Serena Moore , or else it had slipped his mind . He seemed indifferent to the crowd 's acclaim , even bored , and his eyes had the dull , empty look that could be taken as an oblique reflection of his gangly stance . Eventually the crowd quieted down . Remembering the night Ules had addressed the Agricultural Society and how transformed he was once he started speaking , John waited for a similar change to occur . But not at all . Ules said he appreciated this reception by his fellow citizens , that he wished to express the thanks of the Light Infantry , and that his only wish was to serve his country in the field . And then , with that clumsy bow of his , he sat down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a speech , but charity was precluded . The impression he gave was that of one who had nothing to say to the crowd , who did not intend to pander , and who cared not a whit for the crowd 's affection . The gathering sensed that something was wrong . A murmur of disbeliefrose as Ules returned to his seat . Ready to be lashed into a frenzy , the crowd felt disappointed and let down . It had its own image of a hero , and Ules 's indifference was not to its liking . But even less was it to the liking of the audience in the stands . Indifference to the crowd might be passed over : what could not be overlooked was indifference to them . " It was damn near an insult , " Corwin Bottomley said , riding back to Indigo . " You 'd think that he 'd let all this hoorah go to his head . There he was with a chance to show he knew how to behave , and make a few friends for himself , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God Almighty ! " and while that was one way of looking at it , John thought that another , no less tenable , was that the man on the platform was the same man who had addressed the Agricultural Society . It was not his duty to court popularity . His task was to make his vision come true . Seizing the forts was the first move in that direction . There would be others in time.  |p227Deerskin  the day after the parade , had just that morning returned to Pompey 's Head , summoned by his father through Captain Bostwick , the master of the Serena Moore  --  " The Governor sent that boy of his , Esau , with word for you , " Captain Bostwick had explained . " He says for you to stop what it is you 're doing and come home right away . " John Bottomley knew a command when he heard one . He boarded the Serena on her night trip down , wondering what the hurry was and if it might be related to Cameron . The Serena developed boiler troubleand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive in Pompey 's Head at six in the morning , she tied up at the Bay Street wharf at half-past ten . Esau was waiting in a carriage , and John drove to Indigo . " You sure took your time getting here , " Corwin said . " What did you do ? Swim ? " " I might have made better time had I. The Serena --  " " I know ! You do n't have to tell me . She broke down again ! Dammit , I 'm going to get after Bostwick one of these days ! The money I 've paid him in freightage alone would be enough to buy a new set of boilers twenty times over . You sleep on deck ? " " Yes , Father , and well . How do you feel ? " " Feel ? How do you think I feel ? I feel like a man with the colic . You been in to see your mother yet ? " " Yes sir , I just left her room . " " How did she seem ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep . What does Dr. Carpenter say ? " Corwin 's tone was a mixture of exasperation and despair . " He says what he always says , that she ought to rest her nerves . All he does is to give her opium . I do n't know . Maybe she ought to go away . She and your sister could visit the springs . She wo n't hear of it , though , and Carpenter says that she 's not well enough to make the trip . But just giving her opium ai n't going to make her well . I 'm no doctor , but I know that much . " He stared past John for a moment , brooding . " We had another one of her spells the other night . " " No , Father . Not again ! " Corwin drew in a long breath and expelled it slowly . " This timep231it was the stables . She was sure she smelled smoke , just like before . We had to call out everybody and make a search . And in the rain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with her , I 'll tell you . It must have been daylight before your sister could get her quieted down . If only there was some way --  " But it was futile even to hope . " She spoils them ! " Corwin said resentfully , wrinkling his brow into a scowl . " That 's the whole trouble ! She makes up to them , she gives them presents , she lets them feed half the yard from the kitchen . And all the time she 's afraid of them ! It 's been like that from the beginning . It goes back to when she was a little girl . They had some trouble near your grandfather Nesbitt 's place  --  two of them ran amok and tried to butcher up a family : there was nothing to do but shoot them down  --  and it must have left some kind of mark on her mind . We had one of her spells the night I brought her to Rosebank . " " I 'm sorry , Father . I know it has n't been easy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Live as long as I have and you 'll find nothing is easy . But that 's not why I asked you to come to town , to complain about your mother . It 's not her fault . She ca n't be blamed . She 's not the only one who 's afraid of them . Let the truth be known , and it might come out that we all are , in some way or other . " Ile stared past John again , his mouth half open . " It must be easy for them in the North , telling John Brown to come down here and slit our throats in Christ 's name . It do n't cost them anything to be pious . They sit up there a thousand miles away , writing books like that Uncle ' I'om woman 's , and never coming within sight or smell of one of them . But we ai n't that lucky . Half the time we might as well be African missionaries . And what thanks do we get , except to have it preached that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world and suffer eternal damnation in the next ? " " I know , Father . They do n't always understand . " " Always ? They do n't even try to understand ! But maybe they ca n't . Maybe that Uncle Tom woman is the best they can do . Me , I 'm a cruel slave owner . I feed them , I clothe them , and I look after them . But still I 'm a cruel slave owner . And why ? " Anger darkened his facep232and gave his voice a harsher tone . " Because I let my overseers use the whip if they have to ? Because I do n't believe in being soft and easy like your mother ? Because if it was n't for me and men like me the whole black tide would come pouring in ? " Since no answer was expected , John did not reply . Corwin 's teeth were clenched and his breathing was heavier than usual . He said , " Do they think we like it this way , by God ? Let that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , just for a week , and she 'd be quick to change her tune . They look human , they act human , but way down at the bottom they ai n't human ! That 's the whole plain truth of it ! Maybe they have souls , like some of the preachers say , but maybe horses and mules have souls too . Until I believe the one , I ca n't believethe other . And if that makes me a cruel slave owner , there 's nothing I can do . That 's the way it stands . " John Bottomley thought of the boy Simon asleep on the stable floor . Giving a silver dollar to Simon had been like giving a bucket of oats to the mare Delilah , and who was he to sit in judgment ? Corwinreached under the bedclothes , pulled down his nightshirt , and shifted his position against the pillows . He said , " But that ai n't why I asked you to come to town , either , to blow off steam against the Yankees . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll keep to ours . How did you leave things at Deerskin ? " There was never a time that John Bottomley came to Pompey 's Head without his father 's asking him how things had been left at Deerskin , but this time the question had some new and special importance . Again suspecting that Cameron was involved , which would account for his father 's reluctance to broach the subject , John said , " Except for those fields nearest the marsh , most of the planting is done . I 'm having a little alum trouble , but not enough to speak of . Why , Father ? Why do you ask ? " his father seemed not to know how to proceed . " What about Wilson ? " he said . " Suppose  --  well , suppose you had to leave Deerskin for a time ? Could Wilson manage ? " It was bound to be Cameron , John thought . What had happened , what could have happened , was that Cameron 's whereabouts had beenp233located , that he was sick somewhere or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask could he go and bring him home . Wanting to give himself up to the relief he felt , and yet afraid to , John said , " Yes , Father , I think Wilson can manage . He 's the one who really runs Deerskin . You know that , " and he waited for his father to say what was on his mind . " Is there something you want me to do ? Can I help in any way ? " " Yes and no , " Corwin said . " Sometime while you 're here , today or tomorrow , I 'd like for you to go and look at one of those houses your mother owns in the Channel . Roundtree 's sick and I 'm laid up , and those people are complaining about a leak in the roof . Their name 's O'Connell . But that 's not why I sent for you , either . I would n't want to take you away from planting just for a thing like that . Your mother would be wise to sell those houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's willing to pay a decent price . I do n't like having that kind of property in the family . " " Neither do I. But you still have n't said why you sent for me . What is it you want me to do ? " Corwin rubbed the end of his nose . " You 're putting it the wrong way , " he said . " It 's not what I want you to do . It 's more on the order of something you might want to do for yourself . " " But what is it , Father ? Why do n't you say ? If only you 'd come out with it --  " Corwin bridled , sitting up straight . " Now you hold your horses ! " There are some things that ca n't be spilled out all at once ! Have you heard the news about Stanhope ? " " No sir , I have n't . " " Here then ! Read it for yourself . It just came out this morning . You 'll find it on the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having permitted himself to hope , John felt his spirits sag . He reached for the copy of the News his father held out to him . A DISASTROUS SELECTION , the heading of a frontpageeditorial said , and in the editorial Gup Monckton trained his guns on Senator Stanhope . Sawdust statesman . Proved incompetent . Weakest link in a chain of weak links . A mistake that cried out to bep234rectified . And it was then , glancing up from the newspaper , that John said he knew this would happen and was asked by his father did he expect him to lose any sleep over what that bookkeeper said in the News . " No , I do n't , " John said . " You 'll sleep all right , I reckon . This is what you wanted , is n't it ? You must be feeling pretty good . " " With the colic ? And with all the work I have to do ? I have to admit , though , that I 'm pleased with the way things turned out . We could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's puzzling you ? " " Our friends the Moncktons , " John said . " According to Gup , the new constitution is practically identical with the one we 've been living under . He is especially outraged over the article forbidding the importingof slaves . It was put in , he says , to mollify the North . Listen to this . What is there in this new constitution to prevent the Union from being reconstructed ? ' We will have run a round circle , and end where we started . ' " " All right ! " Corwin hunched forward belligerently . " So the bookkeeper'snose is out of joint ! It 's too bad , ai n't it ? " John thought it might be . Gup 's dissatisfaction was probably not too important , but what about Ules ? Piece together some of his remarksbefore the Agricultural Society and some of his conversation at the Light Infantry Ball , and it was not too much to suspect that the attack on the new government was as much his doing as Gup 's . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , " John said . " Gup may have written the editorial , but I have an idea it was Ules who held the pen . Cup 's being passed over in favor of Senator Stanhope probablyangers him , but his real anger is against the new government . " Corwin had not relaxed his belligerent pose . " Suppose it is . Does he think he can rule the roost ! " " That I do n't know . I would n't be too surprised , though , if he would n't like to . And there 's one thing you forget . He 's still the hero of the hour . Should he come out in the open and continue these attacks --  " But Corwin had had enough . He said , " Now you listen to me ! Whatp235do you think three quarters of politics is , except attacks ? Do n't you by to teach me my A B C 's ! There 's no way of pleasing everybody , and there will always be those who know how to do things better than you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to buy that wharf , and Tom Thrall 's coming here with the papers for me to sign . I ca n't waste all morning talking to you . Let 's get down to why I sent for you . How would you like to be on Stanhope 's staff ? " It came so suddenly that John 's mind went blank . He stared at his father dumfoundedly . He said weakly , " Me ? " Corwin gave a sort of lurch beneath the sheets . " Yes , dammit , you . You 'll have the rank of captain . It 'll put you at the center of things . What do you say ? " Beneath his dumfoundedness John thought he was going to laugh  --  the cunning of this man who was his father , sick in bed with the colic ! He could imagine the scene between him and Senator Stanhope . " I 'll get behind you , " he would have said , " and I 'll work to get the others behind you , including Wingfield Manning . What do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table . What I want out of it , if the thing comes off , is a place for my son . Not any old place . Somewhere close to the top , on your staff . Is it agreed ? " Looking at Corwin , who was hunched forward from the waist and watching him intently , John could not restrain a chuckle  --  the old , devious , bald-headed scoundrel ! " You 're closer to Tupichichi than I imagined , " he said . " And now I 'm sure he was a Yankee Indian . What did Senator Stanhope say when you told him I was part of the deal ? " " What deal ? " Corwin looked indignant . " You must be crazy . There was no deal . This was Stanhope 's idea , not mine . " Corwin said that in his opinion John could do worse than accept the offer . " You may be able to make a real contribution , " he added . " The way it stands now , with the cotton crowd running things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled up with riffraff . Well , practically . And who knows ? You say that all you want is to be a planter , but maybe later on , ten or twelve years from now , you may change your mind and decide to go into politics . This kind of experience wo n't hurt you any . Wingfield Manning is going to be ourp236next governor , that much is certain , but Manning does n't intend to stop at being governor , and maybe someday , if the idea appeals to you -- John hardly listened . He was thinking he had no choice , that the debate over what he was going to do with himself had gone on long enough , and that he could not ask his father to bear another disappointment . And also he was thinking of Lydia Stanhope . There would be many times when , as a member of the Senator 's official family , he would find himself in her presence . What gain he hoped for , he could not say . The promise of proximity was enough . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When am I supposed to give an answer ? " " Today . Stanhope is waiting for you to call . " " Have you any idea what my duties will be ? " " No , not exactly . Stanhope wo n't be able to tell you much about that , either . He does n't know his own yet . Internal defenses . That could mean anything they want it to mean , from transportation to currency . My notion is that you 'll probably be working close to the War Department , but that 's only a guess . Did I tell you that you would be an under-secretary ? " " No , you did n't . You must have driven a hard bargain . " Corwin began to look irritated . " I told you once , did n't I , that there was no bargain and that this whole thing was Stanhope 's idea . Now you get over to his place . He 's leaving in the morning and wants to talk to you . " " In the morning ? I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll have at least a week to arrange your affairs . And do n't you worry about Deerskin . I 'm thinking of throwing it and Cornwall into one . I 'll put Wilson in charge and let that new overseer at Cornwall work under him . I 'm disappointed in that fellow . The work seems more than he can handle . Ile writes that he 's not finished repairing those dikes yet and is going to be late with some of his planting . That , though , ai n't his fault altogether . If your brother Cameron had done what he should have done at Cornwall , instead of letting it go to rack and ruin --  "  |p237He  cut himself short , startled , caught in the predicament of having mentioned Cameron 's name . Outside , in one of the trees , a redbird began singing , stopped , and started singing again . Made uneasy by his father 's embarrassment , and wanting to rescue him from it , John said , speaking the first thing that came into his mind , " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went wrong somewhere . Perhapsif he had n't been forced into being a planter --  " " Forced ! " Corwin sat straight up , his eyes blazing . " That 's what your mother says . Listen to her and it 's all my fault ! Is that what you think too ? Forced ! By God , when I look back on all the things I 've done for him , the money I 've spent and the chances he 's had , and now to have him sneak off like some damn chicken thief --  " John put out his hand . " Please do n't get angry , Father . I do n't like what 's happened any more than you do . But ca n't we talk about it calmly and quietly ? Getting this excited is n't good for you . " Corwin looked at John sternly , his brows bunched above his nose , and then , as if the tensions caused by Cameron 's disappearance had suddenly given way , his whole body went tired and slack . " All right , " the said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been playing detective , have n't you ? Why did he run away ? " " I do n't know . " " Do you know where he is ? " " No sir , I do n't . " " So you have n't been able to find out anything . Is that it ? " A bundle of workingman 's clothes , a letter that could be either M or W , and Cameron 's saddle in Allbright 's shop  --  " Yes , Father , " John said , " that 's it , " and though he did not like to lie it seemed better to lie , at least for the moment , than to spread out these scattered fragmentsthat might not even be part of the same puzzle . Looking through the window , John rested his eyes upon the dark green stillness of one of the trees . The branches spread close to the window , hung with moss . " May I ask you a question , Father ? Do you know why he ran away ? " Resting for the moment against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a coward , " he said . " Because he 's never been manp238enough to stand up to anything . Because he 's in some kind of trouble that 's too big to hide behind your mother 's skirts . Because he 's turned into a common , ordinary , down-in-the-gutter drunk . " " Why say these things , Father ? Why hurt yourself ? " " Hurt myself ? " Corwin 's voice became strained . " How ? By not making excuses for him the way your mother does ? What do you want me to do ? Pretend that he 's the kind of decent , honorable son a man can be proud of ? What am I , a fool ? " He looked straight into John 's eyes . " If you take my advice you 'll forget him . Say that it 's good riddanceto bad rubbish . Now that he 's gone away , pray that he stays away . " John thought it was anger speaking , along with disappointment and hurt pride , but as he saw the coldness on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw beneath the flabby cheeks , he realized that his father meant every word . Corwin said , dropping his voice , " I no longer recognize him as my son . He is not to enter this house again , " and when John replied , protesting , " Do n't say that , Father . Think of Mother , " Corwin 's eyes began to blaze again . He said , " You are not to give me instructions , you understand ! This is my house and I am still the master here ! I say he is not my son ! " " But Father --  " " I remind you not to give me instructions . He is not my son , and if you take my advice you will forget he is your brother . You will be wise not to make any further inquiries . Leave bad enough alone . Arc you so free of trouble that you have to borrow more ? Sometimes I think it 's a habit you have . But this time , if you know what 's good for you --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both he and John turned their heads in the door 's direction . The door opened a crack , and Missy 's voice said , " May I come in , Father ? Is Johnny with you ? " Corwin raised his arms and dropped them on the littered bedclothesin a gesture of despair . He said , " All right , come in ! Let 's have a damn reception ! " and Missy , opening the door , ran to John and gave him a hug . " I 've been downtown , " she said . " Esau just told me you were here . Have you had breakfast ? "  | " No , I have n't . The Serena was hours late . " " Why did n't you say you had n't eaten ? " Corwin asked . " How was I to know ? Go with your sister and let her feed you , and then get over to Stanhope 's . I told him you 'd be there before dinnertime . " John , leaving the room with Missy , stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I appreciate all you did for me . " Corwin looked irritated . " How many times do I have to tell you --  " And then , reaching for a sheaf of unopened letters , " All right ! " he said . " If you want to be bullheaded , be bullheaded ! Go get some breakfast and leave me alone . You two may be able to trifle , but I have work to do . "  |p241John  ate a second helping of ham and hominy and drank a third cup of coffee . Missy , sitting at the dining-room table with him , said , " You were hungry , were n't you ? I wish you 'd take care of yourself . You look thin . It 's not good for you to live all alone at Deerskin . " John started to say did n't she know he would n't be living at Deerskinmuch longer , and caught himself just in time . Missy 's not having mentioned his going into the government meant it was still a secret . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If I 'm thin , I 'm glad . I needed to lose some weight . " " Lose any more and you 'll be a beanpole . You must have lost ten pounds . What made you come to town ? You and Papa did n't have a fight , did you ? " " Of course not . What gave you that idea ? " " Papa 's voice , I guess . I could hear him through the door and I thought he sounded angry . Was it about Cam ? " " Yes , in part . " Missy looked tired and pale . " Poor Cam . I thought it was bad before , with him and Papa fighting all the time , but this is even worse . Where is he , Johnny ? Have n't you found out anything at all ? " John shook his head . " Tell me about you . How 's Gordon ? What 's the news ? " Missy looked at him soberly . There were faint blue circles under her eyes , John noticed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bright and lively , were dull and troubled , not far from tears . Reaching for her hand , John said , " Something 's wrong . Whatp242is it ? Tell me , " and Missy , shrugging her shoulders , said , " It 's  --  oh , I do n't know . Everything ! Cam 's gone , Papa 's sick and getting more and more bad-tempered all the time , just because he 's sick and worriedand has too much to do , and then these spells of Mama 's on top of it all --  " She stopped abruptly , giving him a guarded glance . " Did Papa tell you about the other night ? " " Yes , he did . " Missy touched her fingers to her eyes . " It was awful , Johnny . Mama 's had bad spells before , but never one like that . She did n't even know me . All the time she kept weeping and screaming , saying they were trying to burn us up and had murdered Cam somewhere in the woods . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just last night she said that Septima was trying to poison her and that she could taste something bitter in a glass of water . " The tears , so valiantly restrained , could be held back no longer . Through them , and with her head raised higher , as if trying to rise above the humiliation they imposed , Missy said , " I 'm frightened , Johnny . I do n't know what to do . Papa does n't seem to realize it , and neither does Dr. Carpenter , but I 'm afraid Mama is losing her mind . " John reached for her hand again . " You get hold of yourself . If you start imagining things --  " " I 'm not imagining things ! " Missy said . " Listen to me , Johnny ! Do n't treat me the way Papa does , as if I did n't have sense enough to fill a thimble . I mean what I say ! Mama 's not herself any more . She has n't been since Cam went away . Do you know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her after breakfast ? She said , Why do you have on your best dress ? '  --  this old thing , she meant . Have you not been told that it is unseemly for a young lady to wear her best clothes to school ? ' You see what I mean , Johnny ? You see ! She thinks I 'm still at Huntington Hall . " Two big , slow tears rolled down Missy 's cheeks . " Here , use this , " John said , and after she wiped her eyes with his handkerchief and sniffed discreetly , he said , " That 's no way to blow a nose . It wo n't come off , " but Missy was beyond cheering . " She 's losing her mind , Johnny . I know she is . What are we going to do ? "  | " I 'll have to think . Have you discussed this with Father ? " " Yes , but not really , " Missy said . " I tried to , but he would n't listen . You know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's all because of Mama 's nerves and that she ought to go to the springs . But when she does n't even know me , Johnny , and thinks I 'm still at lluntington Hall --  " " Perhaps it 's the laudanum , " John said . " You know what it is , do n't you ? A derivative of opium . It could be , if Mother has been taking too much of it -- - " Missy 's eyes opened wider . She said , " Do you really think so ? Yes , that could be it , could n't it ? " and her face so shone with relief that John wished he had not floated such a frail , perilous straw . " That 's just a guess on my part , you understand , " he said . " I do n't want to build up any false hopes . And perhaps Father is right . It could be only her nerves . " " Oh , Johnny , you know better than that ! You know as well as I do --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John said . " Meanwhile there 's one thing I 've made up my mind about . We 'll have to get someone to stay with you . This is too much for you to handle alone . What about Aunt Mary Nesbitt ? She 's been wanting to make a visit , and now seems like a good time . " " No , Johnny , absolutely no . " Missy sat up straight . " Aunt Mary Nesbitt is seventy-five years old and so crippled with rheumatism she can hardly move . Besides , she 's almost as bad about them as Mama , except that she 's able to hide it better . I do n't need Aunt Mary Nesbitt . What I wish , though --  " " Yes ? " " Oh , it 's no use . You would n't . " " Would n't what ? " Missy looked at him steadily . " Come here to live . You do n't have to bury yourself at Deerskin . You could look after it from town just is well . That 's what Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Though it was n't as simple as Missy made it sound , with a few rearrangements it could be managed . Except that it was impossible.  |p244Matters  had been taken out of his hands and he was n't going to be a planter any longer . Not for some time , anyway . " Wo n't you , Johnny ? " Missy said . " It would be good for everybody . You 're the only one Papa will listen to , even a little , and I know that Mama , if you came to live with us --  " " I ca n't , Missy . I 'm going away . " Missy stared at him . " Going away ? Where ? Do you have to ? " Of course he did n't have to . For him to refuse Senator Stanhope 's offer would disappoint his father , but by any sensible measure his place was here . Except that it was still impossible . The matter was settled and he was glad to have it settled . He said : " You must n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been named to the cabinet of the new government . I 'm to be on his staff . " He expected Missy 's face to light up and a rush of excitement to come , and it suddenly struck him as she looked at him quietly , saying nothing , that this was n't quite the same Missy any more . Ile said : " Now that you know that much , you might as well know the rest of it . Father more or less took things into his own hands . He helped line up support for Senator Stanhope , and now the Senator is paying off his debt . It seems that I was made part of the deal . " " That 's not true , " Missy said . " Senator Stanhope wanted you from the very beginning . Arbell told me . " " Arbell told you ? " Missy 's face brightened somewhat . " All these great big secrets , " she said . " But you 're wrong in thinking it was Father 's idea . Senator Stanhope 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arbell heard him talking about it to Lydia . He said he would rather have you on his staff than anyone he knew . His wanting you may have caused Father to help him , that 's true enough , but it was the Senator who thought of it first . " Perhaps , John thought ; just perhaps . He and Senator Stanhope had been on purely formal terms since the Senator 's marriage to Lydia  --  in all that time he had set foot in the Stanhope house but twice , once for a New Year 's Eve party he could not get out of , andp245once when Lydia had that English author in tow . Why , then , out of t lie blue , should the Senator want him on his staff ? Apparently his father had been truthful in saying it had been Senator Stanhope 's idea , and he could feel he was n't completely a pawn , but something , somewhere , was left unexplained . " So you knew all about it ? " " I knew that much , " Missy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know if it was just talk , or what , and certainly I did n't know the Senatorhad got what he was after . Or what Lydia was after . By all rights , she 's the one who should be in the cabinet . " " Why do you say that ? " " You know why , " Missy said , " you know perfectly well why , " and there might have been the faintest trace of sarcasm in her voice . " Why do you want to pretend ? " she asked . " Lydia is possessed to be somebody . You know that . Arbcll says she wo n't be content until the Senator is President . " John wished he could change the subject : there were too many pitfalls . He said , " Does she now ? That 's very interesting . And she still talks too much , I see . " " No , not really . Just to me . " " Let 's not get off on Arabella . Do you understand why I ca n't come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Missy watched him closely , grave and composed . " Yes , Johnny , I understand . And do n't worry about me . I 'll be able to manage . But tell me . Is this what you want to do , being on the Senator 's staff ? " John needed time to think . " That 's a hard question . There 's most likely to be a war , since so many people are insisting on it --  " " And you do n't want to be left behind . Is that it ? I would n't either , if I were a man . " " That 's one way of putting it . " " You feel you have to do something , and it might as well be this . It has n't been easy for you , has it , Johnny ? " " What has n't ? " " This whole thing . "  | " No , it has n't , now that you ask . But now , if you 'll excuse me , I must be going . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good breakfast every morning . I do n't like seeingyou this thin . Would you like another cup of coffee ? " " No , three is enough . Besides , I 'm due at the Stanhopes ' . It may be that Father had nothing to do with this , as you ask me to believe , but he has n't been above taking care of a few odds and ends . " " Like what ? " " Like arranging this appointment with the Senator . " " Do n't blame him , Johnny . He ca n't help it . Do you think you 'll be seeing Arbell ? " " Seeing her was n't part of my plan . " " Now there you go again . You never give her a chance . You do n't even try . Not even a little . I wish you 'd be nicer to her . " " Now there you go again . " Missy shook her head . " No , this time it 's different . It really is . I 'm worried about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what will happen to her when the Senator goes away . " " What are you talking about , she does n't know what will happen to her ? You make it sound as though she were going to be homeless . " Missy frowned . " You do n't understand about Arbell . You do n't want to . Everything 's been different for her since the Senator married again . In a way , she might just as well be homeless right now . " " How can you ask me to believe anything like that ? It 's too ridiculous ! " " That 's what you think . You do n't know how hard it is for two women to live under the same roof . Lydia 's made Arbell feel she gets in the way . " " Are you sure you know what you 're talking about ? This sounds like the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society to me . " " Does it ? And have you ever stopped to consider that some of the things said at the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is that what you 're saying ? " " Yes . " " Flow do you know ? "  | " Because I 've seen it happen . " " Seen it happen ? " " Yes , with my own eyes . Little snubs and little impolitenesses . What you do n't seem to realize is that that is n't Senator Stanhope 's house any more . It 's Lydia 's . You always seemed inclined to take up for Lydia  --  why , I do n't know --  " " Take up for her ? What gave you that idea ? " " Lots of things , Johnny . You must n't mind my saying so . And it 's not true that I do n't know why . You 've been on her side from the very beginning . I could see it happening . You think she has been unfairly treated because of who she was , coming from Gunpowder Street and all , and so naturally --  " That he should be brought to confusion by Missy was a new experience for John . He said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find out better . It 's true that I think Mrs. Stanhope has been unfairly treated --  " " Mrs. Stanhope , " Missy said . " All right then , Lydia . It 's true I think she has been unfairly treated , but I 'm astonished I ever let it show . It 's not that important to me . But you were saying that Arabella is upset over what will happenwhen the Senator leaves . Why ? You 're not implying that Lydia is trying to turn her out , are you ? " " Now who said anything silly as that ? Even if things were that bad , as they are n't , Lydia would n't go that far . She would n't want to offendthe Senator , just for one thing . " " What 's the problem then ? I do n't understand . " " Well , the thing is that Arbell --  " But John was beginning to get bored . " Do you want a prediction ? Your friend Arabella will move to the capital with the Senator , she will open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things begin to get too dull for her , as apparently they are now , she will blow up another storm . I 'm afraid I ca n't feel sorry for Arabella Stanhope . " " Sometimes you make me tired , " Missy said . " You 're getting more and more like Papa every day . You do n't approve of Arbell and neverp248have , and so everything she does is wrong . But that does n't mean that everything Lydia does is right . I used to like her when she taught at Huntington Hall , but I do n't any more . And she is n't kind to Arbell . That 's the plain simple truth of it . I 'm not saying it 's all Lydia 's fault or that Arbell is n't partially to blame , but things are getting to the point --  Oh , never mind ! It does n't matter . You 're not interested a fig . " That I ca n't wholly deny , " John said . " But apparently it does matter , at least to you . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're right , " Missy said . " There 's nothing anyone can do . I just thought that if you saw Arbell you might try to be nice to her . Just for my sake . Will you ? " and she went into her trick of fluttering her eyelids . " And do you want to know something else about Arbell ? " she asked . " Something that will really make you mad ? I think she 's falling in love with Neville Monckton , " and then , seeing the look on his face , " You see ! " she said . " I knew you 'd get mad . I 'm sorry I told you . I should have let you find out from somebody else . " John rose from the table . He said , " Trust her to make a mess of things ! " and Missy gave him an unhappy , pleading look . " Do n't be too hard on her , Johnny , " she said . " I should n't have told you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious or not , " and John carne to the end of his patience . " Of course it is n't serious ! " he said . " When has anything been seriouswith her ? Neville Monckton fools around with a fieldpiece and comes back a hero --  " " That 's what I think too , " Missy said . " That 's it exactly . It all started at the ball the night of the parade , the one you would n't go to . Neville was there , wearing a brand-new uniform and with his arm in a sling , and Constance Pettibone was making a fool of herself , just as Arbell said she would --  " " Spare me the details , " John said . " Constance Pettibone takes ashine to the handsome hero , and Arabella says , ' No , you ca n't havehint I 'll show you who 's boss , ' and so , out of nothing but vanity --  " " That 's not fair , " Missy broke in . " I know Arabella gives some pco/ple that impression because of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault . Can she be blamed for being so attractive ? " John started for the door . " Look , Missy . Defending Arabella is a waste of time . She 's run through all the eligible men in town , and so now , with time on her hands --  " " You really do n't like her , do you ? " Missy said . " I used to think you merely pretended you did n't , and enjoyed being gruff , but now I know better . It 's funny . Arbell says mean things about you sometimes , that you 've turned into an old disagreeable hermit and things like that , but still , in all the years I 've known her --  " " I have to go , Missy . I 've wasted enough time as it is . " Missy pushed back her chair . " You 're all upset about Arbell , are n't you ? " she said , rising . " Is it because you think she should n't be having anything to do with Neville Monckton ? Is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " John interrupted . " That 's one of the basic laws . But this time your friend Arabella has truly given them something to chew on . Have you seen this morning 's editorial in the News ? " " You know I hate editorials . What was it about ? " " It was about  --  what it was about was that Senator Stanhope no more belongs in the cabinet than my dog Tray , and that Arabella , as his daughter , should have more sense than to get involved with Neville Monckton . " " You 're making it up . It did n't say that , did it ? " " Read it for yourself . People who hate editorials should be left to stew in their own ignorance . And now I 'm going . Do you want to ride over to the Stanhopes ' with me ? " " I have to stay with Mama . Dr. Carpenter has n't come yet this morning , and I want to be here when he calls . And , Johnny --  " " Yes ? " " Promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That you do n't worry about me . I 'll be able to manage when you go away . I promise . You wo n't worry , will you ? " A year ago , six months ago , he would have said , " Wong ? Of course 1 ' 11 worry . Ilow can I not ? " but during the past few weeks some line249TILE LIGHT INFANTRY BALLhad been crossed , some forward step taken , and this was n't the same Missy any more . He said , " No , I wo n't worry , " and bent down and kissed her cheek . " What 's that for ? " Missy asked . " F'or just this once . Do n't get any notions . " " Never fear , " Missy said . " I won't. "  |p250It  was a sign of Lydia 's influence in the Stanhope household that the butler was in full plum-colored livery , with white silk stockings , and square silver buckles on his shoes . No other establishment in Pompey 's Head went quite that far . Full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finery  --  Amos , his name was  --  could be taken as another example of Lydia 's increasing confidence . Amos answered John 's knock , took his hat , showed him to the double parlor , asked him please to wait , and went off to find the Senator . Left alone , John looked about the room . The curtains were looped back from the windows , and the bright sunlight , falling through a smell of wax and polish , splashed across the floor . The room , recently done over , looked different to John . He remembered it as more crowded , cluttered to the point of fussiness , and he noticed that the ancestral portraits were gone , the Senator 's family tree . Missy was right : this was n't the Senator 's house any longer , it was Lydia 's  --  her broom had swept clean , making it her own . John 's thoughts were interrupted by the strike of a clock on the mantel , starting the count of twelve . A second clock took up the strike in the hall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally the clocks were quiet , seemed heavier than before . A woman 's voice broke into it , coming angry and muffled from somewhere on the upper floor . " Why must you object . . . everything I want to do .. . not accountable . . . if you imagine . . . " A quieter , firmer voice responded , less distinct " . . . your father . . . sense of obligation . . . not asking that you be accountable . . . " For a few moments , like the striking of the clocks , the two voices were merged in a heated argumentthat for an instant became markedly louder  --  " Always my fa/tiler ! Will you ever stop using him as an excuse ! "  --  and was then ended abruptly by the slamming of a door . Footsteps raced down the stairs , and John caught a glimpse of Arabella , in a dark brown riding habit , sweeping past the door . She must have caught sight of him at the last instant . She stopped , turned around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deerskin , " she said . " Or should I say the hermit ? To what , dear sir , do we owe this pleasure ? " " I 'm calling on your father , " John said , conscious too late of how wooden he sounded . " Amos has gone to say I 'm here . I suspect the Senator must be in his office in the garden . Had I known --  " " And deprive us of this visit ? " Arabella tilted her head slightly to one side . " We see you all too rarely as it is . Flow long has it been since you favored us with your presence ? A year ? Two ? Truly , Mr. Bottomley , what a delicious surprise ! " John knew these moods and the meaning of this stilted language  --  Arabella , in a fit of temper , was taking it out on him . Uncomfortable at having been surprised in the role of eavesdropper , he said : " Let 's do n't fight , Arabella . Mow have you been ? " Arabella held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My health is excellent , Mr. Bottomley . How kind of you to ask , " and then , in a sudden change of mood and with a gentler look in her eyes , " Oh , I 'm all right , Johnny , " she said . " And I did n't mean to be disagreeable . It 's just that I never see you any more , and then , when I do , the first thing you say is that you 're here only to call on Papa . You might have at least said good morning . " " You did n't give me a chance . The first thing you said was what was I doing here . I can think of more hospitable greetings . " Arabella began to smile . " Not only am I graceless , I 'm badtempered . Let 's start all over . I 'll see what I can remember from my lessons in deportment . Good morning , Mr. Bottomley . How happy I am to see you . Wo n't you sit down ? And have we not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , we have , " John said . " We were able to get nearly all our plantingdone , " and Arabella , after a moment of trying not to , broke into **25;1273;TOOLONG and married to a friend  --  was typical , if repeated accurately , and he thought it had been . " The Saxes are turning a scandal into a glory . That 's making the family a law unto itself . " If that was the kind of remark you got from your friends , you did n't need enemies . Not that it made much difference to him . He was running a newspaper , so to hell with it . Sooner or later , if you were running a newspaper , you got in the last word .

The red-haired woman had n't left a name and the kid had n't even had a birth certificate , not one that anybody could locate . Legally , apparently , she had n't been born  --  but there she was , a living , breathing kid , confused , lonesome and bitched up so bad that for a while she would n't even talk to anyone . A kid not listed in the books , but the right age to have the dates check out . Red Margaret 's kid . That much her physical resemblance established beyond a doubt . That had been enough for Jessica . She 'd packed her up and taken the next train . Neither he nor she had ever later wanted to mess around with the blood tests to determine paternity or any of that rigmarole . The child could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you 'd had a child by a Hottentot or an Indian , I would have felt it was ours , " she 'd said to him once ; " any child of yours , anywhere in the world , is ours , not any other woman 's . Mine . Because you 're mine . " He 'd almost laughed at the romanticism of that . But , again , that was Jessica for you . He 'd asked her seriously , and he thought sensibly , if she had n't wanted to have the Bureau of Missing Persons check for Margaret . Jessica said she did n't . He 'd had a hunch that Jessica felt the woman was dead , that leaving Pamela in the home had been her way of checking out . And there had been no doubt of the fact that she was very ill . One thing was for sure  --  he 'd had no regrets . Or perhaps only one  --  that if it had been in the cards to work out this way it could n't have happened a little sooner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , growing up ; as it was , Alexandra ,  |p101then  four , and Sharon , almost three , had been a unit , knit together with kid-stubbornness and kid-snobbery to resist the new-little-sister and **37;1300;TOOLONG build-up that he and Jessica had given Pamela . Kids were that way . There was n't anything you could do about it except wait for the hoard of humanness and slowly experimenting friendliness that kids put into all their activities to take effect and , little by little , overcome the resistance and strangeness  --  a resistance and strangeness exaggerated somewhat , perhaps , by Pamela 's being the way she 'd been then : a silent and suspicious little thing . Nobody could say it had n't come to be all right . It had , and if , as young adulthood set in , the girls had tended to go their separate ways again , that , too , was to be expected . There was no harm in it . They were vital girls , all of them  --  each a force in her own way and each interesting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They might even find out a few things they did n't know ; and if they still felt Jessica was a traitor to her class and he some kind of illuminated upstart or , as Fabian Rupke had once called him , " a throwback , " that was all right too ; they would be dancing to the traitor 's music tonight , they would be drinking the upstart 's wine . Anchylus Saxe drew a slow breath , testing the integrity of the pique vest . It held . Pleased with this , he dabbed with gold-backed brushes at his iron mop of hair . In front of him , in a small vase , tilted a white carnation , put there by Jessica with instructions as to what was to be done with it . Anchylus , as directed , stuck it into his buttonhole . He went down the great stair of his house to the place where , midway between the foot of it and the open door of the ballroom , the receivingline was to be and where his wife and his adopted daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Temple , the butler , hovered at the front door , ready to open it at the ring of the first guest . " Where 's Sharon and Alexandra ? " he demanded . " I 'm afraid they may be dawdling , dear , " Jessica said . " Perhaps I ought to go up and call them . " Anchylus pulled out his watch and looked at it . He still had it on the gold chain he 'd bought while he worked in Fabian Rupke 's pressroom . " No , " he said . " It 's nine o'clock , straight up . Pamela and I do n't want to be left here all alone . You 'd better tell Temple to do it . " " All right , " Jessica said . " Will you please , Temple ? "  |p102And  Temple , with a ducking , assenting movement of his pale , blue-veined butler face , toddled off toward the house telephone in his pantry. 3 BOTH Anchylus and Jessica knew that the girls had been moving apart as they grew up . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or knowing how it had been prodded along by neighbor talk and school talk and backstairs servant talk . Children got to find things out . After they did , they took action . Several incidents had shown which way the wind was blowing , one in particular  --  although knowledge of this had leaked through to the older people only in snatches , its real scope and significance not beingrevealed until much later on . This certain Saturday Gertrude Donovan , a girl in Alexandra 's class at Miss Burke 's , had invited Alexandra and Sharon to have lunch at the Fairmont and go to a matinee of Katherine Hepburn in Little Women . Then at the last minute Gertrude had come down with a cold . Mrs. Donovan telephoned Jessica to suggest that her husband , Oakleigh , could still meet the girls and give them lunch . He would enjoy it , and it would be far better than calling off the date . Jessica agreed with this ; but it appeared there was one hitch . Oakleigh Donovan could not stay for the picture . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls to the theater and bought their tickets ? They could see the movie , which was said to be quite wonderful . Then Jessica could pick them up or they could come home in a taxi . Jessica said she did n't mind . It would have been better if the car could have picked them up after the theater . She would have felt a little easier about it , that way . Still , Anchylus was using the Pierce Arrow and she herself had an Altar Guild meeting at the Cathedral . So under the circumstances a taxi would be quite all right , provided Alexandra and Sharon came straight home . The lunch turned out to be pleasant . Alexandra had lobster cocktail and lamb chops and Sharon had fruit cocktail and roast beef and they both had baked Alaska for dessert . Mr. Donovan had a hard roll and five martinis . He made jokes all through lunch . After signing the check and having one martini for the road he took them to the theater and bought the tickets , leading them right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off his hat to sayp103goodbye he shook hands with Sharon , then put his arm around Alexandra and kissed her . Sharon felt that without the martinis he would not have done this . She had noticed in the last year or so even old family friends who had been in the habit of kissing them both now seemed to concentrate on her older sister , especially the men . Alexandra 's dimensions were very good , and you missed none of them in the dress she was wearing . She was the only girl in Miss Burke 's who could look beautiful in a plain wool dress with a white Buster Brown collar , and it was her dimensions , Sharon felt , that did it . " I hope you both enjoy the show , " Mr. Donovan said . " We will , Mr. Donovan , " Alexandra said . " Thank you so much for the tickets . And for the lunch . " " Thank you so much , Mr. Donovan , " Sharon echoed dutifully . But Mr. Donovan had already put his hat back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of her . As they walked out onto the thick carpet of the lobby , the head usher flipped his hand up . He produced one finger from a bunch of fingers with a snappy motion , like a person opening a spring knife , and intoned , " First aisle to your left .... " Alexandra did n't move . She was looking back toward the curb , where Mr. Donovan 's taxi could be seen driving off . The main feature had just gone on . People were still pouring from the lobby into the darkened area in front of the screen . The head usher asked Alexandra if he could see her stubs but Alexandra said , " There 'll be no need of that , " and dropped the stubs on the carpet . To the usher 's amazement she took Sharon and dragged her out of the theater . They went along Market Street toward Montgomery . " What is it , Zan ? " Sharon asked , hanging back and almost weepingin her disappointment and annoyance . " Why ca n't we see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alexandra said , " so shut up . And when we get there , let me do the talking . " They went to the offices of Galt , Winterhalter &; Dudley . Alexandra asked the girl at the reception desk if she could speak to Mr. Dudley . Both girls knew Mr. Dudley because he frequently dined at the California Street house , and it was a relief to Sharon to realize that in this strange place they were about to see someone they knew . She had not yet recovered from her disappointment about missingp104Little Women . She felt miserable and fidgeted on the slippery seat of the big leather chair in the waiting room . Alexandra sat quietly , holding her gloves and looking at the wall . They had not been waiting long when an inner door opened and Mr. Dudley came out . " Well , for heaven 's sake , " he said . " Alexandra ! How are you ? And Sharon ! Well , well ! Is anyone with you , or did you drop in all by yourselves ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandra said . " Well , I 'm delighted to see you , " Mr. Dudley said . " Could we go into your office , Mr. Dudley ? " Alexandra asked . " Why , of course , " Mr. Dudley said in a more professional way , grateful for being prompted . " Wo n't you come in ? " Mr. Dudley was a cheerful , squarish man with a pink , fleshy face and thick , black eyebrows . He had very shrewd yet kindly blue eyes , and the hair on the top of his head was starting to get thin . Sharon rather liked him . In the office where he now took them she wiggled in another slippery-bottomed chair and studied the gleam of skin that could be seen through Mr. Dudley 's hair on top . " I thought at first the girl might have sent in the wrong name  --  that she meant Mrs. Saxe instead of the Misses Saxe . What in the world are you two doing way downtown ? " " We came down to see a movie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see , " Mr. Dudley said . Sharon opened her mouth to say she had not wanted to leave , but Alexandra shut her up with a look . " My sister and I , " Alexandra said , " would both appreciate it if you did n't mention to our parents that we came to see you . It is rather confidential . We happen to need some advice on a legal point of law . " " Well , that 's what we 're here for , " Mr. Dudley said good-naturedly , " lots of people come in all the time with just the same idea . " He spoke lightly , but some of the glow had faded from his manner . Until Alexandra mentioned law he had perhaps suspected that the girls lacked cab fare home or would request financing for a couple of chocolate malts . " You see , Mr. Dudley , " Alexandra went on , " there is an adoption matter in our family . It happened some years ago . You know all about that , I 'm sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask you about . " Mr. Dudley had become quiet . From being rosy and spread-out , his face looked narrower . He pulled up his gold watch chain andp105carefully rubbed the Phi Beta Kappa key which hung from it , as less well-established men might rub a rabbit 's foot . " Well , well ! " he said . " There are one or two things we 'd like to know , " Alexandra said . Mr. Dudley poured some water in a glass from a carafe on his desk and slowly sipped it . " I 'm flattered , my dear , that you come to me , " he said , " but do n't you think that any questions on this subject could be answeredmore fittingly by someone in your own family ? Your dear mother , for instance . " " Mother wo n't tell us anything , " Alexandra said , " at least , she never has . Of course , we know more than she thinks . We know Pamela is a bastard . Illegitimate , that is . " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had been stuck with a pin . Sharon also , though she did not jerk , was shocked . Never had she heard Alexandra use these particularwords . She had n't even used them in their talks alone at night when Alexandra used quite a number of odd words , and to hear her use them now , in these strange surroundings and to a grown person , gave her a choked-up feeling . Language of this sort could be terrifying to someone who only the week before at Miss Burke 's had been sent to detention for saying ai n't . Mr. Dudley sat back in his chair jiggling his watch chain and studying Alexandra with the same narrow look . " We know that for sure , Mr. Dudley , " Alexandra said . " Not many of us , in the law business , know anything for sure , " Mr. Dudley said . " However , without inquiring how you came by this piece of information , my dear , may I ask what else you want to know ? " " We want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think I quite see what you mean . " " I mean , " Alexandra said , " is she our sister or is n't she ? Because being a bastard and living with us would n't necessarily make her our sister , would it ? Or would n't it ? That could make a big difference and we 'd like somebody to tell us . " Mr. Dudley looked at her again , but differently this time . " Well , well , " he said . He turned sideways in his chair then and looked out the window . " Yes , " he said , " well , yes . I suppose it would . " " That 's what we want to know , " Alexandra said . " You can speak freely . I know that sex comes into it , but we know about sex . At least I know about it and I 've explained quite a bit of it to Sharon . She 'll understand whatever you have to say . We both will . "  |p106Mr  . Dudley was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Alexandra , was coming here to see me your own idea , or did some other person suggest it to you ? " " It was my  --  our  --  own idea , " Alexandra said . " I see , " Mr. Dudley said . " How old are you , Alexandra ? " " I 'll be seventeen in two and a half months , " Alexandra said . " I 'm making my debut in October . Mother said I did n't have to wait until I was eighteen . She thinks I will be mature enough when I am seventeen and three months . " " She might have something there , " Mr. Dudley said . " How old are you , Sharon ? " " Fifteen , " Sharon said . " Almost fifteen and a half . " Mr. Dudley reflected . He got out of his chair and walked up and down the room . " I 'll be damned , " he said ; " excuse me , girls . " He sat down again and looked straight at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now sitting up better and trying to look older , since age seemed to have become such a big issue in this talk . " Well , girls , " Mr. Dudley said , " I 've been in law practice eighteen years , and this is the first time I  --  but never mind . . . . You 've asked me a grownup question and I 'm going to give you a grownup answer . You may as well get the facts straight . I think you 're entitled to that . " " Yes , Mr. Dudley , " Alexandra said . " All right , " Mr. Dudley said ; " now about Pamela . She came into the world as the result of a love affair , as you seem to have heard . I should certainly suggest that you do not try to judge the rights and wrongs of this until you are much older or perhaps never . Such matters are often  --  and in fact generally  --  puzzling even to much older persons . Whatever happened , you must realize that in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the . . . er . . other person involved . She was most unhappy and misguided , as such persons always are . It was a most unfortunate situation . Actuallyit concerned nobody but your father and mother , and your mother and father reached a complete understanding about it . Your mother behaved with great courage and . . . er . . . nobility , and you should never have the slightest feeling for either her or your father that is not one of admiration for the way in which they faced this difficult situation . " Mr. Dudley stopped and took another sip of water . He rubbed his Phi Beta Kappa key again . Alexandra and Sharon sat perfectly quiet and waited for him to go on.  | " There was , " he said , " the problem of the little girl and her terrible position , and in this emergency your dear mother did a most courageous thing . She went and fetched the girl , Pamela , and took her to your home . She gave the whole world to understand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child but acknowledged her and that she was to be brought up as one of you , as she has been . Those are the facts . They reflect nothing but credit on anyoneconcerned . " Alexandra by-passed the last remark as being editorial in content . She drove at the gist of what had been communicated . " You mean , she was adopted ? " Mr. Dudley nodded . " Yes , " he said , " she was adopted . Not in a formal way , but she was adopted . " " And her name is Saxe ? " " Yes . " " I do n't see how that can be , " Alexandra said . " I shall explain it to you , " Mr. Dudley said . " Damn it all anyway . I do n't know how I ever got into all this . " " Please , Mr. Dudley , " Alexandra said . " Well , now , " Mr. Dudley said , " there is a specific law that covers what you 've asked me . I think  --  yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read it for yourselves . Also  --  but one more thing ! I 'll keep my bargain with you not to tell your parents that you 've been to see me but I wo n't bind you to the same deal . If at any time , remember  --  at any time  --  you want to say where you obtained your information you can say you got it from me . Is that clear ? You can say I thought it best to answer you explicitly . " Mr. Dudley flipped a switch connected with a box on his desk . He spoke into the box . " Cal Civil two thirty , Wickett , " he said . Having given this order , Mr. Dudley sat back , watching the door . Alexandra and Sharon watched it also . Time , which had flown so fast till now , dragged painfully , though it could only have been a minute or two before the door opened and a sharp-faced , sandyhairedman in a black coat came in carrying a thick book which he handed to Mr. Dudley . " Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man lowered his sharp nose a little , then raised it again . He turned and left the room . " That was our librarian , Mr. Wickett , " Mr. Dudley said . He picked up the book , which had a slip of paper in it to mark a place , but Mr. Dudley did not seem to need the place marker ; his pale , well-kept hands flicked through the pages like the hands of ap108pianist running over a keyboard . His fingers seemed to find the place without direction from his brain . " This is Section Two Hundred and Thirty of the Civil Code of California , " he said . " I believe it will remove the doubts that seem to have been bothering you . Alexandra , you may sit here in my chair and read the paragraph which I am marking . Sharon , you may stand beside her . If , when you have read it , you have any further questions , I shall be glad to answer them . " Mr. Dudley pressed back the covers of the book so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the inner margin of the righthandpage , marking a passage with his pencil . Alexandra crossed round to him and he made her sit down in his chair , showing Sharon where she was to stand beside her . All his movements now were executedwith a precision of manner which , later in life , Sharon was to observe in lawyers when they handled books in courtrooms . Or perhaps it would be truer to say that , though she had never been in a courtroom , Mr. Dudley 's manner gave her her first impression of one . The paragraph was marked with a light bracket . Alexandra read it through slowly and in silence ; Sharon , looking over her shoulder , did the same . Memorizing things in school was never easy for her , but she memorized this paragraph when she had read it twice and for a long time afterward was able to bring it before her mind with little effort . The father of an illegitimate child , by publicly acknowledgingit as his own , receiving it as such , with the consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and otherwise treatingit as if it were a legitimate child , thereby adopts it as such ; and such child is thereupon deemed for all purposes legitimatefrom its birth. 4 AFTER HIS CALLERS had left , George Dudley sat at his desk for some time . He did n't feel quite easy in his mind about the interviewwhich had just taken place , and after giving it some thought he decided that it might be well , in order partially at least to forestall repercussions , to inform the firm 's senior partner , Hiram Galt , of what had happened . Hiram Galt had been disturbed . " All right , Hiram , " George Dudley had said , a little defensively ,  | " what would you have done if you 'd been in my shoes ? They come in here with their little bare faces hanging out and ask about their bastard sister . What would you have told them ? " " They called her a bastard ? " " They most certainly did . Or at least the older one did , Alexandra . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It sounds to me as if she 'd pinned you to the mat . " " Maybe she did . I 'm ready to admit she took me by surprise . But she had that much information . Of that I am positive . " " Perhaps she was only fishing for it . " " No . It did n't come out like that . She also told me , by way of introduction , that I could speak freely since they both knew all about sex . " " Good God . " " I ca n't help it if you approve or not , Hiram , " George Dudley said ; " I think I did the only thing possible . If I had refused to tell them they would have found out eventually from someone else , maybe gotten a completely mixed-up version . This way they know where they stand . " " I wish I knew where we stand , " Hiram Galt said glumly . " Just let their parents get wind of this and some other firm will be handling the Saxe Trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company . " " I am more worried about the old man , to tell the truth . " " I ca n't tell about him . He might go along with your thinking . It 's still even money that we lose both accounts . " " I suppose we could , but I doubt we will . " " Just let those kids start quoting Cal Civil two thirty around the house and we will . Honestly , George , there are times when I wonder about you . " " Let 's wait and see . I just do n't know what else I could have done . " " You could have kept your mouth shut , my good friend . " " Is that what you would have done ? " " I believe so . Yes ! I think I can honestly say it is . " " Saying so is easy , Hiram , " George Dudley said , " but just keep in mind you were never in the spot I was in . Damn these things anyway . They 're tough on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , " Hiram Galt said , " you 're a great man . A gentle , kindly man . But next time you want to help some kids by expounding the law of bastardy , pick kids where we do n't handle their family 's legal business . "  | " All right , Hiram , " George Dudley said . " Be a Girl Scout master or something , " Hiram Galt said , " tell them about the birds and the bees . " " Take it easy , Hiram , " George Dudley said . ALEXANDRA SAT in front of the mirror in the Lilac Room , the quarters which she shared with Sharon on the second floor of the California Street house . She was busy making up her face . Jessica had told her quite definitely that she could use lipstick , since the other girls were using lipstick , but no make-up . Alexandra had chosen to ignore the order . She was the only person in the family whose will was strong enough to oppose her mother 's but even she , pitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength ; a head-on collision would result in her undoing . She had planned therefore to dress first , just in case her mother came in while she was dressing , and put on the make-up last  --  a judicious amount of base and rouge , of mascara deftly applied , and above all not too much , to both upper and lower lashes , and of eye shadow just enough to bless her with the haunted , dissipated look she felt she must have for her debut in society : the look that was all the rage . It would n't do to be ready on time ; she must be late , or late enough , even though this was her debut , so that there would be no time for Jessica to object to her appearance or to order her to change it . She was studyingthe effect in the glass when the telephone rang ; she spoke into it briefly , then dropped the small white receiver carelessly back on its cradle . " It was Temple , " she said ; " they 're down there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment  --  the hour when something started , she was n't sure just what but more than a ball , however grand that might be . A moment of decision . " Gosh , Zan . We 'd better hurry . " " Hurrying is gauche , " Alexandra said . She took a long , slow look at herself in the mirror , then turned her head above her tapering , creamy shoulder and smiled at her sister . " How do I look , Chicken ? " " You look . . . divine . " " Divine is a gauche word ; you ought to stop using it . But thanks anyway , " Alexandra said . She stood up . She twisted her body in front of the mirror so asp111to study the smallness of her waist as compared to the fullness of her breasts and the outthrust curves of her thighs in the soft dress . She stood so for almost a minute . " You look nice too , " she said without turning . " Thanks , Zan , " Sharon said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said softly , speaking to her glittering image in the glass , " yes , I do believe that tonightI 'm going to like me . And , I 'm going to find out . . . something . But I 'm not going to tell you . Anyway , not yet . " " What , Zan ? " Sharon demanded breathlessly . " You 'll find out . " " Will you tell me ? " Alexandra considered . " I believe . . . yes . I 'll tell you . Only you . But not until I 'm sure . All right ? " " Oh , yes , Zan . Of course . " " Then it 's agreed , Chicken , " Alexandra said . She looked at her sister in a wild , conspiratorial way . Then , suddenly , she laughed . When she laughed , perhaps because of the smallness , sharpness and evenness of her teeth and the full , sumptuousway her lips curved , showing her sharp little tongue , she looked reckless  --  vicious almost , Sharon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love , and all her life , despite the fact that she herself got better marks in school , she had been led by Alexandra as by a person immeasurably older and wiser . " Is it . . . about a man ? " Sharon ventured timidly . Alexandra 's face changed . Her cheeks sucked in warningly . " You must n't ask me , or  --  nothing . ' Wait . That 's all I can say . " " All right , Zan , " Sharon said . She did n't understand Zan . That was the most exciting thing about her  --  that you never understood . It was baffling . Even about the party Alexandra had been baffling . Sharon had never thought that , after the visit to Galt , Winterhalter &; Dudley , Alexandra would stand for making a joint debut with Pamela , yet she had not resistedthe idea , had actually seemed to like it . This was all the stranger since at first , when she and Sharon had discussed what Mr. Dudley had told them , she had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share my parents with anyone , " she 'd said darkly . " Well , I know , " Sharon said , " but in a way it is n't her fault , is it ? " " Who cares whose fault it is ? " Alexandra said . " I wo n't have her putting on airs , that 's all . " " You mean you mind her being here ? " Sharon asked , puzzled.  |p112Of  the two of them , Alexandra had on the whole been nicer to Pamela than she had , right from the start  --  now so long ago . " I never minded her being here , " Alexandra said . " Then what ? " " I just do n't care too much about her having rights , " Alexandra said . " That 's where she gets the airs that she puts on . " " Gosh , Zan , I had n't noticed , " Sharon said , " you mean she 's been putting them on lately ? " " She 's always been putting them on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just wondered . Now I know . Well , they 'll find out . " " Who , Zan ? " " Everybody . " " You mean you 're going to do something ? " " You 're darn right I 'm going to do something . She 's a big phony , and she 's made everything else phony . That 's what it is . " " Maybe she ca n't help it , " Sharon said weakly . She felt it was up to her to defend Pamela somehow , even at the risk of losing her closeness to Alexandra , yet she did n't know what arguments to use in her defense . " It 's the situation , not her , " Alexandra said . " The situation just goes with the airs she puts on . Do n't you see ? " " You 'd better tell me , Zan . " " Well , it 's very simple . We were supposed to be so proud of everything . Our house , our school , our manners . Blab , blah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have better manners and get better marks than anybody to make up for her . That 's why it 's all so phony . And I 'll tell you something else : everybody probably knows about her . They know everything about you in this town . It makes me sick . " " Probably , " Sharon said desperately , " probably a few people know , but not everybody . We did n't even know until  --  " " If a few people know , " Alexandra said , " then everybody knows . Well , I 'm not going to stick around here long . That 's one thing they can count on . " " But where will you go , Zan ? " " Do n't worry about that , " Alexandra said . From her face , Sharon knew that she was thinking about men , a subject they had covered in many previous discussions but still somehow never quite summed up to their mutual satisfaction . " After a person has her debut , " Alexandra said , " she can do what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ? She canp113go where she wants , too . There 's no reason , " she said with intense , surprising bitterness , " why I have to hang around this pile of timbers . I 've had about all of it I can stand . " The telephone rang again . Sharon stared at it blankly . She looked at Alexandra for directions and , since none was forthcoming , moved her hand as if to pick up the receiver . Alexandra caught her arm . " Let it ring , " she said ; " we know what it 's for , do n't we ? " Scooping up a small bouquet ordered so she could hold it in the receiving line , she led the way out of the room. 6 OUTSIDE the Lilac Room a mild circle of light splashed downward . It came from a gas jet which was always kept burning there . At the time it was built in the late nineties the Saxe Mansion , as it was then called , had been equipped with both gas and electricity , the architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be of any permanent , practical worth . The gas had burned there when Jessica had been a girl growing up in this house and it burned there now , a mild votive offering to the past , kept as it was . Jessica liked things to stay the same , and then , too , gas was cheap. just past the circle of light , in a sudden plunge of darkness , the staircase dropped in a steep , powerful coil to the festive hall below . Around it the other rooms rose in layers , like rows of ascending balconies , four stories of bedrooms , sitting rooms and rooms for reading , games and entertainment , the grand tiers starting on the ground floor and ending in the section of artificial sky , made of imported glass , designed as a roof for the stairwell and equipped with miraculous , slowly turning galaxies of simulated stars . The staircase itself was a splendid thing . The stairs were broad , ever widening , twisting down tremendously . Upon their solid surfaceswas a rich and still handsome old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a design of gray and rose diamonds . On the inside of the stairwell , put there for ornament as well as protection , was a tulipwood banister , the top rail as thick as a railroad tie , smoothly polished , spiraling in a way that would have been perfect for sliding and had constituted a perpetual temptation to the girls when smaller , since banister-sliding had been sternly forbidden . The very soul of the house seemed to live in the stairwell , bottled up there in the central and yet empty place , a soul locatable and traceable by the huge and mysterious collection of smells which thep114stairwell held in its vast wooden clasp , where the air had not changed since the house was built and would not be changed until it was pulled clown . True , the staircase did not go all the way down to the basement ( this , and the cooking quarters , being reached by two smaller , fumed-oak staircases , put in principally for the use of the servants ) , but the basement smells found their way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the smells , you could identify the furnace smell pushing up from where , with its battery of copper boilers , flanked by bins of coal , the furnace snaked up its arms through the floor like a surrendering octopus , its fire door sparking redly  --  the octopus ' eye  --  tended day and night by a halfwittedbut sweet Polish furnaceman , Gogi , who lived , ate and slept down there in the coaly warmth . Upward also , wonderfully rich and penetrative ( though nobody , Jessica was in the habit of saying , could actually smell cooking ) , came the kitchens smells by which you knew , happily and surely , that people ate in this house , and ate well , just as you knew with a relaxing sense of comfort that the house was sure to be heated or cooled , winter or summer , at just the right temperature . In the staircase the air currents from the house mingled : from the water closets , the linen closets , pungent of cedar , from the dryness and mousy dustiness of studdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks , valises , carryalls , and hampers , many of them stamped with labels reading Grand Hotel , Shepheards Hotel , Claridge Hotel , Adlon Hotel . There were the separate , individual climates of the eighteen bedrooms , each with its characteristic atmosphere  --  theguest bedrooms scented by the shaving water and perfume and body odor of the last guests to occupy them , bland and neutral or exotic and stimulating but always acceptable as being first-class and comme it faut , as Mademoiselle , the French governess , would have said ; when doors were opened and closed there spiraled up the valiant smells of whisky and cigars and wood fires and upholstery and the chalk and leather pungence of the billiardroom , and in the mornings the smell of coffee and brass polish and the soap and water and fresh , beachy smell of wet brick when the forecourt was hosed off . The air of the staircase retained all of these wonders , smoothed them out and stripped them of identification , filing them away forever in its large , impartial , dateless tube of reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses crossed to the head of the stairs and stood looking down at a future they could n't discern while around them , unheard , gabbled the childishp115voices of their past , to be dismissed tonight  --  at least where Alexandra was involved  --  forever . One such , coming that moment into both their minds , was Pamela 's voice as she did French lessons with Mademoiselle -- a sound Alexandra and Sharon had listened to every night as they started down to supper . Sometimes Alexandra , annoyed by the cultural efforts upstairs , mocked them with wild cries , imitating the syllables Pamela was pronouncing . Now , as if able to hear again Mademoiselle 's stern command to " repetez mires moi , " she said under her breath , with a derisive air , " Pou tou mou lou ... moi loi roi choi poi ... " Sharon laughed . As always , she was there , faithful and impressed , ready to be an audience for her sister 's every whim . Alexandra got another idea . " Here , " she said , shoving the bouquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a movement of ferocious , balletlike speed and grace she jumped onto the banister rail . Folding her arms , leaning sideways to balance herself , giving warning of her descent with one loud yell , she slid down like lightning , ending with a bound that shot her ten feet past the stair end . She landed on her feet , almost in front of her angered and dumfounded parents , her adopted sister and the assembled servants . Jessica 's serene party face betrayed no trace of surprise . She chose , in this extraordinary moment , to correct her daughter 's effrontery by ignoring its effect . " Straighten your dress , dear , " she said . " You 've crumpled it be-hind . " Alexandra gave a pull to her skirt . She started to say something to her mother , but at that moment the doorbell rang and Temple , showing a composure equal to his mistress ' , stepped forward to open the door . Sharon ran down the last part of the staircase . She handed Alexandra her bouquet , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first guests , having yielded up their outer clothing to the housemaid , stepped forward to be received . The guests were Mr. and Mrs. T. W. Wilkins , Sr. , he looking every inch a proper bank president , she trying to compensate for social lacks by anxious bunched diamonds and a toothy smile . The night was dark , windy and damp . Little puffs of fog came in each time the front door was opened . In the middle of California Street , east of the house , a policeman diverted traffic so that the line of limousines and taxis inching along the right-hand side of the street could have a clear passage into the courtyard . Soon thep116downstairs hall became crowded with formally dressed people , young and old , fathers and mothers , and in some cases grandparents of debutantes having been invited , along with younger brothers and sisters , waiting their turn to pass down the receiving line . Temple called out the names of arrivals in a voice like that of an auctioneer . The party had begun . IT WAS just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding down the banister . Even if the show was designed for her , she still had to pull off some trick like that . Also she had on make-up . Pamela had known she would have . No matter how beautiful you were , you were n't beautiful enough if you were Alexandra ; you had to be crazy too ; no matter how much money your parents were spending , you had to try harder to please , with smiles , with pressures of the hand , blown kisses , loving publicly even people you did n't like , and of course men , all men ; you had to try , and try harder , than girls whose parents never spent a cent and who , themselves , did n't have a chance . It was stupid . What made it all the stupider was that it was so dated . Alexandra insisted on being dated , old hat , to use one of her own expressions . She wanted to model herself on the girls they 'd read about in books when they were younger : Iris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun Also Rises . They had been forbidden to read the books just as they were forbidden now to put on make-up and to drink liquor , although Alexandra drank , too . That was another thing Pamela knew , although she 'd never tell anybody . Alexandra kept bourbon on her dressing table in a big bottle that had once held Nuit de Noel . She also drank with men who brought flasks , in the dated way Alexandra thought was so smart , for girls who were too young to drink at the bar . Poor Alexandra , wonderful , breath-taking Alexandra , whose one passion was to be ahead of everyone , to be the mode , the rage , mascaraed and all , page-boy bob and all , she who as a little girl had twisted her long blond hair up in curls and ringlets and spitty little ear-puff dabs in imitation of Vilma Banky and Greta Garbo and Olga Baclanova . All so gauche , that was the tragedy of it , at least a tragedy for Alexandra , whose favorite word was gauche , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandra in the receiving line , Pamela could n't help stealing little looks at her half-sister instead of keeping her eyesp117straight ahead as Jessica had told her to do when they rehearsed all this . They had stood here , lined up the day before , all three of them , while Jessica , acting the part of different guests , young and old , men and women , passed down the line schooling them in the right how-do-you-dos  --  the right smiles , the pressures of the hand , the way of accepting compliments , if they were offered , the warm look of the eyes and the so-glad-you-could-come turn of the softly parted lips . No handshakes , girls ; handshakes are gauche . Just allow your fingers to rest in the man 's . ( Pamela , of course , never could help giving a handshake if someone shook hands with her , but that she was powerless to fix . ) The trouble was that she was scared . Not so much now as she had been , but still a little scared by force of habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 'd been scared , and it had lasted from then on . Jessica had noticed it . She noticed everything . She kept hying to reassure Pamela that everything was going to be all right . Pamela could live here always . No one could take her away . She could share and share alike . Absolutely equal  --  her own room , her own dresses , her own governess , her own napkin ring . You must realize , dear child , that the sad experiences you have known in the past are all over and will never come back . We wo n't ever talk about them and we will try to stop thinking about them , wo n't we ? This is our home now . All the kindness and the big rooms , the little bunch of violets in the vase in the Pierce Arrow limousine in which Alfred drove them all to Miss Burke 's , his red ears sticking out like handles on each side of his chauffeur 's cap . All for her and she must n't be scared  --  although what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bones was that they 'd find out that she did n't like it . Then they would hate her for sure ; she would be disgraced . They must never find out . Day and night she had to live with the fear that they would find out and at the same time the longing to tell them , to yell it at them . All the awfulness is gone now , dear , and it will never , never come back . Why would it never come back ? Was the world so horrible you could n't even have a hope that the awfulness , as they called it , would come back , since it had been so wonderful ? You were n't supposed to talk about your mother or think about her , but the truth was Pamela had loved her vague , sweet , boozy mother and there had n't been a minute of it that had been awful except the worm that had crawled out of the piece of penny candy that had been her birthday present when she was three and they had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colored man ,  |p118had  taken her fishing in the bay and called her missy . Where was Livey now , if she could see him , hear his easy , sliding voice just for one minute , see the pale quiet insides of his hands as he baited up the hook with a piece of shrimp so she could catch a bullhead ? None of it anything but wonderful or anything but what she wanted and had to get back somehow and find her mother again . What had happened , what had gone wrong ? None of it awful , even the two sailors fighting in the bar that time and her mother crying and then talking so sweetly to the cop about her baby that he 'd let her go and had only pinched the sailors , and the time her mother could n't wait and had to go on the floor of the taxicab . That was bad because you were supposed to find the popo no matter how badly you wanted to go , and her mother teaching her five foot two eyes of blue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bars would throw nickels quarters and even fourbit pieces at her because there had to be some way to eat and a threeyearold kid with such talent was wonderful , had a fine future before her . The cough . It had all gone wrong because of the cough and finally the spattering bright plume of blood across the pillow , the mattress and onto the floor and the taxicab always taxicabs and her mother talking to the driver the way she knew so they would n't have to pay and the drive through the rainy Oregon night to the place where they 'd made her so comfortable and she 'd shivered all night with the first absolute desperate hopelessness of her life knowingher mother would n't be there in the morning and , sure enough , she had n't been . Instead , a few days later , Jessica had come . Lying in bed in the California Street house with the door open in a crack into Mademoiselle 's room and a little light showing becausenow she was afraid in the dark , Pamela reasoned it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the turned-up nose aimed at the ceiling . People got over coughs eventually , no matter how bad ; there had been a misunderstanding somewhere along the line and she had to do something about it . One day she did . She 'd saved up her allowance , fifty cents a week , the amount set at this figure because Alexandra , who was six months younger , also got this amount . It was even Stephen and share alike , just as Jessica had said . She saved up and when she had twelve dollars she packed . The only thing she wanted to take was Dixie , the parakeet they 'd given her . She hated dolls ; always had . She got one of Mademoiselle 's shoeboxes and cut a hole in it because a bird had to breathe and tied a string around it and bought a bus ticket to Eugene , Oregon . She was seven years old and it hadp119been three years since she had been there , but the lady in the home remembered her perfectly . The lady was so sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the least idea where she had gone . Pamela still had two dollars left . She planned to go on looking in the morning but she was pretty tired . She had the same bed again , and she put the box with the bird in it on a small shelf right beside her . This time Anchylus was the one who came to get her . She had never liked him . She knew he was her father . She had heard her mother say so , both to her and to the lady in the place . It made very little difference that he was her father ; she had n't liked him even as much as she liked Jessica . Now he was nicer . He drove all over town with her , looking for a place to buy seed for Dixie ; then he took her home on the train . He was large , pale , tired and discouraged ; she had n't ever thought anything could get him down ; his voice was just as raspy , but she knew with a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run away and she felt sorry for him . She knew that in his eyes she had done a bad thing and she wanted to make up to him for this . She had kept this in mind ever since , reminding herself to feel sorry for him , and they had got along all right . " Congratulations , Pamela dear . You look truly lovely . " " Thank you , Miss Meeker . I 'm so glad you could come . " Letty Meeker twinkled at her and passed on into the ballroom with a whiff of lavenderish five-and-dime-store perfume and a glint of nameless , worthless little jewels . Pamela turned to greet Mr. and Mrs. Oakleigh Donovan , who were followed by their daughter , Gertrude , and Gertrude 's escort , Timmy Wilkins , Jr. ; Timmy was especially smiling and beguiling because he was moping for Alexandra , whom he had taken to all the parties that summer in Atherton , where the Saxes had their summer place , but who had recently dropped him , along with all her other beaux , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Save me a gavotte , Pam , " Timmy said . " You bet , " Pamela said . She knew he would never dance with her . That kind of fellow never did . She did n't care . There were always fellows that would . It was share and share alike ; and if she suffered by comparison , it was only by comparison to Alexandra , by comparison with whom anybody suffered . Certainly she was at least as attractive as Sharon , with her straight black hair , suspicious glare and body like an ironingboard . All debutantes at their own debuts were beautiful , justp120as all brides were beautiful . " The three beautiful Saxe sisters , " Letty Meeker would say in her report the next day , " received with their parents at a ball given in their own house , wearing identical dresses of . . . " and so on . Letty in the course of years had put out enough reporting on herself and Alexandra and Sharon to make a series like the Five Little Peppers : The Saxe Sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Saxe Sisters in a Submarine , The Saxe Sisters on a Cloud . And talk about being scared , Jessica and the girls seemed to be scared of Letty because she would take digs at anybody , and Anchylus let her say anything she wanted to . " Hello , Pamela dear . " " How do you do , Mrs. Tewcomby , Mr. Tewcomby . " " You look most charming , dear . " " Thank you so much , Mrs. Tewcomby , Mr. Tewcomby . " Arrivals were thinning out . Alexandra had already asked her mother for permission to dance  --  trying to steal the show again . Pamela determined to stick it out . She was not competing with anyone , but if they wanted her to have a debut she would have one , she would do her best . The debut was part of the deal but afterwardshe 'd have to see . Maybe now she was caught up for letting go of the dearly recalled awfulness of her life with her mother . Maybe now they 'd let her have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few girls had done it , girls known to the Saxes ; some even had to do it , due to the Depression . Maybe she could still find a little Depression around somewhere to give her an excuse. " ... and my sister Pamela , Prince Shimenko ... " " How do you do , Prince Shimenko , " Pamela said . Prince Shimenko kissed her hand . God knew where Alexandra had picked this one up , a thin little man with a long nose and black eyebrows , wearing a black-tie suit that did n't fit . Alexandra was mad about men with titles , another proof of the Old Hat way she looked at things . The receiving line had finally disintegrated and Pamela found herself dancing with Prince Shimenko , listening to the spiel he was giving her about the estates his family had owned in Russia . As he talked she got the impression , she did n't know why , that he was scared to death , as she had once been , and accordingly the **26;1339;TOOLONG business began aggravating her . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said when he ran out of material . " What , my dear gorl ? " the Prince said , pulling back and gapingp121at her with the monocle that was always falling out of his eye . " I think you 're very nice , but I think you 're a hell of a liar . " The Prince beamed . His slimness , she saw , was only in part due to sickliness . He was really quite young , for an older man . " My dear gorl , I am nod . But what difference does it make ? " Seizing her happily in his arms , he whirled her away at a fast , awkward clip , kicking up his heels on the turns. 8 THE DANCING was at its height . Vibrations of music and the rhythmed pressure of dancing feet ran through the whole house and were felt even in the cellar , where Gogi , who had refused out of shyness to come up and see the sights , sat on his stool with the fire door open in front of him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a great occasion , and Griff Williams and the boys were rising to it with sweet Guy Lombardo harmonies and crashing social Leo Reisman piano effects . Griff and the boys were out for blood , playing their first big house date after a long dry stretch . The beat , beat , beat of the tomtom and the sweet tenor sax blowing and drumming away the Depression mists , wiping away lonesome boarding-house nights , wino breath of little bars where the boys had passed the time when there were not only no house dates for society parties but no dates at all , everyone split up , playing in little combos around the city in order to eat . You 're the top , they played , you 're the Colt repeater , be still my heart . The object of my affection can change my complexion from white to stuff and stuff . You ought to be in pictures , you 're the top , you 've had a busy day . Bright and breezy on the bandstand in the Nob Hill home , they blew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a red dress , dead in the alley back of a Chicago theater , for Kurt von Schleicher , shot in the back , for Primo Carnera , kayoed by Max Schmeling . A hurray for Dizzy and Daffy , for the upswing , for the long gray Roosevelt freight ride out of trouble . I know that if I even took one whiff it would bore me terrif-icly too but I get a kick out of you , blew Griff Williams . Love thy neighbor , Ginger Rogers , Papa Dionne , Albert Einstein , Carole Lombard , Bruno Richard Hauptmann , Al Capone . You 're the top . You 're the Eiffel Tower . Stay as sweet as you are . It 's love in bloom . Each time Alexandra turned to a new partner , she put her soft , accessible body completely against him , giving up to him , adapting herself effortlessly to his style of dancing , sometimes only for a stepp122or two , since there was always someone else waiting to cut in . " Bye , " she said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command to dance with her again as soon as possible ; then she moved away , holding her arms up to settle them around a new dancer . Can it be the breeze That fills the treesWith rare and magic perfume ? Anchylus , standing with Jessica , his craggy face beaming with pleasure , watched the success of his three girls , all so good looking , the blonde , the brunette , and the red-haired one , the girls in their bright dresses moving with so many others in a haze of tulle and silk and warm , perfumed young flesh around the island of black cloth in the center of the room that was the stag line . Oh , no , it is n't the breezeWhen Alexandra and Pamela were on the floor , the debut had becomeofficial . Yet people hardly noticed whether Pamela was there or not . Alexandra 's presence was the only one that meant anything ; in it generated a force that changed the mood and even the architectureof the party . The stag line was pulled lopsided by the fellows bunching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just cut in on , one cutting in , others waiting to cut in . You could never tell about a girl , no matter how beautiful she was , until she had made her debut . Now Alexandra was proved up . " She 's a real belle , my dear , " the older people said to Jessica and Anchylus . At approximately thirty minutes before one , the hour at which supper was to be served , Alexandra walked out of the room alone . She walked through the press of maids and catering butlers in the pantry . Holding her dress away from her legs , she ran up the small stairway connecting the pantry with the servants ' rooms and certain small , rarely used guestrooms . A few minutes later Schuyler Cutting , a young dancing man , reputed to have money , also left the ballroom . He stopped under the constellations in the hall long enough to light a cigarette and get his bearings . Here he chatted with an elderly dowager who insisted on detaining him to make comments on the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He had been her partner oftener than anyone else , and when he was dancing with her she sometimes refused to let others cut in. )  | " Everyone is talking about it , mon Cher , " the dowager said , tapping him on the chest with her fan , " everyone . What a belle ! " " Thank you , Madame , " Schuyler Cutting said . " But where is your dear mother ? I have n't seen her all evening . " " Ah , you know Mother , " the young man said . " She 's probably playing cards .... Please excuse me . " He went on up the stairs . On the third floor he stood still once more , counting the doors stretching away on the right side of the stairhead ; picking out one which had been described to him , he went toward it lightly and quickly , his rather dull , white , heavy face , young and vain , quiet as a hunter 's . He tried the knob , the door opened , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no delay , a girl 's body , soft , perfumed and expectant , light as air and also mysteriously heavy , settled against him , drawing on his with a rhythm that seemed born in it , while an eager , exploring mouth made his brains spin around . " You took your dress off , " he said rather stupidly . The private little noise that she was making in her throat broke off , and from this throat now came a voice not at all like the voice used in flirtation , harsh in the small , darkened room . " Do n't talk , " she said , " we have n't got much time . " 9 IT HAD BEEN understood that Sharon was not to stay up for the whole party . There would be time enough for that when she made her own debut . For the present she was younger and would have to go to bed a little early , even if the party was still going on . Griff Williams had been hired to play until four o'clock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer if there was a demand for encores , as there was sure to be . At a private ball an orchestra could n't pour the spit out of the horns and pack up the drums and vamoose at the stroke of an hour , like a union band playinga lodge picnic . Also , even when Griff and the boys had gone , there were always a few guests who could play piano  --  Devereux Sansome , for one . So with one thing and another , plus scrambled eggs and bacon for those who wanted them , it might be six or seven in the morning before everything was over . Long before that time younger brothers and sisters and the old people and fathers and mothers would be in bed . The hours between the end of supper and the onset of daylight belonged to the debutantes and their partners . Other people be/longed in two categories  --  those who 'd had their chance at this sort of thing and those who would have it in due course . Sharon had said all right , if Jessica insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes off and lie down but she would n't sleep . She did n't know anyone who could , with a party going on in her own home . To her own surprise she went to sleep right away . She woke up an hour later because Alexandra was sitting on the bed and had turned on the bed light . Instead of her ball dress Alexandra had on a woolen suit with a fur coat over it . There was a valise on the floor beside her . She had two letters in her hand . " Chicken , " she said , " I 'm sorry about waking you up , but you have to do something for me . " Sharon sat up with a jerk . " What , Zan ? " she said . " What 's going on ? " " Nothing , " Alexandra said , " except that I 'm eloping with SchuylerCutting . We 're flying up to Reno . Schuy has a friend who owns a plane . So wish me good luck . " " I want to go too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alexandra said , " but it 's absolutely impossible . We 're not taking anyone or telling anyone . You 're the only living human being that knows . So I 've kept my word about telling you but you ca n't come with us . That 's out . " Sharon began to cry . " Please , Chicken , " Alexandra said . " Do n't start that . " " I 'm going to miss you something awful , Zan , " Sharon said . " I 'll miss you too , " Alexandra said , " but I 'm not going away forever , you know . I 'll be back and we 'll be together as much as ever . I promise . " " No , we wo n't , " Sharon said . She dabbed at her eyes , shaking with large , dry sobs . " You ca n't fool me . You are going away forever . I hate Schuyler Cutting . " A flood of tears now poured down her face . She wiped them away with the sheet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She spoke with great conviction  --  a conviction that welled up from the sleeping depths in which she had just been plunged and which took possession of her whole mind and body . Nor was she ever quite convinced later that she had not been right , at least in part . Alexandra 's elopement might not have been the end of everything but it was certainly the beginning of a lot of things nobody had anticipated.  | " Shar , I want you to stop that nonsense and pay attention to me , " Alexandra said in a voice a good deal like Jessica 's . " There 's something you have to do . I want you to take charge of these letters and see each one gets to the person it 's addressed to . " Sharon looked miserably at the letters . On the envelope of each a name had been written in the square , ornamental handwriting that all girls learned to write at Miss Burke 's , with little circles used instead of periods and dots over the i 's . The names wereMr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , Zan , " Sharon said , " I ca n't go out now and trail all over town looking for two men . Mother would give me hell . " " You do n't have to go out , " Alexandra said ; " that 's the point of it . They 're both downstairs dancing . " " They are ? " Sharon said with amazement . " I thought the party was all over . " " Well , it 's not , " Alexandra said ; " it 's not even four o'clock yet . As a matter of fact . I do n't want you to go down this minute . Wait a half an hour so that Schuy and I can get going . We do n't want anybody chasing us . . . . Well , will you do it for me ? " " All right , Zan , " Sharon said . She had stopped crying . Suddenly she wrapped her skinny arms around her sister , clasping her in a hug of murderous power . " Zan , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now it was Alexandra who began to cry . " Angel ! Chicken ! I 'm doing it because . . . But it does n't matter . It 's all settled , do n't you see ? Now look what you 've done . You 've made my mascara run . ... Goodbye . Kiss me . " " Zan ! I wish  --  " " I do too , but it ca n't be helped . And I love you too . All right , once more . . . and wish me luck .... " " I do , Zan , " Sharon said meekly . " Tell Mother I 'll telephone her sometime tomorrow  --  today , I mean . But do n't tell anybody where we 're going . You 're the only one that knows . Goodbye . " " Goodbye , Zan . Oh ... " " Goodbye . I 'll talk to you too , when I talk to Mother . And do n't forget the letters . " Alexandra took a tissue and a lipstick from her purse . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mouthp126and removed the smudges around her eyes . She smiled brilliantly at Sharon , picked up her valise and left the room . FOR SOME MINUTES Sharon sat huddled on the bed . She felt wide-awake and yet exhausted . She had a temptation to close her eyes for a few seconds , except that doing so might make her break her promise to Alexandra . She felt that a whole world , everything she 'd lived by till that moment , had come crashingaround her , and there was no chance , no chance at all , for happiness any more  --  and all of this was terrible beyond words , yet exciting , and some good might come out of it . It was really time to get up and dress , if she was to go down with the letters , but she had no strength to do it yet , and while she waited for strength to come back she examined the letters themselves . Suddenly she was overcomewith curiosity . She would have given anything for a look insideone of them ; if Alexandra minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and besides , if she herself was going to deliver letters , she had some right to know what was in them . She turned them over , studying the flaps . The letter to Tim Wilkins was very tightly sealed , but the one to Bradley Iverson was loose at one end , and by working her finger in the gap Sharon got it open withoutmuch damage . The letter said : DEAR BRAD : You were an angel to ask me to marry you , but after giving this most careful thought , dear Brad , I have decided against it . I am leaving tonight to marry Schuyler Cutting , with whom I am very much in love . I hope you can understand and forgive this decision to which I have given most careful thought , and that we can still continue to be friends . I am having this letter delivered to you personally , dear Brad , because I want you to be the first one to know . So , wish me luck , dear , if you can , and thanks for everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flap and stuck it down with spit . She held the other letter up to the light . She could n't make out more than a word here and there but even so she was convinced its phrasingp127was identical with the first . Alexandra was not a person for finesse in minor matters , particularly when she was in a hurry . After all , would two gentlemen , even if they shared a mutual reverse of fortune , compare notes ? At least she , Sharon , had found out one interesting fact  --  that Brad had asked Alexandra to marry him . Probably Tim had too . Else why would Alexandra be writing to him ? And having the letter delivered at the very moment of elope-ment ? Alexandra had always been secretive about some matters . She had talked freely about men in general and matters pertaining to men in general rather than about her relationship to any particular men , even though such relationships were in some mysterious way the essence of her life . Outwardly she had preserved the proper decorum of a girl not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposedly , not having taken place until tonight . She had worn the middy blouses , the black ties , white collars and the black shoes , she had patted a ball around the tennis court and ridden , in the summers , on group rides on the trails around Atherton , but all the time she had presided like the legitimate pretender to a disputedthrone , in exile but planning a coronation . Sharon had no idea how she had managed it , though possibly it had n't taken too much management ; men had swarmed about Alexandra since she had turned twelve , and not always the sort of men she was supposed to play with . Once , for instance , she had confessed to Sharon quite lightheartedly that on several occasions , left alone with Albert , the chauffeur , she had necked with him in the front seat . Sharon found it impossible to visualize this . All she could bring before her mind was Albert 's handle-shaped ears sticking out on each side of his cap as he drove the three of them to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a realm apart from the private , little-girl world she 'd shared with Sharon , that cozy upstairs alliance of the two of them against all others  --  Jessica , Anchylus , the governesses , and of course Pamela . Their own world  --  only a fraction of Alexandra 's , but Sharon 's all . Now , all in a second , with a wave of goodbye and a smile , as it were , that world was gone . There was nothing in its place . But was there really nothing ? Sharon kept looking at the letters . Out of all the men who 'd wanted her , Alexandra had chosen one . She 'd gone away with him . She 'd left all the rest . She 'd turned them loose . Now it was no longer hopeless to wish to be beautiful , hopelessbecause Alexandra was so much more beautiful than she , Sharon ,  |p128could  ever be . Now she had a chance . Even these men to whom the letters were addressed , these might like her since they had liked Alexandraand she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of them , " Sharon said to herself , entranced and almost consoled by the thought , " why not one of them for me ? " ' Which ? It did n't really matter , just so long as there was someone to fill the void left by Alexandra 's going . As she dressed , Sharon evaluated the persons designated by the names on the letters : the friendly , athletic , rather dull but so goodlookingTim Wilkins , " their sort " of person and of course possibly and in fact likely to succeed his father in Pacific Midland ; and Brad Iverson , a little older , but also probably smarter since he was a writer and a good one , people said  --  he had once even worked for The Day . Thinking about them as she brushed her hair and got her feet , which seemed to have become enlarged while she slept , back into her dancing slippers , Sharon decided they were both fascinating . She did n't see how Alexandra could leave either of them or how she could have turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they had both proposed . Either of them , she thought , would do in a pinch . Either of them  --  and the one who got to know her would find out it was worth while . She would n't treat them the way Alexandra had . To her , a man was n't something to be picked up or laid down the way Alexandra picked people up and laid them down . Only a person as wonderful as Alexandra and as glamorous and all could get away with that . She herself would never want to . Alexandra could have told the fellows her sister would be with them . If she 'd wanted to put something helpful in the letters she could have said it quite simply . DEAR TIM OR BRAD as the case might be : I am sending you this goodbye letter by my sister , Sharon , who is also my best friend . I suggest that you look her over carefully since there is more to her than meets the eye . She has an affectionate nature , can keep secrets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going away she needs someone to love and I 'm sure you 'll find that she 'll do very well . Obviouslyshe is n't as good looking as I am , but remember , she is a year younger and there is a good chance she may improve . Hoping you will give this matter most careful thought , I am , etc. , etc . ALEXANDRA SAXEp129Sharon wondered whether there was any way , as she handed the two men the letters , she could plant such thoughts in their minds . Probably not , but at least the mail delivery would be an opening of a sort . Possibly one of the recipients , if not too stricken by the news in the envelope , might ask her to dance . Tonight neither of the two concerned had asked her , at least not yet . Once more repeating the route she had taken earlier , in such a different frame of mind , she started down the stairs . In the hall she could feel the music , and as soon as she reached the stair landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's great mingled gabble of voices . You make time and you make love dandy You make swell molasses candyBut honey are you making any money That 's all I want to knowThere was quite a press of people in the hall , a good many of them leaving . Sharon wondered whether Alexandra 's absence had been noted and whether she herself , by mooning upstairs , had let more time pass than she should have . It would be terrible if the men who were to get the news of Zan 's elopement should have gone . With an anxious , disturbed look on her face she hurried toward the crowd below , carrying the letters pressed against her chest . TIM WILKINS was a good sport . He read the letter , put it inhis pocket , drank another glass of champagne , and wenthome . He had an air of feeling that the announced elopementmight have been all for the best . Brad Iverson seemed far more upset . He stayed long after all the other guests had left . At half past seven he refused a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making calls to various hotels in Reno and the Lake Tahoe area to find out whether a Mr. and Mrs. Schuyler Cutting were registered . " Be the first to congratulate them , " he said . " Horrible thing to do , is n't it ? Classic behavior of the jilted suitor . Be the very first and make ' em hate you forever after . " " You really should try to relax , Brad , " Jessica said . " You ought to go and get some rest . " Brad finally accepted this advice . He was putting on his overcoatp130and silk top hat in the hall when there occurred a tremendous ringing of the front door bell followed by indications that someone was pounding on the door with his fists and kicking it with his feet . The servants had all gone up and the caterer 's men had left with their van of equipment , so Jessica , who never went to bed as long as there were still guests in her house , opened the door herself and Letty Meeker walked in . Letty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't been sleeping . Her face was a greenish color and she was very angry . She had with her an AP flimsy which she thrust toward Jessica . " You knew about this . You knew , did n't you ? " " I ca n't read it , Letty , if you keep waving it around . " " Alexandra  --  she was married at six A.M. this morning by a Justice of the Peace in Reno . It 's all right here ! " Jessica had taken the report . She was starting to read it when Letty snatched it out of her hand . She crumpled it and threw it on the floor . " You knew she was eloping and you never told me . Why ? " " Letty , " Jessica said , " if you wish to remain in my house you will refrain from addressing me in that belligerent tone . " " I want to know why I was n't told . " " You were n't told because nobody knew . This came as a surprise to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They put the story out , and now everybody 's got it . " " I imagine it went through the regular channels , do n't you ? A marriage is a matter of public record . " " Everyone has it now , " Letty said unreasonably , still furious , " and it should have been my exclusive . If I ever had a right to an exclusiveit 's for stories emanating from this house . I do n't believe Mr. Saxe was told of this . I do n't think for a minute he would condoneputting every other paper in town ahead of me with my own exclusive . " " You can ask Mr. Saxe about that yourself , Letty , " Jessica said . " He will be at his office sometime today . And now , since you refuse to conform to a tone of courtesy or even ordinary civility  --  " " You 'll be sorry for this , Jessica , " Letty said . " Alexandra will be sorry for it too . " " ... I must ask you to leave my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to say how happy she is , " Lettysaid , " tell her , Letty Meeker says you will be sorry for this . ' " She picked up the crumpled flimsy from the hall carpet and trottedp131out the front door , her small , underslung butt wagging viciously . " Well , " Brad said , " what got into her ? " These were the first human-sounding , un-sorry-for-himself words he had spoken for nearly six hours . Jessica looked very tired . " Letty is a coarse , ill-tempered woman , " she said ; " I 've known it for some time . She writes well , but she tries to arrogate an importance which her position on The Day by no means warrants . I believe Mr. Saxe might do well to ask for her resignation . Now , we 'd all better go to bed . No doubt we 'll be hearing from Alexandra and Schuyler a little later . " Sharon followed Brad outside into the court . The sun was high now and the bricks in front of the house glowed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wet with the mists of the vanished night , came a fresh , soapy smell . Traffic was stirring on California Street and the harbor at the bottom of the hill was wrapped in a gold-shot , glinting haze . Standing on the front doorstep , Sharon noticed that her head was on a level with Brad Iverson 's . She reached out her round , thin , girlish arms and settled them around his neck . " I think Zan was an idiot to marry Schuy , " she said . So saying , she kissed Brad Iverson on the mouth.  |p135ANCHYLUS  had never been able to figure it out . He had tried todo so repeatedly and he tried once more , alone in his office theday Jessica died , looking back over their life together . Alexandra might have been a little too good-looking for her own good , perhaps also a little wild , but she had always seemed so basically sensible . Then , just to pack up and run off with a fellow she hardly knew and who had none too sweet a reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to get the hang of it . Jessica might have come near the truth when she said , " I 'm afraid we may as well face it . She did n't love this Schuyler Cutting . He was merely a means to an end . She wanted to leave . " Anchylus had opposed this idea . To believe it was to accept the very implication which hurt most about Alexandra 's elopement  --  that he and Jessica , in spite of all they had done , had failed to seal up the crack in the family structure . Once he had tried to verify Jessica 's theory by checking it with Sharon . " Do you think Zan had any other reason for going , other than a yen to marry this guy ? "  | " I do n't know , Anchy , " Sharon said . Anchylus looked at her sternly . Even the fact that she had called him " Anchy " instead of " Dad " seemed a little irritating at this juncture ; yet , oddly enough , neither Sharon nor Alexandra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar parental diminutives which proper children were supposed to use . Pamela was the only one who called him Dad . She had begun it when they were alone together up in Oregon , that time when she 'd run away and he 'd gone up there to bring her home . " I just thought you might have some idea , " he had said to Sharon ; " you and she were pretty close . Did n't she ever talk to you about what she was going to do ? " " Not really , " Sharon said , " but I do n't think she was too insane about him , if that 's what you mean . " " Your mother does n't think so , either . " Sharon reached for a phrase . " Zan wanted to be on her own , " she said . On her own ! It was the very phrase which Pamela , in quite a differentsort of conversation , had used not long afterward when she 'd said that she was going to take a job . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she did n't have to go about it just that way . She could have asked to have a wedding . " " If she had , " Sharon said , " would you and Mother have given her one ? " " Of course , " Anchylus said , " of course we 'd have given her one . We 'd have loved it . " He 'd spoken with complete conviction . Yet hardly two years later when Sharon , trusting him , had asked for a wedding on her own account , he 'd tried to dissuade her from marrying at all ! When had that been ? Anchylus , who had the habit of identifying dates by headlines , let one zoom in at him : HAVENNER WINS ! He chuckled . That was one he 'd written himself , deliberately leavingto the lower deck all mention of a gentleman who had just been re-elected President of the United States by the greatest majority in history , carrying forty-six out of forty-eight states . Anchylus was rather proud of the headline and had justified himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an eastern snob whereas Frank Havenner , a longtime supervisor , meant something to San Franciscans , who would like hearing that he 'd been elected top137Congress . Secretly , he 'd been rather pleased when Time pointed out that , as an example of home-angled news , his slug on the election bore comparison with The Boston Transcript 's famous reportage on the sinking of the S. S. Titanic a generation earlier , with the loss of 1,513 passengers and crewmen . The Transcript , so legend had it , slugged its account of the disaster : BOSTON WOMAN LOST AT SEAAlone with his ghosts , he tried to remember how Letty Meeker had headed her story on Sharon 's wedding . NOTABLE NAMES UNITED . . . Letty could be pretty dull , especially when she was trying to be respectful . Letty was never reluctant about taking potshots at Alexandra  --  she 'd never forgiven her for ruining , by eloping , The Day 's exclusive on the debut . However , as if to make up for her ill treatment of one sister by her devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriousness that approached the ridiculous . . . . IN SOLEMN CATHEDRAL RITESBradley Whyte Iverson was not , by any standard known to anybody , a notable name . He was a professor 's son whose mother had some money and whose younger sister had come out the same year as Pam and Alexandra . A rather homely younger sister , as Anchylus remembered her  --  her homeliness , naturally regrettable , being doublyunfortunate in this case since if she 'd been more of a belle her older brother might not have been sent along to see she was n't stuck for a partner at the parties she went to . If that sister , damn it all , had just been a little lovelier , Brad Iverson might never have met either Sharon or , before her , Alexandra . Still , even with a homely sister to look after , a man thirty years old had no business at debutante balls , and one who was thirty-two had even less marrying a girl of eighteen . That was how Anchylus felt and that was what he had said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think his real objection had been that Brad , like himself , was a newspaperman ; Sharon insisted that it had been , but Sharon had been wrong . He , Anchylus , knew something about newspapermen and even more about Brad Iverson , since he 'd employed him for three years  --  started him off , as a matter of fact , a green kid with a brandnewdiploma from the University of California.  |p138Oh  , Brad was bright . You could n't gainsay that . He could also write , and had proved it to an uncomfortably large audience , but Anchylus still had n't changed his opinion that Brad was the sort of newspaperman who was always brighter personally than the copy he wrote and always more political personally than the paper 's politics and always bigger in his own estimation than any newspaper or chain of newspapers , no matter how important , that he happened to be working for . Well , so much for the notable names . As for the " solemn rites , " Anchylus supposed they 'd been solemn if by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly more than was good for them and a set of bridesmaids who looked ravishing in their white silk dresses and big June hats and a number of formally attired people who stood up with a tidal rustle as the slim , dark bride came down the center aisle of Grace Cathedral on her father 's arm . Afterward he and Jessica had put on a bang-up reception at the California Street house , just as he 'd told Sharon they would have done for Alexandra . At going-away time the forecourt had been full of howling guests assembledthere to pelt the happy couple with rice . Sharon , very handsomein her blue wool traveling suit  --  she certainly had filled out a lot , just as her mother had said she would  --  stood on the running board of the Chrysler coupe Anchylus had given her for a wedding present and tossed her bouquet back toward the steps . It had landed squarely in the arms of Pamela. 2 SHARON HAD been very glad to have the wedding , especially since it had seemed so likely for a while that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by surprise . She could have pretty well conceived , if he was going to object , that he 'd use the argument about Brad 's age , silly as this was , but she 'd never imagined he 'd come up with anything as corny as suggesting that she take a trip to Europe . " I do n't want to go to Europe , " she said ; " I want to stay in San Francisco , or right near it , and I want to marry Brad . " " If you like San Francisco so much , " Anchylus said rather truculently , " why do n't you marry a man who writes in San Francisco ? I hear Brad 's going to work in Los Angeles . " He could n't have put more venom into the words . " It 's a promotion for him , Father , " Sharon said . " He 'll be bureaup139head there . Los Angeles is one of Hurd-Hudner 's most important bureaus . " " Hurd-Hudnerl " Anchylus said . " Yes , Anchy , " Sharon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . and what 's wrong with that ? " " Well , Daughter , " Anchylus said , " Hurd-Hudner is . . . well , it 's a chain . There 's a place for chains all right , as Mr. Hearst went out and showed us , but I 'll be damned if I think . . . " He fell silent , chewing on the stem of his pipe . " Yes , Father ? " Sharon said . " I do n't think you can compare that sort of circulation with the sort of circulation we 've built up for The Day ! " " Ha ! " Sharon said . " Now it comes out ! " Her eyes flashed . She had never spoken to Anchylus in just this way before . " I understand ! " she said . " You understand what ? " " Why you 've got it in for Brad . You just ca n't stand remembering Brad left The Day to work for somebody else . " She could tell that this shot had struck home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a henchman who had changed sides . It also occurred to her that , combined with his dislike of all chain-operated newspapers , he particularly disliked HurdHudnerbecause in the depth of the Depression there had been some talk that Hurd-Hudner wanted to buy The Day , thus adding a San Francisco outlet to their sprawling newspaper empire . " If he can better himself , " he said , " I 'm the last man to hold him back . " " Well , he has bettered himself , " Sharon said . " They 're talking about giving him a column . If they do , he 'll be more than just someone who has bettered himself . He 'll be nationally known . " Anchylus shook out his pipe . " Will that make him a better newspaperman ? " he asked . Sharon took a long breath . The time had come to be a little tactful . " He 's getting better all the time , " she said . " After all , look where he got his start . " She went on with an air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because he works for Hurd-Hudner he does n't know how much he owes you , Anchy . Deep in his heart I think he 's sorry he ever left The Day . " This last statement had been pure fabrication but good strategy  --  Sharon always looked back on it with pride . She knew it had gotten her the wedding.  |p140HER  EXILE in Los Angeles had n't lasted long  --  less than two years . During this period , Brad 's rise had been more than satisfactory ; it had been sensational . With all modesty , Sharon knew she had been a help . It was important for Brad to live nicely and do some entertaining and as yet his salary by itself was n't enough to permit all this on the scale he wanted  --  and that he felt was suitable . She 'd worked hard on the entertaining and  --  why deny it ?  --  the money she 'd been able to contribute to the household budget had made life agreeable as Brad advanced toward his goals . Jessica Saxe had fallen into the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of common stock in The Day  --  a gift of which the value had steadily increased . Now the dividends constituteda nice addition to the Iverson family picture , a fact as pleasingto Sharon as it was useful to Brad . Yes , she had been proud of her ability to help , proud of her ambitions for him  --  a man so much older and so brilliant that most girls her age might have thought him entirely out of reach . He was by far the more attractive of the men to whom she had carried Alexandra 's goodbye letters on the night of the debut . This decision  --  that he was so much , much more attractivethan Tim Wilkins  --  she had made that very night and she had acted on it . It had been a long campaign , but in the end she had attracted him and , what was important , had landed him . Pride and ambition ! These were expediters of success which any loyal wife offered as a matter of course . If sometimes she bored Brad with her questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt that the information she thus obtained sharpened her judgment , fitting her to give advice and stimulation when he needed them . And what man did n't need them ! Sharon never felt more of a woman , more of a real person , than when Brad built a couple of highballs and said in his offhand way , " Kiddo , sit down a minute . There 's something I 'd like to kick around with you .... " Entertaining was one of the principal directions in which she could help  --  the sort of entertaining that was geared to a business situation . Brad , to give him credit , fully recognized her talents in this field . He often said that she had charmed Harold Hudner , really hypnotized him , that first time Harold had come to their apartment in Beverly Hills . It had been a simple party , just a buffet on the terracefor about five couples , with a young actress ( Sharon had met her at a beach party ) invited to be Harold 's date.  |p141Very  simple but really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Brad could barbecue the steaks himself , and after supper and a reasonable settling-down period with some old Courvoisier , they had gone on to the Trocadero to hear Duke Ellington . The actress had flirted most effectively with Harold Hudner . Her career had n't been going well and it seemed possible that she felt that contact with a newspaper tycoon , and especially a young one , might turn out to be of some advantage . Harold Hudner had responded with enthusiasm . Usually a rather timid , although not an unattractive fellow , he had recently undergone psychoanalysis , which was just coming into vogue . Anyway , when on the dance floor with the girl in his arms he had n't been retarded by inhibitions . " Do you think I ought to say something to her ? " Sharon asked a little anxiously . " Are you kidding ? " Brad said . " Hell , no . " " I just mentioned it , dear , because I thought she might be overplayingher hand , " Sharon said . " What she 's overplaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but do n't worry about it . That 's the advantage of a joint with a five-dollar cover . Nobody gets thrown out . " " I 'm awfully glad , dear , " Sharon said ; " I thought I might have made a mistake about her . She seemed so dewy and all , there on the beach the day we met . " " Leave her alone , " Brad said . " She 's doing fine . " " That night , " Brad sometimes reminisced , " was what clinched the column . That was what did it . " " What clinched the column , " Sharon always answered , " was you , Brad , and your ability . Just that and nothing else . " However , she was pleased . And certainly the party had n't hurt anything . It had n't done a bit of harm . With an outfit as big as Hurd-Hudner you did n't land a column overnight . Brad had begun by guesting , with half a dozen other writers , for a regular Hurd-Hudner columnist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substitute when the columnist 's annualholiday rolled around once more . This had been a mistake  --  one of the few Brad had made . The columnist 's influence had still been strong enough to make his protest stick . Brad , however , started contributing special articles to the Hurd-Hudner feature page . He had been way out ahead as the columnist 's eventual replacement when the latter 's time off began coming at more frequent intervals and it turned out , to no one 's surprise , that he was fatally ill . Bradp142immediately stepped into the job , while his predecessor , in accordance with H-H 's generous policy toward aged or ailing employees , was pensioned off in Florida to die in peace . Brad 's column was to have a West Coast angle  --  a logical step . Most of Hurd-Hudner 's circulation lay in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific Coast states . Harold Hudner held that columns angled around Eastern activities and personalities could be pretty tiresome . Take Walter Lippmann . Lots of papers bought him and some peopleliked him ; but if you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know , half the time , what in hell he was trying to say . Brad 's column was to be less commentary than an evaluation of American life . Some of the titles considered were " Nuggets and Tailings " ( rejected on the ground that it sounded too much like a frontier throwback , with the added possibility that readers might not understand the word tailings ) , " The Lariat " ( rejected as too cowboyish ) and " Sombrero in the Ring " with a picture of Brad wearing a ten-gallon hat  --  a form of headgear he had never previously worn and in which he looked absolutely frightful . The title finally chosen was " Pacific Periscope . " Some HurdHudnerexecutives thought the word Pacific localized the point of reference , but Harold Hudner , when the discussion grew warm , held that localization might be an advantage . Hurd-Hudner did not care whether Brad 's copy moved on the wire out of Los Angeles or San Francisco ; in fact , of the two cities , they rather preferred San Francisco as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brad could go home ! They spent a number of evenings discussing the move and decided to rent in Burlingame , a place where both had friends and which was near enough to the city so Brad could commute . They soon found an almostideal house  --  well within their budget and quite modern yet without the least suggestion of being pretentious . ( If you had money in Burlingame it was always a good idea not to show it , since so many people were sure to have more . ) Also , by fortunate coincidence , Hal Shirer , one of Brad 's best friends when they had been in Cal together , sat on the membership committee of the Indian Pipe Country Club , and before the summer had run its course the Iversonsreceived a flattering letter from Indian Pipe advising them that their application for membership had been accepted . Thus they entered a new and happy phase of their life together , a most agreeable life at that time for both of them , the only cloud on its pleasant surfacebeing the incidents which , much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her relations with Anchylus.  |p143LOOKING  BACK on that summer , Sharon felt it had been one of the best . The Depression had been over , barring a slight cyclicalsetback , and the saber-rattling in Europe could be disregarded because Hitler himself said that he would never go to war and President Roosevelt had come out flatly and said he hated war . Sharon took Brad to the eight-sixteen in the morning and picked him up on the five-thirty-two so they had a good deal of time together , and this time was generally well occupied : there were club dances every Saturday night preceded by dinner parties , and during the week there were always smaller parties which ended earlier becausethe men had to take the train in the morning . The small parties were almost more fun because then you could be with the people you especially liked . Sharon liked almost everyone ; she was so glad to be in Burlingame rather than Atherton , where the Saxe family had spent so many summers . She had inherited Atherton but she and Brad had conquered Burlingame together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy life they led were anothertestimonial to the advancement of her favorite project  --  Brad 's success . It was a different story when Anchylus started making a fool of himself . Brad should never have taken Anchylus to the club . That was the start of it . They had met on the train one Friday afternoon and Brad had suggested that they both get off at Burlingame and go to Indian Pipe for a drink . It had been a friendly invitation on Brad 's part , quite a generous one , in fact , since he knew all about Anchylus ' initial resistance to accepting him as a son-in-law . Whatever reservations the two had been entertaining with regard to each other were wiped out that afternoon  --  wiped out to such good effect that a similar get-together took place a week or so later . Before long Anchylus had started dropping into the club without the formality of an invitation ; once or twice he even brought with him guests of his own  --  and of a type which occasioned comment among the members . Brad did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he did , Anchylus ' tippling sessions with the characters he brought along to divert him had assumed the proportions of a scandal . The first intimation , for the Iversons , of what was going on took place on a warm day in July . Brad had been playing golf . He wasp144taking a shower when one of the stewards came into the locker room and told him that his " guests " were waiting ; when Brad asked what guests , the steward said , " Mr. Anchylus Saxe and a friend . " Brad put on his clothes as fast as he could . He went straight to the bar . Here he found Anchylus seated with a man he did n't know but who was introduced to him as " Mr. Rudolph Ruggioni . " Brad recognizedthe name . He had even written a column about his fatherin-law'sfriend . Ruggioni was an ex-member of a murder syndicate ; his testimony had turned state 's evidence at the trial of one of his former associates . Recently The Day had been running his reminiscencesas a feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet you , sir , " Brad said rather formally . He shook hands heartily with Ruggioni . He then took a seat beside him at the table as if in very truth both Ruggioni and Anchylus were present by his own wish . A quick glance around the bar had shown him the source of the steward 's message  --  a group of older members seated at a near-by table with their gray or white or bone-colored heads close together . This group  --  known as the Cardiac Legislature  --  were all senior members of the club and also gentlemen of prominence in city affairs . Brad guessed that they had recognized Ruggioni and had chosen to ascertain , by sending the steward to check with him , whether or not they could ask to have him thrown out . Since his own presence made ejection impossible , the incident had passed off without public embarrassment . Brad had been amused by the whole thing . Sharon , however , was furious when she heard about it . " How could Anchy dare ? " " I do n't suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Of course he did . He just thought he was putting one over . " " I doubt it . It might even have been partly my fault . The firsttime I took him there I told him to drop in again any time . " " Oh , my God , " Sharon said , " do n't you know you ca n't say thatkind of thing to Anchy ? He 's absolutely literal ! If you said anytime ' he thinks you mean  --  " "  --  any time , " Brad supplied as emotion seemed to choke his wife , " Exactly , " Sharon said . There was a pause . " You 'll have to tell him , " she said , " that he ca n't go there any more . " " He can , though , if we invite him . " " We 're not going to invite him . " " It might have been just a passing whim , " Brad suggested , " or he might even have done it to impress this Ruggioni character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a North Beach spaghettihouse . It 's not that , but there could be a reason  --  a real one . And the more I think about it , I think I know what it was . He went there as a deliberate sneer . He was laughing at us for taking pride in the club . " " Oh , come on , Shar , " Brad said , surprised at her vehemence , " that 's pretty farfetched , do n't you think ? " " No , I do n't . Please remember I know him a lot better than you do . He 'd be proud to be in Indian Pipe if it was his club . But it 's ours , so it 's funny to him . He does n't want any of us to have anything unless it comes from him . " " Well , " Brad said , " he 'll probably never do it again . " " I think he will . Or something just as bad . I think you 'd better tell him to stay out of there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . " " You could n't ? Well , I could , " Sharon said . She turned her martiniglass thoughtfully on its small paper coaster . " I love this place and I love the club , " she said . " We 've gotten them for ourselves and I 'm not going to let him spoil them for us . " CAREFUL INQUIRIES among her friends reassured Sharon somewhat : none of them seemed to know that her father had even been at Indian Pipe the previous week , let alone that he had taken a gangster there . When another week passed with no reappearanceof Anchylus on the club premises , she began to wonder if Brad had been right : Anchy might not go there any more . The hope soon proved to be vain . Sharon had been playing bridge and was giving a lift home to Cordelia Feltrap and Cordelia 's mother , Mrs. Bartley Stigmire , when Mrs. Stigmire asked with an arch glance at Cordelia how Sharon 's dear father was these days . " I 'd never met him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " until we ran into him leaving the club the other evening . Such an interesting person ! " " When was this ? " Sharon asked . " Let me see . . . " Mrs. Stigmire said . " One night last week . He had a wee imp of a man with him ; I believe he had something to do with horses . " " His name was Dowdy , Mother , " Cordelia said . " Johnny Dowdy . He 's a jockey . " " Yes , I 've heard of him , " Sharon said.  |p146The  Day had been giving considerable space to Dowdy , a rider who had brought in a record number of winners on California tracks that year . " Mr. Stigmire and I were with Admiral and Mrs. Chumm , " Mrs. Stigmire went on . " The Admiral went over at once to help Mr. Saxe . " " To help  --  " " With the little horse person . I 'm afraid he had been drinking ; he could n't walk very well at all . Your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , Cordelia ? " " I do n't remember , Mother , " Cordelia said shortly . She evidently felt her mother was laying it on . " Oh , I know what it was , " Mrs. Stigmire said . " He said this Johnny Whatshisname had stirrup legs . ' Do n't you love it ? He said his legs were no good at all unless he had a saddle to separate them . " " I really do n't think Sharon is interested , Mother , " Cordelia Feltrapsaid . " Why , of course she is , dear , " Mrs. Stigmire said . She turned to Sharon . " You must have a most delightful time with your father and the individuals with whom he comes in contact . Such bonhomie ! He and the Admiral folded the little imp , my dear ; they bent him over like an envelope  --  an envelope , perhaps with too much inside it . " Mrs. Stigmire giggled at her own joke . " Then your father 's chauffeur turned up and they all drove off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her motor . She was impatient to get her passengersout of the station wagon . " How that old harpy loved giving me the needle ! " she said later to Brad . " To hell with her , " Brad said . " That 's all very well , to say to hell with her , " Sharon said , " you did n't have to listen to it . You were n't there . " " Well , no , I was n't , kiddo , " Brad said in a mollifying way , " I was n't , but why worry about that kind of chatter ? " " If it was something that affected you , at Hurd-Hudner , for example , you 'd worry about it . " " Well , maybe so , " Brad said . " I 'll try to find out what really happened . I had n't heard a thing about it . " Sharon said , " For my part , I 've heard all I want to . He 's got to stay out of the club . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll think of a way to put it to him . "  | " I 've thought of a way , " Sharon said . " I asked you once to do something about it and you did n't . Now I 'm going to do something about it myself . " She could tell Brad did n't take her seriously , but she did n't care . She knew what she would do . She would protect the life she 'd made . Anchylus could n't have it . Not that he wanted it . To him the rules of a small community or even of a city were ridiculous . He was above rules . They were for other people . He could do as he liked . He made up his own rules . Always as a child she had believed his rules . Then she 'd found out they did n't apply . His idea that he could bring a bastard daughterhome and raise her with his other children had n't applied . It was legal all right . She herself and Alexandra had covered that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules beyond legality . By these rules and in the eyes of people who adhered to them he stood condemned . He 'd done something that was n't done . Breaking a rule like that meant that you were set apart . The walls of your house becametransparent . The walls might be made of stone six feet thick , but the eyes of the people outside could see through them . You went on thinking that you in your grand house were lucky and privileged whereas actually you were far less fortunate than the outsidersin their lesser houses . You had to be more beautiful than they , as Alexandra had said once ; you had to be smarter and more daringand give better parties because no rules protected you any more and stones could come whistling at any time with sharp , splintering crashes through the glass wall of the house and knock you down and turn you black and blue . You had made up your own rules and they did n't hold , no matter how secure and legal and worthwhile they seemed . You had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a person because you were living a liefThat was where she and Alexandra had split off . They had stopped believing Anchylus ' rules or even their mother 's . Alexandra had split off first . She had gone so far she could n't ever get all the way back , and because of her special talents and looks , that did n't matterso much to Alexandra , Sharon thought ; but she herself had done differently . She had wanted to get back inside . She had wanted to live in a house with four solid walls , but here was Anchylus barging in again , big and laughing , strong and disdainful , ready to break out one side of her house and put the glass back in . To hell with him . She was all through with him . She 'd got this for herself and she was going to keep it . Indian Pipe might not be much . She had no illusions about that . When you came down to it ,  |p148she  did n't care about country clubs any more than Anchylus did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club and the good opinion of the people of it . If he could spoil that he could spoil anything else she had or might ever get . She meant to stop him . She meant to make him stay out of her life from now on and the Indian Pipe issue was a good place to take her stand. 6 As soon as the eight-sixteen had pulled out the next morning Sharon went home and changed her clothes . Then she drove up to the city . Normally she would have gone up on the train with Brad , but though she knew she was deceiving him in this small way , and felt rather bad about it , the little deception appeared infinitely preferable to getting involved in an argument . Without bothering to telephone for an appointment , she went to her father 's office and sent in her name . There were the usual two secretaries in the outer office , the pleasantgray-haired Miss Wilke and a younger one . They looked at her curiously as she stood by the desk of the former , taking off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stylish cotton suit with the cultured pearls Brad had given her around her throat and the real diamond and sapphire bracelet Jessica had given her around her wrist  --  the boss 's daughter , young and expensive and inimical . She could see her own image in a wall mirror and she was satisfied with it , although under her well-arranged exterior she felt an emotion resemblingpanic . Except for the time she had argued with Anchylus about marrying Brad , she had never matched wills with him on any issue  --  much less such a formidable one as this . There was a moment while Miss Wilke was speaking on the intercom when she did n't think she had the nerve for it . Then the door of the inner office opened and Anchylus himself came out with both hands outstretched . " Well , Daughter ! By God , this is a pleasure . Come in , come in and make yourself at home . " He drew her toward him , seemingly with the intention of kissing her  --  a contact which she avoided by turning her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this action , for the benefit of the staring secretaries , by a bright , false smile . A thickset man with a red face , not wearing any tie , was sitting by Anchylus ' desk . He rose as they entered . " Dan , you remember my daughter , Sharon ? Guess you haven'tp149seen her in some time , though  --  Mrs. Brad Iverson now . Our secretary-treasurer , Mr. Daniel Winkler . " " How do you do , Mr. Winkler , " Sharon said . The red-faced man put his thick , round head on one side . " A pleasure , Mrs. Iverson . I 'd like to make a small bet you would n't remember when we met before . You were so high . " Mr. Winkler indicated the height with his hand . " You and your sister came in here one day dressed up in your pretty white dresses and I took you through the plant . Circulation manager I was in those days . A long time ago . " " Of course , " Sharon said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared , whether Mr. Winkler could tell from her face that she did not remember at all . She and Zan , it was true , had visited the Day Building on several occasions  --  birthdays and so forth . They had later eventually become rather bored with such " tours . " " Well , Anchylus , " Mr. Winkler said , " I guess it 's time I was moving . I know how it is when a daughter walks in on you . No more work that day  --  that 's what mine always has in mind . So what can you do ? We go out shopping .... " He shook hands with Sharon again before leaving the office . " Dan is getting to be pretty old now , " Anchylus said , " like everythingelse around here . Still , we could n't get out the paper without him . " He set out a chair for Sharon , moving around the desk to his own side and picking up a pipe as he sat down . The pipe was still going . Sharon remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he laid them down on a table , never seemed to go out . She liked them much better , smelly as they were , than his cigars . " Tell you what , " he said , puffing , as she looked at him with a strained face , feeling for a sentence that would open her attack . " Dan said he knocks off work when his daughter comes pestering around . Well , if he can do it , so can I. I 've got just two , three calls to make . Then what do you say we go somewhere and have lunch ? Anywhere you like  --  that is , " he added , sensing from her tenseness and strained expression that her call on him was not as casual as he had first supposed , " that is , unless you have something else in mind . " " Well , I have  --  I mean , I 'm afraid I ca n't lunch with you , Father , " Sharon said . " If you want to make your calls , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Anchylus waved deprecatingly , dismissingthis . " What I  --  the reason I stopped in to see you won'tp150take up much of your time . It 's . . . something I have to ask you and it 's rather private . " Anchylus peered at her under his heavy eyebrows through a cloud of smoke . He leaned forward and snapped the switch of the intercom . " No calls till I tell you , " he said . He sat back , his thumbs in his vest loops , waiting . " Go ahead , " he said . " I have to ask you , " Sharon said in a thin , raw voice , " not to go to Indian Pipe any more . " She had taken the plunge . If it was not the tactful opening she had been groping for , at least it said what she wanted . The tightness in her throat relaxed and she felt in her handbag for a cigarette , her eyes fixed on her father . Because her own statement had required such an effort she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part ; she was a little surprised when none resulted . Anchylus ' behavior was so mild , even stupefied , that she was not sure at first he 'd understood what she said . He sat quietly smoking , rubbing his cheekbone with his mashed right hand . " No ? " he said . " Not  --  What 's wrong ? " " It 's just that , well , just that you ca n't , that 's all , " Sharon said , her voice a little steadier now . " A club has to have rules , you know , Father , sometimes very strict ones . While it 's true that Brad and I belong and that I know he 's glad to take you there from time to time , it 's no good , just no good at all , to have you going there alone . Or taking your own guests . " Anchylus looked at her fixedly and quietly . It was now quite clear that he understood . " Well , I 'll be god-damned , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sharon said . She made the word cursing very reproachful , as if he 'd used a four-letter word . She wanted desperately to find something about him that she could fasten on as a reason for the anger mounting inside her , the shapelessand almost objectless rage that she had brought in with her and that had been piling up perhaps ever since she had been a child . " I said , I 'll be god-damned . " " All right , Father , " Sharon said . " I 'd hoped you 'd understand . It has n't been easy to come here and say what I 've had to say , but I felt it was absolutely necessary . Otherwise I would n't have come . We live in Burlingame , Brad and I , and we have n't lived there very long . I 've felt we were both of us lucky to meet so many people and have them like us and to be asked to join the club . That has been very important to both of us , and it 's absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burlingame , as if it were a saloon where you can take all sorts of peculiar not to say objectionable and impossible people and fill them up with whisky till they 're fallingdown drunk . A friend saw you leaving with that jockey , Johnny Doody or whatever his name is , and I know just what happened . I heard all about it and I ca n't tell you how I feel about it . It was , well , honestly and truthfully , revolting . " Anchylus sat square as a graven image in his heavy clothes , with his unreasonably pale and mottled face , digesting her words . " Johnny Dowdy , " he said . " Yes , that 's right . The boy does n't drink , not as a rule . Ca n't hold it . He was feeling no pain , no pain at all . " He grinned slightly at the memory and flipped with his hands on the desk . The flipping was an action Sharon had never seen him performbefore . Although his hands were formidable , they seemed helplessas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond and flopping on the bank . " No pain , " he said . Sharon 's carefully lipsticked mouth drew slightly open , showing her small teeth in a grimace which was not , however , humorous . " It was n't funny at all , Father . That sort of thing honestly is n't funny to me or to anyone else , and I want you to know that nothing like it can ever happen again . It 's just too embarrassing to us and too . . . too frightful . So please promise you 'll stay away from IndianPipe from now on unless we take you there . " While she spoke she was watching his hands  --  quiet for a moment and then flipping again , the mashed right hand a little less conspicuously than the left . She would have liked to make him stop this flipping at all costs , the peculiar little action which told her that she had hurt him by what she said , that she 'd driven the barbs of her words deep into some unprotected part of him . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him more and more . " Naturally , " she finished , " if Brad should meet you somewhere and invite you  --  if he should , I mean , take you there personally , that would be different , and in that case , of course , you would be free to go in like any other guest . I am not referring to anything like that when I ask you to stay away  --  only to these expeditions you 've been making by yourself with drunken jockeys and Sicilian murderers and so on . " Anchylus now noticed the flipping of his hands . He brought it to an end by putting one hand over the other and holding them both against the desk . He nodded several times.  | " All right , all right , Shar . Have it your own way . Slobs  --  most of them in that club . I know them , but I made  --  That 's all , I guess ; just as you say . " He glared at her , puckering up his mouth as old men do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lunch . . . . Tell Mr. Winkler I 'm free now , if he 'd care to come back , " he said into the intercom. 7 JESSICA was very angry when she heard about this conversation . She took Sharon heavily to task for it . " You know your father does n't understand about clubs , " she said . " He keeps his own doors open . He does n't see why people should band into groups to keep theirs closed . " " He understands better now , Mother , " Sharon said . " It 's unfortunate he learned to do so from his own daughter . He may have been wrong in going to the club , but in speaking to him as you did you seem to have forgotten that children should respect their parents . " " Look , Mother , " Sharon said , " I 'm grown up now and I have my own life to live . I want to live without interference from him . That 's something that perhaps even you do n't understand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . During the rest of that summer and all the summers of the years following , Anchylus did not visit the Iversons even when his wife did , nor did he go to the club . When he and Brad met on the train they chatted as before but Brad got off at Burlingame and Anchylus rode on to his own station . Severance from her father , though a relief in a sense , had one unforeseen result . It left Sharon alone to deal with her creation  --  the success of Bradley Iverson . Success could be , but was not necessarily , a monster . Nor was she a female Frankenstein . If her time and thoughts and energy for a considerable span of years had gone into the project of making Brad 's dreams come true , was that so strange ? He was her husband : not to have helped him would have made her feel useless indeed . What was peculiar was that as time passed she took less and less satisfaction in the outcome of her efforts ; in fact , she sometimes felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the structureof her life resembled an illustration for Gulliver 's Travels , one of the books Jessica had read to her , Alexandra and Pamela whenp153they were children . The figure in the foreground was a big typewriterto which numerous thumb-sized people were attached by threads , forced to depress the keys by jumping on them and to drag the heavy carriage back and forth . One of these people , in her fancy , was herself . The image was ridiculous , she was quite aware of that . However , there could be no doubt that her importance in Brad 's life had lessened as the objectives he wanted were attained . There was no use getting upset . Having persuaded him to accept his glory as his own creation , she could n't very well take credit for bringing it about . She could only hope that when the dizziness engenderedby his rapid rise had worn off somewhat , he might settle down and be his own sweet self again . Never great , the chances of this solution 's coming to pass were destroyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japs attackedPearl Harbor . Brad held an ROTC commission as a second lieutenant . When the nation flew to arms , he was sure he would be called up . " Once soldiering gets into your system , " he explained to Sharon , " you do n't forget it . In the old days at Cal I could take apart the breechblock of a seventy-five and put it together again , blindfolded . And I mean blindfolded . " For once  --  possibly because her concept of Brad in uniform , with or without a blindfold , was so new to her  --  Sharon allowed herself a negative position . " That 's wonderful , dear , " she said ; " only , are you sure they still use them ? " " Use what ? Soldiers ? " Brad said with irritation . " I only meant . . . that kind of gun , " Sharon said quickly , pullingback to a prepared position . " Weapons may change , " Brad said ; " it 's men who are standard equipment . " He smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentalnote to use his comment about weapons in a future column . Sharon recognized this , but leaned across the small , candlelit table to squeeze his hand . " Oh , Brad , " she said sincerely , " if you have to go , I do n't know what I 'll do . " They were dining tete-a-tete in a restaurant  --  a sort of send-off dinner , with champagne and pheasant-under-glass . Brad had set the next day as the time when he would offer his services to the Army Recruiting Office in San Mateo . Sharon was very gay throughout the meal , and during the drive home she snuggled up against him . Theirp154mood of closeness , culminating in the love-making which came later , successfully bridged not only the strain put upon him by the task of volunteering but the ensuing despondency when he was turned down . Actually , he was called back twice for medical examination . The whole trouble had been the knee cartilage he had torn while playing a sand shot from a trap on the second hole at Indian Pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . Everything was soon different in Burlingame . Meat , gas and even whisky were hard to get in any quantity , and on the golf course now you ran into groups of servicemen in skivey shorts and governmentissueshirts and government-issue pants playing free of charge  --  a courtesy extended to them by the Greens Committee . Sharon had taken up golf herself in preference to bridge . She could n't stand sitting on her duff for four or five hours with the women who were perpetually yammering about their husbands in the service and their kids in school . She was lonely . If Brad had been somewhat careermindedbefore , he was twice as busy now that he had a war to comment on . He spent as much time in Washington as he did on the Coast . Sometimes she went with him on his transcontinental commutationtrips , but this was n't easy to arrange  --  Brad 's priority for travel did n't include a wife . Sharon thought of the period between 1941 and 1944 as a sort of limbo . The United States was putting forth the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Her one consolation was the fact that Alexandra , as beautiful and gay as ever , had come back to San Francisco . Alexandra had acquired a European way of looking at life and even a faint European accent which , though it was no doubt a little affected , seemed to go with her personality . She was wonderfully resilient . It was remarkable how little she 'd been thrown off stride by her divorce from Schuyler Cutting . That marriage had never had a chance ; while Alexandra had been awfullyfond of Schuy , it was a little too much when he borrowed money on her diamond earrings and then lost it in one evening 's activities at Monte Carlo . Finally , just before the war , and just when Alexandrahad met a few people on the Riviera who were halfway nice , including Casi Dandopolis , a Greek who had invited them to go to Brazil on his yacht , Schuy had insisted on rushing to Paris , his mother having shown up there . That had been the last straw . If people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should have seen her at the George Cinq with that dyed streak in her hair and her crazyp155twin chows on a gold-mesh leash . Her one saving grace was that she 'd been decent about the property settlement  --  forking up out of her own pocket , since Schuy did n't have a cent in his own name . She 'd paid some of his debts and carted him off somewhere while Alexandra came home by herself , bringing the Bentley she 'd bought when she and Schuy had been in England . She 'd left some of her clothes because she expected to go right back . " I suppose , " she 'd said , " some Nazi general 's mistress is having a ball in my Patou originals , probably still owed for by Schuy . " " Oh , Zan , " Sharon said , " how horrible ! " It was pleasant to be Alexandra 's confidante once more , almost like the old days at California Street come back again . In the loneliness of the life she was currently leading the meetings with Zan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without realizing how it had happened , she had cut herself off . Alexandra for her part enjoyedgossiping about her new beau , a Hungarian nobleman who had recently left his own country , taking refuge in San Francisco , where he had friends . Though not wealthy , he cared nothing for money , only for fun . He was quite a noted horseman and had represented his country in the Olympic Games in Berlin before the war . " You 're sure it 's not just the title that attracts you ? " Sharon asked . She wished she sounded less like Jessica when she made this kind of remark . Alexandra , even before her debut , had shown a partiality for titles . Alexandra smiled . " Just wait till you meet him , " she said enigmatically , " just you wait ! " Nick Drobny turned out to be a tall , dark man , put together with a great length of heavy bone and a dissatisfied , impatient face . It was a little hard to believe that he had been , as Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German Occupation ; he was so agreeable in manner . Positively frivolous . He kissed Sharon 's hand in a manner which made her reluctant to wash it for two days afterward . He also had a trick with a martini glass : after drinking its contents he would put the glass itself into his mouth and solemnly chew it up , pretending to swallow the pieces . Sharon thought he was one of the handsomest and most amusing fellows she had ever met , but neither then nor on the other occasions when they were together could she think of anything to say to him , and she wondered what subjects Alexandra turned to when she was n't making love . She found to her surprise , however , that she wasp156slightly jealous of her sister 's good fortune , starting on a brand-new venture with such an attractive fellow while she herself was stranded , as it were , on a shoal . One day she appeared at the weekly luncheon listless and fatigued . " What 's wrong , Chicken ? " Alexandra demanded . " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how wonderful , " Alexandra said . " Why do you say it 's wonderful ? I 'm not going to have one . I just want one . " " That 's what I mean . It 's so marvelously normal and all that , " Alexandra said . " I ca n't help it , that 's the way I feel . " " I wish I did , " Alexandra said . " What makes you ? " " What makes me what ? " " Feel as if you wanted to . . . fecundate ? If that 's the word . Where does it affect you ? " " Good God , Zan , it does n't affect me anywhere  --  physically . It 's not like that . It 's a state of mind . " " That 's what 's so amazing , " Alexandra said . " I 've always wondered about that . " " Have n't you ever felt it ? " " Not even remotely . " " I think that 's rather odd , if you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . I  --  " " But most women do want children , Zan . Sometime or other . You have the equipment to reproduce . I suppose nature makes you want to use it . " " You only have half the equipment , dear , " Alexandra said . " Men have the other half . Your half makes it easy to swell up and lose your figure and then get a lot of horrible pains . I never saw the point of it . If it 's a state of mind , I must have had a mental hysterectomy . Does n't Brad want a baby ? " " I do n't think so . " " Did he ever say so ? " " No . " " Then he might be delighted . " " Well , I do n't think so . " " Why ? " " If you mention babies and your husband knows you 're for them , and he does n't mention babies , you can figure he 's against them . Anyhow , that 's how I look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  |p157Sharon  added , taking thought , " I suppose if you wanted babies nothingwould ever stop you . Nothing ever does stop you . " She relapsed into silence , smoking moodily and playing with the silverware . " Shar , " Alexandra said with a gleam of suspicion , " do you swear you 're not pregnant ? " " Of course . " " But if you want a baby so much  --  " Sharon lifted her head . " That would never work with Brad . No gay little surprises . Anything you do with Brad has got to be a mutualundertaking . Carefully planned , with him in charge . " " Then put him in charge , " Alexandra suggested . " Point out the joys and benefits of fatherhood . " " You do n't understand , Zan , " Sharon said . " It 's different with Brad and me . I guess I ca n't explain it . " " How do you mean , different ? " " I suppose , " Sharon said , " we started with a. different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more clever and all that . I made him feel that nobody would be able to love him the way I would  --  and did . He was supposed to be everything I 'd ever need . So if I need a baby , that 's a split . A new conception . Do you see what I mean ? It 's as if I were saying , Brad , you 're not enough . I have to have some new person , even if I have to manufacture one . Far from being complimentary , it would be a lowering . And you must never lower Brad . That 's rule number one . All this must seem horribly complicated . " " Not at all , " Alexandra said . " It 's very simple . " " I wish there were a simple answer to it , " Sharon said . " There is , " Alexandra said . " Divorce him and marry a man that wants babies . " " I 'd be miserable without Brad . " " Are n't you also slightly miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be without him . I 'm not changeble , the way you are . My feelings are dismally permanent . I do n't t want anybody 's baby . I want Brad 's baby . " " Then that 's the answer , Chicken , " Alexandra said triumphantly . " ' There 's no split . Do n't you see ? No lowering at all . You want not INs Brad but more Brad  --  another little piece of him . You 're notanging the conception ; you 're making it bigger . " " Well , it 's a thought , " Sharon said dubiously . She blew out smoke . " Yes , " she said after an interval . " If I knew how to present that perly it might work . It just might . "  | " Of course it would , " Alexandra said encouragingly . " Try it and see . I know everything will be all right . Where is Brad now ? " " In Washington , " Sharon said . " If I were you , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm sure somebody can get you on a plane . I 'd go there and tie on a whing-ding and then tell him . Tact is always better when there is a little sex in it , I do n't care who the man is . And as I say , I know a little bit about  --  " " You do , Zan , you certainly do , " Sharon said . " And you 've been a dear to give me so much good advice . I 'll think it over , I really will . " " Whether you go or not , " Alexandra said , " be sure and tell me how you make out . " 8 SHARON DECIDED not to go to Washington . Brad 's aversion to surprises made the trip seem ill-advised ; also , he gave her a job to do . He telephoned one evening and told her to look for a house  --  he made it clear he meant a house that they could buy . When she reminded him that the lease at Bridge Road ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they could always sublet . He 'd decided it was time they bought a house in Burlingame . " I 've been thinking , " he said . " It 's time we stopped living like gypsies . " Sharon wondered if , through some telepathic influence , his thoughts had been moving in the same channel as hers . However , she successfully produced a light tone . " Not many gypsies live with two in help and a teletype in the den . " " You know what I mean , kiddo , " Brad said with a touch of irritation . ' We ought to have a house to keep . Do n't you like the idea ? " " I love it , " Sharon said quickly . " I 'll start looking right away . Does this mean that we can spend more time in Burlingame ? Because I 'd love that too ; you know I would . " " Maybe , " Brad said laconically . " Hard to say for sure . I 'll know more when I see you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon said . " Something is , " Brad said , " something big . I ca n't talk now , though , and I 've got a million calls to make . So do n't ask questions . Just find us a house . I 'll see you next week . " The business of driving around with agents to look at propertiesp159was stimulating . Sharon found herself living a fantasy life in each house she entered , clothing unknown pleasures in the mood of echoing halls and unexplored rooms . She could see winter fires blazing in the clean , blackened hearths the past owners had left behind ; she could hear the babble of dinner parties in the stripped salons and the clink of cocktail ice on the empty terraces . And always there was a room  --  not always the grandest or sunniest , but alwayssuitable  --  a room for the child or children which were part of all her imaginings these days . She worked hard . By the time Brad returned she 'd found a place on Floribunda Avenue she was sure he 'd like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all prices up , since nobody could build , and this house served to combine solidity and charm in a way that was most unusual . There were four bedrooms , two with balconies , and a fine , rich lawn shaded with sycamores and Chinese elms . The dining room was small , but large dining rooms were starting to go out of style so this did n't matter too much , and the living room was huge , with dark oak paneling like the California Street library and a handsomefieldstone fireplace to give it a country air . The grounds were spacious . She was so sure of Brad 's reaction that she made an appointment with the agent to show the house on the day of his arrival . Brad walked nervously through all the rooms . He tried the closet doors and the watertaps and he rapped on the paneling with his knuckles to see if there were termites . " Not bad , " he conceded . " Not perfect , but not bad at all . " " It is awfully expensive , " Sharon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If it were to be overcome , it must be faced at once . " Well , yes and no , " Brad said . " That does n't bother me . We 're in for inflation now and all prices are too high , but they 'll go higher . " He sat down in an iron chair beside the empty swimming pool . Sharon walked back to get rid of the agent . Brad must not be rushed . It would be a good idea if he were left alone to think it over . When he strolled into the house half an hour later , still abstracted but apparently satisfied , she felt that the deal was as good as made . " You promised to tell me what was cooking at H-H , " she said gently as they drove back to the small and now , as it seemed , pitifullyinadequate house on Bridge Road . " Do you want to talk about it now ? " Brad chuckled . " The picture 's been changing , Shar , " he said ; " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with it . "  |p160When  he said " picture " she knew she was expected to supply an automatic modifier  --  the Hurd-Hudner picture . " In what way ? " she asked . Brad held up a finger . " Number one , " he said , " the national angle . I 'm not saying Periscope ' has done it all  --  there are several factorsto be taken into account  --  but we 've been building circulation faster than a cat can spit . Then again  --  " he held up another finger  --  " the business angle . Have you noticed how I 've been soft-pedaling it in Periscope ' lately ? Too much other writing is focused on business . The Wall Street Journal has piled up a lot of readership for the West Coast edition , which means we should maybe ease up on that angle . So , the gist of it is I 'm to have complete autonomy . I can live where I want , write what I want . Harold is even talking about a new name for the column . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks to get Pacific Periscope , ' and you 've always been so pleased with it , " Sharon said . " I have , " Brad said , " but as I say  --  well , Harold seems to feel that authorship , not locality , should be the key . You know the new name that 's practically decided on ? I 'll give you three guesses  --  only when I tell you , keep it under your hat . " " Periscope '  --  without Pacific ' ? " she suggested hopefully . " Nope . That was mentioned , but opinion was against it . Mightsound too much like a naval affairs column or something . The newname will be . . . Iverson : " " Iverson or Iverson 's ? " she asked , not quite sure if she had heard him properly . " Good God , Sharon , " he said irritably . " ' Iverson 's ' sounds like Lloyd 's ' or Cook 's . ' This is n't an insurance company or a travel bureau . It 's a syndicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : My name , or possibly Brad Iverson : The brass is still kicking that around , which one to use . " " That 's very flattering , " Sharon said . " You do n't like it ? " " Of course I like it , Brad , " she said . " I just want to ask you one question . If they 're dropping the word Pacific , are they dropping the Pacific angle ? Because if they are , I do n't see why we 're buying a house in Burlingame . " " They 're not dropping it , kiddo . Far from it , " Brad said . " You do n't get my point . " " I 'm sorry , Brad , " Sharon said with quick contrition . She waited for him to go on . " I 've got to have a base , " Brad said . " A home place , you mightp161say . How much of the Pacific angle goes into Iverson ' is up to me , and I intend to put a lot of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career terms . We 've been yelling bad rice long enough . " " Bad rice ? " " That 's what Chinese farmers are supposed to say when they have a good crop . To fool the gods . We 've got it made now , kiddo , and our way of living should reflect it . Hence the house . Later , if need be , we can have a duplicate setup in Bethesda or Washington  --  sort of divide our time between there and the Coast . Too early to tell about that yet . But meanwhile , at least we 'll be located . Do you know what I was looking at while I sat out there by the pool ? " " The trees ? " " Nope . They 're all right . Good , solid trees , but you can take trees like that for granted when you have a solid house . I was looking at the old tennis court . What a place to put a suite ! You know what I mean ? A bungalow office suite like in a motion-picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I did , Brad , " Sharon said slowly . " I had an idea about it too . " " Honey ! " Brad said , pleased . He put his arm around her . " Do n't give me credit where I do n't deserve it , dear , " Sharon said . " I did n't think of the executive suite . Perhaps I 'd better not tell you my idea . " " Go ahead , Shar . If you want the tennis court we 'll put the bungalowsome other place . ' What was your notion ? " " I was thinking it would make a nice play yard , if we ever had children . " " Good God ! " Brad said . She waited for some clarification of his exclamation . " You 're not pregnant by any chance , are you ? " he asked . He did n't say it pleasantly . The die had been cast , and she 'd lost . " That 's what Alexandra asked me , " she said . " You talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sharon said . " I just told her I wanted children . I said I wanted them and you did n't . That was when she asked me if I were pregnant . Well , do n't worry , I 'm not . " Brad drove for a few moments without saying anything . His profilelooked handsome , rejective and annoyed . " It 's not a case of worrying , Shar , " he said at length . " I was n't worried . I trust your good sense . " " My good sense not to want a family ? " The words burst from Sharon . She clasped her hands , twisting her fingers against her rings in an effort to regain her composure.  | " Not at all , " Brad said calmly . " I do n't know where you got the idea that I do n't want children . It 's a matter of timing . If I had childrenI 'd want to  --  well , take them on walks , read to them , and all that . Or just lie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know what I mean ? " Sharon said nothing . After waiting for a reasonable time for her reply , Brad put out his hand and laid it on her forearm . Sharon pulled quickly out of reach . " Now , Shar , " he said . " Now , what ? " she said . " We do n't have to brew up a storm about this , do we ? " " No , " she said , " we do n't . So suppose we drop it . All right ? " " Sure , " Brad said . " Let 's drop it . Only , I 'd like you to understand my attitude . Frankly , I do n't think you do . " " I understand it , Brad , " she said . " Children are a possible for us , " Brad said ; " they 're not ruled out . " " I know , Brad , " she said , " but ca n't we drop it , please ? Pretty please ? " " They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the agenda , for future discussion . I could n't do the things I 'd want to do with children , or a child , as busy as I am now . It 's all a question of timing . " " Maybe the perfect timing would be never , " Sharon said as if to herself . " Now you 're being unfair , " Brad said sternly . " I 'm afraid I ca n't discuss this any further . " " That 's what I suggested , " Sharon said . Neither spoke again until they were at home on Bridge Road and the car was parked in the garage and Brad 's suitcase carried up to the bedroom . " You know , kiddo , " he said in a friendly tone , " I 'm sorry we had that argument about the tennis court . Because I like the house . I 'm going to make an offer on it . " " The tennis court ! " Sharon said . " Of course , " Brad said . " Is that what we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to putting his suit on a hanger . " I 'm sorry , " he repeated , " because I bought you a little present . Jaeckel 's is mailing it out . Now I 'm sorry that I did n't bring it with me . It might put you in a better frame of mind . " " Jaeckel 's ? " Sharon said . " That fur store in New York , " Brad said . " Now I suppose you'vep163guessed what it is . So I might as well tell you . I ca n't afford it  --  neither of us can  --  but , well , I bought it for you anyway . Sort of felt like celebrating . It 's a natural dark mink coat , like Alexandra 's . " " Thank you , " Sharon said . " That was awfully sweet of you , Brad . " " All right , " Brad said , " go on being difficult . I think you 'll feel different when you see it . I think you 'll feel a little bit ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " All right , all right , " he said . " A dark natural mink coat is something that I 've always wanted , " she said . " I can have an awful lot of fun with a mink coat . " She smiled so brightly that Brad , seeing her reflection in his bedroommirror , looked at her sharply to see if she was coming around . " Why not ? " he said . " Oh , but I will , " she said . " I 'm going to get a little book with a pink cover . I 'll write down the mink 's weight and the date when he says his first words and when he starts to walk . " " Very funny , " Brad said . " With snapshots , of course , " she said , " and school reports . " " Oh , knock it off , Sharon , " Brad said . " Do n't you think we ought to save the mink 's first pair of shoes ? We could cast them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you do n't want it , " Brad said , " you do n't have to take it . But there 's no sense ridiculing it . A coat like that costs a lot of money . We can always send it back . " " A dark , natural mink , dear ? " Sharon said . " Oh , heavens , no . I 'd never do that . But if it got to be a nuisance , of course , we could alwaysput it up for adoption . " Brad gave her a furious look and walked out of the room . Dinner was a strained affair  --  not at all a proper homecoming . Brad and Sharon spoke to each other only when Alfonse , the male member of their Belgian couple , was in the room serving . Later , one of Brad 's secretaries came for dictation . Sharon took her coffee out onto the patio . She sat there alone . She felt tired and mixed up . Why had she insisted on the quarrel ? She 'd known in advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's views on the subject under discussion . She 'd behaved stupidly , not like herself at all , for although perhaps not clever in many ways , or at least not thinking of herself as clever , she 'd always , she thought , been clever in her handling of Brad . It had all been so unnecessary ! He 'd been thinking of her while he was back East . He 'd even bought her a generous present . You could n't hit him over the headp164for that , just as you could n't point a pistol at him and demand he give you children . And why the pitch on children all of a sudden ? Was it really such a strong drive from within herself ? She was n't sure of this now either . She thought some of it was real . She thought she would be a good mother . Every woman , probably , except self-centered freaks like Alexandra , wanted children so she could prove she was a woman  --  physically and also emotionally . But such desires , such thoughts , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't boil over in fierce quarrels and bitter , humiliated feelings , such as she had had today . Alone in the cool early evening with the air of the summer night around her , she tried to peer into herself and find out about all this . Was n't the need to have a child combined with the need to have a greater hold on Brad , to bring him back and tie him to her inextricably ? No doubt of it  --  yet she had failed to see this . She had turned Brad away from her just when she wanted him most . She had been wrong . She must acknowledge her mistake . She must blot out the quarrel as if it had never occurred , get back to the status of " two against the world "  --  Brad 's career and happiness her one objective . Through the French windows of the living room she could see him folding up his papers . The secretary was leaving . He smiled at the secretary , sharing some thought with her that was concerned with work  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be terrible if work ruled out herself , his wife , as it would and could quite easily sometime , if she let it . To hold Brad she must go on being invaluable . She must be a part of his public presentation of himself . She must give , work and plan . If selfish desires plagued her she must subjugate them to a higher purpose  --  their nearness , their closeness . Inside the house , Brad left the living room , escorting the secretary to the front door . When he re-entered he sat down a little wearily . The light from the desk lamp spilled into his face at an angle that showed its bones and hollows . He looked older than usual  --  middle aged , almost . It was the first time she had ever seen him look that way and a feeling of protective love passed through her . She stepped quickly through the French doors and went up to him . " Brad , " she said , " I 'm sorry . I was stupid today . Can you forgive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reaffirmed . It was a workable arrangement , even a happy one  --  and proof that it was workable and happy , if you needed any proof , lay in the fact that the retitled and streamlined column , " Iverson , " by the estimatesof the Audit Bureau of Circulation reached a public of four million readers . One of Brad 's prized possessions was the original of a New Yorker cartoon : a clubman ordering his breakfast , saying to the waiter , " I take a cup of coffee in the morning . A cup of coffee and Brad Iversonis all I need . " Another treasure , also framed , photostated and enlarged , which made the yearly hegira from Burlingame to Bethesda , was an editorial pointing out that he had brought social consciousnessto the mass audience which had once read him just to be amused . The fact that the editorial had appeared only in papers servicedby Hurd-Hudner syndicate did not detract from its value in his eyes , any more than the fact that he 'd been paid to pose for it diminished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he could be glimpsed in hunting pinks standing in front of an open fire caressing a fine , pure-bred beagle hound . The physical process of getting out the column had been brought together under one roof . Commuting to an office was a nuisance and , in view of his solidified position , quite unnecessary . Brad soon completed the executive bungalow he had conceived as an addition to the Burlingame house . His own sanctum was cork-lined to keep out disturbing noises . From it , stretching down a long hall , were  --  in that order  --  a file room , a reference library , another office in which sat the secretaries  --  Miss Malone , the column secretary , Miss Kohler , the correspondence secretary , and Miss Finch , who answered the telephones . There was also a room for the AP and UP teletypes . Brad liked to get his column done by noon . At this hour the Ilurd-Hudner office called and Miss Malone read the typed pages over the telephone to a secretary in New York , a method which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brad , meanwhile , would be on his way to a luncheon date . He kept apintmentsuntil late in the afternoon . Between six and seven-thirtyattended cocktail parties  --  there were usually several to choosem  --  and he liked to have Sharon go with him . Cocktail partiesa working period for Brad  --  he was gathering material  --  nor didroutine vary much when he left Burlingame to work in Washing/ton . He did n't encourage late dining : he could pump the news out of an ordinary group and be in bed with the light out by midnight . He was up by eight . One of the most valued periods of the day , to Sharon , was breakfast , a meal which by long habit they took together . No matter how rushed he might happen to be , Brad had never let business wholly encroach on this interlude ; however , for a number of months , he had been bringing mail and newspapers to the morning table , giving his attention to these while he gulped down his food , then jumping up suddenly with the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment for some time on this change in their relationship , but finally one day , following an eveningwhen they had been out unusually late , she let it be seen that she was n't too happy about it . " Brad , " she said mildly , " could n't you sit down and chat for a minute ? " " Something , kiddo ? " Brad said genially . He smiled at her but remainedstanding . " Only that I never seem to see you any more , " Sharon said . " I take a cup of coffee in the morning . A cup of coffee and Brad Iversonis all I need  --  but all I get is a cup of coffee . Do n't you think we could talk things over sometimes , the way we used to ? " Brad now sat down as requested but he looked ready to get up again . " Well , yes , kiddo , we could , " he said , " only maybe not right at this time . " " There never seems to be any right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times , " Brad said , " only you and I do n't alwayshit on subjects for discussion . Subjects that are fascinating , that is , at eight-thirty in the morning . " " Well , " Sharon said , " we could talk about something , I think . Once in a while . Or if all else failed , you could read me some of the better cracks from yesterday 's column . " " That 's not a very brilliant remark , Shar , " Brad said with no show of rancor . " No , " Sharon said , " I suppose it is n't . I 've been incommunicado so long I may be losing the knack for making brilliant remarks . " " But not , " Brad said , " for making mean ones . Are the old nerves jumping around this morning , kiddo ? " " Yes , " Sharon said , " they are and have been for quite some time . I 've been wondering about a lot of things . Such as , for instance , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , this time despairingly , at the gold clock.  |p167The  moment had come for him to go out to the bungalow suite , but it was obvious that for today this moment would have to be deferred . He settled back and lighted a cigarette . " If we have to go into it , you 're a whole lot of use to me and you know it . So why go into it ? " " Because I 'd like to know , that 's all . You used to talk over your work with me ; now you have n't time . Sometimes you used to come home early and we 'd make love in the afternoon . Remember ? But we have n't got time for that either . " " We 'll have it , " Brad said , " we 'll definitely have it . " " I 'll bet , " Sharon said , " provided I can get myself appointed a Presidential aide . That , or steal a State Department file ! Something that would make me worth your while . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be honest with you . Right now I do n't know what you 're driving at or what this conversation is expected to accomplish . If you 're trying to tell me that you have n't had enough attention , that 's something that can be changed , but not , as I say , just when I  --  " " I 'm no use to you , " Sharon said ; " I just feel that I 'm no use to you at all . " " That , " Brad said , " is , if you 'll pardon the expression , crapola . " " I 'll pardon the expression , " Sharon said , " but I 'll be damned if I want to go on being miserable and lonely . It does n't make any sense . I used to think you valued my opinion . Then I decided you just needed me for an audience . It 's obvious now that neither is true . So what am I hanging around for ? Of course , I can still entertain for you and I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me tell you something  --  you embarrass me when I 'm trying to be a good wife and you 're playing footsie with the wife of some Congressional Committeeman . I wish I knew what the score is , that 's all . " Brad removed specks of tobacco from his lower lip . He said , with no alteration in his composure , " It 's a foul situation all right . Somethinghas to be done about it . " " Something certainly has , " Sharon said ; " and if you wo n't do it , maybe I 'll have to . " To her surprise she felt tears rising in her eyes . She blinked them hack , but the tears grew larger and coursed down her cheeks . She was sorry for herself and at the same time furious with Brad because he 'd kept his temper : he would n't waste on her the emotional energy he needed for his work . " God , you can be irritating , " she said . " I 'm sure of it , " Brad said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room as if looking for a means of escape.  | " Brad , " she said , almost pleadingly , " I did n't mean to be tiresome . Perhaps you 're right , my nerves are jumping , but it 's not only that . Maybe it 's stupid but that 's how I 've felt  --  and it 's been getting worse . Could n't we take a holiday , just the two of us ? Could n't we go somewhere and let me get over it ? " Brad poured some cold coffee in a cup and swirled it around ; he peered into it like a soothsayer into a fowl 's entrails . " Well , I do n't know , " he said reflectively ; " that 's not a bad idea . " " I think it 's a good idea , " Sharon said ; " you do n't know how much I 'd like to do it . I think it 's what we both need , I really do . " Brad drank the coffee . " Not a bad idea at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go ? And when ? Those things have to be considered too . " " Anywhere at all , " Sharon said feverishly , " I do n't care . But I think it should be right away . How long has it been since you had a vacation ? Three years ? " Brad shrugged . " About that , I guess . Vacation , schmacation . In this business you do n't get vacations . " " Pegler gets them , " Sharon said , " Winchell and Pearson get them . The syndicate just prints a line  --  Mr. So-and-so has gone fishing or something . Column will be resumed when he returns . Oh , Brad . It would be such fun . Ca n't we go ? " She got up , her hands on his arms , her face tensely raised . She could see he was tempted ; she felt that much of the future , perhaps their whole life together , swung on the decision . " Ca n't we , Brad ? " He held her closely for a moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only I tell you what . I 'll have to get a few columns ahead . You know H-H . He 's a stickler for operational procedure , but I 'll speak to him about it as soon as I get back to Washington . " " You do n't want me to go back to Washington with you ? " Sharon asked , a prescience of danger skidding down her spine . " Well , sure I want you to , " Brad said , " but on the other hand , what would be the use  --  making a big move out of it if we 're going on a trip ? You can get us cleared away here and read some travel folders . I 'll have Miss Finch get them for you .... Now , kiddo , do n't look like that . Being separated for a while may sort of relax us , make the trip more fun . Then the first minute I can get away , off we 'll go to Shangri-la or maybe Acapulco like a couple of insanc honeymooners . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lie around all day swilling champagne and making love , just you and me on a tropical isle . How will that be ? " " It sounds nice , " Sharon said.  | " HAS N'T HE said anything more about the trip ? " Alexandra asked . " Not a thing . He never even mentions it . I 'm still supposedto be looking up planes to Mexico . Or making plans to canoe up the St. Lawrence  --  by myself . Not that I really mind . This is the sort of thing that does harm  --  " Sharon laid the clipping on the table between their respective cocktail glasses , now empty . It was a Monday in the spring of 1945 and the sisters were lunchingtogether in the St. Francis . Long ago , in some dim moment of the city 's evolution , wives and daughters of the better sort had set aside Monday lunch in the St. Francis to prove  --  by conspicuous food consumption on a day ordinarily set aside for laundry work  --  that they no longer tubbed their own clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been much disturbed by an item which had appeared that day in Letty Meeker 's column ; though she had assumed ( correctly ) that her sister had already seen it , she had read it to her on the telephone , then cut it out and brought it with her . She wanted its wording subjected to further analysis . Burlingame 's INDIAN PIPE SET Letty Meeker had written , using her own quaint system of italics are worried about the PROLONGED SEPARATIONS of the Bradley Iversons . Well , dears , we can report there 's nothing to worry about  --  As OF NOW . It 's just that there 's still a war on and Brad is an AWFULLY BUSY MAN with all the high-powered writing he has to do , and all ... " What a foul bitch ! " Alexandra said . " Is n't she , though ? " " Now you may have an idea of the kind of thing she 's been doing to me for the last ten years , " Alexandra said . She took out of her purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by long possession and wrapped in two bits of yellow paper . " I thought we might compare notes , " she said , " because I have an idea about that woman . I 'm going to get her fired , if it 's the last thing I ever do . " Through the large oblong room the maitre d'hotel could be seen approaching , herding ahead of him the waiter carrying their secondp170round of drinks . The maitre d'hotel bowed before them  --  two bows  --  one for each . " Madame , " he said to Sharon . He took the martini from the waiter 's tray and set it before her . " Baroness ! " he said to Alexandra , giving her the double daiquiri . Earnest never forgot who had ordered which drink . " Thank you , Earnest , " Alexandra said . " Are we ready to order something to eat now ? " Earnest inquired . " Not quite yet for me , Earnest , " Alexandra said . " I 'll finish this and then I 'll see if I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame ? " Earnest said to Sharon . " I 'll have the chicken patty , " Sharon said . " I suppose that 's all that 's any good . " " The chicken patty is very nice , " Earnest said . " We have also the Crab Louie . " " Is that nice ? " Earnest 's face reflected nothing but approbation for the Crab Louie but he allowed a suggestion of regret to color his voice . The crab was nice , but out of season . He was sorry that he had no steaks . Soon , if the war news stayed good , there would be plenty of steaks , God willing . He whipped the menus off the table and gave the drink and food order to the waiter standing just behind him . Sharon raised her glass . It was fine being with Alexandra and having a chance to talk about things she could n't discuss at the same level with anybody else . She had been looking forward particularly to this lunch , their first since her sister 's return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandra , she thought , certainly looked well . She and Nicky had bought a ranch near Sonoma  --  orAlexandra had bought it , Sharon suspected , as a present for her bridegroom , as well as a joint residence , the point of a ranch being that Nicky needed horses to ride . The switch to an outdoor life was something new for Alexandra , but it evidently agreed with her . She had a wonderful tan , and if her skin had coarsened somewhat , this was n't true of her body . She had lost weight and there was a new suppleness and muscular toughness about her that seemed just as effective in its way , though possibly not quite so flattering , as her former voluptuous , indoor beauty . She did seem to be drinking a good deal , but perhaps that was a habit one got into when one lived on a ranch . " You mean to say you 've kept all that stuff ? " Sharon looked incredulouslyat the soggy mass of clippings . It was unlike **25;1367;TOOLONG this new , ranchy Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that she must hate Letty as much as , if not more than , Letty hated her . " It all goes back to your debut , of course , " Sharon said . " Did I ever tell you about the scene she made ? " " You did n't , but Mother wrote me about it ! How she came poundingon the door , yelling that I 'd ruined her exclusive . ' Then she had the gall to make it look as if I 'd eloped with Schuy because I was dead drunk . Midnight Troth Follows Gay Champagne Party . ' I telegraphed Anchy . Do you want to see what I said ? I kept a copy of it  --  and of his answer . I want to rub his nose in both of them someday . And I know how to do it , believe me . " Alexandra seemed about to say something more but instead compressedher lips . While Sharon examined the clippings and the two telegraph forms in which they were wrapped , she stared out sullenly into the room as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ componentsof some Florentine plot , hatched by herself  --  a plot whose seductions might leave rapiered bodies in canals and courtiers rotting in dungeons . Come to think of it , there was something definitely medieval , whether Florentine or not , about Alexandra : her power for decisions , her melting beauty with its reserves of stamina that would wear down a horse , not to mention a man ; the hungers and the ruthlessnessthat made common cause with an accountant 's practicality . No one knew Alexandra who did n't know this about her , the conjoiningof many imps within her , all schooled to pass unnoticed exceptat such shadowy moments as the present when , in silk doublets , daggers in hand , you saw them peering like assassins from the corners of her eyes . The first telegram  --  a carbon of one that had been sent  --  was sent from Reno in 1934 and addressed to Anchylus Saxe , 8 The Day Building , San Francisco , California .

The wishes expressed in the last line had an ironic air when consideredwith the items which followed  --  Letty 's comments on the progress of the marriage . Letty had kept track of all developments , and her reportage made up in accuracy whatever it lacked in cordiality . Since Alexandra had spent most of the period in Europe it was hard to say offhand where Letty had got her information . Part of it , no doubt , had come from columnists such as Cholly Knickerbocker , specializing in the doings of the international set ; by the late thirties Alexandra 's Continental capers had made her eligible for this kind of coverage . Another source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scandal about somebody else for a favorable mention for themselves . Letty was a power ; her dislike was feared , her favor sought even by individuals so situated that they could well have afforded to remain indifferent to her . Her memory was as accurate in recalling an obligation as in avenging a slight and her perpetual harassment of her enemies had become an important part of a journalistictechnique designed to give a sense of superiority to those whom she flattered . Marry in haste , repent in Monte Carlo , we always say . TooBAD that the repentance of the charming SCHUYLER CUTTINGS took the form of such BAD LUCK at the tables and such an unfortunatePUBLIC QUARREL in the Casino bar . There were other notes of the same sort . San Francisco of the period must have found them amusing . When Letty could n't use Alexandra as a target , she could use Schuy  --  and she did . Schuyler Cutting wo n't get a State Department job in Europe . TOO BAD . He 'd told his friends he was so SURE of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAY at a party in Fouquet 's attended by the Maharajah of Jodhpur and F. Scott Fitzgerald , the DRUNKEN American writer . After the Cuttings had moved to Berlin , Letty wrote : It could be that the Cuttings are RUNNING OUT of countries to play in , particularly the sort of play at which MONEYp173CHANGES HANDS . Some of his checks have been so RUBBERY they have bounced CLEAR across the Atlantic , where his mother has had to make them GOOD . The divorce coverage which came later had an I-told-you note , unpleasant to the subjects , diverting to the reader . There followed a series of observations on Alexandra 's career in New York and points east , few of them flattering ; from Letty 's accounts it would have seemed that Alexandra 's choice of escorts had been limited to men who were wanted ( a ) by the police , ( b ) by their wives or ( c ) by nobody . As for example her description of Nick Drobny , her bridegroom , as a man with " one of the highest-priced titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed , false enough to go to court over or unsavory enough to offend The Day 's readers . Yet all , taken together , added up to a curious hellbox of spite , as timeless and destructive as the hate which had made Alexandra keep them , plotting her revenge . " Now , " she said as Sharon finished , " if you think she 's treated you badly , look what she 's done to me . Do you blame me for feeling as I do ? " " I do n't , Zan . I do n't at all , only  --  " Alexandra squeezed her arm . " You must help me , " she said . Vaguely , but with great emotion , " Help me , Chicken . " " But I do n't see , Zan , " Sharon said shakily , " how I cm . I mean , what we can do about any of this . " " We can do a great deal , " Alexandra said firmly . She watched , as if from another planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not now , perhaps , " she amended , " but someday . We can and , if we 're smart , we will  --  " " You mean , you have it all planned ? " " Well , not planned exactly , but someday we 'll own The Day . You seem to forget that . Mother gets all of Grandfather Fabian 's stock , plus half of Anchy 's . It 's all really ours , it 's in trust for us , and when you get to own stock you can run a company . You can fire anyone you want , even the boss . Keep in mind what I 'm saying . " " You mean , our beloved father ? " " I cross-examined George Dudley on this . Here 's what he told me. ost companies today are controlled with far less than fifty-one per it  --  some with only small percentages . Look , Anchy only kept clue and a half per cent for himself . Each of us girls has the same twelve and a half . If any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . That would sew up the situation , would n't it ? " " I suppose it would , " Sharon said uncertainly . This type of thinkingwas new to her . It was n't too complicated , but it was hard for her to get her mind on figures . Alexandra pressed on . " He might be the one who winds up without a job himself . Would n't that be marvelous ? " The Florentine courtiers were laughing . Heads thrown back , mustachiospointed at the sky , they enjoyed their illusionary triumph ; the blades in their hands glittered in the moonlight while the waiter served the plates of chicken patty . " You 'll see , Sweetie , " Alexandra said , " what fun we 'll both get out of it . So you will help , wo n't you ? Please say you will . I 'll feel so much better . " " Of course I 'll help , dear , " Sharon said . " Just tell me what I have to do . " Sharon was later to recall that lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was to recall them on a day when , due to accidentmore than anything else , she found herself the only member of the family present at Jessica 's deathbed . She was also to recall , even in the helplessness of her grief , the decision she had made at that luncheon , a decision which , for good and sufficient reason , she was not fated to keep and which , as a matter of fact , she took considerablepleasure , when the time came , in recanting . For herself , she had accepted her fate . She was lonely much of the time , even when Brad was in Burlingame , but there was no more talk now of a second honeymoon . She had stopped reflecting on how different her life might have been if Brad had wanted children . Several times in the next three or four years she decided she was pregnant ; for a week or so she would laugh or cry without any reason , she would experience an imaginary but effective type of morning sickness , take naps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a condition which lasted only until the pregnancy turned out to be a mistake and she would return to her normal level of adjusted restlessness . Was n't it better , perhaps , to be a little unhappy rather than wholly bored like so many of her friends ? At least she had the satisfaction of being married to a man who , when he did n't shut her out of his life , could command her entire attention . He had one weakness  --  he could n't love " for keeps . " She could love no other way . At least the house on Floribunda Avenuewas charming , and they gave some splendid parties there . Norp175was love , even on her own terms , entirely ruled out . Tenderness came through sometimes , hope came through . And Brad 's writing was going marvelously . He was not a monster , not that at all . He was a brilliant man who in the throes of his career had naturally becomea little isolated , a little self-centered . It was an old , familiar story . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the water due to the lightnessof their loads  --  the supply ships homeward bound , the transports in their tattered war paint , cut loose from their convoysat last , the hospital vessels still splashed hopefully with big red crosses . Many of the wounded could not come up on deck but there were always ambulatory cases who could ; they stood at the rail smoking and staring , and in their faces when seen closely there was a bemused , guarded expression of attentiveness and unbelief . Most of them had at some time abandoned hope of ever seeing this again  --  the gray harbor , the big bridges , the prison island , the hills and the docks , the shore , the lights of home . Seeing it was a miracle , but with it went another , even stranger : there was a welcomer for each man in the city just as if the hills , the water and the stony houses had been streamlined into a woman 's face . Sometimes the face was known and dear and sometimes featurelessand undefined  --  a Possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beckoning shore . Statistically , it is interesting to note that the woman was more often real than imaginary ; if not real at first , she rapidly materialized . In the Marriage License Bureau , that worn , ink-stained jumping-offplace , many young campaigners with old faces were busy crystallizing their welcome . Thus one summer afternoon shortly beforeV-J Day in 1945 , The Day included in its column of Vital Statistics under the subhead Marriages an interesting item : Harper , Clifford F. ; Saxe , PamelaThe groom was a big , light-haired fellow in brand-new civilian clothes . He had just been honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps , Third Division Reinforced . His discharge , which he had with him when applying for his marriage license , affirmed that he had participated in actions in Okinawa , Saipan and Pelelius ; under the column headed Remarks it contained the words Service Honest and Faithful . This observation was in general an al most complete biography of Bridegroom Clifford Harper except that he was twenty-three years old , that he lacked any well-establishedtrade or profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of San Francisco was not merely a port of arrival but his home . He had once won an Ivor Johnson bicycle in a Day circula/ANCHYLUS had lived alone a good deal in the months beforeGeneral MacArthur signed for peace with his five pens . Jessicahad been advised , for the sake of her health , to stay in the country . He missed her , and to make up for it worked harder than ever , got out the paper , messed around in politics as usual , sat late in restaurants discussing how , when the chance came , the people of the United States could get the Democrats out of the White House . He had n't the slightest inkling that trouble might be brewing with one , and possibly two , of his daughters . When his mind tracked back into the past to consider family hurts , he was solaced by one developmentwhich took place at this time : the heartening revival of his relationship with Pamela , that one of his three daughters whose behaviorhad most puzzled him . It was good having something nice happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one  --  was in the throes of being born . It was a world that took some getting used to.  |p181tion  contest , had taken and passed a lifesaving test at the Berkeley YMCA , and had been a high-school letterman in football and basketball . These situations and achievements had been highlights in his life . Also at one time he had owned an old Dodge roadster which had twin pipes and was tooled to look like a hop-up even though it was n't one . It had Here Comes Cliff painted across the hood and There Goes Cliff on the rear . Also the words Pass with Care and No Horns , Please , Driver Sleeping . Cliff had always been a good boy . He had been a wonderful son , his mother said . Yet he had always had a mind of his own . In spite of his popularity and his liking for sports and a good time there had been days when Cliff seemed moody and would lie around the house or go out to his workbench in the garage and make things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffer what pursuit he planned to follow after marriage , Cliff said that he was going to settle down in San Francisco . He had sometimes thought about going in the photographybusiness . Or he might do garage work . He was n't dead set . I Ie 'd have to see . The bride wore gray . She was a well-built , medium-sized girl with red hair and grayish green eyes and a habit of slightly compressing her rather full lips before she spoke or smiled . She was several years older than the groom . In addition to the tight-fitting gray suit and small white hat , she wore black pumps and a white corsage and carried a black patent-leather purse . She gave her occupation as nurse and her address as Treasure Island Naval Hospital . The Day staffer never thought to connect her name with that of Anchylus Saxe , boss of the paper which employed him . He had n't worked for The Day very long and did n't know much about the boss 's family . When Matt Brody ate him out later for goofing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Anchylus Saxe going down to the City hail and getting married to a gyrene . Experience is an imponderable , no two persons receiving the same impression from a shared event . Nevertheless , it can be said broadly that to both Mr. and Mrs. Harper the steps leading up to their marriage seemed to have been arranged by friendly , possibly divine forces , and to have been inevitable and simple . This was , of course , a silly idea . While a certain amount of argument could haven brought up to support the notion of the friendly forces , noththathad made the Harper-Saxe item a vital statistic , exceptybe the love that had gone into it , was what you could haveed simple.  |p182Two  WARS HAD , to start with , helped to shape up this statistic  --  the first one no less than the second . In that first war one particularday was important . For George D. Harper , later to be the father of Cliff , the day was the one on which two regiments of the First U.S. Army under Maj. Gen. Carlton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village of Dortmont , in the St. Mihiel salient . By four o'clock that afternoon the German command had fallen back and in the evening , their supply having caught up with them , the Americans dug in . The rain , which had lifted during the attack , set in again ; a southeast wind was blowing steadily and at dawn the Germans counterattacked across a vineyard . Private George D. Harper knew what had happened to him all right . After one whiff of the stuff smelling like newly mown hay he crawled out of the shell hole because the stuff was heavy and always sought a lower level . He got his gas mask on before he passed out . He spent four months in a base hospital at Lille , France , and close to a year at the VA Hospital in Sawtelle , California . The doctors told him when he got his discharge that if he was careful he 'd have nothing to worry about . George Harper was careful . He was careful working in the Black Cat Mine in Climax , Colorado , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then and he was careful later when he found the dust in the mine made his wheeze worse , and he and his wife , Midge , moved to San Francisco , where there was said to be possi ble jobs and not much dust . Here he went to work for a garage , and in San Francisco his children were born , all four of them , between the years of 1922 and 1930 , Cliff being the oldest . " Wrap up your chest , " his wife would call to him on foggy oi windy days , and George would wag his head as if Midge bored him with her worrying , but he would wrap up as she told him to . The wheeze was always there . You had to put your head against George 's chest to hear it . It was buried way inside of him out of sight , quiet , rapacious and patient . It was one day one hour one secondof that war not lost in peace or hushed by victory but living on alive inside George Harper . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fascinating . It was one of the many things that made his father a worth-while person , more inter . esting than other people . Cliff liked to crawl up on his father 's lap when company was at the house . Curled in a comfortable position.  |p183he  would listen to the second voice that rustled , oh so gently , inside George Harper . While George 's real voice was laughing or talking , the second voice continued to repeat its perpetual story about the shot-up vineyard and the men in the holes and the corpses under the bare trees and in the ditch in front of the hedge and the rifle fire and the grenades and the stuff that smelled like hay . Few people would have ventured to say then , or even believed , that the war  --  and at that time still innocently called The Great War  --  was alive in those years , hidden away , not in the armories where the dusty flags were stored , but in the People , in the living structure of the world , just as the deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harper . There was no sound warning anyone of war in those days . There was prosperity . Before the Harper family had been in San Francisco very long , they too had a piece of this prosperity , made specific by George 's ownership of half the garage and half of the two-family house in the Mission , both garage half and house half being purchasedon time payments . Peace was , of course , a permanent arrangement . When Lindbergh , the daring aviator , flew across the Atlantic , writers pointed out that with planes shuttling around the globe countries would be brought closer together and thus war made impossible . George Harper did n't read much that the writers said . He had prosperity , of course , he knew that , but the trouble with it was he d such a tough time making a living for his family . After Cliff came Tracy ; Denis Harper was born in Lindbergh 's year and Suelen the year a politician , supposedly Herbert Hoover  --  although people were already starting to blame everything on Herbert Hoover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the U.S.A.e was a chicken for every pot . George Harper did n't get to eat much chicken . He had to sell hisrest in the garage but worked steadily as a night repairman for ther garage specializing in highway emergency work  --  the Ajax , on the El Camino Real . One night George got up a sweat get-a wreck slung in the hoist of the tow car and drove back withputtingon his windbreaker . Next morning he was running afever . Two days later he was dead . It was his own fault . He had n't been careful. oral months later with the help of her grocer ( to whom she already owed a large bill ) , Midge Harper opened a soft drink and hamburger stand on the Harding Municipal Golf Course . Cliff helped his mother at the stand . He was a good-looking ,  |p184healthy  kid . Though not big for his age , he was a husky and willingworker . He was the least rowdy of the Harper kids and the quickestto learn anything ; at the stand , he would lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midge ; and when a couple of foursomescame piling into the stand all wanting food at once , he would take the sandwiches his mother fixed and put a relish or some pickle on the paper plate and serve the customers while Midge opened the bottles of coke , cream soda or near-beer . Always Cliff looked at the customers he served with great anxiety , to make sure they were pleased and if , as it often turned out , they were , his face would light with pleasure . Patrons of the stand treated him in a friendly way , especially if they had boys of their own ; on the other hand , some of them flirted with Midge as if she , mother of four children , were still a young girl . Midge could n't stand such talk . Her dark eyes would flash and she would smile warmly and beautifully and tell them to go on about their business . One of the most pleasant men who played golf at Municipal in those Prohibition days was Peter V. Palermo , a businessman . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he said , what difference did it make ? There were no businesses what did n't have illegal aspects . Mr. Palermo numbered among his customers some of the finest families of the city . ( It was he  --  although he did not think to mention this to Midge  --  who supplied the beverages served at the annual outings of the Bohemian Club , of which Mr. George Dudley , attorney for the Saxe family , was a member . ) That was the way it was and if Mr. Roosevelt did what people thought he would do , why , pretty soon Mr. Palermo would be a legal merchant instead of a bum , he said , and Midge pretended to be shocked and asked who would dare call him a bum ? Midge got engaged to Mr. Palermo and the Harpers moved out of the old Mission house ( where they had lost their equity and were living as tenants ) to a better one . There for the first time the girl and boys had separate rooms . Mr. Palermo had the guestroom and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The grocer who had loaned Midge money told her what some of the old crows who traded at his store were saying about her , but Midge told him if that gave them fun , okay , let them go ahead and talk . She had her family to keep and she could n't lie awake nights worrying about that jabber jabber jabber . One April morning , Mr. Palermo was found dead in his car near Pier 27 , his body punctured by a number of slugs from a .45 automatic pistol . The killing obtained a split-column , page-one storyp185in The San Francisco Day , with equivalent coverage in the Chronicle , Examiner and the evening papers . Juvenile authorities sent a woman to inspect the house where Midge and the children had been living . At the next session of the Juvenile Court it was decided that since Mrs. Harper had no means of livelihood and since the childrenhad been found living in undesirable conditions , it would be best for their own sake to take them down to the Otis Street DetentionHome and later perhaps to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support them , and until she could show that conditions were desirable , or in other words , that she was not living with anybody , and above all with anybody like Mr. Peter V. Palermo . It was the most awful thing that had happened since the beginning of the world . It was the end of the world . It was as if a huge snake , with coils stretching all the way from their house to the WelfareHome had slid across their lives , engulfing them with its evilness , tearing them apart from each other , breathing a curse on them with its foul breath and a witchcraft doom out of its staring eyes . Denis and Sue-Ellen were too little to know what was happening ; they thought they were just going for a ride until Sue-Ellen began to sob and then Denis started too . Mrs. Harper had tried to make it seem all right to the children , but the day the car came for them she lost control of herself and ran out of the house and stood there cursing the woman from the Welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midge began to scream . Cliff had got in and sat there quietly looking for the last time at the happy house and his mother standing with her face all twisted and her mouth open . Cliff was yelling too , but only inside . That Welfare Home , the place they all were taken to ! That place . Oh , how Cliff longed for the day when he would be rich , when he would get the Governor or some great man to write an order and would go back there and put an end to it . He would drive up to the door in his car and make an end of it . Mr. Meggs , the principal , could get down on his knees and it would n't help . Cliff would throw him out and all the rest of them ; he would have the place burned . The empty whisky bottles in the closet of Mr. Meggs 's office would n't burn but the canes would and the mattresses they 'd had to sleep on , full of bugs , stinking and rotting because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the john . When everything was burning he would tell people about Mr. Meggs and what he did when he had whipped an older boy in his office and he would have him put in prison.  |p186Cliff  made a friend while he was in the home  --  a freckled , frisky Jewish kid named Kim Borg . Together they had planned how they 'd run away . They tried it twice but each time they were caught . That was when Cliff was eleven and had been in the home for thirteenmonths . All the time Cliff and Sue-Ellen and Denis and Tracy had been in the Welfare Home , their mother , Midge , had been making plans . She had been trying to get them out , she had been writing to them about it and promising . They never doubted the great day would come . And it did come ! Midge got them out . She was marriednow to another Latin-American type man , Rafael Vargas , one of The Day 's district circulation managers  --  the same person who later got the circulation route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , living in a small house in Berkeley , going to a real school , really alive again . Every winter , spring and fall Cliff went to school and studied hard . He got the best marks in his class , especially in history and English . He had the circulation route in summer , a full-time job bossing the other fellows who distributed The Day 's home-deliverededition for Mr. Vargas . He got the Ivor Johnson and the car and the high-school letters and went in the Marine Corps , and all of this seemed in retrospect most satisfactory , particularly since it had led to the best thing of all , namely , getting married to Pam . IT was a warm and sunny day , full of twinkling windshields , hurrying people , excitement and city smells , like the day of a parade or a football game . Cliff and Pam walked away from the City Hall holding hands . Both were silent  --  Cliff out of contentmentand the sense of having settled a most important issue ; Pam because of a problem of conscience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew little about hers . During the short periodof their acquaintanceship she had told him briefly about her family  --  that she had two married sisters , that her real mother was dead but that she had a father and stepmother living in San Francisco . She implied that her family was well-to-do but she was n't sure from Cliff 's reaction whether or not he believed her . Probably many girls , casually met with , tried to assume importance by alleging family status later discovered to be false . It was quite clear that he did n't care what sort of family she came from  --  and this delighted her  --  but he was her husband now and it was time she got busy andp187told him about herself . A wife had to establish her identity in her husband 's eyes even if the problem of establishing it in her own eyes had always been so puzzling that even now , on her wedding day , it had not yet been solved to her full satisfaction . A child , especially a female child , knows when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perhaps no less true that a child senses when a special effort is made not to treat her differently . Her instincts tell her that , under normal circumstances , she would be treated differently at times  --  either favored or discriminatedagainst . To be dealt with at all times in a manner visibly equated with the manner in which one 's sisters are treated can become , by paradox , a highly suspicious form of differentiation . Anchylusand Jessica had been vigilant to see that she was always given her share of presents ( just like Sharon 's and Alexandra 's , particularly in such prized trade goods as jewelry , animals or clothes ) or parties ( attended by your own friends , dear . . . you know that Sharon and Alexandra have their own friends . , and you have yours , so you may invite whomever you wish . . . . ) of picnics and theaters and trips to the country when the Saxes were living in the city and to the city when they were living in the country and to the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for chocolate malts or banana walnut cream parfaits and to movies and symphonies and the circus . There was too much consistency about it all  --  a consistency which developed its own submerged threat . If such care had to be taken to give you the same things as others , yet separate from theirs , what was wrong with you ? Pamela had been reasonably happy growing up in the California Street house and the house in Atherton , but she had had the problemall the time and it had resulted in her strange action , which no one had understood , of going back to Oregon that time , trying to find her mother . Her personal ties with Jessica and Anchylus were firm and she did n't disown or disrespect them , yet she knew that before she could ever know who she really was she would have to go through this process of making a separate life . She would have to smooth herself into the churning yet sharply rhythmed life of the city and be lost among the streaming but secret , individually owned faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a new identity with her name could be born and be hers . She had made up her mind to take this step and nothing could turn her from it . She had made it up long before the coming-out party and Alexandra 's elopement , but she had put off action , not because shep188had wanted the party but because Anchylus and Jessica had wanted her to have it . So she 'd had it . After the party she 'd started talking about the job , and finally they had let her go and look for one . Jessica had understood about it better than Anchylus . He wanted things to be the way he 'd planned them , and the plans had n't included a daughter who lived alone in a walk-up apartment and worked in an office . What was the sense of the expensive schools and the fine clothes and manners and all if your daughter was going to wind up doing that ? He 'd tried to talk her out of it just as he later tried to talk Sharon out of marrying Brad Iverson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " is turning on your own lights . " He had n't added that in his own case this form of loneliness had been avoided because he 'd lived with Red Margaret Tighe or O'BoyIan , as the case might have been  --  a precaution which , since other precautions had been lacking , had resulted in Pamela 's arrival in the world . He added nothing , suggested no alternatives , but he made it clear that he disapproved . " I 'll be all right , Daddy , " Pamela said . " I 'll come home to see you all the time . " He opened his mouth to say it was stupid to pay rent when , if she insisted on working , she could still live at California Street . Pamela could see the thought passing through his head and she could sense , and be grateful for , the fact that he had decided not to say it . " Living alone ! " he said . " It wo n't be nearly as nice as being here with you , Dads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Lots of girls live alone , you know , and I guess they get used to it . " Anchylus rubbed his cheek with his mashed knuckles . " Lots of them get to be old maids , too , " he said bodefully . Pamela laughed . " I 'll be married sometime . " Anchylus snorted . " Why do n't you let your mother give some parties for you , so you can meet a few decent fellows ? " " I do n't want to meet any right now , Dad , " Pamela said , " but I 'll be home a lot . I 'll try to find an apartment that 's not too far away . " She found one on Telegraph Hill . It had one room with a window that tilted you out over the harbor so you felt you could spit into Alcatraz . Anchylus gave her fifty a month to pay the rent , but he still did n't understand and he had n't liked the fellows she occasionallybrought to the California Street house . The result had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , second , she stopped going there herself so much . With Jessica she 'd always keptp189up warm , daughterly feelings , but Anchylus had n't understood and he looked at her , on the rare occasions when they were together , with an obstinate , baffled coldness . She was already a stranger , coming home with tales of working in a drugstore , a department store , a library , a dentist 's office , with kisses on the cheek , presents in a paper bag , and young men who did not amount to much . He had n't forgiven her . That was what made it hard to explain her life to Cliff . How could you explain nine years ? The years had laid a trap for her . You picked a year and made friends with it . You strolled down the street arm in arm with your buddy , the year , taking everything very easy , watching where you put your feet . Then  --  wham . Your buddy was n't there any more . You got your last look at him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The search was still going on for the person she was supposed to meet right off : Miss Identity ; she has red hair , she could say , freckles on the nose . Built like a tennis player . Does n't look too well in clothes , all right without them , I suppose . Very anxious to be in love . Trying that , too . Knowing all about the Mother Bit and the Sigmund Freud Bit , but no answer there either . Told at the desk by the woman in charge that they remembered perfectly , oh , yes , the person who had brought her in , but the card had n't been filled out , and while she changed her clothes and took a bath they had phoned Anchylus Saxe . When she walked into parties given by the young couples , marriedor living together in the rooms on Telegraph or Russian Hill with the sky for wallpaper , right away she took a quick look around to check . Was this the place ? She checked in the bottom of the glasses that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house present , dragging the half-gallon jugs up the sixty-nine steps from Broadway . She checked among the voices , the men infinitely talking , eyes flashing , using intellectual words , particularly toward morning , and the bit about art and the integrity of it all . ( Bill Saroyanhad gone hungry up these same steps to the attics with too much light . ) She searched also , later , among the cigarette butts dying with slow sizzling among the empty cartons that had held potato salad , chow mein , spaghetti , Marx and Steinbeck , the chains you had shed , death on the barricades , Madrid besieged , Daladier kissed for Munich , photographs by Bob Capa , the execution of Federigo Garcia Lorca . Where was the girl ? Nobody knew.  |p190Awake  in the night , she looked tenderly at the sleeping heads of lovers who would be strangers in the morning but whose sealed brows and quiet breathing held , after the pleasures of a temporary madness , a small investment of trust , the faith of princes and children . Finally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one good one she let Jessica get for her , drawing ad layouts for a famous store ( herself , of course , the artist 's recreation of the wanted woman , sketched in the flared or the sheath skirt , the muff , gloves , the adorable sandals , the negligee , the cloche by Mainbocher , the fur by Magnin 's ) . All the various jobs got boring eventually , whether good or bad , fun or not fun , and none of them were real ; somehow they were n't what she 'd been looking for . When the war broke out she took a course to learn to be a nurse 's aide and went to work at Treasure Island . Here she fell in love with a doctor . Her feeling for Dr. ( now Commander ) Don Helm was the most important experience of her life next to her adoption by her father and Jessica and until her meeting with Cliff Harper . Dr. Helm was a married man . He was almost sixty years old . He did n't make love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by his commentson people , situations , the work they were doing , doors to new understanding began to open , as they can only open when one suddenly accepts religion or achieves the friendship of the great . Great was the word for Don Helm . True greatness , yet of such a special kind nine people out of ten would miss it . No bedside manner was his , no big , drippy chunk of good will . He was n't even kind , not in the ordinary sense . He was a surgeon  --  a slender , gray mail , made of bone  --  his hair , skin , fingers and operating gown the soft , aged color of gray bone or driftwood polished by the great storms . His eyes were a little darker gray , but his beard , when he had n't shaved , came in white . It was only when he had a beard that he looked old . In addition to being bone-colored , everything about him was square  --  fingertips , face , brow and chin . This look of squareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit purged of self was what gave him ruggedness . Slender as he was , he appeared stronger in every way than the two-hundred-pound flatfoot corps. men who wheeled in the stretchers . To be with him made Pamela realize that this searching for a " new self " or " independence " or a " mother " was a mirage . Already , through Dr. Helm , her eyes were opened and she could wait for the next thing and be equal to it when it came . She was , within her own compass , the self she needcd to be or to have . What soon gave this self extension and application was her meet/ing with Cliff Harper . If she had n't known Dr. Helm , she might not have been ready for Cliff . She might not have known what to do about him . The meeting happened by accident yet in a natural , convincing manner which was pleasant to look back on later . She had come over to the city in the Navy bus after work with another nurse , Mabel Hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ads and Mabel was a buyer for a department store . Neither had a date that day , and the errands they had to attend to were the type that could be skimmed through lightly . First they went to the store where Mabel had worked and for which Pamela had done the layouts and they strolled around happily chatting with friends . They separated for the errands , met again , went to a movie and then to Solari 's in Maiden Lane , occupying one of the booths close to the bar . It was still early . The bar soaked in a winy midafternoon lull . Two men were talking to the bartender  --  one stocky , nearly bald ; the other big , young , light-haired and shy-looking . The bald fellow , who was rather forward , kept glancing over to get the attention of the girls , but both Mabel and Pam remained elaborately indifferent to these overtures . The fellows , from their conversation , had just been discharged from the service . They were joking with each other about the way they looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to be sure the girls overheard and paid attention , while the younger , better-looking fellow tried from time to time to shush him . The bald fellow had unwrapped something from a brown paper package and was showing it to the bartender and the latter , imressed , called one of the waiters over to look at whatever it was . Mabel got interested too . Pretending she had to go to the toilet , e walked close to the group and on the way back , at the baldlow 's invitation , she stopped and looked at what was in then paper and let out a squeal . " It 's not , " she said ; " you 're kidg . " But the bald fellow kept insisting , and finally Mabel heedhim and she too seemed impressed and brought him over tor table , the big , light-haired boy following . What they had in the brown paper was a shriveled piece of skin di bristly short black hair attached to it . It was the scalp of a dead nese soldier. am did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ething and the hairs growing out of it . If you had nursed in a val General Hospital for nearly two years , you were not going tops up your lunch because someone showed you a dried scalp . en the bald-headed fellow asked her to pick it up , she did so , 192putting it back in the paper and returning it to him . The big , shylookingfellow seemed to feel that she had performed a smart and unexpected action . " Put it away , Herb , " he said , not speaking in the least like the young boy that , in spite of his size , he looked to be , but with authority . Pam now looked at him with attention . She noticed something else about him that did n't go with his youngness . His hands shook . They trembled when he went to lift his drink . He was n't drunk . It was n't that kind of shaking . It must have come from being overseas . " Okay , okay , " the bald-headed one said . He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him to . Pamela turned to the other fellow . She faced him squarely for the first time and smiled warmly , the wide-lipped , curling smile that was one of her greatest charms . " Thank you very much , " she said . The big , light-haired fellow looked shy . He said not to mention it . Somehow they had become a double date . Introductions were exchanged . Now the first round of drinks was bought , Herb Cleary , the bald-headed fellow , paying . The light-haired fellow 's name turned out to be Cliff Harper . Herb and Cliff had straight bourbons , Mabel a Cuba libre and Pam a Scotch . She had never liked cocktails . When Herb asked rakishlywhat two beautiful women were doing all alone downtown on a fine Saturday P.M. , Mabel told him how they had come over after work to see a movie but it had n't been so hot . In a case like that , Herb said , why not take in another ? Mabel said at once , quite primly , she was sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep . But Cliff was n't listening . A pint-sized Italian newsboy went past the table selling papers and Cliff bought a Day and looked up the shows . This would have been the time to tell him , Pam thought . She could call his attention to the newspaper and say casually , " Do you read this much ? My father owns it . . . . " In the first place , they would n't have believed her . In the second place , they would n't have cared . In the third , they would have thought she had flipped her lid . Neither of these fellows had seen a new show in a long time , so it was immaterial what they saw . Mabel and Pam exchanged a highsignand Pam gave a barely perceptible shrug . Then Mabel said they might have time to go , before their engagement , provided they left right after the show.  |p193They  settled on Lana Turner in Slightly Dangerous . Ever since she was little and had gone to her first shows , Pam had liked sitting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't mind that there were n't four together downstairs . The main feature was just starting , and as soon as she and Cliff were seated in the balcony loge , such comfortable seats , the entrancement which she felt at all shows , good and bad , swept softly over Pam . She leaned forward , her lips moist and slightly open , her face rapt , feelingherself drawn into the oneness of the banked tiers of faces looking down , every face drinking in the magic which poured onto the screen in a soft column of metallic light . The picture was a comedy . It was pretty silly ; still , there were true parts . Right from the start Pam sympathized with the situation of Lana Turner , that seductive girl , working in a soda fountain . There she was just pounding along , day after day , so used to her job , bored with it , doing it mechanically , pounding along with no hope , no man in sight except some jerk that always whistled at her on the street , nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize ( in merchandise ) for being on time every day . Pamela laughed with the big laughs that went up from everybody at the screwy things that happened . Lana was supposed to be a lost heiress , but there was the feeling , the knowledge , of what she really was , of what ( without the twist at the end ) she would have gone back to : the job , the lonely pounding . As Pamela followed the flow of images across the screen , another film quite different and without pictures or beauty unrolled in the back of her own mind , a series of emotions and reflections . She knew about this business of being a lost heiress . She rememberedAnchylus saying that the loneliest thing in the world was turningon your own lights . She had been turning hers on now a long time , and she knew what he 'd said was true . Also he 'd said , " People get to be old maids that way . . . . " Was that to be her fate ? You were close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it was to believe , that many people lived and died alone , even in San Francisco . DURING THE PERFORMANCE Cliff 's closeness had been pleasant . Occasionally Pam had let him hold her hand ; she had forgotten , almost , that she was with him . She remembered now . As they came down the heavily carpeted stairs into the lounge , theyp194seemed much better acquainted than they 'd been two and a half hours earlier . Pamela put her arm through Cliff 's in a comradely way and they stood close together in the lobby , watching the doors into the orchestra open and the people come out . The four of them had dinner in a steak house near the theater . During dinner it was clear that Herb was making time with Mabel . Mabel was feeling rather high , and showing it , leaning her head occasionally against Herb 's shoulder . " Take it easy , sonny boy ! " she cautioned him once , playing the part of a maiden sorely beset . Herb grinned . " Listen to Grandma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was eating and drinking prodigiously and looked red in the face . The two men paid the check , splitting it between them , and the foursome walked through the streets , two and two , half listlessly , not sure what to do next . Herb and Mabel dropped back a little , and Pam looked around a couple of times to make sure they were following . She was getting somewhat annoyed with Mabel . Finally she stopped and said decisively , " Where are we going ? " It was clear that the engagement to which the girls had referred earlier was either nonexistent or forgotten . " What do you say we cut a couple of rugs ? " Herb proposed . Pamela looked at Mabel . It took no clairvoyance to discern what , in view of Mabel 's current mood , the evening would be like if they took Herb 's suggestion . " Is that what you want to do ? " she asked Mabel . Herb was apparently now authorized to answer for his companion . He spoke up . " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Eh , Momma ? " " I do n't know why not , " Mabel said good-naturedly . " How do you feel , Pam ? " The girls drew aside and talked together earnestly for a moment , the men doing likewise . Mabel insisted that she did n't care what they did . If Pam did n't feel like stepping out , she , Mabel , did n't either . Pamela told her to go ahead , she was tired , but Mabel and Herb could go . She wanted Mabel to go . " So long , kids , do n't do anything I would n't do , " Herb said . He signaled a cab , which , although it already contained two passengers , swung toward the curb , obedient to the share-the-ride system then in vogue . " I 'll call you tomorrow , " Mabel called to Pam . With a flash of plump blond leg she vanished into the cab . " You mus n't mind her , " Pam told Cliff as they resumed theirp195stroll along the street , packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , really . She works like crazy ; once in a while she cuts loose , that 's all . " " She seems mighty regular , " Cliff said . A strangeness , now that they were alone , had fallen between them . They let themselves be carried by the crowd , sometimes pausing to look in store windows , so curiously light after the dim-out of recent months . Pam 's feet were getting tired , though , in the high-heeled shoes . Cliff noticed her dragging steps and asked her if she 'd like a drink . Pam said no , he might think she was crazy , but she 'd like an ice-cream soda , and Cliff said fine , he could use a cup of coffee . Only it happened that the drugstore where they went was closingup and since the coffee was all gone Cliff had an ice-cream soda too . Riding across town on the bus Pam was silent , fully aware now of this fellow with her and of all the things she 'd noticed about him ( luring the evening which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person : his shyness , bigness , the youthfulness which did n't fit in with the harsh man 's voice in which he 'd told Herb Cleary to wrap up the scalp , and then the way his large bony hands shook when he handled things and his embarrassment at this . God , he was young , younger in years than she and younger in experience also in spite of all that had happened to him . He needed somebody all right , maybe just as bad or even worse than she did , but he was strong too . With a fellow like this the proposition would n't be entirely onesided . It would n't be all giving . They had three blocks to walk when they got off the bus , then thesteep side of the hill to climb . Pam knew every paving stone in thosethree blocks ; she ought to : she walked them twice a day , on her wayto and from work . She knew how the raw facades of the houseslooked at morning and at night , in spring , summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paving stones were repetitions ofthe steps she took in passing them . They were Yesterday and Tomorrow , her fight to make a life for herself , the dark face of memoryand the blank face of the future . This was her street but she wasdone , a stranger here ; the mood of bitterness that made her identifyherself with the imaginary struggle of the sodajerk in the movieme back now , and she thought while her heels clicked on the pavementand this fellow 's footsteps , not quite grooved to hers , keptpace beside her , how does it pay off , what 's in it for me or for any ofThey were at her door now , in the entry , with names written andp196printed in the little slots above the bells surrounding them like people , all familiar names to Pam and all the names of strangers : Miss Kilkenny , Mr. and Mrs. Dian Body , Mr. Koslaysky , Elmer KirkwoodSanger .. . A thought went through Pam 's mind : the flight from home and then the war and lonely search and the work and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible benefit and handed her this fellow , Cliff . Maybe the war stopped with fellows like Cliff . Maybe he was the victory or maybe the two of them together , that might be the victory . " If you want to come up , " she said softly , " I could make you that cup of coffee . " 6 LEAVING Civic Center , now man and wife , Mr. and Mrs. Cliff Harper turned down Market Street . Here , in small soiled store fronts , interspersed with more imposing buildings , a succession of transient , hopeful enterprises bid for the diversion of the passersby  --  noveltycounters where souvenirs could be bought , pennants with the city 's name stitched on them , penknives that would n't cut , watches that would n't keep time , and so on . Also tattoo parlors , fortunetellers , slot-machine burlesque shows , treasure hunts among bubble-gum marbles , and places where one 's picture could be taken on a donkey or at the controls of a PYU or with one foot on a Gold Rush bar rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government issue could , and did , pay money to plink with .22 shots at moving ducks , clay pipes , and ping-pong balls sustained on jets of water . Once such establishments had done a rousing business , but recently trade had fallen off . Nobody wanted to play war with peace breathing down his neck . Barkers attired in the raffish jubilance of a lost boomtime cried their wares with a shrillness induced by desperation . " Have your picture taken , soldier ? You and the Missus on the biggest day of your life . " Cliff looked in a puzzled , inquiring way at Pamela . It baffled him to know how a dwarf with a huge camera slung on him could detect that his past included military service or that the girl with him had in the last hour become his bride . What he did n't realize was that the dwarf , catering almost exclusively to military personalities , had trained himself to recognize the type , or that Pamela was carrying in plain sight  --  in the easily identi/fled envelope  --  the marriage certificate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wise guy , " he said . " They see a lot of people , " Pamela said . They strolled on , but the hunchback kept along beside them with a waltzing , sidelong caper , already ramming a plate into the lopsidedbrown box of his camera . " You and her , soldier , " he said , " right on a train step . Leaving for your wedding trip . Two poses for a buck . Special to you , fifty cents . " " That kind of picture fades , I guess , " Cliff said in a low voice , not with complete conviction . The dwarf sensed success . He switched his attack to Pamela . " Two beautiful poses , lady . One for the memory book and one for the folks . " The bride probed Cliff with a look , rapid but penetrating . She said gently to the dwarf , " We 'll let you take the pictures , if my husband wants them . " Cliff 's expression relaxed . " We ca n't lose much for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fade , if you 're careful . " " Captain , " the dwarf said , jumping Cliff five grades and **28;1394;TOOLONG , " keep them in a slightly dark place , you can hand them down to your kids . That 's the train step . So you want an ocean liner , four bits more . " During the picture-taking Pamela posed beautifully , smiling her wide-lipped smile . She stood , once , on the bottom step of the sawedoffbit of fake train , leaning back against Cliff , and again at the rail of the liner because what could you lose for four bits more ? She was very happy . She had wanted the pictures . Having them taken was a proper feature of their wedding day . However , in spite of certain assurances , the touch of fingers and the quick looks with which she renewed for herself the reality of Cliff , she was gripped by nervousness . Not by the placing of a ring or taking pictures or even by makinglove did one person 's identity merge with another 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : who was who , and so on . It was usually the first step . Cliff , certainly , had seemed to think so . The first night he 'd told her about his dad 's death , the golf course , the Welfare Home , the paper route , the Dodge , the footballletter and the Marine Corps . But what did Cliff know about her ? When would she tell him and how would she tell him without making herself seem  --  as for a while she had once seemed even to herself  --  a freak of nature , an inheritor of nothing , a fake and ap198phony ? And tell him anything or  --  as she certainly would have to sometime  --  take him to California Street , where she was n't quite sure any longer whether she herself was welcome ? Cliff seemed absent-minded . As they left the photographer 's he still luxuriated in the wonder of the day . But he was thinking about something now . " Where are we heading , Mrs. Harper ? " he said at length . Pamela drummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift of a good saint . " I want you to see the house where I grew up . " She spoke with the bridge-burning decisiveness of one alluding to a shame , long-hidden , which was better owned up to now than later  --  a confession made in the manner of some brides and grooms who , on their wedding night , blast their own happiness by compellingtheir partners to read diaries recording their affairs with other people or disclose that until now they have made their living as spies . " Why , sure , fine , " Cliff said . " Let 's go there . What street did you tell me it was on ? " " California Street , " Pamela said . " Let 's grab a taxi . " " No , " Pamela said , already protective of their communal finances , " we do n't have to do that . We can just take the cable car , we 're almostat Powell anyway , and then walk . It really is n't far at all . " The cable car was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . When it started forward , Pamela and Cliff rode on the open seats , parallel to the tracks , sitting tight together ; they got off at the top of the hill and walked on with deliberation , the bridegroom watching the bride to see if he could tell , by her expression , when they approached her ancestral home . He could tell , all right . Her steps slowed down ; she looked long and searchingly along the block , then up at him . " There it is , " she said . She pointed at a house across the street , an opulent house  --  larger , more ornate than the other residences close to it , though these also were large and imposing . Cliff , hardly glancingin the indicated direction , nodded casually . His refusal to regard the house as a curiosity was part of an already proved inclination to accept as natural whatever she presented to him  --  even the idea of coming up Nob Hill on their wedding day to look at a house . " Quite some castle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limousine standing in the forecourt , the trunk lid raised as if to receive luggage.  | " Looks as if somebody 's home . " " It 's my father , " Pamela said ; " that 's his car . I do n't know if Mother Saxe is here or not ; I hope she is , though . Then you can meet both of them . " She had n't planned on this , the finality of confrontation , the three people most important to her in the world placed before one another . Just looking at the house could have been a preliminary step toward this , with the commencement of the actual relationship put off until another time . Suddenly , however , she could n't wait to have the meeting take place ; only when it had would her two worlds meet , the long process of her self-identification finally completed . " All right by me , " Cliff said . Arm in arm they entered the forecourt , crossed to the front door . Pamela felt in her handbag for the key she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . She did n't want to ring ; it would n't seem like a homecoming not to open the door . The chauffeur who belonged with the black car was nowhere to be seen , nor was there anyone on hand inside , where , over the stairs , the artificial constellations installed by Fabian Rupke stood fixed in their orbits , steadfast and changeless as the genuine , unseen galaxies in the sky . In the center of the hall were several suitcases . " I guess , " Pamela said tentatively , " Dad 's going on a trip . That 's what it looks like anyway . " She paused , composing a plan of action . " I tell you what , " she said , pointing to the library , " you go in there while I run upstairs and find out what 's what . " " Okay , " Cliff said . He peered with some apprehension into the large room , full of leather , books and studious gleams of light . " Only you better come back quick , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tosses me out in the street . " " When they start to toss you out , " Pamela said , " just show them this . " She handed him the marriage certificate . Then , with an encouragingsmile , she started up the stairs . REVIEWING her wedding day later , Pamela wished she 'd had a picture of the way Anchylus had drunk to her health and happiness , and to Cliff 's , the three of them standing in the library beside the tall brass champagne bucket with the neck of the magnump200sticking out of it and Reuben  --  the butler who had replaced Temple  --  in the doorway , watch in hand . They had that round and then another , and she and Cliff toasted Anchylus in return and wished him a good trip . Then it was time for Anchylus to go . He was leaving for New York on a business trip . Jessica was in Atherton . If Pamela and Cliff had come to the house a half hour later they would have missed him . Pamela had found him in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the morocco case of Sheffield straight razors , one for each day of the week , the bottle of bay rum she remembered from childhood , the monogrammed silver flask of brandy for his nightcap . He 'd put his hand over the mouthpiece of the telephone and looked up at her with the bearish look of love and ba l ement and wariness with which , for a long time now , he had greeted her arrivals . " Hi , baby , " he said , " what are you doing home ? " Pamela had stood before him suddenly shaking , wondering if everything was going to go wrong now , and said , " I got married this morning , Dad , to a wonderful guy . I brought him to see you . " Anchylus had n't properly ended his telephone conversation , whateverit had been . He had just hung up the phone . Then he had stood up and taken her in his arms . This was it , as far as he was concerned  --  the suspicion that she 'd gone over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen words . She had come home indeed if her first act on getting married had been to bring her husband to him . Not like Alexandra , fleeing over the mountains in the cold Sierra dawn . Not like Sharon , marrying a man he 'd asked her not to . He still had one daughter left , out of the wreck of things . If he were going to have one , this one might be best . Over all , she had cost the most , if you were going to rate daughters by any such measures as that . " Well , congratulations , " he said . Pamela held onto him . She knew something big had happened . Coming to the house had been exactly the right thing to do . She had n't planned it that way but that was how it was turning out . She was very glad she 'd come . " Thank you , Daddy , " she said . " Where is this character ? " Anchylus said . " Down in the library . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and meet him . " He 'd started out of the room with his arm around her , then turned back to tell Reuben to bring some champagne.  |p201Possibly  it had also been lucky that the only champagne Reuben had on ice had been a magnum of Veuve Clicquot . A magnum had a regal air about it . Also it was more than any three people could drink under ordinary circumstances , particularly if one of them had shortly to catch a plane . They had drunk all the proper toasts . Cliff , in Anchylus ' presence , had seemed younger than ever . As for Anchylus , the first clue that he really liked Cliff had been a suggestion he 'd made as they were all walking out to the car . " Look , why do n't you people make yourselves at home ? The place is yours  --  regular damned hotel , no charge . Cook off till Monday , but sure to be food somewhere if you look for it , I guess . " Pamela perceived the flattering nature of the invitation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cliff would want to do . " That 's awfully sweet of you , Daddy , but I do n't know . I 'm not sure that we can . " " Think it over , " Anchylus said imperiously , stage-managing the honeymoon . " Go back and finish the wine , anyway . It 's good wine . " " Thank you very much , sir , " Cliff said . " It is good wine . I had champagne once in the Pacific , but this is better . It 's the best wine I cver tasted . " This speech , like the champagne itself , buzzed in Pamela 's brain . When they were back in the library working on the considerable remnants of the magnum , she said suddenly , " Darling , how did you get champagne in the Pacific ? " " Made it , " Cliff said . " Navy compass alcohol the fellows stole . We made every kind of drink with it . For champagne we mixed it with cider . We had a sarge , he 'd been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , of course . " " This ought to be better , " Pamela confirmed . Then , her thoughts taking a new direction , she said , " Dad liked you . I know he did or he would n't have asked us to stay . " " Think so ? " Cliff said seriously . " I know it . " " Well , " Cliff said , " that 's okay then . " " Did you like him ? " " He 's a great guy . A real , bona-fide Wheel . " " She is , though I never think of that . I want you to meet Jessica . he 's terrific too . " " You call her Jessica ? Your mother ? " " I always called her Mother Saxe when I was with her , " Pamela said , " but in my thoughts I called her Jessica . Dad was never marriedp201to my real mother . I guess I never told you that . It was a romance . " " You 're kidding . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told you . I married you under false pretenses , in a way . " " The hell you did . " " Oh , yes , I did . I was afraid if you knew what I was you 'd walk out and leave me . " " You do n't even want to say the word , do you ? " " No , I do n't . I hate that word . " " Why you little  --  " " Do n't say it , Cliff ; I hate it . " " Ca n't I ever call you a little red-haired bas  --  " " Not on our wedding day . Besides , I 'm not . " " Yes , you are . You just said so . " " That 's how I started , but I was adopted . They adopted me by taking me to live with them . But you know when you were telling me about the Welfare Home ? Well , I was in a home too . My mother took me to one when she was sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you were talking about . I knew we belonged together before that , but that made it certain . " " Were you in the home a long time before they adopted you ? " " No , only a few days . But you know , every minute of those days I 've lived over in my mind . It 's as if they were still going on and the clock that measures them ticking off the minutes very slowly , each minute a month or a year , while the other clocks I live by go whirlingat the normal speed . I go back there when I dream . I start off from there . Not that being there was so terrible , but it became a hinge between two versions of me . I ca n't explain it . Do you know what I 'm talking about ? " " I guess so . Like me planning to go back and burn the other place down . So I could get rid of it . Only I guess the only way to do that would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you figure you 'll still go back there ? " " I do n't think so . When I met you I stopped needing the hinge . I slammed the door . But I 'm kind of an artificial person , all made up of little pieces , not what I seem at all . And timid , at least about some things . " " Everybody 's timid about some things . Everybody . " " Not you . " " I 'm no different . "  | " I could n't imagine you being timid about anything in this world . " " I was , though . " " In the Service ? " " I was plain scared to death in the Service , half the time . But that 's different from being timid . I was timid in the Welfare Home . They made you that way ; it was protection . If you did n't get timid you could n't stay alive . I was timid in Berkeley , too , in school . You know what of ? Being a teacher 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in handy , but I tried to let on I was n't . I had lots of fights about that . " " If you had fights , then you were n't timid . " As if this settled thediscussion , Pamela seated herself on her husband 's lap . After a fewmoments she said , " I guess I 'd better go back to where I was sitting . " " If you do , then this marriage is a total bust , a flop . " " Do n't say that . " " You 're mighty particular about what I 'm supposed to say . " " That 's the way brides are . They 're particular and they 're screwy because it 's the biggest day that will ever happen to them and I 'm the screwiest , most particular bride that ever lived . " " You 're only a bride on paper so far . We could still have it an-nulled . " " Want to ? " Cliff gave this some thought . " No , " he said . " Not right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yup . " " Good . Cliff , " Pamela said , " do you mind if I get just a tiny little bit plastered ? Not that I intend to , but do you mind if I do ? " " You ca n't get plastered on this stuff . It 's too mellow . " " Shall we send out for some compass alcohol ? " " Later , maybe . Let 's see if we get anywhere with this first . " " I 'm getting somewhere with it , " Pamela said . " I can feel everyswallow of it pulling up through me . Does it affect you that way ? " " Let 's go back to your apartment , " Cliff said . " Wait , " Pamela said , " not when we 're having a serious conversation . This is a conversation we should have had days ago , but all we did then was make love .

What I meant to say was , I 'm ashamed of telling you this , such an important thing about myself that way . " " What way ? " " Just letting it come out as if it was n't anything . I 'd had it planned exactly how I was going to tell you if you asked me a question about myself , but you never asked me a single question . " " You do n't have to ask questions , " Cliff said , " when you start out with the answers . " " And you 're still sure you do n't want it annulled ? " " I do n't want it annulled . " " I 'm terribly glad . " " What do you want to do now ? " " I want to get some more champagne , " Pamela said , " and then I want to show you the house , including the ballroom where my sister Alexandra and I made the most fantastic debut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I got myself a job selling hairnets . " " Have some more champagne , " Cliff said , " or wine , as your father would say . " " Did you really like him , Cliff ? " " Sure , I liked him , " Cliff said . " He 's a terrific guy . It was swell of him to suggest we stay in the house . " " Would you be very much against our staying ? " " Not if you 'd like to . Is that what you want to do ? " " It would kind of bring things together . If you 're sure you do n't mind . " " Any place is all right with me , " Cliff said . " Then we 'll stay , " Pamela said decisively .

Is that the kind of breakfast you want too ? " " Perfect , " Cliff said . " Just turn mine over easy . " THE FIRE they had lighted in the small marble fireplace glowcdsoftly in the room , its coals throwing an uneven , flawed glow onthe curves of the heavy mahogany and cherrywood furniture . Sometimes a knot in the coals would flicker up bright for a second , bringing into relief the cherubs holding up the mantelpiece and thep205wallpaper with its rose design and the slow curve of the bed 's footboardwhere the mahogany swelled into a pair of sleeping serpents . It was warm in the room . Through the walls there came the pulse of the city , locked out here . Time also was locked out . There were three clocks in the room , one on the mantelpiece with gilt shepherds and shepherdesses , a big wall clock , and another , a small gold one , beside the bed , but the first two did n't synchronize , and the gold one had stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mashed sideways on the pillow and her cheek and nose were pressed against Cliff 's shoulder . Now that she was awake , this position made it hard to breathe . She moved her nose an inch or so to one side , then swerved it pleasurably over a small area of her husband 's skin . Her eyes were open now . She had remembered where she was and with this memory came a quick jolt of happiness and triumph ; she tightened the muscles of her belly and pressed down on the bed as if to confirm its reality . If possession was nine points of the law the bed was hers , just as the husband was , though Jessica would hardly think so . She tried to picture how Jessica would look and what she would do if , by some chance , she walked in now . Carefully , taking pains not to wake Cliff , Pamela disentangled herself from his embrace . She slipped out of bed and crossed the room to where her clothes and his were piled in an amiable tangle ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate . This she unfolded . She propped it against the gold clock on the night table and got into bed again and lay looking happily at the piece of paper with the great seal of the City and County of San Francisco and the signature of the Judge and the names Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Harper . Well , she said to herself , I made it . Bastard or not , I 'm a statistic w , praise be to God . Oddly enough this matter of becoming a statistic was n't really as important  --  as it turned out  --  as the impulse which had brought her back to California Street . The reunion with her father , effected on her wedding day , was to be a source of strength to both of them in the series of events which later made the split-up of the Saxe familycause celebre in San Francisco.  |p209NICKY  was restless at the ranch . For a year he 'd seemed contentto school his jumping horses and play cowboy and make love toAlexandra , but early in 1946 he lost his peace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went down impatiently to the mailbox to wait for the answers to his letters and for the paper which came out RFD . When the paper arrived , he would sit on the terrace and read it gloomily , smoking cigarettes and shouting to Alexandra to bring him cups of coffee . His trouble was the Russians . They were n't behaving the way he wanted them to in Hungary . Also he was worried about his mother , who still lived there on the family estate near Lake Balaton . She was almost eighty years old . Her husband , Nick 's father , had been killed fighting for the Germans in World War I and her oldestson , Fefi , had been killed fighting against the Germans in WorldWar II . Then she 'd lost all but 150 acres of the estate when the land was partitioned by the Smallholders ' Government . She 'd had avery hard life and Nick felt she should have been excused fromp210further trouble but she was in for more of it now because of the Russians . Alexandra dutifully read the paper after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , not just Letty Meeker , the headlines , the White House and City of Paris and I. Magnin ads and the society news , as she used to . She read the reports from foreign countries more than once and memorized the pronouncements of George Catlett Marshall , so that she could use them in arguments with Nicky and thus appear intelligent in his eyes . Apparently , however , she might have saved herself the bother ; she did n't get the same impression from the reports or from General Marshall 's statements and notices that Nicky did . As far as she could see , the news was quite all right . Everything over in Europe was hunky-dory outside of some food shortages and some fussing about control zones and about elections . " But they have n't done anything too bad yet , have they ? " she asked Nicky , meaning the Russians . " They are showing their coalition sentiments , " Nick said . " What does that mean , Nick ? " Alexandra asked . " It means that when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said for his soul , " Nick said . " What 's wrong with shooting a collaborationist ? " Alexandra asked . " I thought this was open season on them . " " To a Russian , " Nick said , " any Hungarian of whom he is afraid is a collaborationist . Except those , like me , who were Resistance fighters . We are fellow Communists . Or so they think . " Alexandra could see that he was making plans . She was not disturbed but she wanted to be in on them . " Are you going to try to get your mother out , Nick ? " she asked him one day . Nick cocked one eye at her through a boil of cigarette smoke . Ile seemed amused by her question , but it was hard to tell . Because of a need to accommodate himself with the least possible trouble to a variety of social circumstances , often those which placed his own life at stake , Nick 's face was permanently set in an expression of sardonic amusement . If he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worn the same expression . It was almost impossible to tell whether he was laughing at you or not . " Of course , " he said . " Then I 'm coming with you , " Alexandra said . " Perfect ! " Nick said . " We will get passports . " " Will they be hard to get ? " " For you , an American , a passport is no problem , " Nick said.  | " What about you ? " Alexandra asked . " For me , a hero of the Resistance , only a very small problem . I shall talk to some friends of mine . Then we will see . " The first friend he had to talk to was a cousin who lived in Miami , Florida . Alexandra and Nick flew to New York and took the Orange Blossom Special to Miami . It was very hot in the train since the railroads were using their air-conditioned cars elsewhere , and you only had a choice of two entrees , both dull , in the diner ; but Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyedthe trip . She was happy being with Nick . She had bought a number of books in Brentano 's dealing with foreign affairs and so forth . However , most of the books did n't share Nick 's views on the character of the Russians but took a line more in keeping with the views of General Marshall , and Alexandra failed to get much out of them that would make her appear intelligent where Nick was concerned . Half the time she would sit with her book on her lap and stare out at the low-rolling , piny land and the red clay roads with old jalopies riding slowly over them and the small wooden houses with the tramped-down yards and the thin-legged , puffer-bellied children and old people , black , white or brown , standing big-eyed and solemn watching the train go by . In Miami it was very hot , being off-season . Alexandra and Nick went directly to the house of his cousin , Mrs. Ford . Mrs. Ford had left Hungary in 1939 . She was a rich woman , and to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a partner in an advertising agency with offices on Madison Avenue , New York . Mr. Ford seldom came to Miami , but Mrs. Ford remained in touch with him . I Ier main pastime seemed to be keeping in touch with people . She kept in touch with them all over the world and had helped a great many fellow citizens to leave Hungary before and during the Germanoccupation . She had continued working at this job during the Russians ' display of coalition sentiments , and Nick thought she mold help get him a passport of the kind which would not be limited to entering his native land . That , to a former hero of the Resistance , would have been quite simple , but for Nick there was ! so the problem of getting out and of getting his mother out. lexandra would , of course , get out ; she was an American , like Mrs. ord . The lawns of Mrs. Ford 's pink house rolled right down to the hannel . Here a few yachts were berthed for the summer , and on e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging over the es in boatswains ' chairs painting or standing on the deck smokingp212and looking at the shore . Mrs. Ford went swimming every day and had a wonderful tan and a very svelte figure , remarkable in a woman who was sixty if she was a day . Little gold specks floated in the bottom of her eyes like grains of sand picked up in the backwater of a clear green wave . She had a wonderful European-sounding laugh , " Tscha , tscha , tscha , " ending on an upward note . Her hair was blue . Men were mad about her , particularly an Italian who ran a gambling house down near the Causeway and who dropped in to see Mrs. Ford on his way to work , about 9:oo P.M. Gambling was the only kind of business besides yacht painting which went on in Miami off-season , but even this was n't doing too well . Mr. Pachetti , Mrs. Ford 's friend , explained that peace was ruining the people . He carried a pistol in a shoulder holster on the chance that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling operations . Mr. Pachetti would never have had his dinner when he dropped in so Mrs. Ford would let him finish the hors d'oeuvres left over from hers and give him a cup of coffee . No liquor . She said it was ridiculous to give hard liquor to Italians ; they never could hold it . She treated him rather badly . Alexandra would have liked to see his gambling house but Mrs. Ford would n't hear of it . No decent woman , she said , should set foot in a place of that type . She was very nice to Alexandra . She said she had always been afraid that Nicky would get hooked by some ugly , stupid woman ; your handsome , sporty men so often were . Mrs. Ford was glad that Nick , a true hero of the Resistance , had shown better taste . She looked fondly and gaily at Alexandra as she said this , and the gold grains stirred in the deep , lazy bottoms of her sea-green eyes . She put her arm around Alexandra , filling her nostrils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat , tscha , tscha , tscha . THERE WAS a great deal of telephoning and writing to be done about the passport . Mrs. Ford did the writing with a pen which had a number of small diamonds embedded in its shaft . Some times Nick was called to talk to someone she had contacted by telephone and he would talk in Hungarian , his voice leaping out deep and friendly , with a tone Alexandra had never heard in it before . At such times she knew that he was talking to one of the men whom Mrs. Ford had helped out of Hungary  --  usually someone with whomp213he had worked in the Resistance . Some people were discouraging about the passport ; others held out hope . Finally all possible contacts had been made and results promised . There had been nothing to do but wait . Mr. Pachetti invited the Drobnys and Mrs. Ford to go over to Havana as his guests , on board his boat , but Mrs. Ford said this was ridiculous  --  Mr. Pachetti'sboat was only good for fishing , it would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be seasick . So they went on the steamer . Alexandra was sick anyway but she enjoyed the trip . Just as they were getting close to Cuba a storm built up . Steep dark seas slanted out of a twilight-colored sky and the waves sent spurts of foam into the air as they smacked into the rocks below the lighthouse . The harbor itself was smooth and the sun poked through scoops of clouds and lighted up the white and pink and orange and cream-colored houses on the slopes above the water . Nick had been playing cards . He came out on deck in a silk tropical suit and a panama he had bought in Miami and he and Alexandra and Mrs. Ford and Mr. Pachetti stood at the rail while Mr. Pachetti pointed out Morro Castle and other landmarks . Mrs. Ford already knew them . She showed her boredom with Mr. Pachetti by contradicting him about details which he described . Now the ship was steady . It came on smoothly past the freighters at anchor and the line of fishing boats and the long wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Nicky 's arm and went down the gangplank feeling like a bride . Mrs. Ford took a room at the Nacional for Mr. Pachetti and a suite for Alexandra and Nicky . She herself planned to stay with some transplanted Hungarian friends , the Feris . Mr. Feri , a **28;1424;TOOLONG man , had been , like Nicky , a cavalry officer in Hungary . He belonged to a club out at Marianao where you could shoot live pigeons . Nick proved to be very good at this , as he was at all sporting activities . While the shooting went on a flunky in a white coat trundled around a cart from which whisky and rum drinks and beer were served and the members and their guests rank a good deal but Nick never touched a drop ; he was tootent on the shooting . He shot in the finals of that day 's go-roundainst a part-Irish Cuban named Domingo Nolan who had a withered arm and eyes so red from drinking they looked like balls f fire in his crook-nose , pale , tan face . He beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and explained apologetically that hed bet a thousand dollars on himself and had to have the moneyht away . Alexandra wrote the check and Mrs. Ford endorsed itd a boy went to cash it while they all had some more drinks . Thenp214Nick paid Domingo Nolan , but Domingo did n't even buy a round of drinks , being the kind of man who panicked when the check came around . Night crawled up out of the ocean and spread over everything , a tom-tom Cuban night , moist and fever-hot . Mr. Pachetti took them all on a tour of the rumba joints ending at the Callejon de Noche , where he got quite drunk . He was furious because a goodlookingCuban boy with tightly brushed black hair kept dancing with Mrs. Ford . The boy was part of the Callejon 's floor show and in the last act he turned out to be a girl and came out in spangled trunks doing a tap dance . He , or she , and Mrs. Ford later detached themselves from the party , and Mr. Pachetti was left to pay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he was going to kill the Cuban but Nicky got him calmed down and took him back to the Nacional to get some sleep . Back in the pink house in Miami there was a telegram waiting , saying Nick 's passport was okay . Nick had to pick it up in Washington . He was to travel as an attache of the Hungarian embassy , a status made possible because he had been in the Resistance . He thanked Mrs. Ford with tears in his eyes . That night they dined on the terrace in the black Florida night and Mrs. Ford served champagne to celebrate his passport . It was one of the nicest eveningsthey 'd had in Miami . Next day Mrs. Ford saw them off at the airport , and she cried when she said goodbye to Alexandra and gave her a big zircon dinner ring set with real emeralds . She said it was to remember her by . Alexandra did n't think there had been much to remember except the passport , but she let it go . She was very happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had always loved to travel and now she was going far  --  the farthest she had been yet from California Street. 3 ALEXANDRA and Nicky flew to Washington and Nick picked up his passport and Alexandra got one for herself , Brad Iverson helping to push it through . From Washington they went by train to New York and then took the Queen Mary to Cherbourg . Americans were just beginning to travel again . Paris was loaded with them , and the Champs d'Elysees looked like Market Street , with all the neon signs advertising U.S. products and the marquees with the names of U.S. stars on them . Alexandra did n't like it and kept away from Fouquet 's and the Ritz Bar because they remindedp215her of being so unhappy in Paris with Schuy Cutting , her first time around . She loved Vienna , though . She and Nick spent five days there , then took the Orient Express . There was no trouble about the passport anywhere , and they arrived at the Keleti Station in Budapest on a sunny August morning and went straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along a great boulevard beside the Danube lined with the ghostly shapes of hotels that had been bombed during the siege and never repaired . Budapest was dark compared to an American city , but it had a different kind of darkness . Overhead a million stars spread in a big , bright drift across the summer sky . It was a clear night , warm and still , and you could smell the river and hear the rustle of leaves , and on all sides you could feel the life of the old , mysterious city and see the reflection of its dim , old lights like golden dust on the night sky . Nick had many friends in Budapest . He kept pointing out their houses to Alexandra  --  some of these tremendous palaces , the upper windows often broken out and patched with boards and paper . To her surprise he did n't want to see the friends themselves . He explainedthat things changed . It was too hard to tell which of his friends were working for the Russians . Most of those he trusted had either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He felt like a stranger in Budapest and for the present he was satisfied to remain one : his main concern was to rent or buy a car so he could get to his mother . There were n't many private cars around , it seemed . All you could see were military vehicles and coalition jeeps decorated with the flags of four nations . In these jeeps French , English , Russian and U.S. soldiers rode around demonstrating the close governmental co-operation of the Four Nations , but when one of these coalition jeeps went by , Nick said unpleasant things . He still took no stock in coalition . Finally he rented a car , though one too small for all the baggage they had to load on it . Alexandra had to sit mashed up against the door with her dressing case and biggest suitcase in the front seat beside her . Nick relaxed as soon as they were outside the city . He lost some of his impatience to get to his mother and drove along slowly , telling Alexandra about the countryside and how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes and candy , and when he and Alexandra stopped in a village for gas , he handed out presents to the kids who crowded around the car . These Hungarian village kids were thin but healthy looking and they seemed happier than the kids Alexandra had seen standing in the tramped-down yards of the littlep216houses in the Florida and Georgia and Alabama woods as she rolled past in the Orange Blossom Special . The roads were good . Sometimes they were so overgrown with greenery that they were like tunnels or tubes through a world of soft green leaves . After traveling for a while in one of these green tubes the car would rush out into the sun and tear along between open fields fenced with stone walls . Nick would shout with joy . Sometimes he put his arm around Alexandra and sang songs in Hungarian , teaching her the words . When a shower caught them in an open space he would n't stop to put the top up . The big raindropsbounced around them like tennis balls and the wind bent the trees into witchlike shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamed and the trees dripped ; smells of leaves and grass and a feeling of lightness and goodness filled the air . They stopped at an inn and drank red wine and ate a fresh-water fish called fogas which tasted like salmon and came from the Lake Balaton , now only fifty miles away . Next morning they reached Nick 's mother 's house . He had written that they were coming , and his mother was expecting them and ran out on the steps to greet them . She kissed Alexandra on both cheeks and made an affectionate speech to her in Hungarian which Nick translated . The house was not as old as Alexandra had expected , nor was it constructed like a castle . It was made of wood , with bay windows and a lot of gingerbread scrollwork like some of the older houses in San Francisco . It stood on a hill above a cemetery . From all sides of it , on the banks of the hill , slanted rich , black land , planted with grapes . Nick 's mother looked more like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baroness . She had tough , wrinkled hands and sharp , ironic dark eyes with the same mocking , joking wrinkles around them that Nick had . She made a lunch of pepper steak and many kinds of homemade jam and slabs of light , flaky pastry . After lunch she took Alexandra upstairs and showed her Nick 's old room and his horseshow prizes and class pictures in cavalry school and a snapshot of him with his friends in the Resistanceand the stern , bearded man in the center of the picture , who was General Miklos . There were many closets in the house , one packed with stacks of hand-loomed sheets , tablecloths and pillow . cases and another containing a chest of silver service enough for a banquet of fifty , every piece heavier than sterling , and all stamped ; with the family crown . An old peasant woman who had been Nick 's nurse lived with his mother and helped with the housework , the twop217old ladies waiting on each other and quarreling about the way to do things , as they had no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the house as a bride some fifty years earlier . Late in the afternoon Nick took a walk down the hill to inspect the vineyard . Entering the kitchen later , Alexandra found him sitting in a wooden chair with his breeches rolled up , smoking a cigar and chatting happily while his old nurse washed his feet in a basin . Alexandra did n't ask when they were leaving or what the plans were about Nick 's mother . That was Nick 's department . She felt sure it would all come out all right . She would n't have minded if he 'd decided for them to stay where they were . She could picture herself , the young Baroness , living with her handsome husband and the old nurse , Luisa , and the little , bent , beautiful old Baroness in the narrow , dark house on top of the vineyard . She would spend her time sorting the linen and silver and eating delicious meals in the dark dining room , with the ironic , slanting faces of Nick 's Magyar ancestorslooking down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be pleasant in summer and in fall when the vines were stripped and the first storms came in and then in the winter when the snow brought peace and the peasants  --  surely there were still some peasants around  --  came to the house to sing Christmas carols . Did they sing carols in Hungary ? She knew they did in Germany . She made a mental note to ask Nick about this . It was all very satisfactory . She wrote Jessica and Sharon long letters about it , letting them know how different it all was from life on California Street . One evening after she and Nick had been in his mother 's house about a week , the old Baroness did n't come down to breakfast . Nick went up and spent two hours locked up with her in the bedroom . When he came down , he told Alexandra to pack the suitcases ; they were leaving . " What about your mother ? " Alexandra said . " Is n't she coming ? " " She 's decided not to , " Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she could remember , his eyes held no amusement at all . " Good God , Nick , " Alexandra said . " I thought she wanted to leave . Was n't that what she wrote you ? " " She 's changed her mind , " Nick said . " But why ? " " When it came to the point , " Nick said , " she just could n't do it . She says she 's lived here too long . She thinks it 's better if she stays . "  |p218Alexandra  could see how worried he was . " Jessica 's the same way , " she said . " I do n't think she 'll ever move . She 'll always live in California Street . " " It 's different for your mother , " Nick said . " Nobody will take her house away from her . She can live there until she dies . " " Will they take this house away ? " Alexandra asked , surprised . " I thought your mother could keep it . " " One never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing we can do about it . " " We can send her money , Nicky , " Alexandra said ; " at least there 's that . " " Yes , " Nick said , " there 's that . We can always send her money . " He brought the car up and loaded their bags on it . Luisa and his mother were both crying . They came out on the steps to say goodbye . Nick kissed Luisa and she gave him a rosary . Then he kissed his mother , and after kissing her he knelt down in front of her and she made the sign of the cross over him . She said goodbye to Alexandra most affectionately and with great composure . Nick helped Alexandra into the car , burrowing out a place among the piles of luggage . Before he got in himself , his mother ran down the steps to him and held onto him fiercely with her crooked old hands , as big as a man 's and hard as stones. 4 IN BUDAPEST Nick set about the job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The passports were issued and he got two second-class tickets on the Orient Expressfor the following Monday . The first-class tickets were all taken by Americans who had been in Budapest on business but were leaving because of strikes in the suburbs and rumors of trouble in the coming elections . On the sides of buildings and billboards in Bararos Square and on Dozsa Gyorzy Boulevard there were new posters of a square-shouldered man with thinning hair and bulbous eyes . This was Rakosi , Minister of the Interior and head of the National Police . Nick said he was a Russian stooge and that the Communists had him in training to be Premier . On their last night in the city Nick took Alexandra out to dinner . They went to a place in a cellar called the Candlelight Club , and here Nick met several friends . One of them was a former Resistance fighter named Gero Bern . He was plump and apple-cheeked , with a small mouth and twinkling blue eyes like a youthful , beardlessp219Santa Claus . He seemed particularly glad to see Nick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ czardas songs and bringing his own party over to Nick 's table . At first Nick behavedaffably , but he was drinking more than usual and Alexandra could detect that Bern 's friendliness annoyed him . " We must go , " he said to her several times , and each time she started to get up . But Bern would n't hear of their leaving . He had started drinking toasts . " To the new Hungary , " he said . Everyone drank the toast quite solemnly , including Nick . When it was over , however , he sat down and did his trick of gobbling up the glass . Alexandra thought that he was very funny , but apparently the trick was not considered in good taste by those present . Conversationlagged and there was a feeling of discomfort at the table until Nick and Alexandra finally got up once more . This time Bern made no effort to stop them . Nor did he shake hands with Nick . He sat staring right through Nick with his merry little eyes while Nick said goodbye to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter ? " she said . " Was he angry because you ate the glass ? " " To hell with him , " Nick said . " He seemed so glad to see you at first , " Alexandra said . " Regardless of what he seemed , " Nick said , " he has become a cop . He 's one of Rakosi 's men . " " How can you tell ? " " I can smell it , " Nick said , " but to hell with him . " " If he is a cop , " Alexandra said , " I 'm sorry you ate the glass . It really seemed to make him furious . " " Never mind , " Nick said . " We have the visas . There is n't a damn thing he can do about it . " A taxi at least twenty-five years old was coming down the street and Nick hailed it . As soon as they were in it he began to kiss her and she kissed him passionately in return , pulling his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy and the ezaida music still going through her head . Except for the wineglass incident , she thought later , they could n't have had a pleasanter last night in Budapest . Next day they arrived at the Keleti Station an hour before traintime . They were taking no chances on losing their places . Nick went to buy some cigarettes and Alexandra , with the porter who had ridden over with them from the hotel , was seeing to the luggage when a woman with a face like a bulldog came up to her and toldp220her in Hungarian that she would have to be searched . The porter translated this apologetically . Alexandra sent him to get Nick , who was standing by the tobacco stand talking to two men . " This woman is some kind of lunatic , " Alexandra said . " Nick , can you make her understand that we 've been cleared , we are taking nothing out , and I am traveling on a United States passport ? " Nick looked sick . ' White lines crawled like worms into his handsomeface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If she wants to search you , let her search you . As a favor to me . It will not take long . " When she got back after taking all her clothes off in a cold john-smelling room and letting the dog-faced woman go through her handbag , vanity case and suitcases , and also poke all over her with a hurting , shame-making rubber glove , Nick was outside with the two men . He was standing behind a chain-link fence which divided the train platform . He spoke through the fence while she stood on the other side , shivering . He said he would have to be in Budapest two or three days longer . He wanted her to take the train and wait for him in the Emperor Franz Joseph Hotel in Vienna . He would n't let her argue . He spoke roughly and impatiently through the mist-wet links of the fence . She could see that he was in some desperate trouble , but there was nothing she could do except obey him , since that was what he wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming to Vienna later , his personal luggage as well as hers having been placed on the railroad carriage . The last she saw of him , he was walking away with his long stride between the two men , both smaller than he , one wearing a felt hat , the other a derby. 5 BACK AT THE RANCH she tried to forget that night . The harder she tried , however , the clearer it became , in its nightmarish precisionof detail . It was not the sort of sight that you forget , particularly if it happened to be your final glimpse of your husband on this earth . Nor was it easy to reconcile the safe , effortless life in Sonoma with the events leading up to the disappearance of the Baron Nicholas Alexis Drobny . She had waited for him in Vienna for two months . She had gone twice a week to the Consulate to make inquiries , demands and protests . The Consulate advised her to take the matter up with the Hungarian Consulate . The Hungarian Consulate had nothing to say . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his influence with the State Department . He could tell them all the facts . A man had disappeared , six feet two , with joking eyes , a rider , a shooter , forty-two years old , married to an American woman . He had walked away one foggy morning with two persons encounteredat a railroad station . Anchylus talked to people of influence . He wrote letters and made a number of telephone calls . That much he proved to Alexandra when she returned to San Francisco . He showed her his memoranda on the subject and the copies of his correspondence . He had made an effort . There was no doubt of it . But yet  --  yet somehow the thought lurked in her mind that Anchylus had n't gone all out . This thought might have been inaccurate . She did n't know . Yet she felt that if his heart had been in it he would have come up with a miracle as he had done in the past when his own affairs were at issue . Anyway the thought persisted , and it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The State Department could n't act . The Hungarian Consul would n't . There was no reason to believe , he said , that the disappearanceof a baron was the result of Government action . Possiblythe Baron had enemies . Had Alexandra been in touch with the police ? Friends told her to go to Paris . There was rapprochement in Paris . Everything went more easily there . However , in Paris all the answers were the same . Only one individual shed any light . This was the Embassy Counselor , not to be confused in any manner with the Consul . The Counselor was a man who advised the Ambassador on protocol and so forth , keeping him in step , as it were . Alexandra was referred to him by Embassy officials , as a means of keeping her out of their hair and because , when you came down to it , her husband 's case was an inter-embassy affair . The Counselor looked like a Peter Arno drawing . He had a blankstaring , courteous , old-man 's face with lecherous , popping eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled Alexandra was sure he had it clone at a beauty parlor . After kissing Alexandra 's hand he sat clown stiffly in a straight chair opposite and came at once to the heart of the matter . " Was your husband at any time a member of the Communist party ? " " He hated Communists , " Alexandra said , surprised . " But he could once have been a member of the party , could he not ? " the Counselor asked  | " I suppose so , " Alexandra said ; " though if he had been , I would think he 'd have mentioned it . " " Nevertheless , " the Counselor said , " he might not have mentioned it . He might not have wished to . " " No , " Alexandra said , " he might not have considered it important . I 'm sure he was n't actively a member , though , if that 's what you mean . But why do you ask , m'sieur ? " It seemed appropriate to call the Counselor m'sieur , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a Resistance fighter , you have told me , " the Counselor said . " Many such men became party members . The party was the best-organized force working against the Germans during the Occupation . When the party created its own Occupation , in a military sense , the Resistance people renounced it . The party did n't care for such defections . A number of cases have come to our attention  --  cases in which the party sought to reassert its discipline , sometimes quite drastically . " " I see , " Alexandra said . " You understand , " the Counselor said , " I am merely trying to arrive at an explanation . I am sorry I ca n't be of more help . " Alexandra discussed the Counselor 's idea with several people . Some of them thought it made sense ; others upheld her own opinion , namely , that it was ridiculous . Nick was a Magyar aristocrat and a landowner . Resistance or no Resistance , what would he have had in common with the Com-munists ? If you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to believe he had been made to disappear because he 'd eaten a wineglass in a public place . Only once did she have direct word bearing on Nick 's fate . This was early in 1948 , when a man with a thick Hungarian accent telephoned from San Francisco asking if he could come out to sec her at the ranch . He said he had some information which might be of some interest to her . Alexandra felt reluctant to have him come to Sonoma . She arranged to meet him in the city . He turned out to be a boy about nineteen years old who had recently made his escape from a Communistlabor camp . When first arrested in 1946 he had been held in the AVH Headquarters on Balaton Street , Budapest , where Nick Drobny had been one of his fellow prisoners . Nick had told him about having an American wife and about his life in San Francisco . Before the transfer of Alexandra 's informant to the labor camp Nickp223had been executed in the basement of the AVH building . The charges against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was an American industrialist agent , a Fascist spy and a Trotskyite saboteur . Alexandra wrote regularly to the old Baroness . At first she receivedanswers , but after a while these stopped and she lost touch with her . It had not proved practicable to send her money , with any assurance that she was getting it . In 1948 Letty Meeker published the following item : There are rumors from Hungary that Alexandra Saxe CuttingDrobny 's second husband , the COMMUNIST , has been HANGED aS a traitor to his country. 6 LETTY 'S DISPARAGEMENT , no matter how vindictive , could n't alter one fact : Alexandra was a genuine International Belle . Many San Francisco families , it was true , had produced InternationalBelles , but no family after World War II had produced one as indubitably proven . Alexandra had done the European Bit twice  --  once with Schuy and once with Nick ; she was still beautiful and she had a title . In some cities ( more sophisticated or less lively , depending on one 's point of view ) these facts might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of significance . Furthermore , Alexandra 's new status was all the more engaging in that it included both mystery and tragedy and in that she seemed to attach no importance to either . She spent most of her time in the country . And she lived alone . Relatively alone , that is . A woman conditioned to a full , active existence could n't resign herself to complete loneliness , regardless of her state of mind or the pleasure she took in the homespun activities on a ranch . There were times when , since no other company offered , she went out with men who would have bored her badly a few years earlier ; she felt that what she did was her own business and that althoughcountry living might be dull at times , it had the compensationof being inconspicuous . The ranch was , in a way , a legacy from Nick , as was her taste for outdoor pleasures . She helped brand , dehorn and castrate her own cattle : sometimes she was in the saddle eight or nine hours a day with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dramatize what she did : it was hard work , and if she occasionally went out withp224a cowboy , it was not because she found cowboys glamorous . She had always felt contempt for women who , after a spell in the sagebrush , took up with its denizens  --  chic , perfumed women with grown children and $50,000 a year in alimony . None of that for her . She was both infuriated and disgusted by an item of Letty 's which ran in The Day in January 1949 , just when she had been thinking that Letty had forgotten all about her . NUMBER THREE for the beauteous Baroness Drobny may be a Sonoma County brand inspector . Can such things be ? " Zan " Drobny , in spite of her unfortunate marriages , always seemed to shimmer in the tradition of the renowned Daisy Fellowes or England 's Lady Duff-Cooper . But a BRAND INSPECTOR ! Ye Gods ! Say it is n't so ! Alexandra did n't linger over the paper . She proceeded into a bedroom where the curtains were still drawn and a sleeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed until she achieved a positiondirectly over that at which it could be presumed the sleeper 's head lay . She bent down toward the sheet and spoke into it ; she spoke loudly , considering the fact that her voice did n't have to carry more than a few inches . " Coley , " she said , " I want you to get up . I want you to get up and I want you to get out of here . " 7 ALEXANDRA rarely cleaned her own house . That job fell to Manuela Mena , a Mexican woman who lived in town and came out three days a week . This was n't one of Manuela 's days but it had been borne in on Alexandra powerfully , even before Coley was out of sight , that the place needed doing up . She wanted it scrubbed , vacuumed , aired and polished  --  not sometime later but right now . To have a tidy house , thoroughly put to rights , could be a great comfort . Taking the breakfast things from the table , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the liquor bottle  --  even sniffingit without the least temptation to take a drink . From the kitchen she bustled into the living room , dusting and sweeping , the sleeves of her striped riding shirt rolled up to the elbows . Women , she thought , did n't seem to realize what pleasure there was in sweeping ;  |p225it  was so much more satisfactory than vacuuming , and with no gadgetsto mess with . Instead of messing with gadgets you fought the dirt hand to hand . You called it out of hiding and stood it up in front of you . Then you pitched into it and destroyed it . How could she have let things get in such a mess ? She rushed out to fetch furniturepolish . Somehow the rings left by glasses on the night table must be gotten off . It was ridiculous , but she 'd hardly ever looked into her own linen closet : she even had trouble remembering where it was . Once located , however , the closet 's store of monogrammed pillowcases , towels , cloths , spreads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed made . After an hour of hard work , the room looked quite presentable . Alexandra sat down and studied her sweaty , dust-grimed face in the bedroom mirror . Suddenly , for no reason , she burst into tears ; she hurried to the liquor cabinet and poured out half a tumbler of bourbon , which she drank straight . She felt a little better . She could n't imagine what was wrong with her , why she had exhausted herself like this . She took another drink , a smaller one this time . Her pain was now smoothing out , her violent tensions relaxing . Returning to the bedroom , she took off her clothes , dumped them in the middle of the floor , quite heedless of the passion for tidiness which had obsessed her all morning ; lightheartedly she ran into the bathroom and turned on the water in the stall shower as hot as she could stand it ; she slid under the needling jets of spray , lathering her body , gasping with pleasure , at peace for the first time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off this time . Letty Meeker was his fault because he let her write whatever came into her head , no matter whom it hurt . Letty had counted on that . The insolent , lying bitch ! She thought she was untouchable . All right ! The moment had arrived to test that theory . Either the family meant something or it did n't , and if it meant anything it meant that Letty was through . Fini ! She had gone too far at last . Alexandra got out of the shower . Without waiting to dry herself , she dragged the telephone on its long cord into the bathroom and called her father 's office . " Miss Wilke , " she said , not sure whether it was Miss Wilke or the other girl who answered , eager only to get her mission accomplished before her determination weakened . " This is Alexandra Drobny . I have to see my father right away , Miss Wilke ; it 's really important . Will he be there this afternoon ? Because I 'm driving into the city and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there . "  |p226SHE  HAD NO PLAN for the interview : she 'd simply put it to Anchylusthat he had to fire Letty . Either that or  --  But her imaginationhad n't reached beyond the basic demand . It was difficult to conceive what excuse he could invent for refusing . Suddenly she realized that she was hungry ; she 'd had several drinks and hardly any breakfast . A good lunch , with perhaps one cocktail , two at the most , would brace her up for what lay before her . She went to Jack 's , ordered some food , and sent the waiter out to see if he could get a copy of The Day . It might be a good idea to have Letty 's item with her ; chances were that Anchylus had n't read it . He always claimed he read everything in the paper , but she did n't see how this was possible . With the objectionable paragraph in hand she could simply plunk it down in front of him and ask what he was going to do about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Alexandra was  --  as she 'd expected to be  --  one of the few women in the place . At lunchtime Jack 's was like a men 's club , each group with its special tables  --  Louis Lurie 's bunch at their table near the door , and gradingdown from this , in a broadening money pyramid , the MontgomeryStreet crowd , the advertising boys , the law cases which had adjourned from the Hall of Justice . She had finished her second Manhattanand was attacking a broiled chicken and a heartening bottle of Krug Traminer when a man on his way out stopped at her table ; she found herself looking up at the well-filled-out frame and friendly , suave , pink face of Timothy Wilkins III . Tim waved goodbye to his own lunch companions and seated himself across from her . " It 's been too long , Zan , " he said by way of greeting . " It certainly has , " Alexandra said , " but you know , country life can pin you down . I 'm just a ranch woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Tim said feelingly . " We 've missed you around these parts . " " I 've missed you too , Tim , " Alexandra said . " How are you , sweetie ? You look wonderful . How 's Sophy and the wee ones ? " Tim had married Sophy Suell  --  rather indecently soon , Alexandra felt , after her own elopement with Schuy Cutting . She would have been more flattered if a man who had proposed to her at least a dozen times had waited a normal interval  --  say , a year or so  --  before tying himself for life to someone else . Still , Sophy was a good matchp227and very sweet and they had a slew of cute children , she 'd heard ; she did n't know exactly how many . " Oh , fine , just fine , " Timmy Wilkins said , " all fat and sassy . What 's all this I read about a new romance for you ? Or is that one of Letty 's charming fictions ? " " It 's a most uncharming lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , of Letty . I suppose you realize she 's hated me for years . That must be fairly obvious . " " Do you know , I 've always thought she was an unpleasant woman , " Tim said . " That 's the understatement of all time , " Alexandra said . " She 's a killer . If you want to know why I came down today it 's expressly because I 'm going to Father . I 'm going to demand that he fire her . " Tim whistled softly . " Lots of luck , " he said . " I 'm going to need it , " Alexandra said , " but that 's what I 'm going to do . I thought you might be interested . " " Not only interested , " Timmy said , " absolutely fascinated . I wish I could be there to see the fur fly . " " I wish you could , " Alexandra said . " I could use some support . I 'm terrified , Tim , is n't that silly ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and yet I 'm scared to death . " " I 'm betting on you , baby , " Tim said ; " give ' em hell . " " I will , " Alexandra said , " but , of course , Letty is just part of it . The real person to beat is Anchy . And I do n't have to tell you about him . " " A crocodile , " Tim said . " An absolute dinosaur . " " You 're so right , " Alexandra said . " Last of his kind , " Tim said . " The species disappeared when they brought in the railroads . Huntington , Crocker and that bunch  --  he belongs with them . I 've studied the old boy a little on my own account . I know . " " Well , " Alexandra said , " I have nothing to lose but my brains . And the worst of it is I know just what will happen . He 'll be so polite , so sweet and fatherly . He 'll say the item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'll promise to bawl Letty out , and probablywill . And everything will go along just as before till the next time she feels like taking a poke at me . The only real , honest-togoodnessway to throw her out would be to throw Anchy out first . And that 's something nobody is going to do for some time . " " If ever , " Timmy said . " He 's rather safely entrenched , would n't you say ? " " Safely , " Alexandra said , " but not perfectly . I 've given a lot
