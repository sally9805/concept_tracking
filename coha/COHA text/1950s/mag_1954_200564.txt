Relations between the Western allies are at one of their low postwar points . What unity there is was born of irresolution rather than resolution , of recognition of common danger rather than agreement on common action . <P> In Britain , the very failure of U.S. plans for " united action " brought a sense of relief . The Times of London was notably pleased , and seemed to have made a discovery for itself , to wit , that the Americans are not wicked warmongers , after all . <P> " One immensely important factor which has been all too often ignored in recent years seems at last to have come into its own on Capitol Hill , " pontificated the Times . " American opinion , in spite of the cold war , in spite of its profound antiCommunism , is still firmly pacific , and , far from straining at the leash , will fight only when all reasonable chances of negotiation have failed . Peace is still , as in Jefferson 's day , the American people 's passion . . . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party cries . " <P> In better-informed publications there was recognition that Britain had also contributed its bit to confusion among the allies . The weekly Spectator blamed equally " Mr. Dulles ' tendency to underestimate the diplomatic difficulties of a strong policy , President Eisenhower 's unwillingness to give a courageous lead , " and " Sir Winston Churchill 's determination to stake everything on high-level international meetings , the unwillingness of the British government to back the undoubtedly clumsy but fundamentally sound basic American policy of firmness in the face of all Communist maneuvers . " <P> In Western Germany , dismay at the U.S. performance touched off a spate of statements urging direct negotiations with the Russians . In the German view , Dulles went to Geneva with both hands tied behind his back by Congress , and left looking like the small boy who takes the bat and ball home because he is not allowed to pitch . Wrote TIME 'S Bonn correspondent : " The U.S. is Bonn 's godfather ; Bonn expects it to lead the infant Federal Republic out into the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In India , officials were rosily pleased to see the U.S. forced into a secondary role at Geneva . Nehru told his Parliament that a real model for Asian agreements was his new pact with China , in which India meekly accepted the Red Chinese conquest of its northern neighbor , Tibet . Nehru made clear to those who had missed the point over the years that India was not ready to join any alliance to resist Communist expansion . <P> But in strongly anti-Communist Hong Kong , Formosa and Korea , there was concern that the U.S. was hobbled by its own allies in talking of a European-based Asian alliance or one including India , Indonesia or Burma . In their view , the U.S. should base Pacific defense on smaller but more enthusiastic allies : South Korea , Formosa , Thailand , the Philippines . <P>
