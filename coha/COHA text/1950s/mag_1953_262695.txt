TRUCE TALKS Agreement This week , seemingly beyond reasonable doubt , a Korean armistice was imminent . The U.S. had outlasted South Korea 's Syngman Rhee in the battle of wills . And the Communists appeared so tremulous for a truce that their anxiety stood out on them almost visibly-like drops of sweat . <P> Dwight Eisenhower 's troubleshooting Assistant Secretary of State Walter Robertson published a joint statement with Rhee. in which the substance of agreement was hidden under an amiable flow of words . Apparently this was done to save Rhee 's face , i.e. , to screen the manifest fact that he had been backed down . Excerpts : " Our two governments are in agreement in respect to entering into a mutual defense pact , negotiations for which are under way .
