txt A new business concept  --  giant corporations joining to form large combines for spreading their risks  --  may be developing on the economic scene , Roger M. Slough , chairman of United States Steel Corp. , said in an address before the Economic Club of Chicago . " Our biggest corporations are rapidly getting too small to do all of the things that . are expected of them , " said Mr. Slough . " The development of raw materials , for instance , has become so expensive , and involves such risks , that a number of large steel companies have had to band together to develop far-away iron ore deposits , and to establish plans and processes for the manufacture of usable blast furnace materials out of low grade taconite ores . " Mr. Enough also called attention to other fields , , such as the titanium industry , atomic power development and oil undertakings where risks are so great that even giant corporations are n't big enough to assume those risks alone . He suggested that business , , which evolved from the individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now may be moving into an era of partnerships of corporations . Even Bigger Organizations " Does this Joint development idea , perhaps , presage the birth of even laiger Joint ventures in busineSs enterprise than our present day organizations " he asked The future may indeed call for bigger busi- ness organizations as man seeks to unlock the secret of the atom . penetrate outer space , and harness the rays of the sun . he said . " I know one thing , " said Mr. Slough , " the future is not for little men with little minds . . . It is not for those arch reactionaries who seek to shatter big enterprise and to force American industry back into the puny production patterns of its Nineteenth Century infancy . " The U. S. Steel executive emphasized that big business has been developed to meet .. he needs of the American people and that . the people can regulate or even destroy a business simply by withholding patronage should that business be operated against the interests of the people .

Life in a Goldfish Boni " Big business lives and works in a goldfish bowl , where all the world can . watch it , mostly because the informed expect that of big business . " said Mr. Slough . In some areas such as research , bigness is necessary in or der to progress , he said . " Small business , as a whole , has neither the manpower nor the money to support the broader programs of basic research in the fields of fundamental and applied science , " he said . " Its limited resources must be devoted to the manufacture and sale of its product " Nevertheless , industry in general has been expanding at a faster rate than have individual large concerns , he said , so big companies represent a diminishing segment of the total economy .
