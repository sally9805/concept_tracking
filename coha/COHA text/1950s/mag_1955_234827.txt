As board chairman of Allied Stores Corp. , the world 's biggest department-store chain ( 72 stores in 24 states ) , B. Earl Puckett logs 100,000 miles a year in his private DC-3 , uses much of the mileage to scout likely locations for super shopping centers . On the ground last week Puckett unfolded the latest results of his high flying : he plans to build a $238 million network of seven new centers ( in addition to three already built ) , each dominated by an Allied outlet . Said Puckett : " The largest single expansion in the history of retailing . " <P> The new centers , scheduled for opening by 1957 , are designed to serve regions ( i.e. , customers within 40 minutes ' driving time ) rather than smaller suburban areas . The first to go into operation will be the $30 million Bergen Mall at Paramus , N.J. , expected to be the biggest U.S. shopping center . Puckett estimates that there are 1,588,000 customers within the 40-minute radius . <P> To lure them in , the center will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Puckett estimates will gross $2,000,000 a week . Added attractions : an auditorium seating 500 ( for auto shows , square dances , etc. ) , two six-storied office buildings ( one for doctors and dentists ) , several restaurants , a " Kiddieland , " an outdoor ice-skating rink , bowling alleys , a carillon . <P> The other six regional centers will be built at Peabody , Mass , ( near Boston ) , Cincinnati , Minneapolis , Levittown , Pa. , Houston , and somewhere on Long Island . Allied will finance a fourth of the centers ( including Bergen Mall ) , expects that insurance companies and local realtors will furnish capital for the others . To help pay for its part in the huge venture , Allied last week asked the Securities &; Exchange Commission 's permission to issue some $16.5 million worth of common stock ( 300,000 shares ) .
