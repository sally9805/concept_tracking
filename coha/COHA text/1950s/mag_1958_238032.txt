THE HEART OF INDIA ( 332 pp. ) - Alexander Campbell-Knopf ( $5 ) . <P> <P> What is India ? By the judgment of the Indians themselves-from Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru down to an unemployed factory manager in Gwalior-it is an empty tomb , a looted dustbin , the shadow under the lamp ; it is four parts filth and one part hypocrisy , a cow-dung country inhabited by people with a cow-dung mentality . Cries one Indian youth : " There 's no depth of superstition to which Indians wo n't sink . We worship cows and cobras . We have eight million ' holy men , ' most of them naked and all of them mad . Everything of any value was taken long ago by the conquerors .. . They took the strength from the soil , the virtue from the women , and the will power from the men . The gold is gone , the jewels gone , nothing is left but hones and a bad smell . ' <P> Leeches &; Tigers . This despairing India is not the only one seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 18-month correspondent 's hitch in India and Pakistan for TIME ( and now covers Japan ) . But it dominates a highly personalized book that makes bitterly clear how far Indian intentions outrun Indian performance , how even the monuments and pastimes of the imperial past are decayed in the ineffectual present . The Taj Mahal is here , naturally by moonlight-but so are the leechlike guides , making the night hideous as they clamorously offer to show visitors around for 10 rupees-or to go quietly away for 5 . There is a tiger hunt , but also its backstage management : the twelve-year-old boys , armed with clay hand grenades loaded with gunpowder , whose job it is to flush the frightened cats from their grass-filled ravine . Vividly , Author Campbell makes the reader experience the suffocating , insect-filled heat of India , the pervasiveness of religion and sex-often in combination-the desperation of the poor and the rapacity of the rich . <P> Forbidden Temples . In this sort of land all but a handful of the most fervent idealists turn cynical , and only Communists consistently rejoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who once dreamed that independent India would be " a decent country where decent people can live in decency and some dignity , " now says : " I shrug ; I laugh ; I work . What else is there to do ? ' ' Campbell traveled with Vasagam. another government agent , who was trying to implement the Gandhian ideal of equality for the untouchables . In a typical village he saw the higher castes stand sullenly by as Vasagam led untouchables into temples and restaurants . The next day he also saw that all utensils touched by the untouchables were cast away and broken , all places they had entered were scrubbed with milk and purified . Campbell agrees with Vasagam 's sighing comment : " We Indians are a remarkable people . "
