Ever since Poet Archibald MacLeish 's version of the Biblical Book of Job , the verse-play J.B. , opened on Broadway last December ( TIME , Dec. 22 ) , viewers and reviewers have been choosing up sides to attack and defend MacLeish 's Biblicism or lack of it , his humanism or his sentimentality . <P> " Incredible " Job . The Christian Century 's drama critic , the Rev. Tom F. Driver , who also teaches Practical Theology at Manhattan 's Union Theological Seminary , criticized MacLeish for making his play a non sequitur by jumping down from the theological discussion between God and Satan to dwell upon J.B. 's purely human sufferings . <P> In a later issue of the Century , Samuel Terrien , professor of Old Testament at Union , maintained that MacLeish 's J.B. is an entirely different character from Job . The Bible 's Job " shouts his pride , shrieks his blasphemy , and fights with a God who eludes his attacks . " By comparison , Terrien finds MacLeish 's J.B. " emasculated . " He is merely " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever at all , rises above the level of intellectual stupor and spiritual impassivity . " <P> Terrien 's and Driver 's academic boss , President Henry P. Van Dusen of Union Theological Seminary , took them both to task in the Christian Century for not taking into consideration the fact that the Book of Job is not one book but two-a poem with a prose introduction and conclusion on a much lower level . Since the picture of Job is not consistent in the first place , says Van Dusen , Dr. Terrien 's complaint that J.B. is not faithful to the Book of Job is irrelevant . Instead of " slavish imitation " of the Biblical Job , " Mr. MacLeish authentically sets forth the response of a very modern man to substantially parallel adversities . And again , his J.B. is far more convincing , as he is certainly vastly more moving , than the incredible Job . " <P> " Loving " Job . In the current issue of the Century , Poet-Playwright MacLeish speaks out for himself . Whatever the opinions of scholars about the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes it as a whole . The prologue in heaven is to him supremely important . Why , he asks , does God deliver the innocent Job into Satan 's hands ? <P> " Because , " he answers , " God believes it will be demonstrated that Job loves and fears God because He is God and not because Job is prosperous . . . that Job will still love God and fear him in adversity , in misfortune , in the worst of misfortunes-in spite of everything . . . Which means that in the conflict between God and Satan , in the struggle between good and evil . God stakes his supremacy as God upon man 's fortitude and love . Which means , again , that where the nature of man is in question . . . God has need of man . . .
