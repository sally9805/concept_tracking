txt since early October many Americans have been thinking about the problem of Hungarian refugees . For more than ten years we have been concerned with the problem of refugees from Communist tyranny . For more than twenty years we have tried to deal with the prob1 ; ens of refugees from Hitler 's tersm . For several thousand years mankind has been trying to find ways to provide safety for those who are in search of refuge . Each separate problem is dramatic in its own way . There were the p- , iful refugees from the Manchurian border back in 1929 who died by the thousands in the railway yard at Tsitsihar . There were the millions of North Koreans who streamed south across the " Parallel " to escape the Communists . There were more than a million Vietnamese who fled their homes in Tonkin and Annam to seek safety in the South . There are , at the present time , 900,000 Arabs who have been " displaced " in. the Middle East . And few refugee situations have been as awesome as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Pakistan who were truly refugees , on one side or the other . In every one of these cases there is a driving force . It is deadly fear . In every one there is a goal of hope , ultimate safety . These emotions and these drives are probably as old as man himself . Even in the early Biblical times there were set up the " Cities of Refuge " to which persons could flee to seek sanctuary from what was the equivalent , at/ that time , of lynch law . There were refugee communities in the Roman times which sought the security of Roman law and Roman citizenship . King Alfred the Great was the leader of " refugees " in Wessex . Throughout the Middle Ages men fled again and again to what they hoped was safety . Even here in the United States we have known our share . We call ourselves a nation of pioneers , and that is true . We are also a nation of refugees , While many of our grandfathers and great-grandfathers came to this country in the dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were also thousands who fled to these shores to escape from conditions elsewhere that they found to be intolerable . Some were political refugees . Many were religious refugees , trying to escape from societies in which their freedom of worship was inhibited . Even more were economic refugees , determined to fly from an existence that held too much of hardship and too little of hope . What all of them sought was a place of safety of one sort or another . The dangers of the wilderness could be braved . It was safe in comparison with what had been left behind . With such an ancestry there is reason for us to be peculiarly sensitive to these localized refugee problems as they arise from time to time and from place to place . Sometimes that sensitivity is not sufficiently apparent , but it must be part of our inheritance . More than that , it is part of the whole body of ethical concept that is shared by a large part of mankind . In spite of cynicism , of materialism , of greed , selfishness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every country , race and background , has the basic idea that men are brothers . Out of this belief comes the feeling that those who are in need - must be helped , that those who are in peril must be saved , that those who seek refuge must be sheltered . - This puts a heavier burden , perhaps , upon those people and those communities that are better fitted to give this help and shelter . They can least afford to be cold-hearted because they have the more to give , and to share . It is no accident-that the United States should have been looked upon through the years as such a great place of refuge . Most Americans are proud and happy that their country could have played such a role . Those who have sought harshly to limit it , or even deny it , do not , we believe , represent the true temper of this people . But because this is and will continue to be a world-wide problem it is fitting that a major part should be played by a world-wide organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can do more . The responsibilities of those who are safe toward those who seek safety have not yet been discharged . We , can not approach another Christmas season in good faith and warm heart without being aware of this important obligation .
