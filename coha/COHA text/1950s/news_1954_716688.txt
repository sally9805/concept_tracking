txt Sir Win-1 ston Churchill warned the Western world today against incautious or unprepared advances in international affairs , The future is likely to be ' " harsh and stony , " the Prime Minister said in a speech at Bristol , and " terrible pitfalls " await , the nations " if they allow themselves to advance incautiously and are unprepared or make grave errors . of judgment , " There was no mention of the ' Soviet Union in this part of his speech , But Sir Winston 's warning is interpreted in some official circles as , an attempt to damp enthusiasm for an early meeting with the Russians . A similar interpretation is being placed by some observers on the passage in the Prime Minister 's Woodford speech on Tuesday , recalling how he had asked Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery late in the war to stack captured German arms because they might be needed to rearm the Germans against the onrushing Russian armies . This paragraph started the Laborites out on the trail of Churchill the " warmonger . " Goaded by the Bevanites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the remarks in the next Parliament , especially , as the Opposition aeknowledges , it short of issues at the moment . The organ of the Labor party , , The Daily Herald , asserted in a front page editorial : " The Prime minister is a broken reed as a negotiator for peace . The Russian ; even if wrong , will never believe his sincerity in any fourpower talks . " The Daily Mirror , another powerful voice on the Left , considered Sir Vinston 's " unparalleled blunder " in the same* light and declared that it justified ' that newspaper 's campaign for his early retirement . " He should go before he further embarrasses his chosen sue* , cessor as Tory Prime Minister , Sir Anthony Eden , " said The Mirror in its front-page editorial , Maj. Gen , Sir Edward Spears , a Churchill associate in the two World Wars , said today that " the whole thing is absurd " and that The Times of London , which led the initial attack On the ' Prime Minister , " is behaving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia . " , ' " Nit Hitler was out of business and what the Prime Minister was doing was taking ' sensible precautions to be in a position to act if the Russians went too far , " General Spears added . There is a tendency toward appeasement of the Soviet Union today similar to the appeasement of Hitler before World War II , General Spears said . . " I think people of common sense will support the Prime Minister , who is fully aware that the Russians are guided by realistic considerations and not by words , " General Spears added . " I am absolutely convinced that Churchill knows exactly on what terms we can live at peace with Russia , " Sir Edward concluded . " We , the contemporaries of the greatest Prime Minister this country has : ever had , - must stand by him . " Party Circles Concerned Although the Conservatives are rallying fast to their leader , some concern is evident in party circles . This is not because of any disagreement over Sir Winston 's words but because of a realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a whole for talks with the Soviet Union , The Prime Minister may be right , it is said , in trying to discourage this by pointing out the potential danger of . Soviet ambitions to this . country , past and present , and by stressing the penalties of hasty action . But it is felt that if the Russians seize on the Prime Minister 's words as a reason for delaying or even avoiding a conference , ? both Sir Winston and the Conservative party will suffer . . British gratitude for Russian resistance in World War II was great . Anti-communism in the post-war period , although strong , has never been so pervasive or so vehement as in the United States . Sir Winston was cheerful at Bristol when the students of the university , of which he has been Chancellor for a quarter of a century , presented him with a silver ? salver . He thanked them for doing it on a day " when , if you look at the papers , I am supposed to be in a bit of a scrape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
