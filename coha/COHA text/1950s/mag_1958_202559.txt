The U.S. 's formal decision to go to the summit with the U.S.S.R.-a public U.N . Security Council session rather than a private smoke-filled room-came out of a week of tangled interchanges and conflicting pressures , which began with one of the crudest letters a President of the U.S. has ever received . Russia 's Dictator Nikita Khrushchev flatly accused President Eisenhower of delaying a summit parley because Eisenhower did not want " a peaceful settlement " in the Middle East , was in fact preparing " fresh acts of aggression ... to confront the world with an ever-increasing extension of the military conflict . " <P> Khrushchev 's real net : he was turning lukewarm about a chiefs-of-state meeting at the eleven-nation U.N . Security Council- " You know very well ... it has not decided anything so far " - instead preferred private talks . Khrushchev 's guest list : the U.S.S.R. , the U.S. , Britain , France , India , U.N . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold . Places to go : New York , Paris , Vienna , Geneva , Moscow . <P> " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear answer , " he wrote . " I would like the earliest reply to this message , Mr. President . " <P> Out of Disarray . The U.S. chose not to bat its reply back by return mail to Red Square , instead considered Khrushchev 's letter carefully , probed for weak spots . The problem : the letter plumped into a scene of disarray of Western allies , of disagreement about important details in official Washington . France 's De Gaulle was holding out for his private parley , all but refusing to come to the U.N . at all , and trying fruitlessly to rack up a new continental " third force " under French leadership ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . At home there was pressure from State Department elements and congressional Democrats for a " more positive " approach to the U.S.S.R. that usually involved concessions to placate neutralist opinion . The Pentagon , on the other hand , was restless lest the diplomats tie the U.S. 's hands-and the very real strength of the deployed U.S. Armed Forces-by agreeing to negotiate too much and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em by the tail . Do n't let ' em go . " But Secretary Dulles , at one of his ablest press conference performances , did his best to define some needed guidelines . <P> " I believe , " said he , " that a summit meeting held under proper U.N. auspices would , on the one hand , dispel the false allegations that there is aggression being carried on by the U.S. or by the United Kingdom in the Middle East . It would , on the other hand , I think , show the danger of indirect aggression , which has been so often condemned by the U.N . Thereby it might tend to stabilize the political situation which in turn would make it easier to develop economic programs for the benefit of the people . . . There is no use getting into the details of economic projects if the Middle East governments are going to live under a constant threat of indirect aggression , assassination and the like . " Though he was pressed from half a dozen different directions , Dulles notably refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggression in the Middle East .
