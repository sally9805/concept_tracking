txt A British scientist reported Wednesday that the safety and effectiveness of Sabin live virus polio vaccine were dramatically established during a polio epidemic in Singapore a few months ago . The report . by Dr. J. H. Hale of the University of Malaya , was presented to an international conference on live virus polio vaccine , s p o n sored by the world health organization . Soviet scientists had previously given the conference an enthusiastic account ' of their own ' successes in administering Sabin vaccine to 2,250,000 children . ? Only Licensed Vaccine The Sabin vaccine was developed by Dr. Albert Sabin of the University .. of Cincinnati medical school . The vaccine contains live polio germs which have been weakened so that they confer immunity to the disease without causing paralysis . The Salk polio vaccine , developed by Dr , Jonas Salk of the University of Pittsburgh and extensively used in the United States since 1954 , contains chemically-killed polio germs . The Salk vaccine is the only polio vaccine now licensed for use in this country . " Ideal Situation " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early months of this year , provided an " ideal situation " in which to test this " theoretical danger , " Dr. Hale told the conference . The epidemic was caused by type 1 polio virus , but the vaccine used was made of type 2 live polio viius . There were no cases of naturally occupying type 2 polio in Singapore at the time , and the researchers figured that if a lot of type 2 began to show up , the vaccine could be blamed for it . A total of 198,965 children were vaccinated . None of them contracted type 2 polio and only six of them devel. oped type 1 polio .
