txt Rep. Hebert ( D. , La. ) charged the Defense Department " coerced " the Air Force into switching engine overhaul work from General Electric Co. to CurtissWright Corp . and as a result , the Government is paving $25 million for a $3 million Job . The Louisiana Democrat , chairman of a House Armed Services subcommittee , made the charges as the panel concluded the first session . of its long-promised investigation into airplane engine manufacturers ' profits on military contracts . A year ago , the subcommittee conducted a similar investigation of the airframe industry . The contract , for the repair of 500 .1-47 jet engines , was switched to Curtiss-Wright a year ago , at the same time the big engine maker came to the financial rescue of StudebakerPackard Corp. , the ailing automobile company . Mr. Hebert said that while the work nominally totaled only $3 million , the Government 's total cost was $25- million because it had to help provide facilities to do the work at a then-idle plant at Utica , Mich. , which the engine maker leased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Air Force Opposed . Hebert Says The Air Force opposed switching the work , Mr. Hebert contended . but was overruled " at the Cabinet level . " He refused to disclose the source of his information but said the details will be brought out in - later testimony from Air Force officers . Funds for the contract , he said , were handled directly by Mansfield D. Sprague , then the Defense Department 's general counsel and now an Assistant Defense Secretary , rather than by the Air Force . Earlier , Roy T. Hurley , board chairman and president of Curtiss-Wright and the lead-off witness , had conceded that in order to keep Studebaker-Packard alive it was necessary to take over some defense contracts because the auto maker did not have funds to complete them and to perform these contracts  --  plus others solicited from the Defense Department ? in idle plants which Curtiss-Wright rented from the automobile concern . Hurlery Describes Negotiations The engine overhaul contract , Mr. Hurley said , was awarded after he went to the Pentagon and agreed to take over the Utica plant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how much business they would be willing to put into the plants . " Actually , Mr. Hurley said , the engine work represented only a " few dollars " when measured against the $35 million his company has plowed into Studebaker-Packard , and it has netted only " small profits " for Curtiss-Wright . Nicholas Dykstra , the company 's vice president for finance , said under questioning that 80% of the funds needed to prepare the Utica plant for engine overhaul work were supplied by the Government and only 20% by CurtissWright . He did not mention the over-all cost of conversion . Later Mr. Hurley expressed confidence in Studebaker-Packard 's future as an automobile maker . " I am of the opinion that StudebakerPackard can succeed " he declared . " In June their sales ( of automobiles ) went up markedly . In fact , they are running ahead of the rest of the industry " in comparision with the previous month . Value to Defense Noted Devising a way to " bail out " StudebakerPackard " took six months out of my life , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that " the successful continuation of Studebaker-Packard in the industry . . . should receive Government appreciation and cooperation " because of the company 's value to the defehse establishment . Asked by Rep. Cunningham ( R .. Iowa ) whether he thought he had bailed out the auto concern or bailed out the U. S. Government , Mr. Hurley replied : " I think , sir , we bailed out both . " His insistence that the bailing-out was accomplished with a minimum expenditure by the Federal Government was at variance with the charges later made by Mr. Hebert . Mr. Hurley said his company has deliberately chosen not to merge with StudebakerPackard immediately because " we want to prove that Studebaker-Packard can make money by itself . At present , he noted , his company has a " management contract " with the auto maker and an option , to buy enough of the latter 's shares to effect a merger . An immediate merger , Mr. Hurley said , would have laid open his company to charges of taking advantage of the company 's heavy losses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , he said , the auto maker 's losses might have been a drag on Curtiss-Wright . Curtiss ' Profits Discussed In his opening statement Mr. Hurley disclosed that in the first half of 1957 his company got about 65% of its after-tax profits from non-military sales even though about twothirds of his company 's business is with Uncle Sam . Military . sales in 1956 were $404 million out of total sales of $571 million . The aircraft executive said his company . is pushing commercial engine manufacture because it dislikes the " feast and famine " nature of military buying .. The company 's after-tax profit on engine sales to the armed services , he said , is only 3% % of sales . Unless profit margins are boosted , he warned , the industry will continue to be dependent on the armed forces for supplying many of its tools and will take a longer time to complete contracts . To overcome what he termed the " frustrations " of dealing with the Government , Mr. Hurley recommended that armed forces procurement regulations be simplified , that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government tries to recapture excessive profits ? be eliminated , and that the armed forces be given more freedom in spending their own funds . In addition , Mr. Hurley said , something should be done to encourage military contractors to provide their own equipment ? as Curtiss-Wright has tried to do . The Government should be willing to allow higher profit margins to finance the cost of this equipment , he said , rather than shaving profits too thin and insisting . on providing its own machines .
