My Three Years as a Dead Man By MAJ . GEN . WILLLIM F DEAN , USA , with wimum L.wi , rden The sick , tired , injured general faced relays of screaming , furious communists . Still Dean refused to " co-operate " with the heels . " All right , " said his chief tormentor filthily , " this is the end . We 're going to torture you . " Pt HT THREE ND now my biggest and most important A battle as a prisoner was to begin . It was the battle of ideas , with its sharp exchanges of question-and-answer fire . This battle began in Chonju with the original suggestion that I should broadcast on the communist radio , and never ended until the communists had given me up completely , either because I was too stubborn or too stupid for their uses . In all its facets , certain curious parallels were present , and possibly they 're valuable as clues to the official communist mind . One thing I noticed first was that these people were more anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any really useful information . Pressure was greatest to agree to obvious falsities : That the United States was an aggressor ; that we exploited South Korea ; that General MacArthur had ordered Syngman Rhee to start a war . But on our war plans , commitment of troops , infantry strategy or organization , they gave up in the face of bald lies or simple refusal to answer . I also noticed that questioners failed to evaluate known facts . They just went over and over the same lines , even when the answers could not possibly have made any difference . In September , 1950 , interrogators hammered at me day after day to learn prewar plans of the South Korean Army , which were thoroughly out of date , and lo make me admit things about the air campaign on which I , an infantry officer , obviously was no authority . There was also an almost pathological insistence on getting something signed . I would not go on the radio ; then I must sign a paper saying I would not go on the radio . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign a letter saying why I would not sign a letter . This could not have been for I he sake of the signature , to be transferred to vastly different documents , because they already had my signature in numerous places . Rather , I think it was a matter of a minor functionary 's feeling that he must take back something to show for an attempt to indoctrinate Dean , and apparently almost any old signature would do . Still another principle is the planned mixture of the real with the fanciful . Conversation may begin with topics so wild and absurd that even the interrogated person gets bored with them  --  and then suddenly lin &; hitnsoll on the defensive about 140111e-thing quite vital . ( Jr it unity appear in thrents or promises . The prisoner is threatened with cold or starvation , and suffers them both . Then he is warned that unless he co-operates something terrible will happen to his family in Berkeley , California . The pmmise of hotter fend brings it hit of meat into n dull and insufficient diet ? and right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a corps command in the communist armies . But the most important single characteristic of the Red mind is inflexibility . They never give up : they never change even the wildest and most absurd propaganda line , once they are committed to it . Possibly nobody below the top rank dares to change , and the top rank is too difficult for anyone else to influence . As I said , this verbal battle continued everywhere we stopped . A doctor tapped my chest again at Suwon , and we drove on to Seoul , crossing the Han River on the same hand-operated ferry which elements of the 7th Division  --  my old command  --  were to use a month Inter to reach the burning city . I was taken to the old **27;4360;TOOLONG building , where a major general told me to sleep on a table , which I did with the greatest of ease . In the morning I had a remarkable meal  --  steak , three eggs , French-fried potatoes . and eight ? count them  --  ten-inch loaves of bread , also a can of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ate everything but t he bread  --  of the eight . I was able to get down only a loaf and a half , secreting the other half in my clothes . Guards took away the remaining six . Very soon , a group of civilians , all with notebooks , came in , and questioning began . I judged these to be newspapermen , who were mostly interested in my experiences since capture . but also asked why I had permitted myself to he captured . I said quite a lot about the terrible truck ride between ( ' hinan and Chonju , but I could have saved my breath . The minute the story became unpleasant , the general forbade the press to write down any of it . Then one of the questioners  --  I think it was the general  --  said , " Would you like to see Ahn Chai Hong and Kim Kyu Sik ? " I said , " Not particularly . " Both these men were South Korean leaders whom I had liked , but I did n't care about seeing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and looked at me with the most shamed face I 've ever seen . I said , " How do you do . Mr. Ahn ? " but he made no audible reply . I think he was thoroughly terrified , because his palm was clammy when we shook hands . ( Both Kim and Ahn later went north . Kim died there , but the communists say Ahn is now some sort of commissar . ) That afternoon , another major general quastioned me , enviously trying to efenblitth that we had come to Korea before we were nuthorized to do HO by the United Nat ions . Then he asked the strength of the Nth DIV ittiCH 1 , KO I knocked Mon er tlellt off our act ual alrength , just to make I pWI 1 1 less cocky shout having pushed us back . 1 SSW , " We did n't expect war , en we clime understrengt h . I want you to re-MOD her that your People 's Army has n't done as well as you think , becamse you 've been fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was doing very well with this , but then he threw me a had curve . He said , " Did you personally explain to your men why they are fighting ? " That was a good point , because I had n't . I 'd done so in Europe and in . Japan , but this time I just had n't got around to it . Of course , I lied like a trooper to this communist general , but I also made a personal resolution never to neglect that detail again , no matter how tough the situation . That question really hurt me , and I hated like sin to have to lie to that buzzard and say , " Of course I did . " UT his next question was odd . He said . " How BU did you identify yourself up front ? How could people tell you were a general ? " I said , " I had two little stars on my helmet . " He said , " How did you identify your jeep ' ? " I said I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushions ? " and I said I could n't remember . That night I was ordered downstairs again , and this general went along . In front of I he building , he said , " Did you ever see this before ? " There was my own jeep that old White  --  Cpl . Malcolm D. White , my driver  --  had been so proud of , still with the leather cushions and the spick-and-span numbers on the front . This general presented me with my two-star license plate and handed me my own helmet with two stars in front and the taro-leaf insigne on the side , He said , " You can have these for souvenirs . " Then I was directed to a threequarter-ton truck , and he drove off in my jeep . A kitchen chair was placed in the middle of this truck and I sat on it . while my six-man guard sat on the floor . I have always thought of this driver as the singing driver , the Taejon-Seoul man as the hairy driver . But this fellow was also a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human . Specifically , he picked up a girl hitchhiker , giving her a favored seat on his left side , even t hough the English-speaking officer in charge was obviously against the whole idea .

That 's what I want to do if I 'm ever in that army , neat use drivers have it all over of ! teem . ) The guards evident ly were going on leave ; and on the whole trip , I hey sang . There was the Inman Gun song , a marching air ; another about Kim Sung Soo  --  one of South Korea 's lenders  --  which I judged In he either a hate song or possibly dirty , and one definite hate song , E-Syng-man , which President Rhee would not have enjoyed . There was also a little number extolling Stalin . We finally crossed the Imjin River through a ford and drove to Packehen , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At Paekchon we parked beside the police station while the escort officer went in  --  and I shall never forget that town . All the time we sat there someone was screaming inside the jail . This was someone being tortured , and whatever they were doing to him continued intermittently until we left , an hour later . My kitchen chair was coming apart , so we threw it away and I sat on the truck floor with the guards . I tried to stretch out , but soon the whole guard was on top of me . They meant nothing by it ; it was just their way with each other , but they were like a hunch of snakes . arms and lege everywhere , and all apparently on top of me . I had to stop the truck seven or eight times on account of my dysentery. and these stops gave me some rest . I also got a longer rest toward morning , when the driver , singing , gazed at the stars once too often . We ran off the road and overturned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men hurt his ribs and groaned the rest of the trip . The guard finally righted the truck , but then could not start the engine , so we walked seven or eight miles to a town which I was told was Oren  --  although I 've never found it on a map . There we went to a hotel ; but all day long , children wandered in to stare at me . Finally the officer took me down to the center of town so everybody could have a look . Nobody threw anything or even jeered . They just stared . That night , we drove on to Pyongyang , stopping beside a building which I was told was headquarters for the Political Security Forces . Presently another officer and guard took me to a house near Liberation Park . Here I was greeted by a pleasant Korean in civilian clothes , who said , " I 'll be your interpreter here . I 'm here to make you comfortable . " But he did not give me his name  --  Lee Kyu Hyun ? until later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house was western-style , two rooms with a double door between .

" He went on to prodlel I lila with Stalin 's death . Russia would blow up . More recently , Culler seem% to have modified this naive faith in " psychological warfare . " Last June he joined with William H. Jackson and others in a report to the President which conceded that " psychological warfare " must be part of a fully worked out total policy . Like most New England Republicans , Cutler instinctively opposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A warm admirer of Gen. George C. Marshall , he tends to dislike Sen. Joe McCarthy . Cutler 's influence on Eisenhower 's foreign policy has been felt less in the matter of content than in the energetic drive for decision which he has injected into the NSC 's workings . Everything discussed by the National Security Council comes before it in the form of " action papers " which are prepared by a Planning Board run by Cutler , and consisting of subcabinet officials from each agency represented on the NSC . Cutler has used the Planning Board to dig to the fundamentals that must be resolved , if anything enduring is to be accomplished . Where basic differences develop among the agencies , Cutler does not sweep the dirt of controversy under the carpet . He presents these differences clearly and sharply to the NSC for its choice between the alterna tives proposed . To keep up with Cutler 's breakfastto-bedtime working day , the Planning Board members have had to abandon virtually all leisure activities . Significantly , though , their morale is enthusiastically high . Cutler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions . More important , his integrity and earnestness in facing up to the facts brought before him have made the Planning Board members feel that their efforts really count ? which is all most Government officials need to be willing to work their heads off .

Lee also said he 'd been briefed about me , and had been told I was a tough , rugged individual , an uncouth type . He was amazed when I asked for something to read , and that I liked music . He could n't understand , he said , how anyone who believed in pure culture could be a soldier . He also managed to let me know he had attended school in Japan and had visited Moscow . On that first day he brought me a summer-weight civilian suit , with a Seoul tailor 's name in it , a necktie and a shirt with sleeves too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't tuck it into my belt . On the second day he arrived with a novel , Allitet Takes to the Hills ( about communism in North Korea ) , and a Soviet magazine , News , printed in English . This was full of stories of strikes in Japan , anti-atom-bombpledge articles and editorials lambast- Another Cutler innovation has been to tack onto each " action paper " an estimate of what the proposed action would cost . This reflects the new emphasis that economic solvency is as important as national security , which 124 probably the most important single decision yet made by the Eisenhower NSC . Although the revitalized NSC still is not the " General Stair for Peace " that Bernard M. Baruch and others feel it . should be , it has proved itself a workable mechanism for bringing foreign and domestic policy into balance : also for submitting the awful risks inherent in the struggle for peace to a more systematic and intensive calculation than any nonwar American Government has ever been capable of before . But the NSC has still to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be much stronger than the military power supporting it .

The consequent danger is that we may he incapable of much more than a policy of drift . Put another way . there are limits to what the most arduous and efficient staffwork can accomplish , unless accompanied by vision and a sense of timing . Cutler , himself , can not he expected to supply these qualities . Through his entire career , in his law work , charity drives , at the Old Colony Bank , he never has been responsible for basic judgments . Always others set the objectives with Cutler contributing his terrific energy and ability to organize and simplify the most bewildering details . In short  --  and this is undoubtedly how he , himself , would have it ? Cutler is not likely to become either the star or the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Cutler , however , the President has found a stage manager who can put whatever play is written into production for all that it is worth . ing the United States . I read both of those and others : Lessons in Leninism ; The History of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union ( three times ; ; the book Anti-Diihring ? anything they 'd let me read . I was trying to find out what all of them were talking about . I 'd studied Marxism as a political-science course at the University of California , but their interpretation of Leninism was all new to me . But I 'm an authority now . , Just for the record , one of the things communists were always yapping to me about was " McCarthyism . " All I could say was , " Who the hell 's McCarthy ' ? I never heard of him . " You see , all this happened after my capture . ) I also repeated to Lee my frequent request to be taken to a POW camp  --  and I remember his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your camps are very happy , very merry , very cheerful . They 're whistling and singing , and cracking jokes all t he time . " On September sixth I had a visitor , a four-star colonel  --  equivalent to brigadier  --  named Kim . I have every reason to remember this man . I know how he fumes when angry , his unctuous approach when he 's wheedling , that s.trruliDaV EVENING POST February ft* OM spittle fonins fnen leis motif ti when he 's threatening , but l Mel it hard to describe him . He 's just an ordinary Korean , but I 'm sure I 'll be able to reach out a heckoning linger if I see him again . And ' II he waiting for that day . Not that he was impletteant nt first . He was friendly , interested in my welfare , and left me ii folder of alleged statements by American prisoners to rend . Thew concerned at reeldui ion , said to have been passed at it mass ineeting of POW 's , ceiling for American troops to cease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them officers and men I knew , some who I thought had been killed . The resolution began : " We were brought here under the assumption that North Koreans had started the war , but we found out after we arrived that the war was in fact started by the South Koreans . who were the aggressors and have been for some time Colonel Kim 's request was simple : should add my signature : also broadcast to tell our people to stop fighting . The colonel spent a couple of hours with me , then said , " Now , I 'll give you time to look these over and to think them over . " The next day , we moved to a church in Sunate ? This building had been divided by a board partition at the chancel . Where the congregation normally sits , the twenty-five guards were billeted . The chancel area , about twelve by twenty feet , was for me : and here were the rug , chairs and cot from the Pyongyang house . Directly behind the chancel was another room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Next door was a small Korean-type house which was used as a cook shack , but there was no heat in the church . One guard always was in my room and the light burned constantly . A doctor had visited me at Pyongyang and had given my chest another good thumping , but my dysentery was growing worse and I was getting steadily more weak . I normally weigh about 210 pounds , but was down to about 110 when captured and had gained little , if any , since then . But when the polite Colonel Kim visited us again , he insisted we take a walk . I tried , but had to give up after a hundred yards . at a point from which we could look down into a valley . There , I got , a lecture on the virtues of communism  --  equality for women , no exploitation of one man by another , housing projects , state ownership of industries , redistribution of land . I should , he said , see the light and realize how wonderful all this was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiled beef , the first meat I 'd seen since we left Seoul . After lunch , Kim asked if I 'd signed the petition , but when I said I had not , I could see he thought he 'd wasted his boiled beef . But he did make one more effort : if I signed , he said , he could assure roe that I 'd spend the rest of the war at a nice home in the country , with plenty to eat , nobody to shoot at me and lots of sherry wine to drink . But about September tenth he came again , and this time he wanted my name on a couple of written statements which he said were things I 'd told him in conversation . One was to the effect t hat we were making a mistake fighting in Korea , battling not only North Korea but actually South Korea too . The other was even more simple : Syngman Rhee was no good , a rascal , a crook , a senile old man , a thief and only looked after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " represent my minimum requests . If you sign these , you wo n't be tortured , and you 'll go to a POW camp immediately . " Well , t hat mention of torture was not reassuring , but we did n't gel anywhere that day or in I he billowing two , when he kept on being persuasive , also talking about the 1 ) 011 ) 1161g of schools and villages . Bed was the greatest . thing in the world to inc then . My cares all seemed to drop away if I could get back to that bed and sleep endlessly . But about 11:30 one night Kim spoiled it . He stormed in and was n't in the least friendly . " Now , " he said , " I want you to sign this request to slop bombing our innocent villages . " I said , " Nobody will believe it if I sign anything like that . If I could get back to my own people , however , I certainly would advise them to concentrate on the People 's Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He kept insisting that I sign the statement . I was half asleep and sick , and I got what seemed like a brilliant idea at the time , but less so later . I said , " No , I wo n't sign a statement , but I will write a letter to General Walker , if you 'll get it delivered . I 'm sure you can do that , the way your people infiltrate . " I guess it was a silly thing , but I did it . I wrote along these lines : Dear General Walla , . Unfortunately I was captured on the 25th of August . It was a physical capture . I was overpowered on my attempt to get buck through the lines . el did want both the general and my son to know I had not surrendered.i I 've been well treated , but ' Fa anything but happy at being a prisoner of war . 1 urge that you impress upon the air the necessity to confine our air attacks to military targets . WILLIAM F. DEAN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools just might put it through , and if they did , I hoped General Walker would understand that I wanted better bombing , not less of it . But this letter did stop Kim 's harangue , and as I was going to bed , Lee said . " All Korean people will love you for this . " But so far as I can learn , they never did anything with it . Of course I have thought many times of these letters . I have no alibis for having written them , but I want to emphasize that I keenly regretted having done NO immediately after the deed was done . In fact , the following days were a nightmare because of my reviling myself for having so written . One of the most difficult problems for a prisoner is maintaining his judgment . A thought grows in your mind until you are sure it must he exceptionally clever . And sober reflection , which might show it up as being foolish rather than clever , just is n't possible under prison conditions . I wrote those letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great harm . Kim was just starting . He came back , and the mask of friendliness was gone . Paraphrased , what he said over and over was : " I 've got you now . You ca n't hack down . I 'm going to discredit you , you 've lost all dignity , so you might as well sign anything I put in front of you , I 've never lost on a man yet . I 've never failed to obtain my objective , and I 've had them tougher than you . " But I signed only one I hing more for him , and again I thought I was being cute . Kim had been after me about the hatred of South Koreans for Americans , wanting me to sign a prepared statement . that we should withdraw from the peninsula . I was feeling cagey , so I said I would n't sign that , but I 'd write a similar one . As I remember , I worded it : The United Slates has lost favor in the eyes of South Koreutu. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent saili. lary successes , and this has given them 11 national conecioutiness . Many South Koreans through fear have outwardly manifested hostility to Ameriesins , and if we drive nary to the thirty-eighth parallel , it will only be matter of lime until we have the same prob . tern again because seeds of Communism hove been planted in the South . I base this observation merely upon my experiences when I was harried fur thirty-five days in the mountains - - Again I attached my signature , and with it a secret hope that if it ever reached anyone who mattered , he would be able to see I was trying to urge our people to come north of the parallel , at the same time covering the thought with meaningless words to confuse the Reds . Colonel Kim carried that statement away like a treasure , but was hack a couple of days later , fuming mad . I guess he showed it to somebody who saw what . I was trying to do . Kim said I was a running dog of Wall Street and various other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me out of bed again and ordered me to Pyongyang . At a stop on the way , Lee pointed to some factories or dormitories and said , ? ' That 's where the American POW camp is . " Then we went across town to the Security Police headquarters again , and I was taken to an enormous room and introduced to a General Pak  --  who I think must actually have been Lt. Gen , Pang Ha Sae , head of the security forces . The general told me to sit down , said he understood I had refused to " co-operate , " but he was sure I would co-operate with him . He wanted , he said , to know three things : tit What . were American intentions in the Far East ? 12 ) What secret weapons did we possess ? 131 What was the plan of maneuver for United States forces in Korea ? There may have been a special reason for that last question just at that time . The tide of war was turning and at that moment , September fourteenth-fifteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him I had none of this information , but merely succeeded in bringing on a harangue , broken only when had to go to the latrine . This was one thing with which my interrogators never interfered . The gist of what the general had to say the rest of the night was that I was at their mercy , they were going to try me as a war criminal for things I did as military governor in 1948 , nobody would know what happened to me because American papers had already reported me dead , and they had " trained operators " who would make me talk . Finally he said he would give me time to think things over . I was taken to an anteroom and given a cup of tea , but I was very tired . I went to sleep , and Lee said I snored . When I was taken back to see the general after a Few minutes , and told him I had n't changed my mind , he was angry . He said , " You wo n't talk ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " you must sign a statement saying why you wo n't talk . " On a paper I wrote : Fortunately , I do not know the information you Hoek . Rut even if I did , f would not give it to you , because by doing so I would be a traitor to my country . So help me God , Wil.t.fAx F. DEAN . It seemed to get him off some sort of hook , because he let me go back to ' Sunnn , and for the next two days only a doctor  --  who actually seemed to know something  --  came to see me . He left medicine and put me on a diet of chock  --  rice cooked soft and gummy , with ! obi of water . But then the delightful Colonel Kim came hack . He wondered if I would n't " co-operate , " and again I signed a note that I had not changed my mind . Colonels Choe and Hong and a Major Kim ? worked in shifts , and a second interpreter . Tal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table , the interrogator across from me and an interpreter at one side . A guard remained standing , but when Colonel Kim came in to see how they were doing , he 'd loll in an easy chair . The room was icy  --  my guess is thirty to thirty-five degrees Fahrenheit ? and all the Koreans wore heavy overcoats . I started out in my summer suit , sock-footed . My left foot , infected by a chafing hoot in the hills , was the size of a balloon . The chair was especially uncomfortable and I had no padding left on my hip bones . Choe began the session about nine o'clock , using a prepared list of questions about military matters , and the interrogation lasted four hours . Choe wanted to know who had been assistant division commander and artillery commander when I had the 7th Division in 1948 . I asked him if he had n't read the newspapers . He also wanted the names of the ROK chief of staff , ROK division commanders and locations of ROK divisions when I was fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to the second tack . He told me how aggressive ROK commanders were , how most of them had Japanese Army backgrounds , and proceeded to give me a complete dossier on each one . Why he wanted names from me is hard to understand . For hours he asked about things which could n't possibly matter , which I could n't possibly know or which they knew themselves . It was tiresome , but not productive . Then he changed tacks again . What secret weapons did we have ? Were we going to use the atom bomb  --  they obviously were scared to death that we might ? and how did our airplanes find their way to a target ? What planes did we have in the Far East , how many airfields in Japan ? I almost wore out my vocal cords forming the words , " I do n't know . " We stopped a few minutes for lunch , then Hong took over .

I was special , he amid , and ti war criminal . 1 was gelling used to this title . Both Colonel Kim and General Pak had said I was responsible for the deal hs of " many patriots .

Even if we ever planned to do anything so silly , we certainly would n't do it when our top Korea experts were out of the country , we had no ships available and our troops were scattered all over Japan . " In the evening , Major Kim took over with searching questions about South Korean economics : Why we had not built more industries ? Why we brought in food rather than the instruments for food production ? Why we had n't constructed fertilizer plants , but exploited the country ? I said once , - That 's just your opinion , " and he immediately became wildly angry . " You 're not co-operating ! " he said , " You 're toadying to rank . You 're very nice when a colonel talks to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then he spent hours telling me about unemployment in the United States and the defects of our capitalism . Finally I said , - Have you ever been to the United States ' ? " He said he had not . I said , " And you 're trying to tell me about things that I was horn and raised with . I know more about the political structure than you do and more about conditions than you do . You 're plating . When you grow up , maybe you 'll learn something , but I 'm old enough to he your father . Talk about being ignorant , you 're the ignorant one . " He jumped up . " I 'll have you know , " he mid , " that I have my doctor 's degree , and I got it writing on the political and economic situation of the United States .

But obviously , he thought I was the most stupid general he 'd ever seen . I said , " Well , you 're lucky . So far as division commanders were concerned , you were lighting the second team when the war started . But we 'll have the first string in presently  --  maybe we do now , for all I know  --  and then WO he a different story . You have to remember that . all American generals are not so dumb as 1 arn . You just happened to catch the dumbest . " In the middle of the night I got the special ministrations of Colonel Kim , who spent an hour telling me I still was n't " co-operating . " While he talked my teeth chattered , and I his annoyed him . He said , " What are you shivering for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold ? " I said , " Yea , I 'm a little chilly .

" I ended up in my shorts . Then Choe came back . After Colonel Kim left , Choe also was annoyed by my teeth chattering , because he said , " You may puL on your undershirt . " I could see the pattern clearly : Choe was to he the kind person , my only real friend , while Colonel Kim ? who had already committed himself ? would play the part of the meanie . It 's an old police technique , which has whipsawed many a criminal into a confession . But the undershirt did feel wonderful . I got to keep it on until Kim came back . There were breaks for meals , but the Choe-Hong-Kim , Choe-Hong-Kim succession never stopped for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after using the last hour to give me information : I was a thief , a robber and a dog . " Arid I , " he said , " am going to treat you like a dog . " He ordered the guard to take away my cot and medicine . " No more washing , " he said . " You dog , you ca n't wash . You can have one blanket and sleep over there in a corner on the floor . We 're going to let you have some rest , but you 'd better think it over and realize you must co-operate . " During the sixty-eight hours I had been allowed no sleep . If I dozed , the guard would kick me with his bare feet . So I lay on the floor gratefully . I slept all day and that night , but the next morning , here came the boys again . Hong was lead-off marl this lime , and Exhibit A was an alleged captured South Korean report on a 1949 guerrilla campaign ? 40,000 houses hurried , guerrillas killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one guerrilla 's head , impaled on a pole . What , he wondered , was my conclusion about that ' ? I did n't have any . I 'd been in Japan that year . Then we shifted again to Cheju-do rind photographs of me , taken there ; then to some border town and photos of police lining up voters in the 1948 election . Then they succeeded in making me angry again . That had been the lirst free , secret - ballot election in Korea in 4000 years , and I was proud of it . But arguing did no good ; another questioner just came in . Finally I said , " You 're just wasting your time trying to get me to admit things which happened when I was military governor . It 's your language ; you have all the names , the figures , the evidence . I never sanctioned the killing of any soldier or civilian without trial , but . if any were killed without trial , in the final analysis , it was my responsibility . Anything which occurred ? NrFelpro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm responsible for . Why do n't you just shoot me ? Do n't wait and go through the farce of a trial . " This was n't exactly bravery , because I was quite sure they were going to shoot me anyhow . In the later sessions , the questioning did n't go on steadily . There would he hours when the interrogators were out 01 the room , but I still had to sit as if being questioned . and could n't even doze . Colonel Kim also came back . He said , " You say you have no knowledge of America 's intentions in the Far East , no knowledge of the plan of maneuver , of secret weapons . But you do have knowledge of the defense plans for Japan . You could not possibly have held the positions you 've had in your Army in Japan if you did n't know the defense plans . " So he worked on that for a couple of hours , yelling , storming and repeating the same questions . I was just sitting there , and once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " That was a good one . I wished I could be doing exactly that . He also said that if I did n't start cooperating soon , they 'd take measures to see that I did . But the interrogators got tired after a while and let me go back to sleep on the floor about four A.M. I was keeping track , just for my own satisfaction . It bad taken only forty-four hours this time to wear out the four of them . I 'd stayed awake four days in a battle in Europe , and these people had n't approached that total . But I did n't get my night 's rest . About nine P.M. I was awakened . Nobody said we were going to dance again . but I got the idea . Major Kim came to hat , then Hong , then Choe , but they I were showing signs of running out of questions and would leave me alone for hours . Whenever they 'd think up another question , they 'd come back and work on me for a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and most of that night ? thirty-t wo hours . About the second midnight , Colonel Kim took over once more , in what was to be the final session . Kim was in a standing-up , table-pounding mood , getting so worked up that phlegm would fly from his mouth . He was talking about the murder of innocents by our aircraft , when I finally said , " I 've seen atrocities committed by your troops worse than anything you 've mentioned . I 've seen our men who had been captured , then murdered in cold blood while they had their hands tied behind them , at Chochiwon . And talked to a lieutenant who saw your men drive prisoners ahead of them ; then shoot them when our other troops did not surrender . " This infuriated Colonel Kim so much that he yelled , " Close your eyes ! I 'm going to spit m your face ! " Of course , I should have said , " Spit . you creep , and I 'll knock you on your ? " But I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Close my eyes ! Go on and spit . You 've been spitting in my eyes for the last half hour . " I do n't know how the interpreter told him that , but it must have been accurate . I thought he was going to have apoplexy , He said , " All right , this is the end . We 're going to torture you .
