Darwinian Man , though well-behaved .. By REESE WOLFE Drawings by Gil Walker A T Tandjoengpriok , the port of entry to Batavia , as the capital of Java was then called , there were two things I planned to do . I wanted to see if it were true that the black monkeys lived on one side of the railroad tracks , and the white monkeys on the other , with none of either tribe crossing into the other 's territory . The other thing was to collect what pay I had coming for three months of labor and solitude as a cadet on the Grace Dollar . The Grace was a tramp freighter of the Dollar Line , out of San Francisco , and my pay on her was twenty-five cents a month . It was all I was worth , but since the Chinese crew lived in the fo'c'sle , and the officers amidships , the old man had decreed that the proper place for a cadet  --  who was neither fish nor fowl  --  was in the after deckhouse , which had served as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first world war . There , alone and ignored in my off-watch hours , I had the feeling of living in an isolation ward . Never had I been so lonely . Java was the midway point on the voyage , and the others had drawn their pay based on half of what they had coming . At seventeen that kind of excitement can be catching . It was n't the principle of the thing , it was the money I wanted . It would be my first pay on any ship and I intended to have it and spend it as I pleased , here on this hard-won foreign shore . I found the old man in his cabin dressing to go ashore . As I hesitated at the open doorway I was reminded again of how little he resembled my idea of what a sea captain should look like . He was twenty-nine , and seemed older even than that to me , in spite of his round pink face and baby-blue eyes that rarely showed any expression . I removed my cap and cleared my throat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My pay , sir . " " Your what ? " have half of three months coming , sir . " He looked at me with that blank unhurried gaze of his . " I see . " He motioned for inc to come in . At his desk he took out the pay book and cash box . " Three months , " he said , making some calculations with a pencil , " ? minus four days . Half of that comes close to thirty-six-and-ahalf cents . Call it thirty-six . " He handed it over without another word . I put the money in a separate pocket to keep as a special fund , and with a feeling of deep satisfaction , went over the side into a sampan to be rowed ashore . From Tandjoengpriok to Batavia was a five-61 mile run by rail , and as the rickety little toy train clattered through the mangrove swamps and into the rain forest I watched alertly from both sides of the car while the deepening jungle rolled slowly past the open windows . A corpulent Dutchman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband reached over and tapped my arm . " You look for de monkeys , ja ? " I nodded eagerly . He pointed upward out the window . I peered into the green depths impregnable to the sun and searched the tangle of vines and flowers that reached to the tree tops . Then suddenly I saw them , whole families of them , congregated high in the branches amidst the foliage that crowned the trees with flaming blossoms . " You see ? " he exclaimed , " Plack on dis side ? " " Und on dis side , " called his wife from the opposite window , " vite ! " " Und ( Icy do n't cross de track , " he assured me , " nefferl " " Nefferl " she echoed . Overjoyed with this confirmation of a half-believed truth 1 flung myself from one window to the other , back and forth across the car , while the Dutchman and his wife laughed as if they were personally responsible for the miracle . " Do you know vy dey do n't cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his eyes . " Ja , " said his wife , " ? dey bite off de tail ! " Her husband bit his thumb , demonstrating , and they both laughed uproariously . The monkeys on one side were certainly black , and those on the opposite side could be called white , although I could sec as the latter swung from limb to limb , that they were really blond . My Dutch friends called the blonds won-woo monkeys because , they explained , that was the sound they made at night when they were lonely . " How can they be lonely when there are so many of them ? " I asked . " Anybody can be lonely , " his wife said , giving me a searching look , " ? even monkeys . " From that moment I knew what I would do with my sailor 's pay . At Batavia I tramped the sweltering streets , unappreciative of the smiling brown girls in the markets with their betel-stained lips and batik sarongs , or of the ancient Dutch-style houses in the Lower City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sides . There were monkeys to be had , some of them blond , but no Malay or Chinese vendor would agree to my price . My failure sharpened my purpose . It was a point of pride that I wouldnot pay a penny more than I had earned on the Grace Dollar . Somewhere , I knew , I would find a woo-woo monkey to be my shipmate and a possession worthy of my pay . I FOUND him next morning , on sailing day , right on the dock . He was in a wicker cage borne on the back of a small boy in a ragged sarong who was smoking a corn-leaf cigarette . Huddled in a corner of the cage , away from the other monkeys , his plaintive " woo-woo " was unmistakable . It sounded like the cries of a sick baby . His owner was eager to sell , but not eager enough to accept my thirty-six cents . He removed the monkey from his cage and smoothed his fluffy blond fur , holding him up to me temptingly . He was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had a nose that gave him an intelligent look , for instead of being flat like the others , with the nostrils sideways , his nose was narrow with downward-pointing nostrils , and his eyes were large and lively . For an agonizing moment I considered adding to my special fund to meet his owner 's price . It was the monkey himself who closed the deal . His eye/ids drooped and he began to cry again , and the boy , thinking perhaps that I was afraid the monkey was sick , hustled me off to a Chinese money-changer with his tray of coins set up on the street . The money-changer refused the odd-cent of my thirty-six , ' but for the silver quarter and dime he offered me eighteen stuivers that looked like nickels . They made an impressive handful which the monkey 's owner was glad to accept . As my new shipmate clung to me with his unblinking eyes fixed on mine , I did n't look upon him as an extravagance . He was my sole reward For three months of labor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before he saved my life . We lived together in my crackerbox on the poop . I built a cage for him , but the bars suggested a jail , and I was ashamed to see hint gazing out at me reproachfully from behind them . So we abandoned it . When weather permitted he had the run of the poop on a light line to keep him from Fa/ling overboard while I was on duty below . Otherwise he was free of his tether to roam our private patch of deck as he pleased . I fed him rice and bananas , small red bananas the size of thy thumb , and his favorite dining place was on the metal framework once used to spread an awning over the deck in the ship 's more opulent days . The awning framework was his jungle gym . There he would swing from brace to brace for hours on end , pausing 62 DARWINIAN MAN occasionally to peer out across the shimmering sea , wondering , no doubt , where the trees were and all the other monkeys . He soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanchion he kept a lookout for me at the change of watch . While we toiled across the equator off the burning coast of Sumatra , he learned the meaning of eight bells . When I dragged myself wringing wet front the superheated depths below , he would slide down the stanchion from his lookout , brush away imaginary sweat from his brow as he had seen me do , and scampering ahead into the cabin he would fling himself onto my bunk and Iie there with his eyes shut , arms and legs sprawled ludicrously , as if he , too , were exhausted . He ate when I did , slept when I did , sat at the stern and watched the sea when I did . When I shaved he went through the motions . He had his own mirror , a " premium " I had saved from a long-gone box of Cracker Jack , and grimacing at his reflection , he ran a finger over his cheek while / sang to him , Darwinian man , though well-behaved , At best is only a monkey shaved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , and from the toe of a sock I cut him a pair of pants , not only for reasons of modesty , but for his vanity , since I knew he envied mine . We talked to each other , of course . He , like me , did n't know where he was going or when we would get there , and I talked to him of home while he listened and watched with sad , knowing eyes . He scolded me when I was late in returning to the poop from the messroom amidships . On the clays when he had to take a bath he dared me to come and get him from his awning perch . He admired the moon on the water , ridiculed the sea birds , protested the invasion of our deck by an occasional flying fish , and once , when I dropped and broke his rice bowl he shrieked , his eyes wide , mouth open , horrified by the scandal of it , and chattered about it all clay until I got him another . At night when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , and stroked him to sleep . It never occurred to me to give him a name . In the flowered treetops of his jungle world on one side of the railroad tracks to Batavia he mayhave had a name among his fellows . If he did I had no way of knowing it , any more than he could know mine . On our poop deck retreat it was enough that we loved and needed each other , and together were committed to the sea . The Grace Dollar was seven months out of San Francisco when we crossed the China Sea bound for Canton . By that time I had taken stock of my life and decided to abandon a career at sea , and go to college . There was still time to get there for the winter term if I could find a homeward-bound ship . The old man was n't surprised when I explained it to him . All he asked was where was I going to gel a ship . " Are we going to Hong Kong ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a moment . " If you get a ship out of Canton you 'll be lucky . " " Well , then , " I began desperately , " where ? " " Figure it out for yourself , " he said , turning back to his desk . E WERE steaming into the Pearl River above Hong Kong when we learned for the first time  --  or at least I did  --  that farther up , at Canton , they were having a civil war , a flood , a famine , and a boycott against foreigners , None of these would have stopped the old man from trying to pick up another dollar 's worth of cargo there . It took a gunboat to do that . They did n't shoot , they simply ranged alongside while we were still under way , and ordered us to anchor off Whampoa and wait . It was a makeshift gunboat , an outsize launch actually , with sandbags piled around her decks to form loopholes through which were thrust the muzzles of machine guns and the rifles of a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The gunboat waited , too , just to make sure . We waited a week before word came that the river pilot who was to take us up to Canton had been shot . To me it seemed as if now that I had set my mind on a definite purpose in life everything was working against me . Another week dragged by . Then one late afternoon the gunboat came alongside and word quickly spread that it was going up to Canton to investigate the trouble . While I stood gloomily looking down on her deck from the poop it came over me that here was my chance . I had nine dollars . It 1 did n't find a homeward-bound ship at Canton before my money ran out , Hong Kong was only a few hours down the river . It was supper time and nobody was around . The gunboat captain was aboard us with the old man in his cabin . All 1 would have to do was step across from our deckload of timber to the other 's deck . The old man himself had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask him any more questions . In my cabin I decided to abandon everything I could n't carry with one hand . I might have to stow away to get home , and the less I had to carry the better . Shouldering my sea bag , and with my monkey wedged into the pocket of my jacket , I climbed over the logs and stepped across to the gunboat . The soldiers drowsing behind their sandbags paid no attention to me . I picked my way around the narrow , crowded deck to the opposite side out of view from the Grace 's decks above , and stood there , breathing hard . I had n't been any too quick about it . Soon I heard the captain coming aboard . A jangle from below set the engines in motion , and we cast off . As the water widened between us I looked back at the ship with her tall black stack and its metal emblem of the dollar sign painted white . tower-ing above us . I was glad to be clear of her . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he spoke almost no English . He was a plump Cantonese with short-cropped graying hair and a round expressionless face every bit as blank as the old man 's . To discourage questions , I spoke rapidly . He gave no sign that he understood  --  or that he did n't  --  and with a thoughtful look at my monkey struggling to extricate himself from my pocket , he left me . I noticed that instead of going forward to the sandbagged wheelhouse , he went below , which seemed like an unduly cautious retreat for the captain of a gunboat . The swollen river was yellow with mud and littered with debris , and a hot cross-wind blowing down out of the hills fanned the water into soiled whitecaps . As we rolled on a zigzag course to avoid floating obstacles I saw that some of them were human bodies . They were bloated drum-tight and bobbed lightly on the waves . The lounging soldiers ignored them , but as the river narrowed and the number of bodies increased , some of the soldiers took up long poles with sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were a game . One thrust was usually enough . There was a sickening pop , a gurgle of escaping gas as it went under , leav-ing behind a stench T would not forget for a long time . I understood then why the captain had his quarters below . M Y MONKEY began to complain . Good sailor though he was , the motion of the boat and the stench that swept over us in periodic waves was making him seasick . I tried to shield him under my jacket but he struggled to get back into the open . In desperation I decided to take him below . Unwilling to risk being denied permission , I ducked down the companion ladder where I had seen the captain go , and found myself in his living quarters . Cramped for space as they were , there was a rich oriental rug , some ornamentally carved furniture , and a general appearance of opulence . Seated on a cushion at a tea table only a few inches high was the captain , drinking tea . His only show of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . 1 pointed up to the deck and held my nose . He nodded , replaced the cup , and waited . " My monkey very sick , " I said , holding him up so he could see for himself , " ? very , very sick . " He motioned for me to sit down at the tea table . There was a shelf on a bulkhead beside the table , and placing my monkey on that , I squatted on a cushion opposite the captain . It was good to breathe clean air again , but my monkey was too sick to care . He rocked back and forth on his heels , eyes closed , paws crossed over his belly , and cried like a baby . The captain hardly took his eyes from him . He clapped his hands , summoning a boy , and had him bring a cup for me and a bowl of rice for my monkey . It was no use . He continued crying in spite of the captain 's efforts to coax him to eat the rice . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I had thought so blank , showed increasing concern . He tried tempting him with other food . Finally , on the chance there might be such a thing aboard , I suggested a banana . To the captain 's obvious relief , to say nothing of my own , he accepted some of the fruit as it was fed to him bit by bit by the captain . When he could eat no more , and the crying had stopped , the captain , with an apologetic glance at me , took him in his arms and rocked him gently . Very soon he was asleep . It was still daylight when 1 followed the captain up on deck and watched our approach to Canton . The sprawling red-roofed city was partly enclosed by an ancient-looking brick wall that must have been twenty or thirty feet thick , and the waterfront was entirely concealed by 64 DARWINIAN MAN boats and rafts . The captain pointed out a low-lying island called the Shameen , separated from the city by a narrow channel , where the foreigners had taken refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , topped by sandbags . The place was isolated and desolate . I asked if he knew of any ships sailing east . " No ship leave Canton , " he said . He glanced at me curiously . " Where you go ? " - San Francisco . " " Ha ! Ha ! " He nodded good-by , and returned below . Until then I had been unwilling to acknowledge the thing beginning to twist deep down inside me . Now , as I stood at the gangway , sea bag in hand , I knew I must face it . If my monkey should get sick again , or cry , while I was trying to stow away on a ship , I might land in jail and never see him again . Or if I managed to sign on as a seaman , he almost certainly would not be allowed aboard . Meanwhile , here in this famine-stricken city , how was I going to keep him supplied with bananas ? . . There was only one thing to do . In all China he had one friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving myself a chance to fail him , I scrambled down to the captain 's quarters . " For you , " I said , holding my monkey out to him . He did n't understand . As I stood there , clutching my warm furry offering , I could feel the courage drain out of me . Blindly , 1 thrust him into the captain 's hands , and bolted up the ladder . On deck a sailor tried to stop me . He pointed shoreward , and by way of explanation , drew a finger across his throat . I shook him off and stumbled down the ladder . It was getting dark , and when I had made my way to the foot of the long jetty I stood looking up and down the crowded Blind , unsure which way to turn . I was still trying to decide when an officer from the gunboat came running up to me . The captain wanted to see me . I hesitated . Suppose the captain was unwilling to keep my monkey , after all ? There was nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tea table . To my relief the monkey was nowhere in sight . On the table were two strips of cloth on which the captain was inscribing with a brush a series of Chinese characters under a crudely drawn dollar sign . When he finished he pinned the hits of cloth around each of my sleeves and stood off , first to one side , then the other , inspecting his handiwork . If the arm bands were a gift in exchange for my monkey it was certainly an odd one , or so I thought then , but I was grateful for his delicacy in keeping him from my view . He made me understand that he would take me to a hotel owned by a friend of his . " What are these for ? " I asked , pointing to the arm bands . " He say , Dollah man , do n't shoot ' , " he said . " Cap'n Dollah good fiend China man . " A S WE made our way through the hostile crowds along the Bond I wondered how many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dollar man as highly as the captain did . His friend 's hotel was a small wooden waterfront building without lights . It was seemingly clused for the night . While he was trying to get an answer to his knock there was a patter of bare feet behind me , claw-like hands wrenched me around , knocking my sea bag from my shoulder , and a crowd of coolies swarmed over me , grappling , hauling , smashing at me with their fists . Their silent attack was more deadly than as if they had made a noise . In their voicelessness I sensed I was fighting for my life . Only the captain shouted . Others taking up his shouts came running , not as enemies , but to join in the free-for-all , and I found myself released as suddenly as I had been attacked . Over the hotel door a light went on . When it was discovered that one of us for whom they had driven off the attackers was an Occidental , there was some ominous grumbling . A few closed in threateningly . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not to the captain . One of my arm bands had come off in the scuffle , and snatching it up from the grnund where it had fallen , he shook it under their noses , loudly berating them , as they backed off . He left me safely inside the hotel with an unneeded warning not to remove my arm bands . That night while I lay on my bed watching the wavering light cast on the walls by a distant fire burning somewhere in the riot-ridden city , I tried not to think about my monkey . I made myself think , instead , of what the old man and the others on the Grace Dollar must he thinking by now , and of what I would do to find a ship tomorrow , and of home and the future . It was no help . Before I could steep in that eerily lighted room that would be my safe haven till morning , at least , the tight thing in my chest had to unwind . It was not an easy thing . Bereft of my sea-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sure knowledge that in exchange for saving my life I had kept faith with him in the only way I knew .
