ElO ' Letters to The Times Reducing Armaments Enforceable World Law Believed Essential to Achieve Agreement The writer of the following letter , a lawyer of international reputation , is the author of " A Plan for Peace . " He was one of the leaders of the Plattsburg movement for officer training in 1917 and helped write the Selective Service bin of 1940 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The turn of the year , a decade after World War II , is a good time to reassess our Position on disarmament and the achievement of genuine peace , as distinguished from a " balance of terror . " Looking back ten years the outstanding fact is that no tangible progress at all has been made on disarmament by international agreement . The nations maintain some eighteen million men in uniform ; the global cost continues at some $110 billions annually ; the weapons become ever more destructive . What is the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armaments by a single man , plane or bomb ? The basic trouble , I submit , lies in inadequate thinking and in half measures utterly insufficient to do what will alone suffice  --  namely , the establishment of enforceable world law . What is needed is a realization that genuine peace requires the same essentials as long experience has proved to be necessary for law and order in town , state and nation . International Law Enforcement As applied to world order this means : definite world law forbidding international violence , save only in clear self-defense ; an effective world police to deter and suppress violations and world judicial tribunals to interpret and apply the world law . Disarmament is also indispensable . But what needs to be understood is that disarmament can only be achieved , within a framework of world institutions providing method ! other than war , or the threat of it as the means of dealing with international disputes . It is no less than naive to expect I genuine peace on any other terms than the acceptance by the world community of those basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make possible the maintenance of peace in national and local communities . There is a similar inadequacy of thought , I believe , as to the dis ? armament process itself . It is not yet sufficiently understood that be . sides being universal and enforce . able disarmament needs also to be complete , right down to the level of strictly limited and lightly armed forces for internal order only . I/ we really want disarmament we must face up to the fact that national armaments must be abolished and not merely reduced . Bomb Power What are the practical prospects for complete disarmament within some such period as ten to fifteen years ? They are , I believe , excellent , and this for powerful reasons , Most important is the fast-growing power of the new weapons . As to bomb power , there is constant " progress " in obtaining more and more destruction from less and less bulk , and as to delivery , the development of ballistic missiles is likely to be a decisive factor . The " intermediate " missile with an accurate range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such missiles could be launched from many sites in the Soviet sphere it would matter little that the Soviet Union could be almost literally destroyed by Western bombs within a few weeks . For in the meantime all the chief centers of Europe and Britain could be obliterated within a matter of days or even hours . In this situation would not some , at least , of those nations press us to take complete disarmament more seriously ? There are , however , other important influences at work . There is the world-wide desire to lift the economic burden of armaments . There is the moral reluctance to engage in the mass destruction inherent in modern war and the growing realization that it is the arms race itself which makes major political settlements almost impossible . All in all , I believe that these combined influences will prevail and sooner than most people think . The result will mainly depend on the degree of self-help on the part of the peoples themselves . This problem is not one that can be solved by Chiefs of State , Prime Ministers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the executive officials can not reasonably be expected to initiate the new measures essential to genuine peace . They are too preoccupied with day-to-day problems and too inhibited by tradition to be capable of proposing the great steps forward in world organization that the atomic age requires . It follows that our sa:vation must in all likelihood Come from the creative thinking of private citizens not subject to the inhibitions of the executive official . Abraham Lincoln knew that a great new situation requires the people to take hold . He wrote in 1862 : " In a word , the people will save their Government if the Government itself will do its part only indifferently well . " Let the people themselves now press their Governments to consent to the minimum institutions -- world law , world police and world 4101111$11 ? which are the prerequisites ** disarmament and genuine pesos. 2* this way , and perhaps in this way . only , the peoples can save the world ' from disaster if the Governments will do their part " only indifferenttg well . " GRENVILLE CLAIM Dublin , N. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worker Endowments for Education trepan for Personnel Urged The writer of the following If* ter is Director of Dane/opined 0 the Family Service Association 0 America . To THE EDITOR or Tits Neat TOEE Your editorial of Jan. 4 " Phil's. thropy , 1955 , " pointed to the six billions contributed in philanthropist giving last year and rightly praised the foundations ; for their part in this . There is , however , something amiss in the picture , as Dean Johnson of the New York School of So . cial Work , Columbia University , pointed out in his annual report quoted in your news columns of Jan. 10 . He said , speaking of public generosity , " It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that an infinitesimal portion of this be appropriated for the cost of an adequate education and training program . " Seeing the coast-to-coast picture as we do at the Family Service Association of America , we wish to urge that in 1956 a close look be taken at the problem . American bounty deserves great returns in terms of improved human relations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services benefit . ing from this generosity is stronger than its professional personnel , both in quality and quantity . Social work across the country is badly understaffed by trained men and women . Our nation 's fifty graduate schools of social work , including Dean Johnson 's , need greater funds for training , and organizations like our own should be offering hundreds of fellowships to college graduates equipped by person . ality and intellect to enter this help ? ing profession . Government , industry , hospitals , churches , schools , colleges and other American institutions are pressing for the help of social workers who are trained family counselors . The quality available is high but the supply is indeed meager . Our country has a three-pronged national leadership from health , education and welfare . It is time more attention was paid to the needs of the third member of this team . CLARE M. TOUSLEY . New York , Jan. 10 , 1956 . Trend of Events in Peru To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : As members of the Inter-American Association for Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your readers the recent hopeful trend of events in Peru . It is significant that President Man . uel Odria has announced that he will not be a candidate for re-election under any circumstances , thus hon ? oring the country 's Constitution . Ix addition , he has also declared . a widespread amnesty for political prisoners and has invited various exiles to return . We hope that thin trend will continue . An election for President and for both houses of Congress is ached ? uled for next June . To be honestly democratic this election should per . mit the free and legal functioning of all political parties . This includes freedom to campaign on behalf of nominees for the Chief Executive and members of Congress . This is especialy applicable to the major political organizations , the Aprista party , or Partido del Pueblo . Recent events also give some grounds for hope that the Odria Government will allow the reformation of the country 's democratic labor organization , the Confedera ? cion de Trabajadores del Peru . A number of exiled labor leaders have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. T. P. , which is affiliated with the continental and world-wide free labor groups , the 0 . R. I. T. and I. C. F. T. U. , would certainly augur well for the future of democracy in Peru . If President Odria continues his present democratic inclinations and presides over a fair and honest elec. tion in June he will do a great service not only for his country but for democracy throughout the hem ' . sphere .
