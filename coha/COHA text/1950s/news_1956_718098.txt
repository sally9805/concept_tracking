txt Evacuation drills preceding today 's start of " Operation Alert , 1956 ' ' have pointed up the weaknesses inherent in scheduled tests and hinted the vast problems that might be met in full-scale , unheralded evacution . Massachusetts and Maine today evaluated " Operation Beacon Hill " and " Operation Home Run , " limited evacuation tests in Boston and Portland that took place yesterday . The ' former involved some 40 cars speeding 200 state officials from the State House in Boston to Framingham State Teachers College , about 20 miles away . The evacuation took just under 40 minutes . The Portland lest was aimed at seeing how soon after an alert signal the downtown area could be cleared . Public anticipation of the test was credited  --  or blamed  --  for clearing the area in about 30 minutes instead of the expected 11/2 hours . Meanwhile defense workers swarmed into emergency control centers throughout New England today to begin a 36-hour test of their ability to cope ? at this stage solely " on paper " ? with large-scale disaster . 11 A.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 a.m. without the fanfare of sirens or disruption of routine , business . The public would be largely unaware of the nationwide test , except between 4:10 and 4:25 p.m. , when a Conelrad test silences all regular radio and television broadcasting . During the test of Conelrad , the nation 's emergency radio system , the only broadcasting will be done at 640 and 1240 kilocycles . FM and TV stations will be off the air during the 15-minute test of how well the civil defense broadcasts can be heard on the emergency radio channels . Yesterday 's token evacuation in Boston was carried out under the linost favorable conditions , with the public forewarned both as to the time and route and with hundreds of police concentrated along the route concerned only with shepherding the single convoy . Nevertheless , the convoy moved at an average speed of about 30 m.p.h. over the 20-mile route . Occasionally reaching speeds of 55 m.p.h. , the  --  cavalcade was slowed at several intersections to 15 m.p.h. because of several noncooperating motorists . ' Good Job ' Done Also , part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police cruiser that had worked its way into the convoy turned off , leading the following cars back toward Boston in " Pied Piper of Hamlin " fashion . Gen. John J. Maginnis , state civil defense director , said police along the route did " a pretty good job . " He said the exercise had tested not only how fast the nucleus of state government could be moved from a target area but also the ability of local police to cooperate in blocking off traffic . He said " more detailed exercises " are planned for the future , adding that he hopes the size and scope of the evacuation drills will increase . Governor Herter and other key members of state government did not transact any business during his 11/2 hour stay at the emergency headquarters . In future tests , General Maginnis said , the state agencies " may actually work out here . " Morale a Problem The Governor hinted strong disapproval of full-scale evacuation drills , stating that such tests would be " a hideous inconvenience to all of our people . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states to the federal government , perhaps to Army control . The ' possibility of radioactive fall-out crossing state lines , he said , makes " single state responsibility an impossible thing . " Governor Herter said , " One of . the most difficult things is to keep up morale of civil defense people while they are working on paper problems and often not getting support from a citizenry that is fatalistic about what can be done in event of an ' attack . " The " on paper " problem fac- ing New England today involves imaginary bombing of Springfield , Pittsfield , and Worcester , Mass. , and New Haven , Bridgeport , New Britain . Bristol , Waterbury , and Hartford , Conn . Unscathed northern New England will theoretically be called on to receive evacuees and send resources into the bombed areas . Rhode Island and most of southeastern Massachusetts will be assumed to have radioactive fall-out from the Worcester bomb and will be unable to offer help immediately .                 @ @ @ @
