For weeks all Italy had been watching the campaign for a regional legislature which has no direct bearing on the national government . But Premier Mario Scelba 's Christian Democrats had declared the Sicilian elections a test of their anti-Communist program , and the Communists had accepted the challenge . <P> Last week 2,322,616 Sicilians voted and the verdict was a resounding victory for the Christian Democrats . They increased their share of the total vote from 31.2% in 1951 to 38.6% . They increased their seats in Sicily 's parliament from 30 to 37 , giving their regional government , which in Sicily acts in coalition with the Monarchists , an absolute majority . For the Communists , who had been answering losses in northern Italy with the claim that they were gaining in the south , the setback was sharp . They not only failed to gain , but even dropped some 17,000 votes since the 1953 general election . The Communist-Socialist bloc , however , held its 30 seats because . Nenni 's -fellow-traveling Socialists picked up 55,000 votes . <P> But the Christian Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Rome . Rejoicing most was the faction headed by Party Secretary Amintore Fanfani , who had run the campaign , poured money and workers into Sicily to offset the Communists ' $10 million election drive , and conclusively demonstrated that he could influence voters and win elections . <P> By increasing Fanfani 's stature , the elections diminished the influence of Scelba himself . Fanfani had scored another point . Scelba has always insisted that the Christian Democrats ' coalition with the small center parties ( Liberals , Republicans and Social Democrats ) is the only possible government in the present Parliament , and that a stable government is essential even if its disagreements result in immobilismo ( doing nothing ) . Fanfani has argued that these splinter parties hobble any effective Christian-Democratic program . In the Sicilian elections , the small parties lost almost half their votes , giving weight to Fanfani 's thesis . <P> Scelba was also under attack from his party 's right wing , led by ex-Premier Pella . This week Scelba faces a vote of confidence , and the word was out that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new : it has gone on ever since he took office . As of last week , Mario Scelba 's days in office numbered 487.
