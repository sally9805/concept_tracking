When the University of Washington fired Football Coach John Cherberg ( TIME , Feb. 13 ) , it sailed into a storm of scandal involving under-the-counter payments of money to players by booster alumni . But Washington was apparently still more interested in victories than in its reputation , so it hired young ( 31 ) <P> Coach Darrell Royal away from Mississippi State at $17,000 a year . Then , in a poll of the faculty , the student Daily showed how wide is the gulf between the playing fields of Washington and its corridors of learning . <P> The Daily asked : 1 ) Is the new coach 's salary justified , and 2 ) should football be de-emphasized ? To the salary question 81% answered no ; to de-emphasis 79% said yes . Many professors had further comments . Samples : <P> " At least 3 Ph.D.s , with individual professional and academic experience superior to our new coach , could be hired for his salary . " <P> " It is fantastic what a cheap price is put on ' education ' at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years preparing for education in specified fields when a man with nothing but brawn and no brains can get $17,000 a year for chasing a bunch of ninnies around a field with a ball . Every time I think of it , I get so outraged I could spit . " <P> The facultymen had reason for outrage . Though one physician on the medical-dental school staff gets a top salary of $14,376 , the average pay for a full professor outside the professional schools is $8,469 . Coach Royal 's 27-year-old assistant , three years after his service as a quarterback at the University of California , gets about $7,500 . The salary of 47-year-old Pulitzer Prize Poet Theodore Roethke , professor of English : $9,018.
