At the Nrnberg trials in January 1946 , SS General and longtime Nazi Party Member Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski gave damaging testimony about his former bosses ' plans to exterminate 30 million Slavs . Listening in the defendants ' box , Hermann Gring was incensed . " Dirty dog ! Damned traitor ! " he shouted . Later , Prosecution Witness Bach-Zelewski left Nrnberg a free man ; on Oct. 15 , 1946 , Gring mysteriously thwarted the hangman by taking cyanide of potassium in his execution cell . <P> <P> Last week the 52-year-old general , a Prussian army veteran , marched into the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Department office in Nrnberg to make a paradoxical confession . It was he who had given the face-saving poison to the man whom he had accused . <P> In the Nrnberg prison , Bach-Zelewski explained , he had kept the three phials of cyanide which all SS commanders regularly carried , for use in case of capture . Because he was a witness , not a prisoner , guards had not searched him . When Gring , who occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general obliged . One day , as they met in the corridor , Bach-Zelewski slipped the phial to Gring under cover of a handshake . It was hidden inside a bar of G.I. laundry soap . <P> The transaction , according to Bach-Zelewski , was quite impersonal . " I had no relations with Gring and did not like him , " he said , " but he was the first to ask me for the poison . " Bach-Zelewski gave another phial to a fellow SS general , who later committed suicide . The third , still imbedded in the bar of soap , he handed to U.S. intelligence officers last week . <P> U.S. officials believed Bach-Zelewski 's story to be correct . They did not plan to prosecute him , however , since the only evidence against him was his own confession . <P> Far from prosecution , the talkative general expected some assistance in return for his information . Although earlier acquit ted by a Polish War Crimes tribunal , he had been given a ten-year sentence two weeks ago by a German denazification court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had solved the mystery of Gring 's suicide , the general hoped , somewhat naively , that the U.S. would intervene to lighten his sentence .
