txt Hope for a truce in the excessprofits tax fight faded almost to the vanishing point today and the Republican leaders prepared for a battle Monday in the House of Representatives . They held the door open for amicable settlement of the issue that now overshadows all differences over the merits of continuing the tax  --  the use of drastic and extraordinary parliamentary methods to force an extension bill to the floor . However , Representative Joseph W. Martin Jr . of Massachusetts , Speaker of the House , after what was understood to have been a final unsuccessful truce talk with Representative Daniel A. Reed , Republican of up-state New York , indicated that he and the other leaders were apparently resigned to the necessity of a public showdown . Mr. Reed remained determined to block a vote in the Ways and Means Committee , of which he is chairman , on President Eisenhower 's request for a. six-month renewal of the 82 per cent corporation impost , which will expire Tuesday . Reed Receives Support The leaders had hoped that he might be swayed by yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to by-pass Mr. Reed 's group , thereby making it in order for the House to consider an extension bill despite the failure of the Ways and Means Committee to act . The result , however , was to stiffen his opposition , if anything , and gain for him the support of other Ways and Means members of both parties in a fight against what they regarded as an invasion of the rights and prerogatives of // legislative committees and the destruction of orderly procedure . While the battle was certain to split the House Republican organization and leave scars that might be years healing , Speaker Martin and Representative Charles A. Halleek of Indiana , the Majority Flour Leader , were confident of victory on Monday . The consensus , even in the opposing camp , was that they were correct . The House , under the procedure that will be in effect , will vote first on amendment or adoption of the Rules Committee 's resolution , which calls for consideration of a bill by Representative Antoni N. Sadlak , Republican of Connecticut , to continue the excess-profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100 , - 000 a year . The present exemption is $25,000 . The main fight will be made against the resolution involving , as it does , the extremely uncommon use of Rules Committee powers to circumvent a standing committee . If the House should reject it , the bill , of course , would not come up for action . If the resolution should be amended , then adopted , the House would be able to consider other tax proposals as substitutes or amendments to the Sadlak bill . Otherwise , the Sadlak bill would be debated four hours and voted on , with opponents first having one opportunity to obtain a ballot on returning it to committee . No amendments would be permitted . Nation 's Interest Put First Mr. Martin said that he had 1 " every expectation " that the resolution would be adopted , adding : " It will be supported overwhelmingly by Republicans . I know a number of Democrats will vote for it , and I do n't know of very many Republicans who will vote against it . " Democrats voting against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " denying the House a vote and destroying the Eisenhower fiscal pxogram . ' The country 's voters , he maintained , are interested in , results and not arguments over the parliamentary methods of achiev- ' ing them . Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts , acting Minority Leader in the absence of Representative Sam Rayburn of Texas , voiced opposition to the resolution on the ground that it would " shatter " the rules of the House . He was not optimistic , however , over the prospect of defeating the proposal . An incomplete Democratic poll of party sentiment was running 3-to-1 against the procedure , but more than 2-tol for extension ofl the tax itself . A similarly incomplete Republican check indicated , 1 according to one leader , that the Administration would not lose more than twenty-five Republicans and would pick up 50 to 100 Democrats . The present division of the House is 220 Republicans , 211 Democrats and one Independent . There are three vacancies .                  @ @ @
