At 8:25 one night last week , tearful women keeping vigil outside the presidential residence in Buenos Aires saw what they were watching for : a dim light in a second-floor room snapped out . Inside the darkened chamber , President Juan Pern walked away from the bedside of his wife . To waiting cabinet ministers he said , heavily , " Evita is dead . " <P> Outside , a man with a crepe-draped Argentine flag perched himself in the fork of a tree and announced dramatically that he would stay there forever . ( Rain soon forced him down . ) Churches throughout Argentina tolled a slow , mournful death-knell . A month of crises in Eva Pern 's illness had put the nation on notice that she would die ; by sunrise the citizens had draped buildings and lamp posts in black . <P> Next day , a black van brought Evita 's silver-trimmed cedar casket to the triangular Ministry of Labor building , where her body was laid in state in the gold-domed room she used as an office during her rise to power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mauve and white orchids , Peronistas gathered outside until finally there were half a million of them ; four were killed , 2,500 injured in the crush . At length the ministry 's doors were opened , and the grieving mob poured in to peer through the casket 's full-length glass top at the wasted body of the 20th century 's most powerful woman . <P> Lady of the Descamisados . Only nine years ago , Eva Duarte was just a beguiling girl from a modest home in the pampas , trying to make her way in movie bit parts and radio soap operas . Her assets -a trim , 5-ft. - 5- in. figure , a coldly sexy manner and a shrewd if untutored brain - made her popular at parties . At one of them she met Colonel Juan Pern , then a comer in the Ministry of War . That very night they slipped off to a seaside resort ; soon they were occupying next-door apartments . <P> Evita 's only toehold on philosophy was a bitter conviction that " there are rich and there are poor , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me less than the knowledge that at the same time others are rich . " This idea dovetailed with Pern 's own belief that an ambitious man could get to the top by becoming lider of Argentina 's millions of poor , politically neglected " shirtless ones . " * Eva Duarte quickly showed a sure , histrionic instinct for winning the descamisados over to Pern ; when he was jailed by political enemies in 1945 , she successfully urged 50,000 howling workers from the slaughterhouse district into the streets and got his freedom in eight days . Four days later , a secret civil marriage sealed their conjugal-political union . After Pern was elected President , Juan and Eva began their spectacular man &; wife dictatorship .
