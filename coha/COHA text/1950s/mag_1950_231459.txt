At a lavish caviar &; champagne banquet , attended by all the top Soviet brass , Moscow last week honored visiting Finnish Premier Urho Kekkonen . The Premier had earned his fine meal . He had just signed a five-year trade treaty that is designed to shackle stubborn little Finland 's economy to Russia for good . Under the new treaty , nearly all of Finland 's foreign trade will be geared to Russia : machinery , ships , lumber products and prefabricated houses in return for Soviet grain , fertilizers , raw materials and oil . Finnish sales to Russia will increase each year , making Finland ever more dependent on Soviet markets . <P> After returning to Helsinki in a special Russian plane , Premier Kekkonen proudly termed the $350-million treaty the biggest deal ever made by Finland . It would in all likelihood also be the costliest.
