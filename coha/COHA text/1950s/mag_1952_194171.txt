Equipped with bedrolls and pup tents , 125 boys &; girls settled down last week at Rock Springs Ranch in Kansas for three days of talk . Their encampment was no ordinary one , nor was their talk idle . The 125 , all students from Kansas State College , were trying to decide how to improve their campus . <P> Such conferences have become annual affairs at Kansas State ; and from President James A. McCain on down , the entire faculty eagerly awaits their outcome . They began six years ago , when a group of veterans confronted McCain 's predecessor , Milton Eisenhower , with a list of " gripes . " Ike 's educator brother ( now president of Penn State ) was impressed , called in some of the faculty to hear the complaints . Since then , students have elected representatives and the conference has become a full-fledged policy-making body . <P> Last week 40 professors were on hand to hear themselves criticized or praised . They listened while the campers discussed 100 different topics - from the time coeds should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . Gradually , the topics boiled down to 30 recommendations . Samples : try an honor system for one year in classrooms ; paint campus trash cans white . The students voted down the idea of selling beer on campus . <P> This week President McCain will go over the recommendations , and students know that they will get careful attention . In the past the students have been responsible for such changes as turning the biweekly undergraduate newspaper into a daily , placing sidewalks around the campus . In seven years 80% of their recommendations have been adopted .
