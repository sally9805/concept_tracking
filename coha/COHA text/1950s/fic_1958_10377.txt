14  --  Ison of a bitch , " he said slowly . " The dirty rotten little son of a bitch . " George turned back to look . It was like watching a movie , except that the screen was on the ground instead of on a wall . At the far end of the alley Old Man Saydl was inching along , dragging his broken body slowly in the sawdust , heading for his hiding place . He thought he was all alone in the Forest . But he was n't . He was completely surrounded . The soldiers were coming at him in three groups , from three different directions . Some of them were still carrying beer bottles . All of them were hugging the walls of the alleys . They reminded George of Indians sneaking up on a wagon train in one of Miss Corcoran 's story books . Then George recognized the little guy with the muscles leading the middle column . " It 's Doodoo ! " he said . " The son of a bitch , " Danny said again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which they were lying . " Okay , " Danny said , and for a moment George did n't realize Danny was not talking to him . " Okay , you bastard , " Danny said softly . " You asked for it . " He started down the stack . " Where you going ? " George said . Danny did n't answer . George said , " Want me to come with you ? " " Stay up there , " Danny said . " Keep an eye on them . " His head disappeared below the edge of the stack . George turned back to the soldiers . He was surprised at how quietly they were moving . With all that beer inside them , George would have thought they 'd be yelling blue murder . He did n't know how long he 'd been watching , when all of a sudden he heard something at the other side of the Forest . George squirmed around on his belly and looked up toward Lewis Street . Something funny seemed to be happening in Gerrity 's back yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shkutzim were piling out of the saloon , running toward the fence that separated Gerrity 's from the Forest . George could see Danny in the lead and , behind him , the big , red-headed figure of Mike Gerrity . George saw them go over the fence and come down the long alley between the lumber stacks , yelling as they came . Just as Doodoo Kashkewitz and the soldiers turned to face them , George saw Danny 's father . Mr. Schorr was running with the shkutzim , waving a beer bottle and yelling . He stopped behind Danny and Mike 141 lGerrity . The shkutzim bunched up in a ball back of them . The soldiers did the same behind Doodoo Kashkewitz . Looking down on them from the top of the lumber stack , George was reminded of a couple of ant hills he 'd once kicked in Tompkins Square Park . There was a lot of crawling and squirming and pushing , but the two groups remained separated by a narrow open space . Danny stepped out of his group , into this open space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come faster . Danny did it as though he was General Pershing or somebody . " Okay , Doodoo , " Danny said . " Take your friends and get the hell out of here . " Doodoo wet his lips with his tongue . " Who 's gon na make us ? " " Me and my friends . " Danny jerked his thumb at the shkutzim behind him . Doodoo gave them a quick look . Then he glanced at the soldiers crowding up against him . George had the feeling Doodoo was counting , to see who had more men . From the top of the lumber stack , where George lay on his belly , it was n't necessary to count . There were almost twice as many shkutzim as soldiers . " Anybody 's getting the hell out of here , " a soldier yelled suddenly , " it ai n't gon na be us ! " " Come on ! " another soldier yelled . " Let 's get these bastards ! " They started forward . George , who was watching Doodoo , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doodoo seemed to be leaning back , as though he were a dam and the soldiers were a river and he was trying to keep the water from breaking through . For a moment or two George did n't understand what was funny about it . Then he saw Doodoo stagger , as though the dam was beginning to go , and he realized what made it look funny . A split second before he heard Doodoo 's voice , just from the look on his face , George knew Doodoo Kashkewitz was scared . " You rotten bastard ! " Doodoo screamed at Danny , the words choking in his throat . " You dirty stinking shkutz lover ! Why the hell do n't you fight with your own people ? " Mike Gerrity hitched up his pants . " Okay , boys ! " he said to the shkutzim across his shoulder . " Let 's shovel the garbage out of this lumber yard ! " He moved forward . Danny moved with him . So did Danny 's father . George saw it clearly because George was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drunken soldiers who came up142with the plank and shoved it into the side of the lumber stack behind the shkutzim . George did n't know anything about it until the stack began to rock and he heard Dora scream . Then he remembered that he 'd left her as a lookout at the other side of the Forest , on top of a lumber stack . Quickly George pushed himself back to the edge of his own stack and started down . But it was too late . A great many people were suddenly screaming . But it was only Dora 's voice George heard . " Help me , George ! " she screamed as the stack started to go . " George , help me ! " she screamed . " Help me ! " 7 " Go ahead ! " Uncle Zisha said . " Do n't be bashful ! Smell the air ! Breathe it in ! Up here in Albany it 's not like in New York ! Up here for fresh air there 's no charge ! " He sucked in a deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was n't easy . Uncle Zisha was moving across the railroad station like a greyhound in the newsreels . His long , loping strides pulled him forward so fast that George had to trot to keep up with him . " In New York , on that verkockte Fourth Street , " Uncle Zisha said , " it smells like this ? " George did n't know whether Uncle Zisha expected an answer . The big man in the long overcoat was steaming toward the street doors as though he were trying to win a race . " I asked a question ! " His voice reminded George of the barge horns on the river back home when the fog closed in from Brooklyn . " Air like this you ever smelled ? " George , who had just stepped out of the train from New York , made another stab at sampling the air . The only other railroad station he 'd ever been in was Grand Central . The air in this station smelled just about the same . " No , " George said . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelled air like this , " George said . The big man paused in his gallop toward the street . He turned1 143 1to look down at the boy beside him . The large , broad , handsome face broke in a sudden , unexpected smile . Uncle Zisha put out his hand . He touched George 's shoulder . It was like receiving without warning the weight of one of Mr. Forman 's butter tubs . George staggered . " You bet your life ! " Uncle Zisha said . " This is America you 're smelling ! " He kicked open the door to the street . He held it wide with George 's suitcase and gestured with his free hand . He looked like Balboa discovering the Pacific in the picture over Miss Corcoran'sdesk . " Go on ! " Uncle Zisha cried . " Take a look ! For the first time in your life you 're seeing a piece of America ! Take a good look ! " George took a good look . IIe saw a row of yellow taxis and a long black Buick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery store , an ice-cream parlor , and a shoe-shine stand . He had a feeling of disappointment . If the taxis and the Buick had been parked in front of Mr. Kashkewitz 's blacksmith shop on East Fourth Street , the scene would have been the same . Uncle Zisha 's letters , from which Aunt Tessie had been reading aloud for years , had led George to expect something more of Albany . " Here you 'll begin to understand why people come to this country from garbage pails like Austria ! Here you 'll begin to live ! Come on ! " Uncle Zisha grabbed George 's hand . He dragged him across the street . They stopped in front of the Buick . Uncle Zisha tossed George 's suitcase into the back . George blinked . " It 's yours ? " he said . He knew from what Aunt Tessie had told him that UncleZisha was rich . It had never occurred to him , however , that AuntTessie 's brother owned a car . Nobody on Fourth Street owned a car . Not even Mike Gerrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it was n't mine , would I put your satchel in it ? " Georgecould see that Uncle Zisha was getting a kick out of George 's surprise . The big man opened the door . " Jump in . There 's no charge . You 're now with Zisha Hurst . Everything is going to be all right . " George gave him a quick look . It had not occurred to him untilthis moment that Aunt Tessie must have told Uncle Zisha in oneof her letters all about what had happened in the Forest on ArmisticeDay . But George could n't read anything in the big man 's face . Uncle Zisha was walking around the front of the car . He 144opened the door on the far side and climbed in behind the wheel . George opened the other door and slipped in beside him . " You like this car ? " Uncle Zisha said . It started with a roar and a jerk , as though it had been kicked from the curb by a giant foot . George 's head snapped back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Zisha chuckled . " It 's the biggest model . They had it standing there in the window on Pearl Street . I was walking to the bank and I stopped to take a look , and the minute I saw it I said to myself this they made for Zisha Hurst , special ! So I went in and I bought it . You ever had a ride in a car like this before ? " " I 've never been in a car before , " George said . Uncle Zisha clapped his hand to his forehead as though he was trying to kill a fly . " What kind of a head have I got , a thing like this I should n't know ? Where on that verkockte Fourth Street would a person get rides in cars ? " He laughed . " So today it 's for you a whole bunch first things ! First time in Albany ! First time to meet Zisha Hurst ! And first time in a car ! " He laughed again . " Wait , wait ! There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ! Wait till you see the factory ! Wait till you see Mrs. Gerstenberger ! " He drove the way Art Acord rode his horse in The Oregon Trail , the weekly movie serial George and Danny Schorr and Dora Dienst had followed for almost a year at the American Theatre on Third Street . Uncle Zisha sent the car forward in a roaring burst of speed that carried them anywhere from ten feet to half a block . Then , as somebody stepped down from the curb or another car appeared up ahead , he slammed on the brakes . The car , like Art Acord 's horse when suddenly reined in , seemed to rear up on its hind legs and come to a shuddering halt . The pedestrian or other driver screamed and yelled . Uncle Zisha roared with laughter as he poked and kicked at the controls of the stalled car to get it started again . When he was n't laughing , he was pouring out in his loud , booming voice a running commentary in which the modest , neat little frame houses along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms so glowing that they would have been a trifle excessive if they had been applied to the Taj Mahal . George heard very little of it . A few minutes after they pulled away from the railroad station the palms of his hands had suddenly begun to sweat and the terrible , familiar sick feeling came bubbling 145 1up in his stomach . Without warning , the way it had been happeningover and over again for weeks , he found himself back in the Forest , remembering Dora on top of the lumber stack where he had left her , watching with horror as the stack began to go , seeing Mr. Schorr 's drunken face peering up at him from among the drunken soldiers who had followed Doodoo Kashkewitz into the Forest , and hearing Dora 's terrified screams for help . George knew he was swallowing hard and fast , because he had discovered this was the only way he could keep the sick feeling from bubbling over . But George did not know he had closed his eyes tight until somebody tapped him on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a moment , for a split second of agonized embarrassment , he thought he saw Uncle Zisha watching him with a troubled frown . Then the moment was gone . It was possible that it had never even existed . Because Uncle Zisha 's big , handsome face was once again broken up into the small , crinkly pieces of his shining smile as he gestured toward the house in front of which he had stopped the car . " This is where Zisha Hurst lives , " he said proudly . " A little bit different from two egg boxes in back of a store on Fourth Street , no ? " George had never seen a house like this , except in the movies and in newspaper and magazine pictures . Unlike the huge gray tenements made of brick on East Fourth Street , this house was made of wood . It was very white , so white that it hurt your eyes a little to look at it in the bright sunlight , and it had green shutters with small crescents cut into the tops and bottoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides . The houses were separated from one another by trees and gardens . Uncle Zisha 's house seemed more separated than any of the others because Uncle Zisha 's house sat on the very top of the hill . It was n't much bigger than some of the other houses , but it seemed to tower over them the way Uncle Zisha had towered over everybody in the railroad station . There was a driveway at one side that led to Uncle Zisha 's factory behind the house . The driveway was spanned by a curved wooden arch across which was printed in large black and gold letters : " Hurst Soda Bottling Works , Inc . " " We better go in , " Uncle Zisha said . " Mrs. Gerstenberger is looking out at us from behind the curtain . If we keep her waiting another minute , she could maybe bust , and when Mrs. Gersten- 146 lberger busts , believe me , it 'll make a splash you could hear all the way down in New York . " She was a short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball on which somebody had stuck a gray wig and painted small , inadequate features . It was impossible to tell whether nature , or her years as Uncle ' ' ' /isha 's housekeeper , had twisted those features into the troubled look that was as permanent a part of Mrs. Gersten- berger as her spotless blue and white checked apron . It was the look of a woman who , while trying hard to concentrate on what was happening in her immediate presence , could not help listening nervously for the sound of something about to fall in another part of the house . ' This is my nephew George , " Uncle Zisha said when she opened the door for them . " My sister Tessie said we should take good care of him . " Mrs. Gerstenberger beamed shyly at George and touched his head with one of her round , red , pudgy hands . She did it hesitantly , as though he were a piece of china that she wanted to make sure was in its proper place on a shelf but which she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll try , " she said in a thin , squeaky voice that seemed hope- lessly inadequate for supporting so heavy a German accent . " Ve 'll to our pest vid heem . " The process started almost at once , with the midday meal . It was served in a dining room as large as Aunt Tessie 's shop . On two of the walls hung large , beautifully framed pictures of a handsome , dignified man with white hair and eyes so sad that they brought a lump to George 's throat . Both pictures were identical . The door from the living room was propped open by a small yellow canvas sack about the size of a watermelon . It was lumpy and shapeless , as though filled with potatoes , and fastened at the top with a draw- string as thick as a clothesline . George and Uncle Zisha sat at opposite ends of a table that could have been brought into the room in which he slept on Fourth Street only by taking the table apart in the street , carrying it through the store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every inch of it , he soon saw , was neces- sary to accommodate Mrs. Gerstenberger 's notion of a decent meal . " Eat , eat ! " she squeaked in a pleading whisper as she stared worriedly at the bowl of soup he had been unable to touch and pushed the platter of rye bread closer to him . " Your uncle set if py 147 1the time you ko home to New Yuk you 're not ten pounts heftier , he 'll trow me out in the stritt ! " George forced himself to take a mouthful of soup and wondered why she was whispering . Then he glanced at Uncle Zisha , and George saw that eating was a serious business in this green and white house on Westerlo Street . The big man at the other end of the table ate in silence , leaning low over his plate , breathing heavily as he stoked himself with short , economical thrusts of his loaded fork or spoon . Uncle Zisha at table reminded George of shkutzim he had seen on the Fourth Street dock , shoveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons on days when the loading crane was out of order . Please , God , please do n't let me get sick right here at the table , George prayed deep down inside his head , behind the place from which he forced himself to watch Uncle Zisha work his way through two bowls of thick bean soup , a slab of roast veal with potato pancakes , red cabbage , and green peas , a platter of rye bread , a lump of rice pudding as big as a grapefruit , half an apple pie , and a plate of stewed prunes and apricots . Occasionally , when his mouth was too full to accommodate more , or while he waited for Mrs. Gerstenberger to refill his plate , Uncle Zisha would wink at George or make an encouraging gesture with his fork , urging George to dig in more heartily . Not a word was spoken , however , until Uncle Zisha had finished his third cup of black coffee . " Judge Brandeis , " he said , nodding toward the beautifully framed pictures on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham Lincoln . " He waited , as though he expected George to say something , but George could n't think what . A puzzled look appeared on Uncle Zisha 's face . " Judge Brandeis , " he said again , and he waited once more . The puzzled look changed to disbelief . " George , " Uncle Zisha said . " You never heard of Judge Brandeis ? " " No . " For a moment , the only moment since George had first set eyes on the big , handsome , friendly face , it reflected anger . " That verkockte Fourth Street ! " Uncle Zisha said bitterly . " That  --  that  --  ! " The bitterness and the anger went as quickly as they had come . " So all right , " Uncle Zisha said as he pushed himself back from 148 lthe table and then up out of his chair , doing it in two series of slow , deliberate movements executed with all the care and precision of a tug warping a liner into her mooring . " So all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally stood erect . " That 's another first thing for you here in Albany ! To know there is such a person like Judge Brandeis ! " With a slight wave of his hand , as though he were departing for a short journey on which he would not be gone long enough to justify a more elaborate or even spoken farewell , the big man moved heavily across the dining room , through the door propped open by the yellow canvas sack , and disappeared into the living room . George , after hesitating for a moment , stood up and started to follow . Mrs. Gerstenberger caught him at the door . " No , no ! " she squeaked in a terrified hiss . " It 's the lunch ! " Astonished , George stepped aside . Mrs. Gerstenberger hurried into the living room . From the doorway George watched Uncle Zisha lower his great big body , now distended by the huge meal , onto a brown leather couch with a headrest at one end . He undid his belt and the top button of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiring glance up at the picture of Judge Brandeis that hung over the couch . It was another copy of the two pictures in the dining room . Then Uncle Zisha closed his eyes . Mrs. Gerstenberger came up swiftly with a large red silk handkerchief , spread it over Uncle Zisha 's face , tiptoed to the window , drew down the shade , and then , with a finger to her lips , she came back to George in the doorway . " Effry tay , " she said as she led George away from the living room , " efter he eats , for one hour it 's the lunch . " Years later George realized why Uncle Zisha 's siesta was called the lunch . It was Mrs. Gerstenberger 's way of pronouncing the word by which she and Uncle Zisha identified the piece of brown leather furniture on which he took his midday rest : a lounge . On that first day in the house on Westerlo Street , however , asMrs . Gerstenberger took him upstairs to show him his room , Georgerealized only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bubbly feeling had started to churn once more in his stomach . " You petter take a lunch , too , " Mrs. Gerstenberger said whenthey came into the sunny little room on the second floor whereGeorge 's suitcase lay on a chair near the bed . " Your uncle , ven he149 lrakes op , he 's like a steam injin ! A person could year out chust from votching heem ! " George did n't answer . He could n't . " If she does n't get out , " he thought desperately , " I 'll puke right here , in front of her . " The thought of this humiliation made the bubbly feeling in his stomach get worse . " Please , God , no , " he prayed . " Please , God , do n't let me puke . Please , God , get her the hell out of here fast . " " Ve 'll unpack the tinks fum the setchel later , " Mrs. Gerstenbergersaid . " Fum New Yuk it 's a lunk trip . A little lunch you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't trust himself to speak . " Go ! " he screamed inside his head . " Go ! " And then , somewhat incredibly , she was gone . George stood there , staring at the closed door , listening to her tiptoeing heavily down the hall toward the stairs , trying not to relive again the horror of those moments when the lumber stack started to go and Dora began to scream  --  and then he stopped trying . It did n't do any good . It had n't done any good for weeks . He stepped quickly to the basin in the corner of the room and was sick . George remained there for a long time , resting his forehead against the cool white enamel of the basin , wondering stupidly how long it would be before he could forget . He guessed he never would . Aunt Tessie disagreed . Aunt Tessie thought all he needed was a change of scene . That was why she had gone to Miss Corcoran and asked if she could take George out of school for a couple of weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aunt Tessie had felt that all George needed to forget what had happened on Armistice Day was to get away from Fourth Street for a while . But George knew better . George knew what Aunt Tessie may have suspected but could n't really know . George knew about the nightmares , and the times during the day when the nightmares closed in on him in broad daylight . George could see the twisted , broken body of Danny 's father , and he could hear Dora whimpering , and he could feel the weight of the board that had killed Mr. Schorr and smashed Dora 's arm and fallen across George 's legs but , by some miracle , had done no more than bruise his ankles . Leaning on the basin in this strange house on Westerlo Street , George wished he was back on Fourth Street . At least there , when the nightmare struck , he could give in to the horror . On Fourth Street he did n't have to worry about being caught vomiting by two 15 01strange people like Uncle Zisha and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to Albany that he started to cry . He cried with his mouth open , so the sobs would make less noise , and his forehead bounced up and clown on the cool enamel . He cried because he was afraid and he was lonely and he did n't understand this strange brother of Aunt Tessie 's who talked so loud and ate so much and laughed so hard . After a while the sobs stopped . George straightened up and , by running the hot and cold water for a few minutes , he managed to clean up the basin . He was brushing his teeth when a sound outside brought him to the window . Ills room looked down on a large , square , paved yard into which the driveway that ran along the side of the house opened . The far side of the yard ended against a loading platform at one end of a long two-story gray building that was obviously Uncle Zisha 's factory . A large truck was backed up to the loading platform . What had brought George to the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they stacked the truck with cases of , bottled soda that came pouring slowly out of the factory on a narrow metal treadmill . George watched the men for a while , and then realized all at once that his stomach was all right . He turned back to the room . He saw for the first time that , over the bed , there was a picture of Judge Brandeis . It was less formal than the pictures in the dining room and the living room downstairs . This picture had been cut from a newspaper . It showed Judge Brandeis on the platform of a railroad station , smiling at several people who had come either to greet him or to to say farewell . George wondered what it was with Uncle Zisha and this Judge Brandeis . he was surprised that Aunt Tessie had not mentioned it . " George ! " He jumped nervously , then went to the door and opened it . " Yes ? " " Come on ! " Uncle Zisha shouted . " It 's time to take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of machines into which men in rubber aprons at one end fed long rows of empty , freshly washed bottles . They came out at the other end , full of different-colored liquids . Other men slapped labels on the bottles as they went by , and still others shoved the bottles into wooden cases . These were dumped on the metal treadmill that carried them out to the loading plat- 151 1form , where they went either directly into waiting trucks , like the one George had seen from his bedroom window , or into storage sheds at the other side of the paved yard . All of it was interesting , especially the machines that filled the bottles , but what George found most interesting was Uncle Zisha . He moved about among the machines and the men who tended them the way he had moved across the railroad station with George 's suitcase : in long , loping , sure-footed strides , bellowing orders above the roar of the machines , never pausing for a backward look to see if his orders were being carried out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dwarf even the huge machines . " So all right , " Uncle Zisha said , stopping suddenly and turning on George . " Which part do you like best ? " " I do n't know , " George said . " It 's all so  --  so --  " Uncle Zisha laughed . " Come on , " he said . " I 'll show you the part Zisha Hurst likes best . " He led George around the machines to the office at one side . The bookkeeper , an old man with a green eye shade , was clearing a wooden table near his desk . Through the open door George saw that the yard was suddenly full of trucks . The drivers were coming into the office , chatting , lighting cigarettes , and calling greetings to the bookkeeper and Uncle Zisha as they formed a crude line iii front of the table . When the bookkeeper was ready , the first driver handed over a batch of slips . The bookkeeper added them up on a machine at his elbow . Then , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll of money from his pocket and began counting it out on the table . When the sum agreed with the bookkeeper 's total , he shoved the money across the table toward Uncle Zisha , who sorted it out according to denomination . " The collections , " he said to George with a grin . " This is the part Zisha Hurst likes best . " He laughed . The bookkeeper and the drivers laughed with him . By the time the last man had turned in his collections , some of the piles of money in front of Uncle Zisha were as high as Miss Corcoran'sdictionary . " On Fourth Street , " Uncle Zisha said as he strapped rubberbands around the bundles of bills , " you ever saw money like this ? " He laughed again as he shoved the bundles of money into acanvas bag , poured in all the coins except the pennies , and lockedthe bag away in a wall safe . The pennies were swept into a paper 152 lbag which Uncle Zisha handed to George . " You carry it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . Such a feeling every person should learn . " Out in the yard , where all the trucks were now parked for the night , Uncle Zisha stopped in front of a pile of cases full of empty bottles . He looked through them quickly , found one he wanted , and pulled it out . " You see this ? " he said , holding the bottle toward George . " See what it says on the side ? Not Hurst Bottling Works . It says Star Bottling Works . This Star , soda he makes it taste like ink , but there 's all kinds dopes in the world , and some of them like to drink ink , so Star sells a few bottles here in Albany , too . Me , I give my customers the bottles for nothing . They want to give them back ? All right , thank you , Zisha Hurst takes them , and I fill them up again . They do n't want to give them back ? All right again , keep them , it 's a present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Star , he shivers so hard he should get his bottles back , his customers they have to give him a deposit , a nickel on every bottle , and when they give back the bottle , he gives them back the nickel . Some of those nickel bottles , they come back to me by mistake , like this one . " Uncle Zisha held it up for George to see again , then dropped it into the case . " You like the way that money feels in your hand ? " He tapped the paper bag full of pennies . George nodded . He had never held so much money at one time . There must have been six or seven hundred pennies in the bag . " So all right , " Uncle Zisha said . " Rememberwhat I just told you about these Star bottles , and tomorrow I 'll show you how you can start getting rich yourself , just like Zisha Hurst ! " He laughed and put his hand around George 's shoulders . " But first let 's go see what Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a roast turkey with dumplings . Before they sat down to it , however , Uncle Zisha opened the drawstring of the yellow canvas sack that served as a door stop in the dining room . The sack was full of pennies . " Go ahead , " Uncle Zisha said , and he laughed when he saw the expression on George 's face . He tapped the paper sack George had carried across from the factory . " Dump them in ! " After dinner , which like the midday meal was eaten in complete silence , Mrs. Gerstenberger cleared the table and removed the cloth . Uncle Zisha hoisted the yellow canvas sack up onto the 153 ltable , opened the drawstring , and poured . The pennies came spilling out on the polished mahogany like a flood of dirty honey . From a drawer in the sideboard Uncle Zisha brought a stack of small pink bank wrappers . " What you do at night on Fourth Street , I do n't know , " Uncle Zisha said with a grin . " But up here in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll sit here , and you do like I do . " Deftly , using his long , thick fingers as a rake , he showed George how to slide five pennies at a time out of the spilled mass of coins . When he had fifty bunched together in a small pile , Uncle Zisha stacked them in a tiny column , took the column between thumb and forefinger , placed it on its side on one of the pink wrappers , and rolled the paper neatly around the coins . He crimped the wrapper at both ends to seal the tube , tapped the ends sharply on the table to make the creases hold , set the fifty-cent roll of pennies aside , and started on another . After a few minutes , during which he spilled several stacks while trying to place them on their sides , George got the hang of it . Soon he was working almost as quickly as Uncle Zisha . When she finished the dishes , Mrs. Gerstenberger came in and joined them . She did it without a word , placing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place where George and Uncle Zisha sat facing each other . It was as though either she or Uncle Zisha , or perhaps both of them , did not want the relationship of employer and employee to be blurred even in this group activity . The separationhad no effect , however , on the warm team feeling that filled the room . They were working , George felt , in a common cause . He had not felt so good for a long time . He was so absorbed by the work that he did not notice when Uncle Zisha started to talk . After he did notice , several minutes went by before George realized Uncle Zisha was telling about his early days in America . " Tessie came over first because she was older , " the big man said . " When she got off the ship there on Ellis Island , where does she go , where ? To Fourth Street . And why ? Because on Fourth Street there was living a lot of other Austrians . She did n't know them . In Austria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard before , not once . But because they 're Austrians , and because they live on Fourth Street , so my sister Tessie , she , too , she has to go live on Fourth Street ! If God forbid Tessie she came from Poland , so now she 'd be living on that verkockte Ninth Street there 154in New York , because Polacks the minute they got off the ship , right away they go where other Polacks go . Or if worse yet Tessie she came God forbid from Russia , now she 'd be living on Seventh Street , because Russians they 're like sheep , too . The minute they get off the ship , quick , like a wild animal was chasing them , they run to the same place where oilier Russians arc living ! " Uncle Zisha tapped down the creases of a tube of pennies and placed it on the growing pile in the middle of the table . " But mc , no ! " lie said firmly . " Like a sheep , to go where other sheep go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His powerful fingers began to rake out the pennies for a new stack . " The fourth year she 's here in America , when Tessie sends me the money I should come , Zisha Hurst is ready to go , believe me ! Four years the army took already out of my life , and to go again another four years to clean up after horses and eat brown bread with onions for Franz Josef , this is a bargain ? No , thank you ! Not for Zisha Hurst ! I took the money Tessie sent me , and I bought a ticket , and to Franz Josef and to Austria it 's good-bye Charlie ! Zisha Hurst is going to America ! " He paused , and he looked up at the picture of Judge Brandeis on the wall , and his large face broke into the small crinkly pieces of his extraordinary smile . " Tessie was waiting for me , " Uncle Zisha said . " A greenhorn , a baby , not yet twenty-one years old , I get off from the ship in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tessie , she 's waiting ! " He shook his head slowly . " To have somebody waiting , when you get off from a ship or a train , in the whole world there 's only a few things like that , and those few things I 'm not sure they 're nicer ! " He paused again . George wondered guiltily if Uncle Zisha was drawing a parallel between his arrival in America all those years ago and George 's arrival in Albany that morning . " My sister Tessie , from the ship , she brings Zisha Hurst home , " Uncle Zisha said . " I take one look at what my sister Tessie she calls home , and right away I think here in America Tessie she 's become a joker . This is a home ? Two holes in the wall ? In back , there , by a store where she presses pants ? On a street with ash cans standing on the sidewalk ? With garbage pails right there under your nose instead of fresh air ? With houses made of stone they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people living on top of each other in little holes like shirts in bureau drawers ? With a street that it 155 1ends in a dock , there , with lumber and coal wagons ? This is a home , Zisha Hurst says to his sister Tessie ? This is my home , she says . Stop with the jokes , Zisha Hurst says . Show me where you live , he says . You 're looking at it , Tessie says . Zisha Hurst takes another look at that Fourth Street outside , and he says no ! " Uncle Zisha slapped his hand down on the table , hard . The pool of pennies shivered and spread wider across the polished mahogany . " Not for Zisha Hurst ! " he said . " To live on that verkockte Fourth Street , for this Zisha Hurst did n't eat herring and black bread twenty-eight days in the bottom of a ship ! For this Zisha Hurst did n't leave Austria ! From America Zisha Hurst expected something better ! " He paused once more , and his booming voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And from America Zisha Hurst got something better ! Tessie said I was crazy . She said I 'd get killed . She said I was a greenhorn , I could n't speak yet a word English , I would n't know what to ask or where to go or how to do ! She was right ! A greenhorn I was ! A word English I could n't speak ! What to ask or where to go or how to do , I did n't know ! But I was in America ! That 's all Zisha Hurst had to know ! " He laughed happily and , for a while , Uncle Zisha stared across George 's head at the picture of Judge Brandeis on the wall . George could tell that the big man at the other side of the table was no longer there . Uncle Zisha had returned to a glowing moment in the past . " I walked away from Fourth Street , " he said finally . " On my own two feet , the greenhorn feet he brought from Austria , Zisha Hurst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped walking , two months later , I knew one thing for sure : a mistake I did n't make ! From New York here to Albany this morning in a train you came in a few hours . Thirty-five years ago the same trip it took Zisha Hurst two months . But what a two months ! Every day , pure gold ! Every person he met , a doll ! Every piece brcacl he ate , sponge cake ! Every place he slept , a palace ! Every job he took , a pleasure ! This was America ! This was what Zisha Hurst came to sec and get ! " Uncle Zisha laughed as he swept his large hand out in a gesture that took in the room , the house , the factory outside , the mound of pennies on the table. 1 56 " And he got it ! " he said . " Zisha Hurst got what he came for . " He laughed again . " It did n't come in a minute . Even in America the only things that they come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay away ! Zisha Hurst had to work , and he worked hard , and there was nights , believe mc , plenty of them , when he wondered sometimes where the next day he 'd get his breakfast . But one thing he never had to wonder , because this is America , one thing Zisha Hurst never had to wonder was if he 'd get breakfast ! From the day he came to America , Zisha Hurst always ate good ! " IIe was eating again when George came downstairs the next morning . Not until Mrs. Gerstenberger had set a large bowl of oatmealin front of him did George realize that , for the first time since Armistice Day , he had slept soundly through a whole night , without waking up out of the familiar nightmare wet with sweat . George sat quite still , waiting tensely for the terror to come creeping back , but it did n't . After several moments , very cautiously , he picked up his spoon . He took a tentative mouthful of oatmeal , and had a moment of astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It tasted even better . George dipped hungrily over the bowl . When he looked up again , he saw both Uncle Zisha and Mrs. Gerstenberger watching him with pleased smiles . " Those ten pounds , " Uncle Zisha said to his housekeeper . " It looks like maybe to stick them on him we wo n't have so much trouble ! " Mrs. Gerstenberger giggled shyly and brought George another bowl of oatmeal . After breakfast he drove to the bank with Uncle Zisha to make the deposit that had been locked away in the safe the night before . Then they returned to the factory yard , where Uncle Zisha proved he had not been joking when he 'd said the night before that he would show George how to get rich out of Star bottles . Every morning after that , when they came back from the bank and Uncle Zisha disappeared into the factory to spend the morning bellowing orders , George tackled the cases of empties that the drivers had unloaded and stacked in the storage shed the night before . He combed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned by mistake to the Hurst factory . Every morning he found anywhere from five or six to a couple of dozen . If there were too many to carry , George loaded them into a small handcartUncle Zisha had said he could use , and trundled them out of the 157 lyard and down Westerlo Street to Dougherty 's Ice Cream Parlor at the foot of the hill . Even though Dougherty 's was so close to the Hurst Soda Bottling Works , Mrs. Dougherty bought her soda pop from Star , which used only deposit bottles . By pretending , as Uncle Zisha had instructed him , to be a customer who was returning empty bottles on which he had paid a deposit , George was able to get from Mrs. Dougherty a nickel each for the empties he combed out of the cases in the factory yard . At the end of his first week in Albany , when George had accumulated almost five dollars , Mrs. Dougherty became difficult . " Twelve bottles , " she said , staring suspiciously at the row of bottles George had placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't remember nobody buying no twelve bottles of cream soda . " Uncle Zisha had prepared George for this contingency . " They 're not all from my house , " he said . " Our neighbors said as long as I was going down to Dougherty 's , they asked I should take down their empties , too . " " What neighbors ? " " Mrs. Cushing and Mrs. Teilheit . " Uncle Zisha 's briefing had been thorough . " Where do you live , boy ? " George jerked his thumb across his shoulder , trying for the touch of casual authority he found so impressive in Uncle Zisha . " South Pearl Street . " " South Pearl , and you come all the way over here to Westerlo for cream soda ? " Mrs. Dougherty said . " What 's the matter with Grainger 's ? " " Grainger 's ? They sell only that lousy Hurst soda , " George said with a straight face . " Up at our house , we like Star . Mrs. Cushing and Mrs. Teilheit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " all right , but now look . I ca n't keep taking all these empties . I 'm not saying they did n't come from here . All I 'm saying , I 'll tell you what . " She gave him a sharp glance . George , who knew he was tall for his age , knew also that Mrs. Dougherty was trying to figure how smart or stupid he was . " I 'll give you half in cash , and half in trade . " She nodded toward the row of bottles on the counter . " Twelve bottles , a nickel apiece , that 's sixty cents . I 'll give you thirty cents in cash , and the rest you take in trade . How about it ? " 158 lIt was George 's first contact with the theory about half a loaf . " Okay , " he said . He took the three dimes and hesitated for some time over the candy racks before he chose three ten-cent Oh Henrys . He ate one on the way back up the hill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a small salami . By the time George reached the house , the other two did not feel very attractive in his pocket . In fact , George felt like throwing them away . He would have done just that if Mrs. Gerstenberger had not opened the front door at that moment to shake out her dust mop . George went upstairs , added the three dimes to his other savings in the Prince Albert tobacco tin that served as his safe , and put the two Oh Henrys in his bureau drawer . By the end of his second week in Albany , when the time came for him to leave , George had piled up $7.95 in the tobacco tin and thirty-seven Oh Henrys in his bureau drawer . He packed them all carefullyunder his jumpers in the bottom of his suitcase . The box lunch Mrs. Gerstenberger packed for him to eat on the train weighed almost as much as the suitcase . At the front door , which Mrs. Gerstenberger was holding open so George could follow Uncle Zisha out to the Buick , the housekeeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day George arrived in Albany . She brushed the top of his head with her round , red , pudgy hand , doing it hesitantly , as though , knowing her clumsy movements might shatter something priceless and fragile , she nevertheless could not resist touching it . George ducked , and then stopped short . Great big tears were rolling clown the fat German woman 's cheeks . Staring at her in astonishment , George suddenly felt the way he did when Miss Corcoran called on him in class for an answer to a problem he had not realized , until he got up on his feet , he did not understand . In his mind he was suddenly clawing desperately back through all the facts , hoping by rearranging them to find the answer he had missed in his first attempt . All at once he could see himself as he had been two weeks ago , an awkward visitor from another world , living with a terror that woke him in the night and closed down on him without warning during the day , completely absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Tessie had committed him from learning his humiliating secret . For two weeks he had spent his days going to the bank with Uncle Zisha , combing the empties in the factory yard for Star bottles , 159 accumulating a small fortune in coins and a hoard of Oh Henrys , watching Uncle Zisha eat his enormous meals , listening to him praise the still unidentified judge Brandeis , helping him count pennies out of the yellow canvas sack that propped open the dining-room door and roll them into tubes of fifty . Somewhere in the background of that busy time the shy , redfacedGerman woman had moved on her large but surprisingly quiet feet , bringing in food , making beds , helping to roll pennies , washing clothes . George had accepted her as he had accepted Uncle Zisha 's furniture , something to be used while be was a guest in Uncle Zisha 's world . But George had never given her a thought , except when he wanted something , and he had never spoken to her , except to ask for what he wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught him to be polite , but it had been an empty ceremony , like brushing your teeth , something you did automatically , without thought . It had never occurred to George that he had meant any more to Mrs. Gerstenbergcr than she had meant to him , that he was anything more to her than another piece of furniture , as it were , that it was part of her job to dust and keep tidy . If she had not been standing in the doorway right now , he would have left the house without saying good-bye to her . But she was standing in the doorway , and she was n't acting like a piece of furniture . She was crying her eyes out , making no effort to keep her round , shapeless body from shaking with sobs , and all at once there was a strange feeling in George 's chest . He did n't like it , because it was painful , and he did n't understand it . He stared at Mrs. Gerstenbergerhelplessly , swallowing hard , and she stared back at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned . It was Uncle Zisha , calling from the Buick . " I 'm coming ! " He turned back to Mrs. Gerstenbergcr and , with a quick , awkward , hesitant gesture , not unlike the way she had patted the top of his head , George touched her hand , turned again , and ran out of the house . For several minutes after the car jerked away from the front ofthe house , Uncle Zisha was silent . Then , soon after he turned intoPearl Street , he uttered a loud grunt . " Say ! " he said . " Take a look ! " George looked . Uncle Zisha was pulling the car up to the curb 16o in front of a store with a long plate-glass window in which a beautiful red car was on display . " Come on , " Uncle Zisha said , getting out of the Buick . George followed him into the store . A salesman came out of the back , his eyebrows arched inquiringly . Uncle Zisha pointed to the car in the window . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " Why , yes , " he said . " Cer-tainly . " " how much ? " Uncle Zisha said . The salesman pulled a piece of paper from his pocket , consulted it , and then mentioned a figure . Uncle Zisha unbuttoned his long black overcoat and dug down into his pocket . He pulled out the canvas sack into which the deposit had been stuffed the night before , opened it , and started counting out twenty-dollar bills . " Just a moment , sir , " the salesman said in a startled voice . " Would n't it be simpler if  --  ? " " Who has a moment ? " Uncle Zisha said . " And who needs it simpler ? This is my nephew George . I Ie 's going home to New York . I do n't want he should forget that for the first time in his life he 's been in America . I want hint to remember that there 's more in America than that verkocktc Fourth Street . I do n't want he should bury himself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to live . I want him to grow up understanding America is a big place , and a piece of it belongs to anybody who wants to take it . I want him to be something I never got a chance to be because I came to America too late . I want him to be like Judge Brandeis . All these things I want him to remember . If I drive him to the station in a car like this one in the window , maybe he 'll remember better . " George felt the way the salesman looked . He could n't decide whether Uncle Zisha was serious or joking . " You mean , sir , " the salesman said nervously , " you 'd like to drive this car to the station right now ? " " What else ? " Uncle Zisha said as he continued to count out bills from the canvas bag . " My nephew George has a train to catch . " " But sir , " the salesman said . " We 'll have to unhinge our front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --  " Uncle Zisha stopped counting out money . " A question , please , " he said . " This car , here . You want to sell it ? " " Of course , sir . But  --  " " So start with the door unhinging , " Uncle Zisha said as he resumedpeeling off twenty-dollar bills . " And go get some gas . " 161 A half hour later , he and George were rolling down Pearl Street in the bright red car . George was confused . He sensed that a good deal of what Uncle Zisha had said to the salesman had actually been directed at him . But George did n't understand most of it . The part about Judge Brandeis was particularly baffling . Aside from the fact that Uncle Zisha had made it clear over and over again during the past two weeks that Judge Brandeis was his hero , George still did not know who the judge was . This was the first time he 'd heard that Uncle Zisha had wanted to be like the judge , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all was the fact that , having made all these baffling remarks to the salesman , Uncle Zisha had not added a word of clarification to George after they left the salesroom . In fact , Uncle Zisha did not speak until they reached the station , and he had parked the car , and he had carried George 's bag into the waiting train . After the suitcase was safely tucked away in the rack overhead , and the box lunch and George 's cap were on the seat Uncle Zisha had chosen for him , the big man led George out to the platform . " There 's yet a few minutes to wait , " Uncle Zisha said . " It 's better to wait out here in the fresh clean air . The dirty air from Fourth Street you 'll be breathing soon enough . " George would have preferred to wait in the train . He was afraid somebody would take his seat . " These whole two weeks you were here , " Uncle Zisha said . " It 's funny you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " For a moment George was n't sure he had heard correctly . Then he saw the look on Uncle Zisha 's face and George realized not only that he had heard correctly , but also how far he had come in the two weeks since he had climbed down from the train in this same station , and , up in his room after his first meal in Albany , had burst into sobs . Everything was different now . The terror was gone . He could think about Danny and Dora and what had happened in the Forest on Armistice Day without getting sick and beginning to sweat . " Well , I do n't know , " George said . " Danny and I , we never wrote any letters to each other before . " " But before you were never away from Fourth Street , " Uncle Zisha said . " So why should he write you letters ? " " I guess maybe Danny does n't feel like writing letters , " George said . " What happened in the Forest , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightmare that would have assailed him two weeks ago at the mere thought of what had hap- 162pened , George heard himself telling Uncle Zisha all about it . After he described how Danny 's father had been killed by the falling lumber and how Dora 's arm had been crushed , George even pulled down his stocking and showed Uncle Zisha the small scars on his ankle where the heavy board had held him pinned to the Forest floor until help came . It did not occur to George until much later , when he was halfway to New York , that the explanation had been completely unnecessary , because Aunt Tessie must have written Uncle Zisha all about it . If she had n't , how would Uncle Zisha have known about Danny ? " You like this Danny ? " Uncle Zisha said . George gave him a quick glance . Aunt Tessie had obviously written more than a description of what had happened on the dock on Armistice Day . Aunt Tessie had obviously told Uncle Zisha about Danny and Gerrity 's saloon and what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He 's my friend , " George said . Uncle Zisha 's large , handsome face was expressionless . " A good friend ? " " Danny 's the best friend I 've got . " Uncle Zisha nodded . " Then you should n't be afraid to say so . Do n't be like my sister Tessie . She 's afraid . " The fact that George found this bit of information surprising , and did n't believe it , must have been clear on his face . Uncle Zisha nodded firmly . " Nobody knows better than Zisha Hurst how afraid his sister Tessie is , " the big man said . " She 's afraid of the world . She 's afraid of people . That 's why she hides there in those two rooms on Fourth Street . That 's why she never comes here to Albany to visit her own brother . That 's why she hates your friend Danny for going with shkutzim . She 's afraid to come out of her hole and look at the rest of America . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is . " Uncle Zisha shook his head . " Do n't be like my sister Tessie , " he said . " Do n't be afraid of the world . Do n't be afraid of people . And you 'll grow up to be like Judge Brandeis ! " The conductor called an unintelligible warning . Uncle Zisha 's grave face broke into the crinkly pieces of his wonderful smile . He put his large , heavy hand on George 's shoulder and they walked to the train step , side by side . " The seven dollars and ninety-five cents that you got from theX63 Star bottles , " Uncle Zisha said . " What are you going to do with it ? " George hesitated . He had n't made any plans for the $7.95 . He 'd been thinking he would talk it over with Danny . " I do n't know , " George said cautiously . " I mean I have n't thought about it . " " So think about maybe this , " Uncle Zisha said . " College ? Law school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he was talking about , because the big man smiled and said , " To be like Judge Brandeis , the finest thing that anybody can be , a boy must go first to college and law school . College and law school , they cost money . This kind of money my sister Tessie does n't have . You have already the beginning . Seven dollars and ninety-five cents . If you decide to spend that money to become like Judge Brandeis , then Zisha Hurst will pay the rest . " The big man stopped and waited . He looked the way he always looked , but George felt a difference . Uncle Zisha seemed tense . It was as though George 's reply was very important to him . " Thanks , " George said . It did n't seem like much of an answer , but it was more than enough for Uncle Zisha . The big man beamed . " The thanks they 're all on my side , " he said . " To do this will be for Zisha Hurst a pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a hand in his overcoat pocket , pulled out a flat package , and handed it to George . " A little present , " he said . " To help you remember . " " Thanks , " George said again . He climbed up onto the train platform . Uncle Zisha put out his hand . George took it . They shook bands formally . Then , for a terrible moment , as he found he could not tug his hand free and he saw a sudden , unexpected gleam in Uncle Zisha 's eyes , George thought the big man was going to cry . The moment passed , however , and as the train started to move , George realized how crazy it had been to have such a thought . Uncle Zisha was smiling as he walked along with the slowly moving train . " Do n't forget ! " he called in his booming voice . " Do n't forget  --  " He paused as though he could n't decide what it was he wanted George not to forget , and then Uncle Zisha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't ! " George called back , not quite knowing what he was n't supposed to forget . Then , as Uncle Zisha took off his black Homburg X64 1and raised it in a salute , George remembered Mrs. Gerstenberger , and the small , painful feeling was suddenly back in his chest . He went to his seat and sat down and opened the package Uncle Zisha had given him . It contained a picture of Judge Brandeis in a silver frame . George stared at it for a while , wondering what to do with it , and then he realized he was hungry . He put aside the picture of Judge Brandeis and picked up Mrs. Gerstenberger 's lunch box . By the time he had it open , the painful feeling was gone . George had forgotten all about it . I-Ic was thinking , as he bit into a fried chicken leg , what Danny 's face would look like when George gave him the thirty-seven Oh Henrys . Since George had never been away from home until he went to visit Uncle Zisha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he experienced for the first time in his life the series of shocks that add up to a homecoming . The first one took place in Grand Central , where Aunt T'essie had come to meet him . " So what 's already with the eyes big like garbage-can covers ? " she said . " I 'm all of a sudden growing ice-cream cones out of my ears , maybe ? " George had forgotten how ugly she was . Then she smiled , and he forgot again . " No , " George said . " I was just remembering something Uncle Zisha said . " Aunt Tessie 's smile disappeared . " It was about me ? " Her voice was sharp . George nodded . Aunt Tcssie said , " What did he say ? " " He was telling me about when he came to America and he got off the ship and you were waiting for him . In the whole world , Uncle Zisha said , there are only a few things that are better than that , better than to have somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train , he meant , and he was n't even sure , he said , that those few things were better . " Aunt Tessie 's face got red , and for several minutes , from theX65 Jway she hustled him across the railroad station to the waiting room , George thought she was sore . He had not wanted to make her sore . He had wanted merely to steer her away from what he knew was bound to come up next , her favorite subject : what a no-good bum Danny Schorr was , and how George would be much better off if he never went near that little shkutz lover again and made friends instead with like maybe a hungry snake or a wild Indian . " What else did he have to say ? " Aunt Tessie said when they were in the subway . " This brother of mine with the great big mouth ? " George was glad to see the trick had worked . He did n't want to have any arguments about Danny . " Uncle Zisha said he wants to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants me to become another Judge Brandeis . " " This is bad ? " Aunt Tessie said . " Who said it 's bad ? " " All of a sudden you have a face long like a clothesline . " " He did n't tell me who Judge Brandeis is . " Aunt Tessie nodded . " If my brother Zisha in that factory of his he made ships instead of soda water , he 'd be so busy picking out the fanciest paint , he 'd forget to put in the engines . Let him pay for the law school , and me , I 'll tell you who Judge Brandeis is . " She did , in elaborate detail , while the subway train carried them downtown . George was impressed and relieved . All the way from Albany he had been uneasy about Uncle Zisha 's parting wish . If he 'd wanted George to become another Babe Ruth or Jack Dempsey , that would have made sense . These , or rather they , were recognizablemarks to shoot at . But Judge Brandeis was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk Uncle Zisha was nuts about but nobody else had time for . How would it have looked to tell Danny and Dora or Miss Corcoran or anybody else that he wanted to grow up to be another Mr. Joe Schmuck ? Now , with Aunt Tessie 's explanationunder his belt , George could stop worrying . In fact , as the subway train rattled him and Aunt Tessie along on the way home to Fourth Street , George began to feel proud that Uncle Zisha thought he had enough stuff on the ball to become another Judge Brandeis . He sensed vaguely that he was committing himself to an ambition that would absorb all his best efforts for the rest of his life , and the size of the undertaking frightened him a little , but it also made him feel safe . It was like living from day to day in different places from which you were tossed out every night and then , all at once , dis- 166 covering that you had a permanent address . Now George knew what to say to people when they asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Uncle Zisha 's house , " Aunt Tessie said suddenly . " It 's big ? " George , who had been thinking about Danny and wondering how soon he could get to see him , was taken by surprise . " Pretty big , " he said . " What 's by you pretty ? " Aunt Tessie said . " Well , it 's a whole house . " " P.S. 188 is a whole house , too . How many floors ? " Iwo . " " With the ground floor two ? " " No , there 's two over the ground floor . " " For one man , he lives alone , a house with three floors he needs ? " " Uncle Zisha does n't live alone . " Aunt Tessie gave George a quick glance . " So who lives with him , who ? " " Mrs. Gerstenberger . " Aunt Tessie made a gesture of annoyance . " This is the housekeeper , no ? " " Sure , but she lives in the house . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You 're sure ? " " Sure I 'm sure . " " The whole two weeks you were there , nobody else slept in the house ? " " Nobody . " " Only you and Uncle Zisha and this Mrs. Gerstenberger ? " " That 's all . " The train stopped at Astor Place . Aunt Tessie and George got out . They waited for the Tenth Street crosstown and , when they were seated in the trolley car , Aunt Tessie stared thoughtfully for a long time at the boy in the yellow slicker in the Uneeda Biscuit ad . " What time in Albany did you go to sleep at night ? " she demandedabruptly . " About ten o'clock , " George said . " Every night ? " " Pretty nearly . " 167 " What 's with the pretty nearly ? " " A couple of times , after we finished rolling pennies  --  " " Rolling what ? " George explained how the hours after dinner were spent on Westerlo Street . " So every night , after the rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Except these two times , when we quit early , around eight o'clock . " " Why ? " " Uncle Zisha had to see somebody on business . " " Who ? " " How should I know ? " " Who else should know ? I was in Albany ? Or you ? " " I did n't see who it was , " George said . " I went upstairs to my room , and this person , Uncle Zisha saw him downstairs in the living room . " " It was a him ? " " I guess so . " " Again with the guessing ? " " Well , Jesus , Aunt Tessie  --  " " The Jesus you could leave in Albany . Here you talk plain English . " " All I 'm trying to tell you is , I did n't see who it was . " " It could have been , then , a woman ? " George blinked up at the Uneeda Biscuit ad in astonishment . The thought had never occurred to him before . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Me you 're asking ? " George shook his head . " It could n't have been a woman . " " Why not ? " " Because Uncle Zisha said it was somebody he had to see on business . " " Some business . After supper , nine o'clock at night , with everybodyquick go upstairs out of the way ! " " Mrs. Gerstenberger was n't out of the way . She sleeps down-stairs . " " And Uncle Zisha , where does he sleep ? " " Downstairs . " Aunt Tessie pursed her lips . She did n't unpurse them until the 168 trolley car dropped her and George at the corner of Tenth Street and Avenue C. They started walking down toward Fourth . " Where downstairs ? " Aunt Tessie said suddenly . " Where downstairs what ? " " Mrs. Gerstenberger . Where does she sleep ? " " Downstairs in the back . She has a big room behind the kitchen . " " It 's far from Uncle Zisha 's room ? " " Not too far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She seemed to be counting the cracks in the sidewalk as they passed over them . " What does she look like ? " she said finally . " Mrs. Gerstenberger ? " George described Uncle Zisha 's housekeeper . " And the cooking ? " George described that , too . " He likes her ? " George did n't know what to say . This was another thought that had never entered his mind before . " What 's so hard to answer ? " Aunt Tessie said irritably . " You know what it means to like someone . he likes her or he does n't ? " " He makes her sit at the other end of the table . " " When you 're eating ? " " No , when we 're rolling pennies . " George described the evening ritual and the places all the parties to it had occupied while performing it . Aunt Tessie listened attentively , with a small frown , and finally shook her head . " It does n't mean nothing , " she said gloomily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table make her sit far away just to fool you . " " What would he want to fool me about ? " " Never mind , " Aunt Tessie said . George did n't get a chance to mind because , just then , they turned the corner into Fourth Street and he had his second shock . " What 's the matter with you ? " Aunt Tessie said as he stopped short . George did n't know how to tell her . East Fourth Street seemed to have shrunk . Two weeks ago , when he left for Albany , it had been a broad highway . Now it was a narrow alley . " I was just looking around . " " Look around tomorrow , " Aunt Tessie said . " Today , it 's already late , we need a bag of coal . " X69 George was glad to hear it . He did n't want Aunt Tessie keeping him in the house with a lot of questions about how he felt and what had happened in Albany . George wanted to find Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance . " I better hurry , " he said . When they came into the store , he stopped again . The two rooms looked so small that George could n't believe he and Aunt Tessie actually lived in them . " What 's the matter ? " she said again . " Nothing , " George said . He was thinking of his room on the second floor of Uncle Zisha 's big house on the hill . " If it 's nothing then you do n't have to stand in the middle of the room like a lamppost , " Aunt Tessie said . " Take off the clothes . In your good suit you do n't go to get coal . " She opened his suitcase and started to unpack it . George began to take off his good suit . " Just because Uncle Zisha has a whole house , with big rooms , and everything it 's fancy-shmancy , " Aunt Tessie said , " it does n't mean it 's better than Fourth Street . " George could feel his face get hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you did n't say , " Aunt Tessie said . " But I know what you 're thinking . Everybody thinks like that when they come home from some place . In a little while , a few hours , a day , by tomorrow night , these rooms they wo n't look like egg boxes , and Fourth Street it 'll be just as big again like it was when you went away . " She shot him a glance out of the corner of her eye . " Even your Aunt Tessie by tomorrow she 'll look all right again ! " She kissed him quickly and then pushed him toward the door . " So if we 're not going to freeze tomorrow , the coal we 'll have to get today . " A few minutes later , down in the cellar , dragging out the beat-up old baby carriage in which he brought the coal from the dock , George suddenly began to think it was funny that Aunt Tessie had not even mentioned Danny . It was possible that she 'd forgotten , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not things like her hatred for Danny Schorr . George figured he 'd better quit fooling around and get on the ball . He pulled the carriage up into the back yard , left it near the cellar entrance , ran up the stone steps to the fifth floor , and knocked on the door. 170 A fat woman with a mole on her chin opened it . " What ? " she said . George had never seen her before . " Where 's Danny ? " " What Danny ? " she said . " There 's no Danny here . " " Schorr , " George said . " Danny Schorr . " The woman 's face cleared . " Oh , Schorr , " she said . " They do n't live here no more . Mr. Schorr was killed . An accident on the dock . Here is now Sternshus . Last week we moved in . " George was only vaguely aware that there was some connection between the shocks he had already experienced since meeting Aunt T'essie in Grand Central and the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of the shock . He felt the wallop all the way down in his toes . It had not occurred to him until this moment that , with the death of Mr. Schorr , Danny could not continue living in the same rooms on the fifth floor . Why had n't he thought of it before ? Where were his brains ? You could n't live in a place unless you had the money to pay the rent . " Where does he live now ? " George said . " Who ? " the woman said . " Danny . " The woman 's fat face creased with sudden anger . " Go ask the shkutzim over there by that Gerrity 's ! " She slammed the door . Feeling uneasy , as though he were walkinginto an ambush , George went back down to the yard and got the baby carriage . Something was up . Something lousy . He shoved the carriage out to Lewis Street , crossed over , and moved down the dock . When he reached the gate that separated the Forest from O'Brien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal up toward Lewis . " Look who 's back , " Doodoo said . " Kid Schmutz . " " In your hat and over your cars , " George said , without stopping . " Seen your boy friend yet ? " Doodoo called . George did n't turn . He kept right on going . To hell with this Doodoo bastard , he thought . This Doodoo bastard 's voice came after him . " Take a look in Gerrity 's , " he yelled . " You shkutz-loving son of a bitch ! You and him both ! " George did n't have to take a look in Gerrity 's . A few minutes later , after George had bought his sack of coal and was shoving it back up toward Lewis , Danny suddenly stepped out of Gerrity 's side door , directly in front of George . There was something about1 171 Danny that made George stop short , the way he 'd stopped short in Grand Central when he first clapped eyes on Aunt Tessie . It was another one of those shocks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than George remembered him . " Hi , " Danny said . " When 'd you get back ? " " A few minutes ago , " George said , and then , because he did n't want Danny to think he had n't tried to find him immediately , he said , " I had to go get coal . " " Yeah , " Danny said , and without warning he added sharply , " What the hell you looking at ? " George was n't sure . Iie 'd known Danny ever since the day Aunt Tessie had brought him to Fourth Street from the Henry Isaacs Orphan Asylum . The fact that they had been born on exactly the same day had always seemed to George more than a coincidence . It had made him think of Danny almost as his twin brother . For six years Danny had been as much a part of his life as Aunt Tessie herself . Yet now , two short weeks after George had last seen him , Danny could have been a total stranger . He seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as though up to now he had been a cardboard cutout with fuzzy edges and , while George had been away , somebody had taken a pair of scissors and trimmed away the fuzz . " Nothing , " George said . " It 's just I 'm glad to sec you . " What he saw was a bright , strong , clean-cut face with restless brown eyes that were in constant motion , twisting right and left , like a flashlight beam probing for something , the location of which the owner was n't quite sure . Danny suddenly reminded George of the stove in the kitchen when Aunt Tessie got the fire going good . Danny seemed to be glowing . You could almost feel it . You could also feel yourself being drawn toward it , the way a carpet tack is drawn toward a magnet . George 's heart jumped . For the first time in the six years of his friendship with Danny he understood something of its nature . It was a matter of pride . He had something other people did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You bring me anything ? " Danny said . For a few moments , as George dug down into the baby carriage and groped for the paper bag , he could n't swallow . Danny may have grown taller . Maybe he looked different . But one thing was still the same : he had n't forgotten who his best friend was . Danny had expected George to bring him something . It made George choke up. 172 lThen his throat cleared and he handed over the bag of Oh Henrys . Danny opened the bag . " Holy Christ ! " he said . " How many ? " " Thirty-seven , " George said . Danny 's head came up . " All for me ? " George nodded . Danny laughed and said again , " Holy Christ ! " He pulled an Oh Henry from the hag , stripped away the wrapper , and took a huge bite . The way he did it made George 's mouth water . Ile thought for sure Danny would offer him one of those Oh Henrys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily , George could scarcely stand it . His stomach kept making grinding noises . But Danny did n't offer him one of the Oh Henrys . " I went upstairs first , " George said . " The fifth floor . I did n't know you moved . Where you living , Danny ? " Danny jerked his head behind him . George glanced at Gerrity 's side door , started to look back at Danny , then realized what Danny 's curt nod might mean . No wonder the fat woman with the mole on her chin had been angry . No wonder Doodoo Kashkewitz had yelled curses . No wonder Aunt Tessie had not said a word about her favorite subject . She 'd preferred to have George learn the terrible truth for himself . " What the hell you want ? " Danny said . " I should go better over to Henry Isaacs ? " He punched the words out , as though he expected a fight . George took a step backward . " I did n't say anything , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying it , " Danny said . " Your Aunt Tessie , too . Well , they can all go drop dead . I 'm not going over to live in no orphan asylum . Mike Gerrity give me a room , I take it . You got any objections ? " Objections was n't exactly the word . It was bad enough to pick up nickels and dimes by running errands for shkutzim . But living with them , actually living with them , right there in the same house , sleeping in the same beds , eating their foodGeorge shook his head . He could n't quite grasp the enormity of the horror . " No , I got no objections , " he said slowly . He was trying to reconcile the horror with the way he felt about Danny . " I do n't blame anybody does n't want to go live in Henry Isaacs . I lived there . It stinks . Anything is better than  --  " He paused . He did n't really believe that . He was saying it only because he loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was better not to say things173 llike that . God might hear you and come along and kick the tail off you . George started again . " I hope you like the Oh Henrys , " he said . " The way I got them , Uncle Zisha has this factory , see . Soda water , and his bottles they 're not like this other company , Star . So every day , when the men bring back the  --  " " Tell me later , " Danny said . " I got ta go get something for Mike . " George stood there , watching his friend hurry up Fourth Street toward Avenue D , pleased because Danny had liked the Oh Henrys , worried because he could see that by living with the shkutzim in Gerrity 's , Danny was placing a strain on their friendship that was bound to cause trouble in the future , yet not really caring too much . The future could take care of itself . What mattered right now was that he was back with Danny . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dora Dienst looked different , too . " Hello , " he said . " I 'm a cripple , " Dora said . " Cut it out . " " You do n't believe me ? Look . " Dora lifted her left arm . " What about it ? " George said . " I ca n't straighten it out . " Dora lifted her right arm to show him the difference . " This one , it 's a little crooked . I came home from the hospital yesterday . They said I 'll never be able to straighten it out . They said I 'll be a cripple till I die . " She sounded proud . For a few moments George envied her . he could see her showing the slightly crooked arm to other people , and he could see them staring in amazement , and he wished he had something like that , something that would make him stand out from other people , the way Danny stood out and the way that from now on Dora was going to stand out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm was not what had made him think she looked different . It was the way she held her body , bent forward slightly from the waist , with the shoulders hunched , as though she had a pain somewhere inside and she was holding herself together around it . With her little pointed chin and her slightly slanted eyes , the curious posture made her look like a Chinese doll cowering from a blow that might come from any direction. 174 " I saw you talking to Danny , " Dora said . " Yeah , " George said . He wondered if she had seen him give Danny the Oh Henrys . Maybe he should have divided them in half , eighteen for Danny and nineteen for Dora , or nineteen for Danny and eighteen for Dora . IIe should have brought something from Albany for Dora , too . " Danny said lie had to go get something for Mike Gerrity . " " I do n't want you should ever talk to him again , " Dora said . George blinked . " Talk to who ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of a sudden it was like those lantern slides Miss Corcoran showed once in a while about La Salle and the Discovery of the Mississippi . Everything changed with a click . All of a sudden Dora 's nice , smooth face was twisted with hate . Her braids shook as she said , " Do n't ever go near him again . You hear ? " The sick feeling he had thought he 'd left behind him in Albany was suddenly back in George 's stomach . Nothing ever stayed good , the way you wanted it . Everything always changed , the way you hated it . " Listen , " he said . " Danny ca n't help it . He 's got ta live some place . He does n't want to go live in Henry Isaacs . Orphan asylums stink . I know . If Mike Gerrity wants to give Danny a room  --  " " It is n't Mike Gerrity . " George stared at her . " I do n't care if Danny wants to live with the shkutzim , " Dora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you should ever speak to him again , he made me a cripple . Look ! " She held out her left arm . " He did it ! " she screamed . " That rotten Danny Schorr ! He did it ! He did it ! It 's his fault ! " The sick feeling began to spread inside George like a drop of ink on a blotter . Nothing ever stayed good , and it did n't help to try to keep it from going bad , but you still had to try . " No , it is n't , " he said . " It 's not Danny 's fault . It 's my fault . I was the one told you to go up on that lumber stack . I was the one sent you up there to keep an eye on the  --  " " It 's Danny 's fault ! Danny 's fault ! Danny 's fault ! " Dora closed her eyes and hit the air with her fists and stamped on the sidewalk as she shouted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saydl ! He was the one sent us into the Forest ! He was the one went to get 175 lthe shkutzim to fight Doodoo and the soldiers ! It 's his fault I 'm a cripple ! It 's his fault , his fault , his fault ! " George stood there , holding the handle of the baby carriage , letting her wild words pour over him , wondering if he was really going to be sick , and not caring very much . His mind kept going around in a circle , asking stupidly why it had to be like this ? Why could n't it be the way it had always been ? The way it had been before Armistice Day ? Him and Danny and Dora ? A few arguments once in a while , sure . Dora talking back to Danny now and then . Even George once in a while asking how come . But nothing serious . Always the three of them . Always friends . Why could n't it be like that ? " Dora , listen , " George said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the same you had to . Maybe , if you tried hard enough , you found a way . He shoved back the sick feeling and he made his voice sound nice and easy . " Dora , I brought you something from Albany . " She stopped screaming . It was like a bad rain , great big drops hammering down , and somebody had turned it off like a faucet . Dora looked at him suspiciously . She wiped the corner of her mouth with the back of her hand . " What ? " she said . George took out the money he had earned in Albany by carrying Star bottles down the hill to Mrs. Dougherty 's ice-cream parlor . " Here . " He handed over the five-dollar bill and the two singles and the coins . He had not planned it this way . He did n't want to give the money to Dora . But George did n't see that there was anything else he could do . No matter what Dora said about Danny , George knew better . He knew who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Armistice Day . He knew who was responsible for her crooked arm . " How much is it ? " Dora said . " Seven dollars and ninety-five cents . " She counted it carefully . " It 's all for me ? " George nodded . " The whole thing ? " she said . " The whole thing , " George said . Dora smiled . The sick feeling , laced tight around George 's stomach like the fingers of a clenched fist , began to lose its grip . He had found a way. 9It was not a very good way . For one thing , it was only temporary . As soon as the excitement generated by receiving $7.95 all in a lump wore off , Dora went right back to hating Danny . For another , it did nothing to ease George 's own feeling of guilt . Even while Dora was beaming because she held in her hands more money than she had ever before possessed , and as a result of such beaming she had for the moment forgotten that she hated Danny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who seemed to be able to do that was Danny himself . In the days when he had been in and out of Gerrity 's all day long , he had never cared what the people of Fourth Street thought of him for associating with shkutzim . Now that he was actually living in Gerrity 's , and the scandal was so much worse , Danny seemed to care even less . He was equally indifferent to the fact that Dora hated him . George could not understand this . There was nothing secret about Dora 's hatred . She talked about it constantly . Not to Danny , of course , but to anybody who would listen . Many people did . Nobody on Fourth Street , with the exception of George , could forgive Danny for living with the Gerritys . They enjoyed hearing a pretty little girl like Dora say aloud the things about the young shkutz lover that they were themselves afraid to say except in private , because saying them involved criticism of Mike Gerrity , who had a violent temper and would just as soon punch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dora did not limit herself to name-calling . When she saw Danny coming along the street , she would very ostentatiously move to the other side . Once , when she passed Danny in front of Gordon 's candy stand , George saw Dora spit on the sidewalk . Danny did n't even turn around . Danny 's indifference made Dora hate him even more , which meant that George suffered more because , loving Danny and feelingresponsible for Dora , George was caught in the middle . Danny did n't give a damn if he saw George talking to Dora . But if Dora saw George with Danny , she screamed bloody murder . George 177worried about it for a while , then decided maybe he could solve the problem by getting Danny to be nice to Dora . The suggestion seemed to annoy Danny . " What the hell do I want to be nice to her for ? " he said . " It might help , " George said . " Help what ? " " The way she feels about you . " " Listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her a cripple . " " That 's crazy . I was the one sent her up that lumber stack . I 've explained that to her . " " Yeah ? " Danny said . " How much good did it do ? " " Well  --  " " Well my ass . What she believes she believes . I could be nice to her from now to Yom Kippur and it would n't make any difference . Somebody wants to believe something , they believe it . You try to stop them , you 're just wasting your time . She makes a pain in the neck out of herself , why do n't you just tell her to drop dead ? " It would have made things a lot simpler , of course . But George could n't do it . Ever since he had come home from Albany , Dora had made it plain that she regarded him as her protector . It was a role George did not mind or even see how he could avoid filling . There was something about the slender girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the way she held her body , as though shielding her damaged left arm from the eyes of the world , that gave George a feeling of discomfort . He had done this to her . He was responsible for what she had become . He could n't tell her to drop dead . " Dora 's okay , " he said . " Okay for what ? " Danny said . The tone of his voice made George angry . " God damn it , " he said . " It 's not so long ago , when you were cooking up one of your deals , you were damn glad to have Dora come along and help . Even on Armistice Day , she was good enough for a lookout . " " Was is right , " Danny said coolly . " But she ai n't good enough any more . Now she 's just another tomato with a gimpy arm and a big trap . You want to waste your time listening to her bellyache , go ahead . Me , I have n't got any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . George seldom saw Danny any more except in school . Prohibition had changed the nature of 178 Mike Gerrity 's business , and while George was n't too sure about the exact details of the change , he did know that it kept Danny hopping . Danny never hung around the school yard after classes any more to play basketball or cook up one of his deals . Every day , as soon as the three o'clock bell rang , Danny beat it back to the 111 saloon . All his afternoons as well as his Saturdays and Sundays were spent carrying small packages wrapped in brown paper down to the barges moored at the dock or uptown to destinations , according to people who claimed to have seen Danny with their own eyes , as far west as First Avenue . Dora said he was carrying booze for Mike Gerrity , and one of these days the cops would nab him , and that would be the end of Mr. Danny Schorr , the dirty little shkutz lover . Aunt Tessie agreed . " Only one thing worries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a prison strong enough to hold the little momser , where ? " Aunt Tessie added one of the few smiles she ever allowed to escape beyond range of her beloved George . As soon as she 'd learned how Dora 's feelings for Danny had changed , Aunt Tessie had becomevery fond of the girl from the doll store across the stoop . " They wo n't need such a strong prison , " Dora said contemptuously . " Mr. Danny Schorr is not as tough as he thinks . It 's just he 's got all those shkutzim behind him , that 's why he thinks he 's so great . You wait , though . You just wait . The minute the cops grab him , all the shkutzim in the world wo n't be able to help him . It 'll be the end . " The end , however , seemed to take its own sweet time about arriving . It had certainly not arrived on the day during George 's last year in high school when Danny 's life took the abrupt and surprisingturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor George who loved him , had anticipated . It was the day after Fott Fromkin broke the centigrade thermometerin Mr. Gaspari 's chemistry class . Fott 's real name was Melvin , but all his classmates , among whom were numbered friends as well as enemies , called him Fott because the only other human being named Melvin about whom they had previously heard was Melvin Ott , the Giants ' centerfielder , and since it was perfectly obvious that you could n't nicknamea guy Ott , the next step was even more obvious : Melvin became Fott. 179 lIt did not improve his personality . Franklin Pierce High School on Thirteenth Street was proud of its scholastic standards , which were high , and its democratic tradition , which was highly advertised . It was one of the oldest high schools in the city . Having opened its doors before the turn of the century , at a time when boys seeking a free secondary school educationwere limited in the number of places they could choose from , Franklin Pierce High attracted at once not only very bright but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the sons of parents who , even though they could pay tuition at a private school , believed it would have a salutary effect on their offspring to rub elbows several hours a day for four years with boys whose share of worldly goods was somewhat smaller than theirs . George Hurst had never seen any statistics that might have proved or disproved the truth of this theory . By the time he was old enough to go to high school , only boys whose share of worldly goods was at least respectable had any choice about where they would obtain their secondary school education . Boys like George went where the Board of Education sent them . He considered himself lucky to be sent to Franklin Pierce . So did Aunt Tessie and Uncle Zisha . A boy who graduated from Franklin Pierce with respectable marks would probably have no trouble with college and had a good chance to get into a decent law school , and any boy who was going to become another Brandeis had better get into a decent law school . Fott Fromkin felt differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose father was a wealthy stockbroker , lived on Central Park West in something he called a duplex . George did not know what a duplex was , and he was too ashamed of his ignorance to ask , but he did know , because Fott never grew tired of telling everybody , that the elder Mr. Fromkin 's son and heir was interested in only two subjects : jazz and nookic . Neither of these could , of course , be explored with any degree of thoroughness in an all-male high school the faculty of which was dedicated to maintaining a scholastic standard that was , or at least was reputed to be , the highest in the city . But Fott tried . When he was n't complaining bitterly about his lousy son of a bitch of a father , who should have sent him to Phillips Exeter or Andover , the way the fathers of all his friends on Central Park 18o West had sent their sons , Fott was telling dirty stories or humming something hot by Duke Ellington . Since he was a fat boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost no memory , he did neither of these things well . Duke Ellington , however , is impervious to anything save deliberate sabotage , and dirty stories have been sure-fire for quite some time . Fott , therefore , never lacked for an audience . IIe had one the day Mr. Gaspari was setting up the nitrous oxide experiment at the front of the lab . The lab was a large room on the top floor with twenty-four stone-topped tables arranged in four rows of six each . Four boys worked at each table . Mr. Gaspari worked alone at his table up front until the day 's experiment was ready for demonstration . In theory , while Mr. Gaspari was setting up an experiment , his students were supposed to be studying the relevant material in their textbooks . In practice , a great many other things went on , all the way from surreptitious games of stud poker to gaping at the **28;440;TOOLONG in Fott Fromkin 's stories . " After she finishes taking out her glass eye and unhooking her false arm , this dame happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ berth across the aisle of the train , " Fott was saying in a low voice . " So she grabs the blankets and pulls them up to her chin and she says to the guy across the other side of the train , she snaps at him , real sore , What do you want ? ' The guy , he grins and says , You know what I want ; hand it over ! ' " Fott waited for his laugh , and it came . Perhaps it was n't as loud as he expected . Or perhaps he was seized unexpectedly by an impulse to widen his horizons . Whatever the reason , this much was certain because George saw it happen : Fott put his finger to his lips , tiptoed down the side of the lab , sidled up to Mr. Gaspari 's table and , as the chemistry teacher turned away to pick up a pair of test tube clamps , Fott snatched the centigrade thermometer . Grinning happily , every pimple alight with the easily aroused pleasure of the simple-minded , lie started back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were a flagpole . It almost could have been . It was eighteen inches long and as thick as a broomstick . These dimensions , plus the fact that halfway up the aisle he passed a boy who was bent over his textbook in an attitude of deep concentration , proved too much for Fott . Grinning gleefully for his audience , and pointing at the buttocksof his engrossed classmate , Fott Fromkin began to snap the large glass tube in the air in a crude but recognizable imitation of 181 a doctor shaking down a thermometer before inserting it for a reading . The response from his audience was so enthusiastic that Fott , obviously giddy with this unexpected success in a field he had never before explored , began to snap the thermometer in swifter and wider arcs . This proved to be a mistake . On one of its more violent descents , the end of the eighteen-inch glass tube touched the edge of the slate-top lab table on Fott 's left . The contact was almost inaudible . The effect was astonishing . The large room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost total silence , was suddenly alive with a series of startled screams . Astonished , George saw smears of blood begin to appear on the faces of at least three boys near him . Several others were shouting as they probed scalps and other exposed parts of their bodies for what it took George a few moments to realize were possible wounds caused by bits of flying thermometer . And Mr. Gaspari , a mild little man with thick eyeglasses who always moved with painstaking slowness , was coming up the aisle on the double . In the center of all this excitement , like the motionless hub of a rapidly spinning wheel , stood Fott , his fat , stupid face set in a look of dazed incredulity , as he stared at the six inches of shattered thermometer that still remained in his hand . He looked somewhat like a clown who , fighting what he thought was a mock duel which he was under the impression he was winning , suddenly wakes up to the fact that he is actually fighting for his life and his sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's sake , Melvin ! " Mr. Gaspari said . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ? " " I  --  I  --  I  --  " Fott gasped . Mr. Gaspari pulled himself together . , A rapid survey of the damage caused by Fott 's initial effort in the field of pantomime was reassuring . The cuts suffered by his classmates were minor . The thermometer , however , was quite clearly beyond repair . Mr. Gasparimay not have known what went on behind his back while he was setting up an experiment , but he knew that willful destruction of Board of Education property could not be treated lightly . " Melvin , " he said , " I want to talk to your father . You will bring him to school tomorrow . Is that clear ? " Fott nodded dumbly . The next day , when the chemistry class assembled in Mr. Gaspari 's lab , George watched eagerly , along with the rest of the class , for Fott 's father to show up . He never did . " Melvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr.182Gaspari said severely when Fott came in alone . " Where is he ? " Fott sent a quick glance across his shoulder to make sure everybody was listening . He wore the look of moronic pleasure that always appeared on his fat face when he was about to deliver the punch line of one of his dirty jokes . " In Campbell 's Funeral Parlor over on Madison Avenue , " he said in a loud , clear voice . " My father shot himself in his office down on Wall Street at five o'clock last night ! " Mr. Gaspari was stunned , but all George could think about was what Danny and Dora would say when he brought the thrilling news borne to Fourth Street . Ile did n't often have tidbits as good as a suicide with which to lace together the gap that had appeared between their lives and his when the three of them graduated from P.S. 188 . It was a gap that had taken George by surprise . He had never paid attention to the belief so widely held on Fourth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in P.S. 188 was that the saloonkeeper knew he would have been in trouble with the city authorities if he 'd taken Danny out of school before he completed the eighth grade , and the one thing a man in Mike Gerrity 's business did not want was trouble with any kind of authorities . George had assumed that Danny liked school . He was astonished when he learned that Danny had no intention of going on from P.S. 188 to Franklin Pierce , but not nearly so astonished as Danny was when he learned about George 's assumption . " High school ? " Danny said as though George had suggested that they try walking on water . " What the hell do I want to go to high school for ? " " If you want to be a lawyer , you have to go to college , " George said . " And if you want to go to college , you have to go to high school first . " " You 're the one wants to he a lawyer , " Danny said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me anything about it from books . " Dora had been equally emphatic . " What are they going to teach me in high school ? " she said to George . " How to straighten out my crooked arm ? " George hated it when she talked about her arm . " You could learn bookkeeping or stenography , " he said . " You could become a private secretary . " He was quoting Mr. Dunn , the P.S. 188 principal , who had told X83 the members of the graduating class about the advantages to be derived from continuing their education by going on to high school . " Some private secretary , " Dora said bitterly . " With an arm like a corkscrew . You go to high school . You 're going to be another Judge Brandeis . Me , I 'll go help Frannie and Ida stick hair on Papa 's dolls . " At first it used to make George feel uncomfortable to see her , when he came home from school , sitting beside her sisters in the store across the stoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads and combing the tight little curls down into neat little wigs . It did n't seem right that he should spend his days with books and the simple odd jobs involved in helping Aunt Tessie , while this slender girl spent hers in a factory . Oddly enough , however , Dora did n't seem to mind . She did n't seem to mind anything , including the constant criticism of Frannie and Ida , who said her work was so sloppy that everything she did had to be done over again by them . It was as though the odd way she had of holding her body , with the shoulders hunched forward to shield her crooked arm , shielded her also from what went on around her . She liked to have George stop in after school , or when he finished delivering a pressed dress or suit for Aunt Tessic , and tell her what had happened to him during the day . He enjoyed doing it , because he always enjoyed being near her , but even though she listened with apparent interest , George had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . It was as though she had built an invisible wall around herself and , while it was important to her that the wall should be neither scaled nor breached , it was equally important to her to pretend that the wall did not exist . Several times , when his account of something that had happened in school struck her for some reason as particularly interesting , Dora seemed to come out from behind the wall , her eyes flashing and her voice rising with quick interest , the way they used to before the Armistice Day accident in the Forest . These moments were for George so pleasant that he tried to repeat them as often as he could . This was not easy , because he never really knew what it was in each instance that had appealed to Dora strongly enough to cut through her lethargy . The day that Fott Fromkin 's father committed suicide , however , George had no such doubts . He knew he was bringing home X84a story that would top anything Dora had ever heard before . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coming around the corner from Avenue D into Fourth Street , he saw Danny Schorr moving up the street toward him . This was an unexpected break . As a rule , he did n't get a chance to see Danny until after supper , when George had finished his homework and Danny had finished all his errands for Mike Gerrity . This way he would be able to tell Danny about Fott Fromkin 's father before he told Dora . George quickened his pace . So did Danny . They met in front of the open lot next to Forman 's grocery . " Boy , " George said , " have I got something to tell you ! " " Later , " Danny said . " C'mere a minute . " He took George by the arm and pulled him into the empty lot . It was used by the O'Brien Coal Company as a parking area for wagons . From the way Danny moved him around one of the wagons , so that they were partially concealed from the street , it suddenly occurred to George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You been waiting for me ? " George said . Danny nodded . " I need some help . " " Anything , Danny . " " You mean that ? " " Cut it out , " George said . " You know I mean it . " Danny nodded again . " I was just kidding , " he said . " Sure I know it . " " Then tell me what you want . " " I want to move in with you . " " In with me ? You mean to live ? " " That 's right . " " With me and Aunt Tessie ? " " What are you screaming about ? " " I 'm not screaming . I 'm just  --  " " Just what ? " George gave himself a moment . It did n't help . The whole thing still seemed crazy . " I do n't know , " he said finally . " I do n't understand what  --  ? " " Mike Gerrity was shot and killed last night some place up-town . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yes or no . Which is it ? " " It 's not up to me , Danny . " X85 l " You can make her do anything you want . " " Are you kidding ? " " I need a place to Iive . I 'm not kidding . " " We only got the two small rooms . " " I could sleep in the store . " " She hates you , Danny . " " You can make her do anything you want . " " Danny , nobody makes Aunt Tessie do anything she does n't want . " " You just said you were my friend . " " Sure I am . But what you 're asking  --  " " If you were n't my friend , I would n't be asking . " George stood there , wanting desperately to prove his friendship , and feeling helpless because he knew it was impossible to give Danny the proof he wanted . " I 'll tell you what , " he said at last . " You 'll fix it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was so smart about everything else , was apparently not smart enough to grasp the simple fact that nobody fixed things up with Aunt Tessie . " Let 's go talk to her , " George said . He tried to sound confident even though he knew it was hopeless , which only made him feel worse because trying to sound confidentwas in this case no better than lying , and he had never before lied to Danny . Just the same , George did n't see what else he could do . He could n't let Danny think he was n't even trying . " So now , instead of carrying it out of the house , " Aunt Tessie said coldly to George when he opened the front door and came in with Danny , " you 're bringing garbage in ? " She was sitting in her rocking chair in the window , pulling the basting out of a yellow skirt . " Do n't get sore until you hear what it 's all about , " George said . " I 'm not getting sore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing precisely that . " And your shkutz-loving friend , he 's getting out . " She stepped around Danny as though he were something one of the O'Brien Coal Company horses had just dropped in her path , and she started for the back of the store . " Wait . " She stopped and turned , obviously surprised . So was George . He had never heard Danny sound like that . " I know what you think of me , " he said , talking to Aunt Tessie , 186 but keeping his eyes fixed on the floor . " I 'm not saying I blame you . But I did n't come here to argue about that . What I came here for , I 'm in trouble , and I need help , and I came to my best friend to get it . Look at it this way . If your own George feels about me the way he does , maybe I 'm not as bad as you figure me to be . " The expression on Aunt Tessie 's face did not change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes that a completely new thought had been planted in her mind . " What kind of trouble ? " She sounded exactly as she had sounded a few moments earlier , when she had ordered Danny out of the store , but the mere fact that she had asked the question was astonishing . To George , at any rate . Danny did n't seem to find it astonishing . Danny continued to scowl down at his hands as , in a low voice , he told Aunt Tessie the nature of his trouble . " Nobody told you to go live with shkutzim , " Aunt Tessie said when he finished . " You went yourself . Because you liked it . If you like it , they must be your friends . So now , because one of them gets killed , all of a sudden they 're not your friends ? What kind of friends is this ? " " Mike  --  Mr. Gerrity , he was my friend , " Danny said quietly . " The rest of them , they never liked me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they  --  " He paused , and he drew a deep breath , as though he needed all the strength he could muster for what he had to say next . " They kicked me out , " Danny Schorr said . It was like hearing Mr. Gaspari admit publicly that he did n't know how to set up an experiment in the chemistry lab . Even Aunt Tessie , who did n't know Mr. Gaspari , knew what it must have cost Danny to make this confession . George could see the muscles in her jaw ripple . For several moments the silence in the store was almost physically painful . Danny broke it . " If I do n't get a place to sleep , " he said . " If the cops or somebody else , they come after me and I ca n't say where I live  --  " He paused , and he shrugged . The gesture of helplessness was even more shocking than the admission that the Gerritys had thrown him out . " They 'll send me to Henry Isaacs , " Danny Schorr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his head . The brown , restless eyes looked directly into Aunt Tessie 's . All at once George could hear his own heartbeats and the alarm clock ticking out in the kitchen . They seemed to be X87 lracing one another . George held his breath . Something extraordinary was happening . He did n't know what it was , but he knew it had something to do with that feeling Danny brought into a room , the feeling that reminded George of a carpet tack being drawn toward a magnet . Aunt Tessie cleared her throat . " If I give you a place to live , " she said , " you 'll give me something back ? " " Anything you want , " Danny said . " I want from you a promise , " Aunt Tessie said . " You 'll never , never , never again , as long as you live , you 'll never go again live with shkutzim . " " I promise , " Danny said . Aunt Tessie turned to George . " Go get blankets , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back of the store . " 10Danny slept in it for three weeks . It took the surviving members of the Gerrity family that long to realize they could n't get along without him . As soon as they did , Mike Gerrity , Jr. , who had lost an arm in the war , walked across the street to see Danny . He walked across the street , but he did n't come into Aunt Tessie 's store . Even Mike Gerrity , Jr. , who according to Danny was a dumb ox , had enough brains not to do that . The incident took place shortly before noon , so that George , who was in school , did not see it . Dora Dienst saw it , however . This was fortunate , because Aunt Tessie , who had also seen it , refused to discuss the matter , and George wanted very much to know what had happened . Dora told him . " I was sitting here , working , when all of a sudden I saw the side door , there  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It opened , and instead of some drunken shkutz , out comes the big war hero , so right away I knew something was wrong . " George could understand that . Like the other members of his family , Mike Gerrity , Jr. , rarely came out into the open . It was 188 generally believed on Fourth Street that this was due to the fact that he was rarely sober enough to walk . " He was n't exactly drunk , but he was n't not drunk , either , " Dora said . " He walked crooked coming across the gutter , so I got up and went over to the window for a better look , and I saw he 'd stopped in front of your Aunt Tcssic 's store , and he was calling Danny 's name . He called a long time , and after a while Danny came out and asked what he wanted . Mother and I want you to come back , he said . Is n't that nice , Danny said , and he spit across the big war hero 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your mother can do , Danny said , and he turned to go back in , but Mike grabbed Danny with his one hand and he said listen . Danny shook the hand off and you know the way he gets when he 's mad ? His face tight and his lips thin and his voice like it was hurting his throat to get the words out ? " George nodded . He knew . " Danny said you put your hand on Inc again , you dirty rotten drunk , and I 'll beat your brains out , you got one arm or not , you hear ? The big war hero heard all right , " Dora said . " But he did n't do anything about it . He just said lie was sorry and he stood there , holding himself up by the garbage can , and first I thought what 's Danny doing standing there ? The way he talked , calling names and all , and telling Mike and his mother to drop dead , why did n't he turn around and beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " George said . Dora smiled contemptuously . " Because he did n't want to go in , " she said . " All that talk , drop dead , go to hell , you put your hand on me again I 'll beat your brains out , all that , it was just talk . What Danny wanted , the dirty little slikutz lover , he wanted the big war hero to come crawling , that 's what . So he could bargain with him . " " Bargain about what ? " George said . " Danny said okay , I 'll come back , but first we get a few things straight . Mike said sure , anything , like Danny had given him a great big present , and then Danny told him . He said from now on he wanted Mike 's room up on the second floor , not the old room he used to have , and he wanted the couch moved into his room from the parlor on the first floor , and he wanted nobody interfering with what he did , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the way Mike 's father taught him , or he was n't going to run it at all . The way he sounded when he was saying it , honest , even though 189 lhe was talking to a shkutz , it made my blood boil just to hear him . Anybody else , they would have spit in his eye and told him to go to hell , but the big war hero , that drunken shkutz , he was so glad the great Danny Schorr was coming back , he almost got down on the sidewalk and kissed his shoes . Honest to God , " Dora said bitterly , " I wanted to vomit . " " That 's all ? " George said . " It 's not enough ? He walked back across the street with the big war hero so fast , he did n't even have time to say good-bye to your Aunt Tessie . " George did n't believe this . He attributed the statement to Dora 's hatred of Danny and to the fact that , when she 'd learned Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for almost a week she had refused to speak to George or Aunt Tessie . When George learned that Dora had told the truth , he was upset enough to wait out in front of the store for almost two hours , until he finally saw Danny coming down the street . George went to meet him . " I know , I know , I know , " Danny said , holding up his hand like a traffic cop . " You went to all that trouble , you got your Aunt Tessie to take me in , and now I  --  " " You 're wrong , " George said . " I did n't get Aunt Tessic to take you in . She did it herself . " Danny looked puzzled . " What 's the diff ? " he said . " You do n't owe me explanations or thanks or anything else , because I 'm your friend , " George said . " But Aunt Tessie , she 's not your friend . " Danny scowled and slowly scratched the side of his jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get something straight in his mind . " What the hell  --  ? " he began slowly , and then he paused to think some more . Suddenly he snapped his fingers and grinned . " You mean it 'll make you feel better if I go to see her ? " " That 's right , " George said . " Then what are we waiting for ? " Danny said . He took George by the arm . " Let 's go . " Aunt Tessie was working in the rocking chair in the window when they came in . She looked up once , then dropped her eyes back to her work . " I guess I left kind of in a hurry , " Danny said . " I did n't get a chance to say good-bye . " 190 l " Good-bye , " Aunt Tessie said without looking up . Danny smiled . He was making a special effort , George could see , to be nice . " I appreciate what you did for me , " Danny said . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes fixed on the seam she was sewing . Danny 's smile grew a little wider . He was really turning on the charm . " I want to thank you for  --  " " There 's nothing to thank me . " " I was in trouble , " Danny said . " I needed help . You took me in here and  --  " " I did n't do it because you were in trouble , " Aunt Tessie said . " I did n't do it because you needed help . " She looked up from her work . " I did it because I thought there was a chance to save a Jewish soul . I was wrong . " She pushed herself up out of the rocking chair . Her small , dark face was set . " Nobody can save you . " She sounded like a judge pronouncing sentence . ' There 's nothing left to save , " Aunt Tessie said . " Only by the shkutzim you 're still a living person . By me , you 're already dead . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his mouth to say something , then changed his mind . Ile turned on his heel and walked out of the store , slamming the door behind him . He never mentioned the incident . Neither did Aunt Tessie . This made things a lot simpler for George . It was as though , now that she considered Danny to be dead , Aunt Tessie no longer considered George 's friendship for him to be a troubling matter . How could a dead person do you any harm ? George could think of a number of answers to that , but he did not make them to Aunt Tessie . He was content to let well enough alone . This involved no more than acceptingAunt Tessie 's pretense that Danny Schorr no longer existed . She never mentioned his name . Not even on the day after George graduated from Franklin Pierce Iligh School and he told Aunt Tessie he was going downtown to hunt for a job with Danny Schorr . " Be careful when you cross the gutters , " she said . " Look both ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George realized much later , may not have been due entirely to Aunt Tessie 's scrupulous refusal to utter Danny Schorr 's name . It may have been due also to her embarrassment over the fact that George had to go out and look for a job . Ever since his visit to Albany , when he was still in Miss Cor- 191 lcoran 's class in P.S. 188 , it had been taken for granted in the Hurst household that , when George graduated from Franklin Pierce , he would be sent first to college and then to law school by Uncle Zisha . For years every letter from Albany had contained some reference to this long-range plan . In the middle of George 's last year at Franklin Pierce , however , these references became less frequent and finally stopped . For some reason that all his courses in economics never made quite clear to George , the bottom had fallen out of Uncle Zisha 's soda-bottling business in Albany . Root beer and cream soda , it seemed , were a luxury that , as the nation 's prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do without Uncle Zisha 's brand , at any rate . For months before George 's graduation there had been hints of trouble . Aunt Tessie 's reactions to them were mixed . She did not like the news that , because business had fallen off so badly , Uncle Zisha had been forced to fire several drivers and had taken on some of the delivery work himself . " IIe 's too fat and too old to shlep around those big cases full of bottles , " she said with a worried scowl . " He 's been living too good for too many years to all of a sudden stop eating and start working . " The news that Uncle Zisha had been forced to let Mrs. Gerstenbergergo , however , caused Aunt Tessie to nod with satisfaction . " The house , if he has to clean for himself , in no time it 'll look like pigs were living in it . But if he has to cook for himself , he wo n't eat so much . " Aunt Tessie gave George a short glance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's not married to , this it 'll never hurt him with God , believe me ! " What did hurt , if not with God then at least with Aunt Tessie , was the realization , as George 's graduation from Franklin Pierce drew near , that , if he was going to become another Judge Brandeis , his college and law school tuition would have to be paid not by Uncle Zisha but by George himself . This did not bother him . All the boys and girls on Fourth Street , from Dora Dienst who had gone into her father 's doll factory at thirteen to Doodoo Kashkewitz who started shoeing horses in the blacksmith shop across the street when George started intermediate algebra at Franklin Pierce , were expected to make some contribution to the income of their families , as soon as they were old enough to get their working papers . What did bother George was the fact that Danny Schorr had to go out and look for work , too . Even though George was not altogether sure about the nature 192 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else on Fourth Street , he assumed involved some form of bootlegging , he had been quite sure , again like everybody else on Fourth Street , that it was prosperous . George had assunicd further that Danny , who had gone back to live in the saloon under his own stiff terms , was getting his share of this prosperity . Nevertheless , a couple of weeks before George graduated from Franklin Pierce , Danny told him one day through a troubled frown that , unless he wanted to break himself of the habit of eating regularly , he guessed he 'd better go out and get himself a job pretty soon . " Last week we took in eight bucks , " Danny said . " Uncle Zisba 's got his troubles up in Albany , too , " George said . " He 's up in Albany , " Danny said . " I 'm down here . " " What kind of job you going to look for ? " " Christ knows . " " I 've got to get me a job right after graduation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " George said . " I 've been reading the papers every day . " " You see anything good , " Danny said , " let me know . " What George saw every day for almost two weeks , in the middle of the New York World want-ad section , was a square block of type several times larger than any of the surrounding advertisements : WANTED ! WANTED ! WANTED ! Young Men 17-20Office WorkGood PayNo Experience NecessaryOpportunities For AdvancementApply in Person OnlyALLIED EMPLOYMENT AGENCY20 CIIURCII STREETGeorge showed the advertisement to Danny , who agreed that it looked like a good bet . The morning after George 's graduation , they took the Avenue B trolley down to Park Row and walked across to Church Street . There was a sign on the door of the Allied Employ- ment Agency that said , " We open at 9:00 A.M. " The only reason George and Danny , who arrived at eight-fifteen , knew what was printed on the sign was that George , who was a head taller than Danny , was several inches taller than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . There were at least two hundred of them . They could n't seem to stand still . They prowled around in small circles , eying one another suspiciously , not exactly shoving but constantlypressing forward , maneuvering with shoulders and elbows , jockeying for positions closest to the door . When the door finally opened , they poured in like coal rattling down a chute . What they poured into was a large , square , unadorned room that , for some reason , reminded George of pictures he had seen of Spanish bull rings . It was divided in half by a wooden rail behind which , at identical desks , sat half a dozen young men who could have been clothing dummies plucked from the window of Metzger 's Men 's Shop on Avenue B. Their suits did n't seem to have any creases at the elbows , and their faces were as smooth as the outside of a honeydew melon , and they sat bent over their desks , never raising their heads to glance toward the mob at the other side of the rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those sitting positions by a window dresser . George found them a little disturbing . He felt he had seen them before , and even though he knew this was impossible , he could n't shake off the additional feeling that he had been tipped off by somebody to watch out for these men . Four other young men , who looked exactly like the first six except for the fact that these four were in motion , faced the crowd of boys from behind the rail and shoved white cards into their clutching hands . " Fill in all questions , return the cards , and wait until your name is called , " these four young men chanted in a monotonous singsong that apparently involved only their vocal cords and their lips . The upper parts of their faces did n't move . " Fill in all questions , return the cards , and wait until your name is called . " As the filled-in cards were returned to the four young men at the rail , they passed them in small batches to the six clothing dummiesat the desks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed them back one at a time to the four young men at the rail . As the young men at the rail called out the names , the boys came up out of the crowd . Nobody came up slowly and nobody came up looking as unworried as he was obviously trying to look . Standing at one side with Danny after they had turned in their cards , George saw that one of two things happened next . The boy whose name was called was either given his card and allowed to passQ 194 lwith it through a gate in the wooden rail to take a seat beside one of the six desks , in which case he began to look even more worried , or , after listening to something one of the four young men at the rail said , the boy turned without his card and walked out , looking a little sick . " What goes on ? " George whispered . " As soon as I find out , " Danny said , " I 'll send you a telegram . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth nibbling slowly at the corner of his lower lip , that George knew as well as he knew his own address . Danny was casing the situation . " Schorr ? " the voice at the rail sang out . " Daniel Schorr ? " " If I come back rich , " Danny said out of the corner of his mouth , " I 'll buy you an Eskimo Pie . " He came back sooner than he expected , without his card , but George did n't get a chance to ask what had happened because just then his own name was called . Before he could do too much about trying to arrange his face in an unworried look , George was at the rail , facing the young man who had called his name . " Sorry , " the young man said . " We 're all full up . " He dropped George 's card into a wastebasket , looked at another card and , across George 's head , sang out , " Anderson ? Eugene Anderson ? " The pain did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , and then his first instinct was to find Danny . Looking around quickly , what George saw instead were a half dozen faces that , as the pain increased but the shock began to wear off , George realized looked a lot the way he was sure his own face looked at the moment . " Son of a bitches ! " George turned . A boy with red hair was moving past him , on the way to the street door , with a boy in a brown suit . " They do n't want Jews , why the hell do n't they say so in the ad ? " the boy with red hair said sullenly . " Make a guy spend carfare coming all the way downtown for nothing , the bastards . " George stood there , paying no attention to the boys jostling him on either side , staring at the receding red-headed figure , beginingto grasp the meaning of what had happened , and feeling like a bottle filling slowly with something unfamiliar and dangerous . Things he had n't thought about for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , shooting off blinding sparks that held him as though in a trance : phrases Uncle Zisha had used about Judge Brandeis and the Land of Opportunity ; Aunt Tessie 's warn- ' 95 lings about shkutzim . All at once George understood why , as soon as he 'd seen the clothing dummies behind the desks inside the agency , he 'd had the feeling they were familiar . They wore different clothes , and they were not driving O'Brien coal wagons or loading Forrester lumber barges , but they looked exactly like the shkutzim who hung around Gerrity 's saloon . The red-headed figure at the end of the corridor disappeared through the street door . George came out of his trance . Breathing through his mouth , feeling his tongue go dry and sour , he ran down the corridor to the door . He caught up with the red-headed boy on the sidewalk . " What you just said . Why they threw us out . It 's becausewe 're Jews ? " The red-headed boy looked at him in surprise , turned to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George . " Why do you think it 's because ? " he said . " They do n't like the way you part your hair ? " He took his friend 's arm and walked off down the street . George turned , went back into the building , and hurried up the corridor to the Allied Employment Agency door . When he came in , the four young men at the rail were still calling out names . George was aware , as he pushed through the crowd , that boys were staring at him . He paid no attention to them . It was as though he had been entered by forces stronger than himself in a race against time . Ile had to finish what he had been chosen to do before the dangerous feeling flooding up inside him poured over the edge . When he reached the young man who had thrown his card into the wastebasket , George could hear his own breath coming in short , hard gasps . He leaned across the rail , grabbed the wastebasket , pushed the cards around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled it out . George shoved the card under the nose of the young man at the other side of the rail . " Why did you throw this out ? " The young man looked surprised . " We 're full up , " he said . He glanced at the card in his hand and , across George 's head , sang out , " Talmadge ? Edward Talmadge ? " " If you 're full up , " George said , " how come you 're calling Talmadge ? " " Step away from the rail , please . " " If you 're full up , " George said again , " how come you 're calling Talmadge ? " " Get out of here before I have you thrown out . " 196 " Why do n't you answer my question ? If you 're full up , how come you 're calling Talmadge ? " The face that up to now had been as smooth as the outside of a honeydew melon was suddenly a mass of small , angry creases . " Listen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell out of here before  --  " That was as far as he got . George 's fist , digging deep into the belly at the other side of the wooden gate , smoothed away all the angry creases . The suddenly pop-eyed face came all the way forward , as though its owner were a pocketknife with an open blade that had suddenly started to snap shut . Any further attempt at completing the threat , even if the speaker had possessed the wind with which to make it , was eliminated by the inverted wastebasket . Showering cards like gigantic snowflakes , George brought the basket down with a hard thump as though the head in front of him were a fountain pen and he was ramming home the cap . This hastily executed series of movements , each one separate , distinct , and clear in George 's mind , was followed by a period of confusion during which he was aware of hands pulling at him and voices shouting around him , but George could n't seem to bring them into focus . He did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole inside himself , and the dangerous flood that had brought him to the level of violence was casing away . He allowed himself to be carried along until suddenly he realized the voices were all gone . All , that is , except one . " Jesus , " Danny Schorr was saying . " What the hella you think you 're doing ? " George blinked at him and then looked around . He was out in what seemed to be a deserted alley , and Danny was holding him upright against a brick wall . George was grateful for the support . His knees felt weak . " I  --  I  --  " George closed his eyes and shook his head . " I guess I flew off the handle . " " Boy , " Danny said . " You took the handle with you . " George opened his eyes . Danny was looking at him curiously . George felt he 'd better explain . " First , I did n't know what happened . Then , when I  --  " He paused and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You know why they told us they were full up ? " " Sure . " 197 lGeorge blinked again . " You knew it when we came down here ? " " What kind of a shvantz do you think I am ? " Danny said . " If I knew it when we came down here , would I come to begin with ? When we came down here all I knew was I wanted a job . When I found out they were n't giving any to heebs , I look around for you , and what do I find ? You 're starting a God-damn riot . " Danny released George and bent down to slap dust from his pants . " If I had n't hustled you the hell out of there , you know where you 'd be now ? In the clink , boy . Those bastards do n't fool around . They sent for the cops . " George saw that something was wrong . Danny , who was usually so quick at sizing things up , seemed to have muffed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said impatiently . " I 'm talking about  --  " Danny stopped dusting his knees . " If you have to be dumb , " he said , " try not to be that dumb . People who forget about cops end up in places where the cops can forget about them . " " That 's not what I mean , " George said . " I mean those bastards in there , throwing guys out just because we 're Jews , they have no right  --  " " What the hell has right got to do with it ? " George looked at Danny in astonishment . " You mean you 're not sore ? " " Sure I 'm sore , " Danny said irritably . " If I 'd known they did n't take Jews , I 'd 've been prepared to handle it . This way , not prepared , coming down here , the whole thing was just a great big God-damn waste of time . " " That 's all you 're sore about ? That they wasted your time ? " Danny 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of his lower lip . He stared at George for several moments . Then his face cleared , the way it always did when he had something figured out , and Danny grinned . " Georgie , boy , " he said . " What else do you want me to be sore about ? " Again , in his mind , George ran through some of those things Uncle Zisha had said years ago about Judge Brandeis and the Land of Opportunity . Only a little while ago , in the corridor of the Allied Employment Agency , there had been enough power in those rememberedphrases to make George haul off and belt a total stranger . Now , in the light of Danny 's grin , the phrases suddenly seemed embarrassing. 198 " I do n't want you to be sore about anything , " George said uncomfortably . " It 's just that , I do n't know , getting roosted out on my tail like that , just because I 'm a Jew , it burned me up . " " What 's that got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny said . George did n't answer . " Every place you go there 's bastards they do n't like hecbs . Most of them , they can drop dead . Who needs them ? But the other ones , the guys they got the jobs to hand out , you go around letting these stupid jerks burn you up just because they do n't like the shape of your beak , where the hell you going to get the dough to pay for your Oh Henrys ? " George did n't know how to answer that . Any more than the people of Fourth Street who had tried to get Danny 's father to stop Danny from running errands for Mike Gerrity had known how to answer Mr. Schorr when the house painter asked them if they planned to make him another Rockefeller . The grin slid away from Danny 's face . " You got to keep your eye on the ball , " he said . " Belting guys because they do n't like Jews , that 's okay if you want to be a hero . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind what you want . " Danny paused , and the bright , restless brown eyes seemed to grow a little brighter . " What do you want , kid ? " he said quietly . " You want a job ? Or you want to be a hero ? " What George wanted all of a sudden was a hole to crawl into . He dropped his glance . Ile was ashamed of what he had just done in the Allied Employment Agency . Ile felt grateful to Danny for straightening him out . He wondered why anybody as smart as Danny Schorr bothered to be friends with somebody as dumb as George Hurst . " Sure I want a job , " he muttered . " But  --  " " When you want a job , it 's the guy who 's got the job to give that calls the buts . " Danny grinned and poked George gently with his fist . " Come on , Dempsey , " he said . " Let 's get going . " " Where to ? " George said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny said. 11The fact that the place proved to be the home office of L. L. Parker Stores , Inc. , did not strike George as amazing until months later , when he came to know something about the origin of the policies by which the large organization was run . On the day when he and Danny Schorr were turned away by the Allied Employment Agency , George had never even heard of L. L. Parker Stores , Inc . This was not surprising . The L. L. Parker Stores , which were spread across the face of America like acne , functioned most successfully in towns with a population under 5,000 . There were those who attributed this success to a belief that the incidence of gullibility varies in direct proportion to the size of a community . Or , as an embittered rival once put it : " Big town , small boobs ; small town , big boobs . " Ludwig Leo Pauker , the once penniless German immigrant who founded the company , explained it somewhat differently at the eightieth birthday dinner given in his honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into the highly prosperous business . " Soon after I came to this country I learned an important lesson , " the old man said , according to a stenographic record of his speech that was circulated surreptitiously for years by disgruntled employees . " You buy something for one dollar , you sell it for two dollars , maybe you make a profit and maybe you do n't . Depends on how much of that second dollar you have to pay out for overhead . But you buy something for one dollar and you sell it for twenty dollars , and even a lousy businessman can make a profit , regardless of overhead . There are only two problems : where do you find damn fools willing to pay twenty dollars for something that cost you only one dollar , and how do you get them to pay it ? " The answer to the first question proved to be : stick to communitiestoo small to support many stores , thus narrowing the purchaser'srange of choice . The answer to the second question was even simpler : make the purchaser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that cost you only one . " A girl sees a hat in a window and she wants it , " continued the stenographic transcript of the multimillionaire octagenarian 's birthday 200 lremarks . " The hat has a price tag on it that says twenty dollars , but the girl has in her pocket only three dollars . You say to the girl : forget the twenty-dollar price tag ; give me the three dollars and you take the hat . Her eyes get big as pickle barrels and she says : you mean it ? To prove you mean it , you take the hat out of the window , and you give it to her , and she gives you her three dollars . While she 's trying the hat on , you say : the other seventeen dollars you can forget ; just remember only one thing : for the next seventeen weeks , every payclay , you come in and give me another dollar . That 's all . Just one dollar every payday . That 's not a lot , is it ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in the meantime , you 've got this beautiful hat to wear ! The girl is n't even listening . She 's trying on the hat . And you ? How do you stand ? Well , even if she does n't come in for the full seventeen weeks . Even if she gets tired or she runs out of money or she moves away after only five or six weeks . What then ? Well , before she walked out of the store she already gave you three dollars for a hat that cost you only one dollar . A normal profit of two hundred per cent you already have in your pocket . From then on , every week that girl comes in with her dollar on payday , you are soaking up pure gravy ! " Young Ludwig Leo Pauker 's next discovery was that , in certain parts of his adopted country , his German name was a handicap . A man who has no qualms about charging a shop girl twenty dollars for a hat that cost him one dollar is hardly likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo Pauker became L. L. Parker , and the results were so gratifying that , before Iong , another problem arose , namely , where to find enough one-dollar hats . The answer was the home of the millinery industry : New York . There , in a three-story building on Fifteenth Street near Sixth Avenue , L. L. Parker in 1906 set up the central buying office and bookkeeping department of the national chain bearing his name that then consisted of a mere seventy-six stores . Before too many years had gone by , the process of soaking up pure gravy had swollen the chain to more than eight hundred stores selling jewelry and athletic equipment as well as complete lines of men 's and women 's apparel , and the expanding administrative machineryof the home office had engulfed a dozen of the original threestorybuilding 's neighbors on Fifteenth Street . So many of the founder 's descendants were now taking an active part in the operation 201 lof the huge business , that the old man was free to devote himself exclusively to the formulation of its policies . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an L. L. Parker rule never to bring suit against a defaulting customer unless he ceased making weekly payments before the net profit to the company on his purchase amounted to less than eight hundred per cent . " If you sue too many people the word begins to get around that you are a heartless organization to do business with , people becomefrightened , and they start going to your competitors for their hats and shoes and wrist watches , " said the founder 's memorandum to the staff on this subject . " Besides , eight hundred per cent is not a profit to be ashamed of . " Some of L. L. 's other policies were clearly the result of predilectionsthe old man had brought with him from his native land . Several months before the day when George Ilurst punched the young man in the Allied Employment Agency down on Church Street , old L. L. Parker up on Fifteenth Street had subjected his company 's Employment Application Blank , which had remained unchanged since it was first printed in 1906 , to a single revision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old blank had been sandwiched carelessly between HOBBIES ? and COLOR OF EYES ? near the bottom of the sheet , was moved up to the top , immediately below the applicant 's name , where it appeared in red ink . Staring at the two boldly printed words which stood out from the rest of the page like a neon sign in a dark cellar , George hesitated . All the way uptown from Church Street , listening to Danny 's advice on how to handle the situation , it had seemed sensible and simple . Things always seemed sensible and simple when Danny explained them . Sometimes , though , when you got beyond range of his voice , when you were all alone and the moment came to do what Danny had advised , it seemed not so simple after all . An elbow dug into George 's ribs . He moved his head to the right . Danny , bent over his own applicationblank in the next chair , pointed to the two red words and gave George a quick wink . George shoved the moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carefully , with the fountainpen Uncle Zisha had sent from Albany as a graduation present , George wrote in after the red inked query RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION ? the single word : LUTHERAN. 202 He did it without conviction . There were in the L. L. Parker home office almost a thousand employees . The turnover of help was large and rapid . The staff of the Personnel Office , one man and two women with flat , hard , coldly appraising faces , must have at one time or another run across every trick in the book . In spite of Danny 's assurances , George did n't see how they could be fooled by a dodge as simple as this . Ile was certain it would n't work . Ten minutes later his respect for Danny Schorr , which had always been high , took a marked leap upward . " When can you start work ? " the older of the two women was asking as she looked up from George Hurst 's application blank . " Right away , " he said . " Be here tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news that he had landed a job so quickly . George did not spoil her pleasure by telling her that , in order to get it , he had lied about his religion , or that Danny Schorr had landed a job in the same place . " How much is the pay ? " Aunt Tessie said . " Twelve dollars , " George said . Aunt Tessie 's eyebrows went up . " They 're starting you off in the president 's job ? " " I imagine the president of L. L. Parker Stores gets a little more than twelve bucks a week . " " Bucks you can talk out in the street with your friends . IIere in the house you 'll talk English . What do you have to do for this twelve dollars a week ? " " I do n't know vet . All I know is I 'm in the Mail Department . " " You know something else , " Aunt Tessie said . " Now you know , if you behave yourself and you do n't get into trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go looking for with candles . " " I wo n't get into trouble . " " God should only be listening and believe you . The first day you get paid we 'll open for you a bank account . By the end of the summer , when night school starts , Judge Brandeis should watch out or you 'll have soon his job , too . " " I 've got a long way to go before Judge Brandeis starts worrying . " " The longest way is the shortest way if you do n't stop to look in every store window . " Aunt Tcssie stopped to look around her own store . " Maybe in the back here , by the pressing machine , we could put a desk ? " 203 l " What for ? " " To make potato lottkiss . Listen to a question ! From a boy just graduated from high school yet . What does a person use a desk for , for what ? In high school , to study there on the table in the kitchen , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it 'll be law school . For college and for law school a table in the kitchen , no . We 'll get a desk , and we 'll put it here in the back with a good light , and by the end of the summer , when night school starts , you 'll be ready with a place to study . " It did n't work out that way . Two weeks later , before Aunt Tessie had found a desk that met her ideas of what was appropriate for George , Uncle Zisha collapsed while carrying a case of bottles from his truck into a candy store . The telegram sent by his doctor urged Aunt Tessie to come to Albany at once . " All his life , that brother of mine , everything he always did at the wrong time , " she said angrily as she slapped things into the cardboard suitcase George had used so many years ago on his own visit to Albany . " A grown-up man , nearly sixty years old already , he 's still doing it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the middle of the summer ? It 's hot ? You just got a job ? I 'm busy with looking for a desk ? " " Uncle Zisha ca n't help the time when he gets sick , " George said . " I 'm sure he did n't plan it this way . " " Who planned it , then ? " Aunt Tessie snapped . " Mc ? Yon ? The President ? It 's somebody else 's fault , maybe , that for forty years he 's been eating like a pig with eight eyes and four stomachs ? Who 's there to blame if a whole night long , when other people they 're sleeping , he 's running around with God knows who , drinking and worse yet than drinking ? From this he expects to be healthy ? Becauseof his eating and drinking and running around , I have to go shlep myself to Albany in the middle of the summer ? " George , who was accustomed to her sharp tongue , was disturbed by the way Aunt Tessie sounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as though a beautifully honed knife was being used clumsily as an axe . " You want me to go instead ? " George said . " And lose the job you just got ? What kind of brains is that ? " " We work only half a day on Saturday . I could get a train in the afternoon and be up there that night , and then come back Sunday . " 204 Aunt Tessie hesitated . Watching her face , from which the anger had peeled away while she considered George 's suggestion , he suddenly understood what was wrong . Aunt Tessie had never been away from Fourth Street . Shc had never been anywhere since she had come to America . Aunt Tessie , who George had thought was afraid of nothing but the common cold , was scared stiff by the prospect of leaving the nest iii which she had been holed up all these years . " Listen , " George said , wanting to turn away , wishing he had not seen her like this , and knowing instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that because he had seen her like this , some strands of whatever it was that tied them together had been cut . " I could go to the drug store right now and call Grand Central and find out  --  " " No , " Aunt Tessie said . The anger came sliding back across her face like a mask . " If you go , he 'll make a great big tzimiss about how sick he is . But me , his own sister , me he ca n't fool ! " He did n't even try . Uncle Zisha was so weak , Aunt Tessie re- ported when she got back from Albany ten days later , that the doctor had refused to allow him to sit up in his hospital bed . " Work he 'll never do again , " Aunt Tessie said . " Even to walk again they 're not sure he 'll be able to . Like a baby he is . In the hospital now , it 's nurses . When he goes home , somebody will have to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who ? " George said . Aunt Tessie scowled at the knife as she cut slices from the loaf of bread on the kitchen table . " I do n't know , " she said . " How about Mrs. Gerstenberger ? Any chance of getting her back ? " Aunt Tessie shook her head . " I tried , " she said . " Mrs. Gersten- berger is dead . " George could suddenly smell the fried chicken the stout German woman had put in his lunch box the day he left Albany years ago . Forced all at once to face the fact that the years he had already lived could never be lived again , sensing with uneasiness the speed with which those that still lay ahead were bearing down on him , George had a moment of terror for the passage of time . " There must be somebody else , " he said . " There 's thousands of somebody elses , " Aunt Tessie said . " For thirty dollars a week . " " Oh , " George said. 205 l " All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a millionaire , " Aunt Tessie said bitterly . " Now , in the hospital , all of a sudden what he has , he 's got the house there on Westerlo Street , and from the business , it does n't even belong to him any more , he has a few dollars a week to eat , and it wo n't be gold fish he 'll be able to eat , either . This is all of a sudden what 's left from the millionaire . " " Jesus , " George said . " In the street , with . your friends , it 's Jesus . Here , in the house , it 's English , please . " " All I meant , if Uncle Zisha is that sick and he has n't got the dough  --  " " Dough you can leave outside with the Jesus . In here it 's money . " " Without money to pay for somebody , who 's going to take care of him ? " " Who is it that does things without money , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its way to his mouth . " You 're going back to Albany ? " " You could show me a way maybe how I could take care of Uncle Zisha from here on Fourth Street ? " " How long are you going to stay ? " " A minute ago , when I said the doctors told me he 'll never be able to work again , they said for the rest of his life he 'll need somebody to take care of him like a baby , where were your ears ? " The forkful of stuffed veal completed its journey to George 's mouth . He chewed in silence for a while . Then he pushed aside his plate and stood up . " Where you going ? " Aunt Tessie said . " Out . " " Out where ? " " Just out . " He went through the store and stopped on the stoop , staring across the street at Gerrity 's . There was no sign of life behind the windows which had been painted black with the coming of Prohibition , but George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they came home from their work in the L. L. Parker mailroom , Danny disappeared into the former saloon and did not come out again until it was time for him and George to go to work the next morning . George did n't know what went on inside Gerrity 's these days , and he never asked , but he suspected it was not good . The rumor on Fourth Street was that Danny had his hands full with Mike zo6 Junior , who was supposed to he blind drunk most of the time , and Mrs. Gerrity , who was slowly being paralyzed by arthritis . Nobody on the block felt sorry for either the Gerritys or Danny . On the contrary . There was a general feeling of satisfaction . The wicked , it was felt , were finally getting what they deserved . George wondered sometimes why Danny continued to stay in the red brick house across the street . Now that Danny had a job and was earning good money , he could afford to live anywhere he chose . There were plenty of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way from University Place to Seventh Avenue . Every day , when George and Danny went to work , they saw the VACANCY signs . George wished at the moment that Danny did n't Iive with the Gerritys . If George waited until morning he would see Danny when they went to work or , if George missed him on the way , he would see Danny in the L. L. Parker mailroom . But George did n't feel like waiting . The news Aunt Tessie had brought back from Albany was upsetting . He did n't know what to think about it . He wanted to talk with Danny . He stood there , hesitating , weighing his desire to see Danny against his nameless fear of the house across the street in which he had never set foot , and suddenly George became aware that he was not alone . IIe turned . Dora was watching him from the doorway of the doll store . " Aunt Tessie is back ? " " Yeah , " George said . " She got home this afternoon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could smell cooking . " George came down the stoop and around toward Dora . She stood in the shadows of the darkened store , her thin shoulders bent forward , her bad arm turned away from him . Deep in the back of the store , in the lighted rooms behind the doll factory , Dora 's crazy sister Ida was practicing her scales . " I got tired of listening to her sing , " Dora said . " If you can call it singing . I came out to get some air . I saw you standing there . I  --  " Dora paused , and she looked up at him , and she said quietly , " What 's the matter , George ? " " We have to move to Albany . " Dora 's hand came up to her mouth as though she had been slapped . " You and Aunt Tessie ? " George nodded . " You 're joking , " Dora said . " I wish I was . " 207 1 " Why do you have to move ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone ? " Astonished , George said , " Aunt Tessie ? " Dora nodded . George said , " Quit kidding . " " Who 's kidding ? " " Aunt Tessie ca n't go alone . " " She just did . " " That was for only ten days . Just to see what 's what . But this is for good . Uncle Zisha ca n't work or move or anything . Somebody has to take care of him . She 'll have to live there . " " Why do you have to live there with her ? " The answer was so obvious that it made the question seem silly , and yet George could n't put the answer into words . " It 's not I have to live there with her or I do n't have to live there with her , " he said . " It 's just I ca n't let Aunt Tessie go up there alone . " " What about night school ? What about becoming another judge Brandeis ? " " There 's night schools in Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can , " Dora said . " You can do anything . Why should n't you ? There 's nothing wrong with you . " George did n't realize until he saw her body begin to shake that she was crying . " Dora , for Christ 's sake . " " Shut up . " " Dora , listen . " " Leave me alone . " She turned away , resting her forehead against the door , and George watched helplessly as Dora sobbed in the shadows of the doorway until she began to choke . In the back of the store Ida switched from scales to " Apple Blossom Time , " screaming the song out into the summer night as though the words were being wrung from her by torture . George reached out awkwardly and put his hand on Dora 's shoulder . She squirmed away . " Do n't touch me . " " Dora , listen . " " To what ? " she said bitterly . " The fine time you 're going to have in Albany ? The wonderful things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me again . Rub it in . It does n't matter what you say to me . I 'm just a cripple . I do n't matter . " " Dora , please . Please listen . I  --  " ao8She turned , and suddenly she was leaning against him , sobbing into his shirt , shaking so hard that he had to put his arm around her to keep his balance . " You 're the only friend I have , " she said brokenly , getting the words out in spurts , between gasps for air , so that the choppy phrases emerged like short , muffled screams . " Ida and Frannie , they 're always yelling at mc , I 'm a slob , I do n't do the work right , I do n't earn even my meals and a place to sleep . Ma and Pa , they hate me because I 'm a cripple . Everybody hates a cripple . You 're the only one ever talks to mc . If you go away , I wo n't have anybody . I 'll be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . It was like holding a handful of bones . He could feel the sharp little shoulder blades under his outspread hand , moving with her sobs like the wings of an injured bird . " No , " George said , and he paused , the breath catching in his throat , surprised by something else : her hair smelled fresh and sweet , like Aunt Tessie 's honey cake . " Dora , listen , " George said . " You wo n't be alone , " he whispered . " I promise . " In the long silence that followed he found himself wishing Ida would stop screaming that damned song . he had to think of a good way to break the news to Aunt Tessie that he was not going to Albany with her. 12There were no good ways . George found that out three weeks later , the night before Aunt Tessie 's departure . " The train they say it leaves eleven o'clock tomorrow morning , " she said . " But these shkutzim that run the railroads , who can trust them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tomorrow morning , in Grand Central , we 'll be there half past ten , maybe even a little earlier . We 'll make sure they do n't leave us behind . " George stared at her . Was it possible that she had n't heard a word he 'd said during the past three weeks ? Or was she merely pretendingshe had n't heard ? " They 'll leave one of us behind , " George said . " I 'm not going to Albany . " 209 " It 's too much to shlep our suitcases from here to the Tenth Street car and then in the subway , " Aunt Tessie said , as though he had not spoken . " We 'll call up by the drug store they should send a taxi . " " That 's a good idea , " George said . " Because I wo n't be able to help you take your stuff to Grand Central . I 'll be working . " Aunt Tessie straightened up . They were standing among the racks and machines and chairs in the dismantled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noftooleh , the second-hand furnituredealer from Avenue C , had placed on the equipment after the weeks of haggling over price with Aunt Tessie had finally ended in a compromise late that afternoon , shortly before George came home from his job in the L. L. Parker mailroom . " You 'll be working ? " Aunt Tessie said slowly , as though he had announced that he would be slaughtering hogs . " Tomorrow morning you 'll be working ? " " I work every morning . I 've got a job . You know that . " " But tomorrow morning we 're going to Albany , " Aunt Tessie said , even more slowly . " To live with Uncle Zisha . " " You 're going to Albany to live with Uncle Zisha , " George said . " Not me . " He spoke with great care , keeping his eyes fixed on her face , as though they were approaching each other from different ends of a tight rope and he was afraid that the slightest deviation , the faintest increase in the decibels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 've been telling you for three weeks , " George said . " I 'm not going to live in Albany . I rented a room today on University Place . I 'm staying here in New York . " There were several moments of silence , and then Aunt Tcssie 's thin body seemed to move slightly inside the long black alpaca dress she had worn ever since he had known her . It was as though somewhere in the machinery that kept her going the gears had been shifted . " I never should have gone to Houston Street to get you , " she said . " I should have left you there where I found you , by Henry Isaacs . " " You do n't mean that , " George said . " You 're only saying it because you 're angry . " " How do you want I should say it ? With laughing ? " no " I do n't want you to say anything . All I want you to do is understand . " " You want I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means to be all your life skinny like a needle and crooked-looking like a burned lottke ? So people , instead of coming to touch you , to talk , to like you , the minute they see you they pick up their feet and they run ? You understand maybe what it means to sit and to watch , that 's all , just to sit and watch while other womenthey get married and they have children , and you , what you have , you have inside where other people have a full heart , by you it 's like an empty pocketbook ? You know maybe what it means when you 're already no spring chicken , you go to Henry Isaacs , you see a little boy , you take him home , and inside here , where it 's an empty pocketbook , all of a sudden it 's full ? All of a sudden , no matter what it says in the mirror , you 're no more skinny like a needle , you 're no more crooked-looking ? Because all of a sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means to have this for fourteen years , for fourteen years to be like other people , and then in a one , two , three , with a handful words , all of a sudden the whole thing is nothing , it 's again inside like an empty pocketbook ? This you understand , maybe ? " If she would only scream , George thought . If she would only wave her arms or look hysterical . But she did n't scream , and she did n't wave her arms , and she did n't look hysterical . She stood up ramrod straight , the black-sheathed pipcstcm arms folded across her narrow little chest , her voice flat and calm , her words unhurried and evenly spaced , as though she were dictating a telegram over the phone , and it was a long , long time , or so it seemed , before the swelling in George 's throat cased enough to allow him to speak . " I 'm not dying or going to Europe , " he said , feeling helpless in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open her heart and yet never for a moment diminish the pride that held her together and kept her untouched , safe from the erosion of pity . " Albany is only a few hours away , " George said . " I 'll be coming up all the time to visit you . " " Me you 'll come to visit , but Mr. Danny Schorr , with him you 'll stay here to live . " Astonished , George said , " Danny ? What 's Danny got to do with it ? " " From the beginning , from the first day you saw him fourteen 211 years ago , anything he wanted he could do with you . " A touch of bitterness rose to the surface of the flat , calm voice . " The only thing I never knew , the only thing it never walked into my head , was that the day would come when he would take you away from me . " " He 's not taking me away from you . It 's not because of Danny that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in my ears , but they wo n't change what I see with my eyes . " " I do n't care what you see , " George said angrily , furious with her for not being furious , for denying him with her self-control the relief he might have obtained from meeting rage with rage . " You 're not seeing it right . " " No ? " she said . " No , " George said . " It 's not because of Danny that I 'm staying in New York . " The thin lips twisted in a small , mocking smile . " So because of who is it , then ? " Aunt Tessie said . " Who ? " George started to tell her , but all at once he could feel again the sharp little shoulder blades that were like the wings of a wounded bird under his outspread hand , and he could smell again the hair that reminded him of Aunt Tessie 's honey cake fresh from the oven , and he could n't get the words out .

Parker mailroom , was fond of saying that his department was to the large organization what gasoline is to the Cadillac . He said it every morning at eight-fifteen . " Most people look at a Cadillac and all they see is a great big shiny car , " he said . " They never stop to think that without gasoline , the stuff they ca n't see at all , that great big shiny car would be about as useful as a statue in the park . The same with us . Most people look at L. L. Parker Stores and all they see is a live-wire organization that stretches clear across the country from Maine to California , from Washington to Florida , from the Canadian to the Mexican border. 212They never stop to think that without this mailroom here on Fifteenth Street , something they do n't even know exists , the L. L. Parker Stores would stop functioning in twenty-four hours . " This was an exaggeration , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores sending in daily sales reports , requests for merchandise , and a dozen or more other types of communications standardized by efficiency experts to insure the smoothest possible relationship between the brain center of a commercial octopus and its outlying tentacles , the four small basement rooms on Fifteenth Street , through which every scrap of this paper stream had to flow , could very easily have become a serious bottleneck . The fact that the L. L. Parker mailroom was not a bottleneck could be attributed entirely to the unique personality and special talents of Friedrich Feuer Shumachcr , who was known to his staff , when they were addressing him directly , as Eff Eff , or , when they were talking about him among themselves , as Fart Face . It did not require a particularly active imagination to figure out how the nickname had come into being . F. F. Shumacher was a tall , thin man in his early sixties , with neatly combed snow-white hair , sallow , spotted skin that looked like used flypaper , false teeth so badly fitted that they clacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been out of place in a barnyard , and the fussy mannerisms of a nervous old lady trying to get through a subway turnstile during the rush hour while carrying half a dozen greased cantaloupes . Every morning at eight o'clock he gathered all sixteen members of his staff around two ping-pong tables placed side by side in the largest of the department 's four rooms . Standing four abreast on all sides of the large square they looked a good deal like players in a gambling casino gathered around an outsize roulette table . Mr. Shumacher , circling happily on the outskirts of the square , dumping across the shoulders of his staff scoops of mail from the sacks that had been brought over from the post office , looked like a demented farmer flinging feed to a brood of chickens he had trained to consume , like pigs , food from a common trough . At eight-fifteen , satisfied that the staff was snatching the mail at a good rate of speed from the common pile in the middle of the ping-pong tables and sorting it nicely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and launch into the speech that explained why his department was to the large organizationwhat gasoline is to the Cadillac. 213 By the time he had been on the job several weeks , George Hurst was good and sick of this comparison . It took him a little longer to lose his admiration for the ping-pong tables , which were Eff Eff 's brainchild . Until he gave birth to it , the L. L. Parker mail had been sorted for almost three decades on various pieces of furniture scattered withoutplan throughout the four rooms . When Eff Eff took over the department , this arrangement bothered him . Not because it was inefficient but because it seemed to him unfriendly to have his staff spread out all over the place . His instincts being those of a mother hen , Eff Eff liked to have his entire brood under his benevolent glance at all times . The two ping-pong tables accomplished this purpose beautifully . Their other accomplishment , though completely unintentional , was what kept the mailroom from becoming a bottleneck : working as one group in full view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups spread through four rooms , the mailroom staff , from the very first day the new system went into operation , clipped twenty minutes from the best time ever before recorded for the morning sorting chore . So many congratulations on this accomplishment poured in from department heads all over the organization , that Eff Eff , as delighted as a parent whose children have brought good report cards home from school , decided to reward his official family . He eliminated the staggeredlunch hour that had been in operation for years , arranged with a catering company to deliver box lunches to the mailroom , and insisted that the whole staff lunch together every day , in a happy group , around the ping-pong tables that had been and continued to be the field of their triumph . If there were any employees who were somewhat less than enthusiasticabout this arrangement , seeing some virtues in the old system under which they had been free to go out for the midday meal and thus remove themselves for an hour from Eff Eff 's relentless clacking chatter about the delights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the home office in record time , they had enough sense to keep their traps shut . George had not realized , during his first days on the job , that the communal lunch was compulsory . He had been so busy learning the routine that , when the caterer 's man came around at eleven-thirty with the lunch boxes , he bought one without giving it a second thought , and , a half hour later , when Mr. Shumacher and the other employees began to pull chairs up to the ping-pong tables , George had pulled 214 lone up for himself . A few days later , when he had mastered the rather primitive routine of the job and was free to think about other matters , the communal lunch hour began to give him a swift pain in the neck . The trouble was that Mr. Shumacher fancied himself as a Jewish dialect comedian . Ordinarily , George did not mind jokes about Jews any more than he minded jokes about Republicans or channel swimmers . He had grown accustomed in high school , through Fott Fromkin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged , to the traditional anecdote that rested solidly on those three stock characters : Mike the Harp , Tony the Wop , and Izzy the Heeb . George had told his share of these jokes . But he had always told them to other Jewish boys , and while not all the jokes he 'd heard had been told exclusively by Jews , George had never heard them under circumstances that were quite the same as those that existed around the ping-gong tables presided over by Mr. Shumacher : at that relentlessly festive board George Hurst traveled  --  or , more accurately perhaps , squirmed  --  under false colors . From the moment he had written the word " Lutheran " on his employment application , George had never been free from the knowledge that he was living a lie . The lie did not bother him too much . Aunt Tessie had managed through the years to impress on him the general proposition that honesty was the best policy , even though the evidence of his own eyes indicated quite clearly that this was not always so , but George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not the equivalent of signing a death warrant . It was probably better not to lie , but , if you had to do it , you did it . Having done it , instead of counting on God to come along and strike you dead , you could actually count more heavily on His not even being aware of your existence . There was , therefore , no point in crying or even thinking about any one particular lie . Danny Schorr 's hard-headed clarificationof the issue continued to impress George as sound . You had to decide what you wanted and then keep your eye on the ball until you got it or , once you got it , for as long as you wanted to hold onto it . What George wanted was this job in the L. L. Parker mailroom . Without it , or a job at least as good , he could not continue to live and study in New York , and so far as he could see from the want ads , no other jobs of any kind were available at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , George was willing , five 215 days a week from eight in the morning until six at night and half a day on Saturday , to live the pretense that he was not a Jew . I-ie did not find it a very difficult thing to do . Except during lunch hour . When Mr. Shumacher , seated with his happy staff around the ping-pong tables , embarked on one of his stories , George could feel the skin on the side of his jaw begin to crawl and the food go dry in his mouth . In a few moments , when Eff Eff reached the punch line , his staff would explode into roars of appreciative laughter . George could not join them . He did n't understand why . In an organization run by policies drawn from the mind of a man like L. L. Parker , references somewhat less than complimentary to Jews were not rare in the day 's work . George could and did dismiss these with a mental shrug . Or , when the remark was made to him directly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , while it kept George 's conscience clear , left with the person to whom it was addressed the impression that George shared his point of view . Why , then , when Mr. Shumacher told one of his lousy jokes , could n't George guffaw with the rest ? What was the gap that separated this particular act of hypocrisy from the others he performed so easily ? George did n't know . He knew only that he found it impossible to laugh at Eff Eff 's stories . As a result George knew also that before long his failure to appreciate the boss 's humor would be noticed . It was easy enough to imagine the chain of events that would follow : puzzlementwould lead to suspicion , suspicion to investigation , and investigationto firing . George could not afford to allow that to happen . Even if he could get another job fairly soon , which the want-ad sections made it plain was highly unlikely , being out of work for no matter how short a period would mean serious trouble . Four of the twelve dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the remaining eight he had to pay for his food , buy his clothes , and take care of his tuition at Washington Square College . Every week was a race against insolvency . The fact that thus far he had been winning it , was no assurance that he would continue to do so . Ile had absolutely no cushion to fall back on , and the only two people from whom he could even imagine trying to borrow , should an emergency arise , were in worse financial shape than he was : Aunt T'essie 's last letter from Albany had reported that Uncle Zisha , in order to meet his medical bills , had been forced to put a second mortgage on the Westerlo Street house ; and Danny , who rarely talked about his rela- 216 tionship with the Gerritys , had several times during the past few weeks surprised George by remarking bitterly that he was getting sick and tired of sweating his ass off in the L. L. Parker mailroom to keep Mike Junior in booze and Mike 's old lady in medicine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able , when Mr. Shumacher delivered one of his punch lines , to laugh as hard as the others gathered around the ping-pong tables . Danny knew what he wanted , just as George did . The difference was that Danny was able to get it without tying himself up in knots . If , in order to hold onto his job , he had to laugh at Eff Eff 's jokes , Danny laughed . George wished he could do the same . Sitting there with a mouthful of sandwich growing tasteless and then sour on his tongue , looking around at the grinning faces of Mr. Shumacher and his staff , George was reminded of the shkutzim who used to go in and out of Gerrity 's saloon when he was a kid , and of the way he used to feel about the enemy stronghold across the street . Danny had never been afraid of that stronghold . Danny 's lack of fear was paying off now . Eff Eff and his staff were to Danny just another bunch of shkutzim , like the coalwagondrivers and lumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , and if there was anything Danny Schorr knew , he knew how to handle shkutzim . George , who did n't , decided after several uncomfortable weeks at the ping-pong tables that the only solution to his problem was to go away from there . Three days later he learned he had made a mistake . " Oh , George , " Mr. Shumacher called when George came back to the mailroom at one o'clock . " Could I see you a moment ? " George went over to the roll-top desk where Eff Eff fooled around with papers when he was n't supervising the sorting of mail or telling funny stories about Jews . " Yes , sir ? " George said . " We 've missed you at lunch . " There was a note in the old boob 's gentle voice that went off in George 's head like a fire alarm . " I 've been going out to eat , " George said . " So I 've noticed , " Mr. Shumacher said . " Do n't you like to eat lunch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What is it , George ? " " Well  --  " " You can speak up and be honest with me , George . " 217 l " Well , I ca n't afford those box lunches . " While this was not , of course , the real reason , the statement was true enough . According to the budget George had worked out for himself as soon as Aunt Tessie went to Albany and he was on his own , he could spend sixty-five cents a day on food . His breakfast , which consisted of two rolls and a glass of milk , cost him ten cents in Stewart 's Cafeteria diagonally across the street from his rooming house on University Place . At six-thirty in the same cafeteria , before he went to his first class after finishing his day 's work in the L. L. Parker mailroom , George could get for thirty-five cents a meat or fish dish with two vegetables and bread and butter , a nickel dessert , and another glass of milk . This left him with twenty cents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten around the mailroom ping-pong tables cost thirty-five cents . As a result , during the time he had attended Mr. Shumacher 's luncheon parties , George had been forced to omit dessert and a beverage from his evening meals . I-lc did n't like to antagonize his boss . But he did n't like going to bed feeling hungry , either . " You mean to say , George , you ca n't afford thirty-five cents to join your colleagues for the period of relaxation to which we all look forward from the moment we begin our excellent work at eight in the morning and from which we all draw the invigorating juices that recharge our batteries and enable us to sustain the same high pitch of excellence for the balance of the day ? " Oy gevollt , George thought . " It is n't that , Mr. Shumacher , " he said . " You mean there 's another reason ? " " Well  --  " " Are you trying to say , George , that when you just said you have been going out to lunch because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were not telling me the truth ? " " No , sir . " " Then what are you trying to say ? " " Nothing , sir . " The skin that looked like spotted flypaper drew together around Mr. Shumacher 's lips like the neck of a sack narrowing down when the drawstring is pulled . It reminded George of the malicious smile that appeared on Mr. Forman 's puss when the Fourth Street grocer was getting ready to let go with a real mean one about Aunt Tessie. 218 All bastards , whether shkutzim or heebs , apparently looked the same way when they were doing what came naturally . " In other words , then , George , you really had no intention of , how shall I put it , yes , no intention of boycotting our lunch parties here in the mailroom ? " " No , sir . " " It was merely an oversight ? " " Yes , sir . " " From now on we can count on you to join us around the pingpongtables every day at noon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm very pleased , George . I 'm sure the rest of our staff will be pleased , too . " At least one member of it was , anyway . That night , when George left the office , he found Danny waiting for him on the sidewalk . " What did Eff Eff have you on the mat for ? " he said as they started off side by side toward Fifth Avenue . George told him . " I been meaning to ask you myself how come you were n't around for lunch the last couple of days . " There was no point in telling him the real reason . Danny , who understood pretty damn near everything , would not understand what George himself did n't understand : why he could n't laugh at Mr. Shumacher 's jokes . " It 's those lousy box lunches , " George said instead . " Those ham sandwiches . Pieces of cardboard with a shmeer of pink paint in between . An orange or an apple big as a walnut , and a hunk of pie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel it . Thirty-five cents down the drain , my insides are grinding , and half the dough for my supper is shot . Over on Sixth Avenue , or a little further down on Fourteenth Street , near Third , for twenty cents I get a knish and a couple of hot dogs and a glass of milk , and I 've got something holding the sides of my stomach apart . Anyway , I did have , these last three days , " George said sourly . " Tomorrow I go back to those crummy lunch boxes . " " And those crummy jokes . " Surprised , George gave Danny a quick glance . he was walking along with his hands in his pockets , scowling at the ground and kickinghis heels down hard with each step , as though the sidewalk was in some way responsible for the black mood that had suddenly closed in on him . George was reminded of the way Danny used to look on 219 lFourth Street when he had to wait for somebody , shifting his weight impatiently from foot to foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , his thin , wiry body hopping around like spit on a hot stove . That was the thing about Danny . He could n't wait . He was like one of those horses that pulled the O'Brien Coal wagons when the shkutz on the driver 's seat was holding him in tight with the reins . You could see that horse pulling like crazy to bust out . You could see Danny doing the same . You could feel it . And you knew that whatever it was , some day it was going to give . It had to . Nothing could hold Danny forever . " I thought you liked Eff Eff 's jokes , " George said . " You 're sure picking up some bright thoughts these days . " " I 've got plenty of reason , " George said . " Every time the old bastard gets to one of his punch lines , you look like you 're trying to bust a gut . " Danny made a growling sound of disgust somewhere deep in his throat . He spit into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job in that dump , that 's the way you 'd better sound , too . " " Beginning tomorrow , " George said dryly , " I 'm going to try . " Danny punched his left fist into his right palm in a sudden explosion of impatience . " God damn it , " he said . " God damn it . God damn it . " He banged his palm again . " If only I did n't have that dead-head drunk and his old lady on my hands ! " He did n't seem to be talking to George . He was apparently cutting into a talk he 'd been having with himself below the surface of the conversation he 'd been carrying on with George . It was obviously the same running conversation out of which , during the past weeks , had come the seemingly irrelevant remarks that he was tired of working in the L. L. Parker mailroom to keep Mike Gerrity , Jr. , in booze and Mrs. Gerrity in medicine . It occurred to George that maybe those remarks had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a strain on George 's budget , maybe it was worse for Danny . Danny did n't have to pay tuition at WashingtonSquare College or rent for a room on University Place . But he did have to support , or for some reason felt he had to support , Mike Gerrity , Jr. , and Mrs. Gerrity . For the first time in all the years they had known each other , George suddenly felt it was all right to raise the forbidden subject . " Why do n't you quit having them on your hands ? " he said . " Why do n't you just walk out of there ? " " I ca n't , " Danny said. 2aoJ " Why not ? " " I said I ca n't . " " And I said why not ? " " I just ca n't , that 's all . " To George , who was not accustomed to seeing his cocky , selfconfidentfriend in a defeated mood , it was not all . " Look , " he said warming to his idea . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the opportunity it presented to be helpful to the despondent Danny , it seemed bright with suddenpromise . " You could move in with me , " George said . " It 's a pretty big room . In addition to the bed , I 've got this studio couch . You could have whichever one you wanted to sleep on , and we could split the rent in half . That way , not only would I be saving two bucks a week , which believe me I could sure use , but you would n't have to be shelling out for the Gerritys . Aside from your half of the rent , you 'd have all the rest of the salary for yourself . With that much of an edge , sort of pooling our dough that way , we could even maybe take a chance , knock off for a day once in a while and go look for better jobs . Any kind of a break , and you would n't have to do any more laughing at Eff Eff . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , stopped short in the middle of painting his glowing portrait of their common future , blinked as though he had come out of a dark room into the sunlight . " What kind of a putz melamed do you think I am ? " Danny said . " All these years , the time and work and everything else I invested in that drunken shmiggeggie and his old lady , I should walk out on the whole thing now and let somebody else move in ? " His thin , handsome face had lost its uncertainty . The brown eyes were crackling with restless light , as though they were mirrors picking up reflections from a pinwheel . The lips were pulled over to one side in the tight little half-smile through which , when he was going good , Danny Schorr 's words emerged like slugs of metal type dropping crisply into waiting slots . " All I was trying to do , " George said , " I was just trying to help . " " Here 's how you do your helping , " Danny said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like all the rest of us aroundthat ping-pong table so Shumacher wo n't get suspicious and start askingquestions and maybe find out you 're no more a Lutheran thanI 'm Benny Leonard . Because once he finds that out , he 'll start on 221 everybody else with Lutheran on their application blanks , which means me , and while no job that pays twelve bucks a week is my idea of heaven , until I get ready to tell him where he can stick it , I need that job and I want to hold onto it . Understand ? " What George did not understand was Danny 's reference to the time and work he had invested in Gerrity 's . A few months later , when George was down on Fourth Street visiting Dora Dienst one Sunday , he found out . Neither George nor Dora had ever discussed these Sunday visits . They came about so naturally that George never even thought about them . If he had , his whole life would have been different . For a while after Aunt Tessie went to Albany he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Place , his job on Fifteenth Street , and his night classes on Washington Square . Then , one day , he was all settled , and with the shock of an unexpected physical blow he came up against an emotion that was completely new to him : loneliness . All the days of his life up to now there had been no piece of any twenty-four-hour period when George was not in one way or another relating to someone he cared about or who cared about him . If it was n't Danny sending him a message by tin can down thc backyardwall about an important meeting in Forman 's , or Dora waiting in the doll store for him to bring her a juicy anecdote about his day at Franklin Pierce High , it was Aunt Tessie bawling him out for getting the sleeves of his sweater wet . Even when he was asleep George slept with the unconscious but reassuring knowledge that Aunt Tessie was ten feet away , in the bed near the kitchen stove , and Danny was in his room across the street in Gerrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll store at the other side of the stoop . When Aunt Tessie went to Albany and George moved to University Place , all that changed . He still saw Danny every day , but seeing him in the mailroom at L. L. Parker was not the same as seeing him on Fourth Street . And late at night , when George got back to his room after classes , he was suddenly aware of the distance that separated him from Aunt Tessie and Danny and Dora . The awareness hurt . It was like carrying around a lump in your chest . George tried for a while to push the lump away by working hard in school and by writing long letters to Aunt Tessie , but he did n't 222 succeed in pushing it very far . The most helpful thing , what sustainedhim most , was the knowledge that he had a goal . Staring at the silver-framed picture of Judge Brandeis on the table near his bed , George did n't mind being lonely . Or he could pretend for a while that he did n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel this way if you were working toward something big . He did n't understand how the ambition had taken such fierce hold , how the desire of Uncle Zisha , a man George had seen only once for a couple of weeks a dozen years ago , had been transplantedintact , but George was grateful that it had been transplanted . 1-Ie knew what he wanted . He knew where he was going . If the process of getting there meant feeling cut off and alone , that was all right with him . It was all right for a while . Then one day when the pain came crowding back at him so powerfully that it was almost unbearable , George suddenly realized the next day was Sunday . He did n't have to go to work . He had no classes . Ile had a book report to write for English , and ten pages from Le Livre 1 ) e Mon Ami to translate for his French class , and four chapters iii his economics textbook to digestfor an oral quiz the following night , but George figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up early and walked across town to see the Diensts . They were all in the store , working hard on a rush order , but after they had asked a lot of questions about how he liked his job and what was he learning in night school and what did he hear from Aunt Tessie , Mrs. Dicnst suddenly announced that they were all caught up with their work , and there were too many people in the store , anyway , so why did n't George and Dora go out for a walk ? " Better watch where you 're walking , " Ida said , and she grinned as she rolled her eyes crazily . " ' Phis street ends in a river , you know . " " You , you better know to watch the long tongue , " Mrs. Dienst snapped , and then , to George and Dora , " Go , children , go . " They went down to the river and sat on the dock , where they watched the barges go by as they talked . At any rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splinters out of the weathered wood and dropping them into the river . It was like those afternoons when George used to come back from Franklin Pierce and drop into the doll store . Dora seemed to be listening with interest , but George had the feeling that she did n't really hear what he was saying . She sat hunched forward , shielding her crooked arm with the curve of her 223 1body , watching the ripples spread out from the splinters she tossed down into the water . The invisible wall she had built around herselfafter the Armistice Day accident was still there . George could feel it , forcing him to respect her unspoken desire to keep the world at a distance , but he could feel something else , too . He could feel the lump of loneliness in his chest ease away as he talked . He would have preferred to have Dora come out from behind the invisible wall , from the secret place she had built for herself and in which she felt safe , but the fact that she did n't was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her made him feel . So George went right on talking . Late that night , after he 'd had supper with the Diensts in the kitchen behind the doll store and he was back in his room on UniversityPlace working on Le Livre De Mon Ami , George tried to remember what he had talked to Dora about , but he could n't . He could n't remember a damn thing . He felt better than he 'd felt for a long time , though , and when he finished his work and climbed into bed and pulled out the light , he was already looking forward to next Sunday . It was very much like the preceding Sunday , which proved to be not much different from all the Sundays that followed . ' 1'lie only change was dictated by the weather . If it rained or snowed or was too cold for sitting on the dock , George and Dora sat in the doll store with the other members of the Dienst family , and George talked while they worked on a rush order . There was always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group as much as he liked talking to Dora alone . Not because Dora 's sisters and parents were bored by what George had to say . On the contrary . They were a much better audience , especially Mr. and Mrs. Dienst and fat Frannie , who watched George 's face as he talked and kept nodding their heads as though to urge him on . When he paused , Frannie always said eagerly , " Say some more , George ! " and Mrs. Dienst would hand him an apple or a banana as though bribing him to continue . George continued , because he was beginning to discover that he enjoyed talking to a group , but he still wished it was n't raining or snowing so that he and Dora could go out to the dock where be could talk to her alone . He did n't know why . It was just better out on the dock with Dora . It also proved to be more revealing . One Sunday , when they were sitting in the sun and George was telling her how many pre- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square College before he could enter law school , and how many more years this would take , it suddenly seemed to him that he could hear voices . George stopped and listened . " Sounds like somebody singing , " he said . " If you can call it singing , " Dora said . The bitterness in her voice reminded George of something . For several moments he did n't know what it was . Then he remembered the night in the darkened doorway of the doll store when , as he told Dora he was not going to Albany with Aunt Tessie , Ida 's voice from somewhere in the back had been screaming " Apple BlossomTime " across their heads . " Sounds like Ida , " George said . " Why should n't it sound like Ida ? " Dora said . George looked at her in puzzlement , and Dora said , " Come on . " She led him from the dock to the gate that separated Forrester Box &; Lumber from O'Brien Coal , and into the Forest . Years had passed since George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he followed Dora down a long aisle , between the lumber stacks that led from the river toward Lewis Street , he was caught up in the remembered horror of Armistice Day . George looked quickly at Dora . If her thoughts were anywhere near the subject that filled his own , it did not show on her face . As they approached the fence that marked the end of the Forest and the beginning of Gerrity 's back yard , the voice George had heard on the dock grew louder . When they reached the fence , Dora stopped . So did George . He looked across the fence , at the rear of the red-brick house , then at Dora , and back at the house . There did n't seem to be any doubt about it . From somewhere inside Gerrity 's the voice of Ida Dienst , to the accompaniment of what sounded like a piano , was screaming " Apple Blossom Time . " George turned back to Dora . " That 's Ida , " he said . Dora nodded . George said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She calls it singing . " Somehow this did n't seem to be enough of an answer . " Who 's in there with her ? " Dora shrugged . " How should I know ? I 've never been inside the place . " Something in her manner suggested a clue . " But Ida has ? " George said. fl 225 " These last few weeks , more than a month already , she 's been in there every night and all day Sunday . " " Doing what ? " " Ca n't you hear her ? " " Why is she doing it ? " " She says she 's practicing . " " Practicing for what ? " Dora shrugged again . " Why do n't you ask Mr. Danny Shorr ? That rotten little shkutz lover is your friend , not mine . " George asked him the next day , in the L. L. Parker washroom . Danny laughed . " You look like you think I 'm putting the boots to her . " " That 's not what I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're thinking . I can tell by your puss . Well , you can quit thinking . When I want a piece of shtipp , I do n't have to go looking for it around a dog like Ida Dienst . " " Then what 's she doing there , singing in Gerrity 's ? " " Come on down Thursday night and I 'll show you . " " I 've got classes Thursday night . " " Skip them for once and maybe you 'll learn something they do n't put into books . " " I ca n't do that . They allow you only a certain number of cuts . I have to save them for when I 'm sick . " " What time do you get out ? " " A quarter to ten . " " That 's time enough , " Danny said . " If you come right down . " He pulled a couple of paper towels from the holder over the basin , started punching his hands dry , then stopped . " Will you be there ? " George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it carefully , taking a long time about it . When he straightened up , Danny was still standing there motionless , holding the wad of paper towels like a pitcher caught by the camera in the act of pulling back his arm for the throw . " How about it ? " Danny said . " Will you be there ? " " I do n't know , " George said as he pulled a towel from the holder . " When I get out of class I 'm pretty bushed , and I 've got all this homework to get ready for the next night . " Danny grinned and put his arm across George 's shoulder . " Your Aunt Tessie is all the way up there in Albany , " he said . " I promise not to write and squeal to her . " 226 " For Christ 's sake , " George said . " Aunt Tessie has nothing to do with it . " " No ? " " No . " Danny drew him slowly close in the bend of his elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked in a straining grip , until they were nose to nose . " Now say no , " Danny said . George twisted himself free . Danny straightened up , let out a bellow of laughter , and hurled the wadded paper towels across the washroom . " Honest to God , " he said . " I swear to you we have n't boiled a heeb for supper since last Tuesday . I promise you 'll be as safe as when you 're listening to one of Shumacher 's jokes . How about it ? " " Well  --  " George said . Then he caught a glimpse of Danny 's face in the mirror over the basin , and he started to laugh , too . How the hell could anybody say no to Danny ? " Sure , " George said , " I 'll be there . " " You just saying that to get out of this can ? " Danny said . " Or is it a promise ? " " It 's a promise , " George said . He wished , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Thursday night , that he could retract the promise . His curiosity about what Danny had cooked up was strong . As strong as it used to be when they were kids and the tin can would come banging gently down the back-yard wall carrying one of Danny 's messages . Just as when they were kids , however , the mere thought of Gerrity 's was enough to make George uncomfortable . Tonight he was dealing with more than thoughts . Tonight , knowing he had promised to meet Danny inside Gerrity 's , George knew also that he was more than uncomfortable . he was scared . It was silly . It was stupid . Considering that he was going to be twenty years old on his next birthday , George knew it was even shocking . What the hell was there to be scared of ? A dirty old red brick building ? The fact that it had once been a crummy saloon and , since Prohibition came in , had been functioning as an even crummier speakeasy ? The old woman crippled by arthritis whose husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son ? The bargemen and wagon drivers to whom they sold their cheap rotgut ? George 's intelligence told him that none of these was anything or anybody to be afraid of . Especially since Danny had them all in227the palm of his hand . But in that place to which George 's intelligence refused to penetrate , deep down where it clearly did not matter how sensible were the arguments he presented to himself , the thought of actually setting foot in Gerrity 's evoked the same feelings that had hit him years ago , on the day Aunt Tessie first brought him to Fourth Street from the Henry Isaacs Orphan Asylum and , drawing him close as she stared across the street , she had uttered the single , terrifyingword : shkutzim ! Two of them , George saw as he reached the Lewis Street corner , were just going in . He stood at the curb for a few moments , looking across the dark street at the closed door through which the shkutzim had disappeared , wondering if it might not be a good idea to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him . He did n't wonder very long . Considering the way Dora hated Danny , few ideas could be dumber . Besides , Danny 's opinion of Dora was even lower than her opinion of him . On top of all that , Dora had not been invited . Telling himself to quit stalling , George stepped from the curb , crossed the street , and knocked on the black wooden door . While he waited he noticed in the light from the lamppost behind him that the door was freshly painted , and he heard the murmur of voices behind it . The door slid open about four or five inches . Through the gap , along with the voices , came the sharp smell of cigarette smoke mixed with alcohol . Nothing happened for several moments . George could n't see anything in the narrow gap , but he had the feeling he was being looked over by someone inside . " Yeah ? " a man 's voice said finally . " Danny Shorr told me to come over . " " What 's your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the sound of a chain bolt being pulled free and then the door jerked open . " Come on in . " George came into what looked like a small , dark closet perhaps six feet square . Behind him the door was shoved shut . One wall of the closet began to sway crazily , as though it had been punched back by a muffled giant fist . Light from somewhere beyond the wall poured in . George saw that the closet was actually a set of long black curtains hung around the street door to form a crude vestibule . He saw also that the man who had let him in was Mike Gerrity , Jr . George had never been this close to him before . He found 228 he could n't take his eyes from Mike 's left jacket sleeve . It was pinned up at the elbow . " Danny said to let him know as soon as you showed , " Mike said . " Come on . " There was something about the way he pronounced Danny 's name that brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly into Mike 's face , George had a moment of shock . Like everybody else on Fourth Street , he knew that Mike had been twenty-two when he lost his arm at Chateau- IThierry . He could n't , therefore , have been more than thirty-five now . But the man who had opened the door looked almost as old as Mr. Shumacher . Not because he had white hair . Mike 's hair was the color of spit-out tobacco juice . But his skin was dirty and spotty , like Eff Eff 's . His eyes had the runny blue look of raw egg - white . He kept pulling his lower lip up to his teeth and then letting it drop away again , as though he kept forgetting that the gums were red-hot . He moved jerkily and slowly , with pauses between each movement , like a clockworktoy that had to be wound up for each step . Forgetting that a few moments ago , on the other side of the door , he had been scared , George was surprised to find he felt sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guy was a lush . It was another thing to see and smell him . Mike smelled like a turned-over kerosene lamp . " You better come on , " he said . his words sounded like dice with worn-away edges rolling out on a padded table top . They had no crispness . " I do n't want Danny to get sore , " he mumbled . " Come on . " He pulled aside the curtain and held it for George to precede him . George had another shock . Is this all ? he was suddenly asking himself . Is this all ? For years George had carried in his mind a picture that showed the inside of Gerrity 's . The picture was vague at the edges , which kept moving back and forth endlessly , like surf , but in the center the picture was clear enough : a tangled mass of dirty men in work pants and flannel shirts , with vicious faces , packed together in a writhing mass like angleworms in a tin can , holding glasses and slobbering whiskey down their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spitting on the sawdust-covered floor and screaming curses at the Jews who lived in the buildings all around them . What George actually saw through the curtain Mike Gerrity , Jr. , held aside for him was a room about the size of Mr. Forman 's grocery 229store . The black wooden floor , like the street door , was freshly painted and the walls were hung with cheaply framed pictures , most of them obviously cut from newspapers and magazines , of Eddie Cantor , Marilyn Miller , Rudolph Valentino and other well-known entertainers . At one side , to the left of the curtain , there was a bar with a mirror behind it . Facing the bar from the other side of the room , near a door that apparently led to the rest of the house , was a small upright piano in front of which sat an old woman in a black shawl playing soft , tinkly music . Like the half-dozen tables on the floor and the chairs set around the tables , none of which matched , the piano had also recently received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal the nicks and scars which indicated that , if the furniture in the room had not come from Mr. Noftooleh 's on Avenue C , it had obviously been supplied by some other second-hand dealer who specialized in equally beat-up merchandise . Perhaps a dozen men and women were seated at the tables in groups of two and three . They were neatly dressed , and they either sat quietly , listening to the music , or they spoke to each other in whispers , as though they did not want to be rude to the old woman at the piano . They did not seem particularlyinterested in the glasses on the tables in front of them . George tried , as he stared at the room in front of him , to synchronizewhat he was seeing with the picture of Gerrity 's interior he had been carrying in his mind for so many years . Ilc could n't . It was like steeling yourself at a fraternity initiation to take a puff on what you are sure is an exploding cigar and then finding , when you put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chocolate . " What do you think of it ? " George turned . Danny had come up beside him . He was wearing a dark blue suit George had never seen before and he was grinning . George , who had been with him all day in the L. L. Parker mailroom , found himself looking at Danny as though he were seeing a stranger . In a way he was . He had never seen Danny look like this . Ilc remindedGeorge of the men in newspaper photographs of commencementexercises at which the awards are about to be handed out to the honor men . Even without reading the captions , just by looking at the row of faces , you could tell which one was going to get the top prize . Whatever prizes were being handed out tonight , George could tell from looking at his friend 's face that Danny knew he had it in the bag . For the first time in all the years George had known him , Danny did n't look impatient. 2 30 l " I do n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " Danny 's grin changed to a look of annoyance . " For Christ 's sake , what does it look like ? " A number of answers came to George 's mind . " You 'd get sore if I told you , " he said . " I 'd better let you tell me . " " It 's a night club , " Danny said . George had never been in a night club . He took another look at this one . " Do they all look like this ? " " It 's not what they look like that counts . It 's what you got to offer the customers . " " What have you got to offer yours ? " The grin came back to Danny 's face . " Wait and see , boy , " he said . " Wait and see . " He lifted his hand and snapped his fingers . George , taken by surprise , ducked and turned . He saw Mike Junior , whose presence he had forgotten , drop the curtain and come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been when he opened the door for George . Mike obviously could n't move more quickly . He could try , however . That was even more obvious . All you had to do was look at his face . George , looking at it , wished he had n't . Mike Junior , straining to respond swiftly to Danny 's signal , reminded him of a dog trying to please its master , not to earn a pat but to avoid a kick . " Get Mr. Hurst a drink , " Danny said . " Okay , " Mike said . " Okay what ? " " Okay , sir . " " I told you to watch that in front of the customers . We 're trying to get a little class into the joint . " " Yes , sir . " Mike moved away toward the bar . Watching him go , Danny 's lips twisted in the small , tight smile George had known since he was three . " All these years I been keeping him in booze , I finally figured out a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at ? " " The piano player , " George said . " I just recognized her . " Danny seemed pleased by the statement . It was as though , by recognizing Mrs. Gerrity , George had recognized at the same time some talent of Danny 's of which he was proud but that had hitherto escaped George 's notice . " She 's not much good to the Yankee outfield , but she can still 231 move her hands . All these years I been pouring medicines into her , I finally figured out a way to get some of it back from her , too . Try this one , boy . " Danny pulled out a chair from one of the empty tables . George sat down . Danny took the chair facing him . Mike brought a glass and set it in front of George . " Would you like one , too ? " he said to Danny and , after a slight pause , he added , " Sir ? " " No , " Danny said . " Keep up the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your spare time . " George hoped Mike would n't laugh . He did n't . Not exactly . He merely tried . Which made it worse . Before it became unbearable , however , he went back to the bar . George moved the glass in a small circle on the painted table top . " What is it ? " he said . Danny grinned . " Imported Scotch . " " No , I mean no kidding . " " These clucks in here are paying a buck a shot for it . You call that kidding ? " " I 'd still like to know what it is before I put it in my stomach . " " It 's the same stuff I used to lug down to the barges for Mike Senior when Prohibition first came in . Go ahead , try it . It 's no worse than the crappy Passover wine you and Aunt Tessic used to make . " George took a sip . Danny was wrong . It was a great deal worse . George set down his glass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they come from ? " He knew damn well they had n't come off the lumber barges or the coal wagons . " Uptown , " Danny said . " First Avenue , Second Avenue , some from around Third . Mostly Polacks . Ca n't you tell by their kissers ? I used to deliver to them for Mike Senior . After Mike got himself knocked off , I tried to hold onto their business , but the son of a bitches , they figured with Mike out of the way they did n't have to pay . They 'd take the stuff when I delivered , but when it came to handing over the dough , they 'd say next time , kid , and pretty soon with most of them there was n't any next time . That 's what put me in that God-damn L. L. Parker mailroom laughing my head off at Shumacher 's jokes for twelve bucks a week . " Danny paused , and he looked grimly around the room , moving his head slowly from table to table , and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l 232 1 " All these years I 've been sorting that lousy mail and laughing at those crummy jokes I 've been kicking my brain around , trying to figure a way to get back at these bastards . " Danny paused again and he laughed quietly . " I finally figured it , " he said . " I started droppingin on these shmohawks after work , sort of renewing old friendships , telling them what I was cooking up , and inviting them to the opening night . I could have used a couple dozen more for an opening night , but what the hell , all I want is to get started . These boobs go away satisfied tonight , they 'll bring their buddies , and the buddies they 'll bring other buddies . At a buck a shot , it wo n't be long before I 've got back from these bastards every dime they held out on me after Mike kicked off , and then if you want to hear something real good , you stick around and listen the day I tell Eff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For a few moments , as Danny contemplated that happy day in the near future , George could feel the glow that used to remind him of Aunt Tessie 's stove on a bad winter day . Feeling himself drawn as always to the glow , George this time felt something new : a twinge of jealousy . Why should Danny have so much of it ? Why should everything be so easy for him ? Why was n't it spread around a little ? Why , to put it bluntly , when it was being handed out , did n't George Hurst get some of it handed to him ? " Danny , " he said . " What 's Ida Dienst got to do with all this ? " Danny brought his smile back from the day when he would be telling Mr. Shumacher what he could do with his job and dropped it to his wrist watch . Danny looked up , still smiling . " You want to do me a favor ? " " Could n't I first have an answer to my question ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . " " Okay , " George said . " Hop across the street to the doll store and come back with Ida , " Danny said . " She 'll be waiting for me to come and get her . " George hesitated . He did n't like Ida Dienst and she did n't like him . " Could n't you just answer my question without making me take a workout ? " " Go ahead , " Danny said . " She wo n't bite . I got her trained . " George shrugged and stood up . " Whatever you say . " " Do n't come in the side door , " Danny said . " Come in the front . " He nodded toward the door near the piano . " I 'll meet you out there in the hall . " JI 233 1 " Okay , " George said . Danny snapped his fingers . Mike Junior came out from behind the bar , crossed the room in front of George , and let him out into the street through the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he . crossed to the doll store , to see lights in the front windows . George was even more surprised , when he knocked on the door , to see Frannie come running out of the back rooms . She opened the door and , for several moments , she was clearly too astounded to talk . " It 's George ! " she said finally , as though she were identifying him for an audience of slow-witted strangers . " George Hurst ! " " What are you looking at me like that for ? " he said . " I thought you were Doctor Sugarman . " " Doctor Sugarman ? " Frannie nodded . " For Ida , " she said . " For Ida ? " Frannie nodded again . " She 's sick . A little while ago , a half hour maybe , all of a sudden she got hot like fire up here , her head , and she started to vomit . Dora ran to the drug store and called Dr. Sugarman . He said he 'd come right away . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused and her fat , pleasant face creased with perplexity as she stared at the door on which the knocking that should have been done by Dr. Sugarman had , instead , produced George . " George , " she said . " What are you doing here ? " He started to explain , then remembered that his explanation would be carried into the rooms back of the store where Dora , who hated Danny , was waiting with the rest of her family for the arrival of Dr. Sugarman . It seemed best to skip the explanations . For the time being , anyway . " I hope Ida feels better , " George said quickly . " I 've got to run now . " He did , across the street to Gerrity 's front door , which opened as soon as he knocked . Danny , standing in the hall with his hand on the doorknob , stared past George , out into the street , as the expectantsmile disappeared from his face . " Ida , " Danny said , and then , sharply , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sick ? " " That 's what Frannie told me . They 're waiting for Dr. Sugarman . Frannie said right after supper Ida got  --  " 234 1 " She ca n't be sick ! " Danny did n't usually say stupid things . George looked at him more closely . All of a sudden Danny no longer looked like the guy in the commencement exercises picture who is going to win the top prize . All of a sudden Danny looked like hell . " She is , " George said . " Frannie says  --  " " Nuts to what Frannie says ! Ida ca n't be sick ! " " Why the hell not ? Anybody can be sick . Frannie says right after supper Ida got  --  " " Because she 's supposed to sing here tonight , that 's why she ca n't be sick ! Why the hell you think I been rehearsing her for weeks ? What the hell you think I been telling these slobs in there ? They should conic pay a buck a slug and watch a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot new singer ! I told them they 'd get a floor show ! " He shoved past George and disappeared into the street . The door banged shut behind him . George stood there for several moments , wondering what to do . ' then he became aware of the soft , tinkly music and he moved toward it . Ile came into the big room through the door beside the piano . Several people looked up at him . Mrs. Gerrity was not one of them . The old woman with the black shawl sat straight and stiff , her eyes fixed on the sheet music , her body motionless except for her hands . She did n't seem to be interested in what they were doing or even aware that they were doing anything . Ilcr hands seemed to be moving along the keys without any direction from her . George crossed to the table where his drink was still standing . He sat down and looked around . He could n't see any change in the room , but George could feel that there had been a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out a few minutes ago . It was as though the customers had learned somehow that the entertainmentthey had been promised , the show for which they had been waiting so patiently , had been canceled and they were trying to decide what to do about it . George did n't doubt that what they might do about it could be ugly . Maybe this room did n't look like the picture of it he had been carrying around in his head for years , but the people in it were still shkutzim . George did n't like the feeling of restlessness in the air . " Ladies and gentlemen ! " George , furtively examining a party of three tough-looking custo- 235 1mers on his right , turned toward the familiar voice . Danny had come in through the door near the piano . He was standing next to Mrs. Gerrity . He had one hand in the air , as though he were signaling to a taxi , and he was smiling at the people in the room . George had to hand it to him . Danny Schorr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look like a man who was about to announce the collapse of a plan on which he had been counting so heavily . George , who knew what Danny 's charm could do , wondered if it would be strong enough to handle this bunch of goons when they heard there would be no show . " I have already told each and every one of you in person , " Danny said , " when you arrived here tonight , what a pleasure it is to have you with us and how grateful I am for your display of confidence in coming to the opening of our little club . I have also told you that I had arranged for your pleasure and entertainment a really rare and special treat , the sort of thing that happens only once in most people 's lifetime , the opportunity to help discover a new and great star . And so , without further introduction , " Danny said as he turned toward the door beside the piano , " I want you to meet one of the biggest and brightest and greatest stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomparable  --  Miss Dora Dienstl " For quite some time , a period that could have been moments and might have been minutes , George was too stunned to put things into any sort of sequence . Later , when he tried , he was n't at all sure he succeeded . As Dora came through the door and Danny led her to the piano , George remembered wondering stupidly where she had got that red dress , and how Danny , whom she hated , had managed to get her to come across the street and take Ida 's place . George rememberedthese and a dozen other questions racing through his head in all directions , like a bag of spilled marbles . But the thing lie rememberedmost clearly , what brought those first minutes of confusionto an abrupt end , the thing he would never forget was the moment when Dora turned . She had stopped on the exact spot Danny vacated , a little to the left of Mrs. Gerrity and three or four feet in front of the piano . Between the flaming red dress and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin was chalk-white . Looking out gravely at the audience , her body turned at right angles toward the room so that her crooked arm was concealed , she waited , absolutely motion-236less , until the piano reached her opening phrase . Then , without effort , as though she were resuming a quiet conversation that had been interrupted by the roar of a passing train , Dora began to sing " Apple Blossom Time . " The song , which to George had always meant crazy Ida screaming in the summer night , suddenly seemed completely new . It was as though what he was hearing was not a song at all . The slender girl at the front of the room was telling her lover when she would come to him , using words that had never been used before , making them up as she went along , and George was suddenly remembering again the delicate pressure of the sharp little shoulder blades under his outspread palm and the fresh honey-cake smell of the blue-black hair . The lump of loneliness , which months ago he had managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making it difficult for him to breathe , and he was wondering stupidly why he had never before noticed how beautiful Dora was , when he saw it happen . Easily , in a smooth flow of movement , like a doll mounted on a pivot , Dora began to turn toward the people in the room . George , who did not yet understand what was happening , understood clearly that it was crucial . When she finally stood full-face to the audience , and her arms came up slowly with the final bars of the song , George had a moment of shock . This was not the girl who had come into the room a few minutes ago . Dora seemed to have changed completely . Then , as her outspread arms seemed to lift the long sweet final note and hold it aloft , George understood what had happened . Dora 's left arm , like her right , looked perfectly straight . She had not changed . Dora had merely come out at last from behind the invisible wall she had built around herself all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14There were times , during the weeks that followed , when George found himself wishing she had not come out so far . Now that he knew he loved her , and in his desperate awkwardness was hunting ways to tell Dora how he felt , there were all at once 237 lvery few opportunities . George , who for years had been the only person with whom Dora Dienst would go out for a walk , suddenly could n't seem to arrange to be alone with her . He even had to wait until the morning after Dora made her first astonishing appearance in front of an audience before he could learn how it had come about . He cornered Danny in the L. L. Parker washroom and asked him . " Search me , " Danny said with a grin . " I was just as surprised as you were . When I sent you across the street to get Ida , and you came back and said she was sick , I was so God-damn mad , all those Polacks in there waiting for a floor show , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , I thought maybe Ida was stalling . Stage fright or something like that , the last minute . You know how broads are . I figured I 'd bawl hell out of her , give her a pep talk , something like that , anything to get her on her feet . Or if that did n't work , believe me , kid , the way I felt , I 'd 've dragged her back across the street by the hair . The minute I walked in that doll store , though , I knew I was cooked . Sugarman was there , poking thermometers into her from both ends , and Mr. and Mrs. Dienst and that pig Frannie , they had looks on their squashes from here to here . You could see everybody was already figuring in their heads how much the funeral would set them back . All the attention they gave me , I could 've been another couple of square feet of oilcloth on the floor , so I turned around and started to walk out , figuring what the hell does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the store when I see Dora standing there by the door , waiting for me . Jesus , I thought , that 's all I need . On top of everything else , this tomato , the way she hates me , she sees I 'm in a real deep hole , all I need is to have her come along and pee on me . Just open your yap , I thought to myself , you just let me hear even the beginning of a razzberry out of you , you gimpy bitch , I thought , and I 'll let you have it right in the teeth . I was n't kidding , either . The way I felt that minute , I 'd 've given her a shot in the mouth if she had two crippled arms , not one . Matter of fact , I was all ready to let her have it just for the hell of it , when I reach the door and instead of a razzberry Dora asks me if she could go across with me and sing instead of Ida . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like I 'm talking to you now . Let her come sing instead of Ida , she says , and just in case there 's any chance for a mistake about how she 's asking , she says please . " It takes me a few seconds to sort of shift my gears , from wanting 238 lto belt her one , I mean , and then I figure she 's kidding . But hell no . Kidding ? She starts begging ! First I think she 's gone off her rocker a little , and I say since when did you become a singer ? You ca n't sing . But she says she can sing better than Ida , which between me and you , you do n't have to be very good to be able to do because this dog Ida , Jesus , she stinks on ice and when you take her off the ice the ice stinks , but she 's so crazy to get to be a singer , and what the hell , she was doing it for free , and besides , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog like Ida Dienst is too good for those son of a bitches . " So I take another look at Dora , and one thing I have to admit right away , when it comes to looks she 's got it over that sister of hers like a tent , so I said you ca n't sing in front of people in a night club in a dirty old smock you got it all gooked up with glue and hunks of doll hair . That 's a night club I 'm trying to start across the street there , I said , not a home for beat-up old sewer workers . So you know what she does ? Right there in the store , right by that front door , she peels off that smock , and underneath , what she 's got on underneath , she 's wearing Ida 's red dress ! The one Ida made for herself to wear at the opening ! Can you beat that ? Her own sister , she 's out there on her can in bed , flat , the doctor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ croak or something , and this Dora , she 's already copped her dress ! A dame that can do that , I figure , a dame like that , I say to myself , you take a chance on , boy . Besides , what else could I do ? Marilyn Miller and Ruth Etting and Helen Morgan , those broads , they were n't exactly standing outside breaking down the door screaming take me . It was either take Dora or go back across the street and face those Polacks with nothing , so I took Dora . " Danny laughed . " Like they say , the rest is history , because you were there . " George , who had no way of knowing at that time what Danny had in mind for Dora , sensed in his friend 's laugh a complication of the problem with which he had been wrestling since the night before : how was he going to tell Dora what he had learned about his feelings for her ? " What about Ida ? " George said . " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got , it ca n't last forever . A few days , a week , whenever she gets better , she 'll still want to come across the street and sing , wo n't she ? " 239 l " In my place it 's what I want not what anybody else wants that goes up on the scoreboard , " Danny said . He looked thoughtfully at the wad of paper towels with which he had been blotting his hands dry . " You know , it 's funny , " Danny said in a tone of wonder . " She 's been right there . Dora , I mean . All these years since that lousy accident she 's been right there , across the street , in that God-damn doll store , shmecring glue and combing hair and  --  " Danny paused , leaving the tone of wonder high in the air , and then suddenly , as though he had finally removed the wrappings from a wonderful present about which when it was handed to him he had been suspicious , he smiled at George and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't it ? " It was and it was n't . It was like old times to have Dora talking to Danny , and Danny including Dora in his plans , and both of them telling George all about it . The old triumvirate was back in business . It was not at all like old times , however , for George to feel left out of those plans . The first Sunday after the opening of Danny 's club , when George walked down to the river for his regular weekly visit , he was told by Mrs. Dienst that Dora was across the street in Gerrity 's . " What 's she doing there ? " George said . It was eleven o'clock in the morning . " Practicing , " Mrs. Dienst said . It had not occurred to George that Dora would need or want to practice . " When will she be back ? " " Who knows ? " Mrs. Dienst said . " Why do n't you go over and take a look ? She 'll be glad to see you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when George knocked , was opened by Mike Junior . " What do you want ? " he said . George told him . " Wait , " Mike said . He closed the door . A couple of minutes later , when he reopened it , he said , " Danny says no visitors during rehearsal . " George felt his stomach tighten with annoyance . " What does Dora say ? " he said . Mike Junior 's gray , spotted , puffy face did not change . The dead , watery blue , egg-white eyes reflected neither comprehensionnor interest . " Miss Dienst , " George said irritably . " The girl who 's rehearsing . Go back and ask her if I can come in and listen . " Mike closed the door again . A minute later he pulled it **28;470;TOOLONG , a charmer , "  --  that 's what he called her to tease her , a charmer . " You 'll need a friend among those , those , those jackals . " He grinned and rubbed his hand against the wool of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beavers and woodchucks . And as for the jackals , they 're really hyenas . But we 're on their side . We 'll be working regularly and steadily with them , so better learn to laugh with the hyenas , eh Laura ? " ' these were the good moments ! They stood on the porch , greater than themselves because together . Since it was their common will , why could n't they stand together wherever they needed each other ? Because it had not always been that way , and could not perfectly be now . He was delighted by her joining him . Just as death and depression are an old contagion , so the health of laughter and pleasure in the gift of a rich day quickly infected him . Laura was a beauty when she wanted to be ! All the way down to her ankles and up to her intentions . He suddenly felt on his chest under his shirt a sense of something heavily tickling over him  --  her small breasts , hot and long-nippled with excitement  --  and he blinked and shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was cool , ready , smiling , his social Laura . This urgent confusion of a lover 's insatiable imaginationwould fire up his dealings with the Committee . Laura and he together were ready to use these energies for another campaign . From the porch as they looked in , Fred McKinley 's house seemed to have had the contents of a secondhand store spilled into it  --  not an antique shop , but one of those places which announce their being open for business by putting a mildewed steamer trunk on the sidewalk near the door . But it was house-used and house-familiar , sun-faded rugs , overstuffed chairs with the lumps of elbows and feet undisguised , the tables with great glass lamp and shade with the cellophane still on it , seashell souvenir ashtrays , photographs of a boy in " the service , " even the framed thoughts of Ben Franklinon Frugality . Laura could name the disease of Great Lakes taste which put each object in its preordained place . For Burr Fuller ,  |p201however  , this room meant comfort , this meant home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he officially admired ; but of course he did not admit it to Laura , because she really did mean it about the tubing . " Okay , ready ? " he asked Laura . The ardent talkers inside had not heard the creak of their footsteps on the wooden porch . She touched him back without a word . Her lips were slightly parted . She was interested . Burr rang . " Oh , so glad you could come . Do you remember me ? I 'm Rose McKinley . " " Of course I remember you . We met at  --  Mrs. McKinley , this is my wife , Laura . " A pause and buzz of politeness . The small group stood up to be introduced . Most of them had met Burr , at least casually , in dining rooms , in offices , in elevators downtown , but they did not know Laura . There were the dubious wrinklings of adjustment in the faces of busy men abruptly confronted by a lovely woman . Ed McKinley , a plump man , was working hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belt as if to appeal to it . The buckle squeaked . There were glances toward Laura and Burr and back , the judging looks of men who , recovering , lived as always by their estimates of others . On the coffee table were cups , glasses , and open bottles of good Scotch and Canadian , which  --  like the black Cadillacs parked down the street  --  helped the people in these modest middle-class houses come to calm and statesmanlike judgmentsin 1956 . They lived , of course , just like folks . McKinley , chief of the folks here , took over rapidly . " Burr , these are some good people , good friends , uh good Democrats I want you to get to know . They like you already from what I 've uh told them , and now it 's up to you to get to like them . I do n't have to kid you that the party is just shopping around  --  no , we 're interested in uh you . We 're looking and I hope we 're uh buying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how I stay where I am these days.  |p202Lausche  in Cleveland for instance had trouble . Even De Sapio . But put it straight , it 's the way I been playing it since the reform campaign of  --  never mind the year . I would n't want that pretty little wife of yours to know how uh old I am , haha . " He had the eloquence of the practiced speaker in living rooms and close conferences , and that little hesitation , that uh , whether it was the debris of a childish bad conscience or merely the gropingof a man whose mind was not necessarily on what he was saying , did not interfere with the bland intensity of his little speech . It helped to disarm his hearers . He was just uh folks . " You 're going to think of all of us as fathers to you . You 're goingto be our son , I hope  --  the best uh son a father can have . A Democratic fighter . " The group was watchfully studying both Burr and Laura . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Laura and Burr received a bit of information which he should have guessed long ago : He was Fred McKinley 's pet idea , and McKinley was having trouble jamming him down the craws of these people . It was not at all settled yet . There was sweat on McKinley 's cheeks , chins , and little diamonds of it on the broad . flanges of his nose . He labored to rub a spark among them , introducing each committeemanwith a flourish of will expressed tinder the spoken words : Like him ! Do ! or Do n't like him , but do what I say . " This is MarthaFurness , who has labored long among the ladies of our district . Of course , she ai n't won an election yet , but she has developed a little core among our Democratic voters which ... " Mrs. Furness made a sour little smile , and went back to her knitting . McKinley 's remark about not yet winning an election was very cool , very definite . He was saying : you 've got to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got nothing that can win , so why not ? On McKinley 's cheek the blue of nascent beard and the diamond prickle of sweat made a lovely rough texture . Laura was looking at it with wonder and admiration . " Martha , " McKinley was saying ,  | " has been very interested in getting to know you better , Burr . He 's even handsomer than I said , eh Mother ? " Mrs. Furness broke a thread with her teeth and nodded without looking up . Burr began to realize that he would have to roll up his sleeves ( which meant , here , turn on the charm ) and fight them for the nomination this evening . They did n't yet want to give it to him . They had deserving hacks who would love to lose for the glory of having once been the Party 's nominee  --  who could make their contacts , go to Washington , live first the strenuous life of political virtue , then the pleasanter one of a lobbyist or functionary , and blame their halted careers on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a district which was sewed up by the other side . " And this is Mr. Alexander from the Volunteers for Stevenson , or is it the Young People for Stevenson ? Or the Veterans for Stevenson , Naha . " McKinley was saying in about six ways that Burr could count that he did not like Mr. Alexander ( no first name , no memory for his organization , offhand pointing , the laugh , and the way he spun on his leather heels to look at the next man ) . Mr. Alexander was a serious , intense little man , preoccupied and scrawnily healthy  --  a high school teacher , a premature grandfatherin a pale gray suit with wide lapels , with hair the color of the suit . Burr had to watch out for him . He would approve of Burr and Burr could like him , but that did n't mean they could do much for each other . In business and politics , your friends must not be your only friends . " Stanley Alexander , " the man said stubbornly . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had a thread-cut on her finger . She put her finger in her mouth and for an instant looked like a girl . Then she made a face at Mr. Alexander , as if it were his fault . Obviously , in some mysterious way it was . She was ap204professional and did n't care for Volunteers interfering with the democratic process . " I 'm glad to meet you , Mr. Fuller , " said Stanley Alexander . " We 'll do our best for you if you receive the nomination . I 've heard good things about your point of view . " Burr nodded and smiled ( not too much for Alexander , was it ? ) and turned with McKinley to the next man . " Sam Flinn is just a friend "  --  which meant , in McKinley 's highly formal rhetoric , that he was more important than McKinley wanted to admit . " Sam 's the business agent for the Teamsters ' local hereabouts , but he has good contact with the UAW , too . Sam is one of the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinned , shrugged , and decided to leave it for another time . " Sam is one of the best friends I have , irregardless of party affiliation . " Flinn , a battered round little man in a greasy double-breasted suit , smiled through tight lips and looked like a Central European bureaucrat in a movie . He bobbed his head quickly and touched his forehead in a hat-tipping greeting . ImpulsivelyBurr decided that Sam Flinn was one of the stubborn honest men in a bad union , and that he could be on Sam 's side . Okay for Flinn ; they would make out  --  he liked his hard , humorous , and angry fat . " And last but not least  --  1 want you to meet the ladies just informally  --  here is Harold Michalski , you know Harold , do n't you ? Hal , Michalski and Sons , the contracting firm . He 's our hope in this district , boy  --  and we do have a hope . Let 's catch that idea right away . We do . Lots of his people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , like everybody is , they 're moving in on the edges of the district . Harold here , Hal , he 's loyal to us and he has them in his pocket , though you know the trouble now . The danger . They 've always voted Democratic in Hamtramck , but they start to get ideas when they move up . When they move out . Well , that 's up to Harold and us to hold on to them . Hal , I mean . " ObviouslyMcKinley was not sure of his Hal . He did not exactlyp205wheedle , but his Hal made him sweat . He looked like a schoolboy asking to carry bricks for the great rich contractor . At last Michalskigave him a twitch of smile . A soft red-faced man , Michalski sank deeper into his chair and his chins , approving of a bloc of voters being labeled " his people . " They had been his father 's before him . He made phlegmy noises of welcome and pulled at the wrinkled chicken-stubble about his chin . lie was drinking steadily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly malevolent as the introductions went on . Burr knew he was important ; a candidate must like who can help ; but he knew that this effort would cost him something and that even so it might be impossible . He might pay the cost and still fail . Laura could be nice to Michalski for him . That could be one of her jobs . She did n't mind being nice to men , even to men like Michalski . He was , after all , a man . " And that 's about it , " McKinley was saying , " except for the lovely ladies  --  we ca n't forget them , but this is business and we want to get ourselves straight . " It was as if the women were part of the office staff . Introducing them could wait , although Burr stubbornly presented his wife . McKinley looked into everyone 's eyes with pride . He showed his gold crowns when he smiled , and he smiled almost always . What he seemed to like best was that this disparate group could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like God in a mechanical universe . McKinley sighed and said , " Will you have something ? On the rocks or with soda ? Cause , boy , our friends here want to talk  --  relax  --  get to know you , boy . " Burr guessed that he had better have a drink . Ile sat with it on the arm of the heavy chair in which Laura sat , her long legs crossed , ankles smooth and set where they could be noticed . Burr leaned forward earnestly , athletically perched , very conscious of the handsome-young-couple photograph Laura and he would make on the little cards left in mailboxes . Unbeatable with Mark andp206Dan . Therein lay a danger , too , of course . He did n't want to do The Richard Nixon Story in Detroit . Plus the Life Magazine " Young Burr Fuller Runs for Congress " layout , made into a movie with Jimmy Stewart shaved at the sideburns and made up to look like thirty-three . A branch was moving against the window , crushingcrisp spring leaves . Burr felt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into summer . But an improbability of liking Michalski , that all Laura 's responsibility , Burr was also deciding . Entirely . That man does n't have tired blood . He sleeps with hot money between his legs to keep him warm . " Now , " said McKinley , " you other fellas got any questions for Mister Fuller , I mean Burr , we all got to get in the habit of being friendly ? Not just me . ' What about you , Stanley ? You 're the big lecturer among us . " Stanley Alexander , the high school teacher from the Volunteers , used to recognition from the floor , reacted to this invitation with a little habitual jerk of his knees , the pavlovian reflex of the **30;500;TOOLONG . He fought back the impulse to stand up , however . " Yes , Mister McKinley , Fred , " he said . And he pointed a sudden accusing finger at Burr : " You in favor of a liberal foreign policy ? " The finger wavered , tentative . The nail was pink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Burr . " I do n't even have to look at Fred here to answer it , either . But the real question , as I see it , Stanley , is how you define  --  " " Enough , enough ! " McKinley interrupted . " Lots of others got questions , and we have some coffee waiting for us , come time we finish the discussion . Mrs. McKinley , Rose , she made the coffee . Sam ? You want to say something ? " Burr glanced at Stanley Alexander . Stanley had the look of a totally satisfied man , metaphysically satisfied , too , well answered , not merely delighted by the coffee coming . He probably foundp207coffee all the time in his peaceful moments in the teachers ' lounge , but this would be meaningful , significant , political coffee . This would be coffee that went Someplace  --  not merely into the kidneys . " We 're not ready yet , Barbara , " McKinley said , " but come on out and meet the folks . My daughter . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I was reading . I 'll come out when you want to serve . " Sam Flinn , looking avidly at the girl , lit a cigar as if to hide his feeling . He was too polite to do nothing but stare , so he both lit a cigar and stared . She stood so lightly in the archway between parlor and other rooms that her feet seemed not to touch the floor . She belonged elsewhere . " I 'm ready when you are , Dad . " But she was smiling , teasing , not at all obedient , and she came out with false demureness while Fred McKinley introduced her . " She 's out of college now , but she does n't want a good job in politics . Just out of the goodness of her heart , her good McKinley heart I say , she 's going to work for the Party during this campaign , and then she says she 's going to New York to get a job . Can you beat that ? My only daughter ? New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I 'm going to win this campaign for you , Dad , " Barbara McKinley said . " Do you think you should complain ? " " And she will , she will ! " McKinley exclaimed with the desperate pride of a father in his lovely only daughter , a slender , nervous , very pretty girl with long black hair and very pale , almost blue skin , and quick changes of expression . Nervous , gay , subtle , unlucky in love  --  and sure to be lost to her father soon . Directly she put out her hand to Burr . It was long , light , and cool in his . Out of his gear , he turned to glance at Laura in order to see if that intuition of hers had caught him thinking deeply on Barbara McKinley , considering if , if . . . Studiously she was chattingwith Michalski . Yes , she had caught him.  |p208Without  another word about it , Barbara joined the group , perching alertly in a chair , smiling quickly and not saying why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serve the midnight coffee . Martha Furness licked her dry lips , let her sewing fall , and waited . Stanley Alexander rubbed his dry hands together in a wishing gesture , wringing thoughtfully . He was thirsty  --  he would take lots of sugar . Burr had a new task . It was to avoid speaking with Barbara without letting her know why . It was to stay away from her without giving Laura the chance to say : Guilty conscience ! He was wondering if this time Laura was right . The girl made such an alert , joyous , amused study of them all ! He rose to challenge as he had to the fraternity back in college ; she was a challenge like this evening , like the campaign . But that was only the beginning , the challenge part . There is also winning . Sam Flinn was growling to himself . He was a heavily muscled man , slow-moving , slow-talking , with tiny deepset blue eyes and the born leader 's way of gathering interest to himself , and not instantly , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to earn it . His words were as beautiful as song , it seemed , while as prosaic as a weekly shopping newspaper : " What about Taft-Hartley , boy ? What about the business of injunctions ? Will you spell it out in every speech you make ? What about the attitude toward labor and labor 's halls . . . ? " " Well , Mr. Flinn , " Burr said , " this is a middle and upper-class neighborhood . You know as well as I do . I 'll be honest with you . I 'll tell my stand  --  it 's yours , I think I 'm with you most of the way  --  but there 's no point in making them gag on it  --  " " Most of the way , " Flinn said . Ile fixed him with the cold determinationof his tiny blue eyes . They looked like thumbtacks in the flesh of his face . " That 's something we need to discuss , that most of the way , ' Mr. Fuller . But if you really are with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken , too  --  you wo n't bep209chicken . You 're not going to win Mrs. Grant 's people anyway . You might as well stand up and say what you are , say who you are  --  I do n't want to make a speech . It 's like this : the people who will worry already have Mrs. Grant . They 've got her . You 've got to get my people , coming in at the edges , and Michalski 's , and the people with our kind of consciences squeezing into the district . Did I say our kind of conscience ? I mean our kind of pocketbooks . " " But if I scare the rest of them , Mr. Flinn  --  the ones who never get laid off  --  there 's no point in scaring them , is there ? These middle-class voters  --  " Burr was wondering which Cadillac in the street outside was Sam Flinn 's . This spokesman for the insecure working people sure drove a Cadillac presented hint by his local . All right , so labor is a business , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his yellowing Florida tan ? " You say things straight out , " Flinn said . " Do the people good , and more than that , do us good . You might convince some of them if you care to . Do you care to , Mr. Fuller ? And you 'll stir up our people to care . Mine and Michalski 's . Because I 'll tell you , we 're going to need that , Fuller . " Burr simply nodded his head . Flinn replied with a nod . The two nods tightened the lines between them . They seemed to mean that they understood each other , although Burr 's nod was merely a reflex , he had thought . No : he had meant it . He assented to Flinn . He liked to be surprised by people , and Flinn was an intense little nervous man within his oldtime laborskate 's fat and sloth and shiny blue suit and Cadillac paid for by the boys . Stanley Alexander made a little outward drawing twitch of his mouth and jaw . He understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his lifetime , he was excluded from it . Once more that twitch . He bent with a fast gesture of nervous courtesy , too agile for a grandfather , to pick up a needle which Martha Furness had dropped on the rug . He fell on it , stabbed his palm , peeped , " Ouch ! " He sucked the wound.  |p210Mrs  . Furness said , " Did you prick yourself ? " McKinley turned to his daughter . " In just a minute , Barbara . We can all smell the coffee . Not long . " He stood up self-consciously , rubbing his dry hands ( Burr 's were hot and damp , Alexander 's were pink ) and said : " All right . Okay . I think we 've all had our say , and what is more important , had the chance to let you have your say . We appreciate your coming  --  " Burr stood up , sensing dismissal . " I t was good of you to invite me , Fred . I think Laura and I will go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate ... " Too eager . Fred McKinley scowled and the black of jowls found a reflection in his eyes . " Stay for the coffee . But although we appreciatehaving you here , Burr , you understand that we have to shop around . We 're investing a lot of money in you , assuming you make the campaign , or whoever gets the nomination  --  almost as much as if we had hopes of winning . " Laura explained in a high rich voice , explosively : " But we 're going to win ! " There was a ripple of approving indulgent laughter . Burr had a start of pride in Laura 's confidence in him . She believed it ; she was a fighter . The break in her perfect poise was exactly the imperfectionwhich her beauty of company grace needed . " Little lady , " Fred McKinley said , grinning , refilling his glass just one more time , " little lady , that was a fine thing you just said  --  " ( Burr had the idea that at exactly this moment Laura had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't taken this district since Lincoln ran . That 's the last time they went democratic . This is I mean a stubborn Republican district . " " My wife speaks for me , " Burr said , smiling . There was general applause . Barbara McKinley stood beside her father and turnedp211her dazzling nervous smile on Burr . Stanley Alexander decided to stop bleeding and return to politics . Even Martha Furness smiled . She could sometimes be delighted by a dropstitch , coffee , and Burr Fuller . Michalski creaked . He was moving in his chair . BarbaraMcKinley tapped her heel and , for one sad instant , Burr thought she was impatient for him to leave . Then no  --  just energy she could n't use . She had the straight high gleeful air of the girl who knows she pleases : Burr took note . The girl who knows she pleases likes most of all to have it proved . " Have your coffee before you leave , " she said . " You have a baby sitter , do n't you ? " Strong black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thought , and did not care if caffeine kept them up all night afterward . They gossiped about the Washington people and covertly watched Laura and Burr . These two did not talk with each other ; without a signal , without a plan , they talked to the others , Michalski , McKinley , Flinn , Alexander , Furness . They worked on the electorate . They leaned and listened . They frowned and smiled and were thoughtful . When it was time for good-bys , Burr believed that the Committee was primed . He understood that they wanted to stay behind and discuss him , measure him , figure him out as a group . McKinley , that good clever man , would complete the disarming of his colleagues by expressing a sense of worry and doubt  --  he would make them decide . Burr shook hands with each of them , and with Barbara . " If we decide , " Fred assured him at the door , " you wo n't have to worry about the primary . Just concentrate on November . I 'll call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too quickly , eager to get to deciding business , but Burr knew that he had the nomination ! IIe had it ! He squeezed Laura 's hand : you did it ! Perhaps that was not entirelytrue , but in a moment of pleasure , a moment of triumph , he always turned to her to insist : You 're with me , Laura , now let'sp212cut up the evening together ! " We made it , I think , " he said quietly in the car . Laura pressed his arm and sat thinking . He could hardly bear her silence , lie wanted what came next . He opened the window to let the chill spring wind flow through . Even the heavy greasy wet of spring slush felt good , and the cool darkness , the tension flowing away in a stream of silence . His clothes were soaked with sweat ; in his intense battle for ease  --  attention , smiles , nods , agreements , words  --  nothing had been taken for granted by his body . To be nice is hard ! But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laura and he would decide about each of the committee  --  Michalskiwho stared at her , McKinley , Furness , Alexander , and Flinn . Burr wanted Flinn to know that they could count on each other . Laura said , " I 'll tell you something , Burr . They had it decidedbefore we came . But they wanted to watch you wiggle . " " Us . " " Maybe . But they saw that you can fight , Burr . " " I did n't make any speeches . I hardly talked . " " But you stood up to them , you looked at them the way they have to be looked at . Look  --  that 's what they wanted . Right now they are congratulating themselves for digging you up . " Burr began to laugh with intense relief . He felt the laughter shaking up from his belly and chest as if it meant more than what they were talking about . What had he feared from Laura ? He turned from that line of thought ( stop it ! do n't spoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ? They had to dig me up ? I 've been throwing the sod in their faces ever since I got out of law school . Lady , wife o ' mine , I 've been working for this ! And we got it quick ! And we 'll beat Mrs. Grant , too ! " She slid across the seat toward him as he headed down the ramp onto the expressway . " That 's why you grit your teeth in your sleep sometimes ? " she asked . " Yes , maybe , " he said . He felt challenged : like the times whenp213Laura returned angry from her analysis to tell him how responsible he was for this , for that  --  he did n't mind responsibility , but her anger was very hard . But she was finely with him tonight , and cuddled like a college girl by his side , her hand on his knee . " You were fine . They tried all ways of looking at you and you looked as pure as an angel with wings right back at them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who you are . Though you are certainly no angel , Burr of mine . " He smiled and patted her arm as he drove and felt as embarrassedas if he had been flattered by the teacher before the class . " Hey , you 're talking about a candidate for Congress from the Thirty-Fourth , not the Emperor of Cloudland . " " That will come , " she said , and for the second time of the evening she gave him that wonderful blessing of her laughter . Laura too was engaged in an effort . But before the laughter could fade , she snapped it off hard and seemed , as she often did , to change stations abruptly . " But I ought to tell you something , Burr . The way you looked at McKinley 's daughter  --  " Barbara , Burr thought inconsequentially . Now he understood his laughter and his too early ease . " I do n't say you meant anything by it , I 'm sure she 's a nice girl , but you have to be careful now . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " When I get elected I 'll pass a law to prevent people from gossiping , okay ? That settle it ? " " I trust you , Burr , but just a little  --  just a little , Burr  --  you hurt my feelings when you look at her like that . Please . " Still proud and sure after a victorious evening , and a victory with Laura on his side too , he said : " And you looked at Flinn . At Michalski . " " It 's different . " " Let 's not be silly , eh ? People are always looking at people , men and women especially at women and men . But the distance be/tween looking  --  even the distance between guessing or imagining  --  it 's the important thing . I hardly said two words  --  " She was abruptly chilled and retreated . " I ca n't tell what you imagine about Barbara McKinley , Burr . Are you thinking about her ? All I know  --  " " Who said I imagined anything ? Oh , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's the two of us be alone now . " Silence . They were alone hurtling through the thick ribboncurveof expressway toward their home . Laura was working iiitensely , silently , fighting something within her . He tried to wait until she was done . " Laura ? " he said at last . For answer she squeezed his arm . " I 'm sorry . I 'm so guilty , anxious  --  I know I should n't be . I 'll try to stop it . Forget it  --  just congratulations , Burr . " He glanced sharply at her for a mean glint of irony . But no , she meant it : she was sorry , she was congratulatinghim on the nomination . There were no malicious connections . So he put one arm around Laura as he drove . " I 'll have to buy a necker 's knob for the wheel , " he said . His chest was congested with pride and love because she stayed with him , she trusted him , she could put her waspish stinging away and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring night surrounded them . There were beads of wet on the hood of the car , blowing and popping away , drying , as he accelerated steadily toward the huge speed of a Detroit expressway . He needed the nomination . But he did n't need Barbara McKinley if he could have Laura . BURR 'S ABILITY TO GIVE HIMSELF ENTIRELY TO THE IMportantpresent act was his salvation . Also it had the effect ofp215jerking the chair out from under his sense of time . Reality held little but this moment , this need and deed , this problem and issue when Burr was totally absorbed in his action  --  and he knew it about himself and knew how he required this rush of continuous green growth because he saw into what confusion of memory he sank when , in the midst of a television interview , he suddenly thought of Mike Murray , now dead for over ten years . " What do you think of public control of natural gas prices ? " Burr was remembering his debate with Mike about their right to sit on someoneelse 's grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the Federal Government . . . ? " Mike was not dead , of course ; once in the war , years before , for a few days Mike had been dead ; Mike was still his friend , his sad , skinny , brief-writing , lonely , bachelor friend , and working in his campaign ; but in this moment of opportunism and scheming , he wished Mike gone . Mike 's judgment was part of the ballast he carried , and he wanted to sail faster . Although he lived avidly in the present time , in the budding moment , he could not stop these spasmodic distorted glimpses from another sweeter , sadder time . Sweeter ? he thought later . Sentimental ! Was it sweet to be tormented by the frat like that ? The thought came to him that his political ambitions had something to do with the fraternity and Allen Turner . Ile still wanted to belong , but now he knew that he needed a measure of control . The inquisition and ritual of expiation organized by Allen Turner was a prediction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But of course , not every citizen needed to become a congressman , any more than every college student needed to prove his strength in relation to a fraternity . Some could just leave well enough alone . Like Mike . Or judge . Like Mike . Some delegated their powers in a way that Burr never could , except about love  --  there , yes , he delegated grace and beauty to Lauer and needed her to complete him.  |p216And  so he spoke at meetings , all sizes and shapes of meetings , little pear-shaped ones and great hallfuls , the Lions Club , the PublicLibrary Better Films Committee , the College Club , the Friends of Yugoslavia Association , the Workmen 's Circle , telling them , " I 'm Burr Fuller , and I need your votes . My opponent has great sums of money and great power in the media for publicity . All I have is my good strong lungs , my determination , and my faith that you will look at me and hear me and think : Let 's make the shift to Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could tell that the crowds went with him . His appeal , earnest and self-mocking and intense all at once , made them smile and attracted them . He needed them , he was saying , but they needed him , too . He could do good things for them . They had had enough of Mrs. Grant . He played on his youth ; he wore his hair tousled , and worked at it . They needed Burr Fuller  --  young , vital , veteran , hero . . . These words used by chairman began to make him want to giggle . But they were true , were n't they ? And did n't he bound to the podium , hair tousled , eyes intense , and live up to the words " young and vital " as much as he could ? And did n't he shyly , modestly , make sure that the ardent consumers of war heroes were reminded that he was a " war hero " ? He had special hair-tousling muscles . IIe had a way of indicating momentary sadness ( offshore oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice , and no one but Burr Fuller was depressed by the limits of his range : both profiteering in nationalresources and human rights employed the same number of bass vibrations . Any excessive play of his Adam 's apple on them would make his audience uneasy ; the engineer at the switchboard would have to control it . Now it was time to say : " I 'm Burr Fuller , and I need your votes . " It was important to be able to give up time and memory , these familiar definitions of self , and to live entirely in the here and now . The evenings when he was not at a meeting ,  |p217or  before he went to the meeting , or after the meeting if they were early ones , he would ring doorbells and canvass up and down the green , dully flowering springtime streets of his district . He was turned away from Mark and Dan , even though they clamoredfor him now , finding him in flight toward distant goals , tired and abstracted when he had an hour to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head : " You 'll be home late then , Burr ? " I 'm Burr Fuller , and I need your kisses . " Not too late . Give me a kiss . I ca n't walk the streets late  --  do n't want to ring a bell and wake someone up . I 'll be back soon . " " You 'll be home late then , " Laura stated . " Laura , I 'll be back as soon as I can . " " Late , then , " she repeated . If he had not been able to turn from his life , turn from the immediatepresent into the only future , he could have done nothing . He left Laura , and his husband 's heart turned and his husband 's belly dissolved in craven weakness ; she was discontented , unhappy , she was not with him . Five minutes . He backed out the garage , raced the motor , pulled around the corner , and he was singing to himself , stomach sucked in , feeling very strong and alert , streaminghigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would give him what his heart wanted . Trying to work at home one day on the tattered remnants of his law practice  --  he had practically given it up for the campaign  --  he met Laura 's stiff and frozen face every time he emerged from their bedroom to pat Mark 's head , take a drink of water , and  --  he admitted it  --  to try to find Laura with a smile for him . Her skin seemed almost green with diverted spleen . She would not say anything ; she would not give anything ; there was nothing he could do . She was furious with jealousy of the time and love he spent on the campaign . She never said that she felt Mrs. Grant was unbeatable , although many of their friends did . She would not evenp218say that she wished he could be like other men , content with a normal workday , a normal life , and feed her with the romantic image of womanhood which had been her dream during the days and nights of a college beauty . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish ; yet she felt her lack , judged and estimatedits remedy in the light of past gratifications , and desired with all her heart to be desired by a troubador prince bent only on loving her . Instead Burr left for another meeting . No , a press conference this time . " You okay , honey ? " " Sure . Everything 's the same . Children , dishes , house . . . . " " What 's the matter , honey ? Did I do something ? " Her eyes were like teeth snapping shut at him . " Of course you did n't do anything . Nothing . Go , go , you 'll be late for your re-porters . " " Well , Fred McKinley will be waiting with them , too , but  --  " " Then go . " " But I wish you would be more chipper . " She put a theatrical smile on her mouth , and for a reeling momentBurr thought  --  because he wanted it so much  --  that the smile was real . Then lie saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Happy Confident Candidate 's Wife Chipperly Smiles To Wish Him Well . Now go , hurry up , must n't keep the reporters  --  " " Honey , will you  --  " " And Fred McKinley , big bossman , waiting . " " Honey , do n't . Will you come with me to these meetings ? I wish you would . You know what a help when you do come . . . It 's wonderful for me , for both of us when you come . " She put up her cheek to be kissed . When he did not bend down , but only frowned , absent , confused , all in hat and topcoat but still waiting , she straightened up again and said , " I know it 's a big help to you , and I 'll do what I can to help you , but the childrenp219need me . After all , their father is very busy , so I have to make it up to them as much as I can . " He winced . " I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Almost every day . Sometimes there happens to be a long meeting . I 'm not complaining , the campaign will be over . Of course , then there will be another campaign , and then another , and another  --  " " Laura ! " " Go . You 'll be late . Now go . " He recognized her look of triumph . She had made a successful speech . And so he went . For most men a lifetime is divided into periods of sleep and waking , privacy and public effort , family and work ; there is an ebb and flow of experience , with steady variety and shifting backwardsand forwards into the familiar and the novel . Time is measuredby regular rhythms . Even lovemaking  --  about which a married man often forgets the next day , so that he can not remember if , if  --  falls into a pattern . This is not true of the public man , that grinding optimist who seeks to change his own life by changing the life of the nation . His devotion , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the artist  --  ferocious and absolute . The pattern disappears . Burr lived only for a public image of himself at the same time as he was intensely and brilliantly aware of what he was making of himself . He burned . One might think , therefore , that he would be fatigued , consumed ; that he would sleep the sleep of a dead man when he finallyslept , after the radio appearances , the recordings , the televisioninterviews , the speech-writing , the conferences , the struggle with opposing supporters , the hand-shaking and the constant attentionsfrom the crowds always recognizing him . No . These things for the public man are food and drink and sleep . Burr was fed and nourished and refreshed in them . After the first shock ofp220the campaign he had energies which made him feel Iike a fizzing bomb , as after a prickling icy shower , when he returned to his home , and lie rolled and tussled gleefully on the floor with his sons , and wanted his wife desperately in the early hours of the morning when the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the afternoon because he wanted her , and then went out again to a meeting , leaving her tossed limp on the bed while the boys had their nap . He loved the Detroit power surge of his automobile down the expressway on his way to meetings , where he would appear smiling and , without any conscious preparation , master of the proper joke and the right promises . His health was never better . His rose fever did not appear that year . He was proud of the crisp clarity of his sinuses . If he ran a steady slight fever , it was that of the bird who sings steadily in an excess of heat . Barbara McKinley , assigned by her father to Burr 's volunteer committee , was often present and waiting for him when he arrived at the meeting . By some agreement which had never been formulatedbetween them , they avoided coming and going together . It was as if Barbara had overheard Laura 's worrying that first time in McKinley 's parlor ; it was as if Burr agreed with Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to him only her nervous , nail-biting side . What else there was , and what occasion for the jitters , had been stated only in that first troubled stare between man and woman which leads deviously to the clasping , glittering future . This slender young woman seemed taller than she was  --  she moved with rapid grace on high heels : she seemed darker than she was  --  glossy hair and darkest eyes despite pale skin in which a vein of tension stood up ( wrist and forehead ) when a newspapermanbaited him . She seemed very sweet to him at his side . Tony Chasins , the man from the Free Press , was asking him :  | " Do you think you really have a chance , Mr. Fuller ? " And one eye winked , as if they understood each other , man to man , and why not confess to old pal Tony ? For a moment , as Burr looked at him , the face of the young reporter , serious and kidding both , shifted in his mind and became one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad , calling him silly , challenging him , and he would have to say : Probably no chance at all . But it 's worth trying anyway . And Mike would say : Why ? The crowd edged around him , eager spinsters and avid politicals trying to ask him their questions so that they could go away remembering , " I talked with Mr. Fuller for the longest time . I asked him a question , and then he turned right around and wanted to know what I thought  --  someone must have told him about me . I 'll tell you , that man knows how to pick brains . I bet he 'd know how to talk to Bernard Baruch . I 'll bet he 's a great man some-day Tony Chasins had repeated his question . There was a glint of iron in Tony 's eye when he saw how the brute question had stopped Fuller . " Mr. Fuller , " he insisted , " do you really think you have a chance ? I mean , you breathe the air of this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization . The right organization . She has n't even bothered beginning to campaign yet . She feels sure  --  " And Barbara was standing cruelly by him , saying , " Of course ! What a ridiculous question ! Burr Fuller is working like this on his campaign because he knows he can win . He will , he will win ! This community needs him . " With heavy irony , no longer Mike Murray at all , Pony Chasins asked Burr : " Is Miss McKinley answering the question for you ? May I quote her ? " " You may quote me , " Burr said . " It is my intention to go to Washington as the Representative from this district . You listen to me almost every day , Tony , or just read my literature  --  make surep222Mr . Chasins has a copy of the pamphlet , please , Miss McKinleyyou should know why I believe my election is essential . " He relievedthe embarrassed and ungrammatical pomposity of this statementby pausing . The resemblance to Mike had thrown him ; Barbara 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble in another . " Not that any single person is essential , Mr. Chasins . I do n't believe that only I can do the job . But I have some standardsand perhaps some qualities that not everyone has . Let 's say I 'm young and healthy , okay ? Let 's say that I want to get to work and have some ideas . You 're being Socratic when you ask questions  --  you know what the answers are . But feel my arm , take my blood pressure : I have the strength to fight for my ideas . " " Mrs. Grant seems rather healthy for her age . " Barbara interrupted again : " But Mr. Fuller has young ideas , too . " Completely recovered now , Burr said , " Let 's not fight it out on that basis . My children are even younger than I am . A good diaper service could supply even younger candidates . What I mean is  --  I 'm capable of working for my program , and my program is what the people of this district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy arc close to your ideas , even if not to those of your publisher . Okay ? That 's on the record , Tony , if you want to use it . " Chasins grinned . " I 'll have to leave out part of it , " he said . " I may have needled you , Burr , but I got something I can use  --  if you mean it about you and me agreeing . " Burr touched the reporter 's arm . How quickly the movie veneer of journalistic cynicism cracked ! Young Chasins assumed that Burr spoke for him without noticing that Burr had not mentioned the specific items of agreement . When the meeting was up , Burr hurried directly home . He did not say good-by to Barbara . The little vein which throbbed in her high pale forehead did not retreat . He wondered what signs shep223detected in him to match her challenging , almost angry eyes , her half-smile of sweetness and teasing , that blue vein . It would have been pleasant to have a drink with her , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein in her forehead , but lie had a guilty rush of loneliness for Laura . Barbara knew why he did not dare to speak with her , and dared even less after she had hurried to help him in the talk with Tony Chasins . Burr knew why he did not allow the easy palship with Barbara that seemed called for by their circumstances . He kept it formal , distant , and never let them be placed together alone . He buried the evidence in politeness . Laura did not know . Please God , Burr prayed , let her never guess . I still want only Laura if she can be mine . BARBARA MCKINLEY HAD AN IDEA WHICH SIIE THOUGITTmight encourage Burr just after the first hot days of the long campaign , when early enthusiasm gives way to habit and the series of days until the first Tuesday in November stretched out to the end of his life . In a time when he was barely known , when Mrs. Theophile Grant was an institution as securely located as the Masonic Temple , Burr needed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable , that he might even make it . By a process of negative persuasion , then , he needed to sec Mrs. Grant in action . Mrs. Theophile Grant was an erect old lady who admitted to being in her sixties . She had a great deal of money out of iron mines in Canada and shipyards on the West Coast ; she had a lesser but still considerable source of capital iii her rapidly appreciatingland holdings on the outskirts of Detroit ; she had a smallp224income  --  a fortune to feebler individuals , but unimportant to her  --  in her int crest in the holding company which owned one of the chief newspapers in Detroit . This latter enterprise smiled favorablyupon her political ambitions , and so was of other than purely financial usefulness . In earlier days , as the wife of Congressman Grant , she had confined her social interests to phrenology , spiritwatching , and missionary contributions . She had left it to her husband to watch over the family investments and carry the family name into the arena of politics . But when , poor man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasioned by diving into a swimming pool  --  he had thought there was water in the pool  --  Mrs. Grant decided to chuck her mediums , ectoplasms , and emissariesto Dahomey and run for the seat vacated by her husband . Both divisions of the family enterprise , spiritual salvation and economic uplift , were left to her single stewardship . The mill of God grinds slowly , but it grinds exceeding small ; and nothing is proof against divine purpose , certainly not a leaky drain that she had told and told and told him to have repaired . Well anyway , the governor nominated her . She won the succeeding elections on her own power . As to the scat in Congress , she filled it fully , overflowingly . She voted as her majority leader asked on almost every issue . She kept up her charities , and especially at election times , gave generously and without religious prejudice to all churches , to every bona fide charitable cause in her district . No one could say that she was not a pious and good old lady . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signature to every scholarship winner , Soap Box Derby contestant , and Golden Age marriage survivalin the district . There was a palsied forty-year-old girl in her office whose sole duty was to comb the newspapers for people to felicitate . Mrs. Grant was a fine and spry old lady , as wealthy believers in spiritualism often are  --  erect , blue-haired , and fresh of face , withp225an extraordinary prow of ossified bosom and a shrill power of vocal penetration when engaged in the act of speeching . In the district , her family name , her charities , her fence-mending , and her personal generosity kept the name Grant invulnerable through election after election . The party leaning of the electorate in the district had always been Republican . The Grants were an institution . And no matter how one felt about her voting record and political posture , all agreed that she had an efficient office managerin Washington . She provided a weekly newsletter to her constituents . Upon the whisper of his desire , any visitor to Washingtoncould have a guided personal tour by a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turned ont not to be from the district . She promptly answered requests , mail , demands for help or sympathy , and very often did business in Washington for those who asked in a nice way . Since hers was one of the largest office staffs in the House of Representatives , the relatively unpublicizedbut politically important services to her constituents were carried out with extraordinary dispatch . She even sent copies of a Manual of Peaceful Marriage , written by one of her spiritualist friends , to newlyweds in the district . " Love , Eternal Love  --  How to Preserve It " was the title of the first chapter . " The Perils of Needless Passion  --  How Often ? " , " Money in the Happy Home  --  How Much ? " , and " Little Voices of Your Tots  --  How Many ? " were other useful sections indicated by Mrs. Grant 's covering letter . While the power is not given to every soul to live up to the injunctions contained in the twelve worthwhile chapters of this book ( " Count to ninety-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Grant 's thoughtfulness made its mark . It was not given to many souls to forget her . She was against aid to France but for it for Lebanon . She believed in love and in never continuing an argument past bedtime . She had her secretreasons , including Aramco oil and the overheating of the sheets.  |p226Everyone  felt a space of security about the ensign and within the domains of Mrs. Thcophile Grant ; the voter was personally valued . Fixed in the heaven of money and tradition , she brooded over her district as the sun is said to brood over peaceful villages in happier clinics . ' I'hc old impulse toward submission to a hereditary seigneur has not died , even and perhaps especially in a society built on quicksand . The lively old girl took wheat germ , geriatric vitamins , molasses , sunlamp treatments , massage , sulphur baths ; drank both aquavit from joyous Scandanave and Vichy from Vichy ( no one wants to say that the individual Frenchman lacks fine personal qualities ) ; gave out little boxes of Kellogg 's All Bran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty ) ; slept like a log ; breathed deeply ; prospered . She ate chopped steak with raw eggs , patiently gumming each morsel for the last health in it . She had a hoarse and imperative note when she addressed an electioncrowd ; the crowd loved to see this aristocrat lean into the microphone and talk to them in their own language . A member of her staff , the one who wrote her speeches , spoke this language . Barbara 's idea was that Burr should attend the meeting of the Natural Childbirth Association which was to be addressed by Mrs. Grant at the Masonic Temple . " But I ca n't , I 'll be recognized , " he said . " And anyway , why ? " " First things first , then questions why , " said Barbara , smiling . True that his face was beginning to be known . IIe could not just walk into the meeting with all those earnest young couples whose babies had been born without anesthesia , whose pelvic muscles were trained to eject their progeny like candy bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstetrical table with its sterile sheets and leather stirrups . Natural Childbirth , one of the several religions not born on the shores of the Mediterranean , promises shapely heads , undrugged spirits , and a rosy intercommunicationfor those women who will train themselves and their husbands for the climactic procreative experience . Afterwards , ofp227course , they enjoy a blood kinship with other fortunate ones , and may join in a philanthropic , educational , and fraternal organizationdevoted to the ideals of Natural Childbirth and the iconographyof Dr. Grantly Dick-Read . It was this group which Mrs. Grant had been invited to address at the Masonic Temple on Thursday night . Her subject : " A Public Woman Looks at Natural Childbirth . " Barbara felt that Burr would be better armored to do battle with Mrs. Grant if he personally attended one of her meetings . She could make complete arrangements for secrecy . There was a room off the main stage used by performers as a dressing room . In the complicated maze of Fred McKinley 's friends , Barbara found a direct connection to it . Smuggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see both the crowd and the stage from a peephole built into this room for nervous wives , managers , agents . " I think Laura will be amused , too , " Barbara said . " We 'll sneak you both in through the side door , under a black velvet cloak maybe  --  . would you like that ? " Without asking Laura , Burr knew that she would not be amused by the adventure . " All right then , " Barbara said , " how about you ? " " Wonderful ! " The small-boy game of it attracted him as much as the medium-large espionage . There was another idea in it , too , which he did not for the moment admit  --  the tiny blue vein throbbing on Barbara 's forehead . " You 're on , Burr , " she answered him . He did ask Laura , however , and as he predicted , she said no . She asked why he wanted to do a furtive thing like that . ( Mike would n't . Laura would n't . ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , anyway , it did n't hurt anyone . It was not sneaky , merely funny . He was just interested , but it would embarrass everyone if he were seen . He did not mention that this was Barbara 's project and that he was picking her up at the new " Fuller for Congress " office in a vacant store on Hillberry Street . But the plan was not sneaky or furtive , no  --  Laura had had her chance to go with him . Once more she had said no ; she would stay home and Mike would drop by for a drink to keep her company . They could both wait to hear about it from him afterwards . The crowds came dripping off the gleaming nighttime streets , shaking their umbrellas , huddled together in a dense pack of wet wool and gleaming raincoats . Parking lots for a mile around were stacked with Detroit 's grinning chromium colossi . The rain fell steadily , heavily , water in the air and abruptly an oily slick on the cement , and ran hissing and whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down like lightly tapping hammersonto the sober crowd of schoolteachers , women in rimless glasses , progressive thinkers about the primitive virtues who all had this in common  --  their children , or at least the children of their friends , were sprung without anesthetic from aroused but educated pelvic arches . " Natural childbirth " was the oath of blood between them , as through a cramp damply , and they jostled each other with fierce friendliness and giggles . They had husbands , too . The husbandscame along . The little bright hammers of rain seemed to drive the men into the ground , so bent and shrunken were they all . But once inside they straightened up and became men again . They dried their ears with Kleenex . They checked their coats at the cloakroom . The whimsical lady who was introducing Mrs. Grant said , " Now we all think husbands are very important , do n't we ? They are essential , are n't they ? Essential , " she said , answering her own question , " for let 's speak seriously now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An electrician hustled Barbara and Burr in through the stage door , back among the ropes and pulleys and ranks of curtains and into the stage manager 's little lair . Iie shut the door on them beforeMrs . Grant stepped forward . They were alone , waiting , withp229only a faceless brood of natural parentage out beyond the footlights . They could see the stage more clearly . Most clearly , Burr could feel Barbara watching beside him in the darkness . They were very careful , much too careful , to avoid touching in the dark . He felt her presence as an orator feels a crowd  --  in a swelling desire to possess . Power and the yearning of power , need and the willingness to risk satisfying his need  --  all men take chances . He remembered being locked in a schoolroom with Lucille , smell of erasers and chalk and drawing hot steam from the radiators , and how at first they had not dared to touch . Lugubrious . Dangerous . The man of power must not be prisoner to memory . He felt faint all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein in Barbara 's forehead , and out of this faintness issued the desperate , deluding thought : What harm would there be ? Why not ? Just to touch once .. . Just in time , Barbara broke his dizzy gravitation toward her . " There she is , " she whispered . They stood at the peepholes side by side like prisoners at the stocks . Mrs. Theophile Grant was beginningher talk . From where they watched , she looked like an ordinary elderly lady in a flowered blue hat and firmly corseted under a black dress hung with tassels and ribbons . Her blue hair rinsed until the color of steel , she had a baby 's plump face despite her age , the tiny feeding mouth set deeply within indulgent cheeks . She planted her two feet squarely before the microphone and began talking without notes in a high-pitched energetic voice . But Burr hardly heard . He was bound into position in the darkenedroom like a prisoner at the stocks , but his sense of the slender , lavish-limbed girl standing at his side brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stool . He felt near him the slightestmovements of breathing in her body  --  felt almost without touching , felt absolutely without touching . Ile did not dare . He had drawn away . Mrs. Theophile Grant was saying : " The late Mr. Grant , Repre/sentative Grant , was very skilled at natural childbirth . He was such a good man that he had to be good at that , too . He had traveled in India and Arabia , too . He ... " Barbara was touching him ; Barbara was poking him . " Burr , Bin I ! " she was whispering into his ear . " Do n't you see ? She does n't know what natural childbirth is ! She 's talking about  --  she 's talking about something else ! " He came gradually into focus on the easeful little old lady rambling on into the microphone on stage . " ' Hie late Mr. Grant was always considerate and thoughtful of me . Ile knows that a happy wife is the most important thing in life to a man , and so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired and weary with the affairs of state . I never made demands on him , of course , and I believe that a man has to think of his wife all by himself , in his heart of hearts , but when he saw that I was nervous and tense . . . " Her voice trailed off . " I do n't believe in aspirins . I remember when I was young and had hot flashes . . . " Again she faltered before making a fresh new beginning . She honored the dead by lifting her chin and lowering her girdle . " Dignified yet peppy was the word for the late Honorable Representative Theophile Grant , I guess that 's two words , " she mused , and for a moment Burr saw the coy soft girl she must have been , in bustle and hairpiece , being chased with dignity but peppinessthrough Victorian chambers by the goateed old duff of his last photographs . She stopped to shut her eyes and dream a while . Those were surely the two words for him . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what only great orators and cocaine derivativeshave  --  the power to stop coughing by both tickling and stunning the brain . She was more on the side of the opiates , Burr decided . But she was at home with herself ; her ideas would come . Theideas came , garden warm , easy , and not tinkered with by her staff . " Oh , the late Representative Grant was a gifted man ! He hadinherited great wealth , so he could devote himself to humanity . Hep231loved bird-watching , particularly the little robins redbreast , who taught him to make love . I recommend ornithology to all you young husbands out there . " She waved to the young husbands out there by raising her plump hand , opening it , and closing it twice . " He was so good at it . The late Representative Grant told me how the hen robin keeps love alive after marriage . The cock robin feeds her ! He feeds her ! She may even stand among a pile of tasty worms , but she ruffles her feathers and cries out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worm ! ' she seems to peep . ' Peep ! ' she cries . Just one more yummy little worm ! ' And with such tendernesshe drops the wormlet into her waiting bill ! " She lifted her corsage by taking a breath . Her sigh could have drawn in the shades across the hall . She said , " And that 's how the late Representative Grant dealt with me , with the result that we had five fine children and a carefree happy home until the day he died , serving you the people of this district , just as I do today . But as the years fly by and my hair turns gray "  --  touching the blue aura about her head as if to say , Fat chance  --  " and all this world 's struggle , toil , trouble , and loopdedoo fade into distant memory , I shall always remember the hen robin and the cock robin , dear friends , and I hope you do , too . " She sat down abruptly and gulped from a glass of water . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass between her lips . For a moment there was an astonished silence in the hall  --  the gatheredyoung couples had expected they knew not what , but something else  --  and then ( such was the dignity , wealth , and position of the lady ) they applauded . Such was the seriousness of this occasionwhich required the mobilization of thousands of baby sitters and their weapons of popcorn , Vernor 's ginger ale , comicbooks , instructions of whom to telephone in case of emergency . Bluehaired , baby-faced despite her age , dressed in a flowered hat and a flowered dress , Mrs. Grant stood up and acknowledged the applauselike the veteran politician she was . She lifted her hand forp232one final climactic word , and in a high-pitched voice she admonishedthe audience , shaking a finger at them : " Do n't forget the hen robin , friends ! Never forget the cock robin ! " In a fury of elation in the dark , Burr turned on Barbara McKinley . " Oh , my God , we can make something of that ! Cock Robin and lien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The woman is crazy or senile ! " " Yes , " Barbara said , turning with her hands on his arms to disengageherself . He had thrown his arms about her without thinking ; only in this congratulatory fervor could he do it for the first time . He kept his arms where they were and made her pry loose the fingers pressing into her flesh . " Yes , but look at them . They love her , " Barbara said . " Love her ? " It was true . The crowd was standing and applauding . They understood the solidity she looked like , the dignity she represented , not what she had said . Her confusion meant nothing beside the great aura of wealth , position , and blue-rinsed hair . For this crowd she had magnitude , and they might smile at her , shake their heads over her , but then vote with her . They did n't care about intellect or program . Mrs. Theophile Grant was a great installation if not a great lady , and the applause was real . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freckled arms in a prizefighter 's gesture of victory . America , America ! Burr thought . The dignity type kick , plus pep . But when we finish putting this doll 's speech on the record , Burr decided , they wo n't be so purely charmed . Cock Robin and Hen Robin ! Plenty of witnesses if there is any doubt . . . . ( I am functioning very well in politics despite Barbara at my side . I can carry two ideas . I can do anything ! But where else did I hear a story about love and worms , Cock Robin ? ) Burr and Barbara put their heads back to the peepholes in the wall . Every-which-way confusion of the end of a meeting . There was no reason to watch ; their own confusion occupied them fully ,  |p233and  their eyes were vacant upon the hall , and this was their reason . They stood like prisoners immobile in the stocks , leaning into vacant space . Burr felt her warmth catching along the whole side of his body , her face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned against each other , looking . When had he let her go ? Why had he taken her in his arms ? The wall against which he leaned seemed heated by Barbara 's body . Abruptly he pulled away , terrified , saying , " I 've had enough ! Let me take you home . " " Let you ? " she said , smiling , and held his arm through the darknessuntil they reached the ropes and pulleys of the lighted backstage . " I 'm not preventing you , Burr . " On the way , Barbara began to talk to him , and Burr felt a spreadingdeflation of relief as the magical creature which is a lovely girl became a woman and a person . She held his arm very tightly around a gleaming puddle on the asphalted parking lot . " I 'm a little night blind , " she said . " I need to cat more carrots . I like raw carrots , too . Lots of other weaknesses . " He answered nothing . She watched , smiling . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me tell you . No , maybe you ought to find out for yourself and I 'll confine my autobiography to the warnings . Night blindness . Bite my nails . Talk too much when I 'm scared . " Anotherwhirring passage through the expressways of Detroit was like a long sea journey ; he turned the vent full and the wet evening air bathed their faces . She shifted , turned like an observant child with her knees pulled up on the seat , and went on explaining . " I 've been analyzed ! " she said . She laughed abruptly . It was a joke to her . He winced . " You too ? " " Oh , I needed it , Burr ! I was involved with a married man for the longest time , and I seemed willing to let it go on like that . You know . As if it were fated or something . I did n't seem to mind . Now was n't that sick of me ? Had something to do with my father ,  |p234as  it turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always wanted to remain his daughter . Dominating , but not enough of him . Worst combination , I found out . Typically American . Other choice : passive , too much of him . You do n't mind this lesson ? " He glumly attended his driving . " So anyway , I wanted men who were already husband and father . I guess I also resented my mother , little girl me , one day I went into the closet to play and came out with all her high heels broken , I cried it was so easy , jealous baby girl Barbara , I wanted to rob Mother 's husband from her ... . You do n't like this kind of conversation ? " " I hate it , " he said . She looked at him , smiling . " That means you 've had lots of it already . " He paid close attention to steering . The rudder does n't respond , Captain . Then use your paddle , son . Eyes straight , mouth tight . " That means , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she added in a voice of duty , " Certified cured now . Arrested anyway . I 'll always be a little bit that way , but it 's within the norm and controlled . Men like slightly dependent , narcissistic , needing encouragement little girls , especially when they are independent , devoted , capable , honest , and true . How I became King Arthur was in one hundred and fifty-six lessons with Dr. Kasdan . Multiply by twenty and you get three thousand one hundred and twenty McKinley dollars and no graduate school for Barbara . " She paused . " Comment ? " " Nice night tonight , " he said . Now why the devil did she choose this way to warn him ? He was willing to accept responsibility for his actions without medical histories . And she could n't play dead possum for him , either . Not that familiar hunk of fur in the eye . She was a human being who made her own sly choices . Someday he would need to tell her about some old friends of his , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatp235was the other one 's name ? A corporal . Knocked on the head gloriouslyfor democracy and being human . Made their own choices . Yes . Cal Janus . He overshot the expressway exit he needed ; the engineers take control from the stuck , slotted drivers ; he overshot the next ramp , too ; they finally came out into an unfamiliar area south of what used to be called Black Bottom . Frame houses huddled tall and stiff in darkness , waiting to slide their contents onto the roads in the morning . Instead of returning to the express highway , Burr threaded his way through a maze of streets back towards the house where Barbara lived with her father . She planned to stay in Detroit until after the campaign and then go to New York or San Francisco or St. Louis . " Why ? " he asked . " Well , I think I 'm kind of needed here now . " " I meant why those towns . " " Oh . To live , " she answered . " All those places at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll write their names on slips of paper , stir them in somebody 's hat  --  will you lend me your hat , sir ?  --  and pick one . " " I do n't wear a hat . Why St. Louis ? " " Oh dear , " she said , " well , you know . You know . I know somebody . I like that bock beer . There was this party in St. Louis once . . . . " She was smiling . She knew he was jealous . He saw the happy smile and stopped the car at a darkened corner , leaving the motor running , and the smile went on gleaming in the dark . " You really are very young , " he said . " I 'm in my middlethirties , but I still think a beautiful woman is older than me in all the important ways . By beautiful I mean woman . You know . Men think that such a woman has secret knowledge that keeps her from . . . that enables her to . . . Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really think that about me , Burr ? " she asked . " That I 'm beautiful ? " " Yes , yes , " he said . " My wife is beautiful , too . " He said very slowly and precisely : " Laura is a very beautiful girl . " She was still smiling as he crossed the intersection and slowly the car flowed through the nighttime streets . The sky was dark ; once dark branches brushed the roof of the car ; he let his left arm hang out , cooling . He was deathly afraid of her . He wondered if she knew that , too . He wondered if her smile meant that she had heard very much  --  that he had said " woman " about her and " girl " about his wife . " Here you are . " " Well , good night , " he said . She did not move . He kept the headlights on and the motor running . Courtly , he got out to open the door and escort her to the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not sinus ; it was that she had expected to sit awhile in the spring evening , and if there was to be no sitting awhile in the spring evening , she wanted to be the one to decide , not Burr ; so she sniffed again . She recognized her error . She had been listening to his desire , not his intentions . " Arc you sleepy ? It 's been a hard couple of weeks . This campaignis rough on everyone . I think Mike is all tuckered out al-ready . " " I 'm only just getting involved , " she said . " I love it . Mrs. Hen Robin Grant tickles the life out of me . " From the porch he heard the motor of his Pontiac cough , stall . He would have to change the idling speed , give that little gismo a half turn . " I think you might make it , Burr . " " Really ? You think there 's a chance , Barbara ? No , no , but in two years maybe  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running against you . I think so . Anyway , I 'm going to stay up now and read Lord Acton . I bought a little paperbound edition  --  "  | " I think you know everything about power already , " Burr said . " I thank you , mon capitaine , but am I corrupted by it ? I do n't have absolute power . " " You absolutely do n't need it . " She smiled . They shook hands very formally , as if the skin were badly blistered . Hers , small and very warm , lay within his . He received an icy shock  --  there was a key in her fist as she opened it . Then she put the key in the lock and was inside the house and lamps went on as she moved about . Funny about that key , Burr thought  --  nervous Burr . She 's gone . She was gone . In the deep night , after the sparring raggedness of their evening , Burr felt that sudden pang of the loneliness of good-bys . How much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ? Maybe he would never see his friend again ; maybe he had never seen her . This instant of reconciliation to being absolutely alone once again always threw him into despair . Had n't they forgotten something important ? Were n't they leaving incompletepieces of themselves with each other ? Was there not much more ? This moment is always waiting at farewells ; only long quiet friendship or the fusion and swift , steep sleep of passioncan drive it off . Then Burr recovered and retreated quietly within himself . Air soft , breath easy , shadows of birch branches under street lamp . Generator light of the stalled car showing red . It is as if , when you start to give yourself to another , you slip partway out of your skin ; you are hanging there ; it takes time and it takes pain to climb back in . Down the walk he found himself still absent . The palm of his hand was cold where the key had touched it . The birch shadows moved in a soft spring wind , but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barbara ; his life failed to have reality to himp238without quickening desire . He leaned against a birchtree . No , there was no safe place within where he could find refuge from the sense of Barbara which pursued him  --  toward which he ran . Laura had withdrawn into her own loneliness where he could not reach her ; how long could a man hope to find her tomorrow ? Iie could peel off a strip of birchbark and rub the roughness on his hands and smell the edgy , filmy wood . He could get through this moment on the midnight street and then climb into his car . He could perform the necessary emergency gestures and take another breath . But without Barbara he was simply alone . DRIVING FAST , RUNNING THE YELLOW FLASHER LIGHTat the corner , he left Barbara ; and when he came gulping up out of the loneliness that flooded over him as it had in adolescence , he remembered that he had a wife , two sons , and an important work set out for him . It was as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mark and Dan . A strong instinct for politics and the lust to fulfill it . What gave him the right to desire more ? This question gave him rights , he thought angrily : Do I really have a wife ? Without love a man grows distant from himself . At Burr 's age this distance could no longer be softened by romanticnames into a poetic sadness . It was fog and isolation . It was the condition that leads either to love or to illness . Do n't I already have a wife for bed and talk-to ? And a car , he thought , reaching around to lock the door . A Pontiac sedan is my cave retreat . Let that pass . But another graver , more pertinent question . Is there a time when a man has the right and the power to do anything ? Yes ,  |p239there  must be such a time in each man 's life , when he can test himself against both the best and the worst within him . After that he can subside with the right to sail under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing himself entirely . There must be such a time . When is that time ? He can never be certain . When can I assume my time ? And here he took a deep breath before making his decision . When I believe in the strength within inc . Then not now , not now . Is there another time ? Yes . When I can not bear the weakness within me . Now . Now . And he was already home , parking the Pontiac in the carport . Surrounded by the signs of a hopeless effort  --  the garden equipment , the children 's toys , the familiar house within which his wife treated herself for her ills and flaws  --  he sat for a moment with the motor running . The steady whirr troubled him . It was too much like a classic newspaper suicide . . . . And he smiled . A difficult performance in a modern carport . Like making love in one of those pretzel-shaped , castiron-and-canvas chairs . For the carbon monoxide melo you need enclosures , a sealed in space , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had was a leanto shelter under which , wintertime , the snow drifted and puddled . Freezing is too slow  --  Little Boy Burr asleep in the snow . He shook his head violently and made a loud cough to distracthimself : cough cough . Such thoughts were mere indulgent ones made of this evening 's indulgence . At this moment Barbara was reading her paperbacked Lord Acton because being with him had left her unable to sleep . Foolish , foolish . Silly Burr . She was probably yawning until her pretty palate cracked and putting her hair up in pins . Cough cough , harumph . Your turn at real life now , Mister Candidate.  |p240He  heaved himself out of the car and thought : Now to tell Laura all about Mrs. Hen Robin Grant ! Maybe she will laugh , or smile , or be amused . Maybe Laura will be wide awake and no gastric tension . He went again as he had many times before , his shoulders hunched with hope like a boy 's . He heard the lock turn in the bathroom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I want to tell you about Mrs. Grant ! It was amazing ! We might have a chance after all ! " Water was running . " I ca n't hear you , Burr . Wait a sec . As soon as I finish in here . " Her being locked in the bathroom exasperated him , although he knew that this time she was not picking her face . She was bathing . Still he wished that she had left the door open . He could have washed her back and talked with her . Well , that 's all right , wait , wait , and try again . She had let him wash her back a few times . He remembered a thrill of mixed pride and humiliation  --  Whence the pride ? ' Whence the humiliation ? He had carefully soaped , rubbed , rinsed , while she said , " Do n't get funny now , " and then abruptly , when a few drops splashed on his shirt as he leaned dizzy over the steaming tub , he had ferociously begun to tickle her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miracle , a woman 's flesh , swelling and twisting and flinging a soapy arm over to tumble him into the tub , clothes and all ... . Why , remembering their laughter , was she always so careful to lock the door ? Why so much shame between them ? How hard it had been to get his soaked clothing off . What happens to a belt . Shoes . Squishing . I Ic smiled . He waited . He was used to waiting . He sat outside the bathroomand watched a wisp of steam curl up from under the door . He remembered the one greatest happy time of waiting.  |p2411946  . Back in Ann Arbor again . Laura was telling him , that first time after the war , that she was still a virgin despite college and the Red Cross and the bombardments of London . " Oh , you remember me , Burr . . . technically . You know how girls  --  so selfish we did n't suspect  --  that college fooling  --  oh , you remember . I liked you best but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was furious red . " I want to tell you . I am , finally , really . " He had looked so frowning and worried that she had hastily added , " Is that wrong ? Have I done something wrong  --  not done ? " " No , not if that 's how you felt . " " You 're worried that I 'm cold or something ? That I wo n't be able to love you enough ? That I 'll be too stupid ? " " No , not that . I 'm even , well , in a reactionary , petit bourgeois , counterrevolutionary way sort of flattered . " " But I see you 're unhappy . That I did so much kidding every-body ? " " Well , Laura . " " That you . . . ? " " No . " And now he smiled . " I 'll be able to manage all right . " " But ? " " But with sweetness and brains and all the intuitions in that little bag of intuitions you carry , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through it . No one can . It 's this : There is nothing as mysterious as they tell you . Love is something special , that 's another matter entirely , but an incident in the sack leaves no mystic radiation . Positively no afterglow of a hundred massed violins . You proceed about your business . Not alchemy . A good salt swim lasts longer . " " I 'm glad you 're a good swimmer and had lots of ocean ex-perience . " " Shush . Do n't tease me . I 'm thinking hard , I 'm thinking aboutp242you . Later on  --  who can tell ? It always happens  --  there may be trouble between us , and then you may think that what you 're really missing ... " She had looked very serious , pouting , innocent and sad as a child to think of how sad she would make him someday ( might , impossibly might ) . " And then , Laura , just at that time of trouble  --  now I 'm thinking about me  --  just because we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to accept that you catch up on your girlhood . " They frowned and sat close on her bed , fingers laced , disconsolate . Finally she sighed and suggested : " You would n't want me to go out and catch up fast now , would you ? When you 're absolutely-lutelysure that I want only you ? " At last they both laughed . They sat holding hands on the bed for a long time , looking into each other 's eyes . They were as close as brother and sister . He would not take her now . He went home singing , all mixed up , I gave my love a cherry without no bone , I gave my love a chicken , it had no stones . . . . What the devil kind of postoperative , gall-bladder chicken was that ? Why Was That Cherry So Cheerful ? He whistled , danced , skipped , and was sure the war had been worthwhile , it had made Laura and him so smart , and was sure he would get to be Judge Learned Hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and him to pull with it , and just as he got to his room the telephone rang and it was Laura , saying , " Oh , Burr I want you so . " " Trouble with gazing into each other 's eyes is we get crosseyed . That 's why we got to do something else , Laura . Save our eyes for the books . " " Oh , Burr , you 're a nut . " " You want me to sing a little folksong I just made up ? I call it Green Sleeves , ' or Take Your Arms Out of the Spinach , Burl. ' "  | " Oh , I love you so much , Burr . I mean Mister Ives . " The next night , on what turned out to be a negative anniversary , that is , just one year before their marriage , very properly and solemnly , with no kidding , ceremoniously , like explorers planting the flag of the U.S. of A. in dangerous Unholy Wazuli territory , they went to bed , woke each other at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Detroit . Spring evening . 12:22 P.M. One thing he had been cowardly wrong about , of course , much as he had thought he was sure and powerful in possession of Laura , was in that whopper about plain sex being just creamy , sex with someone else just an incident , a turn in the sack , and a couple of raw elbows . A good salt swim ! Let someone buy him a ticket to the great salt sea which could make him stop thinking about ... 1956 . Detroit , same spring evening , 12:26 P.m . Laura came out of the bathroom smiling , scrubbed , steamed , her hair up in a towel . She had washed it herself  --  a sign of good spirits . On the days of low-pressured irritation she could spend four or five hours in her beauty parlor . She said something very ordinary , very plain , wonderful : " The children were so sweet today ! Mark wanted to know God 's last name  --  " " Damn ' ? " And the rare gift of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repeated , forgetting that he had used almost the same words with Barbara : " I 've got something there I can use . Mike can use it in the paper  --  we 'll have the whole city tolling . We 'll make Mrs. Hen Robin Grant a laughingstock . " And Laura announced , still smiling : " You know , I did some-thingI could never do . I had a nap this evening  --  just a few Minutes , I think , but I feel so refreshed ! It 's a good sign , do n't it think , that I can relax like that ? " " A good sign , " Burr repeated solemnly . Was he not also self/centered to speak of Mrs. Grant 's senility as something " I can use " ? But she was not wanting to discuss her psychology of sleep now . ' ! ' lien it was a good sign . " And I dreamed a little idea , Burr . In a few weeks it will be summer . How about  --  before the campaign gets really hot -- why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We can leave the kids with my mother . Just a few days , just us two , okay ? " " Laura ! Do you really want to ? " " We 'll just swim a little , throw a ball a little  --  " She blushed because it was her idea . " Yes , " he said , " yes ! To hell with the campaign ! " " No , not like that , it will be good for the campaign . You 'll come back refreshed . It 's a long time ahead of us . " " Yes ! " he said , and felt his face folded in relief , pleasure , and smiles . " Would you like a nightcap ? " " No . " " Bun , " she said softly , " let 's go to bed . I see you had that idea yourself . " For he was gathering up the pillows to put on the telephone . They did not want to be disturbed , even by Flinn about the Teamsters ' council tomorrow . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agenda . They would pitch him hard and he wanted to be ready . Agreed about Taft-Hartley , okay , but what about the live issues ? That one still had a fuse , but it was n't lit . And maybe he would ask a question or two about what the drivers had to do with Jimmy 's contributions to the Republican chest . Let him gas off , sure , but what kind of insurance did he think he was buying with the drivers ' money ? Not that they would n't vote for him anyway , and he felt for Jimmy , really felt for him deeply , the idea about keeping little thumbs in every pie around , but still . . . Sam Flinn would stop him before he got his knives that far into Jimmy . ) " Hullo , husband , hullo , " Laurap245was saying . " Hullo out there . You like me better in lace or in nothing at all ? " As she stood across the room beckoning to him , she put her arms up to touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breasts slide and her legs were spread wantonly with the little mound dark under the lace night gown and she was better in nothing at all . Flow did Laura know when to pull him back from the precipice ? Or was it not that she knew tricks , but only that she loved him ? " Oh , a nap and a bath , " she said afterwards , curled up for sleep with her mouth against his chest . " On a wife a nap and a bath do wonders for a husband . " In the middle of the night , their arms lovingly cramped , all the moments of Laura 's pathetic violability came back to him with hurt and pity . At a party for Mike and a few other friends after his return from the national caucus , he had heard her proud brave party voice bragging , " When Burr has to be away , he writes to me every day he 's gone , no matter how busy he is , and the letters keep coming for a few days even after he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that he had not written to her from Washington . He had telephoned twice , but he had not written . I-le had not even known that these few days required a letter from him : he had been busy , and the hotel meeting rooms put him far from family . But Laura was worth all the successful caucuses in the world when she loved him and he could answer her . It was the great meeting of the politics that matter forever . The next morning they all took breakfast together and Burr was late to his office . He played horsy with his sons , and with the whooping and stomping about , and the trick with the coins , and the wheelbarrow game , it was ten o'clock before he finally left the house . All day he had an aching longing to return home to hisp246boys and to Laura , but despite it he wrote a fine sharp speech , was crisp and clear in conference with McKinley , had a long lunch with Mike in which they slyly plotted and planned . Mike objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not argue with him . " Idealist ! Idealist ! " he laughed . " Get married and see what you have to do to live ! " " Marriage has nothing to do with it . Do n't be silly . I still think you should make your campaign on principle . " " The principle is to win ! That 's the principle , and the only way to do anything good  --  you have to have the power first . " " You have to have the power , Burr , but you have to earn it first . " But Burr 's humor was too great for this many-years-old argumentbetween Mike and him . " Mike , forgive me , I have to get home early . Laura has big plans for the kids and me tonight  --  a picnic in the back yard . " Later Burr wondered , on the long drive home which provided his daily chance to think himself through while fighting the traffic , why Mike winced . Because Burr dismissed him so quickly ? With envy at Burr 's marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call Mike tomorrow and ask him to lunch , or if he wanted to be huffy , give him the chance to refuse the invitation . Even old friends have their pride . In the back yard the paper plates were already out on the Sears picnic table . Dan had the job of putting a rock on each plate to keep it from blowing away . " Pickanick , pickanick , pickanick ! " Mark shrieked , dancing and throwing himself about with drunken delight over the new word and everything else in life . " Mark does n't even remember we had a picnic last year , " Dan said solemnly . " I 'm bigger . I remember . " Mark stopped as if he had been turned off . " Daddy , what 's God 's last name ? Dan says it 's Dan . "  | " That 's what Mommy told us , " Dan said defensively . Laura was got up in a pretty , flimsy , decorative little cotton dress , with a cashmere sweater over it , her arms not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face was fresh and her eyes clear and Burr was astonished to remember that this was his wife who had had an appointment to see Dr. Berman earlier this afternoon . She rubbed and purred against him and said that she had made all the arrangements about their trip . " You 've not changed your mind , have you ? " " Of course not . What a wonderful idea it was ! " Because if you think you ca n't spare the time  --  the campaign  --  " " Of course I can ! " " Oh , Burr , " she said , " I love you , Spouse , and to prove it  --  hot dogs , potato salad , and root beer . I do n't care if it rots our teeth ! I love you ! I love my spouse ! " " Me too ! Me too ! " Mark and Dan chanted . " Mc , me , me ! " They squeezed into the squirming mass of flesh and intention which is a family . There was a picnic . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate , played , and finally sang almost like naturally fevered birds . CEDAR POINT ON LAKE ERIE . YOU TAKE THE EDSEL . FORDExpressway to Telegraph Road , Telegraph Road to Route 24-A ( for Alternate ) into Toledo , and then Route 2 toward Sandusky and Cleveland , but you stop at the turnoff and there is a long windingroad , a parallel stand of pine , and then nothing but the place itself on the sand at the end of the road . The Breakers Hotel at Cedar Point is two hours from Detroit if you drive as Burr drove.  |p248But  this time he did not drive as Burr drove ; he went easy , anticipating , content . Three hours . " Are you warm enough ? " he asked his wife as they registered . " Warm enough , " she said . " Tired ? Want to rest before we try a dip ? " " Want to rest , " she said . She squeezed his hand to tell him that she was all right . " But I know you 're for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just cover my eyes for a half hour , and then you come and get me . " Ile started down the beach alone , just idly kicking sand , when she ran out barefoot to join him . " I was n't sleepy after all , " she said . " I decided . " That was five days ago . It had seemed very straight and beautiful , a fine beginning to the little vacation , good conjugal fellowship , a wonderful unremarkable moment between two people who simply were content to love each other . Five days ago she had done that , he had held her hand lightly in his . He had run into the water . She followed him , screeching with the sudden purling cold . Back in their room just off the beach , he had rubbed her dry and warm , glowing . Four clays ago she had begun to fret a bit . No reason , she said ; just fret . They called the boys . Everything was all right . Three days ago he had said how lucky about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , was there ? He was hurt because , because  --  because he had thought what they did was enough . Two days ago . They had been alone almost all this time , swimming , sunning , reading a little , taking meals , strolling , going to bed early . The sun went down and the place looked a bit gritty , grim . Called the boys again . One day ago . Very warm . Fell asleep on the beach . Woke up and Laura had driven into town for the paper . Did n't want to wait till it was delivered out here . Today.  |p249Beach  , lake , and sky rich with deep afternoon colors , with early summer prosperity and only a few crisp leaves blown out onto the sands , which were white , tended , raked , and heated for a long season  --  he thought it must mean good luck . Why not believe in case and health ? Why not believe in reviving ways ? He sat up , feeling the sun on the burned bridge of his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week 's vacation before the season , when on another year a thin spring rain might have kept them off the lake and quarreling in the hotel . No rain , no clouds . It was a good omen . Another omen : he had told his office not to call him unless there was a real emergency , like Mrs. Grant getting headlinesby peddling reefers in a rock and roll den , or Mike had a small child stuck up his big fat how-silly nose and needed old Pied Piper Fuller to sing it out . There had been no calls except one curt as a telegram from Mike : " All okay here . Have a good time . Bring me back some taffy . " Omens . An optimist still , Burr piously took good hope from good omens although not bad hope from bad ones . He was just about to nudge his wife and tell her what his idea of a real emergency would be . " This sand looks clean , " Laura remarked , turning fitfully at his side , " but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes closed , wide awake , trying to court sleep by pretending . It would be a nice surprise if she found it . Her thigh twitched and Burr brushed away a sandfly . " Maybe you put on too much lotion , " he said . " They do n't seem to be attracted to me . " She sat bolt upright . " Do I look greasy to you , Burr ? " " No , " he said very precisely , " no , you do not look greasy to me , Laura . " He waited for this to subside . He hoped it would . " Say , Laura , I was just making a little list of the awful things that could happen in town . I see it like a movie , flickwise . Old Hen Robin sobs and says I 'm the better man , she wants me to take the job  --   |p250I  sob too , but I 'm careful to admit she 's right  --  we sob together . Does this have mass appeal huh Laura ? " 1310 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not listening to him . She was drawn and rigid . It was churning inside ; she was sucking a Turn . Burr gave up his joke . He heard the shrillness in his own voice . He had a great fund of obedience to Laura 's moods . Where she exactly was , he did not know ; but his heart turned heavily over and it followed her down . She was back in the little trough of sand formed between her two sharp wings of shoulderblades . She closed her eyes , working hard at getting a tan , one of her several anxious enterprises . Just when you have a good one , it begins to fade , and where are you then ? Merely yellow . She covered her eyes with the little pads of cotton she kept for that purpose . Now that she could not see him , he felt emboldened to look at his wife , this angry , dieting , sunbathing , and distant creature with whose life he had been joined since their college days . Yes , the oil on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under them and she scratched idly . He saw on her thighs the punishment of her mistrust of flesh : a stringy looseness replacing the firm health of first youth . Of course , it was still true that she wore clothes well . She dieted for that , and got what she dieted for . But in a bathing suit ( or undressedfor the great dance  --  he thought with an ache of anger and of love ) her bones were as sharp as her discontentment . In winter she had a resenting gray face , masked by the sunlamp which reddened it ; now there was the bronze of daylong sunning over what was gray within , needing a pill . And yet they had rolled and wept with pleasure sometimes , and fine sleep afterwards  --  or perhaps with desire of pleasure , with planning and plotting of pleasure . It was why they were here . They had arranged this vacation alone in one more effort to bring back their good times and makep251good days to come . The peace of the before-season resort , a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the lake , lazy , easy , a bit tired , much sleeping  --  this gave them hope of focus on each other . The attendants at the hotel were grinning and indifferent , sure of their tips and a good summer . To be alone like this was to be on a wedding trip . They had wished to make it together again . Laura was really sleeping now . Her narrow girlish breast rose and fell regularly . Good . If she slept in the afternoon , she would be relaxed and able to sleep later . And thus no pill . And she would be pleased about the almost effortless sunburn she had acquiredduring the hour of oblivion . And no guilt about a pill . He got up carefully , straightening his boxer trunks , watching to see if Laura stirred to notice while he left her side , and began to walk down the long beach . There were a few children running about , and parents studious of them , and fond fat grandparents . It was not the time of the year for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the word " frolicking " and glanced back to where she dozed on the sand , her bottles and tubes piled by her side on a towel , her glasses and watch in a slipper . And " young "  --  another word ! She needed to lie flat , to become irritable under the sun , flesh quivering when a fly pricked , anxious and compelled by her ideals to get deeply tanned , even at the cost of trivial discomfortand boredom and the yellow which inevitably followed her few days of brown success . He went to the edge of the water where the stiffened , wave-lapped sand made a springy path for him . " Susanna ! " the voice cried out . But he did not see who had called , because instead he saw Susanna herself wave to someone back on shore , climbing and jumping into the feathered waves , a flashing happy girl with dropletsof water glistening on her shoulders in the sun . An instantaneousphysical recollection of joy flooded his body  --  she was lovely . In the next moment Burr was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh early summer water , in the same lake in which the girl named Susanna happily swam . He swam towards her . Of course she did not notice him . He did not try to speak , but for the time was satisfied simply by taking these pleasures with her  --  sand bottom , then backstroke , then crawl , hissing foam against bared teeth in a last rapid spurt before coming out blowing and breathing deeply onto the beach . She did not see that he had imitated her frolicking maneuvers . She was a sleek girl in a finely fitted black swimsuit , shaking her long reddish hair loose out of her cap as she ran up the beach , laughing and dancing on one foot with water in her ear , and then he lost her among the little crowd at the hot-dog stand . He even wanted to lose her and averted his eyes as from the sun . He did not dare not to lose her . But moving toward his wife , who was sitting up and watching him , he went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dutiful week end outing with her parents before returning to her senior year at Michigan State . All right , back now , enough , he thought , and waved and grinned at Laura . She hugged her knees and said , " Why did n't you tell me you were going in ? " " I thought you were sleeping . I did n't think you 'd want to . " " Well , no , " she said , " hut I wondered where you were , that 's all . Not that it made much difference , since there are n't many places to go . Is the water nice ? " " Marvelous ! " " It looks all right . I 'd rather just admire from a distance . " " Did you really sleep ? " " Dreamed , Burr , "  --  and all at once miraculously she smiled and showed her small fine buds of teeth ( the sun ! ) and he remembered her abandoned gaiety at parties , her dancing fling and laughter on the excuse of one drink ; and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flesh afterwards . She stoodp253up , stretched , took his arm . She yawned . They lurched through the sands toward the Breakers Hotel a few steps from the beach . " Let 's have a big dinner and a big time doing nothing tonight , " she said . She brushed her hand across the hairs on his arm . The contrary touch of her fingers on his skin made it rise and tingle . There was that warm , marvelous , and secret detonation between them . His heart seemed to lean toward her . As they passed Susanna , licking the mustard from her finger after the hot-dog , he looked away . No Susanna , no Barbara . No rolling , unhappy , wandering eye . He wanted to see no one but Laura . She wanted him , too . He wanted nothing but their good marriage . By the time they showered and dressed for dinner , the rapidly shortening afternoon was over and there were blue shadows on the gravel walk outside their window . They were hungry , but not with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starved , cocktail-needing boredom . His bored exasperation with assigning too much duty to love had always been the weak side of his feeling for her ; her passive refusal to be assured was the other side of her clutching , clinging passion for him . Their unstable good spirits passed while he threaded new laces into his shoes and Laura put on her girdle . " Why wear a girdle here ? " he asked her . And she answered : " I 'm not a college girl any more , and anyway , it 's only a light summer thing . Just a little elastic to hold up my stockings . " They walked toward the bar through the echoing , almost empty corridors of this ramshackle resort hotel , all of sagging wood and peeling paint , splendor turned economical . The smart people traveled further . The Breakers at Cedar Point on Lake Erie had once been a watering place to which carriages came from Sandusky and Toledo and special trains from Cleveland and Detroit . Now the carpets on the long slanting corridors had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers below jelly like or stringy bodies ; children ran shrieking ; dark faces , blotched by age and sun , ignored the signs about PROPER DRESSIS sUGGESTED GOING AND COMING FROM THE BEACH . Into thisquiet off season brooding , economy , and early hope of summer , Burr and Laura Fuller emerged to walk toward the bar . Grandfathersand widows turned to look at them : Such a nice young couple ! " Make sure you have matches , " Laura was saying to her husband . " Do n't worry , they 'll have them at the bar , " he answered . " Yes , but what if I 'm caught without ? " He reassured her about this putative cataclysm . They had their drink . Since there was still time , they had another . Laura was silent in the crisis of incomplete devotion , although Burr lit her cigarette . Since they did not speak very much , and consequently drank too fast , they had a third Martini . Burr regretted the last two because they meant that he was still sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's arm . Dressed in a light summerfrock , her hair pulled tight against her head and her mouth flagrantly lipsticked , she looked older than on the beach . She had a frosted drink , probably a Daiquiri , over which she bobbed and ducked her head as if it were a chocolate soda  --  and with the delightof the daughter having a drink with her father . The man was ruddy , thick , smiling , and triumphant in his daughter 's pleasure . Burr wondered how many happy families like this one existed  --  what percentage of all families , say  --  and if it really did exist or merely looked that way with father and daughter smiling in the cool dark bar , touching , toasting each other . Susanna put on glasses to look about , and as her eyes behind the slanted frames briefly rested on him , he felt that she was really lovely , really ready for happiness , a really grown-up girl looking to be a woman . It was the first thing he imagined about a girl  --  it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her back not touching the chair . " I guess we 'd better be getting along to dinner , " Laura said . " What are you thinking about ? " " Nothing . You ? " " I have a little sprain , I think . Not serious  --  just from falling asleep on a lump in the sand . It 's really nothing , Burr . Do n't be concerned . " He resolved not to be , but made a solemn face so that she would not read his thought . She was only a few years older than Susanna , but she had always , even at Susanna 's age , worn that fret of unhappy self-love between the eyes , and had never known Susanna 's elegance of stance and movement . His wife was slightly stooped at the shoulders , narrow at the back ; " petite " was her word for it . Now he turned again , hopelessly , thinking that even Susanna'sname  --  not Sue or Susan or Susie , thank God , but Susanna !  --  spoke with a confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susanna . But despite everything the years were with Laura , his years and hers ; and her fretful judgment  --  that she was the prettiest of all  --  was almost true . What fine large eyes ! ( The better to devour myself with , my dear . ) He sat with her in an overlarge dining room , insects thumping against the screens , moths circling the chandeliers high up , in this place once chic and wild , now calmed under the grandparents and blurred by the children . From one corner of the room came a rhythmic cry : " I want some , I want some , I want some . " From another , behind his back , Burr could feel the pressure of Susanna with her sweet , nice , ordinary parents glowing in the presence of their daughter . The waiters brought the food , took away the plates . Dessert was vanilla ice cream , grainy and starchy . " I want some , I want some , I want some , " said the greedy unformedmouth.  |p256Why  did they not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! a childless couple 's explanation . They had been drawn together at a ski resort in the strange intimacy of bereaveoflack  --  they had played bridge . Their new , passing friends had finally confessed , putting down the cards and staring at them across the table : " We 're cousins and we 're afraid . " But Laura and Burr were not cousins . But they were afraid . Their two sons had not helped . They thought they were being rational . Like all those pseudorational , irrational men and women who count overmuch on romanticlove , they waited for some impossible perfection between them before they could dare to have children again . This romantic perfection had once seemed in their grasp , as they wrestled together on the beach of their first summer together , and then was forever retreating , retreating , called back by the excitement of birth , by a moment , a day , a breath of feeling , then retreating again . They were strange to each other ; their children were strange to them . Still Burr hoped about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another child , perhaps a girl this time . After their time of marriage the idea was ordinary , although it seemed to him fantastic and needing schemes and plots and preparations : Let 's just go on , Laura ! Perhaps he should not have waited : perhaps he should just have said it . But he had learned to be a cautious romantic . And he had superstitious worries about Laura 's knowing how he looked at Susanna , how he looked at Barbara , at fresh and healthy girls , and how this might corrupt the health and desire which he wanted for her  --  for the mother-to-be . Tonight , in the sweet dark , if she felt well , if her back had stopped hurting , he would talk with her about it . He would not look at Susanna at all . He would imagine Laura , his delicate and quiet Laura , and only Laura . He would not taste , smell , imagine the skin of Susanna , to whom he had never oncep257spoken . Barbara was far away ; he wanted not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would sleep very well . She had strong ankles , strong hips ; the blood was good to her , despite her back and her insomnia ; she was strong despite the worried self-love which took her to Dr. Berman three times a week ( what did she say about him ? how did she judge him ? ) . But she could do for him , and he for her , and they would have a greedy lovely girl infant , too . He would leave the dining room before Susanna could cross before his eyes . " That was a lot of sun today , " he said . " Let 's turn in early , okay ? I want to call the kids , too . " " I 'm willing , " Laura said . " That 's what we carne for  --  the rest . " " Let 's telephone Mark and Dan right now . " " Oh , they 're beautiful , are n't they , Burr ? " " Oh , they are , honey ! " She took his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they retreated from dinner . Burr felt a muscle twitching in his leg because he was still young and willing to run , swim , work , and make love . When Laura said that she wanted to bathe again before bed , he recognized her acknowledgment that they would make love tonight . She said " bath " casually , and with a dark , sideways , challengingglance from her very dark , smudged eyes . She was signalingwillingness and preparation . She would spend a long time in the tub , scrubbing , relentlessly cleaning herself in water almost too hot to stand , and emerge wan and soaked and her finger tips spongy . The thought of so much foaming effort , so much ferocity spent on cleanliness , inexplicably isolated him and he could not wait for her in their little room . He wanted to fold her in his arms just as she was , warm after the sun-soaked day , only partly undressedand he would help her the rest of the way , carrying her top258bed , warming her , warming himself to her ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you had a bath before dinner , darling . " " Wait , wait ! " He was alone in a hotel room . Warped pine and lake dampness . He went out to walk in the corridors of the hotel , feeling for his pack of cigarettes , cramming it unnecessarily back into his pocket so that he could go to buy another and talk with someone . Did he need excuses ? He felt ashamed of his loneliness . He was not looking for Susanna . He was just looking for someone . He was just waitinguntil his wife would be ready to receive him . Then why the deep drawing pain of anxiety and anticipation in his belly ? It was the pain of excess and indulgence  --  it was lower than his belly . No , it was for his wife , not Susanna , and it was not pain . His wife too had those marvelously abandoned , beautifully irresponsible momentsthat he read into the girl 's slim , unhurried , smiling ease . ( Charm means to be certain  --  sure of yourself . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , to cut loose , to hold on . ) And he did not find Susanna either at the tobacco stand or at the desk , where he went to ask if there were any messages for him . He expectednone . Ile had thought of Barbara  --  campaign business . Mike could take care of the office . IIe was just asking . He needed a human voice to answer him . The desk clerk was used to loafers , gossipers , men afraid of their four walls . He was a narrow-chested old boy in a blue nylon cord suit and a red paper flower in his lapel from some celebration to which he had once been invited . Ile believed himself skilled in " handling people , " sizing them up with his eyes , measuring them down , and he wore his eyes frowning and smiling at the same time , crumpled with the labor of telling all : I know , I know , I see through you ! It takes head !  --  and he tapped his skull . What did n't just come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He figured it that Laura was abed , that Burr had the wan/dering insomnias . " The little wife sleeping ? They sure like to get their rest , do n't they ? " He did n't need answers , not him . His own questions gave him all the information required . " Those pretty little mothers now , they come to the lake for a vacation from the kids . " I wish we had them here , it would be better  --  but he did not say it . " It 's hard on the grandparents , but you need some fun once in a while , too , do n't you ? I see lots like you . It 's swell . Do n't worry , you 'll hear from them if the kids are lonesome . It 's really swell to have a little peace and quiet . " Burr returned to his room . By this time Laura would surely be ready , scrubbed , oiled , and bedwarm in the shortie nightgown he had given her the day they left Detroit . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was out on the dresser and she was ostentatiously , challengingly sipping water . " Laura , not " he cried out . " Did you take them tonight ? " " Shush , I have a fright of a headache , Burr . Too much sun  --  you were right . " She must have waited until she heard him at the door . " I knew I would n't sleep without them . Dr. Berman says it 's okay  --  " " But you wanted to break the habit , and you thought that if you could just relax , have a relaxing week  --  " " I know , I thought so , but I knew I could n't . " " But Laura ! " And he flushed deep red , felt it like a jilted swain , murmuring , " I wanted to talk to you . I wanted ... " As if this meant that he did n't care about her headache , she shrugged angrily , her tan and white and pink nakedness of breasts winking at him under her flimsy gown . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , and brutally she stared at him . Many times before they had fought at this moment in their lives , but many times they had resolved afterwards to make it good . He had put forward the news  --  hot , cold , frightened , determined  --  that sleeping pills were more than a symptom , were at momentslike this an active agent in their trouble . It changed their life together . Could he hold in his arms a woman blunted and blurred and worrying only about her sleep ? " Why not ? They are n't all that effective , " she had argued . About what it means , then , he had said , and pleaded with her : " Why do n't you at least wait to see if you can fall asleep ? " " For the same reason , " she had once answered , " that I go to Dr. Berman without waiting to see if you can help me . For the reason that I 'm desperate . I ca n't rest , I ca n't sleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still shapely , fresh , and pink in her new nightgown , she stood there waiting for him to make up his mind . It would be decided within the next few seconds  --  everything , or the trip to the beach , which was now everything in their lives . He looked at the bottle on the dresser . He looked into her narrowed eyes above the feverish , painfully sunburned cheeks . " Okay , " he said , " let 's go to sleep , I 'll be with you in a moment . " " I really had an awful headache , Burr , " she said , softening abruptly . She took a step toward him , and with a rising rush of relentingfeeling , of desire and regret that almost swept him weeping against her , she moved forward and put her arms about him : " From the sun . From worrying about Mark and Dan . But it was a mistake . Kiss me , Burr . You were right . You were right , but kiss me anyway ! " But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the bathroom . He ran the water for a while and sat on the edge of the tub , holding his head in his hands . When he felt he had his control back , he got into pajamas ( a gift from Laura  --  they had the same ideas ) and went stealthily to bed , stealthily because she had turned off the lights and was asleep , her face turned away , composed whitely , judging him by her white , still , angry sleep , or pretending to be asleep , no difference ; and then he really was . Itp261was as if he shared his wife 's drugged retreat from the truth of their life together . He fell off into it with a great weight tied to his head . In the dream that came to him almost at once he did whatever he wanted to do , she did whatever she wanted , and they wanted the same things . Her name was Susanna ( Barbara ? ) in the dream . He awoke with the top of his head hurting where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile looked at his wife and wondered whom she dreamed of and did not care any more . He wondered if he were fated now to stop dreaming of Laura , to dream henceforward of Susanna , whose name was Barbara . Quickly he dressed and went out onto the beach . It was barely midnight , and a warm , starlit evening , leaves rustled by the night breeze over the beach . He imagined meeting Susanna , also alone and walking on the beach  --  just like a boy he imagined it . This Susanna turned out to be Barbara , too . Iie saw her asking him for a cigarette , telling him of her loneliness , and then lie began to weep , for he remembered that this is the way a boy imagines findingperfect love . They would smoke cigarettes and walk and talk . He would tell her and she would be kind to Weinstein and they could try to bring Cal Janus back to life . They would stand by the line of spume on the beach and  --  but his eyes were hurting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned like blisters in his eyes , because he was unused to crying , and the tears said that it is bad to be over thirty years old and still have need of looking for love as the boy does . The boy never finds anything except , if he is lucky , the courage to go beyond himself , and then he abolishes this fantastic ideal love . The Susannas can sleep undisturbed , patiently awaiting their chances for good and bad times , because a man has his own wife , his own children . The tears turned and turned down his cheeks while he walked the beach , sinking deeper and deeper , secured , falling gratefully out of reach into the heavy , thick , envelopingcold sands.  |p262And  started also from this dream . He stood blinking , shocked awake on the beach with his ankles wet and the night breeze flutteringat him . There is something so much more reasonable than sleepwalking on the beach when a man 's misery is complete ! Poor Laura ! Just for a start , all he need do next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wake himself entirely ? Why not Barbara ? LAURA CURTISS FULLER FELT THAT SHE SHOULD ALSO BEa person , besides being adult , American , female . She took cognizanceof her unique advantages of body and mind over other women . She was clever , neat , and pretty , and looked well in both suit and frock . She admitted cause for satisfaction  --  children , husband , self . She admitted cause , and yet she did not rejoice . She was not satisfied . She had the calf , waist , and breasts of a Junior Miss , but she no longer asked that primitive schoolgirl question , Are You Happy ? She knew the answer too well : She was miserable . She believed that the soul of Laura , which should have been immortal , was imprisoned in the decaying machine of Laura Curtiss Fuller , which had no rights over her at all . Laura 's soul wanted to be good , good to everyone and good to Laura . Instead the body of Laura Curtiss Fuller churned against her husband to have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not answer to the demands of Laura . She wanted to be gentle and pleased . She had been let down . Laura thought : Could I have been different ? She sometimes stood in the fenced yard behind her house with the evening cool upon her face and asked : Could n't I have been different ? Could n't I just decide , right now ? And then sometimes in the morning she awakened and thought : I will not be let down ! On such a day , when happy resolution com/forted her , she telephoned Dr. Berman to say that she would not be able to come to her appointment ( this was called " resistance " ) ; she thought of some little gift to please her husband , a sweater , cuff links , Segovia 's guitar ; she hustled Mark and Dan around with teasing jokes ; she planned a special meal for Burr and decided that Laura knew what Laura wanted . The day passed swiftly in anticipation , the guitar music she put on the record player prickled at her in many joyful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm lovable ! She tapped her feet and drowned in guitar music for Burr to return home so that she could tell him how wonderful he was , she was , they all four together were . Sometimes he came home on time and saw her as she was that day and made himself felt on her . And she believed that she could decide anything . She could make herself be Laura for Laura and Burr and the boys . Usually now , however , the hour in which she lived conspired against the time in which she believed . Burr entered worried and did not see that she was different , everything was changed , all , all , they were to begin anew this evening , tonight , right now ; by his face she saw that he did not understand her ; a hot rage of disappointmentflushed through her , and before he had his coat off , before he finished greeting the boys , she lay hidden within the body of Laura Curtiss Fuller once more . Cold hands , stiff cold feet , a fever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Their sons were rooting in their daddy 's pockets . " You want them to have teeth like  --  " He had no right to put this fever , these chills upon her . " Teeth like your mother 's ? Is that what you want ? " " Even if candy  --  " " It rots the teeth . " " I want some ! " shrieked Mark . Burr said , " It 's only baby teeth , Laura . " " Habits are what count . They 've got to get the habit of refusingsweets. "  | " And anyway , Mother 's teeth were n't so bad , " Burr said , " when she had them all taken out . Please smile . " " Gim me , gim me , gim me , " Mark and Dan were shouting , unheardby their parents . And thus Burr never knew that she had spent the entire day planning how to be good to him . He spoiled things . She recognized that she spoiled things , too , but she had planned otherwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While he read the newspaper , pretended to read it , she remembered that noses get longer with age and someone had said yesterdaythat she had a " generous " nose , that the cartilage of ears thickens , that flowers are merely the genital organs of the plant , that the cells of her body were each instant sickening and dying and making her unclean . Her hair did not shine as it used to . The boys who loved her at college had all gone far away , her husband was reading the newspaper and making sighs of desperate boredom and anxiety , and how much longer was her nose ? She wanted to be good ; Laura really wanted to be kind and good ; but how could she when her lips were so dry ? She worked them over with cream and lipstick . She applied lanolin . She tried the jelly of the queen bee in a precious cosmetic that promised Deep Down Inner Magic . But nothing yet created reached this burned-over aging , and she knew very well , she did not need Dr. Berman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was ill . Without love , she was perishing . Poor Burr , poor Burr , she suspected that he wanted to love her . Instead he gritted his teeth in his sleep , woke up , sat in the bathroom looking for something he had missed in the newspaper . Poor Burr , she could not tell him how to love her because her lips were too chapped and , besides , she did not know . Since the happy days of being a princess , a beauty , a charmer in college , she had never known how to be happily loved . And then in college it had been the magic of adoration . Deserving nothing ,  |p265she  had merited all . Because her body wanted to be free , she had been able to throw Burr out of the swing when he crushed her dress . She had giggled ; he had loved her harder ; war , separation , letters . It was a fine time , she thought . I had plenty of room in the closets for my clothes . How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At moments she saw clearly that this was what had happened . From being an adored creature , sure of the sweet curve of breastand buttock , she had become a worried housewife who saw ropy tendons in her thighs when she turned before the mirror . Was this the only turning her life could take ? Was the vanity of her body destined to become dread of it ? No , she knew that she could have done better , been better . Dr. Berman said nothing , but she judged herself . The pleasure in being adored is not love , various love . She had thought that she could gather blackberries without being stung by thorns , burned by sun . She had not been taught , she had not learned . Instead she had dreamed of herself in a large hat , perfumed , with an organdy gown and a basket which her cavalier filled with ripe berries while she rewarded him with a glimpse of herself in a swing . It was never like that . She had counted too much on the shy wild adoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a child and how it might make her breasts smaller . Whose fault ? In college she had controlled how the boys touched her . She had never learned to give up this control with joy , and Burr had not taught her . Whose fault ? Nothing had been as she dreamed it . Whose fault ? I should have had a lover in college , she thought . I should have learned giving and taking then , and got nettles in my hands . I should have done some work in the world before I got married . I should n't have hurried so . I should have learned to value somethingelse besides love , I should have satisfied myself there . I should have , should have , should have done better.  | " Oh I know I 'm so often wicked ! " she cried out to her husband . " But I do n't want to be , Burr ! " He stroked her as if she were a bomb that might explode . When she wanted to be shaken like a tree , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as if she were a weapon to be defused ; and when she wanted to be stroked and comforted , he shook her in fury or furious lust . Yes , true enough , when she began by blamingherself , she ended by blaming Burr . She realized that these crises usually came at her " time of the month " ; she tried to make a joke of it . " Bring home some Lydia Pinkham 's , " she said over the telephone . " I think I need a snort . Oh Burr , come home and hold me . " She wanted to be better . She tried . She cuddled her younger son . She made a cake for her husband . She looked for the hard , ruthless right way to be Laura Curtiss Fuller as Laura wanted to be . She closed the notebook in which she kept a daily record of her weight . She would paste recipes in it instead . Silly girl , she thought . Someday everyone  --  so she had predicted at age seventeen  --  would listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now we have long-play discs and discount houses and antibiotics , and no more virtue than before , though sonatas by Bach &; Sons ring out in the night of selected suburbs . And die . And still die , poisoned by age , . Silly Laura-girl . Oh , but I could have been so different , so gentle , often good ! And this , she somberly decided ( a pretty and quick young woman , too thin , too angry , but very pretty despite the tendons which stood out on her arms and thighs ) : this is merely the child 's restless conceit . I want to be charming again , as I was . Is all I want . Poor Laura . Poor Laura . Poor poor sad little Laura . Love me , somebody , love me quick , love me despite my notebook , my analysis ,  |p267my  pouched disappointed beautiful eyes . Somebody do that for me ! MAYBE , BURR DECIDED ON THE WAY ALONE TO THEmeeting , I really need a praying mantis bride . The praying and preying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . These insects make love in a fashion which startles even the pureheartedbiologists . The male comes hippity-Lop looking for the female . He finds her , approaches , penetrates . While the is embeddedthere , the female calmly eats his head . For her it is food like other food , and a crunchy morsel . She is always hungry . However , this curious event in nature is not- a mere instance of greed confusing love . It is an essential step in their lovemaking . If the female does not eat the male 's head , lie remains impaled there but unable to perform the act of sex . I leaded , he has an inhibitory reflex . Snap , crunch . Headless , he frantically performs his dance of love and death , being both food and brilliant lover leaping for joy in final agony . Jigajig . I am not a mantis , Burr was thinking , however pious I look . I need a woman who will allow me to keep my head , allow me to love and help me by loving , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . It was a League of Women Voters meeting to which Burr was driving , and perhaps it was this that made hint remember the habits of insect life . Laura more and more was retreating from the campaign . The children needed her , she said . Although this was a meeting where his clever and attractive wife could have been of importanthelp , she sent him alone . She was tired and asked to be ex/cuscd . She believed that there might be a transference crisis on its way with I ) r . . Berman ; she had that little premonition in the form of excess acid ( more Turns ) ; she would know in a few days . So instead he had asked Mike and Barbara to meet him at the elementary school where the discussion was held in order to help explain his program to those who could not talk personally with him . Yes . For that . The political people , members of parties and workers for gain , sat morosely pondering on their digestive organs during the speeches , pouting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to congratulate him or ask a brisk American factual question . ( " How many weeks do you think unemployment insurance should . . . ? " " Are you in favor of a tax cut to stimulate busi-ness ? " ) Burr found this combination of democratic boredom ( or contentment ) and democratic urgency ( or skill at tickling themselves ) both familiar and uncomfortable . All over the nation , by television and newsreels , in bars and houses and majestic assemblies , Americanswere profoundly considering who would make the friendliest Uncle . Politics became a pleasant American game , like baseball , just when the questions were mortal . In a time of hydrogen warfare , he had to sell himself as if he were a slightly different brand of soap : the more noise and advertising made about it , the less difference there in fact was between him and the other brand of soap . That there was a difference he refused to doubt ; he consoled himself ; blast Mike and his doubts ! He had ideas about unemployment insurance and where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as specific as the present facts justified . Mike wanted him to point out the lack of logic of those scientists who testified , one minute , that the amount of hydrogen fallout in the air was easily within three per cent of the permissible limit ( leukemia , cancer , birth of monsters ) , and then said , the nextp269minute , that they had not determined the critical point  --  so it was 3 per cent or 5 per cent or 7 per cent of what ? Maybe they were right , but what kind of logic was that ? The logic of hypocrisy and indifference to life . " You 're right . I can imply my doubt  --  " " Imply ? Tell them , Burr . " " Mike , I 'm just running , " he explained patiently , again and again . " I 'm not in yet , I 'm just running . When I 'm in maybe I can do something . " " But when you 're in , " Mike asked , " wo n't you have to run again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight . His own law practice needed tending . Barbara would be there if he wanted help . " You dripnosed idealist , you horny-handed worrier from the Legal Aid , " Burr said , poking his old friend on the shoulder , " and notice how long my wind is getting . Practice , deep breathing , and deep speeching . Why do you put up with me ? You never approve , do you ? " Mike grinned wanly . " Well , you 're enthusiastic . You 're tenderhearted . I 've known you a long time . " " The reformer 's instinct , that 's why , " Burr said . " I 'm your favoriteproject . " But Mike did not seem happy . His tall , sallow length of body in the never-failing dark gray suit with a darker stripe  --  all his clothes looked alike , winter and summer  --  had grown perceptibly stooped in the past year . His skin was thickening with an unhealthyoily patchiness under the eyes . Because of his liver , he had given up drinking ; because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature , he seemed to have given up the idea of marriage ; he was settling into a bachelor 's nervous ways  --  a habit of tapping the telephone with one finger when he was impatient with the caller , a habit of sitting and sitting in disconsolatesilence , watching Burr and Laura put the children to bed ,  |p270and  then rushing out without saying good-by . All his faces were rainy Sunday afternoon faces . He had even stopped adding to his record collection . Once when Burr stopped by to see him , he found his mailbox filled . A man who does n't open his mail is either in love or in trouble . Well , Burr decided , once this campaign is over I 'll have to begin worrying about Mike . There must be a girl someplace for that kindhearted , generous , salt-of-the-earth old egomaniac friend of mine . Later . Burr 's reactions to the evening meetings followed a regular course . Before beginning , he was uneasy , unsure , and inclined to blame the people attending them for anticipated foolishness . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face ; he felt himself rising to the challenge . Finally , in the excitement of talk and discussion , in the pleasure of laughter and approval , he would realize with a shock that his T-shirt was wet with perspiration , that his legs were aching with fatigue in his tense standing before the crowd , and that he had thoroughly enjoyed himself . They were smarter than he had anticipated . They were shrewd , intelligent , and approved of him . They were with Burr Fuller all the way . Once a middle-aged man with a smooth fat face had waited without making a move to speak with him until everyone else was finished . Burr saw him watching , smiling , showing his widely spaced teeth , and all at once recognized that he had not had the missing tooth replaced and the others had spread to fill the vacancy and it was Allen Turner . he disengaged himself and approached the man while still hot , trivially exalted from being at center of the crowd 's focus . " How are you , boy ? Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allen in his nightmares . ) " You have n't changed , Allen boy . " Allen flushed and looked flattered . " Geez , I have n't ? I thought I gained a little gut . " He sucked in his belly and strained to live up to Burr 's lie about him . " You sure changed , boy , now you 're ap271famous man . We 're proud we used to have you in the Chapter . " How , Burr was wondering , did he ever get squashed like this ? Why has poor dangerous Allen , the villain of my adolescence , becomea lump of nothing ? he has been dismissed by life . His jowls are mere chicken skin , plucked . " What you doing now , Allen ? " " Oh , I made out fine . I 'm still in the organization , I 'm National now . " " National what ? " " National Office of the Fraternity . I just stepped right into it like I never left . It 's a swell job , Burr , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of the fraternity to heart ? Well , now I keep in touch with all the chapters , guide the fellas , the boys , you know , like provide a little mature judgment when they need it . We let them ask us . It 's more permissive that way . I never had the good luck to marry yet , Burr , so the boys are sort of like my own sons . Well , I treat them that way . Like we got this race problem comes up now and then . . . I 'm there when they need me . It 's a good job , pays , security , pension plan , expense account , you know . Travel a lot  --  Pullman , planes . I 'm telling you all this because hell , everybody knows about you , so I thought you 'd want to hear . " Poor idiot , Burr was thinking . This was the beast of my nightmares . " Like why , I went on the TV last winter , had to explain the ideals of brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know . You would n't think you 'd have to be on the defensive for a great institution like ours , but they got those subversives in high places , you know .... " " I 'd like to have seen you . If I 'd have known  --  " " Well , it was n't exactly a national hookup , like really national . My folks here in Detroit could n't get it . But you could see me in Washington , Baltimore , around there , you know . Winchester ,  |p272Virginia  , too , if you had a good aerial . Funny running into you like this . " " Yes , funny . " Allen smiled and Burr saw the tongue searching the narrowed space between his teeth . " Heh-heh , " said Allen . " Not so funny , since I drove clear across town when I read about you in the papers . " How instinctively the man took the posture of defeat ! How could fifteen years alter their stance toward each other with such brutal efficiency ? " Some crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dormitories and frat houses may not be enough in the world of men . Silence between them as the hall emptied . Allen coughed . He had some reason besides curiosity for drivingacross town to see his old college buddy . He had something on his mind . " That was quite a little nitiation we had for you , remember ? " He went on very quickly , sure that Burr remembered . " Those were the days . Course we do n't do that no more now , Burr . Hell , they call it hazing . Gainst the regulations . I 'm ver ' hard on the fellas when I get wind of a case  --  I thought it 'd give you a bang to hear that from me . Hell ! 0 tempests , 0 morries , eh kid ? And speaking of morries , did you hear what happened to old Charlie Morris ? Chuckles ? Charles ? He got himself a million or two from his grandfather , and he never told us he was going to ! Yes , well you never ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' boy , I suppose you 're busy . My business is being nice to the fellas , so I do n't notice how the time passes . " Burr felt the reproachand felt pity for this forlorn creature , still making the fraternityhis family . However he could not remember Charlie Morris and wanted to talk something over with Barbara , who was waiting . Now that he had seen him , he could barely remember Allen . This did not please him . Those circuits in the brain must rememberp273everything in order to recall the self ; he did not want to lose the memory of Allen merely because he no longer needed it . " So listen just a sec , boy , there 's one more thing I got to say to you . " Allen put out his hand . " And that thing is  --  good luck . It 's good luck from old Allen Turner . You 'll need it , but you got my sincere good wishes and bygones be bygones , boy , okay ? " They shook hands , Allen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away as if so moved he was afraid of tears . Burr realized that the man really did mean what he said : Good luck . And Burr realized that he was ready now to let bygones be bygones , just as Allen said . Allen wore a single-breasted jacket over the heavy rolls of fat at his middle ; he marched off with the American Legion strut of the permanent boy , waddling slightly , wearing white buck shoes with red rubber soles . Burr watched him past the folding chairs of an elementary school auditorium . At the door Allen turned and waved , and this time there was a spontaneous grin on his face . He was rendered happy by finding Burr still watchinggood-by after him . Many other times Burr met old friends . They marked the space that he was crossing . These meetings usually left him on edge , as if he had drunk too much coffee , but they served a useful purpose , too , in settling his dreams . Tonight 's meeting at Taft School impressedhim with the avidity with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own cleverness in being direct and frank without committing himself more than he wanted to be committed . He used all his wits to avoid , to sidestep , to hint , and implicitly to flatter by letting them in on the shared joke . He was no male mantis , at least not here , and kept his head . ( He had combed it for maximum podium charm  --  fore-lock . ) Barbara had come in a taxi . Before leaving with her , he went to the bathroom to wash his hands ; he had come prepared for summerheat and campaign labor . " Boy 's "  --  with sinks to the size of ap274boy . As he bent to wash , he remembered when the sink had been to his sire . In his briefcase he carried a clean shirt carefully rolled up ) with socks in a T-shirt . He stripped off the damp clothes and washed himself carefully , with soap , using a towel to protect his pants . He scrubbed with a cold wet washcloth under the arms , around his neck ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it vigorously with a towel , and combed , and pulled the towel lint off his comb with two fingers . It was almost as good as a shower . He had developed this ritual after many weeks of speaking at meetings . Especially today he wanted to be clean . Ile had no other models for himself . He combed his hair back as it naturally fell in private life . He simply wanted to be himself , and to do that job as well and as cleanly as possible . Now the job had to do with making sure that he was washed in body and decided in spirit about Barbara . Though he could be washed , he could not yet be decided . Though his hair was combed without boyish tricks . " You 're heading the wrong way , " Barbara said when they were driving again . " No , it 's the right way . " " The wrong way for my place or the office . " " The right way for Greekville . Let 's have a bite and some Greek wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense alertness . Once he had teased her for her nervous mettle . It was , she had replied , a stage in a girl 's or a horse 's growing up . Before she lets the saddle be put on . Barbara 's dark gray eyes , long at the corners , were located with that extra millimeter or two of distance from the nose which gives the look called " honest , direct . " " One millimeter ! " she said when he told her . " Now I have to live up to it , whether you like it or not . " " Teeth too . The smile . You have to live up to them . The way you raise your chin . You 're living up . "  | " Thanks . Millimeter and chin are how I got to be honest , direct , and a tennis-player in your eyes . Much easier than holding a racket , working on topspin . " Monroe Street in downtown Detroit is an enclave of Middle Eastern life amid the spilling , leveling , building energies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially the coffeehouses  --  great , drafty halls filled with marble-topped tables , men disputing or playing cards , no women at all . Each coffeehouse was the club for a different area , as argued by the name printed on the front windows : Athens , Peloponnesus , Macedonia , Cyprus . In each , night after night , the men in white shirts , suspenders , unshavenbacks of necks gathered to fight old wars and drink their richly sugared little cups of coffee . Monroe Street lay outside Burr 's district . He had hopes of going unrecognized although his photographhad begun to appear in newspapers . Ile parked ; strollers overflowed the curb , sniffing the air , talking , just looking things over in the old easy Mediterranean fashion , not yet confined to barbecue pits and suburban back yards . He led Barbara into the Greek Britannia , which had a front room with tables covered by oilcloth and a back room with high booths sheltering the couples who wanted shelter . Burr wanted shelter . " Do you know Mavrodaphne ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district ? " Burr grinned . " Let 's not be political tonight , Barbara . No , Mavrodaphne is a Greek wine  --  thick , rich , sweet , and nourishing . Almost like a ceremonial wine . Maybe it was a ceremonial wine once . " No , I do n't know it . " " Will you try some ? " " Will you ? " The waiter stood smiling over them , and finally said , " Why do n't you sample it first ? I offer you each a glass . " " No , I know what it is , but thank you . Bring us two glasses . "  |p276He  brought two water glasses and the bottle . " Take , " said the waiter . " I leave you now . You tell me how much you drink . " Barbara pretended to look for the mark on the bottle . Burr took the bottle , held her hand a moment , poured . His hand shook and he had to jerk it away from the glass to avoid making a tattoo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment , but rather as an excess of energy . During this campaign he had more than met the demands of strength put upon him ; his blood had responded with an excess , so that he could fight , scheme , and work all day , confer at night , go home to his wife and struggle there , too . Hope and desire filled him with strength ; he could not imagine defeat . There was strength left over for Barbara , though for Barbaraand what else he still did not know , nor to what extent Barbara created the powers he felt . " Efraisto , " he said when she poured the second glass . " Thank you ' in Greek . " Barbara was a mystery  --  nervous and patient , eager and distant , laughing at him and making it clear that she was determined to have him . Or was she straight in herself about this , about him ? He knew that he overestimated the determination of women . He had always thought that the decisions of beauty were easy , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , every accidental brush of her fingers against his ( setting him afire ) , every sly smile and turn of her glance ( banking him , taking him fiercely ) . It was this intensity of calculation , or of seeming calculation , or of meaning in each action , which reduced him to a shy boy who mooned over her just as if he had never had a wife , never sired his sons . He wondered if she wished him a boy . Or if she wished the man who might take a wife , make sons , win an election . They drank their wine at the Greek Britannia ; they talked ; they went . Jitters , itchings , headaches , dizziness , fantasies , all these boyish  |p277|pim|ples  and twitters had reawakened in Burr Fuller . And also the boy 's quickness and alertness , the full of desire . Dark jealousies , lightheadedness , angers and switchings of his voice midsentcnce , mid-word  --  Burr 's unexpected assent to another for what he had set in motion himself , first out of hurt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terror to his eye when he looked at her . Would he always need so much more than he had ? Barbara turned up her lips for smiling and lowered her eyes . Or did she bring this about herself ? Or had Laura done it at Cedar Point , or earlier , at all the Cedar Points of their life together ? Or were they responsible together ? He had turned to Laura once in the dark , while she slept , and touched her back for comfort in his dismay . She should wake up and help him stop hurting her , hurting himself . Could anyone win in this matter , as he hoped , by will and effort , to win an open and public election ? What could he ask Laura ? Let her sleep . Then he dozed , he awoke . IIc slept again . He got up at seven , strangling with excitement at the thought , Today , today . . . and it only meant that he planned to suggest lunch to Barbara at the Rathskeller , or a return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a walk along the Detroit River where the excursion boats came in . If this was merely an adventure , and an adventure hardly begun , where do adventures end ? Waiting for the boys to stir , lying early one morning near the drugged body of his wife , he watched the deepening dawn light on the street and feasted himself on it . Why not enjoy dawn again ? Why not enjoy dreams ? Why not force the dreams into daylight ? Was it possible at last that this was love ? All his dreading body asked a no , no , no , and the hurtful questiondid not grant him retreat . Pleasure is awful . Sweetness is dangerous , the bittersweet most threatening . IIc had forgotten what a girl is ! Complication , trouble , divided gaze , and washing withp278strong soap to he sure that his wife did not sniff out Barbara 's scent on his shoulders and hands  --  poor Laura . And all the while a singing strength to his body , an alertness of stance And talk , his sense of Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . There was a reason that his candidacy was in earnest . Barbara knew it , and glowed with pride when he did well . Laura too seemed to know it , but her answer was different ; her early interest soon dwindled away , and for her it was just another job to take him from her . She saw Dr. Berman and her appointments conflicted with some of his best meetings ; she tried a tranquilizer that might not make her skin break out ; she lived from day to day on the edge of tears , anger , jealousy  --  an edge of anxiety which is a firm plateau of boredom . " You seem to be prospering , " she said one day , as if she were commenting about a mutual acquaintance . " Yes . " Meantime , he argued enthusiastically with Mike about how best to use Mrs. Grant 's " Hen Robin Speech . " He had already made crowds laugh , and the phrase " Hen Robin " brought anticipatorysmiles among those who had absorbed the joke several times already . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the crowds still roared . It helped that they knew it already  --  they got ready to laugh by chuckling . He could talk to McKinley and give him his own strategy , no matter what the experienced man argued , and convince him of it . He could do these things because at the end of the day , or in the middle of the day , or early in the day , he could find himself parked someplace , just like a college boy . Because Barbara could slip across the seat toward him into his arms as she did now , this evening , like a boy with a girl . They were parked under the dark of a burned-out bulb in a lot near the Detroit River . The great expanse of parking lot was empty  --  no event , no graduation , no lee/ture in the Veterans Memorial Building nearby  --  and only the tiremarks seen by their headlights spoke for other cars , other hasteningvisitors . The lights of Windsor in Canada , amazingly to the south of them , flickered through the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deserted lot , in a corner of their noisy speeding lives , when the motor was switched off and the heavy heat of downtown Detroit fell over them and Barbara fell toward him , they were no longer visitors . They slowed , they stopped . In that place alone they truly dwelled . Or so Burr thought as they both fought for breath toward the kiss they had not yet ventured , were only now venturing  --  doorhandlejabbing him , a nerve in his ankle quivering as he twisted and shook off the shoe , sliding down , slumping on the scat , pulling Barbara with him , and his back aching like some seventeen-yearoldkid 's with his steady smoocher at a drive-in movie . Her mouth hardened , relaxed , spread under his . Her body hardened , arched forward , slid painfully under his . They did not kiss again and again . They were not adolescents at a drive-in . They accepted one long embrace , hands reaching and plucking . And all was as before . Starlight and concrete , and he could smell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not as before . They were now alone in the closed car , the humming center of Detroit excluded , and the campaign , and Laura and the boys , and yesterday before he had kissed her . They were alone together peekingout at Detroit as they had peeked at Mrs. Grant . Now he saw no adversary , no Detroit with its slabs of skyscrapers and its crawling , ever-moving roads . He saw Barbara in his need . Perhaps she saw Burr . " I 'm not sorry , " he said . " For what ? " " That I 'm not more brave , " he said . " Braver ? " " That I want , " he said.  | " Please ! I want too , Burr , more and more . " " Will you go with me wherever I go ? " She was nodding her head between yes and no . The movement of response was what he needed , was assent enough , though he was not sure himself of what he was asking . His hand shook to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proud yearning rise to his fingers . She slipped her hand into his shirt . To be locked in a car in each others ' arms like this was not a mere joke of return to first youth . You have to go back and start over . In love you always have to start from the beginning , and the weight of memory and other loves gives you no advantage but weight . Burr wanted what he had always wanted . It was an ache in his heart to understand that he had wanted only Laura when he hoped for love from her . His need was constant , but now he wanted Barbara . He wanted the woman somewhere who could be made happy by him , and if her face and name were Barbara , then Barbara was the girl of whom he dreamed . Barbara was the girl of the youth he had not yet finished , or ever would finish until he was happy in love and work ; she was the joy he had searched in Laura , and in loving Barbara , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No metaphysical fidelity to Laura could be created out of this necking in a car , this hot blessed distending of another woman 's nipples . No . There was another matter or two . Laura was a person by herself , not the creature of his need . In the thickeningair of the closed automobile , as he turned to Barbara , he groaned ; he kicked , he expelled Laura ; he opened his eyes and held to Barbara as if he were drowning . This too is a time when a man can do anything ! They made love through clothes in an automobile , petting like college kids . Barbara claimed his flesh , making him twist and jump , and ferociously he squeezed her , thinking , dance ! dance !  |p281And  then he heard his secret voice speaking to Barbara : " Not like that . We should n't like that . " She rested her head in the crook of his elbow , slowly , very slowly withdrawing her body . " No , you 're right , Burr . We should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful about you , Burr . You 're not a professional at this , you 're so amateur ! " " At what ? " " At this . " If she were laughing at him , it was very quiet and deep within her . " This , " she repeated , touching him . " Yon mean it . You need . . . " Very deliberately she said , " Mc . You 're not playing me like a hi-fi set , turn the knob and get true sound . You  --  " She 's telling me I 'm a great lover though married , a young lover though a father  --  or what is she telling me ? Doubts , doubts . His mind began to function again . " Next time , " he said , " we should  --  " She pulled all the way away from him and he watched as she hitched around her skirt , straightened , lipsticked , bustled , and then leaned back and put her arms lightly about his neck . " My fault for starting to talk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other time . " " Tomorrow , Barbara ? " She put her finger , shh , on his lips . Then she said , " Hold me a minute . Just lightly . Then take me home , please . That 's our plan . " " We should  --  " " Please . Hold me . Right now . Not another word . Just arms . " He did . That , and then the motor and his own heart gave him power and peace . He had thought that he would be diminished , that he would be shamed and weakened by pollution ( not like that , Barbara , like a high school boy ! ) : but instead , despite her tense withdrawal now , her dark tousled head held stiffly awayp282from him , he felt a dark cool peace between his body and his will , their bodies and their wills , after that meeting in a parking lot in the shadow of the City and County Building . He felt more relieved , more naked with her , most naked indeed because mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease when he drove . " This is only a beginning , " he said . She said nothing . She was finished talking . He needed no reply . Assent was in everything he knew about himself , would come to know about her . Unlike the praying mantis , he did not need to lose his head . There was time , patience , and power ahead . What had been secret from themselves and from others would come to be secret only from the others . IT WOULD HELP TO ARRANGE A SHARP QUARREL WITHLaura and gather all his discontentments in one ripe justificatory gesture . Laura had entered the dark worlds of brooding , where she was losing her womanliness because she did not believe in it , where she lost joy because she had lost joy . Burr pressed his lips tight , knew that he must partway have done it to her , did not know how he could have avoided doing it or how to rectify his sin . Making up to Laura for her life with him was an impossible household chore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be asked of anyone . For love of her , Laura seemed to believe , the ideal husband must absolutely do the impossible  --  this is : live without love from his wife . Burr felt , gritting and straining , that he had to save himself from this wreck , and believedhe had a right to , and yet cowardly dreamed that he might finally prove his love even to Laura by putting the toothpaste back in the tube . When he met Barbara , he believed that he had met someonep283who believed in herself , therefore could believe in him . All right , he made the troubadour error and looked for perfection . But when he did not find perfection , he could still take joy in what he found . If in a troubled life Barbara believed only partway in herself , she could believe partway in him ; and when he had nothing from a woman , that was very much . A quarrel would perform the sleight-of-hand of placing his decisionoutside himself . Funny , although lie had almost planned for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own time exactly when it came . He was returning medium late in his life , not so late in this particular evening , after painfully leaving Barbara at her door . As always , the neat little , clean little , suburban little house exasperated him . Entering from the murmurouscool evening of early summer toward the cold gleam of all those modern lamps  --  cones on pulleys , aluminum reflectors , three-way bulbs in many cute disguises  --  lie felt like another bleached modern gimcrack among the foam-rubber furniture , the driftwood pinned against a fireplace blocked with red plywood , the Lautrec affiche ( not Dufy , at least ! ) and the pile of Skira art books  --  extravagant anniversary or birthday gifts from his loving wife , yrs. , Laura . ( And yet , " What Love commands is suave labor . " ) " What 's the matter ? " he said to the empty lighted kitchen . No one there . The house was hot , the windows blurred with steam ; the oven was crackling for heat , BAKE . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the boys ' lighted bedroom . " Why are the kids still awake ? " Laura , frowning and hot , was sitting on the edge of Dan 's bed . " Mike wants you to call him as soon as you can , " she said . " He 's been trying to reach you . Says it 's important . " " What does he want ? What 's the matter here ? " The boys were both in bed with round astonished eyes and a disorderly mound of toys . " What 's up , Laura ? "  | " There 's a measles epidemic going around . I think they 're gettingit . " " Any spots ? " " No. " " 1 ) o t hey have fever ? " " Not- yet . " ' " Then what 's the matter ? " " I do n't know , they 've been so irritable . They made me feel irritable , too . I wanted to get them off their feet . I said they could wait up for you , I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy ! Daddy ! " Dan 's excited voice piped thinly . " Mommy says I 'm sick ! I had soft-boiled eggs ! Come and play with me . " " Both of them ? " Burr demanded of Laura . " Preventive measures , " she said , and stared at him with cold challenge . " Even sometimes causes sterility . " Measles . The idea of measles thought : To hell with the gas companyand the pilot light , that furnace goes off as soon as I get down to the basement . He peeled off his clothes to the T-shirt , splashed cold water on his face and neck  --  the windows were all in steam , the house was a hotbox  --  and went to perch like a jowly doctor on the edge of Dan 's bed . Ills son babbled away at him about all the recent exciting events , thermometer inserted so queerly , intensified attentions , consultations by home medical guide and telephone . Burr felt his wrist and forehead . The eyes had a hot petted sparkle , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth ! he should run for Congress ! ) were nothing abnormal in an excited child . " I 'm sick , Daddy , I 'm gon na have quarantine ! " If he were sick , the rumor of quarantine would make trouble for a wandering campaigner , that contemporary doorbell-ringing  |p285equivalent  of the pleading minstrel , goliard songster out for a vote . Maybe he should take a hotel room . . . But what nonsense ! The kid was not sick , no matter how many goddamn measles freckled out in the neighborhood , and Laura was an intelligent woman someplace deep within her anxious fantasies and knew it . Burr felt absolutely convinced of his diagnosis : too much mothering , overdose of fret and fuss . It would give any child spots of red in the cheek and a suspicion of fever . The gas furnace had no need to labor on a fine spring day like this , when Barbara wore a sleeveless black blouse which showed her rounded already tanned arms . " Member , " said Dan , " member how I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when it rained all day and I made pictures on the window . " Idly he had drawn with his finger in the steam , but the pictures did not stay . " Member how you gave me crayons and told me to get dressed and we went outside anyway ? " Yes , and July is when Mother is convinced that you have polio , darling . And fall is the time of burning leaves and an acrid beauty to the industrial skies and her sons have possible vitamin deficiency , Mother thinks . And winter is the time of struggling over the thermostat and penicillin for head colds and one fidget after another . He played with the children and sang the French songs they loved . It was easier to sing French than English , because he could console himself for his voice by the thought that French is Educational . ( Laura sometimes even laughed at his jokes . Why could n't she live for the joys in life , and even the jokes in the troubles ? She could not . ) He tucked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her face because of the way he had looked at it . Why could she not understand that her face was pretty , almost beautiful , and when he looked at her that way it was a plea to his very own wife , not a demand upon perfection ?  |p286He  busied himself with the boys . " Good night , good night , honeys . " Hushed : " Good night , Daddy ! " Let them please not dream , as their mother did , of illnesses which cause pity ! He waited , Laura waited , they waited together until the children finally fell asleep . They asked for water twice . Anxiously they wanted to know : sick or not ? Mommy or Daddy ? They asked for water again . Help , help , they were saying . " You do n't like me when I 'm sick , Daddy ? " Dan murmured . With a hurt pang at his heart , Burr answered , " Of course I alwayslike you . But I do n't want you to be sick . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep , boy . In the morning you 'll be fine . " " Me , too ! " piped Mark from the other bed . " You 'll be fine , too , Marko-boy . Shush now . If you really need water again , you can go to the bathroom and get it yourself , you do n't need me . " " I want one more kiss ! " " Me too ! " Yes , of course . Burr wanted it too . He tried to calm the beating of his heart as tenderly he took his sons in his arms one more time this evening before the fight with his wife . Like illness , the boys smelled it in the air . Even the wide open windows could not dispelthis taint , although the steam and winter closeness brought back by the furnace were already dissipated by outdoor breezes . " Now good night , boys , " he said firmly . " Leave the door open a crack , Daddy . " Burr did . They wanted to listen . Ile left the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , and Laura sat facing him across the table . He took a deep breath before plunging : her way was to seem not to breathe at all . Even when the bird walks , one knows that it has wings . Even when Laura was sweet , her anger lay folded , throbbing , waiting . Now her face darkened , as if the blood were unclean with rage . Clotted , paining badly , she lookedp287for rage to rescue her . And so ( Burr 's teeth grinding ) she would deserve what she would get . She could pull her mouth down and let it spread with reluctance to answer , but this would not stop him . He knew her well ! " You 're going to make him a hypochondriac , both of them ! We 're raising a goddamn bunch of sissies ! Is that what you want ? Why do n't you wait till they 're sick before you jump ? " His own voice , under great pressure , had the snake 's hiss in it . " You , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . You have your . . . your . . . your business . Your election and your drinks with the boys and your I do n't know what . You do n't care . Measles can affect the eyes  --  " " But I tell you they do n't have measles yet . " " You would n't care if they did . " " But the thing you have to concentrate on , Laura  --  now please concentrate , and not forget , bear it carefully in mind  --  is this : They do n't have it . Fear does worse things than measles to children , but here is the chief point for the moment : Mark and Dan do not have the measles . " " You 're in your speechifying mood now , Burr . Do n't get pom-pous . " " Please rephrase the news if you do n't like how I say it . But if they 're not sick  --  " " You would n't care if they were . " He looked at her helplessly across the table . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her eyes . He said : " You want them to be sick , you want inc to be sick , you think that 's how a man needs a woman . You want to be a goddamn nurse . " If only I were a cripple , he thought almost with longing , preferably at the legs so I could n't move . . . " You think need for a woman is a tray in bed . You 're turning into  --  " She looked at him full , her tired , pretty , thirty-year-old face flaming : " Maybe you 're right ! I read hooks , too , thought things ,  |p288did  things before I became a housewife . Dust , clean , cook , but do n't touch your papers ! A housekeeper ! Leave your secrets alone ! A maid ! What an existence ! Maybe I need a husband in addition to sons  --  " You need ? What about me ? " Help , help ! Abruptly the black of her face fell away , and a deathly paleness replaced it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge , then , not of rage but of despair  --  same thing between them in the end . She reached out to touch his hand across the mottled plastic . They had been leaning , hushed for the children 's sake , whispering ferociously at each other . " Please , " she said . Now the desire to destroy him was gone from her eyes . " Please . Oh , what 's the use , Burr ? " She paused as if deciding whether or not to say it , and then spoke without deciding : " You 'll never learn about me , Burr . " Of course , when there 's learning to be done , it has to begin on both sides , and maybe it was time to admit : Too Late . You have to have a will for it . Burr admitted ( yes , why not ? ) that he had withdrawn the will . They defined their rancor to each other hopelessly , helplessly , rehearsing the old lines , with Laura strangely cold and adamant and Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , he had predicted , planned , and even desired this quarrel . He was a moral man : the quarrel gave him rights while his rage kept its purity . It was best to hate Laura 's withdrawngrace . Young matron ! Handsomest wife in the Democratic Club ! " All right , Burr , I 'm sorry , you 're sorry , let 's go to bed or something . I made your supper . . . . I suppose you do n't want it now .... " It was silly of him to show tears ; it was not required , although it increased his privileges . He gave himself no added credit , however , because he was thinking of the way Laura used to be ( a greatp289walker with him in the markets , in country lanes ) and that was fine but probably not so fine ( who can remember for sure ? ) as Barbara might be . And Barbara 's gaucheries meant nothing becauseBarbara would learn to be smart and better than Laura , and anyway smartness is n't everything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a Master 's and to have thought seriously of a career in art history or the Red Cross or maybe doing books for children . No , he granted that he deserved very little extra credit for those tears before Laura . Many times he felt worse but did not cry . He had thought of pulling the quarrel like a rabbit from his hat , but it jumped from his breast when he was n't looking . The tears producedtheir pain even in him , and he said what seemed to stand most for that pain : " You 're ruining my sons . " She turned away , large-mouthed and sick , shoulders drooping , the housedress damp under the arms . " My sons , your sons , our sons . Oh , never mind , Burr . Stop it now . You 'll wake the kids . I 'm sorry you feel bad . Please , I 'm sorry we 're not good to each other any more . ' Would you like something to cat ? " No matter , no matter . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went about switching off the lamps because the light hurt his smarting eyes , and then submitted to the supper he had forgottenwhile Laura , her hands folded in her lap , sat silently watching him try to eat . " Do n't forget to call Burr , I mean Mike , " she said after a half hour of absolute silence . She was making an effort . " Should we invite him to dinner on Saturday ? " He looked at her gratefully for the effort . Choking , he said . " Yes , all right . Yes , Laura . " But now she had run into the living room . When he had finally mastered his tears with thoughts of revenge , and mastered the fantasies of revenge by that habit of marriage which persistently tries to put together what has been torn asunder , and felt gratitude , gratitude , for her effort toward the decent and ordinary , shep290had run away . She was standing at the window with silent tears rolling down her face . She jerked away from him when he tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood cold and isolated and asked , " What do you want ? Tell Inc what you want from me . What do you want ? " She would not let him touch her . " I want to love you , Laura . Tell me what you want . " She covered her face with her hands and sobbed . She fell to the floor , sobbing . She just shook her head from side to side , sobbing , and mumbling something . He kneeled and put his arms around her and tried to draw her to him . She fell loosely against him , yielding , but giving nothing but the flesh . They lay together on the carpet . As she wept he put his face close to hers to hear the answer to his question : " I do n't know , " she repeated over and over again . Burr , holding Laura 's loose weak body , lying on the floor with her , put her head to his shoulder and let her cry herself into a kind of sobbing doze . While he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking : She does n't know . She ca n't tell me what she wants from me . Oh I hate her ! And his eyes rolled , making inventory of the facts of their parlor , and stopped at the Vermeer print of a woman spinning , a gift from Mike on one of their anniversaries . It was a scene of peace , light , and ease , with the sun softly entering . The harsh shadows cast by an aluminum reflector could not change it . His wife 's head lay closed on his shoulder . In the room there was a green haze of light , much softened . It was tears in his own eyes  --  tears not of sorrow but of deceit . But these soft heavy tears are tears also , though selfish , self-seeking , as tears usually are . He stroked and stroked Laura 's hair , murmuring to her , thinking to say mewling comfort and weeping for his sorrow and his deceitfulness.  |p291He  remembered what he had to do . Go down to the basement and shut off the pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer heat . Call Mike . Barbara . THE LONELY LIGHTED STOREFRONT  --  BEHIND IT THEAdlai and Estes posters , buttons , leaflets , a card table heaped with what is called " literature , " folding chairs  --  reminded Burr that this had once been a drugstore , " We Never Close . " ' rhea : were shelves and even a patent medicine advertisement glued to the wall , the white-coated nosy scientist asking , " Do you have tired blood ? " No , Burr thought , I have troubles and agitated blood . At this hour , near ten o'clock in the evening , the volunteer ladies had gone home , leaving behind the debris of their good intentions : paid workers might clean up , of course . By the light of the streetlamp , Burr stood looking into the shop from outside . Narrow and long , so that prescriptions could be filled in privacy , it had been built into an alley and nestled among the little camp on the block : a novelty shop , featuring souvenirs of Detroit , paperback books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drugstore which had vanquished its competitor ; a laundromat ; cleaning-andtailoring ; a storefront lawyer 's office , " Income Tax Insurance Real Estate Confidential Investigations , " the entire ham-and-eggs factory . The Party could have done better for Burr , but he had no priority on funds in a pinched campaign . A long strip of brown paper , painted in showcard colors , BURR FULLER FOR FULL REPRESENTATION , nearly covered a permanent paint job announcing Cut Rate Prescriptions  --  First Rate Service . Burr looked into thep29blown-up , smiling , confident photograph of himself in one window . He was wearing a blue suit and a dark tic . His cheeks had been retouched , he was bristleless , beardless . His smile had also been retouched to even up his teeth . A line for thought had been put between his eyes . It was Everybody 's Burr Fuller . A smaller photograph in the same window showed him with Laura , Mark , and Dan , though with none of the harried expression of fathers in family pictures . One must not think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think of children during the act of lovemaking . The boys had been tickled , tormented , and teased until they too came across with blissful expressions . Laurawas not at her ease  --  afraid that a picture could not do her justice  --  but only he would notice . Her idea of beauty for herself sailed under false colors of modesty : " Oh no , I ca n't have my picture taken , I hate it ! Just remember me as I am . " In the other window stood a photograph of Burr watching Adlai Stevenson sign a paper . In this he wore the gleam of campaigneffort on his face , and a bow tie , and tousled hair . It was posed but natural-looking , which is more important than being natural . Smart of Mike to pick this one , a nice rough-and-tumble contrast with the homey sleekness of the other . This led Burr to thoughts of Mike , and guilty regret because he had seen so little of him in recent months , and recognition that he was really becoming a politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the indifferent . Mike edited Burr 's campaignnewspaper . Except for brief discussions of tactics , they had hardly spoken since the campaign began . Mike would not take that well . He would not happily stand still and watch Burr fly by . With a sudden fall to sense , Burr realized , standing there in the warm evening street , that whatever Mike bad said he wanted to talk about , a large part of the actual business of this meeting would be the permanent concern of his old friend : what Burr was choosing to become.  |p293He  put the key in the lock , went in , sat on one of the folding chairs behind a card table , and waited in the half light from the street . He needed rest . The occasional passersby did not look in , did not notice him . They were already bored with speeches , buttons , promises . They knew ; they were decided , despite the ritual appeals . Only a disaster or an emergency could change this  --  and yet , Burr knew , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the campaign struggle which goes its preparing way beforehand could make use of the necessary catastrophe , just as inspiration only follows upon painstaking labor . The way things are . I have to follow the rules in order to break them . That was what he would tell Mike : It 's the way things are . Perhaps he had no chance , but he would be ready to pry open the miracle if it only , please , pretty please , offered itself . Always the argument followed the same pattern , ever since college , when they had discussed the moral significance of sitting on a stranger 's lawn . Burr would say : It 's the way things are . Mike would say : Things should be different . Burr : But we have to obey the rules of life . Mike : But we can change the rules . Burr wanted to improvise on the rules in order to get what he saw as possible ; Mike wanted to change both men 's statements and behavior in order to conform with everlasting principle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitter heedless attack only possible between old friends , because they went away with a bit of each other 's flesh and brain dissolved into each . Mike learned to obey the rule of facts . Burr learned to try to change them . Mike tried to see how fact becomes principle , and Burr to see how principle must be made fact . Their friendship was anchored in the permanent moral complement they provided for each other . Or so Burr hoped . Anchors can drift in a high sea . It made him uneasy that Mike was late . Mike never kept anyone waiting . He believed in consideration for others as an ideal , and all ideals hadp294equal force as moral imperatives . It made Burr smile as he waited . Such a serious friend ! So like him ! That long nose full of solicitude , like a juicy trumpet . Even tardiness was a sin . And yet his moral friend Mike was late . Burr got up and walked about the shop  --  petitions , sharpened pencils , leaflets , printed postcards , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest issue of his campaign newspaper , which featured the ridicule of " Hen Robin " Grant which he had decided to make a campaign issue . He had dictated it himself to Barbara ; Mike had only edited the copy . It made a good spectacular bit of nonsense , and he was still reading when Mike entered . He too did not light the lights . The street lamp showed him enough . " Reading your own story ? You got admiration in the head , " he remarked softly . " It 's plenty poetic , but you 'll strain your eyes . " Burr turned to his friend and said very quickly , before he could think of all the things he had done that might upset Mike , " What 's eating you ? Take it easy with the sarcasm , boy , I 'm heap big plenty tired . " " So am I. Tired of  --  well , tired . " They turned from each other and used the noise of couples clattering by on the street outside as excuse for turning from each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being unparked . For a few parents it was a night out , their baby sitters safely embedded in pop , potato chips , tangerines , and the U.S. Steel Hour ; the Young Marrieds would have the luxury of a real movie together instead of a spliced 1940 epic with Clark Gable eighteen inches high , not needing his belt ( they saw Band of Angels , 1956 , Clark Gable fourteen feet high , cinemascope , sash hiding the belt which tucked in the honorable summers of his age ) . The girls went by in their Basic Black dresses , the men wore summer suits , and some , proudly , narrow lapels and belted rumps . Burr reached back to touch his Ivy strap . Trousers , he thought . I am a proper young man and I shall wear the back of my trousers belted.  |p295Those  girls , those girls , Those lovely seaside girls .. in their Basic Black dresses ? No . But Barbara was not afraid to take the chance of being wrong about her dress , though she just happened always to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burr recalledall at once the obvious information that his animus against Basic Black came of Laura 's habit of playing this thing safe , and Modern , too . He had moved so far from Laura that he resented even the slim neat sheaths in which she liked anonymously to encaseherself ( and in which she had looked so lovely to him ) . The long backwoods Santa Claus face of Estes Kefauver suddenlyfolded into a scowl , a shriveled grimace , disappeared ; Mike had taken a campaign folder , crumpled , wadded , pegged it into an overflowing wastebasket . It bounced out and skittered across the floor . " I ca n't write that stuff ! " he broke out . " lien Robin Grant , Hen Robin chirping , Hen Robin feathering her nest  --  sure she 's ridiculous and this is a campaign newspaper , but what does that nonsense have to do with anything ? What do you stand for in this campaign , Burr ? " " I 'm standing for an election , if you want to put it elegantly . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you care about . " " I have to get elected before I can care about anything  --  " " No . " " Effectively  --  " " Not at all . " " Let me finish . Have to be elected before my caring for things has any social effect . The reason I wanted to run , the reason you wanted me to run , was that some of our ideas could be put forwardsignificantly  --  not just as liberal jabber . Now I have the chance . " " Now that you have the chance , Burr , you 're behaving just likep296any other liberal politician  --  running , that 's all . Running for your own sweet self . Just running . You 've said nothing to let peopleknow how different you are , if you are . " Burr flushed and looked away . He did not like needing to praise himself . " But you know I 'm different , Mike . " " Know ! I only know how you behave and how you live . " Burr whistled softly . " My , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ' That 's more of a general judgment about me than a disagreementover campaign tactics . " Mike turned away from him and , in a muffled voice , said , " Never mind that . Stick to the campaign . " " Okay . Willing , Mike . " Silence . Although there were no lights in the store , the street lamp and their intensely focussing eyes put a glare over their conversationwhich made them both feel naked . It was their old argumentabout whether a man had a right to do what he needed to do , or whether he needed most of all to do what society needed him to do , or whether in some combination of this need there was moral worth . Should a man answer his ambition and talents , defined by himself , or should he put himself to useful work , lettingthe sense of duty give shape to talent and ambition ? Does freedom lie outside responsibility , defining it , or is responsibility the only shelter for freedom ? " Did the chicken and egg come first , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chicken ? The omelet or the fricassee ? " Yes , they both agreed that the issue was not simple . No , they had never agreed about the nature of the complexity . Mike thought that , in basing the campaign on ridicule of Mrs. Grant , on emotional appeals for Burr Fuller the Young Liberal Father , on Time for a Change in This District and Back to a Forward-LookingCandidate , Burr was merely a camouflage artist . " Not ideas . Not a program . Just protective coloration  --  but of what ? You need nails and structure , you ca n't hold up a house with paint . "  |p297Burr  agreed . " I have to hide what I really think , " he said . " With every positive statement I make an enemy . It 's true that this way I bother the liberals , the ADA , the UAW intellectuals , but they 'll vote for me anyway . They have no choice . That 's nobodyimportant , that 's a few thousand . Anyway , they 've got nobodyelse . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , they want to laugh and maybe sneer a little , sweetly , and think about what a nice pretty lady is Laura Fuller , and see their big nice brother in good old Burr , Friend of the People of This District . " Mike 's mouth was working . " Now do n't say How silly at me . Mrs. Grant gave us something with her Hen Robin speech . Why , the lady may contribute to every goddamn church fund in the district , but if they walk into the voting booths , and they 're all alone in there , you know , and something in their elbows says Mrs. Grant is half senile , she 's gaga , she 's a joke  --  something jogs their elbows  --  " " Okay , you have my vote , Burr , if that 's what you 're talking for . You have full possession of my elbow . But I do n't like a campaign fought that way . In this paper I have to say what you think about policy , even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a movement of friendship and impatience , Burr reached forward to touch Mike 's shoulder . " Look here . Look , Mike . If I can take our ideas to Washington and have a few years to settle into office , people around here will get used to me . They 'll accept an education if they do n't know they 're getting it . They 'll learn  --  I 'm not contemptuous of the people  --  " " The way you say that . The People . If they do n't know they 're getting it . The folks . All right , Burr , what are those ideas of yours , besides getting Mrs. Grant out and Burr Fuller in ? " " I do n't think this is the time to discuss that , Mike . You 're the one who 's raising the big absolute oratory . But listen , voters are naturally backward , they vote either habit or impulse or desperation , they 're not desperate this year and they want to vote corn/fortable , that means either habit or impulse . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years of Mrs. Grant . I 've got to force them . Give me a chance , Mike , let me run a campaign that has a chance  --  " " No wonder the Party people do n't fight you . They do n't care . You 're their Young Blood , but you 've got tired blood already . " You learn too easy , Burr . " Burr flushed . He had argued with Mike for years , but never beforeagainst this deep strain of contempt from his friend . Somethinghad changed ; something was changing between them . Mike was the sentimentalist at thirty-five  --  books used to be cleaner and sweeter ; girls used to have firmer flesh ; my feet used not to hurt ; friends were purer . Which is to say : Mike had a mouth already beginning to drop at the corners , and to droop about Burr . " Mike , this is no way to talk to me  --  " " Go ahead , get mad , Burr . That would be honest at least . You need to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in secret long enough , you get to be secret even from your-self . " Hit . Burr looked away to a corner of the darkened store . He let Mike see that he recognized the truth in his words , and Mike relented , saying , " I 'm sorry . You know I talk this way because we 're old friends . Only because I think you 've got more than I have , I know it , Burr . It 's true . I hate to see you heading wrong . Burr looked from the dusty corner to the window . He watched the strolling shadows on the street , stragglers taking the air . He wanted to walk . " I 'm sorry , Burr . " Burr looked at his friend again , and caught in the half light an expression of shock and anguish on Mike 's face . The man was willingto take it all back . Mike could not stand for him to be hurt ; Mike did not want to be right . Thirty-five o'clock , very late andp299lonely on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen with misery . Burr recognized that he was using his silence and his hurt itself as a weapon to force Mike to retract ; there was an impulse to continue with policy ; training ; but he heard his own voice break it , break toward communication with his friend , and with pride and gratitude listened to himself . " Go on . I want to hear all you came to tell me . " " I 've said it mostly . I guess you 've said your answer , too . You want to get to be Burr Fuller . You want to be your own hero . You want to get elected . " " Do n't you want that ? " " Yes , but ... " " Yes , but I wanted it first ! Of course . But do n't worry about me , Mike , I wo n't turn bad , not the way you think . Do I look like a demagogue to you ? " He stared at Mike and made Mike examine him anew . He was slender , quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , not a demagogue , " Mike said . " You lie awake too much . But you can be tricky , anyway , and that 's what I 'm talking about . I do n't think you 're a demagogue , how silly , I just think you 're too much of a modern man . Not sneaky , but quite a little bit tricky . You want too much to be promoted . You 're not a supersalesman . You just want to get all the Chiclets out of the machine . " " Then what advice are you trying to give me ? " " What I 'm saying . No advice . You do n't need more advice , Burr , but . . . Do n't  --  do n't you feel there 's something more than advice in what I 'm telling you ? " In that instant , Burr knew that there was something much more , and from the caressing tone of Mike 's voice , the pleading and distracted hurt love of it , he received faint signals . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with Barbara . It was a warning about more than Mrs. Grant 's Hen Robin speech . Tenderness . Anger . Mike was carrying too much , and hep300was straggling toward an odd , impossible easing of the burden  --  vagueness . Burr switched on the three-way lamp which was a campaigngift from Howard Credit Stores ( teamster troubles last year ) . " What ? " he asked , peering into Mike 's face . " What what ? " " What more ? I do n't know what you 're accusing me of , but I 've done nothing yet . " " Yet , " Mike said . " Then you 've done . " Burr tried to make a joke of it . " The wish is only father to the decd . It 's not identical with it . And anyway , I 'm no criminal that you should cross-examine me like this  --  and without naming the accusation . " " Who is doing the examination ? You 're defending yourself too much , Burr . I never said you 're a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly prissy phrase . " You like big words about yourself , Burr . But all the same , if you 're judging crimes  --  or sins  --  it depends what deed and what wish . Some wishes go very far toward being deeds . " " Okay . Okay . " Burr shook his head stubbornly ; he would wait . He said dryly : " Then please describe along practical lines the implicationsof what you 're telling me . That you do n't want to poke fun at Mrs. Grant ? That you want me to be more specific in my campaign program ? Is that what this secret meeting in the dark is all about ? " " Yes , it 's only about principle , merely principle , " Mike said , suddenly as dry , hot , and secret in his anger as Burr ; and his long , ungainly , stretching stride , which Burr had hundreds of times watched so fondly and now somehow found hateful , put him at the door . " I 'll have more to say to you later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . His face was swollen and yellow with sick anger . Burr shrugged . There were more important matters than friends turning sour . There was Laura , Mark , Dan . There was Barbarap301and the campaign . There was the arc of his life  --  even if sections were missing and the shapeliness broken , his imagination completedthe pattern . There was Barbara to save him . But with his hand on the telephone to call her , he lifted his hand as if it were a separate weight and stopped . It was like his suicidal hand on the stove in the Army . He could not talk with Barbara at this moment . Mike was a friend and he needed him . Ile needed not to lose him . Mike 's friendship had long given him a sense that he was right , that he was heading right  --  that matter of pride which Laura had not given him , that therefore even his sons could not give him . He had taken too much of it from himself . Mike was a part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clings to the past because he has nothing to put in its place . Trying very hard to put the present there , to put future time in its place , Burr still very much needed Mike . Whether he wanted or not , he would have to fight with Mike and fight for their old friendship . It meant that he needed to followMike into his lonely byways of judgment and test , example and demand . He had neglected his old friend . Perhaps it could be reduced to that . Tomorrow , tomorrow . And now he would call Barbara , whispering her name into the telephone . " Barbara ? It 's Burr , honey . "  |p305HE  AWAKENED BEFORE DAWN WITH A SMALL DROP OFblood on his lip . The sound of the horse 's hoofs clop-clopping on the street , and the chink of the milkman 's bottles in his wire container : and came fully awake and of course there were no longer milkmen with milkcarts . Childhood was over ; the milkmanwho served that cart was dead . The sound faded . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile moved his arms slowly , so as not to disturb Laura heavily sleeping by his side , and crossed his hands between his head and the pillow . It was his posture for morning thinking . Ile began to think and feel when he went into the position , chin up , eyes to the ceiling , as it occurred to him to make love when he went into another position . Then he noticed the drop of blood on his lip . He saw it , a thick purplish bead , as clearly as if he were peering down into his own face . He did not know where it came from  --  a purplish clotting precipitation on his lip . No , not a fall of blood , an extraction . He puzzled back to his dreams . No , nothing there . He looked at Laura , her face sweetly softened by sleep , troubled , a face vaguely boyish , like his sons , with her hair pulled back by rubber bands . He felt the weight of the blood on his lip . IIe smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care of privacy ; it could awaken her ; and also he did not want to disturb the hardening swift little bead of blood . He took it onto his finger . It broke . He wiped it onto his handkerchief . It disappeared ; it was now merely stain . When Burr was a boy , he had climbed out the window , dropped to the ground in his pajamas , and run to ask Al , the milkman ,  |p306if  he could feed his horse . It had been a great effort to keep from eating the lumps of sugar the night before . He had kept them in the pocket of his pajamas and they had pressed against his breast as he turned in his sleep . Al had said Yes , sure , go ahead , boy . The horse had nuzzled him in his pajamas , licked his fingers , and he had stood barefoot on the five o'clock pavements of a suburbansummer morning , dreaming of feeding sugar to horses while he fed sugar to a horse . Now he moved his lips silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said his name to himself in order to dream who he was . Al was dead , no one in the whole world remembered Al 's horse , he was nearly thirty-five years old now , he had a wife and two children , he wanted to be a congressman , he thought he loved a girl named Barbara . " Burr , " he said . " Fuller , " he said . He lay there stiffly , without moving , letting his wife get her sleep , while he tried to join himself in his skin . Lying awake at night in the outsize bed he shared with Laura , shared for love and shared mostly for loneliness , Burr held to the emptiness of his secret inaccessible places . He was unjoined there . He slept with his wife when he wanted it ; he slept with his wife when she looked at him in a certain way which he recognized ( lashes darkening eyes , limbs shyly slow ) . They signaled each other , but did not unite in desire . Love is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new can opener . Sex is consumed by eager , advertised wives ; successful , simultaneous , the reward for virtue ( like a nice house ) , and failure in the ideal is a prestige lack , a shame ( like living in the wrong neighborhood ) . Consequently these women feel a driving impatience , an anger and thrill of mighty assertion , they tell what to buy and when , they try to rule performance ; but no soft sweet relish in pleasure , no languor . They long for sweet pleasure and languor . Laura fancied herself best as an electric powerhouse of drawing strength , working with controlling power ; and when she did notp307feel the powerhouse in her , she had a headache , punishment for being a woman , or took a sleeping pill , punishment to man for being male and to sons for being merely children , born of woman . The thick mutter in her head next morning was their fault . Yet she knew , she knew she longed for something else . Laura and Burr participated in lovemaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not join , and so lie needed this early morning wakefulness which gave him a sense of being joined peacefully someplace , at least in his sense of privacy . And yet there was little in it which he could explain even to himself : creak of the house and of his ambitions ; slow stirring of day and of his desires ; early whisper and chirp of birds , the early regrets . He thought that it would be good to put these mornings into words , something he could tell Mike now , someday tell his sons . But then they would be only words . It would be merely friendship , the material of intimacy which makes up the material of friendship ; and thus useful objects again , words ; or memories , gossip , talk over milk and graham crackers , notes of a doting father , words . In present susceptibility and hope he clung to the perfect inutility of this stark morning wakefulness . Before beginningthe day he took the strange stolid satisfaction of looking into blank mystery , marveling there . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuller . Was he at worship of himself ? No , no . And yet it was useful ; it fired him more than sleep . He believed these hours to be a large part of the secret of his vitality despite the draining tension with Laura . If Barbara was hope , love , and office his ambition , and his sons some unnamable stable joy and expectation , these morning times were a gathering of himself into himself  --  so fragmented were his needs of love , work , and sense of meaning on earth . The sleepless early morning powered him through the hullaballoo of political meetings . Chairing discussions , joshing newspapermen , arguing and marshaling , using menp308as tools , he stood private from the day each morning and refused to think of himself as a tool . He was not a purpose . He was a person  --  or so the morning at dawn helped him believe . Perhaps , Burr decided , the morning at dawn ( or whatever other time he gives himself ) is the way the public man must protect himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , display , eyes peeking everywhere . He must hide for strength and go away in caves where constituents can not follow , where advisors can not pursue , and even his wife can not penetrate  --  where he is at the same moment absent and present to himself . Here his oratory may be furnished with hoarseness and passion , no matter what he says . Here is time for him , and the stillness of the self outside time . Here his childhood is stored , the milkman lives ; here he is gathered to himself . Burr knew how much he needed to be gathered unto himself . When Laura looked reproachfully at him , he felt the cavities forming in his teeth ; they crumbled under the gaze of her angry , lovely face . ( But what if a wife hurries into the secret cave not to judge but to join ? ) ( But what if his wife is not Laura but that lovely , teasing high spirit ? ) A man , Burr decided , can live without love and privacy : only he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . In the other political way , the man of power gives up his secret places . Unloved , unused to privacy , unskilled in being alone , he becomes the clever hunk of meat , the delight of cameramen , a master of multitudes by being nothing but the twitch that best suits the crowd 's own jerks and quavers . The leader then is no longer a principle of organization ; he is the principle which expresses disorganizationmost eloquently . Not Burr ! He felt the movement of his teeth against teeth . ( Ah ! A pierced lip and a drop of blood ! )  |p309No  , even poor Warren Gamaliel Harding found a girl to try to make that solemn hairy handsome face human . Burr knew that this did not save Harding . A girl does not bring love like a gift to be unwrapped : nor can the man bestow it either : so love does not save the world or even save itself . Tumescence is a universal blessing ; detumescence a universal release from blessings . Without work and a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Burr needed Barbara because the child 's morning at dawn is in the past wholly , an absolute longing loneliness , proper only to childhood . The child can contain his entire future within himself . The man needs to print his past on someone else 's body ; and someone to be writ large upon him , too ; and then to go ahead . Of course , of course ! Why look elsewhere ? He had bitten his lip in his sleep . Another salt drop had formed already . Lonely , he needed Barbara . The world must stand away and let him . He turned over , touched his wife , and abstractly wished her well as he fell into that stubborn heavy doze which precedes the jangle of the alarm . In the other bedroom his eldest son , Dan , wide-eyed and forevermystified by the pale early after-dawn morning , was peering out the window , worried and alone because he had not yet seen his friend Pete , the newsboy who delivered the morning Free Press in time for grownup breakfasts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME ; when there is love , there is no first time . They found each other .. They refound each other.  |p310He  accused her of being a nice girl . " Is that why so sad ? Is that why so reluctant ? " " Yes , " Barbara said thoughtfully , " I think I 'm a nice girl . And that 's why I ca n't help myself . Rent a hotel room . " " Tonight ? " She smiled wryly . " No , a week from yesterday , what do you think . Of course tonight , silly . Hurry ! Do you think I know how to wait any better than you do ? " They came together like trains on a complicated switching system . He picked the largest hotel in town ; they entered through different entrances and rose in different elevators ; he got to the room a few seconds before her and they met behind the door . There was on her face a look of abstraction and willing sacrifice , as if , since decisions were already made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet there was trouble on her face . " Sweet , sweet girl , " he said , stroking her hair , her face , her ears while she remained unmoving and silent . The troubled corners of her mouth were pulled down . Her eyes were veiled by a thick brush of wet dark lash . He stood by the door kissing her , suddenlyterrified by her chilled silence , as if she might abruptly turn and flee . Ile looked at the door to lock it . " You had better let me go a moment , " she said . " Stop . Do n't touch me . " He moved as if to free her . She stood with her back to thehotel door ( SOME OF THE MANY SERVICES OF OUR HOTEL ) ... and her stillest silence told him simply to wait , wait . He remembered once smelling a secret fire in a summer house . He searched everywhere , fearing disaster , finding neither smoke nor fire , smelling it anyway , and it was only the moths ' wings as they collided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings burning . She frowned and breathed shallowly . Her own inner battles were not won either.  |p311Suddenly  she showed her teeth . " But you 've got all your clothes on , " she said reproachfully , and with fierce urgency began to pull at his tie and tear at the buttons of his shirt . " We 'll buy a new one in the lobby of the hotel , "  --  and abruptly her joyous peal of laughter rang out and dispelled the memory of moths ' wings . They met and kissed as if they had been running downhill against each other . Then they separated . There was window business , light business , bathroom business , to which they tended like an assault team dividing the work . Then there was nothing to be divided and they came toward each other again . His hand was invented for breast and crisping nipples ; he swarmed over her , above , around , about , below , between ; and she met his swarming to make of it dance . He would have liked to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond life  --  but even at the moment of consummation in pleasure beyondpleasure , experience beyond experience , he knew that it was not so . Detroit with his picture on billboards whirled about the center where he lay with Barbara . Laura and his sons were someplace out there . At the very instant of deepest oblivion he felt a sharp rasp at foolish essential Northern places , at his knee and at his elbow , and understood the simple fact that today does not undo yesterday , does not absolutely determine tomorrow . In plain fact , he was terrified . She smiled and touched her lips over his face in the half-light of the evening through blinds drawn over the window of theirspinning skyscraper . During that first time of too much anticipatedlovemaking , he feared that he had made love like a loverling  --  somuch allowed , no more now  --  but on appeal he wouldallow himself more , and much more , until he might wear out hishistory in the torments of delighted flesh . He sought the privacyof forgetting who he was . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find that , absolutely content now ,  |p312he  was gratefully caressing her foot with his toes  --  just as he sometimes did with Laura . Ile was shocked awake as if a noise had gone off in his head . Barbara opened her eyes as if she too had heard it . Now it was her turn to move away and wait . Slowly , as if he had willed it , the city noises floated up from Detroit . He could almost hear the hum and angry whir of speed on the expressways . And then slowly , as if he had willed it , the city noises diminished and there was nothing but the world of his will and Barbara 's wish . They lay together breathing shallowly . At the end of her breast rose a fat bean , a grape sweeter than grapes , growing to his touch as if he were the sun . He whirled like the fiery sun , drawing life out of heat . He rose again , and his face inflamed by an entranced fury , her face grave and sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung , they strained together , they fell apart once more . And again , exhausted brutes , lay staring into each other 's eyes as if to read the truth . HE WAS INVITED TO AN ENDLESS MEETING HELD BY ANegro settlement group . He swore to himself as he fidgeted in his chair on the stage that he would be quick and go . Barbara was waiting . It was a Baptist church , but on the stained glass window was the star of David . It had been a synagogue for thirty years earlier ; real estate values had converted it as no argument for brotherhood ever could . Though Burr was stiff with waiting , when he got up to speak he felt limber and free and talked until he raised an ovation . " When I was a boy I drove through the Southland  --  you know it , friends . I saw those people , maybe some of you were  |p313They  were waiting . They were waiting for something to happen . Some of them came North to wait . Some of you are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine , but some of you are waiting . There 's an old story about that . It seems that when God created the earth and the sky and the people on it , he made the mistake of asking the white man first what he wanted . The white man said , Power and dominion over all . ' Granted , said the Lord . And then the Lord said to the colored man , What will you have ? ' But the colored man thought and there was n't anything left along the line of power and dominion . So lie said , I 'm just waiting . ' But he has waited long enough , and this is the time now , after the great upheavals of the past one hundred years since Lincoln first ... " He got his applause . A line formed to shake his hand . " Do n't forget the national ticket , too , " he said perhaps a hundred and fifty times . LAURA : SHE HAS GREAT SECRECY WITHIN HER SQUALLING , nagging demands . Barbara : she is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Me : private , secret , private even to myself . There is a place someplace , darkness within my angry will . For what should I bite my nails and make uneasy my dreams if not love ( happy love ) and work ( good work ) ? There is too much duty in the world . But whatever can I give my sons ?  |p314THEY  MET EVERY DAY , PUBLICLY ON CAMPAIGN BUSINESSand secretly on secret business , very much secret even to themselves . The campaign went well . Burr had never been so careless of success , so sure of it . Whether or not he won this time , he was on his way ; there was another election in two years . They wanted new photographs and he had them taken just after leavingBarbara one afternoon . His face in the photograph seemed very young , with the cheekbones and the chinline strong and the eyes dark , large , and warm . It was the heat of fever , and the boyishness came partly of the emaciation of fever . He was marvelouslyill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laura in some fading despairing way , and for Mike 's respect . But in the pictures he was a happy swain  --  they gave him away to himself and he did n't like to see Dan coolly studying them . He was more self-seeking than any ordinary determined officeseeker . In fact , he cared little about the office itself , so long as he knew his own direction . He went to Barbara one afternoon depressed because Mike had passed him in the hall of the County Building and only nodded , not breaking his stride , as if he were too busy to talk . But Barbara had tanned arms , and the white glimpse under the sleeves of her blouse was like the trapped miner 's discovery of sky , and he only wanted to tell her that he loved her . " I want to tell you something , " he said . " I 'm busy , " she said , fleeing to the kitchen of her new apartment . " Let me cook , then talk . " The wifely gaiety both reassured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys to bed . But when Laura heard the proverb telling of the three things that drive a man from home , ap315leaky roof , a smoky chimney , and a scolding wife , all she thought of doing was to call the roofer and brick up the chimney . He stretched his legs and called out to Barbara , " Bet I know what you 're making . " " Guess then . " He was absolutely certain that it would be roast of beef , wild long rice , black pudding , lark pasties , pears and comfits , medlars and peeled nuts , wafers , Sally-Forths for dessert , glazed spices , sweets and sours , cinnamon , cloves , ginger , bland pearls and black coffee brewed thick as syrup . . . . Or so it seemed to him , fat and swollen with desire . What did food matter ? They could nourish themselves on graham crackers in the plenteous dark . The lovemakinganimal is omnivorous . Then he would hurry home to wake up his sons for a short sleepy chat before tucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust him awake . Yes , yes , something particular this time . A particular sharp dream . Yes , prickled and tickled by a feather . He had dreamed of being stripped , stripped dirty , dangling broken feathers  --  the fraternity party . Seen by Laura and Lucille . Seen by Barbara . Seen dancing in all his weakness by the great world of women . " Only a dream . " Whatever had happened to Allen to destroy him utterly ? To make him so like all men ? ( Most men. )  |p316HE  WAS VERY AWARE AS HE SPOKE OF THE GREAT MENsitting behind him . He wondered if he had developed that habit of orators , rotating the rump clockwise , counterclockwise , which made it difficult for the man seated to his rear to be uplifted by the words . To the front , jawing marvels ; to the rear , the anxious scat of pants . He was saying , since this was an association of alumni federations , " I look for a wider appreciation of American culture on every level , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandburg or W. K. Kelsey , one of the best newspaperwriters in the world , admired internationally , and he 's right here in Detroit . But culture is not a matter of artists and intellectuals , it consists in meaningful contact between citizens of all ... " Abruptly , while the crowd lay broody and content in its chairs , he was dreaming of something to make this speech wake it up . A crazed Lebanese grocer ran up to attack him with a broken bottle . A truck exploded outside . The chandelier fell . He thought of a wonderful pointed comment which would at the same time please everyone. " ... of all races , creeds , and national origins , " he said instead . Then Burr sat in parades so slow that all the automatic transmissionsof the volunteers with open cars had to be overhauled afterwards . The democrats of Chicago Boulevard and Seven Mile Road made the supreme sacrifice by driving their convertibles for twenty miles at a speed which General Motors had never intended . The parched throats of the paraders , those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhauled with beer and pastilles . Burr sat in committees with men with whom he had intense , intimate conversations about world problems while he tried to fixp317their faces in his memory with tags : Michael Campo  --  yellow roots of teeth , jug ears , Eau do Cologne . . . " Mister Campo , I could n't agree with you more . Population has taken a tremendouspostwar upsurge , the children do n't have parks , I 'm thinking of my own boys too , we should blacktop empty lots as temporary playgrounds . " " In time of crisis  --  " " It strikes me as a brilliant emergency measure , Mister Campo . " Campo : roots of teeth , ears , sweetish smell , executive of asphalt company , prime contributor to local campaigns . Introduced by Gander of Wayne University . Tendency to think I 'm on school board or Board of Parks and Recreation . At higher levels of the campaign atmosphere , Burr sat briefly before bed with the Party 's vice presidential nominee . He took from him the sense of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition which had flared up in him , but like a used light bulb  --  one shake and the filament would break . This was an illusion of temporary fatigue  --  and he marveled at the nutrition of public life in himself and in Kefauver  --  because the next morning , when the man had taken four hours of sleep , they drove together to the airport and he was fresh , thick , alert , hot again . A light bulb is only a mechanical tool , but a man contains a filament which can feed on air and joy . Clopping his dry mouth , rubbing his knuckles , taking air , the local Party 's esteemed guest asked the name from last night of that man interested in the welfare , safety , and social adjustment of children . " Michael Campo , " Burr said . " Thinks cement gives brutal ideas , fallen arches . Children should play on asphalt . " " Fifteen thousand dollars to the county chest , five to National , " said Ed McKinley . " Will do better . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time , " he remarked . Returning from the airport , McKinley allowed himself an easyp318moment of contemplation . He grumbled and lit a cigar as if he had been waiting for the chance to combine these two pleasures . " He 's no fun , that man , " he said . " I do n't aim to work my ass off for Adlai either , but you get the idea he could be fun . " Burr replied something , but was mostly busy making mental notes for future dealings with Mac : Be fun . Tickle if have to . He must finish my campaign with no ass . Arid that , he decided later , is how we make our two party system great  --  with our seats . We are not content merely to sit on them . We work them off , we scratch and rotate them when we speak ( rotate hard at open air meetings , gentle before studio microphones ) . We also use our hands until they ache with grippingand shaking . We also use our mouths until the smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age of machines at all : the body is driven in mechanical ways as if the body can do it all alone . And then the voter stands up at the voting machine and votes his pocketbook , his newspaper , his church , his father , his company , his union . McKinley 's wornout tail and gastric stomach do n't count at all . Neither does Keef 's remembering of Campo 's name . Mrs. Sally Hopkins Benson will vote for me out of sentimentalityand pride , because she told all the neighbors how we used to do our home work together , but I do n't think even little Sally 's good will can win the election for me . So when we sweep up the litter on November 5 , we wonder why we bothered to hand them the little cards with our picture , " War Veteran , " on it . And in two years , four years , six years , we start all over ( " Young Lawyer , Father , PTA Member " ) . The moment of fatigue and discouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapped himself under the chin . I 'll be senator someday , Burr thought , then it 'll be only once every six years.  |p319I  'm not a filament either . A few hours with Mark and Dan and I 'm ready to burn again . Dan was saying , gravely preoccupied while Laura bathed and Burr read to Mark : " I want a clock . I need one . " " Why ? " He looked disgusted because his father did not understand the purpose of clocks . To take apart , silly Daddy . " My sons are not filaments either , Burr thought , smiling and promising him the clock . Campo has interest in black-topped playgrounds . Be more fun for Mac . Clock for Dan . Try remain human possible . THE WAY I LIVE Now : Notes for a Prosecution , by Michael MurrayHow do I live now ? Privacy . The origin of my life  --  privacy out of solitude with silence . I walk privately , I think privately , I love privately ; and I walk very little , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I pity myself or her more . And I know that 's no way to love . Dirty sheets , hurry , regrets , work for the maid . And that is the way I love her . What am I ? A bachelor , a lawyer , a brief-writer with one deaf ear and an old man 's way of pushing myself out of a chair . A formerfighter pilot , a former bright young man , a former simplemindedand pure-souled campus bum . Of course I needed Burr to give me some zip . Why have I had to follow him so long , in so many ways ? And yet I have become deaf to him , like an old dog . Jealousy . Love. judgment . He 's right . He thinks I 'm jealous , I judge . I am , I do . Yet he hasp320no truer friend , just as he has no truer enemy . The soul 's sweet innocence conies of following its own sweet will to goodness . Not me . I made vital mistakes . I was not sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched goodness , sour at last I have found love . And there 's no good in it sour . Resent . I have to keep reminding myself : " I think , therefore I am "  --  proving that I exist and the world exists . Burr lives out his way : " I think , therefore I am filled with awe "  --  proving that he is a wonder , the world is a place of marvels . He does n't have clear ideas , does he ? All right , then he does n't have clear ideas . Do my clearer ideas give me the truth , enable me to live by the truth ? Knowledge is good . I know what it is to be dead , but I do n't learn from my knowledge . Tonight I awaken as if self-thrown from sleep , afraid of it and of what my dreams will give me ; I do n't dare sleep  --  the worst insomnia . I lie stiff with legs twitching . I sit up , switch on the light , blink , my bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have a sick emptiness in my belly , do not believe in anyone though her perfume fills the room . I have kept the window shut to guard it . I get up and eat an apple and look at the core , browning ; I was not hungry , the core tells me , that was n't what you needed . I open the window . ... Do I need to study Spanish at the Berlitz ? Learn dancing under an anonymous name ? What else can I need ? Some men hold their youthfulness too late , Burr maybe , but me , I rushed to give it up too willingly . Shut the window again . Impacted wax in the bad ear after my cold . Must see the doctor . There 's the mechanical way of sucking it out , also drops , a diluted detergent . Years ago I could have called Burr now , we would have a walk . He 'd groan and climb out of bed and meet me halfway and tease me until I could try sleep again , easily . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . But would n't it be foolish at my age to huntp321up the old friend that way ? Like when my mother used to give us two handfuls of cookies for our walks in the park . Jaundice , thy lips , nervous pounding of the heart , I sit here at my lamp  --  jealousy , love , judgment . Love is in the happy grasp of every jumping Jack and Jane but me . That 's what my jealousy and my apple core tell me . I think of the undeserving lovers all over the earth , sleeping in each other 's arms , deserving . I turn off the light and fear the disasters of the dark , age , kidney trouble , coarsening skin on the joints , loss of my other ear . I who flew a P-47 now fear heights , grow dizzy in an elevator . My had ear . I punish my body because it has not given me joy . The crisis of no harbor , of drifting . I punish my body . I think of making a trip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that greedy insistence on pleasure in the smell of every plane tree , the way the girls shift their hips to make themselves comfortable in a chair ; they purse their lips to listen . Will I be as young as when a flier ? But even then , with all my rows of ribbons , the girls liked the happy groundcrew corporalsbetter . That girl I paid in Paris . . . Premonitions . I suspect disaster . It makes me sneeze . Burr sneezes from taking too deep a sniff from the pepper . I hold my breath until there is nothing but sneeze in it for me . I want to crawl into her arms to breathe , to fit my body to hers , to have children . And so I think of a girl I paid in Paris because she wanted to kiss me , I think really wanted to . It was the time . Could n't stay with me either . What right does Burr have to enjoy all his common blessings ? Earned them ? No . His sons could as easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . I covet to be taken care of by my neighbor 's wife . Everything leads to love , but I am held back by my dream of being held back . I seize handfuls of air and grab myself forward , like some animal in a tunnel , eating its way . I think Burr said : A life of noisy desperation . But who knows what he knows , or if he knows anything ? For example : Does he know what love is or only what it feels likep322to be in love ? Ile does what he wants ; he does everything ; abominations . But he made Laura miserable ! He had no right ! He should have known how to make her happy ! I am not a good man . It makes me no less angry that Burr has failed me , his wife , and himself , and does not admit it . I did not have to be good when I flew my missions over Germany . I do n't have to be good now . Just need to line up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hate myself ? Am I a conscript or a volunteer ? Oh my ear . I think it 's infected . MIKE HAD FORMED THE HABIT OF LOOKING AT HIM , NOTat him but at his clothes , just looking  --  saying nothing or as little as he could get away with  --  looking and then saying nothing and looking away . He seemed to have a conversation with Burr 's clothes in which Burr did not participate . When Burr cleared his throat , Mike started as if caught , his nose turned red , he bent back to what he was doing . Now , however , Mike ran a smear from his copy pencil down the editorial which Burr had written for this week 's issue of the FULLER FOR CONGRESS campaign newspaper . He gave up interrogation of Burr 's seersucker jacket and bow tie . He seemed ready to speak . He swiveled back in his chair and put his hands behind his head in the gesture of Burr 's own morning meditations . Uncanny , Burr thought , how we 've picked up each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red when I 'm worried . Mike finished with Burr 's face and continued studying it in his text . The editorial would be printed in boldface type , in double columns , under the heading " Burr Fuller Writes to His Friends . " Mike skimmed it rapidly , with a tight little smile , and Burrp323guessed that he was looking for the familiar " Hen Robin " phrase about Mrs. Grant . Since he did not find it , he read the pages again carefully . When he had finished he sighed , took his feet off the desk , and said , " Okay , but it does n't say what you 're for or against this week either . All it says is that according to you you 're a good guy . " This is a campaign , Mike . You do n't think I say it subtly enough ? You revise . The purpose of all this is to win an election . " " I know you want in . But why should anybody else want you in ? What 's there in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Burr ? " " You know what I stand for , Mike . We 've been talking politics for years . If you did n't know , why were you so enthusiastic about my running in the first place , about getting Mrs. Grant out and me in ? " Mike 's worried , sleepless , bachelor 's eyes , with their fine fabriccrinklednetwork of lines , blinked as if to lubricate the dry red rims . He looked ill , old . His suit was too big on him , and the diminished body was hot under broadcloth . When he moved and his jacket swung open , Burr could see the dark stain under his arms . " Oh I 'm sorry , " Burr wanted to say , " you have n't been well and I did n't notice . " But he felt a warning to silence , to wait for Mike , and Mike was taking time because the knot of anger within him could not easily be untangled ; he gasped dryly , choked with fury : " You 're trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed , gone far away from friendship . He was again busy looking at Burr 's clothes , not at Burr . The only way to take it was as dryly as it had been given . He said merely : " Where ? " " You 're trying to get there too fast , Burr . " This time it was to the naked Burr inside , not the summer suit . Mike 's habit was to speak in a hoarse , repressed , violent voice , a falsetto bass which made Burr pity him because of the effort it cost . It had a secret.  |p324Its  secret was that it became shrill , almost feminine , when he lost control . Mike was afraid of his own violence , of his impulse to obey and of his violent , feminine protest against obedience . Too fat ! shrilled out the second time like a woman . They sat again in the deserted after-hours office of the FULLER FOR CONGRESS headquarters , as he had sat with Barbara , as he had often sat with Mike before . They talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campaign and their disagreements about it ; but primary disagreements , the issues of honor and responsibility , not tactics , were now being uncovered between them . Mike 's honor had always been a thing which made Burr smile . Once he had accused Mike of being so moral that he refused water with his meals : he felt it his duty to use nothing but his own saliva to lubricate the food down . He guarded the Right and the Just as if it existed in a state of siege , under continual attack . Burr was opposed to declaring a state of emergency  --  he distrusted Committeesof Public Safety . He had always defended his American carelessness , his spendthrift freedom with moral virtue . About love and friendship they had never really disagreed . Never before . They came solemnly , as they sometimes had before , to bedrockmatters between them . Oil depletion allowances , foreign aid , public housing , disarmament negotiation , hydrogen weapons , the United Nations were here the manifest symptoms of somethinghappening to their old friendship . It occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he immediately relegatedthe political questions to their place as symptoms , just as Mike did . Private responsibilities took precedence over public policy . In few words , with shy looks and furious smiles , tobacco teeth and reddened eyes , with that phrase trying to get there too fast , Mike was telling him about opportunism and judgment , about a distancing from people , about responsibility and its failures.  |p325And  in the darkness again , Burr was saying , " There are some people who see no possibilities but the one they live by . That 's you . And so they are efficient as far as they go . There are some who see too many possibilities , and so go off half-cocked , and inefficient  --  " " You ? Inefficient ? " The voice was under control now , back in the trained registers of its determined hoarseness . " I improvise . Yes . " " Mere appetite . " With scorn . " Mere ambition . " " All right , grant it . I 'm ambitious , Mike . You 've always known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay to desire ? I have it on authority  --  Napoleon . " Mike relaxed slightly , unclasped his fists . Burr chose authority , and the most unsavory ones , when he was backed up against his conscience . " I guess he 's pretty good testimony for ambition . " " Yes , Napoleon . He would n't let himself be crowned by God 's will . He took the crown from the Pope 's hand and put it on his own head . " They sat near each other , talking to each other , but looking out into the rundown Detroit summer night  --  black street , black buildings , amber industrial sky . " You really want to be Napoleon , " Mike asked , " in his threecorneredhat ? How silly . And crazy , as every last Napoleon always was ? " " Sure I admire that . Crazy . Thanks , " Burr said . Ile felt a blood rush of both sympathy and hatred because he recognized his old friend suddenly in a set of familiar gestures  --  squinting , sniffing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borne bravely , and usually Burr hurried to his help when he saw it . They had done homework together at college . It was a signal he had learned . But what Mike was saying he heard as one word , Mike 's banner : " Principles ... "  |p326Burr  began to laugh , an angry , false , oratorical laugh . " More people arc destroyed for principle than ever were for what you call lack of principle , what I call ambition , love , desire , adventure , play . You 're so principled about love you ca n't even get married ! You have to find it perfect , that ideal girl , that divine object of God 's absolute pains . " Mike was darkening even in the half light . Burr knew he was hurting , but he was hurt himself and thus striking out . " Why , " Burr asked softly , " why .. ? Never mind , I 'm sorry for what I just said , Mike . " " Say more . " " Just this : Why put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Machiavelli or Napoleon either . We 've been friends , we  --  you know how I feel about things . " " Does that mean we ca n't tell the truth to each other ? " Does he know about Barbara ? Burr abruptly asked himself . He peered intently into the darkness . Was it that he suspected something , and was angry for this , and therefore he was not telling the truth either , because he kept talking about the campaign when he was really angry because of Barbara ? And what gave him the right ? Where did Mike think he was going ? Who had appointedhim ? Friendship was something that had grown up between them ; it carried no judicial powers . Even as he searched vainly like this , like a moth being singed and protesting against the light , attacking with his diminished wings , spinning down , he knew that there is no friendship withoutjudgment . In some way Mike had the right  --  providing he judged not as a magistrate but as a friend . Sweating solemnly in his dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not think of cotton and dacron suits , Mike gave off a bittersweet , faintly ecclesiastical incense . Inquisitor . He would burn me for my own good , Burr thought . He looked at this thin-lipped man and tried , squinting , to remember the solemnly humorous collegep327boy . Mike was aging fast . Burr shivered because it meant that he too was heading irreversibly into age , and Mike was the living sign of it , as Laura , with her invincible pique , could not be , as Burr himself , with his stubborn mobilization of energy , could not reveal it to himself . Self-love and brutal self-judgment  --  Burr lay on a rack of his own contrivance . In their various ways , Laura , Barbara , and Mike gave him support for self-love while they multiplied the risks of self-judgment . Mike said , " I always envied your self-confidence . But now I have to tell you it 's gone had . It 's become the sin of pride . " " Sin begins for you , Mike , with your telling me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mortal sin if your truth happens to be a lie , and merely your pride in action , or some worse motive . " What did he know ? What was he hiding ? " Virtue does n't come from telling the truth , and not even directly from doing good . We make too much of what we do in America , day-by-day . It 's what we are that finally matters . Being what we are is the final way of doing things . " " Philosophy ! "  --  with the dry angry smile . " When you get abstract , Burr , I pull my ear and listen for what you 're hiding . " Maybe we 're both hiding , Burr admitted to himself . " I could say you drive me to abstraction , friend . You taught me . I avoid it most of the time , but I 'm grateful for your teaching . " Mike nodded , assenting wryly . " Yes . I suppose it 's the language I understand . My father was a preacher . But still you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burr felt hot , thick , unaccustomed male tears searching for permissionin his eyes . His sinuses were blocked . I-Ic too wanted to sneeze . This man , his opponent , his friend , was very determined . He was sad and wanted to hurt . Yes , yes , he despises me ! In his pride he hates me ! And the tears were ready because it made no difference how Mike came to this point , for pity , for envy , even for justice in hisp328abstract appraisal of the right . What mattered was this : " You are my friend ? " Burr asked wonderingly , thinking : Somehow I have lost my friend . " If I were n't your friend I would n't bother to talk to you this way . It would n't make any difference to me . " In the darkness of that temporary place a little haze of light rose ; headlights passing augmented it , but it did not diminish as they passed ; Burr knew now : It 's Laura , it 's Barbara . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is always that on his mind . And for that his sick sleepless eyes . And cried out : " Bad faith , Mike ! Whatever you think of what I do , I have always been a friend to you . " " I ca n't separate what you do to others from what you do to me . " " Would you turn me over to the police if you knew I had committeda crime ? " " That 's not the point . I 'm not turning you over to anyone . " " No , you would n't . Squeamish . But the way you judge  --  absolutely , that cold way you have  --  and with your love of law , all kinds , moral , statutory , traffic , whatever  --  you should love the laws of consistency . " " You 're not consistent , Burr . Why make rules for me ? " " I do n't try to live by your rules . I 'm just saying what your rules are  --  " He had wept for Mike 's death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked up and croaked hoarsely , " Excuse me . I mean my throat is sore . " Cough , cough . " Burr , let 's just say what we mean , shall we ? " " I 'm asking you . Say . " " Burr , please . You 're being a child . " " About what ? Say it ! " But he understood that Mike knew about Barbara , and that this was gnawing at him as if it were his own sin . Sin would be his word for it , and it was what he meant by " being a child . " You know , his lowered head admitted . I ca n't bear it , said the clenched hands held to his side . The look in his eyes as he slowly raised his head was one of supplication . Burr felt victory in his grasp in this contest with his friend . Anger : it was a weapon seldom to be used , never to be forced , but now it came to him in an easy passionate flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superheated and flushed through his clothes . He felt a painful stickiness at the hairs of one of his hands : Dan had put a gold star on his hand  --  " For being a Good Daddy "  --  and some of the glue must have remained when he peeled it off . He rubbed the back of his hand against his pants , and this frictionagainst the childish gift from his son seemed to provide the last necessary heat to ignite him in fury , saying : " Yes ! Yes ! If there were n't some childishness in me 1 'd be dead by now ! " ( Like you , he did not say to his friend . ) " Yes ! The animals withoutchildhood do n't grow up very much . Just like a child I came to need love , because I was deprived and no friends , no job , no campaign could give it to me . I just wanted a woman , just plain and easy with me , Mike . Somebody . Each clay that went by without giving me someone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone ! " Mike had stood up and was shouting , " What about Laura and the days of her death ? " It was as abrupt as hail . Burr suddenly went cold and his happy fury turned to ice , and then melted , and there were tears in his eyes . " I need someone to love me . " " You need , you need , " Mike said coldly . " Yes . Okay . All right . You judge me then , friend . Yes , Laura is hurt , she 'll be hurt more . Unhappy . Yes , but she does n't know how to be anything else  --  " " With you . " " Perhaps . Yes . Okay . Does n't know how with me , then . " He turned from Mike and blew his nose , and with his face averted ,  |p329involuntarily  smiled at the large wet noise he made . Blowing the nose is always funny , even following tears . His ears rang with a high thin noise . I Ic turned to where Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamp , going to the door . He reached out his hand to touch his sleeve . Mike jumped , afraid that Burr would plead with him , hit him , touch him for violent mercy . Burr smiled at the quick withdrawal and looked at his hand to sec what was wrong with it . Instead of more anger , more tears , he heard himself talking quietly to Mike 's shadow in the door : " It 's all right . Laura 's all right . You 're all right too , I guess . I expect I need . . . " But he would not say Barbara 's name . " I expect I need someone . I guess I should n't expect too much of a human being , but you 're all right for one , Mike . Just go . " " There 's no point in talking any more now . You 're excited , Burr . That 's a good sign . Maybe we 'll talk another time . " " Go . " " I want to see you tomorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go . "  |p330IN  HER HURRY SHE HAD BROKEN A STRAP , AND AS HEpulled off her blouse , lie found the safety pin with which she had hastily pinned herself ready , and the found this eager carelessness very touching , very trusting . I need you now , he had said . Please hurry . She had hurried . " Mike is mad at me  --  " " Sh . I 'm not . Sh . " How did he , all belly , bones , hair , and veins , a crackling knuckle of male flesh and cartilage , ever come to earn this soft , nervous , yielding , loving creature ? How ? In a darkened room again , in the tidal thrust of blood again , imperfect and marvelous always , asp331love must always be . Burr kissed her appendix scar , loving her for her weakness and illness in the past ; it was all she had to show for illness and weakness . She seemed to understand the gesture . She kissed the sunburnt scar behind his ear where , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , she knew enough about him , or her body knew , which is knowledge . The vital centers touched . They must have slept . His eyes flickered open , he shut them again , he opened them to the room . He discovered the wide world over her dozing body . He discovered a tiny mole on her thigh with a little sprout of hair , like eyelashes . He smiled at Barbara , just smiled , smiled until she opened her eyes into his . At last she said , " I want to talk . " Hands hiding her breasts  --  oh-oh , serious talk , thought Burr  --  she got up to open the blinds partway to sunlight . " Yes , serious woman talk , " she said . " I 'm sorry , Burr , but look at me . " " I am . I ca n't get enough of it . " She pulled the sheets up to her chin , smiling , flattered , but undeterred . " Neither can I , not enough of us together , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . Men , " she said , and her face was tired and had a pale bluish wasted place under each eye , and she looked away from him , " men like to pretendthere 's nothing else , but there is for them , too . I 'm going to be just like any other woman now , Burr , exactly . Do n't hate me . " He nodded seriously , earnestly listening , though he knew that he could not give her the answer she wanted to the question she would stop short of asking . " I ca n't help it , " she said , and pulled the sheets tightly about her . " It 's wonderful . It 's not enough . " " Do n't I give you what you  --  do n't I give you enough ? " " Yes , three-quarters devotion . Lots of that . " " How can I give you more ? "  | " how can you ? " she asked . She wanted to drive Laura , Mark , and lean into words between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children with her ; he could not discuss them as problemsiii the way of anything . He ignored them , longed for them , went home to them . He would not reduce them to words now . Flushing , he said , " Is n't my three-quarters more than the all that some men give ? " " Yes , that 's not the point . I want what you can give to me compared with other men 's successes , not their failures . " And she sat up , leaning over him with a loving anger which made him see her long hanging breasts very closely , as if he inhabited their slopes , smelling still of love , hot and purple at the perking nipple which even now again wanted love : " Finally , " she said in a fury with her body 's strength and weakness , " finally three-quarters devotion becomes merely hindquarters devotion . I ca n't help how I feel , it feels , "  --  and she threw her mouth thirstily against his . She seemed to be calling from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But remember what I say , oh , Burr , remember anyway ! Think about it ! " Loving greed never stops this loneliness for longer than the din in an ear echoes . It returns in the body 's exhaustion , and then only the truth remains , color of ashes . " Just what attracts you to me will prevent your staying with me . You want a touch of wildness , but only a touch  --  you like these meetings !  --  and you want mostly your family . " " Yes , I admit  --  " " You 'll never believe I could give you that  --  " " I have it . I have two sons , " he said coolly . " That aside . I do n't want to take that away . I 'm talking about us , not them . Because the wildness came first , you hold back belief in me . " " I 'm a prude , you mean ? The philanderer ? That 's what you make of me  --  I 'm having my fling with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " How could I really ? " And she let the sheet fall forward to show her nakedness , still printed by him . " But I comfort you , I was your first comfort and wildness , and next you either give up and go back to your wife and make do with your unhappiness . Or . Or you 'll find another girl , not me , who will give you what you want from your wife . " " That 's you , Barbara . " " No . And you 'll remember me as a good kid . ' You want your wife  --  different  --  different you want her  --  but you want her . " " I want you . " Flat , final silence . Decision . " No . I 'll take what I can get anyway , Burr . " " Barbary , Barbary , I want you more than anything . " But they knew that this was not the truth . They loved each other , but they both wanted other things . There was nothing they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding hands like platonic lovers . Then he looked at his watch , said that it was late , quickly shuffled into clothes and stuffed his tie in his pocket . She got up with him and sat in a robe , watching . " Good night , " they said shyly to each other . She clung to him , and then when he thought that she had retreated , the door came open again . " Good night , Burr . " " Good night , Barbara . " " Can you smell that spring air ? It 's coming right through the hall . " " Yes . Good night . " " Good night , Burr . "  |p334GRIEF  , GRIEF I NEED . IN THIS BOUNTIFUL AMERICA GRIEFdoes not easily come to us ; we have to work for it . So I try to forget my sons . So I try to think only of Barbara . But Laura and the work I want are waiting to grieve me . I 've grown thin . Loneliness to put myself together and thin . Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Laura : Dinner at HomeFRUIT CUP . MARK AND DAN REPEATING THEIR GOOD-nights . ) " Does it seem as if this campaign has lasted forever ? My head aches all the time , Burr . I think maybe it 's the climate . Do you know that part of Detroit is actually below sea level ? " ( Soup . Burr takes one spoonful , no more . Canned vegetable . ) " The boys hear all about you in day camp . I hear all about you in the papers and on the radio . I hear about myself , too , and think , Who , me ? " ( Steak . Overdone . She knows he likes it bloody rare . ) " Is the steak the way you like it ? " This is a challenge . " Yes , perfect . " ( Salad . He tosses it .

An extra cup follows . She is as bored as he , but can not admit it to herself . Therefore she converts her boredom  --  by the law of conservation of the lack of energy  --  to an unstable discontentment. )  |p335After  dinner , they sat . He tried to talk about the campaign , about Sam Flinn 's new convertible Cadillac with the gadget that sends the top up automatically when it feels a drop of rain , about the way the Party 's leader pronounced the word " elite " ee-light in a speech in Philadelphia . " They 're trying to make him over and teach him to speak Ammurrican . On teevee he looked like he was eating a lemon . " " I wonder why they 're so brittle , " she said . She was frowning at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burr was thinking : All this unhappy woman has to do is to stop being unhappy . A bird flying over Sam Flinn 's Cadillac can make the top grind up . The Party would like to hear its candidate talking like Arthur Godfrey . " Or the Incumbent , " he said aloud . " What , Burr ? There 's already some calcium in my iron pills . " All this unhappy woman has to do .. . Instead she said , " Let 's go to bed . " Before Barbara he had clung to Laura imploringly , begging her to notice his love and feel it . Now he returned to her with the regularity of a lighthouse beacon , to her headaches and her complaints , feeling himself keen after Barbara , cleansed by sea air . Lighthouse-like , impersonal , he could shine upon Laura and not care . She had freckles on her hands , but noticed only the flaws which beauty magazines believed in . She worried about getting fat , was too skinny , had freckles on her hands . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burr . But it 's a crime to think of bed for want of better . They had tried too many times to solve their problems in bed . It had never solved their problems . They would try once again ; tonight it would surely work the miracle . When does solicitude for a wife become a substitute for selfrespect ? But then when does brutality toward a wife stand for despairing desire for her ?  |p336It  was hard to be decent , also hard to be indecent . But a man clasps the girl he loves , that wistful , then urgent spreading to him ... They are in the country ; it is summer . . . . Sun , green , case . . . In the pollen and seed-filled air , chewing blades of grass , recumbent , they speak of the children they will have ... . Burr sneezed . Hay fever , house dust . Laura used sometimes to signal that she really wanted him by leaving out the pins from her hair at nighttime . Now she never did , and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by metal and a quiet spite which pierced his hope of victoryin all things . But he could try anyway ; Barbara rewarded him . Tomorrow Laura would have a headache and he would seek Barbara . The boys would get on her nerves and he would yearn for Barbara . Laura would wonder why nothing seemed right . Barbarawould walk a few moments silently with him , and then they would go to her new apartment . A second cup of coffee and so to bed with Laura . Burr and Laura : TogethernessBURR FORCED A WEDGE INTO THE LONG SUMMER SEASON . They were trying . They were spending the evening together . He put on a Segovia record while Laura showered after they both tucked the boys in to bed . He tapped on the door and told her he was just taking a stroll around the block ; right back . Like all Americans , Burr made much of sex . He made love of sex , either in Puritan denial or Protestant expectation , as if the hard little burning light focused through the magnifying glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that light ; it does burn mightily , and it can distract from the immense timeless daylightgivingpower of the unseen sun . With Barbara he had taken bothp337the pleasure of folding sweetly into a woman , going luxuriously home , and the ferocious hawk joy of swoop , descent , flightwards possession . Comfort and triumph , two moods which give the boundaries of shrill pleasure . Yes , he had needed her much . No , she was not enough . With Laura too sex had been exaggerated , though exaggerated downwards . The play of bed was therapy to earn a night 's rest . A threat of incomplete , unhappy , sleep-destroying failure hung like a third obscene humping partner over their two sweatingbodies . Laura took sex as duty , as right , and did not really want it while she thought she needed it badly . Absently she took him ; ferociously she devoured , grinding her teeth ; like a false incomplete man she struggled in his embrace , and then it was gone , before either of them could feel tenderness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of that . For Laura her happiness was a promise given by America . Her childhood had promised it ; Tier raising as an intelligent and pretty little creature , with everything a man has and a girl besides , had guaranteed it . It was her right ! Like Burr , she had faith in happiness  --  that it was to be given in order to fill the place hollowed out by loneliness . Unlike Laura , however , Burr believed that he must take his happiness , capture it , carry it off . Love for these two had become a consumer product , in which simultaneous delight was part of the purchase , together with the green stamps . Like soap or a ranchstyle house , it was put in the compact and bargain of marriage . The wife thrusts and sweats , athwart her passions like a man . Husband and wife , havingfaith , practice technique together , struggle for good form , anticipate their joys as they anticipate someday , somehow , payingoff the mortgage . The anxious consumers consume themselves . Poor children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is exactly a religion of love , but with only a hell to prove it.  |p338There  were other possibilities . He thought of Barbara 's fine female disdain . " Just please yourself , " she said . " I 'll take care of me . Please yourself and you will please me , mister . " Yes , try . And he looked at the lamps in his neighbors ' picture windows . They wanted picture windows , but they did n't want anyone to look in and had no reason to look out . So they hid the shiny plate of glass with a porcelain lamp which was never it . Poor sad funny neighbors , too . The sensual man sorrows for others , and thus for himself . The truth seeker is without pity . But sometimes Burr was a truth seeker , sometimes sensual ; sometimes merely a truth seeker , sometimesmerely sensual . And always there were descriptions , not definitions : he was merely Burr Fuller in his heart . He fetched air as he strolled , enjoying the walk . Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you love me ? " Somehow it was different from her denial of him at Cedar Point . She sensed danger and strove to rise to the risk she ran . " I love you , Laura . " " Do you love me ! " It was not a question but a cry . " Yes , please darling , yes . " And he meant it , despite Barbara  --  meant that he had wanted to love her so long that this desire was part of his deepest nature , like childish rapid breathing after any strong excitement . " I want everything for you , Laura , " he said . " I 'm unhappy because I do n't understand you . I talk a lot about you , we talk a lot . But I do n't . " To get to the center is a part of the bargain . " Oh , Lord , maybe we do n't have to understand . Maybe we only have to care  --  be sorry for our mistakes , try to do better . Care . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And her look was of desire , but not love  --  the eyes lowered , sideways looking , the two freckledp339hands tensed about each other , entwined , self-devouring . " I want to go all the way into you . " Burr 's mood of hope and submission was passing rapidly toward hope and insubordination . IIe would think of Barbara . No , he would try again and forget the failures of the past . At least she had not yet taken her sedative . So she wants to go all the way into me , he was thinking . He said : " I want only for you to go all the way with me . " She did not hear the difference . He believed that Barbara would not fight him like this . She would be content to be with him , and so eventually she would know him and be known at the center . She could spend herself now without scheming and husbanding her strength . She would not spend the afternoon worrying about the party in the evening and desperately plan a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's energy would rise to need . She had a quick open active face  --  an at-the-center face . She did not sit in a corner to spare the rest of the furniture . She used herself at her best all the time . Laura can not forgive me , he believed , because she can not forgive herself . For what ? She had never believed that anyone loved her , and perhaps never would . She had to do it all herself . But he said it anyway . " Love you . . . " He knelt by her on the couch and put his arms around her to say with dark and unhappy conviction , I love you . It meant : I need you to be happy for my happiness . I want you . I still hope for you as I hope for myself . What he could never , never , never do was to run through the door , throw his briefcase on a chair , clasp his arms about her , crying , " How happy you make me ! How happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because his love for her was a continual tribute which she exacted from him  --  a tribute which he gave out of stubborn will to feel it and make her feel it , out of a stubborn hope that someday she could be made certain andp340generous , out of fear of the unknown harvest of her bitterness . She was drained by her regrets and her unrealizable dreams . She did not have the gift of joy . Years ago lie had begun to dream of healthy , supple , laughing girls  --  absurd boyish dreams , of course . He had hardly determined to look for them , but he had marked them out on the street : This one might be . This one surely is . Here is Barbara . Ile did not know just when he had given up hope for his wife . Perhaps it really was that night at the beach hotel , but there had been hopeful times later . He slept , and again there was hope , renewingitself like blood from the obscure marrow . Perhaps he never did give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms , saying , " Laura , I love you . " He stretched out fully dressed by her side on the couch . A breath of assent , but then the words flowed out , soft , and furry pellets of complaint . " The dampness . . . this climate is n't good for me . . . . The summer is bad enough , but the winter . . . " She meant something else , he knew ; it was his fault , his fault ; but she could not explain it any more than he could remedy it . Remedy ? That legal definition of the duties of a wife : " To provide a remedyfor concupiscence . " As if it were a disease , Laura had said . " I 'm alone all day , " she was saying . His skin itched with cramp and sweat . When he moved she said , " Ouch , you pinched . I know the campaign is important to you , but what about me ? I have to live , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather , wanted to but could not , can not : can not for her and can not for himself . He lay there like dead Tristan . Horror , horror . No , mere perspiration . Gradually he realized that tonight this rocking , complainingbitterness in his arms was the prelude she required . She talked , then wanted a remedy for concupiscence . In fact , she now wanted love . After all the masks love wears , he had never thought it would come dressed in gray wifely conversation : " You leave me alone too much . . . . You think it 's easy to raise two boys whilep341you ring doorbells , flatter politicians , fly to Washington ... . Housework , do you think I was made for it ? " But there is other tender wifely talk ! There must be ! " Do you think I was created and read books and danced with you for that ? Hold me tight , you have to listen , you have to ! " He lay hot and cramped . Then she had talked enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks  --  and raising himself in sudden wakeful fury , he made love on her , not with her , thinking , Barbara , Barbara Barbary , as once he had dreamed of a perfect Laura when he kissed Barbara . Laura opening to him , he thought of fine sleekness , ease , joy ; he thought of Barbara . Laura knew something , she suspected . Terrified , filled with a hatred she did not understand and therefore could not master , her physical reception of him was an aggression which she herselftook for passion . She did not allow him a moment , but as soon as she felt him , flung herself toward him , losing her chance at the slow generosity of love , and it was over in an instant . She allowed herself no contemplation of the wonder of bodies . He pressed her fiercely back , held her , whispered Be still ; but he could no more help her , no more help himself , than he could turn back their ten years together . She thought this was love : briefly he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and died . No , this was not love , it was mortal conflict . It was battle to the death of love , using love as the worst weapon against itself . An efficient assassination . There was draining , exhaustion , partial victory for each , but no shared rest . She won like a man , but wanted to be a woman and hated him because he let her win . When he gripped her like a vise , she hated him because he made her act like a woman and she wanted to fight him . It was mere defeat when he held her down . They tore at each other 's flesh without knowing who they were . She asked herself and asked her analyst , why the insomnia , thep342nagging incompletion , why he slept heavily , turning from her with simulated gratitude , why he turned from her and slept without a word . She could not learn . She could not wait , wait , wait to feel her husband 's weight . Now he awoke after a few minutes of deathly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen to peel an apple , trying to corkscrew off the skin with his knife without breaking it . It twined into the wastebasket while he sat hunched over it , wearing shorts , concentrating on the crisp grainy flesh of the apple under its oily skin . The skin dropped into the basket . He ate rapidly , refreshed by the sweet crisp fruit . The core followed the skin . A few brown seeds lay where they had fallen on the enameled kitchen table . The transition was now nearly complete . This last quarrel of physical love with Laura had gone past stupefying him . He did not sleep like the lost , then wake at dawn : he awakened immediately , ate an apple , and thought with longing and desire of Barbara . Thoughts of Barbara were making the crucial move from dream and adventure into his habitual bed . He did not know whether love should be decisive , whether love is enough ever for anything , for evil or good , but he now believed that he could not deny it , even if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he must stop loving this Laura whose hips clashed like a man 's against his , who bit her lower lip so that it disappeared , whose face strained like an angry boy 's lonely mug . He wanted no suicide pacts for love . And was ready , he thought , for Barbara . The apple was good ; the sleep , the aftersleep would not have been . He would sit with his feet cold on linoleum and think of Barbara and wait for tomorrow . Not merely for spite against his wife , not merely for Barbara 's zest and the freshness of adventure , but for a Barbara who could give him , children and be proud and make love without using it to disguise hatred , without straining to use herself evenp343in this act like a corrupted man . 0 but Laura , he thought  --  he thought in their kitchen , with the taste of apple in his mouth  --  we wanted to love our children ! We wanted to love each other for ever and ever ! THERE ARE TIMES WHEN A MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bay , flat , easy , and warm . There are other times .

Oil . . . Peace . " ) Burr Fuller 's face smiled down from a billboard , gigantic , straddling a roof , and Burr stood below , looking up at it , his heart diminished within him in the autumn chill . Buy me ! The billboard was asking , and he felt sold . Who were Barbara , Laura , and Mike to him now ? What are human beings to the product whose sole function is to sell itself ? Mark ! Dan ! Little faces like mine , he thought with a weak separating lurch in his belly . I feel pain , he noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of me here on the street than up there on the billboard . He had a lunch with Michalski , and afterwards tried to make Laura smile . " Today I was nice to the meanest man in town  --  the Pay Toilet King . He has the concessions for putting on Iocks all over town . " She did not very much smile . He saw Mike and said , " You know Michalski ? He 's the Pay Toilet King , the meanest man in town  --  " " I know , " Mike said . " Laura told me you thought he was funny . " He fled to Barbara for his life . When a woman gets the blues , Lord , she breaks right down and cries , When a man gets the blues , Lord , he grabs that train and rides . . . At Barbara 's apartment he fell asleep and had a dream . Laura was leading him by the hand into their bedroom . She pulled back the sheets , and there was the bed , fouled by insects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead many-legged and **25;532;TOOLONG of all sorts , stuck to the sheets in brown caked shell and liquid . " You did this to my bed , " Laura said without expression , and crawled in and pulled the sheet over her face . He awoke shivering . The sheet had been pulled away and the wool was scratching his flanks . He awakened Barbara , saying , " Talk to me . " Beetles , bugs , flies , guilt ; guilt , guilt , and spiders ; and no responseon her face . Laura would not let him rest , she poked and pried ; but she had never loved him without conditions . So yes he was fouling her bed . Yes he betrayed her . Yes ! yes ! yes ! He said to Barbara : " Ride the great ride with me , honey . " And the breathing-him-in spumy taste of her kiss . BURR WAS HEDGING . Where BARBARA HAD BEEN CERTAIN , he suspended her in his own doubts . Where Laura was uncertain , he moved out and dwelled in his hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his sons , to tell them and to tell himself that he was still with them . Away from home , he worked violently at the campaign , to tell the world that he belonged to it ( the world belonged to him ) . Mike seemed content to wait now . How could two quarreling friends ever make final statements about each other ? Mike would wait , since Burr too wanted to suspend their quarrel . Laura began to get the idea about Burr 's new trick of distancing himself from her . She was n't sure what it meant , but just in case it meant something , she jabbed harder as the election approached . She was not one to wait ; Laura was a hurrier . She would smile coolly at him after one of the rare meetings which she attended . She had a way of pulling up the collar of her blouse which he hadp346once found pleasant and chic ; now it was another of her impatient gestures . " Burr , I do n't know how you can grin at those characters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sociability , Laura . " He was still heated by their applause . " Business , you mean . They wo n't vote for you anyway . Yes , I suppose the ones on the platform will . But the people in the crowd just got tired of watching TV , so they came out to a meeting  --  well , I suppose if it gives you pleasure . " And she shrugged and strolled away to chat with Mike , her toes turned out and heels harsh on the floor of the hall . He watched the two of them talking , talking about his speech no doubt , and thought : If it were n't true about Barbara , I 'd have had to make it true . Barbara was there with her father , who had sat with him on the platform . She stayed by her father 's side . They did not need to talk . She gave strength  --  the strength of revenge against Laura second of all . First of all she gave him the strength of nervous loving patience . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room toward whom he was so alert . ( In the meantime someone jabbered at him ; he jabbered back : " The vote on the oil depletion allowances . . . " ) The hot jostling continued while his cool estimatespleased him and his politician 's talk disguised him . Laura 's eyes were blacked , circled by anxiety ; Barbara 's darkened by intensityand the strain of being a woman . Burr felt his upper teeth against his lower lip in the grin of self-judgment . Trouble , trouble in that way of thinking . Laura had an edged stain of ill feeling at the armholes of her summer dresses . Barbara was hot , and damp as a healthy hot fruit , a squeezed dark plum squirting sweet juice into his mouth when he kissed her . His mouth hurt from the double smile tormenting it : the smile of society for the ADA official with whom he was talking , the smile of self-distrust for these thoughts about Laura and Barbara . Laura walked toward him . It was time to go home . He watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly hadp347to be sucked in all the time . She had been taught so badly . Only in driving sex  --  she knew no other kind  --  could she get her joy of muscling and also let loose her belly like a , a little like a woman . She fought . She fought for him . She did not give and take . She only fought . Homeward . These quiet drives from noisy meetings were the regular portion . They talked little . Sometimes they still made love , desperate and blabbering as if he wanted return to the place from which he had been plucked , and she wanted to force him there and keep him there forever . Force was the trouble ; squalling anger the trouble . This time she just dropped off to sleep . Did her case come of the sleeping pill or a breakthrough with 1 ) r . Berman ? She had somehow been calmed lately , though she was no more gentle . Maybe he was easier on her ; for this she could thank Barbara . Again his grin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat of Detroit was breathless : it either robbed you of alertness or robbed you of sleep . Laura slept , arms flung out over the pillow . He sat straight up and looked at the little plumpness of her belly , white and defenseless , when she slept nude and without covers in the heat . It made him want to love her , shelter her . But if she would awaken , the tendons and strain would be her world again , the struggle would continue . If only she could sleep and wake softly ! He lay back and fell into a deep pit of hot angry anxious sleep . He awoke abruptly in the middle of the night . While still groggy , hardly knowing what he was doing , he touched Laura , saying , " Help me , darling , I 'm lonely . " She looked at him as if he had slapped her , got up , and doors opened . For a moment he thought she was just going to the bathroom , coming back , turning over to resume her sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's sit up and watch . " They went and sat silently near the front window to watch the sky color withp348dawn . They had nothing to say . They held hands . It could be saved yet . If only , if only , Burr thought . Peace . But at breakfast she was merely quiet and distant . Those who make too much of love , Burr decided , get only the body . He wished with all his heart that he could know this and make his knowledge count . BURR WAS AMUSED BY HIS OWN CONTRIBUTION TO THEcampaign newspaper . He used a front-page box to parody Mrs. Grant 's latest utterances , referring constantly to the great speech on fertility . The daily newspapers , of course , had not reported it , but rumor versions did much of Burr 's work for him . Mrs. Grant , unmoved , merely went about contributing more money to churches and charitable clubs : she knew what money would buy because she had bought it in the past . In her case , money had bought office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and Burr admitted that she was no ugly paid reactionary : she was not paid . She was a buyer , not a seller . " She 's sincere , " he said , " and sincerity ' is the most overused word in America . Disc jockeys are sincere . It means they have no cleverness . Pop singers are sincere  --  that means they have no voice . Sincere ' is a publicitygimmick . " He printed his weekly jibe at Mrs. Grant under the headline , " The Hen Robin Says . . . " and drew a cartoon of a chirping , puff-breasted bird to go with it . Mike would have nothing to do with the material , but left space for it in the make-up . Each time that Burr pasted his snarling little joke into place , he felt a twinge of guilt and of triumph  --  guilt for taking advantage of Mike'sp349friendship , triumph for being able to do it . Mike was cold and white , like Laura ; but unlike a wife , he followed his friend in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say nothing at all until he had gathered more to say . He knew something about Barbara and him : he was too good a friend not to recognize the signs . Once lie thought Mike sorrowed with him for Laura 's unrelenting misery , the misery of the cold woman who punishes , punishes , punishes ; now Mike 's pity was all for Laura . Burr had lost his credit . But Mike waited until there was an occasion , another lonely evening , a Tuesday night when he came clown to put the paper to bed . Burr watched him limp about as if the deserts of civilization were too hot for his bare ascetic 's feet . ( His shoes did not fit . Burr wondered if he were too sincere to get proper shoes . ) Burr waited , waited him out , thinking : Mike is thin from eating gnats instead of nightingales , turning all his thoughts into itches . Bachelors have a hard time , wiving , mothering , babying themselvesrapidly into a spurious , pouched , boyish age . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes were heavy with bad sleep , a false fat of water and sinus to replace the easy fat of increasing age . He had a jerking fixed adolescence in his face , but deep etchings of a barren sensual climate extending through his cheeks from the flanges of his nose , and the heavy false solemnityof age in his way of pushing himself out of a chair . Poor Mike ! He made absolute demands ; the gifts of life passed him by . Those dry lines in his cheeks were love burned out by will . And yet he was a good man , determined to be good , as certainlyBurr was not . Burr was hopeful , deliberately blinding himself to the times when hope alone can not do the necessary work . When he struggled with Laura , he struggled ; when he failed , he failed ; and when he left his home in the morning after a term of struggle and failure , he took a deep breath and plunged into his Detroit day . There was the campaign and the little pleasures ofp350food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was Barbara later , there was always hope . Mike was beginning to hate him for this hope as only a friend can learn to hate . He dropped a package of paper clips ; they sang against the floor like the drum in very cool jazz , that paper-clip hiss ; Mike said , " Burr ? Burr ? " He was wearing an old-fashioned green eyeshade to ease his troubled , red-rimmed eyes ; he turned in the creaking swivel chair donated by an office firm , banged his knees against the desk , repeated , " Burr , Burr , we ca n't build a campaign on your hen robin droppings . " " Sorry , friend , it 's not mine . It 's Mrs. Grant 's . I 'm just feeding the robin crumbs to make it grow . " " There are real issues  --  her money , depletion allowances , her tie-ins with the big oil companies . That ought to be scandal enough for you . Why play with this foolishness ? " Burr walked , kicked , because he enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he enjoyed the tingle of his barber 's tan ; he cracked his knuckles and stretched on his toes and felt a high tension of pleasure that he was a machine running smoothly . A politician has to decorate his front just like a shopkeeper  --  thus the tan , the bow tie , the clothes , the smile , the hair brushed with natural bristles ( nylon does n't clean so well , and produces the wrong kind of electricity ) . He said : " Who in this district worries about oil depletion allowances ? A few UAW or schoolteacher subscribers to the New Republic . We do n't win on them , even if we think a long way with them . But people do worry about birth control  --  that 's one thing that 's real to them . We can swing this hen robin thing around by the neck so 's people think she 's advocating the devil 's work in sex . My Polish Catholics , my good Detroit peasants grinding breadcrumbs into their allmeatkolbaca , they care about such things . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What does that have to do with it ? " He gave a ferocious ,  |p351astonished  snort of laughter . " Of course I am . I 'm with Malthus all the way , man . " Ile paused , oppressed by his too-loud voice echoing off the bare walls . Ile lowered the volume for an audience of one . " Look , Mike , you know what I stand for . But until I get in , I stand for nothing , but nothing . We 've been through this already . Unless I 'm in , I 'm nowhere . I mean nowhere . I mean no place at all . " He thought that by repeating and staring and being stupidly obstinate he could make Mike understand . He looked at Mike and stood in the light to force Mike to look at him . But at a distance , a full egg and a sucked eggshell look alike . " Where you are now , " came the particular sarcastic angry voice , and stopped . " Where you are now , " came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unless you stand for what you think you stand for , you do n't stand for it . Does that sound funny to you ? Do n't smile . " " I 'm not smiling , Mike . I 'm listening to you . " He riffled a pile of cards with his picture on them as if they were a gambler 's deck . Jack O'Diamond he was , maybe . He blew through his teeth as if to clean the threads of a frayed hasty meal . " I 've got to get in , Mike . Trust me . Only trust me , will you ? " Mike grimaced , committing the skeletal parody of a smile . " That 's what they mean by the cult of personality . ' Trust you  --  not what you do , but you for being you . I could never do that , Burr . If you remembered me , you would know . " " I should trust you after all these years . But that means you should know me . " " I do , Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices about several matters , I think . I give you credit for being able to make the choice . And blame for the bad ones . " " Well , that 's the way the ball  --  " He held back the cliche : bounces . " That 's the way it is . Sorry . " Mike stood up and moved , slowly and uncertainly , for **30;559;TOOLONG with Neel . Apartment uncluttered , spacious . White rugs on floor . Saarinen chair . A bench from Norway . An excellent reproduction of a Kandinsky abstraction . A water color done by a friend in New Mexico . Greenish bronze artifact found by Neel while in Guatemala  --  a stunning piece , used in death rites , I think he said . Two masks from Orissa . Shelves of books on prison administration , penology , psychology , child guidance , familyguidance , recreation . Books on delinquent this , delinquent that ; on drug addiction ; ballistics ; jujitsu ; architecture , city planning : Neutra , Lewis Mumford , Frank Lloyd Wright , Mies van der Rohe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent report by the Mayor 's Committee on Housing . A report on crime in our city made by the Chief of Police  --  Neel probably wrote it . Lives of famous prison wardens . Practically everything of Dostoevsky 's . Three or four Kafkas . Two shelves of Bertrand Russell , Hegel , Whitehead , Unamuno , Nietzsche , Kant , Goethe . Above his hi-fi was an excellent collection of modern and classical music , and a number of jazz records  --  progressive , Dixie , etc . He had recently said he could get nowhere with the members of one teen-age gang until he began to talk jazz with them  --  " that 's the only way they can dig me . " A few hillbilly records : " they 're my kind , you know . " On a shelf where the magazines and paper books were stacked was something called How to Commit Murder and Leave Full Evidence Behind . Must be a gag : I picked it up , found itp101in typescript , inside hard covers . Began to read : fascinating , crazy stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally , just seems so at first glance ) and called to me to turn on the eight o'clock news , if I wanted to . I preferred to collect the full evidence but I turned on the TV for him and went back to my book . He was coming in and out , now , setting up a small table for breakfast . Laid mats : each a famous murder trial sketched out in the manner of a treasure hunt map  --  I saw this later , at breakfast . At the moment , I was pretty absorbed in the Full Evidebettinnce thesis . He saw me reading it , grinned , finished arranging the silver and plates , and the rest of it . " I 'm shaking the omelet around , " he shouted from the kitchen . " Be with you in half a minute . " He came in , proudly bearing a perfect omelet in an enameled iron pan . He brought in sausage and waffles on a handsome platter  --  fromFinland , I 'd guess . I admired it aloud ; admired the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover : said , " Not bad for a boy who ate with his hands until he was twelve years old , is it ? Three tin spoons and five of us  --  the pup and I managed with our paws . " We laughed . With sudden gravity , " I have the feelingit is bad taste to push my background into the lap of a guest . Perhaps I need to remind myself , now and then , to keep the record straight , but I should n't  --  " He was deftly serving my plate . " I had a rough dream last night  --  it took me back home . I have n't quite returned , to this . " He smiled , quietly became the courteous host he wanted to be , and was . After our first cup of coffee , " About Susan : shall we pitch into her now ? the Chief wants to see us at nine-thirty . " I gave him an account of her visit to my bedroom . Repeated one of her stories in detail so he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him her note . He read it , laid it on the table . Picked it up , read it again . " What else did she say ? " I mentioned her reaction to those four-syllable words . Neel laughed . " She used two of them on the Chief and lostp102him . He said nobody could convince him an eight-year-old would know those words : the kid was too glib to suit him . I suggested her mother probably told her to use the words as a decent way of saying what had to be said . It did n't ring true , he said . " " I agree with you about the words . But I think the Chief is right that the story was made up . The act Susan was describing in those four-syllable words occurred inside her own head , nowhereelse . We 're dealing with a bright , imaginative child who has a gift for telling stories . She 's a lonely child  --  " " They all are , " Neel said . " I know . But Susan 's brand of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about : the imaginary playmate : she 's old for that sort of thing , is n't she ? " He nodded . " All right . This suggests , do n't you think , that while she seems to play well with the neighborhood children , actually she does n't make much contact . " " Could be . " " This contactless association is what I 'm trying to get at . For instance , she and her mother just do n't speak the same language . It may be the mother 's fault ; or the child 's , I do n't know . Whatevercaused it , everything with Susan is now a top-drawer secret . Then suddenly she bursts forth with these wild stories . " " She 's talking in code , do n't you think ? She ca n't say what she feels in plain words so she says it in a kind of explosive fable . " " Something like that . But you 're the psychologist . " We studied each other for a moment . I was not at all sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew about her father . Not too much , I said . At home only on weekends . Was usually at the pier tinkering with his boat . I had never seen Susan with him except at church . He said slowly , " Her mother hates her . I saw it the first time I talked with them . There 's something powerful in Susan which Mrs. Newell ca n't control . She resents it and fears it , yet is trying to exploit it for her own purpose . " " I 'm not sure about that . In fact , I am not sure about myp103analysis of the Newell family . I do n't know enough to say what I 've just said . " Neel looked up , smiled . " Nor do I. " He read the note again , turned it this way , that . Seemed restless . My admission of ignorance did not deter me , however , from further theorizing : " But Susan feels closer to her mother since this occurred , " I said . " She 's never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Because she said she was approached by a man ? " " Because she fell in with her mother 's suggestion that she had been approached by a certain man . " He smiled . " You may be right . " " I may not . But this is what I think : She 's got something now she 's been craving a long time and she 's going to hold on to it . If it means swearing Dr. Channing was in the store , she 'll swear it . " Neel said slowly , " I 'm playing my hunches , I admit  --  but I have a feeling a man was there . " " Why do you think so ? " " I see it written in invisible ink , you might say , on that note . " I suppose my disappointment was splashed all over me , for he smiled and said , " But I do n't think it was Dr. Channing . " He looked at me too long for my comfort . " It could n't have been because you stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It began again : When , exactly , did I see him ? He said , himself , it was n't five-thirty . " Yes , I saw him at five-thirty , " I said firmly . " I 'm not too good about time  --  but this clicked . I happened to break a bottle of hair tonic ; cleaned up the mess , and when I finished I went to the window and saw Mark on his terrace , reading . " " Sure , " he said softly . " It 's down in the written statement wetook from you . That 's why we did n't arrest him in the first place . " " Look , Neel : Susan added the postscript not because it was thetruth she was determined to tell but simply to tease . It 's aweapon she 's found her mother vulnerable to  --  and most grownfolks . You should have heard her tell those stories . When shefinished one she had another ready . Her fantasies are floodingp104her and she has the gift of organizing them into stories , then tells them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give a surprise twist . She 's discovered it works , sometimes . She was scared all right when she ran out of that store but  --  " I hesitated . I-lad the feeling he was more interested in my motivationthan in Susan 's . " Why ? " " I do n't know , of course . But this is what I think : Here 's a half-dark place : nobody in it but her and the cat ; fantasies pouringinto her mind  --  forbidden fantasies , let 's say , about her father ; then the cat scratches her and she feels as if  --  well , almost as if God has punished her for her bad thoughts . Then : what does she do ? She runs out of the store and into the beauty shop and tells them a man has frightened her . She also tells Nella Perkins and the others that she does not know the man . But : when her mother pointed out Mark Channing , she said he was the one . The actual facts are : this little brat has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth pew on the right , the Channings sit in the sixth pew across the aisle . She has big eyes and big ears and she does n't miss a trick . When she is n't sticking out her tongue and walling her eyes at me she 's wriggling and squirming and staring at everybody in the congregation . She would have recognized Dr. Channing instantly , had he been in that store . " " I said I was merely playing my hunch , " Neel spoke quietly . I realized my voice was too urgent . I eased it down . " Mark Channing is my close friend , as you know . I realize I have a predisposition to the theory that Susan made it all up . But I also think there are solid facts to buttress my theory . Will you go along with the kid 's loneliness ? " " Yes . " " And the poor relationship with her parents ? " " It 's worse than poor . " " All right . Her loneliness for a father  --  the tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go along with that ? " " Yes . To a degree . " " OK . The sex part of it : an eight-year-old girl starved forp105healthy affection might settle in her fantasy life for something crude and perverse , do n't you think ? " " Quite likely . " " And these crude , perverse daydreams might very well concernher father since she 's had no real relationship with him ? " " Possibly . Yes , I 'd say it is quite possible that such Oedipal symptoms might show up . " Relief is a mild word for my reaction . I have my doubts concerning the Oedipus complex theory , certainly the strippeddown , literal form in which it is often stated , but now I was clinging to it as if to a life raft . He poured a third cup of coffee for me . Rubbed his thin nose . " Even so , I somehow feel  --  " he stopped . " But go ahead . " " I think  --  this is not a fact but an opinion  --  that to take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , least of all . " " I agree . " " I know  --  this is a fact  --  that Dr. Guthrie could give testimony that would completely exonerate Dr. Channing . But whether he would , I 'm not sure . " " May I ask where you obtained this information ? " " From Dr. Guthrie . He examined Susan on Tuesday evening after that Monday afternoon  --  at the urgent request of her mother who thought Susan had been raped . He found her untouched . He told me that a little girl who has gone through such an experience , whether of rape , attempted rape , or exhibitionism , would instinctively shrink from close contact with any man , at least for a few days . Susie showed no fear ; she was completely poised . " Now my third point : Mrs. Newell seems to have a phobia about rape . She has told me , in confidence , things I can not go into . I can say only that when she was in her early teens , she had a most unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has  --  " He interrupted me . " She 's a bitch from way back . I know her kind , Dave . I should : I have a sister just like her . It has been difficult for me to be objective about this case because I knew what she was , the first five minutes I talked with her . I havep106been afraid I 'd cause a miscarriage of justice because of my personal memories , and my prejudice against this kind of woman . So I 've leaned backward : to be fair to her and her child . " To my astonishment , his quiet manner had disappeared . His voice was low-pitched  --  he 's a mountaineer and like most of them he does not let his feelings show too much  --  but his eyes were bitter , agonized . I was as shaken by his change of mood as if I had stumbled on a human skull while walking on somebody 's front lawn . My first reaction was to defend Renie . I knew I could n't . I realized the center of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be twins . Not just morally or psychologically : they even look alike . Take those British tweeds and Dior gowns off of Mrs. Newell , add ten pounds , put her in a cheap chainstoredress , let her hair get dirty , let her stop brushing her teeth and you have my sister , Hattie Belle . They have the same way with a man  --  inviting him  --  then stripping him clean of whateverit is he values most . They always find it . Money : they take it ; his work : they destroy it ; his secret image of himself : they dirty it up . " I do n't know what Mrs. Newell was like when she was a girl . But I know about Hattie Belle . Since she was ten years old , she 's been layin out of nights "  --  he had slipped as naturally into the old vernacular as if he had pulled on a pair of overalls  --  " with any man she can cheat . She 's married now and has four children but she still cheats : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them are not his . I am not sure any of them are . If I could get up the nerve , I 'd have the Welfare Board take them away from her . But it is more than I could go through . " He sighed . " I do n't know what makes a woman a bitch . I 've read hundreds of books on psychology , delinquency , crime , broken homes , all the rest of it . I 've never found out . The theories wo n't stick to Hattie Belle . She slides right out of them . They wo n't fit Mrs. Newell , either . You can say it is something they feel about their body . It is , but it 's a lot more than that . They use it like a lethal weapon , sure ; and without scruple . They take care , too , because it 's their bank account and insurance policy.  |p107But  there 's something else : they 're addicted to men . And they hate them the same way an alcoholic hates his whisky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this and yet I know it is not right , either . Not quite . When Hattie Belle was no more than two or three she was already at it , standing by the side of the road holding her dress up and no pants on . That kind of thing . Laughing , daring them to look , saying , Give me a penny . But  --  now this is the point : anybody who did n't give her a penny , paid for it ; and anybody who did , paid , too . She 'd run tell pappy on all of them . " He went over to the mantel , picked up one of the Orissa masks , turned it this way ; that way ; set it back in its place . " Children do these things . You know it better than I do , Neel . They have one point of view , we have a different one . " " You think I 'm hard on her . I am , and it 's wrong , and I know it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you want a little something that 's decent to remember about the two or three you used to love . You hate the sheer poverty of your memories . I planned to send her to college , after I got mine ; thought she 'd like to be somebody . She laughed ; said she knew all in the world she needed to know . " He smiled . " Of course she does . And plenty you and I do n't know . " Anyway , she kept it up . Ma would whip her : tell me to run git a switch  --  there was a wild cherry near the creek , and I 'd run and pull off a switch . Felt I was on the side of God when I helped Ma whip her but I 'd end up blubbering with the kid . " He stopped . The Kandinsky abstraction , Saarinen chair , the books , the handsome platter from Finland , the copper jugs and pots .. . fading outHe was saying " . . . taught her to read when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Neel ? " " About eight . You mean when I taught her ? " His eyes were in such pain . I nodded . " Bright  --  was reading fine by the time she was five . But once she learned , what then ? I mean , around her . How did books tie up with what was around her and inside her ? Landrum , can you conceive of the environment I grew up in ? No . You camep108from one of those white-column shacks with blinds on them  --  " he grinned . " More Williamsburg . " I laughed a little . " But small , Neel . We were not rich people . " " Maybe not . But your father was a famous trial lawyer . You had books , knowledge in your background  --  manners  --  idealstraditions  --  well , never mind . I know you can understand , that 's why I 'm telling you . We lived way back in a cove near one of the Balds  --  unpainted cabin  --  no furniture except one double bed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we used for a table . Hattie Belle and I slept on the floor . They 'd take us and put us in the bed to go to sleep , when it was freezingcold , then pick us up , wrap us in a quilt , and lay us on the floor . " He stopped . " Never thought it before but that was a gentle thing , was n't it ? Maybe they did have a little feeling . " Stopped again . Shook his head . " . . . I just do n't know  --  it 'd be easier not to think so . " But sometimes we did n't stay asleep , and we 'd lie there on that freezing-cold hard floor and listen to what was going on in that bed . We thought , or made like we thought , they were fighting . Hattie Belle would say when she was about four or five , They fit all night , did you hear urn ? And she 'd giggle and I 'd feel hot and shamed and would laugh big and whoop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to shut up or I 'd slap her down . I think she slept harder than I did ; a lot of times she 'd be asleep while I lay there thinking about it . . . with no words to help me . Then I got the habit of not thinking . I learned to deliberatelyput my mind on something else : I 'd put my mind on squirrelshooting , force myself to see those squirrels flitting around in the trees , feel myself out in the woods easing up on them , close enough sometimes to see the heart beating in one . " He stopped , looked around the spacious room . I do n't think he saw a thing in it . He was back in those mountains . " There was a big poplar , no nuts on it , mind you , but they loved that tree . " Looked at me . " We do n't know much of anything , do we ? Why did those squirrels like a poplar when there were hickories and oaks around with plenty nuts and acorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , I 'd make myself think about a big rock I knew on the side of old Bald . It had a place under it big enough for two or three mountain cats . There were always tracks there . . . . One night , when I could n't take what I heard going on in that bed , I slipped out and went to the rock and slept under it , sort of hoping a mountain cat would come along and stay with me . I was never scared of wild things  --  it was what lived in houses that got me . " Next day , Pap wore me out . Said a rattler could have bit me walking through those woods barefoot . Ile did n't catch on that the house was full of things that scared me worse than rattlers and copperheads . I just let him beat . Knew better than to try to explain . " Sometimes , on a winter 's day , I 'd sit on an old stump out in the field  --  where you could see the mountains stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows sliding down them , let my eyes move from the far ones to the close ones , peak to peak , along the rough tree-edge  --  wondering what was on the other side , wishing I knew . " He stopped . Said , " This is unpardonable . I intended only to compare her with Hattie Belle . That dream , last night , must have blasted me wide open . Strange . . . how we think we know people when we 've never heard their dreams . Like seeing half a man walking around  --  " " I wish you 'd tell it , if you feel up to it . " He smiled . " I feel up to it  --  in fact , I 'm holding back with the greatest difficulty . But I wo n't inflict it on you . " Back to the other : I got to stealing . Must have been about twelve . Went with a gang of boys who lived round about . Most of them were fifteen and sixteen but they took me along because I was glib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks . " He laughed . " It 's my one talent . I can pick any lock ever made . No use to brag  --  better say , almost any . We 'd go around , nights , opening the houses owned by the summer people . We called them furriners . " Breaking into those places gave me my first view of a room with rugs and furniture in it , and pictures on the wall.  | " First , I 'd pick a lock and open the door , and then I 'd invite the rest of them in as if I owned the place . That was my big moment : I actually felt , because I could get in , I owned the place . That was all I wanted : just to open it , and own it for a minute or so . I guess I stole a little , too ; when the others did . I must have . " Remember in one house there was a chest of drawers and on it a silver tea caddy ( I did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a small carved box . I looked at it and something happenedinside me  --  a wonderful , strange feeling crept through me . Maybe it was joy . I do n't know . I stood there , looking at all of it together  --  I knew whatever gave me the feeling had to do with its being just as it was . I did n't know the word arrangement or pattern , or design but I knew I wanted it to stay just as it was . And then one of the big guys came up and said , You take that tin thing and I 'll take the rest . But I did n't want it , and I did n't want any of it touched . I said , No you ai nt and I ai nt , either ! So he knocked me down and began stomping me and the others had to pull him off . They remembered it was me who could pick the locks . " But after a while , to open houses and steal was n't enough so they started breaking things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a wall ; plates were tricky , they 'd bounce back on you sometimes , but cups were reliable . We 'd take our knives and gash the surface of the tables and chests . We 'd break a mirror  --  and seeing our shattered selves in that shattered glass .... " He looked up . Smiled . " Sort of made modern art out of us . Everythingwe destroyed made us want to destroy more . As I look back now  --  it was as if a door had swung open and let in air and the small smouldering fire down in us had turned into a roaring holocaust . I do n't know . . . I think this now . Anyway , we behavedlike monsters . Some of them would stand on the beds and do their dirty business , right there . Our feelings rose like flames ; then somebody would say , I got ta lay a woman  --  only they said it in worse language than that  --  and they 'd laugh and look at me for I was a runty kid of twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and try to make me do things with him . I 'd fight himp111off . . . it scared me , it made me sick , and yet something in me wanted to do it . " We were bucking poverty and ignorance  --  and monotony . We did n't know the words but we were crazy with the disease . " I did n't speak but I moved my hand  --  in slight disagreement . He said , " I know . That 's looking at it the small way . There 're plenty of decent people in the world who are as poor as I was and as ignorant and who live a monotonous life . But when they 're decent they have something I did n't have  --  and those other kids did n't have . If we could find out what , we might get rid of this delinquency we 're so concerned with . Until we do , we wo n't . " He looked at me earnestly . " You agree to that ? " " Yes , I think I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too sure and got caught and that is how I met the Chief . But I 've told you about the years I lived with him and his wife when he was sheriff of our county . I did n't find out until I was studying sociology at the University that they had kept me because of my poor environment . I thought they had me there because they liked me . " " They did . " He smiled . " Sure , I know . I 'm not mixed up about that . " But I 'm as off the main drag as the old lady in your church who begins everything by telling when she was a blue baby . I wanted to tell you about Hattie Belle because Mrs. Newell is exactly like her  --  and Hattie Belle pulled me right back home . She always tricks , you see ? " He tried to be light about it . " And Mrs. Newell tricks , too . She was determined to ruin Dr. Channing . And her child presented her with the opportunity she needed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " You find it hard to believe , do n't you ? " " It does n't fit what I know of her . " " A literate , charming woman who dresses like a quiet million dollars can be just as bitchy as a dirty ignorant  --  " I could n't let him finish this cruel sentence . I said , " Neel  --  I see it . I know you think Mrs. Newell has a compulsive need to ruin men and that in doing so , she finds satisfaction . But I ca n't for the life of me see why it had to be Mark Channing. "  | " Because he 's repelled her advances at some time or other . It would n't take more than that . " " But we do n't know this . We 're guessing wild . " He glanced at his watch . " Lord ! it 's nine o'clock . You think the main point is that Susan said the man in the store looked like her father ? She said she thought at first it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then she said she forgot  --  he was in Chicago . You think this proves that she was making up a daydream of a tabooed kind . " " I think it is likely . " " You think a trial will do nothing good for Susan but will ruin her social reputation in this city . " " I think they 'll regret it when she grows up , yes . " " And this argument will count with her father . " " Unless he 's lost his senses . And I do n't think he has . " " And you 're sure we are not circumventing justice as far as Dr. Channing is concerned : first , because you think the child made it plain she was fantasying the man ; second , because you saw Channing at five-thirty on his terrace . And , to sum it up : Since he could n't have done it , and we have no evidence concerninganyone else : why not drop the case ? Hmm ? " There was an odd light in his eyes . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claud Newell to do something constructive for the child . " " Such as ? " " Consulting with the Family Guidance Bureau or a psychiatrist . Help the child make some real relationships . " He smiled , looked at his watch . Made no move to go . I said , " Do you have reservations ? Can anything good for the Newells or Channings or this community or the cause of justice come out of such a trial ? " " Not a damned thing . Like to wash up ? " He showed me the bathroom . When I came back , he said , " There 's quite a bit of talk going on . Heard much ? " " No . Mrs. Channing has had anonymous phone calls urgingp113her to leave her husband . Quite a few of them . Also some anonymousletters . Two on pink paper . Rough stuff . " " Through the mail ? " " Slipped under her door . " " Why did n't they tell us ? " " They thought there was nothing you could do about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not much . We must go . Sorry to end our visit so abruptly . I 've enjoyed having you here . And I am embarrassed about dumping my decayed fetid past on you . " " Neel . . . will you let me say something ? " " Sure . " " I 've watched you work with the delinquent kids of this city for three years . You 've done a superb job . I wish you could see Hattie Belle as if she were one of them . " " I wish to God I could . It is my major weakness ; what you might call my cardinal sin : and I am superstitious enough to believe it will throw me , one of these days . " We were in the elevator now . He said , " Objectivity is a difficult thing to achieve  --  desirable as it is . " " Nobody can achieve it and I do n't think it would be desirable to do so even if we could . " " Wait ! Let 's leave that one for next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast ; did n't know you were up to such waffles . He said he hated to admit they came out of a package . And after that , we were silent . Neither of us said much on the way downtown . As he parked the car , he asked me to make the rounds with him some night soon . I said I 'd like to . I asked him about the Vested Interests , a new gang he had run into in the Negro slums ; asked him about the Guided Missiles , the white gang in our section of Windsor Hills . He said , as we went in the building , " Any threats in those letters ? or phone calls ? " " None that I know of . " " Try to find out , will you ? And keep me informed . "  |p114I  promised I would . He stopped at the door of the Chief 's office . Lowered his voice , said , " I do n't believe in God , but lately I 've been wishing I did . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I feel only a terrible need for a world where there is kindness and understanding  --  well , never mind my philosophy . I just wish you could help more with these young hoodlums of ours . They need something I have n't got . " " I have n't got it , either , Neel . " " But you 're still searching  --  and they are . I quit  --  long ago . We 'd better be moving , the Chief gets nervous  --  " We went in . He was waiting for us . I had been warned he had slipped this interview into a crowded schedule . I let Neel do the talking . Somewhere along the way he said , " She 's just like Hattie Belle , Chief ; so you know what we 're up against . " I saw the Chief understood what Neel was talking about . He had picked up a pencil and was drawing wavy lines . Not sayinganything . Face sagging a little  --  he has a moon-face , bright red ; two brown splotches on one cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that falls in strings of skin and muscle in front . Drawing wavy lines . . . not saying a word . Drawing a wavy line , putting dots under it , drawing another , putting dotsHe looked at me . Shrewd , knowing eyes . " What you think , Reverend Landrum ? " " I think the Newell family 's in trouble and it did n't begin in that store . I 'm not too sure there is a beginning to a family 's trou-ble  --  " " I know it ai nt , " he said . " Mrs. Newell is well liked in Windsor Hills . I have found her extremely thoughtful of the sick people and old people in the parish  --  and they love her . I depend on her in our activities and she never lets me down . But you ca n't reason with her about a few things . As for her husband : " " Would n't be in his shoes for a million dollars . " " I know . But it 's his fault , too . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hard at his job  --  " " A man 's got to do something . "  |p115I  decided to let him figure it out at his own speed . He kept drawing those lines . Neel was smoking . I was thinking how to get the child 's point of view over when Neel said , " Chief , you ought to hear those stories Susan told Mr. Landrum . How about telling the one about the prosthesis ? " Neel was smiling a little , not much , as I told it . The Chief listenedsolemnly . When I finished , he said , " You ought 've taken a crutch to her . She 's a menace ! " He looked angry . Began doodling again . I saw he was shaking with laughter . I was so taken aback that I did not laugh with him . As quickly as he could , he said , " I want you to excuse me , Reverend . I know it 's no laughing matter to you . " Gnawing his lip , looking shamed , as a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny as he did , etc . " We 're dealing with an imaginative child , Chief . In my opinion , she made up nine-tenths of what she says happened in the store . She was certainlythere ; she picked up that cat , all right , and he scratched her ; but the rest of it , no . " He was doodling rapidly now . Wavy line , dots . It changed : he was drawing a cat . " You do n't think anyone was there , besides the cat ? " " No . I think she was walking around in the place making up a story . She did something to the cat , perhaps ; I do n't know about that , of course . Anyway he scratched her and jumped out of her arms , she realized how dark the place was , things turned round in her head , and suddenly she felt a character in her own story , so to speak , had hurt her . " The Chief 's eyes gave nothing away . " How about you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; no doubt about that . But I am inclined to think she ca n't tell things straight because she does n't feel or see them straight . Always they are distorted . As I see it : She was in that half-dark place dreaming things , feeling death wishes "  --  the Chief looked at me sharply  --  " toward her mother , maybe ; wishing she had a father to whom she meant a great deal . The cat felt her tension , scratched her , and all of it together scared the daylights out of her . " The Chief looked at me conspiratorially . " He 's a Freudian , you know  --  whatever that is. "  |p116We  laughed . I felt tremendously relieved as Neel moved in to hedge his position . He said , " Chief : there 's something else you should know . " He quickly told him about my talk with Dr. Guthrie . " That 's important evidence . A little girl who has been the object of rape , exhibitionism , anything of the sort , is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Chief nodded . " But , according to the doctor she was at ease . Completely at ease . " " When did the doctor tell you this , Mr. Landrum ? " " Saturday night , after the trouble on Monday . " Still drawing cats . " Claud Newell did not swear out the warrantuntil after the child claimed Dr. Channing had followed her from school . You know this ? " I knew what Mark and Grace had told me . " I 've heard a little about it . What time did she say she was followed ? " " Around four-thirty . " Neel said , " It seems nobody was with Dr. Channing after three o'clock , that day . His secretary went home shortly after lunch because her mother was ill . Dr. Channing says he was in his office studying a batch of slides and had closed the door in order not to be disturbed . He says he left his office at six-thirty and no one happened to be in the automatic elevator when he went down . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child might have had for saying this , if he did n't follow her ? " I could think of a dozen . Susan might have thought it was time to throw more fat on the home fires to keep them burning brightly . I said this . I had an idea  --  but I did n't say it  --  that she was also flexing her new power . A few words : and the entire community falls flat on its face . She 'd try it again , probably  --  and soon . The Chief wanted to know how we figured Dr. Channing had been pulled into it , in the first place . I went at this cautiously . " The two men are curiously alike in appearance , " I said . " Both have brown hair , graying at the tern/pies ; both have thin faces , blue eyes , an easy slow walk . Both are tall and thin . Both drop the left shoulder . " " You 're not saying her father was in there ? " " Certainly not . But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . When she talked to me about it she said she thought , at first , the man was her father  --  but he was in Chicago , she added . She did n't say she remembered he was in Chicago . She said it in a different way : as if , later , she realized he was in Chicago . She has an imaginary playmate ; why not an imaginary father ? " " I 'm as lost as if I was back of Clingman 's Dome , " said the Chief . " You 're telling me this Susan imagined her father was in that dark store making immoral advances to her ? I wo n't buy that one . " " Chief  --  you remember the things you ran into up home when you were sheriff ? " " Yeah , but this ai nt up home . Those poor ignorant folks were shut off , lonely  --  " " You ran into incest cases , did n't you ? pretty often , did n't you , Chief ? " said Neel softly . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was . Now and then . " " All right . But you see , do n't you , how a little girl might imagine that sort of thing and become frightened at her own thoughts ? then , when the cat scratched her , how she might feel as if somebody had scratched her ? She knew better , one piece of her brain knew better ; but it triggered off a lot of fear and other things too ; more fantasies , maybe . " The Chief was drawing cats : big cats , little cats , pussy cats , day-born kittens ; picked up a fresh piece of paper and began on more cats  --  Stopped . Reached in his drawer , felt around for his tobacco , cut off a piece , tucked it in his mouth , said , " And how did the story end ? " We laughed and eased down a bit . I told him what Susan had said about hiding in the rose bushes in the parkway in front of the Channings ' house.  | " That woman told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hid in the rose bushes , she said , was because she thought the child might be wrong . She stressed it that she did n't want to accuse an innocent man . She said Susie recognized him instantly . " " Exactly the way Hattie Belle would have done it , Chief . " " All right , boys , what we going to do ? Hold a private trial and settle it our way ? " Neel carefully made his points : Newell should be told what a trial would do to the child 's future in Windsor Hills , even if they won ; he should also be told he did n't have much of a case and if he lost  --  " " You know better than that , Kel . He 'll win if it goes to court . No jury is going in for all that imagination business . They imagine too much , themselves ; it 'll seem like solid fact . Dr. Channing having had those colored doctors at his place wo n't help him with a jury either . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picked it up , Reverend , here and there . " We waited . He finally said , " I take it , we 're to persuade him to withdraw the charges , mainly for the sake of his child . " " That 's right , " Neel said softly . The Chief was moving around in his chair and belching softly . It was a hint for us to leave . We stood . " Bring Newell in , KelandI 'll see what I can do . But it 's my opinion we 've got a stubbornman on our hands . When you having your little talk , Rever-end ? " " After you , sir  --  if you 'll let me time it that way . " He shifted his tobacco from one cheek to the other . " OK , boys . You know what 's in the books  --  I just know what 's in folks ' nature . We 'll see how it works out . Drop in again , Reverend . I 've got a story I think you might like . It sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear it , sir . " I felt pretty good about the interview . But Neel seemed on the somber side . We did n't say much as he drove back to his place where I had left my car . As I turned toward the Parish House , I saw him heading for the downtown district.  |p119Around  nine , Katie and Sydney dropped in to see Inc . I knew when I saw her face with its carefully cultured indifference that she was disturbed about something . I looked at Sydney . He was going to let her say it , whatever it was . She began by kidding me , " Why do n't you speak to a girl friend when she screams hi at you ? " " Where was the girl friend ? " " On Highway 4o1-A . The rector of All Saints was making a nice leisurely seventy-five . I know because you passed me and I trailed you . What was your hurry ? " " I guess I was thinking about my sermon . I 've had trouble this week finding time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that Charlie had finally got going on the third act of his opera . He had played the first scene , still unfinished , for her that afternoon . She had also read it . " This is Charlie 's music . Nobody else 's . There 's something in it he has never found before  --  a new simplicity  --  But I still think the title may be wrong . The Coward . . . " she said it tentatively and looked at me so long that I smiled and said , Do n't ! " That is exactly what I mean . The audience may say do n't , too . I am not sure people can get emotional distance from it  --  " " I think Katie may be worrying too much . Who minds a man 's cowardice if he is of another nationality ? " Sydney speaking . But it was obvious that they had not come to discuss the third act of Charlie 's opera with me.  |p120Finally  , " Dave . .. " and then she began to say it : Her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , the important ones  --  she said  --  had come in after dinner . " It is none of my business what my father does about his church affairs . I know I am meddling but he should have asked you . Since he did n't , I think you should know . " I suggested that her father as senior warden might feel he had the right , or privilege say , to call an informal meeting of the vestry . " After all , he has been senior warden for nine years . " " Without asking you ? " " Yes , since it was informal . " " Church canon states that the rector is to be present at all vestry meetings . " " You 've been reading up ? " " Yes . " " Your father probably felt he was not stepping across his legal rights . " " Daddy never steps across his legal rights . But as a matter of simple courtesy he should have asked you . " " Not necessarily . " " Dave ... it was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Sydney , got nothing from his face . " What about him ? " " The trial coming up , newspaper publicity , the talk , TV . What this scandal will do to All Saints . In my father 's opinion , any considerate man would have resigned from the vestry the day he was arrested . " It must be extremely embarrassing , her father had said , for the Laboratories . I-Ic was surprised that Dr. Channing had not been asked to leave . It certainly had hurt the Cancer Committee'sdrive for money , there was no doubt about that . But he was thinking now of All Saints : he felt the time had come when the vestry must face up to its obligations and request Dr. Channing'sresignation . I interrupted her , just here , and asked who were there . Ben Jordan of First National Bank , she said ; Lee Esteridge ,  |p121chairman  of the board of Allied Industries ; Dr. Guthrie ; and Simon Reid of Reid , Levin , Weinstein and Winthrop . There followed a discussion , Katie said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reid reminded them that the vestry had no right to ask for a vestryman 's resignation ; it might possibly be requested , it certainly could not be demanded ; a demand could be made only by the parish and only if the rector and parish found just cause . In his opinion , Ben Jordan said , this would he a sensitive matter . Extremely so  --  since Dr. Channing 's guilt had not been established . Coming before the trialLee Esteridge of Allied Industries did not wait for Jordan to finish . He said he was amazed : there was no earthly doubt of the man 's guilt ! He had not heard it questioned before . The Newells were responsible not to say prominent people . Mrs. Newell was highly thought of . How under God 's heaven had Ben arrived at this asinine conclusion ! The damnedest thing " His face and bald head turned purple . I remembered his blood pressure and went over and asked him if he would like some water . He whispered that he never drank it , just pour him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was all he needed . I gave it to him and he sipped it slowly but the purple did n't leave his face so I asked him if he should take one of his tranquilizers and he winked and pulled out the vial and I opened it for him and he took two with his whisky . He said he had to double his dosage when he was around Ben . " All this time , Daddy was concentrating on Ben . " He asked him quietly , smoothly , if he would like to see a vestrymanof All Saints in the headlines . It would inevitably be a sensational and sordid affair . Ben said of course he would n't like it . It was going to be a most unpleasant experience for everyone . Nevertheless , in his opinion , they must keep in mind that Dr. Channing could be , and probably was , as innocent as any man here . This kind of thing had happened before . He remembered reading something in the Saturday Evening Post , once , or the Readers ' Digest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously . Certainly it was embarrassing , extremely so , for All Saints . But who was to blame for that ? Dr. Channing ? the Newells ? or the irresponsible talk sweeping the city ? In his opinion  --  in committee , Ben tends to overwork that phrase  --  Mark Channing should have been given more support at the beginning of the trouble . If the thoughtful people of WindsorHills had spoken up  --  but that was water under the bridge , etc . The point he wanted to make now was this : Dr. Channing was a distinguished scientist ; he had made a notable contribution to the city and to All Saints as a man of intelligence and even wisdom , you might say ; to take him off the vestry now .. . " He really stood up to Daddy . I have never seen anyone do it before . I am afraid  --  " she shrugged . " Of what ? " " I am afraid Ben slipped into momentary amnesia and forgot the facts of life . " " That your father is  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only president . " " What did Dr. Guthrie have to say ? " " Nothing . Perhaps a comment about the weather . I am not sure . He just listened carefully and drank his coffee . " " Who spoke after that ? " " Nobody . " She was rubbing her left hand , exactly as Grace does . " Daddy recapitulated the scandal , the empty store , what the child said , what Mrs. Newell said . Then he reminded them that the Newell child had also accused Mark of following her , after school  --  and that was when the police force finally came to its senses and arrested him . The way he said it : following her after school  --  " She left that . " Every one of them knows Mark well . They know he was at the lab , is always there every afternoon , studying his slides and mice . But when Daddy said it : There was a terrible moment  --  I told Syd about it , it was most strange  --  when I could not see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , a kind of giant abstraction of evil stealthily creeping up behind every little girl in the world . I do n't know what those men saw . With me  --  I suppose it was a kind of throw-back to agep123six . Because Mother , even as sensible as she was about things , would warn me when I was little to be careful and never speak to a strange man , never let myself be left alone with one , with even the men I knew , in lonely places  --  " She looked at us both . " It must do something to little females to be warned from the time they can walk , against men . Of course I see why Mother did it . But  --  this is what I am getting at : Grace and Andy and Mark have always seemed to me  --  not a perfect family but my kind ; how any sane person could fail to feel Mark 's integrity  --  and yet , when Daddy said this , it flashed across my mind , He may have a dual personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you read just enough not to know anything ! I thought this : We think he is somebody who is rational , brilliant , completely decent , our friend , but he may be Somebody Else . " " We are all Somebody Else . I am . You are . Sydney is . Mark is , too . It is only when a man is severely ill that he can lose completecontact with his self-awareness , his memory , values , conscience ; but you know this , Katie . I am no psychiatrist and I have only the muggiest notion of the dynamics of how the wall is built or grows inside a man , cutting him off from the rest of himself . It must begin early and I have the feeling it is n't so much that he never finds his own identity as it is that he never makes a fundamental identification with the one or two human beings he can believe in . I am guessing , I do n't know . " Sydney said , " Drugs can split a man more easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other part goes on a binge . I 've meant to discuss this with you in terms of theology . How can you  --  " " We 'll do it , one of these days . But I 'll tell you now that I do n't have the answers . But Katie is  --  " I turned to her . I said . " The point is , Katie , you know Mark . Hold on to that . " " Yes . But Daddy hypnotized me . His voice was so calm and reasonable and he said it with such moderation and sympathy : as if this were something he had reluctantly brought up only for the sake of God and the church and all the nice little helpless girls in the world . What I am trying to get at is this : He wasp124completely sincere . He believed his own words . He actually felt it was a most painful duty for all of them but they owed it to All Saints , et cetera . He was completely unaware of his real motive . Does this mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your father is sane , Katie , whatever else ! " She looked at us both . " I do n't see the line . If it is here , I do n't see it : between a sick man and an evil one ; or a good man and one who splits his acts off from his real motives . " I thought we 'd better leave that , just now . I said , " What is your father 's real motive ? do you know ? " She looked at me , at Sydney , swallowed hard . Too dry , too terse . Her eyes were bright and cold . Katie learned long ago another way of weeping : her tears rarely show : they slide down into an underground channel . A lake of unshed tears must be insidethat girl . This telling had been difficult . I looked at her : her long , smooth , slender browned hands lay in her lap , limp , nerveless . I said , " Thank you for telling me . It was good of you , Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't offer me a piece of candy , Dave ! " I deserved it , of course . I should have done better than that . The three of us said nothing for a full minute . Sydney was watchfulof her . Now and then , he looked at me . I felt he had encouragedher to come . I knew she now wished she had n't . I saw her face tightening up . She had transgressed her code : which is , of course , to stay out of things and do nothing . She said , " I came because  --  " She could n't finish it . " Because you are concerned . I understand . " I tried to pick up the mood a bit . And yet , all the time I felt I was talking like a professional clergyman . " Remember when you used to tell me you 'd never be guilty of concern about the world 's troubles ? " " It is not the world 's troubles  --  it is Grace and my Andy . Does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know . " Probably not . They think it will level off soon , they 'll tell him something  --  afterward . " " After what ? " she lit a cigarette . Pulled her legs up under her , turned in that slow easy way of hers and looked at me . She is al/most tall , almost Sydney 's height . Her hair is ash blonde and smoothly drawn back . Her skin is not dark , not light : amberish . She has a way of pushing her chin out when she 's thinking . Odd habit but not unattractive . " I saw Grace at the Red Bank theater last night . She is rehearsingthe Anouilh play . She was completely absorbed in it . It was fantastic , her concentration . One of the dancers said to me , She 's wonderful , absolutely  --  but how can she stand up to it , like this ! And I said , She has to . " But it worried me . She seemed too absorbed , as if  --  Why do they think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . " Why , Dave ? Surely they  --  at least , they know he is under arrestand facing a trial . It will ruin them ! " " Let me try it this way : Mark believes  --  no matter what he may think  --  something in him believes this is basically a reasonableworld . He does n't believe a community like Windsor Hills will take a child 's word instead of that of a responsible adult . He probably has never said this to Grace or himself . You do n't . But he is counting on it : on the fact that he is innocent and most people are rational and decent . " " Is he ? Or are they refusing to look at what is ahead ? He could n't possibly believe what you say . All he has to do is listen to TV or read the newspapers . If there is an unreasonable choice open to people , they take it ; a lie they can believe instead of the truth , they believe it " I decided I would n't argue it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agreed with her more than I wanted to admit . Sydney said , " Tell him the rest , honey . " " Daddy has a dossier on them . " My face must have protested the word . " Yes , really . He read from it to the others . " " In your presence ? " " I count about as much as the piano . He expects it to tinkle now and then but he knows it does n't think or see . " Pulling shoulders up a notch . " Walter served another round of drinks and my father told him he would not need him any more . Then he read from it . "  |p126Sydney  gave her a cigarette , looked at me , raised his eyebrows as if to say , Wait until you hear this one ! " The dossier says many things that are true : for instance , that Mark went to Cornell for his medical degree and did his graduate work there in biochemistry . It mentioned his Ph.D . degree . Cited two labs he had trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in World War II and his two years as prisoner in a Japanesecamp  --  I did n't know about that . " She looked at me for confirmation . I nodded . " Sounds accurate , so far . " " Where was he ? " In a camp near Shanghai , I told her . " That is what the dossier stated . This was the first time Daddy editorialized . He looked up and said , Of course Dr. Channing may have lost his loyalty there . As if it were an acknowledged fact that he had lost it ! But Daddy knows it was a Japanese camp , not Communist . He deliberately tried to confuse them  --  " She grinned . " Of course that 's not too difficult . What they tied it up with was the Korean war , the Communist brainwashing of American prisoners ; all of that . But Daddy  --  " Sydney said , " Tell him , Katie , about the other things . " " Yes . " She looked at him a long time , turned to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grinned like a bad kid , but almost at once slipped on her tight expressionless mask . " He has found out things about Grace . She studied ballet in New York one year , and then modern dance with Martha Grahamand Hanya Holm . Three years in all , the dossier says . We know that is true . But in her dance group , at one time or another , there were some Negroes . Daddy mentioned two men . He has pictures and passed them around . " She almost smiled . " The silencecreaked . One would look and pass the picture on to the next one , and he would look  --  You 'd have thought they were little boys peeking at their first French post cards . " But this is the point : Daddy did it deliberately . He knew what it would do to their fears or guilt or memories or whatever it is this sort of thi ing works on . " She swallowed hard . " He did that ! My father . If he had been a sleazy demagogue running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could  --  " Stopped . " You do n't know where he found the pictures , do you ? " I kept my voice as easy and casual as possible . " No . I have pictures of Grace , of course . Dancing alone  --  a few with her groups up in New York  --  some of our group here at Red Bank and with the kids at camp . I was there after Grace was counselor but Jane gave them to me . He may have seen them and it may have given him the idea , but I have none of her with the Negro dancers . What I think , Dave : he hired an investigator , detective , whoever does this sort of thing for pay . Does that sound probable ? " " Yes . " " Could this spy have slipped into their home and found the pictures ? " " It is possible . " Sydney said , " Do you mind , Katie , if I mention the point  --  I believe you said it was the one he stressed  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When was this ? " Katie said it was in 1941 or ' 42 , she was not sure . She asked , " Is that true ? " " I do n't know . She has never mentioned it to me . " " He skimmed the dossier ; slowed down only to make his points . One thing he stressed was the fact that Grace went , several times , with her roommate to a meeting of a front organization . Oh yes , he told them that she was , right now , a member of the American Civil Liberties Union . This is when I goofed . " " How ? " " I laughed . I said , You 'll have to find something else , Daddy , I 'm afraid . The ACLU is strongly opposed to communism . What it tries to do is protect all people 's civil liberties . " Same thing , Esteridge muttered . Then her father said something light and casual about his little girl having picked up a few naive ideas while she was at Vassar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " They gave him a big hand . I mean they laughed . "  | " ' Then yon  --  " " Played dead again . I had tinkled , they were annoyed . Except Ben : he winked at me . Slyly  --  but he winked . " " They were rude , of course . " " they are evil . But you are thinking that , in spite of it , they do many good things , are n't you ? " " Katie . . . they are trying to hold on to a world that no longer exists . They are blind and terrified because they feel it slipping away from them . They are gripping thin air but they keep trying desperately to hold on to it  --  hoping the air will turn into something familiar and solid . I just do n't think we get anywhereby condemning them " " They are evil . I know you think it is your duty to try to believe in the human race . You think if you trust it , it will finally come through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ratty . I understandperfectly that they had to choose : diminish me or diminish Daddy . The choice was easy to make . But all that is n't impor-tant . " She fumbled around for her cigarettes , remembered she was smoking one , picked it up . It had gone out . We both tried to light it for her . " But he is right . I am naive . I keep thinking it is only illiterate people who talk the way he did  --  and politicians , like McCarthy was and his cronies still are and the breed we grow down here . I know it but I ca n't believe it . He went to Chapel Hill ; to Oxford for three years ; stays at the Waldorf in New York ; is a patron of the Philharmonic ; goes to London , Paris , Frankfurt two or three times a year  --  how on earth  --  " We were smiling . She stared at us , then laughed . " You see ! I am silly . But you know what I mean : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " She stopped . Began again , " I ca n't see it , Dave ; so I 'm afraid what I 've said may be untrue . I have told it as I see it but is it that I am not seeing it right ? I 've never tried to understand my father : the idea has seemed too terrifying . All I can put together about this is : Mark is searching for the cause of cancer ; Mother died of cancer ; myp129father is chairman of the Cancer Committee . If this is true , how can he be against Mark ? " " I do n't think he is . " " You mean personally . " " I mean in every way . Mark is a scientist . Your father is not opposed to science , he respects it . Mark is not political-minded ; not enough , he always says . Nor does he go around smashing other people 's economic idols . On those levels he is certainly no obvious threat to your father or your father 's world . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why is he witch hunting ? " I had no answer to that . Sydney stood up . " We must go , honey " She said , " I 'd leave tomorrow and camp out on the nice old Left Bank the rest of my life and forget everything , but Sydney wo n't go with me . And whither he stays , I stay . Is he worth it , Dave ? " We laughed . They told me good night and left . I was still there  --  standing , thinking or beginning to think about what she had told me ; knowing it was a shade distorted , too full of the feeling she had hidden so many years  --  when the door opened . She came in . She said softly , " I am going to Sydney 's apartment for the night . " I waited.  | " Shocked you ? " " Not beyond the point of recovery . You may have shocked a little tyke who rents the nursery from you . " We liked each other . I felt I could say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no talent for it . Just a good guesser . " That neutral face . But this time the eyes were soft . I said , " Katie . . . are you going because you love Sydney or to punish your father ? " " Both . I 'm frugal . Always looking for bargains . " " When are you going to marry him ? You want to , do n't you ? " " Very much , Dave . And I 'd like to measure up to that marriage . " Her voice was honest and gentle . " I know you would . And he would , too . Why put it off ? " " Money . " " You do n't think he is doing well enough ? or he does n't ? " " I think he is doing marvelously . It is the money Mother left me . Dad 's too  --  although he is not leaving me much . He is settingup a foundation  --  a kind of shrine to Capitalism  --  to keep the government from spending the inheritance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hates . Syd has worked very hard . His people had enough  --  that is , his father was a small-town Ford dealer and did all right  --  but Syd had to borrow , finally , to get through those ten years of medical training . " " I thought he told me he had repaid it . " " He has . " " Then why not  --  " " He says if he marries a rich girl there is nothing , really , he can give her . To me , that is materialism in a big way . " I waited . " I try to tell him what he means to me . The fact that we can actually talk and understand what the other is saying , at least two-thirds of the time  --  " " That 's a high rating . " " I know . " She smiled . She was still standing . She picked up a round glass paperweight , held it , rubbed it . " I suppose it sounds like the first act of the same old play : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because I 've always had it ; oxygen means nothing , either , until you 're cut off from it . All the old lines . Then I try to tell him about Mother : how she felt about money , that it was hers only to be used for others in the world . He does n't believe she was like that . He says , Why did she leave you half a million if she felt it belonged to the world ? I do n't know why . At the last , when she knew she was dying , she weakened : I suppose she was afraid something might happen  --  a depression might come  --  anyway , she left me a third of what she had . And now Syd feels he has to match it . Could you help him see ? " That was the most she had ever said to me . I told her Syd and I would have a talk . Then she said , as if feeling her way , " Dave ... my father is fond of you . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wish you had the originals . You like Marin very much , do n't you ? " " Yes . But I ca n't afford real Marins . Anyway , I like these , I 've hung around them a long time . " She smiled . " Would you let me give you two ? " " No . " " One ? " " No . " " As a special favor to me , would you ? I happen to know where there are  --  " I was shaking my head . She did n't complete the sentence . I could n't see quite how this had come up . Now I realize she was trying to block her father 's little tipping scheme  --  but I could n't see , then , and I felt annoyed with her . I said , " You must not buy Syd any paintings , either . Let him buy them for you . " " You both value things too much . " " I value my relationships . Things can twist them into peculiar shapes , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read those thoughts . She said , " You give me a bleak view of myself . And I suppose you are right . When I care for people I go out and buy them a present  --  I do n't seem to know anything else to do . " Then she said , " Forgetp132it . I came back to tell you this : Daddy is very fond of you . " I did n't like the sound of it . " I think because he is , you  --  " " Might influence him ? If you 're suggesting that , I think you are wrong . " " I 'm not . He wants to influence you . When he likes anyone he must dominate him . " There was n't much to say to that . " What he is after is to destroy your friendship with Mark . He wants him out of your life . " Nothing to say to that , either . " Because he thinks Mark dominates you . " " Wait a minute ! I 'm not aware that anyone dominates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all can be dominated : by the bishop , the senior warden , the parishioners , their own ambition or greed , or a friend who has brains  --  " There was a snake-coldness in the girl 's face . I was infuriated . Whether with her or her father or both or only with myself , I am not sure , even today . " He has contempt , only contempt , for those he can dominate and hatred for those he fails on . You ca n't win . " No answer from me . I felt she might be warning me in this nasty oblique way ; or was she only trying to hurt something , anything " I 've carried on a cold war with him since I was eight years old . " This gave me a chance to pull away from her father and me . " Why eight ? Something interesting happen when you were eight ? " She smiled . " I begin at eight because that is as far back as I can remember . " " Nothing ? Clean sheet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably such a mess my memory locked it up . But from eight , it seems to be fairly respectable . Full of Mother and Alice , my governess . Alice B. Toklas . " She smiled . " One of Mother 's sad little jokes . At least , she made it once or twice and I 've held on to it . " Syd was in the car , waiting , but things were on her mind . Ip133offered her a chair . She did n't seem to hear me but she sat down . She said , " Do n't worry about Syd . He likes nothing better than to sit in the dark in a car by himself . He really likes to . " She was looking at my father 's old desk . Not quite as if she saw it ; looking through it . " My governess was named Alice Brown . Mother added the other for fun . Mother met Gertrude Stein in Paris , years ago . She had admired her writing and her theories and she was enormously impressed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really liked . Mother thought my governess was a wise and sensitive as well as learned woman and since she happened to look amazingly like Miss Toklas , Mother called her that . A time or two . Not much of a joke . I am not sure Mother had a real sense of humor . Mother . . . was alwayssearching  --  not so much for the avant-garde as for the handful of people in our time who might , just might , be changingthe human race by a poem , a novel , a painting , an idea , a belief , or simply by being a more complex and aware and loving , brave person than the rest of us . The germinal ones , she called them . Mother thought the human race could change , was alwayschanging . Of course I do n't . Of all of them , the one she wanted most to meet was Gandhi . She called him Gandhiji , just as his followers did . " Her tongue was rattling . The closed-up , masked Katie was talking as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to India . She had written Gandhiji many times and now and then he wrote her a brief note , or his secretary did . And finally , it was arranged for her to have a talk with him . He was assassinatedtwo weeks before she was to fly over . She postponed her trip . A month later , they found she had leukemia . " They did n't tell me . I knew she was dying but they pretended I did n't know and I pretended and the big mysterious moment came nearer and nearer and it had no name and all the time her eyes were saying , Do n't look . . . pretend with me it is not here , let 's pretend a day or two longer . " My irritation was gone . " How old were you , Katie ? " " Twelve . An old twelve , they say . " She smiled . And once more the blankness slid over her face.  |p134I  waited . She said , " Dave . . . something is happening , and we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way when Mother was dying . I dreamed of her last night and the night before and the night before : We were somewhere and at the same time nowherenobody no background no scenery or climate nothing but us , but I definitely felt we were somewhere we had been before and she was talking to me as she had done those weeks  --  she alwaystalked to me but even more those last weeks  --  about love and pity and compassion , and opening up so that you can understand  --  sheused that phrase . She 'd say , If you are tight and small you can never understand , you have to let yourself open up and that means seeing and feeling things you 've never seen or felt before in others and yourself , things you do n't like but only in this way can you become a person and a free one : you 'll understand what hate is only when you feel your own hate destroying you , and you 'll never know love until you love so passionately you are willing to risk everything  --  " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying , " And now in my dream , Mother was talking , like that . But when I waked up I could not remember a word she said . But I felt it was very important for me to remember . But not a word came back . It was as if she were still near me and trying to make me hear . I know that can not be . I know she is not near me . I know what death is  --  " " Do you , Katie ? " " Annihilation . When it comes , that is the end . " She looked at me , expecting me , I think , to argue with her . I had better sense , this time . I was beginning to understand that Katie climbs toward the truth by jumping from one lie to another . Says it , says what she does not believe so that she will finally have the courage to say , Maybe I do n't really know , after all . She was saying , " But I felt she was near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yesterday almost constantly about what she said to me , those last months she lived . I suppose she was trying to say enough to last me a lifetime . I understood so little of it , then . She read me the poets she loved , Valery and Rilke and St. John Perse  --  and Jeffers . Of course he is not fashionable ,  |p135now  . " She stopped . " That would have hurt her . She read and she talked about the philosophers she loved and she talked about the contemporary music she loved , Stravinsky , and the young modemsshe wanted me to be sure to listen to  --  and she told me about places in the world she loved , and sunsets she had seen , and moonlight , and she even wrote out her favorite recipes  --  and all the time I was thinking of what was happening to us , what was coming closer and closer , I did n't care in the least about anything she was saying , I was watching the other " But I should n't talk about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad you do . " " Dave , " she had left that , " in the dream , I felt she was warningme : to be careful , to watch out  --  not for me , it was someone else I must watch out for . Someone whose face I could not see . Strange . . . and then , when I waked up I was thinking of Charlie . I lay there wondering why . I did n't know why . I was just thinking about him  --  I could see those wonderful hands of his , could hear him playing , and then I was remembering his breakdown a few years ago , and his terrible terrible agony and fear of people , his inability to trust himself to do anything but play his music , and write it . He would n't drive a car for so long ; he would n't go out to see people , and his stammering which is not bad at all , only when he loses his confidence , was so awful . And then , I suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my good and beloved friend . I want him to be yours , too . He has a fine talent . Whether he will develop it , I do n't know ; his life has been hard ; you may hear things when you grow up but if you do , I want you to know they are not true . And then she told me I must do all I could to see to it that he never stopped composing . That I must help him if he ever needed it . " She turned to me . " Dave . . . what did she think I might hear ? I have n't ever heard anything . Have you ? " I shook my head . " He could n't possibly be involved in  --  all this , could he ? " " Not possibly . Not remotely involved . " " Strange . . . how I felt it had something to do with him , what I dreamed . Of course , I do n't believe in that sort of thing.  |p136But  it pulls you . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , once , that she thought I was like him in many ways  --  and I had n't liked her saying it a bit . She smiled and said it again : You are like him in many ways and because you are , the two of you may not get along too well , when you grow up . He can be difficult . But you can be , too . I want you to remember there is something very good and generous in your father . You find it . That is your job . " She was looking down at the floor , those slender brown hands limp and passive . She looked up , " I have never found it , Dave . If she had lived she would have kept him from doing this to Mark . I ca n't . " " Because you do n't love him ? " " I do n't know . " Stopped . Stared at the desk . " She wrote me letters , one for every birthday until I was twenty-one . She wanted them to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter would be there : knowing I had to read it : knowing it would turn my birthday back into the day of her death . She wanted so much to live those years with me but all it did was  --  " Constance . She 'd managed it , though , somehow ; for she was here with us , in my study , and she was pushing and nudging her daughter  --  whether in the right direction , I did n't know . The firm hands that reach out from the grave blindly pulling and pushing . .. . I said , " You came because you think I can do something to help , did n't you ? " " Yes . My father has called a meeting , informally I 'm sure , of the full vestry for late Sunday afternoon . At our house . I hope you will be there . " " Barge in ? " " I do n't care how ; just come . You ca n't swing Daddy  --  and do n't try  --  but you can persuade the others not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her I would be there . I 'd try to have a talk with her father before the meeting , if I could ; perhaps Saturday morning  --  he had asked me out to the farm , perhaps we could have a littletalk while there . She said , " I must run along . There is a patient at the hospital Syd wants to look in on . I do n't see why being a vestryman is important to Mark . It may not be . But it will hurt him to be pushed out this way . " " It will hurt the church more . " " I care only for what it will do to him and Grace . Night , dear . " She slipped out the door . Splintery . That is the word that came to my mind . The pieces of Katie . . . . Maybe her love for Sydney would finish the fusing , someday . A year or two ago , I had tried to talk to her as her priest : I got nowhere . She pushed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind rejected the basic assumptions of the Church : she could not believe that Jesus Christ was actually God 's Son , she could not think of the Cross as I spoke to her of it , or the Atonement , she could not believe in God , she did not see sacrifice as essential to the human person , she did not believe there is cosmic purpose in our being on this earth , it was sheer accident . And yet , the Sunday after storming out at me , she partookof Communion with the deepest gravity , as she had always done . Believing and not believing , accepting and rejecting ; unable to find what could speak to her modern mind and just as unable to give up the ancient symbols that whisper persistently to the measureless , yearning unhistoric part of all of us . I tried to stop thinking about her . It was more urgent now to think about her father and that dossier . Why did he care so much about Mark that he was willing to spend money and time to destroy him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fond of you . The next thing , she 'd be naming it , so that I 'd make no mistakeas to what kind of feeling the " fondness " consisted of . I laughed . Katie 's sophistication can get you down , sometimes . She is , too often , that " old twelve " she smiles at.  |p138But  I could n't laugh off the microbes Snyder had let loose by reading that incredible dossier . All I could do , right now , was hope those responsible vestrymen would be responsible enough to keep their mouths shut . Once Newell withdraws those charges  --  once that is done , things will clear up and the talk will stop . I did n't actually believe that . As usual , I was fighting my fears with an overdose of optimism . Neel . Now and then , throughout the day , I had thought about him . Strange . . . you start on one thing , then you 're on another . Hattie Belle : he could n't get her off his mind or out of his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you could . But he does n't hate her , no ; he is just ashamed that something in him still clings to something in her . When I left him this morning , I had felt our plan would work , Claud Newell would almost certainly be amenable to our arguments . I had thought , I 'll call Mark during the day and tell him what we are up to . But I did n't . I could n't forget Neel 's face long enough . Perhaps he had said too much about Hattie Belle  --  this sort of thing leaves you washed out , afterward . I was n't sure . I had the feeling Neel believed the situation had slipped beyond our grasp . I decided not to call Mark . Maybe tomorrow . This dossier . . . . I went upstairs and to bed . Katie 's dreams  --  back with me again . She had kept thinking about Charlie . So she had never heard anything . Good . Not even about his attempted suicide . That was good , too . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Charlie and when you 're talking to a man who has tried to kill himself twenty minutes before , you 're not likely to get it too straight . I had stayed with him all night , for he was pretty confused for a while , memories sloshing over him as if he were drowning in them . But gradually he quieted down . Left his early memories and came closer , I think , to the big thing that bothered him most . I may be wrong here : there may have been a dozen big things I do n't know which the psychiatristmay know and certainly if he does , can evaluate more expertly than I. But what Charlie finally told me was this : There had been an accident : a cliff somewhere not too farp139from High Falls : a child had fallen and been killed . Charlie was sixteen , seventeen , maybe . The oldest in the group . In a sense , he was in charge . The boys were staying with their families at one of the summer hotels and he had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great mountain of a cliff one of them had gone too near the edge . Charlie blamed himself for this , for everything . Said he should have been more explicit in his warnings , should have set up some rules for them . Anyway , the youngsterfell and by miraculous chance caught on a narrow ledge twenty feet below , rolled half over and stopped himself when part of his body was on the edge of it by grasping a small azalea bush growing in a crevice of the ledge . Below that azalea lay a sheer two-hundred-foot drop . Charlie called to him to hold on , he was coming , just hold on to that bush . Then he sent the rest of them back to the village and farmhouses for help . He shouted to the boy to pull himself back a little . The boy said he could n't . Charlie saw the crumpled leg , broken , he decided , so he told him to hang on , he was coming . Then he looked at that narrow ledge twenty feet down ; looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moss-covered rounded boulders ; finally saw between two of them not a path but a thin split , wide enough for his body if he handled himself sidewise , that seemed to extend down to the ledge . He could n't see down , the split had a sharp twist in it , he assumed it went to the ledge . He slid in , easing his body this way , that , through the fissure , bracing himself against first one boulder then the other , feeling for something solid to get a toe hold on , shifting , easing , bracing . Then abruptly , the split widened and there was nothing under his feet . Directly below him , about eight feet below , was the ledge . He could n't hang on to the boulders , bracing his body against one then the other as he had been doing , for they were too wide apart ; he could n't choose one and cling to it for there was no toe hold or handhold on either of those rounded slick rocks . He could n't slide down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , he would n't be able to control the speed of the slide . He had no choice but to drop to that ledge below , or go back . He looked down , he saw the boy , yes ; he said he 'd always see him , but he saw that two/hundred-foot precipice too , and he panicked . All he had to do was let go and drop eight feet to that ledge , relax , and drop easy and be sure he used his ankles to pull his weight around , just a little . You might as well tell somebody all he has to do to handle ' a jet plane is this and this and this . If you 've disciplined your body all your life , bone against muscle and tendon against bone , made it do your way in water and air and on slippery terrain , if you 've taught it about weight and checks and counterchecks , all right . But Charlie had n't . His hands could do miracles with a keyboard , but he just did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ledge was only about two feet wide but that was no excuse . I could n't do it and I knew it . I just could n't do it . And then , for a while , I could n't follow his words because of his sobs and his stammering . Well , anyway : there he was . And all the time , the kid 's body was hanging half over the ledge just below him , out of balance , too much of him hanging in space , and he was hurt and could n't pull himself back , too much weight was on that hand clutching the azalea , and finally the kid called softly , almost like a sigh , I 'm gone . . . and the body slowly rolled over the edge and disappeared while Charlie watched it . When help came , he told the truth about what had happened . A local boy said before he had finished , Get out of my way ! and Charlie pulled up again just as he had pulled down . Then the local boy slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got quickly to the spot where the split widened , looked down and then dropped as easy as a cat to the ledge ; lay down on his belly and grasping that azalea hung over , far out , trying to spot the body two hundred feet below . He could n't see it . When he came back nobody said anything : all of them just looked at Charlie . They had been born in those mountains , their eyes and muscles and inner ear were as used to the sheer drops , the precipitous slick moss-covered sharp jutting cliffs as city kids are used to traffic-jammed streets . They did n't say a word , they just looked it . When Charlie got back to the hotel nobody said a word of criticism , he told me , they just looked it . In the village , people would say when they saw him , Yeah , he 's the one , and then they looked it . This is what he thought they said : He 's the one.  |p141There  were many Windsor Hills people on vacation up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . All this , Charlie told me in choked stammering words that night four years ago when he tried finally to use the .38 and stop those looks . " And then , when I loaded it , I could n't even pull the trigger . I am afraid to live and afraid to die . " I emptied the gun and slipped it in my pocket . The accident had happened years ago . Gradually , slowly , not all at once , Charlie 's whole life had got caught in that thin crevasse between slick rounded bouldersand everything finally , except his music , came to the place where he had to let go and drop  --  and Charlie could n't do it . He was much better , now . But it had shaped him  --  not only his feelings and mind and acts but his body : he walked cautiously , he almost minced , and I 've seen men raise their eyebrows and smile a sliding sort of smile as he passed and I knew what they were thinking . Oh sure . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested the boy choir to him . I thought a good choir would be fine for All Saints , and Charlie  --  and the whole city . Of course he was afraid of it . He said , " Y-y-y-y-you 'd t-t-trust me . . . with them ? " " Anywhere , under any condition . Grace and Mark want you to try Andy out if you decide to do it . " He looked at me a full ten minutes . Then he smiled that gentle sad smile which he turns on people and dogs and the ideas he likes . He did n't say a word . A year passed before he finally felt up to it . All had gone well . A few months later , at Neel 's suggestion , we had added ten youngsters from the Flats who had unusual voices and nothing else much . About the time he took on the choir he started his opera , The Coward . I wished Constance had stayed out of it . What Katie had told me and all I remembered left me restless and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing it would either get my mind off of this or put me to sleep in about five minutes . The latter , probably , for I must say Heidegger can write the most involved opaque sentences I have ever plowed through.  |p142Sometime  in the night , I found myself awake . Thinking not about Mark and Grace or Charlie or Dewey Snyder or Susan Newell or any of the rest of it , but about my sister Meg : I was fourteen and she was sixteen . We were on the tennis court . Mother , as usual , was coaching us . We had gone out to play , just to play and have fun ; but Mother came out , too , and turned it into a hard hour of coaching : Watch that drive , Dave , your balance is not good ; Meg , lift it from the shoulder , no , lower down , lift now with your hip muscles  --  sure you can , Margaret , watch Dave  --  Dave , show her your footwork  --  show her how you smash it  --  lob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through easy easy  --  Margaret , show him your wrist work , show him  --  Margaret , put it on the line six inches from the alley  --  and Margaret'ssudden I do n't want to , Ma ! we 're just playing , we want to play a littleAnd then Dad drove up , got out of the car , walked past the tennis court , with his brief case , glanced at me , at Meg , quizzically ; we both saw the look ; and then Mother followed him inside . And suddenly the court was a battleground : we began driving those balls at each other , at each other 's body ; I aimed for her breasts and she aimed for my genitals and we both aimed to hurt , kill , maybe  --  if we could ; and the fury rose in us , and a terrible resentment , and we made each other the object of it , there was nothing but hate in her eyes and nothing but hate in my mind , and my muscles and footwork were perfect and so were hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , she lobbed a deceptively soft one and almost got me , and I aimed two at the backline and she relaxed , then suddenly I drove one straight at her left breast , she ducked , it hit her shoulder and hurt , I saw the agony and I was glad glad ! And then Mother was there again calling out to me , Stop it , Dave ! And I stopped , breathing hard , thinking she would scold us both , thinking she might say a great deal . But all she said was , Your footwork is abominable . And Meg laughed and I laughed and we kept on laughing , almost yelling , and suddenly we were friends and it was Mother who was the enemy  --   |p143Meg  . . . what a sister to have ! always competing with you and winning more than her share . She is still a superb tennis player . Cool , quick , sure ; placing those balls within half an inch of where she intends them to go . Thinking of life as if it were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so simple to Meg ; she alwaysknows why she 's a Democrat and is curt and impatient when I say , sometimes , I wonder why I am ; liberal , yes ; but when she tells you why she is , you almost decide to try to understand the conservative point of view better ; just as sure of her theology , impatient with my doubts , my fumbling , my questioning . " If you 're not sure , get out of the Church , Dave . You 'd be good at half a dozen other things . " Then she begins to tell me what I 'd be good at  --  as if she were a vocational guidance counselor . And suddenly , we are at each other 's throats again and she finally ends it by saying , Oh , these men , these men ; the women are the realists of the world , they are the ones who know the grubby facts . So it goes : I am as opposed to segregation as Meg is and I think I have better and deeper reasons than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started on segregation and integration , I find myself answering her as if I were a cautious , vague Moderate . She can twist you and turn you until you are defending all you are opposed to , and although I think I know her well , I do n't know why she can do this to me . She married a few years ago and has three children . Her husband is a man about Dad 's size , and Dad was small ; a quiet fellow , who makes a lot of money but does n't say much ; does n't , as far as I know , think much except about financial affairs and sports . But when Meg gets going , when she says , Now is n't that just like a man ! Ed chuckles , looks at her , looks at me , and chuckles . It makes you wonder about them  --  you feel Meg has met her match in Ed but you wonder how , and you begin to think about things that are no business of yours to be thinking about if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get some sleep . Yeah . . . sure . . . Meg would know exactly what to do about all this . . . . She 'd have the answer . . . she 'd place it . . . right on the line . . . but where ? what line ?  |p144On  Friday evening I thought again , Why not tell them about my talk with Neel and the Chief . It is not settled but  --  go ahead and tell them . I had seen Grace at the shopping center late in the afternoon , coming out of Walgreen 's . I was in my car . I called out to her but she was too preoccupied to hear . She looked wan and unrelated  --  as if she had been torn out of a book and picked up by a wind  --  It bothered me . I wished I had not thought it . As I drove on past Town and Country Clothes , past Nella 's Beauty Shop , past Toni 's old store , I could not shake off the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : she puts up such a good front when she is with you . Front is the wrong word . Grace hides herself , yes ; but not behind a facade . She hides herself behind you . It is difficult to define what I mean . I am not sure I can . She seems to possess to an extraordinary degree sensitive antennae which instantly pick up whatever message your personality is sending out and she responds by adjusting with fabulous ease to your mood , your rhythm , your interests . There is nothing passive or neutral about her : you feel her , all right . But you do n't go to her  --  if you did you might not reach your destination . She comes to you . And the closer she comes to you the farther away the real Grace seems to be . She slips through words because the part of her that is , she keeps aloof ; the part of her that becomes you is all you are aware of ; so you fall into the habit of taking for grantedp145that what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection of yourself ( or of Mark for they were together so much of the time )  --  is all there is of her . The realization came to me as a genuine shock that she might be having a difficult time of it on her own personal terms ; that she might possibly be experiencing something which Mark knew nothing about and had not given a thought to . As I drove away from the shopping center and down Arlington , toward the lake  --  I was taking a Graham Greene suspense novel to a retired school teacher who is kept in by an invalid brother  --  I tried to pick up a few pieces of the real Grace , attempting to see her as if the rest of us did not exist . An impossible try , of course ; but I did catch on to the fact that here , there , she was not looking at this trouble in the same way Mark was or using the same defenses . I delivered the novel , then went to Charlie 's apartment for dinner . While he was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coward . He had made headway , he said ; it was becoming a real thing after two years of too much talk about it . " It 's Katie , " he said . " She 's made it seem possible . I do n't know how . She is hard to please ; and she wo n't let me talk to her . She says , Let me hear it . " He laughed . " So  --  I write something for her to hear . " Two fine steaks were on the table . He was carefully placing braised mushrooms on the plates . " Do you think she 'll marry Sydney ? " I told him I thought so . We settled down to the steaks . After dinner , he played the beginning of the third act for me . Stopped . Said , " That 's it . I ca n't move it on from here . " It seemed the music was not the problem . It was the book . " I ca n't see the resolutionof the coward 's fears . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that he had slipped away from the essential truth of the opera . " Psychologically ? " " In every way . Musically , too . I do n't know how to separate one kind of truth from another . " But he looked confident and his voice sounded confident . Ip146had never seen him in a better mood . And so I left early ; partly , because this time Charlie did n't need my encouragement ; partly , because I had a sermon to finish . Once back in my study , I found myself thinking of Grace . Why not tell them ? It may not work out but the Chief and Neel think it will ; if it does , if Newell withdraws the charges , things are bound to ease for them ; whatever the outcome , it is a spot of good news and they can sure use a little . I turned to dial their number . As I did so , the phone rang . Mark . Could he and Grace come over ? I said yes , of course . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along presently . She was finishing up a few things  --  His voice trailed off . He was looking at me as if formulating a difficult sentence but seemed unable to find the first word . Just stood there . " Sit down . " He walked across the study , looked at the Marin print on the west wall . " Always liked it , " he said , as if he had been away a long time . " Coffee ? " " No , believe not . " He turned away from the Marin , walked over to the fish photograph , looked at it a long time . Said , " Be fine to spend a week on the Gulf  --  right in the middle of it . " " Do you good . " Waiting . " Like to go along with you . " Waiting . He turned toward me , took out his cigarettes , shook one up . " Dave  --  " I saw he could n't make it . I said , " Has something happened ? " " It 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to light it . I had the feeling , again , there was something else he had tried to say first , that he felt he must say . He said , " Some fool has written him a letter . " " About all this ? " He nodded . I waited . He was caught again in thick gluey wordlessness . I tried to throw him a sentence to catch hold of . " We should have expectedsomething of the kind , do n't you think ? " " I guess so . "  | " Anonymous ? " He nodded . No more . " It shook him of course . Have you talked with him ? " " Yes . We both did . " " How did he seem ? " " I 'm not sure . " I saw it had hit him hard . I 'd leave him alone for a few minutes . Struck a match for his cigarette ; then went out in the hall , opened the door , looked across the street , saw their living-room light on , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew she was sitting there thinking what to do next . Or perhaps she had stopped thinking . I saw again that isolated face in front of Walgreen 's . A face like that stops thinking . What I wanted to do was go over and talk to her ; I felt she needed someone to talk to more than he did , maybe . But of course I could n't , so I went back into the study , turned on the electric unit , thinking , We 'll have some coffee when she comes . Diddled around with cups and saucers , fixed a tray , turned off the stove , came back to my chair . He looked better . He said more easily now , " Seems Andy would n't tell what was in it . " Smiled briefly . Said , " Eliot somehow found out it was anonymous . " As he finally told it , it added up to this : The headmaster had called them around nine o'clock . He was relaxed , easy , shielding but said Andy seemed unduly depressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received in the mail that morning . Andy 's housemaster , Eliot , had talked with him a long time , had found out the letter was not signed but Andy seemed unwilling to disclose its contents . Eliot was now at the headmaster 's . They had been discussing the matter . Mark asked if they knew where the letter was from . The headmaster said , Yes , Andy had told Eliot it was postmarked in his home town . The school nurse had seen Andy , he was not sick , she thought , but seemed tense and shaken . She suggested he stay in the infirmary but he did not want to , so Eliot had suggested that he stay with him . Andy was in Eliot 's rooms now . The headmaster thought it was not too serious but the boy was disturbed more , perhaps , than he should be ; if they could reassure him etc. . . . telephone him  --  or better still , perhaps one of them could come up ? They knew , of course , that he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy was in real difficulty . Mark phoned Andy at once , before Eliot had returned to the house . Could get nothing much but yes and no out of him . " Kin to you . " Mark half smiled . " Afraid so . " He had tried to explain about anonymous letters : he said quite a few people receive them these days ; you ca n't take them seriously , they 're written by crazy people or cowards and are usually insulting and full of lies . " But no matter who writes it , " Mark said to me , " you take it seriously when you are thirteen  --  if someone says what I think was said . " " You could n't come straight to the point and ask him . " " How could I ? " " I was stating a fact . It would have pushed him too hard . You ca n't win against a thing like that . " " I kept trying . Told him one of us would fly up in the morning ; that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ; full of dirty words and accusations . " Andy said , " Why , Daddy ? " And Mark had to say he did n't know . He said he probably had an enemy . Then he felt compelled to add that whoever the enemy was , of course he was not actually dangerous  --  just the silly crackpot variety . Then Andy asked why do we have an enemy and Mark had trouble with that one but said there were quite a few people who misunderstood research . Some people did n't approve of the use of animals in lab experiments ; felt it was wrong to deliberately inject cancerous tissue into mice and rabbits . They do n't seem to understand , he told Andy , the importancefor human beings of studying the growth of the disease . Did he perhaps remember the letters in the press last summerwhen the shipment of monkeys arrived ? Andy said he did . " You remember how angry and critical some of those lettersp149were ? " Andy said yes sir . " Perhaps it is one of these people doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked him if he was still on the line , he said he was , and Mark said , " You 're not worrying too much , are you , son ? " " I guess not , " said Andy . Then Grace , listening in on the extension , told him she was coming up on the morning plane . She was terribly sorry about the silly letter but it would be wonderful to sec him so soon . Then she said it , too : " Lots of people , darling , get anonymous letters . They just do . Remember whatever is in yours is a lie . Only a sick , mixed-up person would write one . You understand that , do n't you dear ? " And Andy said , " Yes mam . " As I try to write this down , try to recover their words or the gist of them , I keep thinking about the fragmented quality of human awareness : You take your blindness for granted most of the time then suddenly it stuns you : how little you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to day , year to year  --  vision cut down to the arc of a flickering flashlight , never sure how your words and acts are affecting someone else because you never really see that someone as he is . I know we should find even the most serene life unendurable were we to possess to any real degree those extrasensory perceptions that bridge space which our grandmothers believed in and scientists are now studyingand claiming a few people possess . And yet  --  Well , here they were : and there , a thousand miles away , was Andy : the three of them trying to cross the blankness , unable to perceive what was happening to the others . Had Mark and Grace been able to see that newspaper clipping pasted on a piece of paper which Andy pulled out of a pink envelope  --  but of course they could n't see . And he could not tell them because it stated baldly the fact of his father 's arrest on November 5th , on the charge of making immoral advances to a small girl , and his releaseon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , perhaps , had they known , they could not have done much better than they did.  |p150Anyway   --  Grace plunged on through the dark , saying , " Try not to worry , dear . It is just a silly letter written by somebody who is sick and upset . Whatever is in it is a lie . I 'll explain it when I see you . And Daddy will write you . " Andy 's whispered words , " Do n't come , Mummie , " overlappedhers as she was saying he and Eliot perhaps could drive in to Boston to meet her , they would let Eliot know when the plane was due  --  perhaps there might be a show they could go to " Yes Mummie , " and sobbed and hung up . They both had heard the whisper and the muffled sob . Well , there was n't much to say . This disease of anonymity sweeping across our times  --  this symptom of sharp angry rejectionof personal responsibility is too vast , too complex and hideousin its implications for easy words , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course we were not thinking in those terms at all ; we were staring at a handful of obscene specifics and neither of us knew what to do about them . After a long silence I said , " I suppose you have felt it was better to keep the entire thing from him ? " " Not better . The only thing we knew to do . We 've worried but we did n't see how we could do anything else . I kept believing it would blow over ; that we 'd get it settled somehow ; I guess I was wrong but I believed it . I never lied to the boy in my life , until tonight . Iie knew I was lying . The whole affair is incredible . I ca n't be sure it is happening . " I knew he meant it . Ile had never quite believed it . Not quite . A sliver of his mind knew ; knew he had been accused and arrested but the rest of him had not quite acknowledged it . There was in Mark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a deep rejection of the irrational in human affairs . The laboratory was the world he felt secure in , where facts are collected , scrutinized , tested and retested in relation to other facts , where reason and order and method prevail , where hypotheses are put into strait jackets and not allowed out in the street until they are labeled " true . " That many people live in a world where theyp151do n't bother to check anything and where they ride their hypothesesas if they were hot rods  --  this world , Mark could not fully admit the existence of . He said , " We 'd planned to tell him at Christmas , when we met him at his grandmother 's in Baltimore . We had decided it would n't do to let him come home . " He sat there rubbing the side of his face , staring at the floor . I wondered what was keeping Grace . Then I had the feeling again : he intended to tell me something else , first , and had been unable to . I was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , said quietly , " Someone has to hate you a lot to send a boy a letter like that . " " Do you know anyone who does ? " " No . " " They hate something , of course ; not necessarily you . " He sighed . Did not answer . I thought , They think you 've broken a taboo : that you 've dared do what they have only dared imagine . It makes you radioactive . Every time they hear your name the Geiger countersstart ticking . Naturally , they want to hurt you in the worst possible way . I tried it this way : " Somebody thinks you raped a little girl and he wants you punished , right now . If you 're not , his controls may break down , too . He ca n't wait for you to be tried by the courts , so he becomes judge and jury both , tries you himself and punishes you by raping the mind of your little son . And he feels he 's helping the whole community by doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense : he 's kept himself from committingone sin by committing a worse one . " He was staring at the floor . I was not sure he heard a word I said . " I know I 've made it sound pretty simple . But the man who wrote that letter does n't necessarily have to feel a personal grudge against you . You are a symbol of all he dreads in him-self. "  |p152Ile  was still staring at the floor . " When you become a symbol to people you 're in for bad trouble . " Ile almost smiled . " I see it theoretically . I just ca n't get a grip on it . " We sat smoking . Looking at each other , now and then . Not talking . He said , " We 've always got along fine . The boy and me . You know how we 've been . " Yes , I knew . They 'd fished and hunted together , camped in the Smokies , just the two of them , for a week at a time . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they took a fourdaycanoe trip down the French Broad . They 'd go up to their cabin near Jane 's , on Saturdays , and mess around having a swell time : Mark helping Andy find quartz , all kinds of rocks ; or the two of them squirrel shooting , or taking pictures , or talking about excavations they 'd go on some day in Mexico and Egypt . Everybody knew how they were . " I had to lie to him , but I 've got to set it straight . I think this is between him and me . Grace does n't . She says she is the one to go . She 's packing her bags now . " So that is why she is delayed . " She insists she is the one to do it . It is n't like her . " " No . . . but I think she 's right . " " Why ? " I did n't find it easy to remind him there were questions Andy needed to have answered that he 'd feel he could ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All his life , we 've taught him when he has something to clear up to go straight to the one concerned and do it . If I let Grace do this  --  this thing I should do  --  I know I 'm no good talking about personal things but we would n't have to say much . We have our own way . Good God , Dave , this is almost more than  --  " He swallowed the rest of it . I knew it was hard on him . But I felt she had to do it . A man ca n't defend himself to his young son . I was thinking how mercifullyshe 'd do it , for them both . There were things she needed top153tell the boy about little girls , the way they are warned against men , how it gets on their minds , etc. , their feelings about their bodies ; the kind of woman Renie is , her obsessive fear , or whatever it is , of raping . Mark could never say this , even if he tried . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it in such simple words , Mark . You know how she is . " I know she can talk to him better  --  " " The big thing is he 'll feel how absolutely sure she is of you . " " I do n't think she is . " " How can you say that ! " " Not since  --  " Grace was tapping on the door , was coming in . As she walked in , I got a swift preview of what she will look like when she is seventy years old . Then it was gone . She looked merely tired and pale but not as unrelated as she had that afternoon . She was tied up again with these two . " Dave ? " She smiled , she was under control . I 'd try to keep it easy , casual . " Sit down , dear . We 're getting our ducks in a row . " I asked Mark if he had called the local airport . " Yes . No good connection from here . We can save time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at seven in the morning . I made a reservation . " " Good . Let 's figure a bit . How about letting me take Grace to the airport ? " It was a hundred-mile drive . We should leave close to three-thirty , I thought . We made plans . And as we made them , I watched her face and she watched his . And I saw how much she loved him , it was so plain . His sudden doubt of her worried me . It was to be expected , perhaps : you are accused of a crime that is completely outside the field of your conscious temptations ; you can not conceiveof yourself committing it ; but other people can . Quite easily , apparently . Strangers , of course , who do n't know you . You begin to receive anonymous phone calls and letters . Then you slowly begin to realize that people who know you suspect you , too . Then incredible things happen : you find you are unfit to appear on a TV program ; your professional prestige is strippedp154from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel that only a handful of people in all the world still believe in you and then you are struck again , this time where it is unendurable , because it concerns the son you love , and you turn and begin to fight back by doubting the ones closest to you , those who have stood firmly with you ; you tear them away from you as if you can not bear their belief in you , as if you must now stand alone and abandoned in your agony . It is not only true , I think , that in our agony we feel alone , something in us wants to feel alone . As I watched his face I could believe this might be happening to him : that letter to Andy had gone deep . He said , about here , that he wanted to take her to the airport  --  and she wanted him to , I could see that . I said it seemed to me it might be a good idea for him to go to the lab , as usual . Just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said I had a feeling he wrote that letter . Mark did n't think so and did n't like my saying it , I felt . Mark trusts the people in his lab ; it is not easy for him to believe anyone who works there even on the periphery , even a janitor , would do an irrationalthing like this . Anyway , he could n't see what difference it would make now ; then he said again that S. K. could n't have done it because he could n't have got Andy 's address . I said maybe Mark 's secretary gave it to him . Mark said she would n't . I said she might think he wanted to send his boss 's son a Thanksgivingcard , it would be natural for her to give it to anyone who called up if the request were made in a reasonable way . We pushed our suspicions and certainties back and forth , jabbing them into each other . We got pretty tense over it . I began to feel , Maybe he thinks you just want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do ; but not that way ; sure I want to see if she is all right butI asked him about his bond : would he be permitted to leave town ? He thought so ; I said I did n't know ; why not call Steve ? But nobody did , somehow . Everybody was too tired to think straight ; we jangled each other quite a bit ; but we finally agreed it must not leak out about the letter . It might be better , therefore , for me to take Grace and for Mark to go to the lab at hisp155usual time . We 'd leave at three-thirty ; this would give us a good enough margin ; I 'd get back about eleven , in plenty of time for the funeral of one of my parishioners at twelve . Then Mark asked me if I happened to have any money . He smiled in his old way . "  --  because we have between us exactly seventeen dollars and sixty-five cents . " I had about nine dollars . That would n't help much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I unlocked a desk drawer , took out my security box , gave him the money , one hundred and fourteen dollars , and Mark wrote a check to cover it . I noticed the check was drawn on his savings account . They were running thin , obviously : payments on the house , the boy in school  --  It was like a ghost story  --  one they were being compelled to live out against their will , their strings pulled by invisible hands , as if they were puppets . This raced through my mind in a split second . I turned back , said , " But this wo n't do it . Not a round trip . " Grace could cash a check at the school , he reminded me . " It is OK , Dave , and thanks a lot . " They were standing now . I told them I 'd phone the airport , when my alarm went off , to hold Grace 's space , we were on our way , etc . Mark said he 'd do it ; I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grace was looking at him and he was looking at her . They were talking a swift silent agonized language . It seemed interminable , that dialogue . Finally , Mark pressed his cigarette against the ash tray , dropped it in , picked it up , looked at it , said , " Dave  --  guess I 'd better tell you : I was in the store that after-noon. "  |p156I  felt my mind spin out to a point ... but you did n't harm the child did you ? What I actually said was , " Think we 'd better have some coffee . " I clicked the switch . They stared at me as I walked over to the hi-fi , put on the first record I touched . It happened to be the Brandenburg Fifth . I 'll never forget the awful shock of that joyous confident blast of piano and violin as the thing begins . Grace did not seem to hear a sound . Felt for the hassock as if she were blind , sank down on it . Mark took out a cigarette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were three flat faces . There was nothing warm between us , we had recoiled from each other . I remember how that word store kept pounding meFinally , I had sense enough to turn off the record . Then I said it : " All right . You were in the store . But you did n't harm the child . " Mark swallowed hard , lit his cigarette . Just stared at me . Finally shook his head . " Then spread it out , wo n't you ? Why you went ? Let 's get it down where we can look at it . " As I turned , I saw Grace 's deadwhiteface . " Or can it wait ? " " Let him tell you , Dave . " Mark began : " I went in  --  " Stopped . Walked around the room . He looked crowded  --  a lot of things were pushing  --   | " Mind if I take it from the beginning ? I was on my way for the Cokes ; had no thought except to get them quick as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled up in front of that old store . Saw they were remodeling the place  --  and went in . " " Wait . You walked ? you did n't go in your car ? " " No . Thought the walk would do me good . Takes only four or five minutes . My intention was to buy the Cokes and get home as quick as I could . I 'm sure of this . I had no other thought but this . But I detoured and went in that store . I do n't know why . " He stopped . Looked at her , at me . " I 've thought a hundred times : a machine set to buy those Cokes would have taken the shortest route to Matthews , bought them , turned round , gone home , deposited them on Grace 's kitchen table . Why did n't I ? I do n't know . Guess automation 's brain and mine just  --  I was set to get the Cokes all right , but I must have been thinking about other things , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got me . " You do n't have to tell us why you went in the store . Anybody might have stepped in and looked around . " " I want you to know  --  if I know , myself . Not sure I do . Must have been  --  " " Dave , have you some Scotch ? " She was shaking . I poured a drink for her . " Why do n't you go home and rest a little ? " She whispered no . " I 'm sorry , Mark . " She smiled at him . His face and body had stiffened as if  --  well , I had the absolutely crazy notion he expectedhis plane to crack up any moment . I realized what he was doing now was a near unbearable ordeal . I asked him if he 'd have a drink . He seemed not to hear . " I 'm not talking about the unconscious part of the memory , " he was saying . " I 'm talking about the easyto-get-atpart . Think I went in that place , think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " He picked up his cigarette . Gone out . Dropped it . " But I was n't thinking about Dad . And I did n't smell a thing before I opened that door . Unless the paint , maybe . Not sure ... let 's leave it . What made me stop , turn the latch and go in  --  let 's leave it . " You could see he had retraced his steps a thousand times during these weeks . " Say my muscles pulled me in . Dad was a building contractor . Down in Georgia . Lowndes County was where I was born . Do n't know if I 've ever told you about Dad . " He stopped as if expecting an answer . " No . Do n't think you ever did , " I said . " We were living there when my mother died . There were ponds and lakes everywhere , surrounded by big oaks hanging in moss ; there were cypress in the water , thousands of them , with big swollen knees . Some of the oaks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were like old gray skeletons with long beards of moss . Water was reddish brown . I remembered all that while I was in the store . Do n't know why . Dad used to take me around with him on jobs , after she died . I 'd watch them mix concrete . . . stand there half a day , watching . . . liked the clatter and that thick stuff pouring out of those jaws . I 'd make up stories about it : it was a giant who chewed up rocks and people ; chewed up things that happened  --  and then they had not happened . Must have been about seven when I thought that one up ; remember I felt good , afterward , like I 'd been in swimming . Used to ride the big shovel , too , when Dad had a road job . Sounds pretty dangerous for a kid  --  guess I wanted to and now think I did ; do n't know . Ca n't seem to remember much . He died when I was nine . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's people . " Mark stopped . Looked hard at Grace . Her mouth had opened , a little ; her eyes were looking through him at something else : maybe Andy , maybe the store , maybe she saw a little boy she 'd never heard of before , maybe he saw a little boy he 'd never quite seen before ; I do n't know . I took the glass out of her fingers . She asked for another drink . I gave it to her . He was talking again : " I went in . Wait  --  the door was closed . I went in and shut it after me . I 'm sure I shut it . I 'm sure the place was empty . It wasp159half-dark and not a sound . I looked around . They had torn out the floor to repair the foundation ; termites probably . I saw they had been planing boards . There were pine curls all over the ground . I picked up two or three . Smelled good . Stood there pulling one out , letting it snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , You want to be a silly girl ? why are you doing that ! Grace  --  " he turned to her as if I were not present , " can you believe me ? It was like a dream  --  strong and awful like a dream  --  I must have been about five , maybe : I was in a building he was constructing , the carpenters were planing pine boards and I picked up some curls of wood , a bunch of them , and stuck them under my cap . I thought it made me look like a clown . I was capering around trying to think of something comical to do when he turned on me and said , Take those damned things out of your cap . His eyes were cold and looked as if they could forget and leave me behind . I was scared all right . Funny how scared a kid can get . I remember the carpenters laughing . It seemed to me everything stopped dead . There was a moment when nothing in the world was happening . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . maybe I thought that later , after I was grown . Well , it came back . All this . Had n't thought about it in years . Somehow it bothered me . Think I may have stood a minute or so  --  sort of " Then I saw a row of paint cans  --  on a board laid on two nail kegs . Wall paint , Textron or something . Went over and read the colors : sea gray , foam green , things like that . . . one of them was labeled shell blue . Remember thinking : ought to be shell pink , should n't it ? Thought of a sailboat I used to own  --  well , hardly that ; a boat with a sail , I should say ; could n't remember what became of it . Used to sail down the creek in Ohio  --  anotherboy and me  --  we 'd make like we were going to the Gulf of Mexico and on to Tahiti . Had a second-hand outboard motor . We 'd take a can or so of baked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out overnight . Remember the tree frogs . Other things . A cow  --  there was a cow walking around as we lay there on the grass one night  --  remember she  --  oh well ; and Bill died laughing and it did n't seem funny to me  --  tried top160laugh but it did n't seem funny  --  just seemed a lot of it  --  rememberlooking at the sky and wondering why he laughed  --  rememberthe Big Dipper was bright that night , remember I thought , I 'm going to fly an airplane someday , going to fly all around the world and to the moon maybe . And I lay there dipping the wings , nose-diving , climbing , banking , doing everything I 'd seen in movies , while all outer space watched me  --  I sort of thought it was watching . " He stopped . Caught in it , again . Grace 's eyes were full of tears ; she had not moved ; just looked at him . He went on , " Could remember everything but what became of my boat ; whether I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it were a problem I must solve . Strange , how you can forget a thing , seems like I would  --  " He walked across the room , turned , walked back . " Then I pried the lid off that paint can . Sure enough , stuff was blue . Looked like it might taste good . Put the lid on . Rememberpressing it down hard  --  air 's not good for paint . Then I sat down on a stack of lumber . Was smoking . Remember telling myself , be careful with that cigarette . " Just sat there . In that half-dark place . Ca n't see why Grace or anybody would believe it . " I saw he had to tell every detail . He had been sealed up so long : it was all or nothing , now . He looked at her , at me . " I 'd been in the lab pretty much , lately . Good many evenings . It was so near done , this phase , I did n't want anything to go wrong . Must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it ? last summer ? when you first mentionedhim ? " I had forgot that . I think I merely said , There 's something about your janitor that bothers me ; he seems afraid he 'll catch cancer . What the man had said to me was , " Better wash your hands when you leave this place , Mr. Landrum . " Mark smiled . " Oh , not much but  --  one day I saw him tilting the museum jars that contain the breast tumors . Rocking them back and forth . Queer look in his face . May have imagined it but  --  Anyway , I spoke to him pretty sharp . Told him never top161touch them ; he said he was just looking ; told him to keep his hands off . He muttered , walked out . Saw him another time looking at the mice . We had planted tissue in five , that day . Covered the implantations with Algire chambers  --  you put a fold between plastic plates . I think you 've seen them out there . I caught S. K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told him not to handle the mice . He seemed to resent it . Oh , I do n't think there 's any harm in him . Only thing that bothers me , it seems to hold a peculiar fascination for him . But I 've made a point of coming in now and then at night when he 's cleaning , just to be sure . " But that Monday  --  I came home early . I wanted to think about something else . I remember that . I was suddenly tired of the lab , I wanted to forget it . That 's why I helped Grace plant the bulbs . I wanted to see something else growing besides cells , I guess . Maybe that 's why I went in the store : to smell lumber , paint , see building going on " He was caught again , for a few seconds . " Anyway , I sat there , looking around . " Then I remembered Dad 's last job : a six-story office building . Not much of a skyscraper but it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me ride it soon as it was installed . Let me punch the button : up , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ; down . . . . Can see those numbers and Dad half smiling ; never saw him smile a whole smile in my life . " He stopped , looked away . Came back . " Well , that 's about it , I guess . I dropped the cigarette . Checked to be sure it was dead . Started out the back door  --  that 's where I was : near it . Saw a latrine in the corner rigged up for the workmen , stepped in to use it . No door . A flap of canvas . Did n't bother to drop it . Place half-dark . Nobody but me . Then  --  as I turned around , I saw the kid : standing right there in front of me . She had a yellow cat in her arms  --  I swear she did . She did n't move . She was looking straight at me . She said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you dare ! ' I turned away quick  --  could n't work the zipper  --  kept trying  --  it would n't  --  all in my mind was to get out of the damned place . Then things happened so fast I do n't know what came first : she screamed  --   |p162terrible  scream  --  cat jumped out of her arms and landed on the lumber , and then instead of running away the kid ran up to me and began to heat on me like crazy . Her hands beat like sticks . I dodged and went out that door as if a thousand witches were after me . Ran down the alley . Saw I was near Matthews , braked up , caught my breath , went in the back door , got the Cokes , paid a cashier , cut across the street and hurried back to the house . You know the rest : I opened two Cokes , added the rum , gave a glass to Grace and took one out on the terrace . " I poured him a drink . He gulped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by each of them , took mine over to the window to give him time to level off . I tried not to think . Something in my mind seesawed and whanged but I would n't listen . I stood at that window and stared at the rhododendron below the ledge . Watched a car come up , park thirty feet beyond  --  under the big sycamore . Taillight on . Nobody got out . When I came back from the window he and Grace were looking down at the floor . Grace rubbing her fingers . Here I begin to blur . I find it almost impossible to recall our words from here on . I mean the way they built up . The tensions press today as if it happened yesterday ; but the sudden mood we slipped into , my state of mind I should say , seems in retro/spect so melodramatic that I can scarcely believe my own memory . For instance , that book : why it loomed as large as it did , why I felt I had to say all I said . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one cigarette or two while you were there ? " I asked . " One . " " You thought about quite a few things on one cigarette . " His voice was calm and courteous . " Yes . Seems like I did . " Not a sign of defensiveness . He said , " Believe it was like this : you remember events simultaneously , a lot of them , sometimes . They just operate on different levels . " " It happens like that , Dave . " Her voice was pleading . She reminded me how you wake up , look at the clock , go hack to sleep , have a long involved dream , wake up and find only a minutehas passed . " Remembering is like that . It comes all at once . " " Sure it does . I 'm trying to see how the others may shape it up . Mark , you were in the place ten or twelve minutes ? " " Probably . Not sure . May not have been that long . " " Mind telling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't , did you ? " He did not answer at once . Grace shook her head . He was sitting in the striped chair . He felt around for his cigarettes , found the package , kept his fingers on it , did not take one out . Stared at the package . Then he turned to me . " When it happened I was bowled over . No man wants a little girl  --  But I did n't think beyond that . Did n't dream anything would come of it . Did n't recognize the kid as belonging to anybody I knew . It was one of those things that just do n't happen . When it finally does , you try to forget it . " Thought I 'd tell Grace . Sometime . Had no idea  --  I had n't done a thing , so did n't worry . Or if I did , I did n't know it . By the time I walked home I could laugh , not much I admit , but  --  well , I must have looked an all-fired ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't too upset . Would have told Grace , right then , if I had been . "  |p164But  later  --  when you were accused , why did n't you tell her ? The question pounded my brain but I could not ask it . " I said to myself , " Mark still explaining , " forget it forget it , went out on the terrace , drank the rum and Coke and read my hook . " " What were you reading ? " " The Possessed . " " Dostoevsky 's Possessed ? " " Sure . " This is when it started . I had been as certain of him as of anyone in the world . But the name of that book did it . I can not explain it . Except to say it unloosed something . Perhaps not it alone ; perhaps it was the book linked on to the knowledge that he had held the other back , until now . I knew his reading it was pure coincidence . I was sure of it . They both read a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitehead or Unamuno or Berdyaev , but why not Dostoevsky ? if he wanted to , why not ? Just the same , my whole organism took a leap and landed on a more irrational level  --  not only my mind but my glands , too , for my heart was hammering and my head felt tight . And as I remember things now , I feel my senses were distorted : I saw things too black too white too large too small too out of shape , somehow . I looked at Grace . Her eyes had turned into black holes . She has so much empathy  --  I feel she caught it from me , the doubt , suspicion  --  but not as formulated as those words suggest  --  perhapslack of confidence is a better way to say it . I was no longer sure of him ; I felt she was no longer sure : and now I feel  --  not then , but now  --  that a new gestalt was forming : we had looked at the Mark We Know , now we were looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak ; decided not to . " Is something the matter , Dave ? " Mark 's voice was the only sane sound in my head . " No . Not a thing . I just thought  --  " " What is it , Dave ? " Her voice was urgent . " Nothing of importance . " Relieved that my voice soundedp165easy . " I was merely wishing you had read  --  something else . " Neither said anything . Then I said , " Does anybody know you were reading it ? " " They do n't , do they ? You did n't mention it , did you , Mark ? " Grace 's voice was low and frightened . Mark has one of the fastest mental take-offs I know . But always when things get personal he goes into that slow motion . He looked at her , at me . He seemed to have lost every word in his language . But he finally made it . He said , " No . I  --  did n't . As far as I know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're getting at , Dave . " " As I say , it 's not important . I was just wondering why you happened to be reading that hook . Instead of something else . " He looked at me hard . Looked at her . " This is why : because Grace was saying , while we planted the bulbs , that she had just reread Virginia Woolf 's translation of Stavrogin 's Confessionand she thought it  --  oh I do n't know ; what 's the use  --  " He sighed , rubbed his face . Grace took it up . " I was talking about its strange tranquillity . Mrs. Woolf 's translation . Its theme is  --  but her words create a curious calm . I said it was like a deep undersea calm with the storm raging on the surface , then I switched and said I believed it was the other way around : a calm surface with a terrible undertow and suction underneath it . Then I said , it seemed more than Dostoevsky when she had done with it . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I went on to say , I wish she had done a translation of Crime and Punishment . You know , the way we talk about things . " " You were reading the Confession ? " My tone must have been inquisitorial . " No . But what 's wrong with reading it , for God 's sake ! " " Do n't you see ? " " No I do n't . " He walked over to the window . Why did n't he ? It had stabbed me like a chest pain . This Thing : I could see it dim , way off : Stavrogin and the little girl he seduced and raped : her terror her grief her shame her guilt , her slow slow and then , so quick death . And its shadow :  |p166Mark  and another little girl . . . . It blazed up in my mind like a picture on fire . Then died down to slow smoldering words : they were talking about Stavrogin and his confession . . . no , it was Woolf 's prose they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they both knew the Stavrogin story . . . suppose Mark ... suppose the power of that story , the steep downward-spiralingstairs Dostoevsky makes you lean over . . . suppose thinking about it had released a locked-up impulse , had pushed him down to another level of feeling , into a savage , dark place , way down where the conscience can not exert its controls , or your sense of reality  --  suppose  --  yes , but a book ca n't  --  maybe it can  --  but this book evokes pity terror stirs your conscience your moral sense not your sadism not desire not  --  but maybe it was already stirred , the desire , the need  --  What am I letting myself  --  thechild was not hurt , you know that ! " Dave . " Voice a whisper . I felt she might have called me several times . " Nobody knows he read it . I 'll burn it . " Mark turned on her . I 'd never seen him like that . " What 's come over you two ? would you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it would help you and Andy . " She tried to hide her crying . " I 'm scared . " He looked at her gravely ; then smiled and said , " I 'm scared too , honey  --  but not because I read a book and think somebody 's going to find out about it . You two do n't actually think the police would search our house to see what books we read in order to decide whether I tried to seduce a little girl ? " Grace said , " Somebody might . Whoever sent that letter to Andy might . Whoever phones me . " She was deeply disturbed and showed it . All along she had been poised and steady . NowI felt it was my fault . I tried to put the brakes on . I said , " Grace , if S. K. wrote that letter  --  and I think he did  --  he would n't know Dostoevsky from Mickey Spillane . " " Yes he would . The evsky would do it ; he 'd say we were Communists and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us both . He said , " Let 's take it easy . "  |p167He  reminded us that nobody could have been more reasonable than Neel ; that the Chief was all right , too . He told us Steve Bernstein had informed him that the judge was widely known for his fairness and happened to be , also , a subtle sophisticated man who knew his way around in human nature . " The people who count are sensible  --  let 's hold on to that . There 's nothing new in the situation to cause us to panic . " Except you were there ; and the child did n't make it up ; and you read that book ; and somebody , a dozen , maybe a hundred people who do n't count , and some who do , are stirring things into a mess  --  how about those letters and calls to Grace , and now to AndyIt bothered me , this sudden evasion . Mark knew as well as I did that the man or woman who wrote that letter to Andy was out to hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt she had stopped listening to us . She seemed to be hearing something else . She said , " Mark  --  do you think Andy 's all right ? I 'm afraid he 's not all right .... " " He 's sound asleep , honey . And Eliot 's with him . Nothing could possibly happen to him tonight . " She stared at the closed door . I had an irrational feeling , for a moment , that she had walked through it and had gone away . I said , knowing as I said it that it was not perhaps a wise thing to say , " I 'd like to know who sent that letter to Andy . If we knew we might see who is whipping the froth up . " " Some crackpot . You said so , yourself , a while ago . There 're always crackpots everywhere who do these things . " Grace was pale , distraught , and seemed under enormous tension . I should have let them go home . But I forgot her , he forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose we were too worried to know what else to do but talk . I said , " It 's not just the crackpots stirring things up . A lot of people ca n't think straight about a thing like this , who can think straight about everything else . Sensible , astute businessmen whose judgment is good on most matters will fall fiat over this . "  |p168I  was thinking of Dewey Snyder , of the vestrymen , and some of those on the Cancer Drive Committee . " It is because  --  " Well , I was n't sure I knew . So I stopped here . " Why ? " " I 'm not sure . We 've talked about it before . When it gets close , it is not easy to see  --  It is different from breaking the law . Or breaking a moral law . It 's deeper ; goes way down . Beyond words , probably . Take killing , for instance : killing is not taboo . People think it is wrong , sometimes ; but not always . They think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war , in H-bomb tests  --  But this kind of thing is wrong all the time , in people 's minds . " " You 're talking as if I raped the child or had been accused of raping her . " " In a lot of people 's minds you did rape her . That 's the point I 'm trying to make . That 's why the book worries me . Suppose it does come out in the testimony that you were reading it : think what a jury could do with it . " I could see those twelve men hunched up reading it ; minds already inflamed with half-repressed fantasies ; most , maybe all , reading it for the first time . They 'd identify him with Stavrogin , they 'd strip all the differences off and merge the two as the Guilty One  --  unless , unless by some miracle , they identified him with themselves . Then , of course , they 'd believe him innocent . Neel thought they might do this because quite a few men are being framed by little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable , just here ; there was a chance that they 'd identify with him . It would depend , of course , on how much they felt they had in common with him . Would they feel they had much in common with a scientist ? with a man who had entertained Negro scientists in his home ? whose wife is an artist and modern dancer and has had her picture made with a Negro ? I did n't know . I said , " Make up your mind . It ca n't be that book . How about the New York Times ? You take it ; you were reading the theater page . " He laughed . I did , too . But I meant it.  |p169He  was studying me now . " You thought that , did n't you ? about the Confession ? that if I read it , I might then have  --  hurt the child ? " " I thought it . I do n't believe it . " Was that true ? " But if the others thought it they would believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I be damned . " Well , it got me . Partly because I was shaken by his having been in the store and the fact that he had not told us ; shaken , too , that I had felt suspicion . I did n't like having felt it ; of course I did n't . It put me right down with Snyder . Just the same , it seemed to me he was riding too smooth on his innocence  --  ignoring too much that just could n't be ignored . I see it now . It was necessary for him to tunnel in and go ahead without looking anywhere except in front of him . That is how he endured those two years in a Jap prison ; how he carried out those missions over the Hump through sleet ice snow with Jap fighters tailing him . How he had kept on with his work at the lab , these weeks , behaving as if he were n't worried , as if everything were going to be all right . He knew he was innocent . He believed people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared . Once cleared , his life would smooth out and the work at the lab would go on and his normal life with Grace and Andy would begin again . He was compelled to keep acting on this assumption  --  even though he was now living , and knew it , on a level of human affairs where men rarely behavereasonably and rarely are just . But I could n't see it , that night ; and I resented the seeming moral arrogance in his calm attitude  --  as if I were the one who had done wrongI did n't answer him . I suppose he felt my reaction . He looked up , sighed , said , " I 'm sorry , Dave . We came here for help because we need it bad ; and if anybody in the world will help us , I know you will . I seem muddle-headed , somehow . I have the greatest respect for you  --  including your imagination . " He smiled in his old easy way . " You know that . Your hunches are usually good , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hope you know that , too . "  |p170I  told him to forget it . Told him maybe I worried about S. K. and Miss Hortense  --  I had not mentioned her but I had thought about leer  --  because I saw too many people like them , every day . ( I was worried more about Dewey Snyder , but decided not to mention him . ) But in spite of our quieter words , I did not feel good . I felt , What else is he holding back ? I was n't sure . And I wanted to get things straight . It was late but I said , " Mind going back a hit ? Did you tell the police or the magistrate you were in the store ? " " No . " " Did they ask you ? " " Yes . I said I was not in the store ; I was at Matthews . " Now Grace was listening to us . " What else could he have said , Dave ? " " I do n't know . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the truth . We live that way . Then a time comes , you just ca n't tell it . " " Because they 'll take the part of it that fits what is in their minds and discard the rest . I seem to have jumped over on your side of the argument . They 'd believe I was in the store if I said I was ; sure ; but they 'd never believe I sat down on a pile of lumber and thought about things that happened thirty years ago . " " But why perjury ? You do n't have to give evidence against yourself . " " Two minutes ago , you wanted me to lie and tell them I 'd been reading the New York Times . Now you  --  " He stopped , rubbed his face . " I know I do n't have to give evidence against myself . But suppose I had refused to answer that question  --  what would they have thought ? " We did n't bother to say it . " What I think I did was withhold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need . That 's not double talk . I do n't like perjury any more than you do . But what they needed to know was this : ( a ) was the child hurt ? ( b ) did I hurt her ? The answer is no . I did n't hurt her nor was she hurt . But if I told them I was in that store  --  that one fact would pushp171all the other facts out where they could n't be dealt with , no matter how relevant they might be . There 're facts and facts . You know that , Dave . Inside a man , outside him . Some you can measure ; some you ca n't . We forget the dangerous facts are those that do n't speak a modern language : those that can talk only to the primitive part of us . You believe this  --  even more than I do . " Of course . That was why I was worried about the book . That was why I worried about him , for until this moment he had seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then she said it : " Dave , you would n't tell the truth , would you , if they called you as witness ? " We laughed , Mark and I. We had to . It was an incredible mess and painfully real and close  --  for Andy was on the periphery of our thoughts every moment we talked . But I must admit I had been wishing Mark had not told me . I said , hoping it was true , " I would not be required to divulge what is , in effect , a confession he has made to his priest . " She was as direct as a child : " But would you still say you saw him on the terrace at five-thirty ? " I evaded her  --  and my conscience . Said , " Was that why you did n't tell us , Mark ? " Once more , he studied his cigarette . Said , " When Neel walked in our house that Wednesday night and asked his questions , I did n't have time to think . And I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , " to feel sure of me . " She turned to him quickly . Her face , all of her , said everything a man needed to hear . " That first time , it was reflex  --  my saying I had n't been in the store . And after you said you saw me on the terrace at fivethirty  --  But when we talked to Andy , I knew I had to tell you both . I could n't handle it any longer by myself . " It was late . But we sat there  --  each of us withdrawn and silent . As I think about it now , there was a curious emptiness in that room  --  as if we had left it , one by one . Finally , Mark looked up , said , " It 's strange how she knew my name . I 'd never been around her . "  |p172I  told then : I was about to phone when they asked to come over . Then I told them about Renie and Susan hiding behind the rose bushes , watching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into the house . Told them the Chief and Neel had decided to try to persuade the Newells to drop the charges , for the sake of the child . Neel had never believed in the validity of the case . " When I told them about Susan 's visit to my rooms  --  I ca n't go into it now ; perhaps some other time  --  Neel agreed with me , and the Chief , too , with a few reservations , that Susan had fantasied the whole thing with her mother 's collaboration . I was sure of it . Am afraid I did a first-class selling job on her talent for lying  --  plus the fact that you could not possibly have been in the store because I saw you on your terrace at five-thirty . " I looked at Grace . She almost smiled . " They said they would talk to Claud Newell this weekend . I promised them I would , also . We were sure we could persuade him to withdraw his charges . I had hoped it would be good news for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a muscle moved in Mark 's face . She said , " I must go . Stay as long as you need to , Mark . I 'll be all right . Night , Dave dear . " Mark stood up . " Thanks , Dave . I  --  Thank you very much . I 'll run along . " IIc put his hand on my shoulder , his eyes tried to say something but I was not sure what . We agreed , once more , on three-thirty . They left . I walked over to the desk . Was unable to think what I wanted there . Saw Grace 's glass and cup . That put a thought in my head : wash them . I picked up the things and washed them . Turned off the light , started upstairs . I had not locked the window . Decided it might be a good idea since I 'd be away the next day . The light from the hall was sufficient to see by . Went over to the window . As I locked it , someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked at the sycamore tree and drove off . It happened before my eyes could adjust to the dark . I173thought it was a man ; do n't know ; have never found out . And , I must admit , I have never given it much thought since . At three o'clock the alarm went off . I turned on the light , fumbledaround for the phone to call the airport , remembered Mark was to do it . Went in the kitchen , put on the water for coffee . Got under the shower to wake up . Then did the bacon while the coffee dripped . Drank coffee and ate strips of bacon as I dressed . Saw a light on in their kitchen and decided there was time to pack my vestments . Knew I should take them along in case of a delay : I could then come into town on the west side , save thirty minutes on the cross-town route to the funeral home where the services for Mrs. Bailey were to be held . I pulled out the vestment case . Went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cassock . Pushed through pants , coats , topcoats , jackets : no cassock . Looked again . Thought of Susan  --  I knew she had not taken it but I thought of her . Susan and that clothes closet were now tied in a hard knot . ( I do not know why I pull these inconsequential details to the surface of my mind ; perhaps because I tend to hang on to trivia when the big things begin to speed around the curves . ) Anyway , I gave up , plugged in the razor  --  and at the first burr remembered the cassock was at the cleaners . There was one of the same weight in the robing room . I 'd go over and get it , and pick up a stole . Shaving now . Thinking of small affairs . But Susan stayed inp174my mind . Last night , she had not mattered much . It was Andy , Mark , Grace . Now , she began to assume importance . It was beginning to come to me that she might be in more trouble than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had all the breaks , until now ; and Grace would straighten him out ; I did not minimize his hurt or the shock  --  I knew nothing , of course , about the newspaper clipping  --  but I felt his relationship with his parentswas basically good and because it was they would work it out . And I had realized  --  belatedly , I 'm afraid  --  that I was Susan 's priest , too ; and the child needed a friend . Last night , she was no more than a name to me . We mentionedher again and again but I do n't think we felt her as a person . She was an obstacle we tried to shove out of our way . At this bare hour between night and dawn , she came clear : her small sharp face pushing as if nothing ever opened up easily for her ; eyes changing color as mood changed ; her absurd pretense of sophistication , hysterical giggle , quicksilver imagination  --  it appealed to me , suddenly . Well , she had sure prowled the neighborhood : must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's too . Openingdoors , opening drawers , looking at herself in other people 's mirrors  --  I could see her preening . . . staring . . . preening  --  behind her a different room , a different world , each time . Inside her mind  --  what ? Something vague like cloud pictures ? A little one-act play , maybe ? I do n't know . The kind of kid who might steal , too . Not because she wants it but because she needs somethingwhose name is not in her vocabulary ; so she settles for the synonyms : running off with a box , a ring , watch , pin , thimble , a hat , a picture , a dollar , maybe . . . . But I had not missed a thing from my rooms . It is possible she had been in that store before , talking to the carpenters . Many times , perhaps . Which one of them would admit it now ! She was , apparently , on familiar terms with that old yellow cat . All the alley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those little journeys . Who would n't ? Then , one day , one Monday afternoon , her search collided with Mark 's : both , lookingin that old place for something needed : Susie , wanting whatp175she had never had ; Mark ? I do n't know  --  was it what he had lost long ago ? How little I know about this man who is my closest friend ! One edge of his life , one edge of mine have touched . That is all . And yet , we thought we knew Susan  --  at least enough to name her . To everybody , she was The Pest . There had been moments , as she sat in the fourth pew making faces at me while I tried to preach , when I had thought up stronger names than that for her . The child seems to bring out the worst in every grown person she meets . You keep trying to figure out why . Maybe she knows something we used to know and pretend we 've forgot and she reminds us , by a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to " the brotherhood . " 1 do n't know . But I do know : had a sensitive intelligent dog sought his owner , say ; had he kept looking for him or for something that belonged to him , coming in with a shoe or sock or old sweater , we 'd be moved by his devotion and need and we 'd pat him and say nice doggie , and the rest of it . But when Susie does it , she 's the Menace to everybody , including me . I was shaving under my eyes now . Saw how black they were . They had always been black , of course ; but I had concentrated on Susie 's pale yellow eyes until I was a bit startled to see my own staring back at me . Mark . . . I could see his eyes , too  --  when I let myself . They were tense last night ; pupils dilated . I knew things were crowding him harder than he would admit . And Grace  --  something snapped in her when I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? My brain was twanging like a piece of elastic ; when that happens , you do n't know what sounds will come out of your mouth . Odd . . . how you try to think of a situation as one : when it is always two , three , four , five and so on . Totally different events had happened to those two in that store . Had begun there . . . now  --  Yet we try to make them one . We hunger for form : but we have so little sense of form . Last night , Mark kept saying she was not hurt . The kid just was n't hurt , he said . Simpler that way for him , I guess , not to think about it . And yet , had the incident been intentional , it could scarcely have  --   |p176I  saw her as she was , in my study : scrunched up in my armchair , making up her stories about toadstools and parasols , Boody and Renie and a Chicago hotel room-phone ringing and Mark 's following her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only one of us who had told the truth about the store . In spite of my brainwashing , she 'd stuck to it . I 'd lied about the fivethirtyterrace business  --  unintentionally , the first time ; afterward , I guess I did it deliberately ; and I 'd lie more if I talked to Claud Newell and I had to talk to him ; and if there is a trial I shall  --  Well , I do n't know . Mark had lied to everybody and would keep it up . The only disagreement we had was which thing to lie about . The whole mess was unreal , incredible . It made me sick . I felt we were caught in the nets of somebody 's Big Lie struggling to cut our way out with dull little lies , and we 'd never do it . Why could n't we think straight ? Putting on my dog collar now , and rabat . A clergyman 's puzzled solemn face stared back at me from the mirror . I turned away . As a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a fine case he and I concocted about Susie : except it just was n't true . We were sincere in thinking it was . But it was n't . Makes you feel pretty silly . Worse : it scares you to watch yourself make escalators of theories and push every lost human being you know on one , hoping they will soon be out of your sight . Well , I was the one riding the escalator  --  not Susie . Susie was the sanest one in the lot . She knew she needed something : she tried in her child-way to find it , and she had n't hurt anybody . She had not intended hurt  --  but of course she had hurtIt was Renie . Renie . . . Neel had done a demolition job on my image of Renie : Red-blonde hair pulled back in a shining smooth chignon , her stunning classic face , slim neat figure , warm laugh , helpfulness to people , her engaging sense of humor about small things  --  I had not forgot that night in my study but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tried to hold to , feeling you ca n't let everything good you 've known about a person slide down the drain . Well , it had slid , all right . As I thoughtp177her name now , Renie 's face turned slowly into Hattie Belle 's cheap lush cosmetic-smeared calculating face . Hattie Belle . . . take those Dior clothes off Mrs. Newell , get her out of her British tweeds , add ten pounds to her , put her in a cheap dress from a chain store and you 've got Hattie Belle  --  his voice snipping like a tailor 's shears ; his eyes agonized . He loved that bitchy sister of his  --  it was so plain  --  and he believed he despised her . I stood there in my room , tangled in the maze of Neel 's feelings . I pulled away . You ca n't begin on Hattie Belle . . . . Yes , Renie held Susie 's hand while she lit the fuse . Gave her the match , all right . But where did the fuse come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were detonating in heart after heart , mind after mind ? I felt , It is going to rock us all before it is done with . Immediately , I told myself to take it easy . Things like this have happened before , hundreds of times : if they can make a case that sticks with the jury the man is sent to prison and that is that ; if they ca n't , they free himBut this man is Mark . . . . What a difference a name makes to you . A dread began to press me . Free him  --  f or what ? I saw it was three-twenty . Slipped on a tweed coat . Hurried out . Drove around the corner to the church . Went in to pick up the cassock . Turned the lights on only in the small robing room and at the side entrance . Suddenly , it was as if the whole church were lighted up : altar , Cross , candles , reredos , pulpit , lectern , choir stalls , nave , baptistery  --  windows glowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of it opened up in my mind so swiftly and completely , as I turned to lift the robe off its hanger , that I was transfixed . For a minute or more I stood there in that dim cold anteroom , caught in a radiance that slowly illumined my heart and mind and memory : All of it , all the Church had meant to me , all I called my religion was there : its heart-twisting words whispering , the great and terrible Moments of the Last Supper , the Passion , the Cross , the Atonement ; the Holy Trinity . . . . All this : all that the Church had meant to me when I was a small boy hungry for something bigger than a man to believe in , straining toward something more lasting thanp178my small present , yearning to come closer to a goodness that I dimly apprehended but had no word for ; all it had meant in my teens ; in college , when the feeling was somehow transformed into concern for my fellow-man , and then had changed again into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men die in the war  --  for I believed my own words when I told the dying that God was not indifferent to a man 's death ; even as I lay embitteredand hopeless on the hospital bed after the leg was torn off , I had still clung to something , hardly more than a sliver of Place , still and wordless and swept clean , but it had caught my heart firmly and had held me ; all this suffused me and surroundedme and I felt as if I were about to be lifted to anotherorder of feeling and perceiving and living , that a wisdom was about to be revealed to me  --  And then , the illumination dimmed and faded ; and I was left alone in that cold small room standing there with my hand on a limp black robe . And everything was as it had been . I felt emptied out . Cut off from the Presence of God . And I wanted to cry as a child cries when his small view of things is blown out by sudden windy events . I switched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought , It will return  --  the illuminationwill return if I see the real altar , real Cross , the real  --  I walked up closer to the altar . I wanted to kneel and pray , to bend my body , yes , and my mind , in genuflection to what is beyond my comprehension , beyond this obscene hour we were caught in and the small ineffectual way we were responding to it . I can not kneel now , although I desperately needed to . But I stood there and prayed : clumsily , agonizingly : for compassion , forgiveness , courage . ( How reluctant is one 's vocabulary ! In my anguish it released only those three words . ) And then , I went into the small room again , took the cassock from its hanger and hurried out into the night , feeling I had prayed the wrong prayer , feeling I should have asked God for much more and much less . And yet , how could I ? I did not know what that more was , nor the less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be revealed to me . And I , too , was lost ; I no longer understood the meaningp179that the Church has for this time we live in ; I no longer understoodmy relationship with God . I stare at these words as I write them down now for they have a pitiful and arrogant look . How can a man understand his relationship with God ? when he does not even understand his relationship with his own mother or father ; or the woman he chooses to live his life with ; or her children he works for ; or his friend ; or his relationship to the earth he walks on , or that vast unlighted unknown part of his own self which stretches back into his childhood and on and on into the limitless past of the human childhood . Understand ? It is like saying , 1 do not understand a form that is round , or the smell of violets , or the smell of dung , I do not understand the sounds that streamed out of Beethoven 's head , or the love of a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hand holding me steady , giving me direction : I had believed in something that seemed enormously significant to me . And I had loved something beyond my own self . Had I then said my belief aloud it would certainly have sounded naive in its minute concreteness and wondrously vague in its generalities . But somehow , it had form , and it held me ; it gave me not purpose but a sense of purpose , not a destination but a sense of direction . But every year one 's belief changes  --  or is it one 's love ? I do n't know . But I do know this : when the heart expands , when the imagination opens , when the memory becomes more aware , when the mind grows or one 's personal relationships acquire depth and complexity , this changes one 's relationship to God . " God " is a symbol for God , as Paul Tillich has said many times . Yes . A symbol of a symbol of a symbol , I think it must be : But that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be created anew  --  for it can not be discovered  --  by each of us and as continuously as our bodies and minds and spirit are re-created . What I had not done was keep on creating and being re-created , and nowNow : At this moment we needed , I needed and Grace and Mark and Andy , and Susan  --  and her mother , too  --  needed somethingwe did not possess . And Those Others , the anonymousp180ones who seemed to be causing most of this fantastic trouble : what had my Church and I as its priest done to transmute their fevered sick imaginations and impulses into mystical yearning and creative act ? Unformed words piled up in my mind and pressed hard . As I try now to translate that pressure into words , it seems to me I feared that perhaps the liturgical beauty of the Church , its tradition , its poetry , its awesome rituals of penitence and need had seduced me . The Church can be prison more easily than door . Perhaps it was prison to me . This feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unendurable . I got in the car , deeply troubled , and estranged . As I turned the ignition key and started the motor I thought , Something has gone wrong with us all . I had little idea of what I meant . But I resolved to take a day or two off as soon as I could manage it ( when this trouble was over , I meant ) , borrow Jane 's cabin up on the mountain and try to think it out ; try to find what had gone wrong with me , at least . A day or two ? Sure . Keep it small and sensible . Always , something urges me to keep it small and sensible as I reach out for the big realization , the Great Form . Something always urges me to think it out clearly when I know I can do no more than open myself up so that wisdomor vision or simple goodness and love may enter me at its appointed time . Religion is a creative act , a discovery , as is an artist 's painting or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard nub in me stubbornly refuses this knowledge ; and I keep trying the down-to-earth approach and I end with my mouth in the mud . As I went across Arlington and into the Channing driveway , I saw them waiting in the cold dark of the terrace . I slowed , brought the car to a stop . They turned to each other . Mark took her in his arms . I believed their minds were as close as their bodies . I felt it , and I was relieved . Last night I had not been sure . There had been a few minutes when  --  but I could have imagined that . Now , things had leveled off , I could see it . And I was glad , for I cared more for these two than for anyone else onp181earth and I had begun to realize , during these weeks , how entwinedmy life was with theirs . And yet  --  as I walked toward them I felt completely outside their lives . Strange . . . how it happens : cold , dark , silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watcher stands there , a million miles from human warmth , drifting farther and farther away in his loneliness . I know : the milk of that loneliness has nourished all the poetry and art and music and magic and mysticism , and science , too , maybe , this old human world has created for itself ; but it can be a sour thing in one 's own mouth . I was almost overpowered by my feeling of isolation : I envied these two their brutal dilemma , was jealous of their tearing anxiety about the boy : at least it was theirs ; it was real ; they were suffering but they were living out the deep human thingsMark picked up her bags . They met me halfway clown the walk . We went to the car . Mark got her settled while I put the luggage in the car trunk . " I 'll call you , dear  --  and take care , " she said . And he kissed her again and turned to me , " OK , Dave ? " I said , " Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything was and would always be . It is like that , my voice : confident , sure , hopeful ; I have nothing to do with it ; it 's the shape of the larynx or something , the way my palate wobbles , maybe . ( They used to tell me at the Seminary that sooner or later it was bound to make me a bishop . Fine joke ; sure . ) I hated the sound of it , now , as it reached my ears . He stood there as I backed down the drive . Was standing there when I slowed to make a left turn as I cut into Briarcliff . I gave her a cigarette . Did the things you do to make a woman comfortable , seeing about coat , handbag , and so on . And then I drove up the highway past dark streets dark houses on on until we were out of the city and in the country . The sense of being completely cut off from all that counts in a personal sense  --  how shall I say it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settledp182down on me . I could n't shake it off . I could not talk . It was cruel timing : this : cutting across that sudden crashing sense of loss I had felt in the robing room . Perhaps both feelings were one . I do n't know . But it bore down . I was ashamed but I could not pull free of it . Ten miles  --  perhaps it was  --  later , she said , " Dave ? " I drove a half-mile before I could say , " Yes ? " " You mean so much to me . To both of us . " Not the words but the voice said what counted . She was answering my mood ; she always seems to feel you . Always she 's like that . Yes , he means something as a friend , as their priest , sure ; but not  --  What else do you want ? But I did n't ask it , I stifled it before I quite heard it inside my head . I took her hand . I intended only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about . It is a thin strong hand , used to working with clay , stone , paint ; used to washing dishes and cooking and the rest of it for Grace does her own work and those other things , too . ( She is not too neat about it , I must say ; she 's likely to shove a stack of canvases under the couch , a pile of messy drawing paper , plus a piece of wet clay ; and the dishes may stay in the sink for two days ; but she 's a good cook ; and anybody would like to be invited to her house . ) Her hand softenedand warmed as I held it . I realized I had no right to hold this hand ; released it , patted it , offered her another cigarette . She said no . I felt she was smiling : at me , with me , maybe . She had put me firmly in my place , long ago , after she had done so much to help me get my bearings . Gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been honest and direct , too ; and I knew she was right ; and she knew it . Mark probably knew about it , too . I guess she told him . But he had never given the slightest indication he knew ; nor shown jealousy  --  how could he be jealous of a oneleggedman ! I almost jammed the car in front of us . I felt her stiffen but she said nothing . Snap out of it , I told myself , you 'll kill both of you . We were passing through a small town . Stopped at a crossing while a freight train crept by . A street light was overhead : Ip183could see her face now , the sharp curving line from ear to chin ; her black straight hair ; she had not put on her small hat ; probablywould forget to until Boston reminded her . She seemed so valiant , somehow , sitting there quietly , her worries pushed back from my view . I was swept by feeling . I buried it quick ; word and feeling . I turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heard myself say to him , " Cold morning . " He said , " Shore is . I said to her in a low voice , " Seems old to he doing this kind of thing . " She looked at him , said it would be interesting to try a lithographof his face . There 's something cruel in it , and harsh , she said . " They 're such different feelings . " IIe 'd been beat and he 'd beat back . And she liked that . But the cruelty was deeper : she felt it was reserved for those he loved , maybe ; and yet he 's warm and sentimental . " You feel his eyes would fill up quickly if you mentioned the two or three right things . I am not sure I 'm a painter . I care too much for the psychology of a face . You feel his face could slide off in pieces . They 're just barely overlapped now . " The traffic bars were open . I was driving across tracks as she said this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . I thought , as I drove down the one business street of the town , that a bank is a lonely thing at four-fifteen in the morning . One light on . No tellers . Vaults closed . No customers . Just dead money : pieces of metal ; stacks of paper ; still and meaningless until a human eye looks , a hand reaches , then they take on life , they become more alive than people , sometimes . Next to the bank , a grocery store . New modern front . One light on . Dark , except near the wide show-window which was full of rusty country hams . Next door , a hardware store . New modern front . One light on . They 'd left two plows outside . Forgot them , I guess . A cat was lying on one of them . Looked like All Baba . I thought , Suppose all this were buried ; and a thousand years from now somebody excavated it and began to study the artifacts to see what kind ofp184culture this town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful , what ugly hard truths they had had the fortitudeto hold on to , what they had created with their hands , what kind of God they had worshippedShe was answering me . I had almost forgot what I had said . " Yes , " she was saying , " but some faces show it ; others do n't . " Face . . . oh yes , the watchman at the crossing . As I remember his face today , I see nothing but an old dark cap with the earflaps pulled down , yellow bushy eyebrows , a mole near his mouth , and the jaws working as he chewed tobacco . I wonder if she still remembers him . I thought , She has herself completely under control . She 'll be all right with the boy . Easy , calm . She is worried all right but she 'll never show it . They 're both lucky to have her . " Dave  --  " It must have been twenty minutes later , " when you were Andy 's age , how did you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added softly . I did n't know what to say . " Your father  --  did you feel close to him ? " " No . " " Do you know why ? " " No . I never did , somehow . " " You respected him ? " " I think so . In the home  --  I 'm not sure . It was different when I went to his office . " " Do you mind telling me how it was different ? " I did n't quite know . These things are not easy to say . I think I liked the walls lined with his lawbooks , most of them a dull yellow and brown  --  I remember I liked that ; Dad sitting at his desk studying important-looking papers ; the clerks taking books down and looking up precedents as they prepared briefs , everybodytalking legal jargon . It was impressive . When he 'd lean back in his old swivel chair , swing around , put the tips of his fingers together and quote something from Justice Holmes , as he was fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was impressive . But at home , he was n't impressive . " I do n't quite know , " I said . Strange . . . it is gone , then it returns : Meg and I would be eating our breakfast in the small breakfast room . Dishes were white with yellow bands , I remember that . Mother reading the sports page . My father reading the financial page of New York Times . Mother would tell Meg and me every sports event , as if she were our age , and I 'd say Gee . . . golly/ . My father would say nothing . And Meg 's big gray eyes would look at me and look at Mother and look at Dad and then she 'd eat her oatmeal very fast and Mother would say , " Not so fast , Margaret ! " It swings back as if you had pressed a button : enlarged a bit , or diminisheda bit , sometimes with words , sometimes without words , sometimes lighted differently  --  but always there , those feelings  --  pulling loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , " Mother took us to hear him argue a famous murder case . I was twelve . She told us it was an important day in our lives . It was . " There were many people but the ones I watched were the reporters from the city newspapers , and the photographers , outside the court room ; inside , the judge , the men in the jury box , witnesses taking the oath on the Bible , the attorneys . I did n't pay much attention to the man beingtried  --  it was Dad 's role I watched . When he stepped out and began to cross-examine the witnesses I felt a tremendous excitement . He had a quick , fiery , wittily aggressive approach . Like a good net player in a tennis game . " Did he win ? " " Yes . " " Suppose he had n't . " I did n't reply to that . " I remember Mother saying to us , Your father is the most brilliant lawyer in the state . Then she 'd add , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelingthere was something else he did n't have . Something important . It bothered me . " Grace said , " Was there antagonism ? "  | " Not that I remember . We just did n't seem to have anything to say to each other . " I thought about it , a bit more . " He and Meg hit it off fine . I 'm pretty sure he did n't like my playing football , going in for sports , the way I did . He wanted me to read more . " " But you do read . " " Yes . But not then . Not while he was alive . " That is true . I stubbornly refused , while he was alive , to do the things he wanted his son to do . Especially the reading . Now  --  were he to return and see my study lined with books and his old swivel chair , what would he think ? I said , " I know I missed something big . That is why Mark 's relationship with Andy seems  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not so sure . Things hurt more when you care too much . " I did n't agree but I said nothing . I was thinking about the boy : He was about eight when I came to Windsor Hills . Not a husky , but skilled in the use of his body . He spent a good bit of time working on dance routines with his mother , in the basement . Mark did n't like that . I rememberhe said , " Let 's get the boy out in the open . " He was n't upset ; just seemed to feel uncomfortable about Andy dancing . So I taught Andy to box . Gave him a bow and some arrows for Christmas . We rigged up three bales of hay behind the target so we would n't nip our neighbors , and I practiced archery with him . I took him to the pool that summer ; taught him to swim . By the time he was ten , he was the best diver in his age-group in Windsor Hills . An absolutely fearless youngster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . Mind ? subtle , quick . Feelings ? too sensitive maybe ; maybe too much imagination , too much empathy , but a fine sense of humor . Honest and generous . That letter had hurt him , all right ; and would keep hurting ; but it did n't seem to me to have disastrous possibilities . I said , " I suppose you have looked through the electron microscopeat the lab ? at Mark 's nuclei and viruses ? " " Yes . " " An incredible experience , is n't it ? "  | " Yes , of course . " " It would be a nightmare if we had the power to see our humanrelationships as clearly . Even as it is , we may be too sensitive , too aware . With our half-knowledge , we see the human child as frail but he is also tough and durable . Andy can take a lot of hard knocks . " That kind of reassurance does n't help much and I knew it but it was all I could come up with at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now through a village of small houses where mine workers live . Lights were on in some of the houses ; some were still dark . I remembered how I used to lie awake on the train when I was a kid and watch the lights come on in houses . I 'd lean my face against the cold window pane and wait for that first light to pop out of the blackness . The fields would be dark blobs slidingby , higher blobs of hills sliding back of them , then one by one the lights would come on . They held me : I 'd always wake up for this dark hour when it is day for so many people you never know . You look at it when you 're a little tyke and think one thing : think another when you are older . When I was small it 'd be how things smelled : in yard , barn , house : how they sounded : I 'd wonder if milkers listened to the ping-pang of milk squirting into empty pails or were they too cold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a worker left with his lunch pail , I 'd make up a lunch for him to take along : peanut butter sandwich , cake , the things a ten-year-old likes . When I was fifteen or sixteen , I thought about Them , the Two of them : as they ate breakfast before dawn ; did she cook it ? or did he go to work and leave her in bed ? Wondered how she felt as she lay half-asleep against him ; was she soft and warm ? smell good ? did he kiss her ? did they laugh ? did he touch her the way I would so she 'd remember all day while I worked ? or did he just get up and leave , and go to the mine or the factory ? And then , when I was much older , I 'd wake up pushed by the old sense of wonder but my brain would now feel compelledp188to ask chill questions about farm prices , wages , unions , housing  --  And lle and She , and the cow , the ping-pang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live creatures feeding , the man with the lunch-box taking a kid 's lunch along with him , turned into " economic conditions , social conditions , farm conditions , " which I , a clergyman , must try to understand . But I 'd never understand the real things . . . no woman would give me  --  she could n't , I guess , forget the leg  --  if she could forget I know I. .. . I sighed ; covered it with a low laugh . Grace said , " Something funny ? " I said , " No ; guess not . " We had left the town and were in the hills . Two freight trucks were in front of us and close to each other . I was timing the moment to pass when she said , " Dave . . . you do n't think he  --  did anything ? do you ? " I was passing , a car was nosing around the curve , I cut in quick behind the front truck , the rear one gave way , the approaching car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passed the other truck , got in the clear , speeded up . " And you do n't , either . " No answer . " You ca n't , possibly . " I was surprised that she had put it in words . Shaken . How could she ? We must have gone five miles . Ten , maybe . " Even if  --  " Voice almost a whisper . " I 'd understand that he was sick  --  something had given way  --  it can happen to any  --  " I cut her sentence off . I was startled by the anger in myp189voice . " He 's no more sick than I am . Or you . Not as sick as I am , probably . " Silence . " We 've got to believe in him . Not just understand  --  believe in him . A man 's got to have  --  " Wagon rose up out of the fog . I put on brakes , eased over on the shoulder to use up speed , crept along behind it . There was something in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then . Animal ? Was n't sure . It bothered me . Box ? I was dangerously close to that wagon , could n't pull away from it , car lights back of me . Two animals , maybe ? Piece of machinery  --  why would machinery be moving . . . . If I had been alone 1 might have concentrated on that covered-up slow-squirming lump ; my mind sticks fast , sometimes , on the irrelevant . But I was n't alone  --  and everything in the car was racing and everything outside was moving slow as death . I felt her physical nearness as I had never felt it before . I began to think it in words . Blocked the words off . Said , " You love him ? " " You know I do . " Yes , I knew ; that one thing I was sure of . And it did n't make me feel better  --  " Love is n't enough . " I left it there for half a mile . " Not nearly enough . " Then I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to think you cared and were standing by but had lost your faith in him . " Whom are you preaching at ? her ? yourself ? " Look : everything was all right until last night . Nobody could have done better ; you were sure of him , he knew you were and it steadied him . You knew Susie 's story was made up . Somebodymade it up  --  if she did n't . You told me you understood how little girls or their mothers , or both , imagine these things and then project them  --  You told me you had heard of a similar case . In Maryland , I think you said . " " But  --  " " But last night , everything fell on you : that letter to Andy ; then Mark telling you he was in the store when he had said for weeks he was n't ; then , like a crazy idiot I dragged in the Dos/toevsky business . I want you to forget that book . It has nothing to do with Mark . Nothing ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have  --  " " How ? " She did n't answer . " How ? " She said , " I knew a girl at school ; she was at a house party  --  somehow they got to talking about ways of committing suicide . The next day she killed herself . It has happened many times . " " I Lave you ever engaged in a discussion of suicide ? " " Yes . " " You did n't kill yourself , next day . " " But the talk oppressed me . I kept thinking about it . " I tried again . This time , I was glad to hear my voice coming through more relaxed and sympathetic . " You and Mark were talking about Virginia Woolf 's problems as a translator , were you not ? How she handled her material , the imagery , speech rhythms and so on ? " " Yes . " " You were not , actually , talking about the subject matter , were you ? the seduction ? " " No . But he knew the story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know  --  maybe an impulse  --  " " Not possible . I 'm sorry to keep interrupting you but it could n't possibly  --  not in Mark . He would n't have had such an impulse , to be released . " " But you thought it , did n't you ? last night ? " I had eased too close to the wagon . Tried to get some distancebetween us . " You did think it , Dave ? " " I thought about it  --  or it flashed through my mind . I do n't believe it . " " Why did n't he tell me he was there ? All these weeks ... . I ca n't understand it " ' Yes . This is what is bothering her . But there was no sense tangling with it . To find out we 'd have to follow every footprint Mark had made since he was born , maybe . I said , " He didn'tp191want to worry you . The fact that he was in that store put him in a shaky position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knew it was hard enough on you as it was . Look : Let 's do n't ask the whys we ca n't answer . We 're not talking about a theoreticalman , we 're talking about Mark . We both know he finds it almost impossible to talk about things that go deep with him . Let 's leave it at that . The important thing is Mark 's valuesmorals  --  controls : Are they skin-deep ? " She sighed softly . It got me . I thought , I 'm asking too much when she'sShe said , " No . " I pushed on . " Suppose one of his assistants in the lab were found dead  --  say , in the tissue room  --  and Mark was the only person you knew who had been there ; but he had been there : would you think he had killed him ? " " Of course not . " " Are you sure ? " " Yes . " " But you can suspect him of seducing a child ? or trying to ? " She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become unendurable . I felt compelled to break it . I said , " Does he love you ? " " Yes . " " Would you know ? " " Yes . I 'd know . " Her voice shook me . It was so confident . " All right . Then why would he want  --  why would he even think about a silly little girl ? What in him would need this experience ? What is the hunger he must satisfy ? " She said , " Have n't you thought about it ? do n't all men ? sometimes ? half-think ? half-want ? wonder ? Not on top of the mind but deepdown . I 've thought horrible things , savage things . I 've wondered how it would feel to do them , too . You have n't ? are you so pure  --  or just simple ? " I laughed . She laughed , too . It eased us for a moment . " Sure I have . But you have n't done them  --  and he has n't either . " My voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cassock to protect you  --   |p192She  did n't answer , at once . Then she said in a lighter tone  --  it surprised me : " You remember Millie ? "  --  Hie girl who shared your apartment in New York ? " " Yes . Millie used to think  --  She 'd be walking along the street and see herself , suddenly , plunge a knife in a passer-by . She 'd sec the knife , in her mind . See it sink in . But she could never see her own hand or the face of the person . Now and then , she 'd look out the window and think , Suppose I dropped a flowerpoton that old woman 's head , down there . " " But she did n't . " " No . " Why on earth had she said this ! She was still on Millie . She said Millie would tell her :  --  If I ca n't shake it off , I 'll have to go to a psychiatrist . And that costs money . And he 'd tell me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values or make me remember the nasty things I used to think and do as a kid , all of which I remember anyway.  --  How do you know he would , Millie ?  --  Oh , you hear things . You just know . I 'll stick to Millie 's method . Millie 's method was this : when she thought about that knife she 'd try to carry the feeling , tension , over into her acting : sharpening movements , voice . It seemed to work . Her acting improved and the knife disappeared . She called it her variant on Stanislayski . It 's a triple deal , she 'd say : her method . She got rid of the thought , improved her acting , and kept Joe . " Who 's Joe ? " " I was never quite sure . She met him at a Communist cocktailparty . " " How is she now ? " " Fine . Six children . She 's good with them , too . " " Never plunged that knife ? " " Not yet . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's children ? " " No . She married a junior executive in her father 's mills . Her father retires next year and her husband will then becomepresident of the mills . "  |p193A  hundred yards on , I laughed . She laughed . The wagon . Too much fog to pass . We were moving at less than ten miles an hour . The drag made me tense ; and her words were exacerbating . Why Millie ? Why on earth must we talk about Millie ? We had laughed about her , all right ; but we had not relaxed , and what was the point of it ? I thought , I 'll switch to politics if I can . Thought , No ; you 'd better not slip away from it . I said , " Of course it shook you . What he told us , last night . " No reply . " But being shaken up and losing your confidence in him are two different things . If we ca n't feel the absolute truth of what he said , how he felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . his loneliness as a child . . . the sailboat . . . the cement mixer  --  if we ca n't see the truth of it there 's something wrong with us , not with him . I never believed you 'd  --  " I left it there . There was no sound . I was afraid she was crying . I could not be sure . Since we got in the car , all the way , I had been tense , irritable . Actually fighting her . And I knew it . I was amazed at myself . Why was I behaving like this ? She 'd been through weeks of it . Had geared her organism to accept what had happened as an insane accident ; now  --  it was transformed by his admission , last night , into something quite different . He had been there . The child had beat on him . The two had experienced , together , an intimate and ancient terror . Then  --  Well , they were different afterward . Both of them . And somehow he had felt incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd had no sleep , no solitude . She 'd been fed some pretty raw facts during the last twelve hours . And here I was , demanding the correct answer from her . What did I think she was ? an IBM brain ? Her voice was quiet and under complete control when she finally spoke . " Dave , you love him and respect him , as he does you . And you feel it is wrong for you and me to talk about him . You think we should just stand by him without admitting what is in our minds . " Of course I felt that way . Felt it intensely . " But that is a conventional attitude . It is not necessarily right for him or Andy  --  or me. "  |p194I  did not try to answer that , either . " I do n't know what you think belief in a person is . But whatever it is , it is not certainty that he wo n't make mistakes . Or sin . " As she talked , my feelings rather than my reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin ? a man is not capable of all sins ! " Or become sick and do  --  There may be pressures on Mark I know nothing about . Something may have caused a psychic upheavalin him  --  you know he would n't show it , it could be happening and he would go along as quietly as ever . Calm , composed  --  youknow him this well , Dave ! He 's worked much too hard , lately ; I 've realized that . " " He loves his work . " I meant it . But think of spending your life concentrating on a speck so small that you can see it only through an electron microscope ! Those viruses . Looking at them  --  analyzing what he sees , measuring , comparing , measuring , watching minute changes , minute transformations  --  Maybe she 's right . Maybe the rest of him ca n't put up with it , maybe somethingrevoltedShe was answering me , " I know he loves it . It is his life . But those memories last night  --  they forced him to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had as a child . Suppose  --  I think you can be too scientific . I do n't know how to say it because I 'm muddled about it but suppose it , the other part of him , the memories , feelings pushed him too hard and he did somethingirrational  --  something completely uncharacteristic of him  --  I do n't think this has happened but I do n't know ! What I know is , I love him  --  regardless of what may or may not have happened inside him . Because I do , I want to consider every possibility  --  not to judge him but to know what to do next ! " Is there something else ? are things not right between them  --  has he stopped  --  I would n't finish it . Then , " Could you forget you are Mark 's loyal friend and be my priest for a little while ? Let me say what is so hard to say ? " I felt irony in that voice , as if she had read my thoughts ; and under it , desperation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was dead serious . " I need to say it , Dave . "  |p195I  apologized and told her I wanted her to say anything that would help her . And then I passed that wagon . She seemed to have forgot we were talking . I said , " You want to tell me something ? " " Yes . " She stopped . Began again . " You remember I told you , once , what happened to me when I was not much older than Andy ? " I remembered but I did n't say anything . " I keep thinking if only I could  --  " She did n't say more . I drove on for another mile or two . She said , " Dave  --  I ca n't tell Andy that Mark was in the store . " " Why should you ? " " Mark says I must . " " Why ? " " I 'm not sure . I told him I did n't think it was necessary , it would be better not to . This seemed to upset him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked me why I felt Andy should n't know . I tried to remind him that it might be hard on the boy  --  children feel things deeply because they 've had so little experience and ca n't find a name for what they are feeling . Then he looked at me in a queer way , a bitter , sharp way , and said he was n't sure of me . Not sure at all , he said . " " Meaning ? " " I do n't quite know . " " Was he drinking ? " " The one drink in your study . I do n't think he drank anything when he came home . He said he felt something change in me when he told me he was in the store . He said it two or three times , You changed when I told you . I told him I was surprised , of course ; I was so sure he had n't been near the place . But I made it worse . He said , All right : I lied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the phone . Then he said he was not going to lie again or let us lie . He kept saying over and over , The boy has to hear the truth ; we can not lie to him again . He said Andyp196would believe him because he had always told him the truth . " And you think ? " " Ewer since Andy was born we 've tried to be as honest as we could with him . Both of us . Ever since he was a baby . But there conies a time  --  How can you reveal everything about your life to a child ? why should you ? why subject him to such an ordeal ? why does Mark want this ? " " 1 do n't know . " I know a combination of shocks can work like a powerful drug on a man causing him to have unpredictable reactions  --  butI could scarcely believe this . And this doubt she was feeling  --  this was hard to believe , too . Had she thought it up duringour ride ? did she feel this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , the boy will feel it , too . I finally said , " Suppose you do what he wants : tell Andy everything that happened . Can you explain it as a kind of **27;591;TOOLONG ? Here is his father : in the store looking around , as anyone might do . Then in comes this Susan . But he does n't hear her . He is sitting on a pile of lumber remembering things and thinking ; and the kid does n't see him . Then he goes to the latrine  --  and she sees him and the rest of it happens . Then everybody accuses him of something he did n't do  --  just because he is tall and the crazy kid said the man in the store was tall . Would he believe you ? " " Every word I 'd say  --  if that were all . But he has the letter : he knows other people know . And he knows we kept it from him . He 's thinking about it in those terms , and in other terms too . His imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing in his mind  --  what pictures are there  --  He must have thought things  --  all children do  --  about us , about me , maybe ; about Mark , tabooedthings  --  An anonymous letter  --  it is curious , Dave , but it is as if it were coming out of you , your own self . The ones they pushed under my door frightened me . " " Of course they did . They were obscene and insulting . " " It was more than that . You feel , something in you feels , that they came from an unknown place ; and this brings up associations : hell , caves , labyrinths , mysterious powers , oracles , demons  --  I lay awake last night thinking what it would do to Andy  --   |p197Your  grown-up mind sees it simply as a misspelled , stupid , nasty anonymous letter  --  but something on a wordless , primitive level in you reacts . I  --  I do n't know how far it has pulled him . " For the first time , she was crying . She fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " If this had happened to you , even if I told him you were in the store , I should have no difficulty convincinghim of your innocence . It would be almost as if I were reading a suspense story to him and by a strange twist of circumstancehe knew the accused . He 'd say , But of course Father Dave did n't do it  --  he just happened to walk in that store and look around . But when it is your own father , it is different . He ca n't help but think  --  " " What everybody else is thinking  --  only more so . " " Yes . The details Mark told us will make it worse . " " Omit the details . " " I see no reason to mention the store . That letter has done enough . " I thought , She 's working on it too hard . Pulling it this way , that ; probing too much . He 'll feel her feelings . If she is sure of Mark and calm , he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " When you 're young , you think things you ca n't possiblysay . You 're defenseless . You 've nothing to measure your thoughts or feelings by . No frame to put around them . I keep thinking what happened to me , Dave . " " What do you want to do ? " " I want to tell him only what Mark told you and me , in the beginning . I want to say we were planting the tulips on the terrace . The tall black ones I wrote him about . That we had worked a long time ; it was a warmish day and his father said , Let 's give ourselves a break and have a rum and Coke . So we went inside and I discovered there were no Cokes . So : Mark went to Matthews and got a carton , came back , and we had our drinks . In the meantime , this child  --  this Susan Newell  --  went in the vacant store and something scared her . She said a tall thin man did something bad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , and said he was the man . " " He is going to ask why . "  | " I 'll tell him she thought it because he is tall and thin . And other pet plc happened to see him at Matthews  --  " I said , " I ) es Andy know where that vacant store is ? How near it is to Matthews ? " " I 'd think so . " In a moment she said , " Yes . He asked me  --  I remember now  --  it was a year or two ago : he asked me why the store was closed . I told him Toni had gone away and no one seemed to know who owned the store ; there was an uncertainty about Toni 's death , too ; no one had proof that he had died and no one knew who his heirs were . I remember now : Andy persisted in his questions . Had I ever been inside ? I told him no . Had anyone been inside ? I told him I did n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it empty ? or were things still in there ? I explained that the store was closed when we came to Windsor Hills and I had never heard anyone discuss it . He ran to the window and tried to look in . The glass was covered with that white soapy stuff . He came running back  --  I was parked in front of Town and Country  --  and he told me he had seen a yellow cat asleep in the window . He was extremely excited , wanted to know how a cat could be in a store that had been shut up for years . He wanted to go to the alley to see if a window had been left open or if the back door had a small hole in it through which the cat could come and go . " I said , " If I were you , I 'd tell him nothing or I 'd tell him everything . Why tell him about the Cokes ? Just tell him the whole thing was made up . That Mark was with you all afternoon . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . Say you planted bulbs , the two of you ; then you sat on the front terrace and read . Tell him Susan went in the store , all right , and was scratched by the old yellow cat he had seen long ago and it scared her ; then she ran into the beauty shop and told them a man was in the store prowling around ; then everybody began to talk and make up things . She said the man was tall and thin and Mark happens to be tall and thin ; so does her father ; and that is that . Tell him Susan is a liar . And her mother is a worse one . Tell him I saw Mark on the terrace at five-thirty at the exact momentSusan was inside the store . "  |p199She  began to laugh . It was hysterical laughter , close to tears . I tried to stop her , then I began to laugh too . Finally she said , " We may all be absolutely wacky . " Then she said , " Mark is never unreasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . I feel it is important for me to find it . " " It is possible he is tired . When you are your judgment is likely to be poor . " She was still working at it : " Andy is more than a son to Mark , " she finally said . " He 's everything Mark missed as a child : home , mother , father . . . he 's all of it . Mark talked all night about it . I le thinks he will be telling Andy the truth when he tells him the literal facts . Mark said to us  --  did n't he ? last night ? that facts do not necessarily add up to the truth . There are facts and facts  --  and they do n't all speak a modern language  --  am I wrong ?  --  did n't he say it ? If not last night , he has said it another time . Some facts by-pass the reason and go to the primitive part of us . I 'm sure he has said it to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then why is he insisting that I load Andy with facts that are bound to add up to a big lie  --  And one the child ca n't take ? " " I do n't know . " She said slowly , " I suppose no one ever had an emptier childhood  --  That lonely little fellow he told us about last night , playingclown , with the pine curls stuck under his cap  --  and his father 's suspicious , blazing anger . He had never told me this , untillast night . " " Yes , but I think we can overstress these things . " " I know , Dave . I know there is not just one reason , or just two or three or four . But his father did n't trust him long ago when he needed trust . Now his son must give him that trust : must prove himself the all-understanding person his father failed to be . " " Does this seem like Mark to you ? " " Not in the least . But none of it seems like him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought about it in the store ;  |p200and  he thought about it again , last night , because he told it to us . " And you think all the commotion has brought the memory wide awake , the hurt or need , and now it wants to be fed , or something ? " in a way ; in a devious way , yes . " Neel and I had trapped ourselves with theories about Susan . And we were dead wrong when we had been sure we were right . This might or might not be right . You know the theory : you try to fit your unique experience , or somebody else 's , to it : you pinch it off here , pull it around there  --  but it tricks you because there is usually one detail that is different and one detail , or two or three , can wreck any theory . I said , " It is possible . Mark 's under terrific pressure . He may want something of himself or Andy or their relationship that he has n't needed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me about the most sensible , rational person I ever knew . I just do n't know . " " I do n't know , either . Because he 's always seemed that way to me , too . But last night , after we left you , he seemed different . He could n't stop talking . He walked up and down the living room , talking , talking . He told me about those years in prison  --  he 'd never talked about it before . The loneliness . He described everything in precise detail as if it were necessary for me to see it , too . The nights . . . the days . . . the nights . . . how he wanted me ; then he stopped wanting me ; he decided he could n't have me ever again so he stopped wanting me ; he just wanted a woman , any woman . . . then he wanted anybody , any live humanbeing . It was then , he said , the terror began : when the lonelinesshardened into concrete wants . He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of being cut off from all you need and feed on , all your mind , body , heart need  --  then suddenly it becomes an object , a thing threatening you , and you must not let it touch you , you must fight it off with other objects ... . He described how he fought it ; how he piled up all he knew to keep the loneliness from touching him . He said he did n't havep201many personal memories to pile up ; he tried to go back to his childhood but he could n't remember much ; then he tried to go back to his years in Ohio but he could n't remember them ; so he piled up facts , all the facts he knew about biology and chemistry . He 'd put his mind on the bloodstream , and think about it day and night : It became as big as the Mississippi River as he filled it with the facts he had learned about it . He 'd say , Tonight I shall think about plasma ; another night he 'd think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enzymes ; or he 'd think about sugar levels , let them rise and fall in this great Bloodstream that flowed across his mind . Then he 'd think about tissue : healthy tissue , malignant tissue ; then the endocrine system , the hormones ; he 'd try to break them into molecules , and then he 'd try to break the molecules . Sometimes he 'd begin with the cells : he 'd say , There are two hundred billion cells in a baby 's body and he 'd go on from there , differentiating them ; or he would beginwith one cell : he 'd break that cell down into its constituent parts until he 'd get to the nucleus , then he 'd try to break the nucleusinto its acids . . . . He tried to remember poetry but he could n't remember much and this bothered him . But he could rememberfacts . One night , he bounded the states of the Union , telling himself that Arkansas was bounded by Mississippi and Tennessee on the east , Texas and Louisiana on the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , then he bounded Missouriand from Missouri he moved on to Ohio , and on until he had bounded every state in the Union . Then he named the Presidentsof the United States . He tried to do the Secretaries of State but broke down around Cleveland or McKinley . One night he began to make colors in his mind : He remembered watching Grace paint , so he took the idea of gray and mixed the colors in his mind until , a week later , he had sixty-four shades of gray . He felt much better , afterward . Then he remembered a little play he had been in . In the third grade in Quitman , Georgia , or Madison , Florida ; he spent almost all of one night trying to decide which state he was in when he was in the little play . With that settled , he remembered the crude paper flowers they had made ; the teacher had brought rolls of colored tissue paper to school , it swishedp202when she unrolled it and the sunlight caught the colors and the paper unrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his stomach . Ile thinks it was his first esthetic experience . He said the colors slid something tremendous to him . So in that dark prison , he tried to make those bright-colored paper flowers again , in his mind ; then he began to think of flowers in botanical terms and constructed petals and stamen and sepals and pistils and all the rest of it . And , about then , he remembered Goethe 's symbolic plant . He had always considered The Metamorphosis of Plants a kind of scientific-literary curiosity . But shut away from the world , he found he liked to think about it . It turned into poetry , the poetryof morphology . Then he remembered Heimholtz 's argumentsagainst that book . He tried to follow the argument through but he 'd lose it and return to his facts . There seemed to be plenty of facts in his mind . So he piled them , like bricks , around him . Then the nightmare began : the bricks liquefied , the facts melted like syrup candy and ran off the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loneliness . She said , " Once he spent a week , maybe a month  --  he said he had no idea of time  --  remembering every place in New York we had been together : what time of day or night we went there , how long we stayed , what we did , how we got there , whether we went by cab or subway or walked , what we ate , then he 'd try to remember what clothes I had on . And sometimes he could rememberbut always , after a time , I seemed to have on nothing . He said he distinctly remembered , as he lay there in that prison , an afternoon at the Museum of Modern Art : We were looking at an exhibit of French Impressionists : he remembered we were looking at a Renoir , and I walked over to two Seurats , and he noticed as I stood there , that I had on a blue tweed skirt and a black jacket . And then the clothes were not there . I was naked . And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just a body : then I turned into a Picasso-like cubist construction broken into quite interesting planes and tensions , he said ; then that faded , too . And there was nothing . This was when he began to want something : anything , if only it were living and breathing . And finally he knew he was close to losing his reason , he feltp203it sliding away . And there followed a black empty time when he was fighting fighting . . . . Then , finally , he began to clear . The first thing he remembered was that he had a little son named Andrew whom he had never seen . It began , he said , as a kind of depersonalized idea ; a clean abstraction . Then , he slowly realized he did actually have a son whom lie had never seen  --  a flesh and blood son who breathed and cried and laughed and might even now be saying two or three words . IIe held on to this  --  as a persondrowning might do . And slowly he believed it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see him growing from day to day . His imagination was living again ; every day , he created this son anew and watched his creation grow and change , grow and change . And this held him ; this staved off time Enemy . It was not me ; it was Andy whom he had never seen who saved him . " I understand , " she said . " I almost understand . And I am glad he felt he could say it . " Voice low  --  and trembling now and then ; but otherwise she was holding herself steady . " It was just so much , coming at one time . Something in his mind opened in your study : once opened , it would n't shut . Everything poured out . His friendship for you : did you know he cared so much ? " I did n't know . " His research  --  you realize what that means to him ? " " I think so . " " Did you know his mother died of cancer when he was a year old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either . Until last night . I knew she died when he was a baby . That is all he had told me . I keep thinking about it . " After another silence she said , " Once , he fell out of a tree and landed on his head . " She tried to laugh . " He told me about that , too ; everything , the big the little ; he told me everything . So much . It is like a flood . It drowns me , sort of . His research , the feeling he has about it  --  is it because of the way his mother died ? he never knew her  --  but is he now determined to know the enemywho killed her ? is that part of it ? for him ? " " Not necessarily . " I wished she had n't said it . Why try to findp204the primal cause of everything ! A man 's choice of work  --  surely there must be a hundred reasons why it chooses him or he chooses it . " Mark 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of curiosity and at home with abstractions . You know that . He is by temperament and tin quality of his mind , a natural researcher . Let 's leave it at that . " " Yes , I know . It 's just that I felt I understood him so well a few weeks ago . Now he 's turned into a stranger . " " You have n't had time to fit it together . But it does fit ; there 's nothing , is there , that tears up what you had thought about him ? It makes him bigger  --  you are aware of a little more of him but this gives him depth . The old iceberg analogy : only a small part of us thrusts up above the waters . This is true of all of us . You know this as well as I do . " " Dave . . . why did it happen ? I have sworn I would n't ask it . I know how silly it is to ask it . I know it 's primitive  --  But why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't try . Do n't try . " She began again . " Just before we were married , I told him what happened to me at camp , in New England . With a woman . I was nearly fifteen . " It had swung around again . Why on earthI wanted the fog to lift , daylight to come . I looked at the speedometer , wondered if I could push it up a bit ; then , perhaps , she 'd realize we 'd better not talk more , just now . We were in a dip of the road and the fog was thick and wet ; vision blanked out thirty feet ahead . I slowed down , said , " Would you like a cigarette ? " She said yes . I pushed in the lighter . We smoked a while . Neither of us said a word for a long time . We had eased into open space where there was no fog . She said , " When I told him , we were falling in love and I was thinking only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Now I 'm afraid it may have something to do with my whole life . I feel  --  " She was groping , she could n't find it . " In what way ? " " I do n't know . I feel it has caught up with me . " " You think you 're being  --  punished ? "  | " Not in a crude way . But I have the feeling it may be one thing , among others , that could have  --  " Unfinished . I thought , She 's fallen into a stream and is being swept away by a swift cruel undercurrent . It is not characteristic of her  --  this guilt . She 's modern in her point of view , informed , has always been relaxed . I was remembering how easy and natural she had been with Andy when things came up  --  masturbation  --  all the thingsI said , " Something happened to you , once , when you werefifteen years old  --  and now you think Mark has brooded over it ? " " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you ? " " I want you to . " She said softly , " It is dawn . I had n't noticed . " She turned away and looked at the countryside . A meadow was shining with heavy frost , weeds and dead goldenrod arid sumac were stiff and white with it , and fog was rising now from the pavement , spillingover the shoulders of the road . She did not turn back until we had left the meadow behind us . Then she gave me a quick imploringlook and began to talk  --  I think she intended to begin with the woman . But instead , she began with Mark : telling me of their first weeks together , long ago , in New York : They were in her walk-up apartment . But first : They had met three weeks before . One cold rainy night in 1942 . In front of the Royale Theater . He was a colonel in the Air Force . Had done a stint in England ; was home instructingp206at one of our bases . She was studying modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both maybe ; was studying sculpturewith Zorach . On that rainy night , they were two strangers standing near the curb . She glanced at him , thought he looked interesting . She said she must have looked like a drowned rat . Everybody wanted cabs , of course . He stepped out , signaled , she ran out and signaled too , the cab driver ignored her , said to him , Yes sir ! He opened the door , she called , You meanie ; Mark turned , saw her , laughed , said , Come along , I 'll take you home . It could n't have been a more stereotyped beginning , in wartime . But it was their beginning . " I let him pick me up because I could see he was nice and I was soaking wet . " They went to her apartment , she asked him in and they talked all night . Her roommate , Millie , came in , went to bed ; but they talked on and on . He told her about his research in biochemistry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me : who flunked in chemistry ; only thing I ever failed in . " She told him about modern dance , what it meant to her , and he listened as if he cared ; she told him about abstract expressionism , and he asked her to show him some paintings in the galleries . Tomorrow , he said . He built a fire in the small grate ; she cooked bacon and eggs in the small kitchen ; they drank wine , they drank coffee , they talked until dawn . She said , Tell me about flying . He said , Let 's walk across Brooklyn Bridge . They did . They ate more baconand eggs somewhere on Fulton Street , and then went up on the roof of the old Hotel Margaret to look across the harbor at the Manhattan skyline . IIe came back at noon for her and took her to luncheon at the Plaza because she and her mother had always stayed there on their trips to New York . That afternoon , he took her to Sloan-Kettering , the great research institute where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to make love to me : showing me mice and malignant tissue and tubes and slides , explaining technics , and introducing me to his fellow-researchers . I told them my father was a surgeon ; one of the doctors had heard of him while studying at Hopkins . That made me feel good . I felt I belonged . " They went somewhere for dinner . Then to the Blue Angel.  |p207Then  on to a place in the Village and danced for hours . Next time he was off duty , they took a Seventh Avenue subway to Fulton Street , Manhattan side , and walked over to the fish market . Awful smells , fine sky , gulls greedy , clamorous . They went upstairs to Sweets for lunch . There was a big fat cat under their table . The old waiter shushed it toward the kitchen as he firmly told them to order the small scallops . They obeyed and were glad  --  but they would have liked anything , that day . They wanderedaround old narrow streets clown at the foot of the island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HudsonRiver side and went to Washington Market . Wandered up and down the stalls . " We 'd stand for minutes looking at geese and ducks and pheasants . We 'd examine a thick sirloin steak , cherry red with creamy islands of fat ; then gravely estimate how many people could be served from a certain rib roast . " Detail , detail , detail . I had never heard her remembering aloud before . It had meaning for her , their afternoon in the Market , and it was necessary to pull every stall and its contents back in order to recapture the experience she was seeking  --  She had finished with the cheeses and was now at the vegetable stalls : " We looked a long time at eggplant and purple cabbage and I knew he loved me and I said I 'd never seen anything so beautiful . " Then she told him she loved the name escarolle but hated the thing it stood for ; they talked about names ; he liked water cress best of all  --  its taste and its name . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They went to the fish stalls : looked at clumps of oysters in the shell , and mussels and turtles and piles of gray raw shrimp and bowls of pink cooked ones . She said she liked sea turtle ; and he said he liked the small terrapin or whatever they are you get on the Amazon ; he told her how they mince the terrapin meat down there and season it with all kinds of peppers until it is blazing hot and then stir in farinha and bake the mixture in small shells . She asked when he had been on the Amazon ; he said he had n't , he had read about it in the National Geographic , or somewhere . This made her laugh hysterically . As I listened , her voice was young again , expectant  --   |p208Her  memory had arrived at a flower stall : he bought her a bunch of winter violets and stuck them in her coat . He said , It 's time to buy supper . So they bought mushrooms and caviar , and cheeses whose names they liked , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and French bread . Then he bought a dozen big double-yolked eggs . He spotted them among pyramids of eggs , picked one up , turned it on his palm . He said , " I want a dozen . " The hearty red-cheeked woman behind the stall said , " They 're double . " He smiled , he said , " Yes , I know . " He asked her where she lived ; she told him on a farm on Staten Island ; he told her about his grandfather 's farm in Ohio . And Grace listened and watched his face , his hands . " . . . how gently he picked up that egg  --  as if he had just slipped it out from under the hen . " He hailed a cab . They took the things home . He unwrapped them , he folded the big paper bags , he said where do you keep the bags ? She said she had never kept one . He said they might be useful . So she found a place to keep them . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his lab . " He said he 'd do the snails if she would do the pheasant . While it roasted in the wine , he made a fire in the grate and poured drinks . She set the table . They listened to a Poulenc record . He had never heard Poulenc ; but he remembered that she had mentioned Poulenc when she was talking about her mother playing the piano ; so he asked to hear Poulenc . " He 's always been like that ; always wants to hear , to see . " After the snails and pheasant and the rest of it , they washed dishes . Then he said , for the first time , I love you ; she said yes , she knew ; and she loved him , too . He handed her a fresh dishcloth . When the dishes were done he said , Let 's clean up the place . He poured two glasses of brandy and got the mop and broom . " Millie and I were n't very good housekeepers . " A homesick boy without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much home and now they were playing house together down in the Village . " It was an odd way to make love but it was fun . " When he had things as neat as he wanted them , they drank more brandy and listened to Gershwin because he knew allp209about Gershwin 's music . Then , toward midnight , Millie came . Millie had a small part in a Broadway play ; usually she cleaned up before she left the theater but that night she had n't . She looked tired behind the make-up , and worried , but she stayed with them ; she would go in the bedroom , then come out ; she 'd go to the kitchen , pick up a piece of bread and a bit of pheasant , and come out and sit on the stool and nibble . She seemed to be feeling what they felt . She said , " Let me stay . " They laughed and she stayed , hunched up on the stool , chin in her hands , watching them . " I remember how sorry I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked for another hour . Then he kissed Grace good night , and Millie laughed at them ; then she asked him , like a little girl , to kiss her too . And he did . he ping-pongcd a few words with her ; kissed Grace again , and left . They both listened to him go down the stairs . Millie said , " You get him if you can . " She walked around the room ; she sat down , took off her flats , rubbed her feet ; walked around the room some more ; took a print off its hook  --  it was Picasso 's Two Sisters ; she said , They 're too sad , they have no bones , they 're melting ; she turned it to the wall . She always turned a picture to the wall when she was upset . Sometimes , all the pictures were turned to the wall . " The only fuss we ever had was when she turned my one Klee water color toward the wall . I would n't put up with that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What do you mean ? " " He 's real . You do n't find somebody who 's real  --  not once in ten years . Maybe not ever . You hold on to him . " " You love Joe . " " I know ; but he 's not real . I love phonies because I 'm not real , either . " Grace told her she looked worried . She said she was . She said , " Joe 's sold out . The CP 's bought him . All of him he knows about or they know about . I 'm through . He 's no better than Daddy . The other side of the coin . They both sell out too easy . Dad fights the commies and the commies fight big businessmen like Dad.  |p210But  they 're all  --  oh I do n't know . I sell out too  --  but I do n't know what buys me . " " ' They do n't either , maybe . " The two girls went to bed . Grace tried to worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with Mark . Now  --  three weeks later  --  Mark and Grace were once more in her flat . They had been to a show , had stopped by Sardi 's . They had ordered some food . He said , " Something 's on your mind . Want to tell me ? " The drinks had come . She drank hers quickly . " I was thinking about things . " He did not ask what , but gave her his close attention , the way he does if he thinks you want to say something you are having difficulty with . They finished their drinks . She said , " I 'm sort of scared . You do n't know me . " " I 'll know you better after we are married . Tomorrow ? " She asked him how much longer before he 'd be sent across . He said he was n't sure . She said , A month ? He said , Maybe ; maybe two months . She told him she meant what she said  --  he might not feel the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you , too . But I 'm not worried . " The food was being served . They ate it . They did n't talk much . She was thinking , You do n't have to tell him now . Next week you can do it . He said as they drank their coffee , " What is it ? " She said , " Nothing much . Let 's go home . " And they had gone to Fourth Street . He was building a fire now  --  and she had gone over to the cupboard for a bottle of wine and glasses . He said , " I meant what I said . I want to marry you as soon as possible . " She said , " You have n't met Mother and Dad . " He laughed . " You mean they need to meet me . " " Both . They 'll like you . " " It 'll be rugged but  --  yes , I know they need to meet me . Let'sp211go tomorrow . The fire wo n't burn . " He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . She brought the bottle over to the low table near the fire . Brought the glasses . He said , " You are trembling . " And then she told him  --  about Her . Blurted it out . She said to me , " I do n't have any idea what I said . I just felt he had to know . " And he stood with the blown-out match in his hand and listened as she told him . His eyes meeting hers every moment . At the hard spot , when she found it almost impossible to say the next words , he took her hand and held it as she talked . He let her say all she wanted to say . Then le said , " Sit clown . " She was so weak she fell on the stool . Then he looked at her a long time ; he was almost smiling . Then he said softly , " It is the saddest little story I ever heard . " That made her cry . He stood beside her , touched her hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifted up her face , wiped it against his sleeve , said , " I want you to drink this . " He put a glass in her hand . He lifted his glass and said , " To the girl I love . " And slowly drank his wine . " While I cried like a baby , Dave . " He went to the bathroom , brought back a box of Kleenex . Almostanybody else would have given her his handkerchief but Mark always did the sensible thing . Then he made her drink the wine . Then he worked on the fire , a little . Then he stood looking at her ; suddenly he grinned , said , " Guess I 'd better tell you what I 've done , too . Come over and sit real close . It 's going to be rough but if you can , I can . Once , when I was about seventeen I went berserk and  --  " She put her hand over his mouth . He kissed it . They laughed . They drank another glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I asked him to make love to me , right then . I did n't know how to ask it , I fumbled with my words , I was terribly shy , but I told him what I wanted . " Mark looked at her so long it scared her . He eased her down on the stool . He walked over to the fireplace . He looked at the fire which had not burned much . He turned around , said quietly ,  |p212evenly  , " When I make love to you it is not going to be a lab experiment . Let 's get that straight . That 's what you want ? not me  --  but to be sure of yourself ? " She was too stunned to answer. ' 7o prove something to yourself . That you 're  --  what ? " She could n't answer . " That you 're normal ? is that it ? I know a little about a normal cell  --  do n't know a thing about a normal person . " She said she did n't know what a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal for him because " Because why ? " Because she 'd hate to  --  ruin everything . " Because ? " " I love you . " He looked at her a long time , then smiled and said , " Sounds interesting  --  but it is n't in my line . When I make love to you , it 'll be because we ca n't help ourselves . " " I feel that way  --  right now . " And as I drove along listening I was feeling I have never been young , like that . Why ? Why ? Mark did n't seem to hear . He finished his cigarette . She watched him . She tried hard to get inside his mind . She felt he was already inside hers and she was frightened at what he was seeing there . He spoke casually about meeting her at Penn Stationnext morning . How about in front of Information ? Yes . About nine-twenty ? Yes . Ile kissed her good night ; did it lightly . It hurt . She heard him go down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . Then he ran up the stairs . She opened the door . He came in , took her in his arms , kissed her , made her kiss him , said , " You do love me ? " She whispered yes . " You 're sure ? " She said she was sure . " Sure enough to spend the rest of your life with me ? " " Yes . " " Then hold it . Do n't think about anything else until tomorrow . " And he was gone . At nine-twenty he met her at Information . He told her she looked wonderful ; he liked her in that shade of blue . She tried to say something easy to him . Could n't think of a word . Just smiled , and swallowed hard.  |p213They  went down to the train . They did n't speak as they walked down the stairs . She saw a brown and white wrapper from a candy bar on the cement floor . She saw two fat legs , two wobbly high heels in front of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling a crying dragging child in a red coat . She looked up and into the eyes of an engineer in his cab as they passed another train . She said his eyes had the same intent look that Mark 's often have ; but they were a different color , she could n't remember what color but they were different ; she 'd never forget that engineer , she said . They walked through two cars before they found seats . He took her coat , he put a small canvas bag at his feet . He said , I have a present or two for you . I got your father a bottle of I ) rambuie , hope he likes it . She said lie did . Iie had a Prokofieff record for her mother , hoped she liked Prokofieff . Grace said she did . Did she have this one ? Grace thought she did n't . Neither said more . But she felt good being quiet . " There 're so many kinds of quiet , " she said to me , " and we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They left the tunnel , passed the Jersey marshes , left Newark , left Elizabeth , had passed that big Squibbs sign , wherever it is . Finally she asked to see her present . He took the small case out of his pocket : she knew : he had shown it to her before but she had asked him to keep it a few days . Her ring . He slipped it on her finger . He said , I 've got something else . This time he seemed unsure . He took out a small white prayer book wrapped in tissue paper . He said it was the only thing of his mother 's he owned . Inside was her name : Nancy Livingstone . With love from Mother and Father  --  on her wedding clay . He said , " She was sick a long time before she died . She marked it up quite a bit . " He opened it , showed her the pencil marks , said softly , " That 's all she left in this world , just a few marks on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left you . Could n't say it . He asked her if she 'd keep it while he was gone . " I read it to pieces , " she said to me now , " the years he was in prison . " Then he showed her two faded pictures of the young Nancyp214and his father . Then snapshots of his grandparents who had reared him on that Ohio farm . Then he said , That 's it , I guess . Mutes the man I married , Dave . I wanted you to know . " But I already knew . She told how it was when they arrived at her home in Roland Park . She had telephoned her mother before she left New York . They took a cab at Pennsylvania Station , went up Charles Street , up the Parkway . Mrs. Ryder was waiting . Quietly cordial ; quietly observant . She led them into the music room . She asked them if they would have some sherry . Grace offered to get it ; her mother said , No ; you 're company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He walked over to the Stieff piano , he picked up a Mozartpiano concerto lying there , turned the pages . He whispered , She does n't look a bit like you ; she 's a little like  --  Billie Burke . She whispered that she 'd never thought of it but she was , kind of . Then her mother came in with the silver tray and a bottle of Dry Sack . Mark poured the sherry . Somehow , in a moment or two , he had her settled in her comfortable chair and was talking easily to her . " I knew they liked each other . " She heard her father 's car in the driveway , ran out to meet him . He kissed her , said Sugar , etc . And she said what a girl always says when her father says , It is pretty quick , you know , etc. , had she thought it through , etc . He came in , shook hands with Mark . Grace poured him a drink of Scotch , knowing he was up to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A muscle in her father 's cheek had moved quickly and relaxed , and she knew  --  " he is so obvious "  --  that Mark was not off to a had start . She said she had never seen so much sun in one room . She went over and stuck her finger in the cage and touched the canary . She looked at the miniature cacti and African violets in the window ; she moved the cacti and rearrangedthe African violets . . . and then she moved them back as they had been . And all the time she was listening as Mark talked music with her mother and medicine with her father . She saw Mark look wistfully at the Scotch ; she winked at him . Andp215he , at once , concentrated gravely on his conversation with her mother about Stravinsky . " Dad was sly as a pickpocket : the way he eased Mark 's credentialsout of him : Cornell , medical degree ; Cornell , Ph.D . in biochemistry : names of teachers ; names of one or two scientistswith whom he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base . She knew her father would fade into his study after lunch and call these people . She hoped Mark would n't guess it . But nothing mattered now . She was high on sherry and love : home seemed a nice place to be , at least for a day ; Mark fitted in ; she knew her parents felt it . After lunch , Mark said he believed he 'd go out in the garden and walk around . She stayed and told her parents about him . Everything she could remember . It was n't much , of course . Then her father went in his study , as she knew he would do . And she and her mother asked Mark if he 'd like to drive around Johns Hopkins University and he said he would . When they came back , her father asked Mark to go to the hospital with him , he had a few calls to make . " It was like an old dance everybody in the world knows the steps of . " They took the ten-fifteen back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millie had left a note pinned on an orange in the middle of the coffee table . It said she was spending the night with Joe . " Joe 's overpersuaded me . Pray for my soul . " When Grace read it , her heart began to beat fast . She handed it to Mark . He laughed . " Good old Millie . " She said she 'd make some coffee if he would build a fire . As she went back and forth , she told him how the Committee had been putting pressure on Joe not to marry Millie . She 's bourgeois and stupid , they told him . Joe 's in to his neck , Grace told Mark . She wished Millie would drop him . Millie joined the CP because she hates her family 's hypocrisy : they 're big church people but it is money money things things ; they 're anti-Semitic , anti-Negro , anti-labor , antiTVA , anti-modern art . Everything they fear or do n't understandthey call " communistic "  --  so Millie joined the Communist party , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only playing around . "  | " The CP does n't play dolls , " Mark said . " Sloe knows . But to her anything 's better than her parents ' values  --  theones they say they have . But nobody 's going to boss Millie . Not Joe  --  not the CP  --  not even Millie , I 'm afraid . " They forgot Millie . Mark came over , kissed her , said quietly , " I would like to stay tonight . " She said , " Sure it 's not a lab experiment ? " IIe said , " Sure . " They had an early breakfast , next morning . He went back to the base . Three days later they were married  --  attended by her father and mother and a fellow-officer . " We had five weeks together before he was sent to India . I knew I was pregnant when he left . Somehow I felt this would bring him back . " She was talking to herself , not to me . Searching for the unique something that made it only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice was full of tears as she said , " I tell it , and it could be anybody 's love affair . I thought we went through somethingspecial and rigorous and came out of it stronger , more alive . But now it sounds only very young . " After a little , she said , " I meant to tell you something else , that has to do with that old relationship of mine . I feel  --  I do n't know quite what I feel . " She did not say more . " I remember you told me of the woman 's death . Do you know why it happened ? " " I can only guess . I know a little , yes . It happened seven years after I had known her at camp . " " How old was she ? " " I 'm not sure . I was fifteen when I knew her and she must have been twenty-two or - three . I 'm not sure . She must have been twenty-nine or thirty , at the time of her death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years . The other girl married and made a go of it . On the surface , at least . She  --  the one I cared for  --  took up flying . She was a fine pilot , daring , cool , relaxed , expert . The men at the field liked her enormously . She was fun , a good sport , keyed people up ; made you feel that something special was about to happen when she walked in a room . And men felt her as much , I think , as women did . "  | " You saw her after camp ? " " Once , by accident . " Yes , I remembered . She had told me , one April afternoon in her living room . She stopped . Seemed to be searching for something . She said , " She was different . It was as if she had just arrived from a country where customs are a bit shocking , perhaps , and exotic but interesting . More than that . She made everybody feel they had missed something important by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She was not afraid of anything in the external world . But inside  --  I think , now , there was a place she had never dared go near . " They felt this , too , I thought , and were attracted by it . " Then  --  one of the pilots at the air base fell in love with her and apparently she was in love with him  --  or hoped she was . They were married . Two days later , she took a plane up and headed out to sea . She radioed , no fuel . They asked her to give her bearings , asked her again and again . Then they heard , Tell Bill . . . it is OK . . . tell Bill he has been wonderful , tell him .. . tell him I tried  --  Her words slid together and that was all . " " And even now . . . it is with you . " " Not the way she died , Dave . It shocked me , yes ; at the time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so young ; and it hurts now , in a way . But I feel . . . it was her death . She had been making it all her life  --  shaping it to fit her exactly when it came . " Last year , yes , we had talked about it . It had come up quite casually , and she had told me a great deal but we had not talked much about the woman 's death . Had life grown , suddenly , too large for her ? or too small ? Strange , how the way you die can change , make over the life you have lived as if there is a hidden design which only your death can make visible . She was saying , " What hurt was not her death but what I let a few words do to my image of her  --  and of me . " Groping for an inner connection she could not find . " And now it is happening again  --  not to me but to my son . " " But this is  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Because Mark has done no wrong . " She had firmly pushed her doubt away . " But it comes rushing back atp218you and you ca n't understand it or yourself or  --  this world  --  " She was trembling and looked much too pale . I suggested that she not talk any more but try to rest . She closed her eyes . Opened them . Said , " I thought it was settled , that I had made my final peace with it . I suppose you never do , quite . " No . You shove it on that carousel tootling its sad-gay music and finally it comes round again and you recognize it and say , So there you are !  --  And sometimes it has shrunk into a small thing and you smile as if at a broken toy ; and then again it has grown big and misshapen and evil and the sight of it leaves you tremblingand sweating and you watch it as it moves along its orbit and disappears and you know it will come again  --  in someone you love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , " That night long ago , Mark said a wonderful thing : You ca n't prove anything that is important to you ; you risk it if you love a person . I believe that . But Andy is too young  --  he does n't know you must risk  --  and he could n't , even if he knew . " Tears rolled from beneath her eyes . " It is so wrong ! If he must doubt , it should be me , not Mark . " We were nearing the city . A big paper mill , a school , a long stretch of field and rough eroded hills slid by . I looked at her . Breathing softly now . Pale . Limp . Why had this come back to tangle with her at the moment she needed all the objectivity she could hold on to ? I was n't sure . Why was Mark suddenly demanding so much of Andy ? I did n't know ; I still do not know . It happens : the blow falls ; and parts of you explode : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can not believe what you see for the old experience has turned over an inch or two and there are no words that fit the new vision . Her breathing was regular now . I hoped she was sleeping . You need to hold on to what is happening now  --  and what do you do ? you swing back into inner space , you are lost suddenly in the pullingtwisting ambiguous experiences of ten years ago , fifteen , twentyI turned away and looked at those fields with the frost on them , and the trees . Most of the leaves were gone except on the redp219oaks and white oaks . A persimmon had lost its leaves but a few of its small purplish-yellow globes of fruit were still hanging on bare branches . The kudzu covering red clay banks was limp and dead . I held on to leaves , briars , brown kudzu , a split rail fence ; I made myself remember a cold frosty Saturday morning when I was a kid and had gone hunting and stopped and rested my gun against a fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet fruit that fell . A little of it . You never want many persimmons . Not a thing unusual had happened that Saturday , long ago . I just remembered it . And then I looked at her , at the shaggy black hair , the curve of cheek , the closed eyelids .. . so young  --  as if there were a few years she could not leave  --  and so terribly old . . . and now I was praying God to give her the strength she had to have . . . and to forgive us our pitiful ways . We were drawing near the airport . I said , " Grace . . . maybe you 'd like to use your lipstick ? We 're getting in now . " She opened her eyes , smiled , dug into her handbag , brushed her hair , carefullyrubbed the lipstick on . We were near the airport . A Piper Cub swoofed low overhead , circled toward the control tower to the left ; two DC-6 's eased over the northern horizon ; a helicopter was churning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clover leaf , was almost immediately in front of the terminal and hunting a parking place . Here , everything seemed curiously rational . I thought that word.  |p220I  meant in order : marked , lined off ; signal lights where they should be ; runways where they should be ; warning signs : watch for low- flying craft , exit , enter , no entrance , where they should be . This seemed real . The rest of it  --  last night , last week , that interminabletime in the car  --  was a disorderly dream : pressing down like a low ceiling as important dreams do , but a dream . I knew I would try to sort it out , later : the store , the Woman , Mark , Millie , the Ilyders , all of it : what she had said , what I had said , what Mark had said , had felt  --  In that car we had strained to respond to an unknown situation and unknown possibilities within ourselves . Where had we got with it ? knowing this much , did we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had entered that had snapped the equilibrium of  --  of what ? of their relationship with each other ? with me ? Words say too much ; and never enoughI picked up her bags , we went inside to the counter . The clerk smiled , said , We were expecting you , Mrs. Channing . Most men smile at Grace ; most find something to say to her . Her offbeat attractiveness sinks in . A porter weighed her baggage . She went to the women 's room . I was astonished at how fresh she looked when she came out : black hair shining , gray eyes full of depth , lips cleanly outlined , a smell of " Tapestry "  --  ( I had asked her , years ago , what scent she used when she wore suits or skirt and sweater ; apparently I should not have said it , for she had laughed and said your sister is right , you do ask funny questions ; then she told me it was " Tapestry . " ) She had put on the single strand of pearls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid she had left her hat in the car , would I mind  --  I went out for it . When I came back , she had misplaced a glove . Seemed enormously distracted , fumbled in her handbag , looked in the women 's room , came back quietly saying , I ca n't find it  --  but her words had anguish in them . I saw it lying on the counter , retrieved it . She smiled , said , " I am behaving like Mother . " We had sgc ' of time on our hands and walked up to the glassed-in terrace . Planes circling , awaiting their signals to come in . One was about to depart : we watched it take off . We did n't talk  --  except the trivia you say at such times . Gray day , cold , nop221wind , no rain , no heavy clouds ; visibility good in spite of strings of fog a foot or so above the ground . Plane coming in from the south . I said it was probably hers but there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in below us . Fire truck moved in . Ground crew moved in . The plane landed rather far out and taxied in . We saw it was hers . We watched the passengerscome down the ramp . We laughed at a worried little man in a checked coat who raced into the building raced out to the plane raced back again and then stopped  --  frozen ; feet turned in , pigeonwise ; he felt in his pocket , pulled out a paper , looked at it , put it in his pocket ; removed it , looked at it , put it in his pocket ; never stirred , after that . We watched the fuel truck drive up , hook on . We watched the crew at their routine work . I said , It is about time . We started down the stairs . Heard the loud-speaker calling my name : David Landrum , David Landrum , telephone . . . booth number four . . . Reverend Landrum . . . telephone . . . booth number fourShe looked startled , touched my arm . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it all right . " I went on ahead . She was following me . I closed the booth door to shut out noise . Saw her standing on the other side : watching , waiting to speak to himMark said , " Dave  --  " his voice prepared me for the next words , " it 's about Andy . " " Yes . " I took care about my face , knowing those eyes were searching it . What he was telling me was this : Andy had gone out for a walk , while Tom Eliot was at the headmaster 's home . He 'd left a note saying he would be back in a little while but had n't come back . Snow was falling when he left ; it had grown heavier , had turned now into a blizzard . They put out search parties , early , had called Mark at four o'clock . No trace of the boy . Were to call again at six . No call . He tried : lines down in New Hampshire . He was taking next plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Ritz Carlton ; tell her if plane ca n't make Boston to phone you where she is , in case she ca n't get me . Do n't tell her I am coming . Tell her heavy snow . Tell her schoolp222will get hi touch with her as soon as they can ; to wait at hotel ; tell her they 'll bring Andy in to see her just as soon as possible . " Would you like her to wait and go up with you ? " " No . Only one seat available . It is better for her to go on . You wo n't tell her about the boy . " I said no . " I 've got it , Mark . I 'll do my best . I 'll keep in touch with you . " I hung up . Opened the booth door . Smiled . Tried not to see her eyes . Said , " He was calling to be sure you 'd made it . " " He did n't talk to me . " Voice soft , hurt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might already have got on . " I sounded foolish , and knew it . But it was all I could think to say . " This is what he wanted to tell you : A blizzardis sweeping across upper New England . If your plane makes it to Boston you are to go to the Ritz and take a room ; if it does n't , if it is grounded somewhere , New York , New Haven , anywhere , you 're to phone him ; if you fail to get him at once , transfer your call to me . If trains are running and your plane is held up in New York , go by train to Boston and wait at the hotel until the school gets in touch with you ; telephone lines may be down so do n't worry if you do n't hear right away . Do n't try to go to the school  --  you might get stranded . Just wait at the hotel . " She said , Yes , she would do what he said . Her face had tensed up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me . I took out my address book , pretended to jot something down . I said , " I 'll telephone the Ritz for a room reservation . " Then I looked at her and said , " If he had called you and you were on the plane he could not have got you . He knew I could relay the message . He 's all right . I told him you were , too , your plane was in , you were about to board it . You 'll be delayed seeing Andy , of course . But not for long , I hope . " They were calling her plane the second time . She searched my face , searched my eyes , did not say a word . I pushed her gently toward the gate . I said , Goodbye dear . I gripped her shoulders and kissed her on the forehead . I said , Tell Andy hi . She tried to smile . I said , Try to sleep a little , after you 've had breakfast . I said , You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Try to pray a little , wo n't you ? I said , Think through what you want to say to the boy but do n't worry ; your love will do it ; your love will do everything for the three of you . God bless you , dear ... . The words stumbled through my lips . I watched her go across the strip to the ramp . She looked as slight as a young girl , bare head , back straight as she ran lightly up the steps . I saw the plane 's hostess speak to her , they smiled at each other ; she turned , I waved , she waved , and disappeared inside the plane . Engines revved up ; plane taxied down the strip , paused , taxiedagain , paused ; engines opened wide , plane lifted , made altitudequickly , turned a slow quarter-turn , headed northeast  --  was gone . I stood a long time looking at the empty sky . I went to the counter in the restaurant and ordered coffee and something to eat . Ate it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they heard me and made a reservation for her . Checked Mark 's space on the plane ; checked the departure time ; everything all right there . Went to the men 's room . To the car . Was halfway home before I realized it was not snowing everywhereon earth . Looked up  --  sometime , do n't know when  --  saw the sun coming out , only a little but enough to pull off the ground-fog and open up a pale winter day . Saw people ; they seemed busy , they looked cheerful , most of them ; a few worried ; a few cold ; nobody looked as if his world had gone to pieces . Saw the frost had disappeared from weeds , grasses . I must have passed Mark 's car  --  perhaps in a town where northbound and southbound cars are routed on different streets . Do n't remember much else about that trip home . Know I arrived in time to get into vestments for the burial service for Mrs. Bailey . Know my mind was completely on her family and their grief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that small bleak chapel at the funeral home . There they sat : old Mr. Bailey and his sister and four cousins and thirty or forty friends . And a gray casket and flowers . . . . And yet  --  in another glass-walled room in that limitless inner space we callp224our mind , were Grace and Mark and a school in New England and a boy and a letter and snow falling  --  and beyond it but somehowa part of it was a little boy named Mark and a father he feared and could not do without and a store and Susan and Henie , a young Grace and Millie and the Woman and a prison in the Pacific , all of it weaving and unweaving , winding , unwinding , twisting , and yet moving implacably toward a point as if this Thing , this disaster just ahead of us , had been fixed at that point in time and during our lifetime we had been moving steadily toward each other , converging on it  --  No . This is a lie . It could have been avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? I did n't know.  --  And yet , as I thought this , I was deeply aware of the family gathered here in this chapel to express their respect and faith and awe , to bear witness before God to an honorable meeting of life with death . To old Mr. Bailey and his sister , Miss Annie , and their handful of friends , this moment was not a dread brush with death but a solemn glimpse , through the cleavage death makes , of God and his wondrous ways . They did not see a hole dug in the ground into which she would be laid : they were seeing a futurewhich God had prepared and they saw it as something much better than the earth had given them , much better for the one lying there who had , at last , been released by God 's mercy from her pain . And I felt their feelings , their unwavering trust and confidenceand hope reaching out to the words I read and entering them , making them larger , more true : I am the resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth and believeth in me , shall never die . . . . Never had those old words seemed so strong , so powerful , so filled with the pathos and the sheer wonderof the human experience as they did at that moment ; never had they been so illumined for me . This was not a monologue I was reading from the Prayer Book but a dialogue taking place between a handful of people and their God in whom they believedunwaveringly . They were what we call " simple people " : They could not have talked about " man 's destiny " or the human condition ; they had only a vague notion of the universe , even ofp225this earth ; they would have thought it not only wrong but completelyirrelevant to ask the big questions  --  as irrelevant as many scientists think but for quite different reasons . But they were as ready to start out on the endless journey into the unknown we call " death " as are the intrepid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be rocketed into Outer Space  --  and they were waving goodbye , with tears and with confidence , to the member of their family who had started on her way , just ahead of them . For them , death was not a crashing end to life but a pushing back of the human frontier , a few steps farther into the expanding universe . Only when I left them  --  when I returned to my rooms , only then , was I grounded again to this earth and its agonizing tearing realities . Once grounded , I was swept by fear , anxiety , torn by angry incredulity . The world I lived in was not the world of old Mr. Bailey and Miss Annie . Their faith which half an hour before had stirred me deeply seemed now to have nothing to do with us  --  it was as if I had read a scene in an old-fashioned book and had responded , warmly , to its quaint simplicity . This , this monstrous thing happening to Andy , to Grace and Mark and all of us : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . No . I was feeling , It ca n't happen ; it does n't have to happenand yet it is happening . This is what tortured me : none of it had to happen  --  and yet it was happening as irresistibly as a Greek tragedy unfolds sequence after sequence . I went up to my bedroom and lay down . Needed sleep . But I could n't sleep . Lay there staring at the blue bowl on my bureau , staring at Niebuhr 's book on my bedside table , looking at my watch , worrying : Suppose she had tried to call while I was at the funeral home or the cemetery or out on the highway . She should be at the Ritz now  --  if she got through . I called Eastern Air Lines : asked if Flight 14 had reached Boston on schedule . They had heard nothing to the contrary . I stayed near my desk most of the afternoon , waiting for Grace 's call . Went , finally , to Matthews for a few groceries . As I pulled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quick . Picked up orange juice at the frozen juice counter ; a stick of butter at thep226dairy counter , a pound of grapes from the fruit counter , a package of Saltines , a can of sardines , two or three other things , a loaf of bread  --  I remember these irrelevant details because of Mai- ( lee : they stick to her . As I took the stuff out of the wire cart and laid it on the slow-moving surface of the counter to be checked out , I saw the checker was Maidee . Tall , bony Maidee  --  flesh never grows on her ; whatever is in her blood makes only skin and big-jointed bones ; and her voice is bony and loose-jointed , too , no tension in her . I could hear her say to Miss Hortense and the others in her slow vague yet terrifyingly explicit way : Yes , he was here . At exactly five-thirty-five . I remember because the quarter slipped out of his hand and rolled . . . . I wanted to shout : Now see what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the quarter . . . . But of course I did not say it . She looked up  --  eyes pinpointed to the dimension of dimes , nickels , bills : was it a one ? a five ? a ten ?  --  She said , Hello Mr. Landrum . I said , Hello Miss Maidee , how 're things ? She said , Fine , you OK ? Fine , I said . I handed her the money , she handed me the change , I concentrated on her hand stuffing my purchases in a paper sack , I gave the wire cart a shove , it slid back into the nest of carts . As I turned away , someone pulled it out of its nest and began the trek around milk counter , frozen foods , dairy , meat , poultry . . . planning Sunday dinner , planningTV supper , planningAt three-thirty , I called the airport , asked if both planes had got through to Boston . They said yes . No planes south of Boston had been grounded until three o'clock . All air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four o'clock , I asked Long Distance if calls were getting through to New England . She did n't know ; would I like to put a call through ? I said yes , to Boston . Gave her the Ritz 's phone number , the Channings ' names . Heard her buzzing Boston . . . heard cracking .. . whistling . . . wheezing . . . then across the noise a Boston voice was talking to her . She told me the Channings ' room did not answer . I asked to be connected with the desk : Were they registered ? Yes . You 're sure ? Mrs. Channing arrived this morning ;  |p227Dr  . Channing in the early afternoon . I thanked him , left a messagethat I had called . Stared down at my desk . Saw a note slipped under the ash try . " Call me , please , at your convenience . Katie . " I was n't up to it . She must have dropped by while I was at the shopping center . Whatever it was  --  and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It reminded me , however , that I had things to do . A sermon to preach , for one thing . It was written . But I needed to read it a number of times to get the sequences and its end in my head . Otherwise I 'd circle like a helicopter in search of a landingspot . I pulled it out of the drawer , read it , forced my mind on it , sketched out a tight outline , read the outline three times . Fairly good sermon  --  but what did it have to do with us , today ? Nothing : no matter  --  it is all the sermon you 've got  --  get it organized . Remembered the appointment I was to make with Claud Newell . Why go through with it now ? Useless . Useless . What would Mark care if  --  The talk with Neel and the Chief seemed to have happened a long time ago . Too long ago to matter now . I felt this  --  and yet I knew it was important to go through with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever  --  no matter what was about to happen , those charges must be withdrawn . But last night  --  I had not come to terms with last night . I had not come to terms with what Grace  --  Do n't try . You ca n't . Deal with what is in front of you , right now . So I called the Newells and Renie answered . We talked about this and that ; we laughed ; she asked me if I had got in touch with Miss Hortense ; I said no , why ? and she said Miss Hortense wanted to talk to me ; she was very upset , she had had a dream about some Communists  --  I told Renie I 'd call Miss Hortense later . Then I asked her if I could speak to her husband . He was at the golf club , she said . " Playing on a day like this ? " Her voice showed surprise . She laughed at me , she said , " It 's a fine day for golf , Dave . Why  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he re/turned ? She hesitated , said she would be glad to . Her voice changed hi that split second of hesitation . Cool , suspicious  --  I thanked her and hung up . Jane . I trust talk with Jane . It was pushing me : Last night .. . Mark . . . the store . . . why did n't he tell us ? why did he withhold it ? Grace . . . all that she had felt compelled to say  --  that plane taking her where she could not go , I was standing t here again watching it , looking at that empty sky  --  I knew now what was ahead . I could not endure the knowledge alone . There was nothing Jane could do for them . Not now . But I felt she could work a miracle for me . It is my role to listen to people . Now Jane must listen to me . I could not see beyond this hour but Jane might see . This feeling I have about her is something my words can not deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suppose I was the small boy who cries out for the arms of the Great Mother . I am not ashamed to confess it . But to say this no more describes my complex need than a comic strip describes a man 's profoundestexperiences . I felt : I felt she would receive this which I must tell her as she receives everything good and evil : as if it had happened ten thousand years ago ; not as bad news or good news but as a sentence not until now deciphered in an old worn human document that somehow , somewhere has been dug up ; she 'd look at it , smooth it out , peruse it with care and compassion and interest . She would not deny . Jane denies nothing . She would say Yes , yes , yes . With sorrow . But she would say it . How she had traveled that long arduous way to the still point of pain , I do n't know . But as I am writing this now , it seems to me that she has somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony the rest of us feel . All the words seem wrong . But she is there . Or more nearly there than anyone I have ever known . Her eyes confirm you : they are like an old sailor 's eyes fixed on an invisible horizon . She reminds you of the Singer in that brief hypnotizing fable of Rilke 's : The men in the boat , rowing rowing across a sea to an unknown destination , going Somewhere , toward a place ten hundred , ten million miles distant , ten million years distant maybe  --  no one knows ; but theyp229keep on rowing with the expertness , the know-how they are masters of , for there is nothing they do n't know about oars and a rowboat and its relationship to the water a few inches from their hands and the wind blowing across their bodies . But what they do n't know is where they are going . And this not-knowing desolates them , exhausts them , they are drained by weariness and non-meaning and terror ; and then , then : one of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unknown point in the future nearer , nearer . . . it is as if it is now coming toward them instead of their going toward it ; and the rowers feel better , somehow , more sure , somehow ; and the oars quicken and the boat moves on a few inches further into the unknownJane does this : Somehow , as your words fall against her silencea resonance is set up , a new sound makes its mark on your mind , and your feelings change . She has an astonishing sense of the faraway place , of invisible order surrounding the near chaos , of a never-to-be-reached harmony that one finds only within one 's awareness that it exists . And at the same time , she has almost a shocking way of dealing with everyday concerns : shrewd and down-to-earth as a peasant in her awareness of the small things people cling to . A doll means more to a child than the whole human race  --  She often says this , and like the politicians , she never forgets it ; and like them she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committees ; the JuvenileDelinquency Committee , League of Women Voters , PhysicalRehabilitation Committee , the Library Board ; she is a director of the Civic Symphony Society ; and she volunteers for the grubby assignments . This is only one layer of Jane  --  the top layer , what she chooses to show the world ; but there must be Janes within Janes , there must be a frightened human in her , somewhere , and an angry one and somewhere a lonely mixed-up one just like the rest of us , there has to be . . . . She was at home now , I knew  --  where she is every Saturday afternoon , sitting in her big chair with feet propped up , a box of chocolates on the small table near her  --  always that box of chocolates  --  and reading Karl Kraus . She had told me , I think it was the afternoon we were up at her mountain place , that shep230was reading his last Days of Man  --  eight hundred pages of it , in the German ; doing it on Saturday afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second time . The winter before , I think it was Dante ; perhaps Lao-Tse or Mo Ti ; perhaps Kierkegaar ( i  --  It was she who had persuaded me to read Kirkegaard in the right way : beginning with Concluding Unscientific Postscript and working back through his last books . I dialed her number . I spoke to her . She said , " Dave ? Good . Where have you been ? I tried to get you all morning . " I told her I had been out of reach of a phone . She asked me where Mark and Grace were . I told her they had gone out of town for the weekend . " Good , " she said . " I hope they went up to their cabin . " I said I was not sure where they were . Could I drop in to see her ? Knew I was interrupting her but I needed to talk with her . She asked me to come at six o'clock and stay for supper . I went over to the window . Saturday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the football game . Saw Susie skating on the sidewalk across the street ; in that Black Watch plaid skirt and cap to match , and that long pale hair streaming , she looked like a Charles Addams drawing . She was skimming across my line of vision . . . . Four weeks ago I could laugh and did ; now she had become uncanny , if she touched you you would feel it the rest of your life  --  She stopped . Crossed over , paused on the sidewalk in front of my study , looked up , saw me at the window , waved , skated on down the streetA few minutes later , Claud Newell called . Voice not friendly . He resented my interference with his life . I did n't blame him . But I was not up to pastoral overtures : instead , I said pretty tersely , I 'm afraid , that I wanted to talk with him as soon as possible . Silence at his end of the line . It is about Susan , I said . Silence . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said , At your convenience . He suggested nine o'clock . ' When I arrived at Jane 's , she was reading and there were the chocolates beside her . She offered me one and I took it . I sat down in a rocker  --  she has three  --  in that quiet , Victorian room ( Victorian , except for her books and records and hi-fi ) . It wasp231once her mother 's , and her mother 's things are still there . I waited as she laid aside her book and went to the kitchen for a few minutes . When she returned , I told her as quickly as I could about Andy and the anonymous letter  --  the phone call from the headmaster  --  Grace 's departure  --  the snow and Andy 's going out for a walk . I pushed it on her pretty fast , I 'm afraid , for as I told it her face paled out and the color did not come back for a long time . But she did not show it in her quiet words as she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mark . She then asked me if Andy had ever mentioned a but in his letters to me . I did n't think so . She went to her desk , found a short letter from him telling her about the school , Eliot , his ( housemaster , then he said they had walked out to a cabin the school had about a mile off the campus . It is like ours , Jane , up on your mountain . We had a good time . " He may have gone there . " It did n't sound quite reasonable . " At night ? " She was looking down at her hands which were clasped together in her lap . She said , " His father always walks when he is solving a problem . Andy may not know it consciously but he knows it . He is not in the least afraid of the dark . It was snowing  --  he may have wanted to stay out in it . On impulse , he may have gone to the cabin simply because it reminded him of theirs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , she looked down at the rug a long time , then she said , " You 've had no sleep , have you ? and no food ? " Not much of either , I admitted . " Then , let 's push this away and have supper . Can you ? " She smiled . I said it was hard to . Said I kept trying to put it together , that I could n't quite see this . She said , " Let 's wait . There is a chance that it is all right . Phones are out , we ca n't hear but they may have found him by now . I think he went to the hut . If he did and saw he should not try to go back to the school , he is safe . He would build a fire and keep warm . " " Would Mark think of this possibility ? " She thought he would.  |p232I  was n't sure he would ; he had been so disturbed , everything piling  --  " Suppose he does n't . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you do . But we ca n't create the disaster in our minds before it happens ; let 's wait until we hear . " Stich simple words , not particularly wise but somehow comforting . It was her and all I knew of her past life , her love , her compassion , her acceptance that comforted me . As we ate her superb food  --  she is a fine cook  --  I asked her once more how did it all start  --  was it Renie Newell ? if so , why ? why ? who wrote the letter ? why ? why ? And once again she said , " Until we know more , let 's wait ; keep in touch if we can , but wait . " This sort of thing , said by most people , can infuriate you ; but said by Jane it seemed right . And with an effort I began to talk about other things . The Kraus book , a little  --  she sketched it out for me , this prophetic German who , before Hitler , had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about a problem Neel had discussed with her , that morning . He had stumbled on a marijuana club of Windsor Hill teen-agers . We went pretty fully into this because some of them were in my church . I asked her if she had heard of Gus Hestor . No , she had n't heard of him . We discussed him , his silent almost invisible trouble-making as if he were not human but a disease spreading through the city . This in no way tied up with the club of young dope users , but what created the climate for one might be creating the climate for the other . And all the time , I wanted to say , Tell me about Grace : she taught dance in your camp ; you were with her that day when she read the account of the woman 's suicide . Tell me about Grace . .. . But somehow , I could n't . It was almost like asking , Tell me about you , Jane : what men , what women have you loved ? how many have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are compelled to find a place to abide where you can not be hurt again ? are you sure you are safe there ? She knew so much .. . but would it ever be told ? Do women ever tell ? They were bred to secrecy for ten thousand years  --  will they ever tell ? They know so much  --  but will they tell ? I felt behind this , this that was happen/fng to the three we loved , a mysterious force that only a few women understand , pushing all of us  --  me , Mark , all of us  --  Windsor Hills , the FlatsShe had put on a Vaughan Williams record . As it played I half listened , but most of the time I was trying to find a young , eager , hurt Jane in this almost ancient rocklike Jane I knew . Claud Newell knocked on my study door at exactly nine o'clock . As he walked in , as we shook hands  --  it was the handshake of opponents and we both felt it  --  I was startled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this similarity in words to Neel and the Chief until I had almost created twins of them . Actually , except for height and weight , color of hair , the slow easy way each walked , they were astonishingly different . Their eyes : blue , yes ; but Mark 's have a steady glow in them and are always looking through and beyond what he sees ; while Newell 's eyes are darting , shrewd , appraising . I swung now to the other pole , seeing only their differences : I saw Mark as a controlled , reasonable man whose brain works faster than his feelings or words , who lives in a world of facts , weighing them , comparing , evaluating , demanding a quantity of them before judging a situation  --  and yet , never satisfied with facts nor with the how ; always searching for the idea behind the fact , the why , the what ; this means that he has access to his imagination and to a large body of knowledge ; he has energy , too ,    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
