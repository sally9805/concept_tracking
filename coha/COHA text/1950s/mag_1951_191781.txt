Night-flying aircraft crews scouting North Korea 's roads last week spotted one of the heaviest enemy movements toward the front since the Chinese Communist crossing of the Yalu . More than 2,000 vehicles were headed through the darkness for the Red lines above the 38th parallel . Night after night , and even by day , the ominous traffic to the front continued . U.N . air strikes attacked it but could not cut it off . <P> The Chinese Communists were reported massing 300,000 men along the highways and railroads below Pyongyang on the west and Wonsan on the east . Soon , perhaps this month or in May , another mightier Red offensive against the U.N . forces could be expected . <P> The Eighth Army moved warily northward . Two U.S. armored columns raided across the parallel on the western flank of the peninsula . One rolled up the main road north of Uijongbu toward Kumhwa ; air spotters , directing artillery , helped it get back again before a Red ambush could be sprung . The second column , thrusting north of the Chongpyong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine-gun fire , but managed to fight its way out to U.N . lines below the parallel . Along the central front above Chunchon , the enemy counterattacked ; the main blow in his anticipated offensive seemed likely to come in this sensitive sector . <P> On the eastern flank of the peninsula , U.N . naval forces bore the brunt of probing the enemy , sapping his buildup , keeping him as much off balance as possible . The port of Wonsan , 80 miles above the parallel and a key traffic hub , was under continuous fire ; by week 's end it had endured 43 consecutive days of bombardment , a naval record exceeding that achieved in the siege of Vicksburg. * Rear Admiral Allan E. Smith , in command of the naval task force off Wonsan , described the operation : " In Wonsan , you can not walk on the streets . You can not sleep any time in the 24 hours unless it is the sleep of death . " The only people in the city , said the admiral , were ' ' suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight a possible U.N . landing . <P> <P> * In the famous Civil War battle of 1863 , Federal ships on the Mississippi during 42 consecutive days fired 11,500 mortar shells into Vicksburg.
