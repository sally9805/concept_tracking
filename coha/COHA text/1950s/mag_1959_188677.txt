THE THIRD ROSE ( 427 pp. ) - John Malcolm Brinnin- Atlantic-Little , Brown ( $6 ) . <P> Renouncing Babbitry for Babel , Gertrude Stein was a kind of saint to some and a stunt to others . She belongs not to the ages , but an age-the ' 20s . Fresh from his last safari ( Dylan Thomas in America ) , Poet-Critic John Malcolm Brinnin goes in search of this Abominable Snowoman of modern letters . What he brings back is not startling , but it is a biographically complete if critically indulgent account of the concentric odyssey of Gertrude Stein , of whom it might be said : in her beginning was her end , because she was all middle . <P> Uncorseted Bliss . German-Jewish Papa Stein was a wool merchant , and some would argue that Gertrude was , too . As a baby , Gertrude , wrote her mother , was " a little Schnatterer . She talks all day long and repeats everything that is said or done . " At Radcliffe , Gertrude became Philosopher William James 's favorite Schnatterer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always seemed to like her own fat , " a friend later said ) . She also experimented in what came to be known as automatic writing . This may have inspired her incantatory rhythms and inane repetitions , though Author Brinnin bristles at the thought . <P> At the turn of the century , Gertrude followed her brother Leo to Paris . Leo was the art pundit and collector in those early days , but he was everlastingly tinkering with his psyche , so that when a San Francisco spinster named Alice Babette Toklas appeared , " soft , small , and warmly murmurous , " Gertrude switched boon companions for life . The two gentle ladies from America enjoyed living in the eye of the bohemian hurricane . There was the writer Andr Salmon , who foamed at the mouth with delirium ( he later claimed it was soap ) and nibbled the trimmings on Alice Toklas ' hat . There was Alfred Jarry , an absinthe-minded playwright who carried a revolver and once shot down " some obstreperous nightingales . " Oddest of all was Gerald Berners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Rolls , and would flash a white mask at villagers , whose terror grew as ghostly strains of Scarlatti wafted from the disappearing car . <P> What Is the Answer ? As young U.S. expatriates ( including Ernest Hemingway ) fled the middle class and the Middle West , they took refuge in " the mature Gertrudian bosom , " as Van Wyck Brooks put it , " much like that of their far away prairie mothers , but of a most gratifying sophistication . Miss Stein gave them back their nursery rhymes and they had fine babbling times together . " As for for own writing , apart from a trio of impressive short stories , Three Lives , The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas , and the moving play-opera Four Saints in Three Acts , Gertrude Stein was not so much the hoaxer as the hoaxed . She tried to purify words by divorcing them from meanings and using them as pigments or notes . At best , the result was a kind of singing noncommercial . <P> Gertrude Stein had survived World War II by a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of anesthesia , she was sibylline to the end . Her next-to-last words were , " What is the answer ? " And her last , " In that case , what is the question ? "
