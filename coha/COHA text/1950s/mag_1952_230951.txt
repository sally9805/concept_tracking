A onetime swineherd , cruel Francisco Pizarro , conquered the Incas and in 1535 founded the city of Lima . After laying out a great square , which he called the Plaza de Armas , he placed the cornerstone for a cathedral on the eastern side . Then he allotted spaces for a city hall and a governor 's palace , to be occupied by himself . In the middle , he added a touch of his own , a gibbet . <P> The gibbet has long since given way to a graceful fountain , but Pizarro 's spirit still inhabits the Plaza de Armas . His mummy , bones protruding through dark yellow skin , lies in a glass case in the cathedral . Lima 's charter , kept in the city hall , shows the double loop the illiterate conqueror used as a signature . The fig tree he planted at the palace still lives . In 1935 , there was added a 22-foot statue of Pizarro on horseback , which dominated the plaza from a lofty pedestal rising out of the cathedral 's steps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism . Many thought , as the newspaper La Prensa said , that the monument " interfered with the architectural ensemble of the cathedral and the cardinal 's palace . " Others argued that the sword-brandishing statue was " too warlike a figure to stand in front of a church . " And Peru 's inarticulate Indians never saw any reason to glorify the man they still consider no better than a heroic butcher . But the church-front spot for the statue also had its defenders , who thought it a " commanding position from which he could seem to keep watch over the city he had laid out and founded 400 years before . " <P> <P> Last week the old conqueror was moved . City architects , demolishing some buildings to give a clear vista toward one side of the big presidential palace which has replaced Pizarro 's old palace , created a small park plainly in need of embellishment . So they simply sent around a crane which plucked the 6-ton statue of Pizarro from its old base and set it in the park . The conqueror 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founded , but , as one of his defenders indignantly protested , " they have shoved him from the parlor to the basement . "
