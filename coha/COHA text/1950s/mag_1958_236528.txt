After the Senate call-buzzers had stopped one noon last week , a visiting minister delivered a timely invocation . Prayed the Rev. Robert W. Olewiler of Washington 's Grace Reformed Church : " Most gracious God , we thank Thee for the miracle of our conscious life by which we behold the wonders of the universe . " Then up rose a Senator who had recently beheld the wonders of the universe with Washington 's keenest political eye . As the opening order of business . Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Baines Johnson moved consideration of a senatorial first step into space , to wit , his own resolution , establishing a Senate special committee on Astronautical and Space Exploration . Under Lyndon Johnson 's sure hand the motion carried 78-1 ; Louisiana 's Allen J. Ellender , who opposes all new committees on principle , saw no reason to make an exception for outer space . <P> In a breathless week , Ellender was only a neolithic holdout . Fired by Texan Johnson as he rocketed to stake a claim in space for the U.S. Congress and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of urgency usually reserved for crop supports and rivers and harbors bills . Example : Johnson and a fellow Democrat , New Mexico 's Clinton Anderson , were scanning the House bill that would give Defense Secretary McElroy authority for his Advanced Research Projects Agency . They decided that McElroy 's franchise would be too broad . At Johnson 's urging , Senate conferees , meeting with the House on the measure , pushed through a provision putting a one-year limit on McElroy 's control over nonmilitary research and development . <P> To the White House . Lyndon Johnson began looking closely at the problems of space 2% months ago after listening to brush-browed Physicist Edward Teller ( TIME , Dec. 9 ) testify before the Johnson Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee . <P> <P> He registered a claim for the Democrats in his own " State of the Union " speech to a Democratic caucus last month : " If , out in space , there is the ultimate position . . . then our national goal and the goal of all free men must be to win and hold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green-and-gold office off the Senate gallery . In between he dictated memos on the double , reread the Senate debates that preceded passage of the 1946 Atomic Energy Act , setting up the Atomic Energy Commission and the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy . <P> Framing his resolution so that it would lay the groundwork for similar legislation on space agencies , he sounded out Democrats and Republicans alike for reaction . Last week , when G.O.P. leaders discovered what he had in mind , they hotfooted it to the White House , warned that Johnson was about to capture another popular issue just as he had captured defense preparedness.
