Not just the question of who is right , but who has most power , was at issue this week in the U.S. 's battle of wills with stubborn old Syngman Rhee . When it came down to it , Rhee had an imposing show of power . How to counter it was the subject of a conference called by Mark Clark , and attended by Army Chief of Staff J. Lawton Collins , Eighth Army Commander Maxwell Taylor and Far East air and naval commanders . Clark &; Co. decided that Rhee could : <P> 1 ) Free the remaining 8,000 anti-Communist North Korean prisoners . Clark has already taken some precautions by moving the 8,000 into two camps under U.S. Army and Marine guards . If a breakout is attempted anyway , Clark ( with Washington 's backing ) has ordered the camp commanders not to shoot to kill or wound , but to fire into the air or the ground and to use non-lethal gases . If most or all of the 8,000 escape in spite of these measures , Clark considers this a lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they care much less about the 27,000 already turned loose than about U.S. ability to get on with a truce . <P> 2 ) Order the Korean Service Corps ( more than 100,000 Korean porters and others working for the U.N . Command ) , the dockworkers at Pusan , Inchon and other ports , and the railway workers to leave their work . In a time of active combat , with the front in need of a steady stream of supply , such a move by Rhee would be crippling . If the fighting in most sectors is at a standstill , as it now is , the move would be only a serious inconvenience . <P> 3 ) Refuse to abide by the truce , and attack the Communists . Clark is already considering a redeployment of front-line units so that the eastern two-thirds of the line will be solidly held by ROKs , the western one-third-guarding the approaches to Seoul-by non-Koreans . Without U.N . air support , ammunition , fuel and tactical advice , the ROKs would have little sustained offensive strength . Their only hope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get involved in the battle too , if only to preserve their own flanks . <P> Looking on , the Peking radio betrayed something akin to sympathy for the U.S. predicament . It no longer called Rhee a U.S. puppet , and even for the first time spoke of the U.S. as a democratic nation . Rhee 's actions , said Peking in a July 4 broadcast , constitute " an insult to the spirit of independence and democracy of the American people and their ancestor , Washington . " If these nosegays are any index , the Reds are as anxious for a truce as ever - perhaps more so .
