One of the best youngster programs in Manhattan last week was a puppet show set to music . Austria 's famed Salzburg Marionette Theater gave three matinees in one day ( starting at 10:30 a.m. ) for successive audiences of delighted small fry . With a few changes in the bill , it proved that it could also fill Town Hall with grownups in the evening . As befitted a troupe from his old home town , the Salzburgers did much of their work to music by Mozart . <P> Grownups got Bastien and Bastienne , a one-act operetta composed when Mozart was twelve ; a mime and dance based on Eine Kleine Nachtmusik ; a playlet , Mozart Visits the Empress ; and a ballet , The Dying Swan , featuring a puppet Pavlova to music by Saint-Sa " ens . <P> Salzburg 's Director Hermann Aicher , in the U.S. with his group for the first time , has been puppeteering Mozart and assorted fairy tales since 1926 , when he took over the business from his father . Aicher , 48 , his wife Elfriede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , run the show with three assistants , design the puppets , costumes and sets for the 27-ft. stage . The dolls ( adult size : 3- ft. ) are more supple and lifelike than the popular U.S. or Howdy Doody brand ; Cupid shoots arrows , musicians fiddle , puppet birds fly , angels flap their wings , flowers open , horses prance . Aicher &; Co. synchronize action and gestures perfectly with tape-recorded music and dialogue . <P> The Manhattan performances are the last in a tour that has taken the marionettes to 50 cities in the U.S. and Canada in three months . Director Aicher was particularly pleased with their reception in Texas . " It was such a surprise . Even the cowboys liked us. "
