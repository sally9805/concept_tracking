txt Every 14 years Boston real estate owners are forced to " re-buy " their property through local taxes based on a $70.70 rate that Mayor Hynes is expected to declare today . This figure was not definitely established at press time , but Mayor Hynes has indicated that " before the close of business today , the rate will be set close to that figure . " Last year the rate was $66.80 . In 1944 it was $39.90 . On the 1944 rate , it took 25 years for a taxpayer to pay as much in taxes as his property assessment . The difference in dollars and cents to Boston taxpayers since 1944 also presents a startling picture . A home assessed for $6,000 in 1944 , for example , was taxed $239.40 . If the 1953 rate is $70.70 , the tax bill will be $424.20 . In the last year of former Mayor James M. Curley 's administration ? in 1949 ? the $56.80 rate was labeled " confiscatory . " Critics of the administration charged that the taxpayers would rebel , and refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills were paid and continue to be paid at record-breaking percentages . First reports at City Hall this year were that the rate would be $69.50 , which was deemed more than satisfactory , since the public had been led to expect a rate closer to $73.80 . At the last minute , however , it was discovered that $1,900 , - 000 for school purposes had been left out of the tax rate computations . When included , it pushed the rate up to between S70.60 and $70.80 . In fairness to Boston , argue some municipal experts , the high rate in Boston includes many services not usually considered by taxpayers . These defenders of Boston 's high taxes point to Boston 's highly rated police and fire departments . In some communities , sewerage is not provided . In others garbage and refuse collections are an additional expense . They point to other services , too numerous to mention . Other arguments are that residential properties are assessed lower in Boston than in comparable communities . An effort to prove this through a revaluation program was denied Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council . Other major cities in the country , says Mayor Hynes , have a much broader tax base than Boston . Here , more than 70 per cent of the city 's budget is raised from real estate taxes . Other large cities average closer to 50 per cent , since they have such other taxes as the sales and payroll taxes ,
