txt In the next year and a half , President Eisenhower a budget hatchet is likely to pi ove as effective as a pen-knife . Just two months ago Mr Eisenhower said that , because of using defense costs , " we shall have to make some tough choices " in the Federal Government 's civilian projects ; " savings of the kind we need can- come about only through cutting out or deferring entire categories of activity " But the budget the President submitted yesterday for the 1958-1959 fiscal year does not suggest that many tough choices were made or that many categories of civilian programs are being cut out or deferred . It 's true that , if the Administration sticks to the economy proposals in this budget and if Congress shows equal restraint , then some alerts of civilian spending would either decline or rise less rapidly in the fiscal years after 1959 . Meantnne , however , the total ' - en il benefits ' spending projec led for fiscal 195n itself is mammoth in am , standard The estimated cost of these ilian programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion budgeted fm the current 1958 fist al seat ending net June 30 This is a net m echo lion , though tied : n the budget to a $700 million ' Nista ! rate mei ease which Congi eSS may not approve , it s.nuld anpear that the pi oposed rate increase thus masks an in foal rise in " civil benefits " spending : Mu ' cove ' . the c laimed $600 million drop assumes lower spending for price supports by an amount that Agriculture Department officials do not consider realistic And the 1959 ' ' cis 11 benefits " figure is actually $1 3 billion more than was spent for these purposes as recently as the 1957 fiscal year which ended last June 30  --  a period not noted tot low Feder al spending . Another Record This largess on the civilian side , plus the mounting cost of defense , is the reason the nation has been gix en for 1959 another ' ' record peacetime budget , " $1 1 billion more than now estimated for 1958 and $2 1 billion more than the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $71 8 billion . which set off last year 's peat budget battle The 73 9 billion total for 1959 is not much below . the Kw can War high , and if stri , tlY ompaied would be higher That is because in 1951 highway penchtui es were part of the regular budget now most of them are segregated in a trust fund Had they been included . the 1959 spending budget would be $76 1 billion , compared with the Korean peak of $71 3 billion Ironically in a way , what helps hold estimated total 1959 spending down to $73 9 billion are cuts in defense activities- not , to be sure , in missiles and such , but in so-called conventional weapons and in troop strength These outlays show a projected decrease of $1 5 billion in 1959 below 1957 On civilian spending , however , it 's a different matter Here are some of the choices and what they do or do not amount to The President is thawing his quest , which Congress declined to approve last teal , for Fedeial aid for school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since in its place lie wants $1 billion for a four-year program for scholarships and Winn educational and scientific ventui es La/Rely for this reason , spending under the general category of " labor and welfare , " which includes education , is to be $200 million more in 1959 than In 1958 . Up and Up It can be argued that education and science are intimately connected with defense and SO not a fair example of civilian spending On the basis of MI Eisenhower 's stated policy , though , one would then expect compensating cuts in the - labor and welfare " category , instead , outgo for many programs is up , not down The total in this category is not only $200 million higher than 1958 , but nearly $709 million higher than in 1957 Or consider the compartment called " commerce and housing " The $1 6 billion of spending in this field , while supposed to be lower than in 1958 , would be $174 million higher than in 1957 . A number of people question whether the Small Business Administration is an absolute necessity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be drastically pared The Administration evidently thinks It is essential , for the budget asks that this " temporary " agency be made officially per manent , and asks new money for it For some years the two biggest hunks of " civil benefits " have gone to veterans and farmers These , if anywher e , are the areas where many people believe the substantial savings needed to pay for the increased costs of defense could be found No substantial savings are found in this budget , however Spending for veteians , at just OVCI $5 billion , is down a negligible bit born 1958 and is some $200 million above 1957 E ? spenses for agiii lino/ e are reckoned at 54 6 billion . $300 million less than in 1958 , but slightly abase 1957 Changed Emphasis What , then , has happened to the hat ( hat Mr Eisenhower cleat lw depicted in his speech two months ago " One Loge thing that has happened to it is the deepening business adjustment , requuing. according to the " compensatory " theory of economics , continued high Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend that the cutting edge has completely melted as far as its possible eventual effects are concerned There are enough recommendations on curtailing civilian enterprises in this budget to add up to a distinct cliange of emphasis from the 1958 budget presented a year ago In that blueprint the ! e were clear lines pointing to constantly rising civilian spending over the years In this one some of the lines have been chopped or redirected . For example , no new starts on water resources projects are proposed And here are some other indications of a considerably less sti ess " We must exet else the utmost restraint , " says the President in the budget message , " in assigning new programs and responsibilities to the Federal Government . and we should continuously search out those programs and activities now carried on at the national level that can and should be handled by the States or localities " That 19 not merely ihetoilc , some proposals have al-1 eady been made for transferring expenditures and revenues to local Government units , and more will he made If they were carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paving for Services Also , Mr. Eisenhower proposes that Government credit programs charge adequate interest rates on all , new loans , which could pr esage a more conservative Federal interest rate structure ; " wherever possible , " moreover , private financing should be substituted for Government loans and mortgages . The President has some new suggestions for having the beneficiaries of certain special Services pay for them And this budget , unlike the last one , is not asking money to study juvenile delinquency and some other local phenomena . Even in the big subsidies for veterans and farmers , some hope of lower spending in the future is discernible on the basis of this budget The Administration is advocating changes in both programs that , if adopted , would have that long-range effect One practical trouble with this more moderate approach is that it hits some of the programs , like those for veterans , farmers and water works , that are dearest to Congressional beams Another difficulty is that none of it would have any appreciable effect on spending in fiscal 1959.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
