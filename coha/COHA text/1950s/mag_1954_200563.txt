While the Communists looked on and sometimes laughed , the West spent most of the week stepping on each other 's toes , complaining , apologizing and explaining themselves to each other . <P> An overexcited and incomplete report of Dulles ' press conference ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) came to France 's Georges Bidault in the midst of an afternoon session . Set-faced and grim , Bidault accosted the U.S. 's Under Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith the minute the session was over . " What does this mean ? " he demanded bluntly . Smith hastily telephoned Washington for a full transcript of Dulles ' press conference . <P> Even after reading it a few hours later , Bidault was only partly reassured . Said one French diplomat : " When you said Korea was outside your security line , the Communists attacked . What might they do if they believe you will not fight for Indo-China ? We had felt that the U.S. was resolved to save as much as possible of Indo-China . Now how can we feel ? Only that you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only the first blow of the week for Bidault . Bidault had sworn that if the Laniel government fell , he would remain at Geneva as representative of a caretaker government even if he had " to go back to France every two or three days and stump the country " for his policy . The actual vote ( see below ) , with its majority of two , was almost as bad . <P> When he could , Bidault stood off the cocky Communists with the only weapon left to him-native wit . When Tep Phan , Foreign Minister of Cambodia , denounced the Viet Minh invasion of his country and produced a telegram reporting the murder of three Cambodians by Viet Minh rebels , Molotov was scathing . " We have heard about this telegram , but we have n't seen it , " he declared scornfully . The Cambodian minister waved the telegram aloft . " Now we have seen it , but we still have n't read it , " snapped Molotov , to the laughter of the Communist delegations . <P> Bidault stood up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing , " he said . " I should like to point out that the laughter did not come from the free nations ' benches . " The laughter stopped abruptly . Amid dead silence , Molotov arose and admitted sheepishly : " I agree with the French Foreign Minister . " <P> One-Sided Respite . Into the vacuum left by the collapse of the U.S. 's hastily laid plans stepped Britain 's Anthony Eden . To the Communists ' charge that Russia and China are the sole champions of Asian nationalist aspirations , Eden pointed out that since the war , India , Pakistan , Burma and Ceylon have all achieved independence from Britain . " Therefore I resent and reject the suggestion that we ignore or oppose the tide of national feeling in Asia , and I ask : Where is there real national freedom-in Colombo or in Ulan Bator capital of Outer Mongolia , in Delhi or in Pyongyang ?
