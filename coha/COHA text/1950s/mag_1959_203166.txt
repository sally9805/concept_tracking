Only In America ( by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee ) tells the story of Harry Golden , editor ( The Carolina Israelite ) and author of the bestselling Only in America . The stage difficulties involved are immediate and persistent . The adapters really have little to dramatize beyond a genially hard-hitting personality that best conveys itself in the first person , and a pungent egalitarian philosophy of life that seems blatantly pious when acted out . Adapters Lawrence and Lee must , in fact , swell out into two hours of theater what is not only ill suited to the theater , but what even in book form comes off best in ten-minute draughts . <P> They have brought Golden ( Nehemiah Persoff ) to Charlotte , N.C. , introduced him around , and planted him in front of his typewriter . They festoon him with homely metaphors and Yiddish phrases and good , bad and indifferent jokes . They show him gradually , despite his embattled stand for integration , winning the hearts of all his white , Southern , Gentile neighbors . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spades-the unsuspected fact that Golden had once served time in prison for mail fraud . It overhangs his life , until at last it breaks out in the headlines-only for all who know Harry Golden not just to rally round him but to render him homage . <P> That the adapters should so much magnify what everyone in the play is quick to minimize is proof of their desperate need for dramatic material ; Golden 's queen of spades is their one theatrical ace in the hole . Only in America has , certainly , its lively moments and amusing details , but it chiefly conveys a sense of stretching already flimsy materials-of building small incidents about Negroes or Jews into unctuous minority rites . Clearly the basic trouble with Only in America is that it should never have been a play . But the thought persists that only on Broadway , with its headlong opportunism , could it ever have become one .
