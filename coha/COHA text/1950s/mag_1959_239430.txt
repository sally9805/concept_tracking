At the windup of the National People 's Congress in Peking last week , a new Chairman of the Republic took office : dour , self-effacing Liu Shao-chi ( see box ) . With the announcement , Peking 's vast Square of Heavenly Peace resounded to the beating of gongs , the clash of cymbals , the rataplan of exploding firecrackers . Demonstrators marched 110 abreast in a swirl of red banners and colored scarves . The usually gloomy and provincial streets blazed with electric lights strung on eaves and curving roofs ; red stars and neon signs shone against the night sky ; big , pumpkin-shaped lanterns dangled from the gates of the Imperial City . <P> So far as the outside world could judge , Red China 's leaders were in the process of providing for the succession , and doing so with an apparent unity that-whatever else might be said about his regime-was a tribute to the organizational skill of Mao Tse-tung . They acted at a most delicate time , with a revolt in Tibet , with economic disorder at home , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard for Asian opinion . <P> " Foul Hogs . " It was easy for a dictatorship to fill the streets of China 's cities , from Nanning in the south to Harbin in the subarctic north , with marching thousands , who obediently shouted the identical tongue-twisting slogans : " Smash the foreign interventionist plot to undermine China 's reunification ! " and " Oppose the rebellion in Tibet instigated by the imperialists and foreign reactionaries ! " <P> Since the Tibetan revolt against Red rule could not be explained away , it had to be shouted away . The horror expressed by neutral nations at Red brutality was answered by strident threats ; even India 's docile Prime Minister Nehru was pictured as an archvillain who is holding the escaped Dalai Lama " under duress . " Now India joined the list of monstrous enemies : Formosa , Britain , the U.S. , even tiny states like Thailand and Nepal . " We will never allow those foul hogs to poke their snouts into our beautiful garden ! " shouted a Congress delegate . <P> Plainly , Red China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be deceived by propaganda , they must be quieted by fear . Red China 's truculence also served another classic function : at the moment , Peking needs internal pressure more than it needs external friends . <P> Useless Pig Iron . At Wuhan last December , the Central Committee of the party had to recognize that 1 ) the frenzied bombardment of Quemoy had failed to shake the nerve of either Formosa or the U.S. , and 2 ) the ruthless jamming of peasants into rural communes had disorganized the nation . Ships lay for as much as two weeks at Shanghai docks awaiting loading and unloading . Textile mills lacked raw material ; exports fell off ; production was declining everywhere . Thousands of tons of pig iron were turned out by backyard furnaces but then proved useless without further costly refining ; there was not enough cement to build barracks in the communes . Lacking transport , harvests rotted in the fields while food was scarce in the cities .                  @ @ @
