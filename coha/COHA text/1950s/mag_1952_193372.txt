Strange and painful things are happening to South Africa 's armed forces . One by one , the officers who led South African forces in World War II have been booted out or shunted aside . Before he died , Good Soldier Jan Christian Smuts was relieved of his honorary post as commander in chief . Deputy Chief of Staff William Poole was sent packing on an unimportant military mission . But that was not all . <P> Inspired by his dislike of the British crown , demagogic Premier Daniel Malan has been reinstating officers who refused to fight in what the Nationalists called " the British war , " and moving them into commands above the officers who had served their country . Malan 's Defense Minister , a handsome , rabble-rousing politician named Franois Christian Erasmus , combed the armed forces with " grievance commissions " to reward those who had ducked the war . <P> The Skietcommando . Erasmus concentrated mostly on his own private Nationalist army , called the Skietcommando and modeled after Hitler 's SA and SS troops . He ordered the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South African naval men , required all military textbooks to be translated into Afrikaans . Propelled , like all the Nationalists , by a fanatic mixture of hatred and fear of South Africa 's browns and blacks , Erasmus even disbanded the effective native and half-caste units with which Smuts had built up the South African army . <P> In reaction , South Africans have resigned in droves from the armed forces to join the ranks of Torch Commando , the anti-Malan political rally formed last year by a young South African air force ace , " Sailor " Malan , who is a distant cousin of the Premier Malan he fights . " Not a single self-respecting white man " would join Torch , a Nationalist minister once prophesied . Last week Torch claimed two of South Africa 's most distinguished soldiers . One was General George Edwin Brink , C.B. , C.B.E. , D.S.O. , Croix de Guerre . The other was General James Thorn Durrant , who was eased out this year as director general of the air force . General Brink , who commanded South Africa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had happened to his country 's armed forces . " Soldiers who were disloyal . . . get preference . . . " he declared last week . " We who have fought are now called renegades . " <P> Spies &; Counter Spies . Defense Minister Erasmus flippantly dismissed the attacks as " complaints of disappointed men , " but privately he and Malan 's Nationalist regime were worried . They issued edicts barring soldiers from joining Torch , and sent spies into barracks to root out secret Torch members , only to discover that many of the police spies themselves are clandestinely allied with Sailor Malan 's movement . In addition to rolling up a membership of 200,000 South Africans who want a drastic-but democratic-change in government . Torch is enlisting the country 's best and toughest soldiers .
