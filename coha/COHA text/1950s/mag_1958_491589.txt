I Call On Edward R. Murrow I did n't like the way my interview with Edward H. Morrow was shaping up and I told him so . I said , " When your co-producers , John Aaron and Jesse Zousmer , sent me a list of thirty-five questions and suggested that I put them to you , I thought , If nit ' questions and answers are both going to Ie handled by your staff , I might at ad ! let Jou inter New your-mg , " A week before , Aaron and Zousmer had had a talk with inc . When I 'd told them that it was my habit to use a tape recorder rather than a notebook and pencil , they had seemed unpleasantly startled . " We 'll be happy to have a C.B.S . sound technician sit behind a soundproof glass wall and tape-record your interview for you , " they suggested . " In addition , we 'll have our own typist type the words from your tape . Then we 'll look it over to make sure she has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize now that I had been overtouchy , and too quick to jump to a conclusion , but I 'd gotten the general idea that they thought I might take a " negative " point of view when I called on Murrow ? " negative " being Madison Avenuctc for " antagonistic . " Nothing was further from my mind , but a little more of the implied censorship I had thought I was running into would have made me as " negative " as all get out . Aaron and Zousmer sat with Ed Morrow and me now , ready to rake part in my Murrow interview . We were seated around a table on a radio sound stage in the C.B.S . building on Madison Avenue . It had taken a certain amount of gall for me to mention that I thought I 'd been spoon-fcd the questions I was supposed to ask , but in my book the idea of a carefully screened interview was obnoxious . When J mentioned the list of questions I 'd been given , NI urrow seemed surprised . I was n't at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised he made a quick recovery . He said , in his deep , rich bass , " I am in your hands . " And he pulled out a cigarette and lit it . " The questions John and Jesse sent me were good questions , " I told Morrow , " but I 've got some of my own I 'd like to ask you too . " " Go ahead , " Murrow said . " I know what you mean . In the art of interviewing  --  if it is an art  --  questions have a tendency to flow from the preceding answers . " Perhaps I should add that once we began to talk , Aaron , Zousmer and Morrow could n't have been more co-operative . " Of the more than three hundred and fifty Person to Person TV interviews you 've done , " I asked Morrow , " which one did you find the most nerve-racking ? " " I 've really choked up only once , " he told me . " That was for about ten seconds when I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janus the air . During our conversation she ducked behind a screen to change into a ballet costume so she could anionstraie a step for me . She was tugging off her clothes and I WU% still talking to her , when I happened to took at the right-hand corner of the screen which concealed her . I saw something that threatened catastrophe ; a power line had conic loose during a rehearsal and suddenly it seemed to me that it was going to come loose again , knock that screen down , and the girl was going to stand there before millions of people as bare its the day she was born , It was the only time I ever felt something was about to happen on the air that I could n't handle . " " Ed told us afterward that if we 'd ended up with a naked French girl , " Aaron put in , " lie was going to say good night and good luck to the public , get up out of his chair and go quietly home , " Everyone smiled at the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything for a moment . could n't stand it . " Well , what happened ? " I asked . Murrow spread his arms in shrug . " Nothing , " he said . " Oh , " I said with a falling inflection . " Another tough problem I encountered was when there was a technical failure on one of our remotes thirty seconds before air tine , " Murrow- told mc , " and I had to switch to our other remote . " When I 'd first heard the word " remote " I had n't the slightest idea what it meant . Since then I had learned that a remote is a TV session which originates outside a studio . " You mean you had to switch the two halves of your show around ? " I asked . " I was all braced to interview a Hollywood actress , " Murrow said . " Then , thirty seconds before air time , one of these two monkeys " ? his eyes swiveled to Aaron and Zousmer , then turned back to me ? " rushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we 're going to do the college professor first . ' The professor was a scientific type , and I had to shift my mental gears . With things moving with the terrific speed they assume as air time approaches , it was one of the hardest things I 've ever tried to do . " Zousmer said , " Ed does a bigger hat-changing job than anybody on TV . " " He means if I interview Tito . " Murrow said , " I put on my Tito hat ; then I take it off quickly and put on my cartoonist 's hat or my actor 's hat to interview a cartoonist or an actor , les as if you were trying to write a piece on fallout , then a few minutes afterward beginning a series on Marilyn Monroe . " " The two things arc not too different , " I said . " Zousmer and Aaron told me you call your preshow preparation a co-ord . " I added . " Tell me about a co-ord . Do you sit in the studio and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do they talk hack to you ? Can you get to know those people in a half hour or so ? " " Yes , " Murrow said , " that 's how we do it , but we do n't have a half hour together during a cu-ord. 1 have about fifteen minutes of chitchat with each person I visit before we take to the air . Our crew also uses that fifteen minutes for checking their camera positions and for lighting . During that time we go over what we 're visiting isiting is going to do at the any given point . If we 're visiting a woman we want to know whether she 'll be walking from the kitchen to the dining room ar out onto a balcony , and if so , when . We never rehearse our questions and answers : That way , although the person I 'm visiting knows my general line of questioning , I do n't know the answers I 'll get . " " Has someone on your staff already talked to your personalities of the evening ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However , once we 're on the air , my policy of conducting myself as if I am physically a guest in their home limits my questioning . That makes it impossible for me to pry as deeply as some other interviewers do . " " I 'd like to add something to that , " Aaron said . " There have been occasions when the persons we arc visiting are as jumpy as cats , but the moment they heard Ed 's voice in the co-ord a psychological change seemed to take place in them , It 's as if he were actually physically there , patting them reassuringly on the head . " " I know you have a huge screen in your studio on which you can see them , " I said . " Do they have a screen on which they can see you ? " " Our guests have no monitors , " Murrow said . " 1 can see them , but they ca n't see me . It 's a one-way affair . We wire a little squawk box into each room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those boxes . " " That was Ed 's idea . " Aaron said . " lie had the feeling that the people we call on  --  particularly the women  --  would spend so much time watching themselves on the air and worrying about how their hair looks and whether their make-up is on right , they 'd forget what they 're supposed to talk about . " I said to Murrow , " They tell me that you sometimes turn to the wife of a man you 're about to visit on the air and say , ' We may not bother with your husband at all . We may just concentrate on you , ' and that you do this to inject a light note and loosen her up . " " I 've done that several times when a wife is still tense and nervous after ten minutes or so of co-ord conversation , " Morrow told me . " When you said that to Mrs. Sid Caesar . I hear she was horror-struck , " I said . " She was afraid you really meant it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did alarm her , I 'm afraid , " Murrow said . " But by and large , on our program , females have saved a lot of males . I do n't think either Richard Rodgers , who wrote the music for South Pacific . Oklahoma ! and Carousel , or Sam Goldwyn would have agreed to go on our program if they had n't known their wises were going to be on hand too . 1 sensed that both of them relied on their wives to support them , sustain them and even rescue them , if necessary . I take no credit for knowing that certain wives arc towers of strength . Any perceptive person , after spending fifteen minutes with a man , knows the extent to which he relies upon the woman he 's married . " Then there 's the other type , " Murrow told me , " There 's the guest who forgets his wife 's name . when he 's introducing me to her on the air . We had one like that , " " Who was he ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Murrow said , " and I wo n't mention his name . He 's in enough trouble now , what with losing his sponsor . " " What about the successful man who marries when he 's struggling upward ; then outgrows his wife ? " I asked . " The way life usually works out , we have him on our show after he has outgrown her and he 's married somebody else , " Zousmer said . None of us said anything for a few momerits . I could see that I was n't awing to get any more fill-in on the story of what had happened at the Sid Caesar home when Marrow had tried his easing-upthe-wife stunt . Changing the subject . Morrow told me , " I never sec a kinescope of one of my shows . " " I doubt if you grasp the full meaning of what Ed just told you , " Zousmcr said , " since you 're not in television , but I do n't think there 's anybody else in this business who can say , ' I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's got to be a reason , " I said . " There is , " Murrow said . " Each Monday , John , Jesse and the rest of my crew sit down and do a brutal post-mortem on what I 've done the preceding Friday night . If I 've done anything wrong timing-wise or movement-wise , they tell me about it Monday afternoon . They arc my kinescopes . I3ut to answer your question specifically : I 've never looked at a kine for this simple reason : I do the best job I know how while I 'm on , but it embarrasses me to look at myself on film or hear my own voice . " hy ? " 1 persisted . " I think my own voice is mush-mouthed , but I do n't let it give me a mental block . " " All I can tell you , " Murrow told me. " is that I 'm an old-time reporter  --  I guess I always will be one  --  and if I have to watch myself on a screen I feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same feeling about listening to p ! aybacks of my voice on radio , I 'm even embarrassed that being on TV has destroyed my anonymity and I 'm recognized here and there . " " I do n't get it , " I said . " Do you suppose ham actors are embarrassed when they get jobs as reporters , if they el.er do ? " " I ca n't explain it any better than I 've already done , " Murrow said . " Our biggest problem is putting our guests at their ease , " he went on . " 1 try to make them feel they do n't have to remember cues or think about moving from here to there . I tell them I 'll take care of those thing for them . Occasionally when we have people on Person to Person I do n't know well , the question rises what should they call me . John and Jesse tell me that 's usually one of the last things our guests ask be-foie going on . Ordinarily they start calling roe ' Mr. Morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three or four minutes they change to ' Ed . ' " " Of all the people he 's interviewed , Sophie Tucker is the only one who 's called him ' Eddie . " ' Aaron said , " I hate being called ' Eddie , ? Murrow confessed . " But in her case it was all right . Sophie can call me anything she wants to . " " I hear you have a theory that athletes arc easiest to interview , " 1 said . " They 're so used to taking instructions from managers and coaches they 're relaxed when you tell them what you want them to do , " Murrow said . " When you say , ' At this point I 'd like to have you get up and show your trophies to the audience , ' they du a . A good example was Yogi Berra . I began our co-ord by talking with him and his two children . They were climbing all over him and Yogi was having trouble with them , and I said , ' I hope we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV camera squarely in the eye and said , ' I ai n't sweatin ' , Mr , Murrow . Why should I ? Nobody 's comin ' in here with his spikes high . ' Roy Campanella was the same . Rizzuto was good too . " " Relaxed and easy . " Aaron said . " What kind of mail do you get ? " I asked . " We do n't get a tremendous volume , " Murrow said , " arid only a small amount of it is critical ; and occasionally our mail Taws a changed attitude on the part of the viewers toward an individual . When we visited Mrs. Roosevelt , there was a fair amount of letters which said , in effect , ' We 've never liked the Roosevelts , man , boy , child , woman , root , brunch or dog , but this past Friday night Mrs. Roosevelt was a charming and likable elder eitizeness . We have altered our opinion of her . ' " " Do you ever get personal criticism ? " I asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told rne. " 1 got my biggest anti-smoking mail the week before 1 interviewed Billy Graham . Most of it came from religious people who said , ' We do n't ask you to give up smoking altogether , but we would appreciate it if , in deference to Billy , you would n't smoke quite so much while you 're talking to " John and Jesse told me you get a lot of the kind of mail which says , ' We have somebody in our home town we think you ought to visit . ' Do you ? " " I do , " Murrow told me . " But there 's not much I can do about it because John and Jesse keep saying , ' You have to have names that are household words . ' l think they 're wrong and we have an endless amicable argument over that . " " We 're not opposed to Ed 's doing an important person who has an unknown occupation . such as a curator of a museum . " Aaron told me . " We regard those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a case for not doing real unknowns who are anonymous except to their immediate circles of relatives , neighbors employers and fellow em-ployees , " " Last spring we did two men who are relatively unknown , " Morrow said , " and even John and Jesse had to agree that it was one of our best shows . One of those two was A. C. Nielsen . He runs the Nielsen rating service and commodity research . The other was the author , H. Allen Smith . He is known to those who read his books and his articles , but he 's relatively unknown to a mass audience . " " I disagree with you about Smith , " I said . " His face may not be as familiar as his name , but he 's well known to a lot of people . " " Anyhow , they were both interesting , " Morrow said . " And the show moved . Smith has that rare thing , a sardonic sense of humor . As he strolled about his home , he passed an organ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Tot me. ' he said . ' I hate amateur musicians . ' " . Lielsen gave us a plus we had n't counted on too , " Murrow went on . " He is a man whose rating service has made or destroyed the careers of many television stars . His research is based on a small gadget he attaches to a television set . It records who 's looking at what , and when . ' You put this little capsule on , ' he told me on the air . ' Then you put this little thing on there , ' only when he tried to do it none of it would work . He had to make three passes at it before he got it right . I 'm sure our viewers got a boot out of seeing him struggle with his own pet invention  --  and lose temporarily . " " We 've done a couple of real unknowns who embarrassed us and our audience , " Zousmer said , " because they did n't know how to handle themselves in public , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd made a mistake . " " The tone of the letters we got after that gave us pause , - Murrow ' said . " ' If want to sec how the average guy lives , ' some of those letters said , ' I can visit my relatives . I do n't want to waste half an hour and use the magic of television to see how some ordinary Joe lives . ' What they want is the vicarious excitement of visiting places and seeing people they would otherwise never meet . " " That 's a had word we 're using , that ' unknown , ' " Zousmer said . " Nobody is unknown . " " How about ' average ' ? " Aaron suggested . " We 've done average people , " Zous. river objected . " There 's really no word for what we mean . " ? " The trouble with most of the suggestions we gel from viewers , " Murrow went on , " is that they do n't add up to arty-thing . Two weeks ago we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do us ? We 're an average family . We have three kids and Mr. Murrow will love our mi. vale skating rink . ' We had a look . The skating rink was a normal , average-size concrete cellar fixed so water would freeze in it . It was not only not a skating rink , the ceiling was so low we could n't have got our cameras and equipment into it . " If our show has had any success , " Murrow continued , " it lies in the fact that it consists of extraordinary people doing ordinary things . We put the actor Raymond Massey on the air , and let our audience see and hear him tinkering in his woodworking shop . The combination of the elements fame and an everyday hobby held an almost universal appeal , " One of the things I 'm sure of , " I said , " is your courage . The first time I was aware of you as a television personality was when you spoke your mind about Senator McCarthy , although millions of people disagreed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See It Now , not on Person to Person , " Marrow told me . " I thought you were only interested on Person to Person . " " I am primarily , " I said . " I just wanted to detour for a moment . " Murrow said slowly , " I think television is too timid . l think it ought to be a mirror held up to what 's going on both here and abroad . If the picture reflected in that mirror is one that gives people pride and gratification in what is happening , all right . lf , on the other hand , the picture reflected is one of bigotry , dishonesty or violence done to the Bill of Rights , it 's television 's job to hold up that mirror just as steadily . " We can even get into an area of international misunderstanding on Person to Person too , " Murrow said . " Take Krishna Menon , for example . " I 've known Krishna Menon for twenty years , " Murrow continued . " and when he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours is stupid . You 're intelligent . You should n't have asked it , ' I let it ride . When I asked him whether he went to many United Nations ' social functions . he said he did if he was invited . Then , for no reason , he said to me , ' You 've never invited me to your home . ' That was baffling to me , since he had been to my home two or three nights before . My problem was whether to get into an argument with him before millions or people , but I decided not to make a point of the fact that he had been in my home . " thought he was wrong . He should have told millions of viewers about Menon 's peculiar idea of the truth , but I kept it to myself . " Nor do I go into a guy 's home as a guest when he 's surrounded by his wife and children . " Murrow said , " and say , ' I do n't believe in you , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a perfect example with Nielsen . " Zousmer told me . " Ed is on record as far back as the 1948 election as saying he had no faith in pollsters , statisticians , and , by the same token , rating services . When Ed was interviewing Nielsen , he had enough facts , intelligence and experietc ! with Nielsen 's business to say , ' I can ' Mime in your rating system . You ca n't tell inc that by using twelve hundred gadgets on twelve hundred TV sets you can decide what sixty million viewers watch . ' But Ed did n't think his show was the place for that kind of talk . " " How did Person to Person originate ? " I asked . grew out of many conversations Johnny and Jesse and I had , " Murrow said . " One night we were having a bull session about the most common human emotion . Near the top of our list was the sexual urge . but we had to rule that out so far as television is concerned . Our next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we narrowed that down to curiosity about how well-known people live . One of us  --  I do n't remember which  --  said , ' No one can walk down the street and pass a window with the blind up and the lights on without looking in . Ws irresistible . ' So we concluded if we could move our cameras inside the homes of interesting people and show other people how they Ilse , everybody 's natural curiosity would give us our audience . " " Should we tell him where we held those conversations ? " Zousmer asked . " In a bar , " hlurrow said . " Did you dope it out in one session ? " asked . " The sessions took place over a period of two or three years , " Murrow said . " All in the same bar ? " I persisted . " Frequently . but not continuously , " Murrow said . " Once in a while we took a fresh-air break . Properly used , we thought TV could be an instrument of transportation which could take people places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication instrument it has always been . " There base been times when our idea has turned out to he a two-edged sword , " Murrow went on . " There was my interview with Shelley Winters . It was a normal , straightway interview until I asked , ' What kind of world do you hope your little girl will grow up into ? ' It was a routine question I sometimes ask when I run out of anything else to say . I did n't know what her answer would be , but when I put the question to her , she took a deep breath and said , ' I hope she grows up in a world dedicated to the principles and philosophies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt . ' Right in front of the millions who were listening in , I had to tell her that since it was during a presidential campaign , what she 'd said was a straight political Plug . out of place on a program like mine . ' If you say a thing like that , I must give someone else equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following week f gave forty-five seconds to Jinx Falkenburg. who happened to be a Republican worker , so she could have her say . A lot of the mail about the Winters , sh.ow came from Democrats who said , m voting the Democratic ticket and I 'm an admirer of Adlai Stevenson , but I kit bad when that woman pulled a fast one on your show . ' " It 's only fair to say that our first Person to Person show did not attract glowing reviews , " Murrow said , " One of the critics simply said , ' Morrow should have hung up . ' The trouble was that the review-ers could n't accept In ) sudden transition from news analyst to interviewer . That was my wife 's reaction too . She liked the show , but her attitude was that I was giving up any reputation I might have won as a war correspondent and commentator on international affairs to do a show which would appeal to those who read Hollywood fan magazines . Then one summer we were driving through the Caeraac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television antennis on their roots , and suddenly she said , 1 do n't suppose these people S. travel very much . Maybe your taking them to meet the people they meet on your show is a useful thing . ' " On the other hand , once I aehteved some recognition on TV I began to receive invitations to du lectures on subjects about which I knew nest to nothing . I turn almost all of them down . Unless you watch it , there is a tendency For you to think that because your voice and your picture arc transmitted from one end of the country to the oilier , you 're more intelligent and more important than you were when your voice only reached from one end of a bar to the other . " " How do you decide who your guests will he ? " I asked . " We deliberately set out to get contrast , " Morrow told me . " It 's our theory that if you were going to visit two people on a Friday night you would n't deliberately visit two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same evening , One evening we paid a visit to Liberace and to the famous lawyer , Morris Ernst . You 'll have to admit they 're quite a contrast . " " That pairing off odd people interests me , " I said . " That is not our word , " Zousmer said . " That 's yours . They 're not odd to us . We have a big audience ; we must give it variety . " " If we pair our guests right , " Morrow said , " we give them an audience they can never get in any other way . On Person to Person when we presented Prof. James T. Shotwell , of Columbia , a great historian and scholar , we paired him with Ed Sullivan . Shotwell has spent years lecturing on the League of Nations , the International Labor Office and the United Nations , but he had never had any contact with a television set until I asked him to go on our show . A couple of days afterward , he told me , ' I 've spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fifteen minutes , I talked to more people than all the people I 've ever talked to . " ' " Do you run into people who 'd rather not be on your show ? " I asked . " We occasionally encounter someone who regards it as an invasion of his privacy , " Murrow said . " Then there are those who say they do n't want to expose their children to so much publicity , and there are some who claim they have nothing to say . The Duke and Duchess of Winds , , r kept Sayilig blot . but we did n't give up for three years , and finally they said yes . This brings up the matter of the Duchess as a jacks player . In her autobiography she said she was the best jacks player in Baltimore . When 1 told her I did n't believe it , she said , ' I have n't played in twenty years , but if I had some jacks I 'd prove it to you . ' take care of that , ' I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacks and a small rubber hall , and sent a messenger to her suite with them . Next day when t dropped in to see them for lunch , the duke said , ' Thanks to you . I did n't get much sleep last night . The duchess stayed up practicing jacks until three am . About one o'clock in the morning she lost that little ball , and I spent a long time under the furniture looking for it . ' " Suppose you have to go out into the country , " I asked . " Do rural lines carry enough juice to supply the power you need ? " " Sometimes we have to put up a pole or poles , " Murrow said . " Frequently we have to put up a tower a hundred and forty feet high so our dish will be high enough to throw a beam at the transmitter . When we did Ezzard Charles and Rocky hlarciano , we had to slice forty feet from the top of a small mountain with bulldozers . If we had n't , the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to get a line-of-sight from our point of origination to the nearest transmitter . whether that transmitter is on the Empire State Building or on a mountain near Hollywood . " I talk glibly about these things , " Murrow said , " but , although I started in radio in 1935 , the only technical thing I know about electronics is that the long waves are actually shop and the short waves arc really long . My natural reaction is that it is impossible for TV to reach out as far as it does . I 'm accustomed to being recoanized in New York and Washington and Chicago , but when I stop for a hamburger in Washington State and a waitress recognizes me , my instinctive reaction is , ' 1-tow does she know who I am ? ' ' " Is there a limit as to how far you can go ? " I asked . " There is , budgetwise . " Morrow told me . " Theoretically , given enough time and money , we can go anywhere on the North Amcru .. in cunitrient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's not unlimited . " Every year when we go off thc air at the end of a season . " Murrow said , " we talk of a dream dinner we 'd like to give . We 'd like to invite every guest we 've had all year long and seat them exactly the way they were seated in relation to each other on our show . We 'd like to put Roy Campanella next to Leopold Stokowski and football coach Earl Blaik next to dress designer Valentina , and so on . Then we want to record their conmachines. on hidden tape-recording " I 'd like to tell you about thc unsung heroes of our show , " Murrow went on . " I 've tried this with every writer who 's ever written is story about me , and every editor asks , ' Who cares about them ? ' and takes them out . The technical men on our program are fabulous . They 've worked one-room houses and sixty-three-room houses . We 've even had a shot of the kitchen of a Chinese junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . Sometimes I see a camera shot that simply is impossible . We did one like that from a lighthouse . We took our viewers up that lighthouse with us until we finally reached the light . ft was then that our technical boys pulled one that astounded me . The earn-era got to the very top ; then it backed off so that I could sec the light and the railing around it , and f shook my head because I knew they could n't do what they were doing ! ' That cameraman must be hanging from a balloon ! ' I said , I discovered later he had only two legs of his camera perched on a catwalk around the outside of the light . The camera was leaning against him and he was strapped to the railing , leaning out as far as he could . sixty feet above a pile of rocks . " Joe E. Lewis came closest to leaving me speechless during a show , " Murrow said . " We were going along fine , when , near the end , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to you . then out gushed a freshet of unintelligible words . ' Sounds like Norwegian , ' I said . ' What is it ? ' " ' l do n't know , ' he said . ' I read it on a sardine can . ' If we were n't scrupulously honest we 'd record some of the conversations before and after we 're on the air , " Murrow said , " and we 'd really the thevesoatmne. beauts . Take our visit with h cal critic , John Mason Brown . On our shows everybody wears completely self-contained concealed batteries and a microphone  --  actually a tiny sending set . Men usually carry the battery in the hip pocket . During our co-ord about five minutes before air , our producer went up to him and said . ' hlr . Brown , I 'd like to recharge your battenes . ' John looked back at him and said , ' Young man , not even God can do that , ' " " Which reminds me of the time we did a Person to Pelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her case we planned to stuff the battery pack down the front of her bosom . She naturally preferred to stow it away herself rather than have one of our technicians do it for her , but with no one to supervise her stowing , she placed the head of the microphone against her wishbone , " " Is that had ? " I asked . " Is it bad ? " Morrow asked . " During the eleven minutes the show lasted we could hear her heart beating , boom . boom , boom . Sometimes it went fast and sometimes slow , but afterward we had fifty to seventy-five letters from doctors who said , ? Tonight I listened to Miss Winsor 's heartbeat. if you see her , tell her it is a perfectly healthy organ. ?
