Corliss Lamont , son of Morgan Partner Thomas Lamont , has a long record as a Soviet apologist and a sponsor for Communist fronts , including a term as chairman of the National Council of Soviet-American Friendship . In its investigation of the Institute of Pacific Relations . Senator Pat McCarran 's subcommittee has made great play with Lamont 's name as an Institute member . <P> Last week , in a letter to McCarran , Corliss Lamont , now a lecturer in philosophy at Columbia University , made some sharp points . Lamont protested that the subcommittee " has tried to give the totally false impression that I am a Far Eastern expert and have been a prime mover in the affairs of the Institute . . . But in fact I have never been particularly interested in the Far East and have for only a few years been a member of the Institute , and a very inactive one at that . <P> " However , my late father , Thomas W. Lamont of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , did have considerable knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twenty years he participated actively in the work of the Institute of Pacific Relations and contributed generously to it ... On the other hand . I did not start contributions to the Institute until 1946 . From that year until the present I made six donations totaling $800 , or about one-eighteenth of the total of my father 's gifts . Yet your subcommittee and its investigators have never once mentioned my Republican father 's long and deep interest in the Institute . Instead , this subcommittee has stressed my own slight and brief association with the Institute , obviously as part of its effort to paint the institute as Red by concealing the fact that leading bankers and conservatives have been among its chief backers . " <P> Lamont pointed out that he differed from Communists in supporting free speech for all ( including Trotskyites ) , that he supported Tito , that he condemned Communist aggression in Korea . Said Lamont : " It seems to me that your subcommittee is constantly encouraging the violation of the Ninth Commandment , ' Thou shalt not bear false witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wrote Lamont , " I am a radical American dissenter carrying on as best I can the dissenting tradition of my ancestors who came over in the Mayflower . " <P> McCarran 's committee had other and solider evidence against some staff members of I.P.R. It had hurt its case by exaggerating Corliss Lamont 's influence on the Institute .
