txt Secretary of State John Foster Dulles is in London practicing the art of " brinkmanship " in reverse . It was Mr. Dulles , it is recalled here , who not many months ago at the height of the Formosa crisis was lauding the ability " to go to the brink " of war without faltering . In London today , the United States Secretary of State is working overtime to draw the West back from the brink of war over Suez . Today the roles are reversed  --  with the secretary determined to pull his British and French colleagues back from the brink whereas it was the United States ' allies in the Formosan crisis who were all for quieting Mr. Dulles and retrieving him from the cliff 's edge , as the better part of valor . News reports to the contrary , the United States is not in disagreement with its allies over the necessity for international control of Suez Canal operations . What difference there is comes over the degree of such control ? not the need for such control . Ships Delayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believe that United Nations control is the answer . The trouble with UN control or operation is that while it may sound good in theory it gives little promise of being workable in fact . There are just too many ways of stalling , of avoiding appeals , of snarling things up with red tape to make UN operation or UN appeal meaningful , it is felt . The British and French make the point which has not been much publicized , that the UN Security Council has already called Egypt on the carpet for practicing discrimination among canal users  --  but with no results . Cairo still holds up Israeli ships and is demanding all kinds of new information about cargo destinations  --  to be sure they are not destined for Israel . So London and Paris feel that appeal to the UN is not the answer , neither do they think , with Washington agreeing , that UN operation is workable . It is pointed out that the various trusteeships set up by the UN are actually administered for the UN by individual or specific nations . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , . does not think the former will work and is not prepared to give the latter a try . That does not mean , it should be pointed out , that there should not be some link between whatever operational control is set up and the UN . The world bank , for example , has direct but loose ties with the UN ? so has the International Atomic Agency that has been agreed to . But to the West it is axiomatic that UN direction does not ipso facto assure impartial use of the canal , and to assume so would be dangerous if not disastrous . No Final Solution So the three Western powers are united in their conviction that some kind of international operation of the canal is necessary ; any disagreement there is is on the amount of such control and the degree of Egyptian participation that could be permitted . What is obvious even before this conference meets is that it will not end with a solution but only at best chart a solution . Whatever is agreed to at London has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London merely opens a series of talks on Suez rather than consummating a solution for Suez . The West 's opposition to Colonel Nasser 's actions is not that he nationalized the canal company but that he presumably intends to operate the canal by himself and only for Egypt 's good as he sees it . It is all right to nationalize the company ( though they do not approve of the way he did it ) but it is not all right to nationalize the canal . The company mgy be national , but the waterway is international  --  and no fiat by Colonel Nasser can unmake its internationalism . It is possible , even probable , that the London conference may not even come up with an acceptable formula  --  acceptable to all the participating countries . For the formula must be international enough to satisfy Britain and France , but national enough to mollify Egypt . It must be said as fact that , so far , a middle-road formula that London , Paris , and Cairo can all accept is not in the offing . This London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weeks  --  with 10 days about the expected duration . Lloyd clarifies hint to use force in Suez crisis : Page 5.
