The agora of ancient Athens was the nearest thing to the birthplace of Western civilization . Primarily a market place , it served as university , town meeting , news and gossip center , gathering place for poets , artists and philosophers . For years archaeologists of the American School of Classical Studies have been excavating at the site of the agora , removing some ten feet of dirt . Last week they were busy restoring the Stoa of Attalus , one of the agora 's main buildings . <P> The Stoa , a long , two-story promenade of white marble , was given to Athens by Attalus II , King of Pergamum ( 159-138 B.C. ) . On the second floor were 42 small shops , presumably serving the Athenian carriage trade . The ground floor behind the row of tall columns was a social and cultural center , where poets , philosophers and politicians met . With the help of about $1,000,000 of Rockefeller money matched by a like amount from other U.S. sources , the restorers are gathering the surviving stones . They are sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . <P> The philosophers and poets are gone , and the 42 little shops will never again sell the subtle art work of the classical age . But by approximately 1957 , visitors to Athens may stroll under the columns and imagine what the place was like when the Apostle Paul , who also strolled in the Stoa , chided the lively Athenians for spending " their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing .
