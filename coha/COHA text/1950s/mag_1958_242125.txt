U.S. neglect , real or imagined , of local economic problems was one of the major charges thrown at Vice President Nixon along with stones and spittle on his turbulent good-will swing through Latin America . After Nixon returned home , one of the main points in U.S. reappraisal of Latin American relations was that reasonable U.S. aid should be promptly and cheerfully given . Last week the U.S. cut through red tape and delay to lend Chile $25 million and Colombia $103 million . <P> Of Colombia 's $103 million , $78 million came from the Export-Import Bank , the rest from 13 private banks . Announced purpose of the loan was " to assist in maintaining Colombia 's essential imports from the U.S. " Colombia is suffering from a 3,000,000-bag coffee surplus . Without the dollars the coffee could bring in , the country can hardly keep up with its current U.S. commercial debts . The choice , outlined in April by Colombian Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Sanz de Santamaria : either the U.S. could grant a loan or Colombia would have to risk wrecking world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. loan helped save the world coffee market . <P> Approval of Chile 's $25 million came so rapidly that details-including formal signing of the loan agreement-have yet to be ironed out . The Export-Import Bank will probably put up $15 million ; the rest will most likely come from Mutual Security Agency coffers . Even the use to which the money will be put is not certain , but basically the loan 's function will be to provide a dollar prop for Chile 's sagging peso , hard hit by a world slump in copper prices . Last week the peso was so shaky ( off from 493 to the dollar to 780 at the free-trade rate since April , 1956 ) that Chileans were forced to stop all imports from the U.S. by ordering importers , before taking delivery , to deposit 10,000% of the import item 's value in an escrow account for 90 days .
