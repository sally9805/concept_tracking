Malayan Schoolboy Ahmad Bin Abdul Aziz read the article with mounting anger and made his vow . To defend the honor of newly independent Malaya , and prove the hardy spirit of its citizens , he would hitchhike around the world in ten years , giving the lie to the libel and leading " a wandering life of privations . " His pilgrimage tipped politicians off to the article , and they howled hard and loud at the " yellow " journal that printed it-oddly enough , the Encyclopaedia Britannica . <P> The EB 's pukka sahib summing up , written when few Malayans were able to read it ( 69% of the population is still illiterate ) and carried in every edition since that of 1910-11 : " The Malays are indolent , pleasure-loving , improvident , fond of bright clothing , of comfort , of ease , and dislike toil exceedingly . They have no idea of the value of money , and little notion of honesty where money is concerned . . . They are addicted to gambling , and formerly were much given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high if judged by European standards . The sexual morality of the Malays is very lax . . . " <P> Last week Pilgrim Ahmad , 18 , had made progress . Editor in Chief Leslie C. Hoffman of the Straits Times Press , Ltd. , which publishes a string of newspapers in Malaya , wrote to the Britannica : " While not doubting the author 's qualifications , I feel that he has neglected to do justice to his own intelligence . . . You would surely never permit a sentence such as ' Englishmen are addicted to gambling ' or ' the sexual morality of Americans is very lax ' to appear . . . I do hope that you will agree that the passage is not becoming to the Encyclopaedia . . . " <P> From Chicago , EB Managing Editor John V. Dodge wrote an abashed reply : " I wish to say that we are embarrassed by the paragraph you quote . . . It obviously should have been dropped long ago-and I can not say why it was not . " Dodge added that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Richard Winstedt will revise the passage , written in part by the late Far East Hand Sir Hugh Clifford . For the laundered article , Editor Hoffman 's Singapore Sunday Times dryly suggested an addition-a learned footnote on footsore Schoolboy Ahmad.
