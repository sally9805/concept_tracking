The Student Prince ( MGM ) goes overbored with too much of everything-songs , singers , CinemaScope , Ansco Color and plot . Apparently not content with the original book and music , Producer Joe Pasternak put his writers to work plastering the story with additional coats of synthetic Teutonic whimsy . He selected Composer Nicholas Brodszky to show Sigmund Romberg how it should have been done by whipping out three new numbers , including an egregious ballad called I 'll Walk with God , which is sung with straight-faced solemnity to the corpse of Louis Calhern . Actor Edmund Purdom plays the romantic Prince Karl , but behind Purdom 's facial motions is the stentorian voice of Mario Lanza , who is now considered too fat for films . Ann Blyth in blonde braids trills high notes , totes foaming mugs of beer , and bewitches the Heidelberg students . <P> There are still some nice moments , as when the student chorus breaks into the familiar Drink ! Drink ! Drink ! But the good moments are spaced infrequently in the welter of lackluster dialogue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes of being dazed and deafened , after watching the grandiose piled teeteringly upon the preposterous , moviegoers may conclude that they have spent their time not in unfamiliar Old Heidelberg but right at home in good old Hollywood . <P> Johnny Guitar ( Republic ) is one of those curious composite animals , like the tiglon , the hippolope and the peccadillo , that most people would rather talk about than see . This one is a crossbreed of the western with a psychoanalytic case history . Somehow , strains of Greek tragedy , Germanic grand opera and just plain better-class suburban living have also slipped into the mixture . <P> The story is a series of switches on the old railroad line . The ranchmen do n't want the track to cut through their open range . Vienna ( Joan Crawford ) , the madam of a gambling hall and a big land speculator , is understandably all for progress .

What 's more , she is not just the usual jealous woman but a real sexo-logical square knot who fondles pistols suggestively and gets unladylike satisfaction from watching a house burn down . In the end it is the women , not the men , who shoot it out , and Mercedes gets her death wish while Joan gets her man .
