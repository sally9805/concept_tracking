In five years as a Moscow correspondent for the New York Times , Harrison Salisbury has worked under a double handicap . In Moscow Russian censors never passed a word of his copy that did not fit the Communist line ; in New York the Times usually ran Salisbury 's dispatches with no warning that the stories had been passed by the world 's most ironhanded censorship . As a result , his reports often read more like Red propaganda than accounts of what was really going on inside Russia . Salisbury himself was even accused of being pro-Soviet or a fellow traveler . <P> Last week , back in Manhattan at his own request for reassignment to the Times 's city staff , Salisbury was able to answer his critics by writing " for the first time . . without the restrictions of censorship or the fear of it . " His 14-part series was not only a well-written , fresh , firsthand report on Russian Communism . It also vividly demonstrated how misleading many of his censored Times stories were . ( Wailed Manhattan 's Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Moscow and the opposite from New York ? " ) Explained Salisbury : " This is the real story , not the emasculated one that was all that fearful censors permitted correspondents to cable . " <P> Wit &; Charm . Since Stalin 's death , wrote Salisbury , Communist Russia has undergone a complete " new look " as drastic as any change in its whole history . In the face of domestic turmoil the new leaders of Russia have abandoned " Stalin 's bludgeon for more graceful tactics . " Russia is now ruled not by a single dictator but by a group or junta . In comparison to Stalin ( " Georgian suspicions , a mountaineer 's narrow hatreds . . . the midnight habits of a proscribed revolutionary , the wolflike morals of a hunted bank robber " ) Salisbury found the junta composed of an outwardly pleasant bunch of men who thus , as a Western diplomat said , " are more dangerous than Stalin . " <P> The junta consists of Premier Georgy Malenkov ( " full of old-fashioned grace " ) , Nikita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Minister V. M. Molotov ( " quiet , patient and reasonable " ) , Lazar Kaganovich ( " likes his liquor " ) , N. A. Bulganin ( " handsome and witty " ) , A. I. Mikoyan ( " probably the sharpest and cleverest of all " ) . All are about the same height ( 5 ft. 4 in. ) , and all have the common secondary goal of convincing their own people and the West that the " Stalin terror " is over . But Salisbury emphasizes that the change is only on the surface ; their primary goal remains the same : worldwide Communist dictatorship .
