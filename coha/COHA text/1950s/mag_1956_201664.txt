Ask Frenchmen where France 's famed Radical Socialist Party stands , and nine out of ten will first explain that it is neither radical nor socialist . " Their hearts are on the left , their pocketbooks on the right . " wrote Commentator Andre Siegfried . Someone else has described them : <P> " They are like radishes , red on the outside , white inside , and always surrounded by plenty of butter . " Last week , gathered in annual conference , the Radical Socialists sat down for their traditional congress luncheon in the gastronomic paradise of Lyons in hope of enjoying their butter , not to mention truffled pate , quenelles au fromage and assorted other delicacies . But they were not allowed to eat in peace . <P> A longhaired , blue-jawed little man in a tight suit kept glancing at his watch and staring at his colleagues . " But we 've got an hour , " protested one Radical . " Only 50 minutes ! " snapped party First Vice President Mendes-France . Then , at the fourth course ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I realize it 's against all civilized rules , " he said , " but I must say a few words before the dessert . The renovated Radical Party intends to start anew by beginning its sessions on time . " <P> They 're Mendesists . This was not the first Radical precedent shattered by ambitious ex-Premier Mendes-France . Since taking over the party leadership from ancient ( 84 ) Edouard Herriot 17 months ago , he had organized a party press and a political-action school for young party members , increased party membership by 30,000 . As a result the Radicals , in decline since World War II laid a shadow over their 19th century republicanism , were moving toward a comeback-one that Mendes hoped would eventually return him to a position of power . In last January 's general election they polled 13% ( 2,500,000 ) of the votes , now have 55 Deputies ( out of 586 ) in the National Assembly . Last week at Lyons the old leaders in their black coats , wing collars and walrus mustaches looked askance at the new Radicals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in ponytails . " They 're not Radicals , " said one , " they 're Mendesists . " <P> In the glass-ceilinged Bourse du Travail , decorated with 54 tricolors and huge quotations from such Radicals as Philosopher Alain ( " Everything would rot without the Radical salt " ) , Mendes-France set out to reconcile the two wings , the old and the new , of his party . His first move was to have the congress confirm his expulsion of former Premier Edgar Faure , who , by his precipitate dissolution of Parliament last November , brought on the general election before the Radicals ( or Mendes ) were quite ready for it . He then won re-election as Vice President by a vote of 1,298 to 202 . The oldsters ' reaction was to demand the election of an ex ecutive committee that would curb his action . But the oldsters were outnum bered , outmaneuvered and outvoted by the youngsters .
