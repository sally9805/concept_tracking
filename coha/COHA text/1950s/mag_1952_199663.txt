Delegates to the triennial synod of the Church of England in Canada , meeting in London , Ont. last week , suggested that the Ten Commandments , as recited in the Church of England 's Communion service , could stand some improvement . They recommended that the Biblical text generally called the " eleventh commandment " be added . It reads : " A new commandment I give unto you , That ye love one another ; as I have loved you , that ye also love one another . " *Explained the Rev. R. F. Palm er , one of the motion 's sponsors : " We feel this change is necessary to give the commandments more punch . Because people 's morals are not good enough today , there is a crying need for the revival of these commandments in everyday life . " <P> *John 13:34.
