It was Sir Anthony Eden 's busiest week since winning the British general election last May . Constantly on the move , from his country estate at Chequers to the English Channel , then north to the Scottish harbors , the Prime Minister talked and listened respectfully to the soldiers , sailors and airmen who man Britain 's armed services . Eden 's object was to brief himself on the problems-and possibilities-of streamlining British defenses at a saving to the harassed Treasury ( see above ) . <P> <P> Eden left Chequers in a helicopter ( the first British Prime Minister to travel in one ) and flew straight to Farnborough , site of Britain 's famed annual air show . There , with his grey head tilted back over his immaculate white collar , he studied the performance of the flashy jet bombers and fighters on which his government will spend most of its defense money . Most spectacular of the zooming jet planes was a delta-wing Vulcan bomber , that slow-rolled over the field . " Would you like to fly home in one ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Prime Minister said . <P> Eden , bundled up in a flying suit and flight helmet , climbed the narrow ladder into the belly of one of the Vulcans , and took off in a whoosh of jet exhaust . The Prime Minister directed the huge aircraft as far as the English Channel , took over the controls for one long stretch , then landed at an airport near his home in London . " Wonderful , wonderful , wonderful , " said Eden scrambling out . " It was as smooth as a magic carpet . " <P> <P> Next day the Prime Minister arrived at the field training headquarters of the 3rd British Infantry Division . Eden , who won the Military Cross for gallantry in World War I , clambered in and out of armored vehicles , crawled into underground field defenses built to withstand the blast and radiation of atomic bombs dropped 500 yards away . " Pretty ancient are n't they , sir ? " said a youthful sergeant when the Prime Minister inspected his living quarters . " They 're awful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> With Britain 's H-bomb expert , Sir William Penney , Eden examined supersecret atomic arms depots , wearing a long white smock and rubber boots as protection against radiation . Next week he will set off for Scotland , where the cruiser Glasgow will take him to sea . The 58-year-old Prime Minister is scheduled to transfer by wire from the Glasgow to a British aircraft carrier traveling at full speed .
