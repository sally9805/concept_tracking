Italy may not be the mother of bureaucracy , but it has created one of the greatest broods of them all . From 70,000 bureaucrats in 1870 , when Italy was united , to 635,000 under Mussolini , the government 's rolls have swelled today to more than a million . As well as the government can determine ( and it is not sure ) , it has 1,150,000 employees , whose paychecks account for half the national budget . This total includes schoolteachers , but not another 600,000 persons employed by provincial and local governments . <P> Government efficiency experts estimate that only 20% of the civil servants really try to help the hapless citizen who must do business-and battle-with the state . The rest either do little or do nothing , throughout their easy workday from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m . By law , nothing can tear even the indolent and the inefficient from the payrolls except criminal conviction for repeated flagrant insubordination , which must be proved in a formal trial . Ministries are loaded with " temporary workers " who stay until death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice put them on the rolls as " prison guards , female , temporary . " <P> The multiplication of bureaucrats does not make it easier to get things done , but harder . To justify their jobs , bureaucrats proliferate their duties . One intrepid Italian insists that he had to fill out pounds of forms , in triplicate , for the files of nine different government offices , just to build a house . An Italian soldier , wounded in 1943 and certified in 1946 as 50% disabled , finally got on the pension rolls last month ( with no retroactive pay ) . A businessman who filed a tax refund claim six years ago received the acknowledgment last week ; he does not expect the refund for years . People who years ago ran two words together in telegrams find themselves summoned by registered mail , told to fill out forms and wait for hours to pay 3 for the extra word . <P> Pay Out . Recently police called on a Bari citizen , who had paid a fine in 1935 for skipping the Fascist pre-military course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( .088 of a cent ) . And not long ago at great output of bureaucratic labor , the government began paying off Sicilians for damage inflicted by troops of King Francis II during Garibaldi 's campaign in 1860 . Biggest payment : one-tenth of a cent . <P> Ghostly survivals of Mussolini 's " Second Roman Empire " still exist-the Bureau for the Colonization of Ethiopia , the Imperial African Transport Commission , the Commission for Control of Albanian Banks , etc . Under a decree of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1819 , deriving from a contract made in 1594 , the government still ceremoniously pays Naples $21 every year for the upkeep of military orphans . It still advertises old scholarships that pay 16 a year to the winner-even though it now costs 32 to apply . In the Rome recorder 's office ; all documents are still laboriously transcribed by hand-five times . <P> Payoff . When new Treasury Minister Giuseppe Medici , 49 , announced last year that the time had come to prune this octopus , Italians shrugged . But by last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim : " For the first time in Italy 's modern history , the payrolls are going down instead of up . " He has liquidated 50 bureaus ( including one with 14,000 employees ) .
