JAPAN 'S PREMIER <P> Said Secretary of State John Foster Dulles as Japan 's new Conservative Premier got set to make his first official call on Washington this week : " This visit is very important and comes at a formative period in the relations between our two countries . There is a growing feeling in Japan that a new stage is approaching in its relations to the rest of the world , and I hope and believe that we will have a chance to talk that over constructively . " <P> <P> Tte Premier : Nobusuke Kishi , 60 . <P> <P> Early Career . Born in Yamaguchi Prefecture , 70 miles from Hiroshima , son of a poor sake manufacturer and an aristocratic mother ( her father was a samurai ) who demanded perfection . Nobusuke ( meaning : defender of the trust ) was a child prodigy at school , specialized in German law at Tokyo University , graduated at the top of his class ( 1920 ) . With offers of teaching posts , he chose the civil service , joined the Agriculture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1926-27 ) in the U.S. and Europe studying the steel industry . Posted to Manchuria in 1937 , he was a top economic czar of the Japanese-occupied territory . In 1939 , aged 42 , astute Kishi returned to Japan as Vice Minister of Commerce and Industry . <P> World War II . Invited to join militaristic Premier Tojo 's wartime Cabinet , Kishi served for three years as Commerce and Industry Minister , resigned in 1944 after a showdown with Tojo over military strategy ( Minister Kishi wanted to sue for peace if the U.S. landed at Saipan ) . Arrested by the U.S. in 1945 as a suspected war criminal and put into Tokyo 's grim Sugano Prison , Kishi mopped floors , cleaned latrines , had " plenty of time for soul-searching " until his release in 1948 ( he was never brought to trial ) . Kishi regards his prison term as the turning point in his life : " In Sugano , I learned to see men for the first time really stripped of convention and pretense . I began to get a new idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the war had been futile from the start , and that I should have tried to stop it . I became convinced that Japan must never again be involved in war . " <P> Political Career . Well established as a business tycoon ( pulp , chemicals ) when finally " depurged " in 1952 , onetime Bureaucrat Kishi took a long , hard look at resurgent Japan . went into politics . He soon became the dominant figure in the backstage maneuverings from which : 1 ) Japan 's two big feuding conservative parties , the Liberals and the Democrats , were merged into the gigantic Liberal-Democratic Party and ranged in solid opposition to the Socialists and Communists ; and 2 ) Kishi himself emerged last winter as Foreign Minister under 72-year-old Premier Tanzan Ishibashi . Four months ago , Nobusuke Kishi became his country 's Premier ( and his own Foreign Minister ) when Ishibashi resigned because of bad health .
