Is there a shortage of doctors in the U.S. ? And if so , why ? One reason , said four learned laymen last week , is the doctors themselves-they keep their profession too exclusive . <P> The laymen were liberal arts deans , who had made a year 's study of preprofessional education . Their bombshell was exploded in the academic calm of the American Conference of Academic Deans at Cincinnati last week . The four-man committee proposed a resolution declaring : " Annually several thousand students fully qualified in training , personality and temperament are denied admission to the professional medical training of their choice . This set of conditions constitutes a most serious threat to the continued health and well-being of the American people . " <P> Before this tough language was deleted , Northwestern 's Dean Simeon E. Leland charged that the medical profession is governed by " Petrillo and Fishbein economics . " " Medicine , " said he , " is the only profession where the element of competition comes only at the beginning ... If we had more , we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical research and competition would weed out the weaker ones as it does in other professions . " <P> Ohio State 's young ( 37 ) , earnest Junior Dean William S. Guthrie quoted figures designed to show that there was a growing shortage of doctors . In 1905 and in 1949 , he said , the number of medical students in the U.S. was almost the same-though the population had all but doubled . Guthrie contended that the World War II speedup in medical colleges should be continued . <P> This , retorted the medical educators , was a fallacy : the wartime program , with its overcrowding and understaffing , had not given medical students the experience which they-and their future patients-deserved . <P> But many medical men were helping to prove their critics ' main point . While arguing that there was no shortage of doctors , they pointed proudly to long-range plans for increasing the output .
