But to get back to my lunch date with George Gerah  --  in : he said that he was glad to have somebody sing his songs the way he 'd written them . Com  --  posers do n't like to have people taking liberties with their stuff . If you do n't watch some singers , they trick up a melody with falsettos and all like that .

While I 'm at il , you may he inter-tasted in the difference between the way a big musical show was kicked off then and how its promoted today . To a man like Vinton Freedley , the whole present system of holding auditions for backers and selling off pieces of a show practically at auction is so embarrass  --  ing he ca n't go through with it . When it came to getting up Ihe scratch for a show , Vinton used his own money , for the most part . He 'd set aside part of the lake from his last . successful show and use it on his next one . He never let . more than three or four outsiders help him bank-roil . Two he did let in were Otto Kahn and New York City 's mayor , Jimmy Walker . Jimmy used to get up his share in cash .

Once , the bills fell out and drifted up and down the aisle like leaves fluttering in a front yard . Vinton had to grub around under the seats , picking up G-not es . Speaking of Jimmy Walker cues me into the story of the Central Park Ca  --  sino , for it was one of Jimmy 's favorite hangouts . After the opening night of Girl Crazy , I 'd gone to a party in the Casino . I 'd been there a few nights before and nobody had noticed me . But when I walked in that opening night . I saw people staring at me and whispering , and knew that I was in . I really knew I was in when the Ca  --  sino 's management asked me to come there and work every night after my Girl Crazy curtain .

That Casino was run beautifully . IL was the only place in America with only one show a night . All the rest had two or even I hree . There were al  --  ways fresh flowers on the tables . There was no nonsense , no lights , nobody get  --  ting too gassed and objectionable . I 'd started in Girl Crazy at $375 a week , eight , performances a week . Then Freedley raised me to $600 . But at the Casino I did one show a night  --  it lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes  --  and I was paid $1250 a week for it . As for the bite the income tax put on me in 1930 , we should have it so good now ! The crowd on hand for my Casino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Furness , the Earl of Warwick , Leslie Howard and Ethel Barrymore . And after I did my stuff they came over and shook my hand . My first number was a medley of hits ; there was a hot piano break and I went into " Delilah was a floozy . " A hot piano break is the spot where you do n't sing and the piano takes over solo for a few bars . Then there were more hot works from the band and I finished up with the fast , rah-rah-rah-type song , I Got Rhythm . I 've always finished with that . It 's my signature . I had my own special arrangements at the Casino . I 'd asked Roger Edens , who was playing piano in the pit in Girl Crazy , to make them for me . After that it seemed only natural to bring him to the Casino to play for me there too . I loved that Central Park Casino . When Roger Edens and I went there each night after the theater to do my show , we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the cur  --  tains to see what celebrities were on deck . Would it be Gertrude Lawrence , or . Jimmy Walker , or Lindbergh ? If they were there , or others like them , I 'd do a better show because they were . /53 Roger says I did n't , seem to realize that I was n star too . He says I was so impressed when Gestic Lawrence was out front that I was ga-ga . I guess I was still stage-struck , and seeing stars like Gertie Lawrence gave me a thrill . All I know is that I got more kick out of those people sitting ringside than I did out of doing the show . Imagine me getting paid to see those people ! Of course , I had to get out and sing a few songs , but that was no trouble . I did that in my shower for my own amuse  --  ment . My first engagement at the Casino was thirty weeks . After that I played there on and off until it closed . Behind me was Leo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Eddy Duchin'a piano playing was one of the big attractions of the band . His touch was a special thing  --  muted , smooth and wonderful . He was so good-looking that the girls stood around watching him , listening dreamy-passed , not bothering to dance , just making Little rhythmic movements hack and forth . Then , when Reisman left , Eddy took over with his own band . After Girl Crazy closed , I was hooked into the New York Paramount . By this time I 'd decided to use two pianists , so I engaged another one to work with Roger Edens . This second pianist was Johnny Green . Johnny 's now head of M-G-M 's musical organi  --  zation in Hollywood and is one of the great men in the musical business . Among other things , he wrote such hits as Body and Soul . So I was very lucky in the music department . In those days the theatrical season ended in June and shows shuttered for the summer . Girl Crazy did n't go on the road . In the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Scandals . The song-writer team of Lew Brown , Buddy De Sylva and Ray Henderson wrote the score . The show had opened in Atlantic City and opening night everyone knew it was a floppola . Lew Brown had writ  --  ten thirteen successful George White 's Scandals , and in his time he had tossed off as many consecutive hits as any Broadway writer . He was not only a great lyric writer , he was a fine comedy writer as well . But this time he 'd goofed . At least that was my opinion . Also , there was a shortage of person  --  alities . So Lou Irwin my agent , was asked to make a deal for me . It was agreed that new songs would be put in ? one of them was Life is Just a Bowl of Cherries  --  and I joined the cast . Since then , Cole Porter has told me more than once that he 's always been fascinated by the rhymes in that " cherries " song . The line , " Do n't take it serious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that rhyming " cherries " with " serious " and then with " mys  --  terious " " staggers the human mind . " Whether it made the human mind stagger or just weave and bob , Mr. White 's extravaganza ran seven months . / call it good staggering . George White was a nice man to work for , but I never really got to know him . I just knew him as a boss , the way I 'd known my second boss , Caleb Bragg . After the Scandals , I went for more vaudeville . That was in 1932 , and I was booked into the Palace on a sum  --  mer bill . Billy Gaston , Lou Holtz and I were the headliners . I finally had to leave to rehearse for a new stage mu  --  sical and Kate Smith took my place . A producer , Larry Schwab , had asked me to be in a musical called Humpty Dumpty . He had hired Dick ( ( . unt MICA on Page 92 ) ( 4 .011111111141 fvniu l'age 1111 ) Whiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs , and all hands were trying for " a dif  --  ferent approach to musical comedy . " The idea was to string Together a series of sketches that would kid the pilots off American history . But " different approach " or not , 1 he boys did n't have the right songs for Inc . Although that song-writing team was great when they were with it , the ones I hey had t hen struck me as being for two other girls . When I mentioned , in my shy and shrinking way , that / did n't think they had come up with any really great songs for me to belt out , a trouble  --  shooting conference was held . During the course of the conversation they asked my accompanist and arranger , Roger Edens , if he had any ideas . " As I remember it , Buddy De Sylva had an idea for a number I liked , " Roger said . " And all three of you had a tune for it , but it 's been shelved . It was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about Eadie having class with a capital K. " Eadie had been shelved because it was clear that Eadie bad been what my grandmother called a " soiled dove , " and Larry Schwab wanted to keep his show - on a high satirical plane . " But Roger Edens kept saying , " This ma  --  terial is automatically wonderful for Merman . " In the end he was told . " If you think it 's so wonderful and you think you can do something with it , go ahead and work on it . " Roger worked all night . By morning he had developed a sketch that was and is one of the greatest . Since then , Eadie , the girl with Klass , the dame who stuck her little finger out when she drank tea , has become a part of our na  --  tional song life , along with a frail named Frankie , who had " a man who done her wrong , " and a doll named Jennie , who " had a heart as big as a whale . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what she could n't do . It was sung by a broad  --  who was never going to he mistaken for the headmistress of a seminary  --  to the blondes who were flouncing around the house after Eadie 's funeral , busily re  --  membering how ladylike Eadie had been . I was the brassy biddy who sang the song . When Roger added some lyrics of his own and played the whole thing over for me , I liked it a lot . Then he played it for Buddy De Sylva , and Buddy liked it too . But as I recall it , Larry Schwab teal said he did n't think it was in a class with t he rest of the ma  --  terial . " It 's in a class with me , " I said . " I want to do it . " Things were getting tough . We only had two weeks left before opening , so the others said , " Let 's let Roger go ahead with it . " And Larry was a sport . He went along too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls could sit and mourn . The costume designer designed costumes that were a combination of funeral decorum and the mad , had life . Then , zongo ! Humpty Dumpty opened in Pittsburgh . Not to put too fine a point upon it , it stunk up the joint . In Junior League words , it was a fiasco . Nothing went over except Eadie . The arty sketches were nothing . All those little satirical vignettes of American history just lay there while Eadie went on to glory . The next day one Pittsburgh paper did n't even call the show Humpty Dumpty . Its re  --  viewer said , " Eadie Was a Lady opened last night . " 80 it was decided to close the show and begin all over again . Plenty of re-writ ing was done , and when we hit the road for another tryout , the show 's leading comedian was Jack Haley . The only songs salvaged were Eadie and aloof her sing , You 're an Old Smoothie . Some of the Betty Co-Eds and Joe Colleges of that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new songs , and the produc  --  tion was retitled Take a Chance . Soinetinnee rewriting , tinkering and revamping works , sometimes it does n't , but Take a Chance was a smash hit . The biggest thrill Roger Edens ever had was when The New York Times printed the lyrics of Eadie ? in full  --  the week of the New York opening . The New York Times yet ! Roger al  --  most burst with pride . On the strength of this , he was given a chance to go to Hollywood , where he later worked on Kid Millions , a movie I made with Ed  --  die Cantor for Sam Goldwyn . When Take a Chance finished its New York run , it was taken to Chicago and r went with it . But there just was n't the excitement there is in tieing in a show in New York in wintertime . There was none of that crispness in the air that goes with football or a Broad  --  way fall opening . A fall night in New York , with the fur coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black ties and Chesterfields , makes your insides tingle as well as your skin . My next was Anything Goes . In it was my personal nomination for the finest comedy team who ever worked , Billy Gaxton and Victor Moore . The story of how Anything Goes reached the boards was as crazy as any of the stories the musical shows of those days were built around and t hey were real crazy . Vinton Freedley had an associ  --  ate named Alex Aarons . Aarons is dead now , but at that point he was obsessed by the idea that it would Is ' wonderful to have the British matinee idol and song-and-dance man , Jack Buchanan , in a show for him . Vinton thought it would he fine , too , if he could have an intimeie-review-type thing I iui I t emu nd Buchanan , otherwise not . Buchanan had scored a resounding success in such productions . But " otherwise " was the kind of show Aarons had in mind , so Vinton decided to take a powder . " You 'd hatter do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I ' ll sit it out . " In addition to Buchanan , whom he 'd hired at $3000 a week , Aarona had Jack Pearl , who was then at the height of his Baron Munchausen radio fame , and Lyda Roberti . He 'd also signed Morrie Ryskind , who had written the hook for Of Thee I Sing , and he 'd lined up Herbie Fields , George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin . Aarons did things in a big way , only in this case he was do  --  ing them with small money . He was financially committed up to his eye  --  balls . but he had few nickels in his pants . As Vinton tells it , one morning Alex came to him looking pea-green , and said , " I 'm in a jam . I 've made an eight-week guarantee for Buchanan . That 's twenty-four thousand , and I 've made a six-week guarantee for Roherti . That 's six thousand more . And I have no do-re-mi . " " I 'll take over , " Vinton told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " The show was called Pardon My English It was a question whether Vinton was taking over the show or Lhe show was taking over Vinton . It cost $90,000 , very heavy sugar for those days . Pardon My English ran for ten weeks at the Majestic Theater  --  and lost $5000 a week . Then Vinton 's cred  --  itors closed in on him with menacing motions , and Vinton closed the show , He told his wife , " We 'll go someplace and hide until I can catch up . " He took his wife to Panama on a fruit boat , en route to Tobago , an island north of Trinidad , and when he quit panting , they holed up there . They spent four or five months while Vinton put , splints on his bank loan and band  --  aged it . When he paid off his creditors he came home . While he was on Tobago he 'd hired a little boat and done some fishing while he tried to think of a story around which to build his next show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his comeback production and he wanted me again . He hoped to do something with music by Cole Porter . Vinton had always worked with George Gershwin , but with Porgy and Bess , Gershwin had gone operatic , and he was n't interested in just writing a straight musical-show score at the mo  --  ment . So , having been a guy on a boat him  --  self for a while , Vinton quite naturally thought of a story about a guy on a boat  --  or rather , two guys and a gal on a boat . He came back from Tobago , got hold of me and outlined the story he had in mind . It sounded great . Like all musical-comedy stories of that era , the story was nothing to make Shakespeare twirl in his grave . It was about a fellow ( Billy Gaxton ) who went to see a night-club girl fine ) off on a boat . His boss had given him some important papers to deliver , but be  --  cause he was messing around with me , the ship sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Enemy No. 13 Victor Moores disguised as a minister . From then on , it was up to the plot to take care of itself . Among other things , there was a revival meeting on ship  --  board , and Billy and Victor played strip-tease with two Chinese . The Chi  --  nese won . Assembling the ingredients was quite a problem . When Vinton finally got in touch with Cole Porter , he found him floating down the Rhine in a boat , As writers , Freedley wanted Guy Bolton and P. G. Wodehouse , but Bolton ? who had written Sally ; and Rosalie and Lady be Good with col  --  laborators  --  was in England , and Bol  --  ton 's writing partner , Wodehouse , was rusticating in France . To line those two up , Vinton hoarded the Majestic and headed for Europe . He scooped up Bol  --  ton and took him to Le Touquet in France , where Wodehouse was living ; then , having got them together , Vinton sketched out the story he had in mind . They said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it by cross-Channel telephone and mail their script to the U. S. A. The script finally arrived on August fifteenth . Vinton had hired Howard Lindsay to direct the show , so he I urned the script over to him , It was called Hard to Get and it was laid on a ship all right  --  a ship that sank . Vin  --  t on 's reaction to that was an agonized : " This is funny ? " A few days later the S. S. Morro Cas  --  tle burned off Asbury Park , with a loss of 134 lives . That did it . If there ever had been anything funny about a sink  --  ing ship , there was nothing funny about it now . " We 're in trouble , " Vinton told Howard Lindsay . It was the under  --  statement of the year . Howard agreed . " You 're going to have to revise it , " Vinton said , But Howard did n't agree on that .

" Vinton asked Cole Porter if he knew of a good playwright 's assistant , and Cole said , " No . " But that night Cole ran into an old friend , magazine-cover artist Neysa McMein , al n party . At 8 A.M. the nod day Neysa called Cole . " I dreamed about a man for you , " she said . " His name is Russel Crouse . " " What is a Russel Crouse ? " Cole asked . Cryptic , that Porter , especially when roused at eight in t he morning , " This Rum &; Crouse is a press agent for the Theatre Guild , " Neysa said , " Has he ever written anything be  --  fore ? " Cole asked . " Just press releases , " Neysa said . It did n't seem too promising , but some of Neysa 's dreams had paid off , so Cole called Vinton . " Where do I find this Crouse ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street from your office . Just wave at him , " Cole said . " You 've probably been looking at him for ten years . " Vinton called Crouse ? whose nick  --  name is Buck ? and said , " Will you come over and meet . a fellow called Howard Lindsay ? " " I 'd like to meet a fellow named Howard Lindsay , " Buck Crouse said , and that 's how the firm of Lindsay and Crouse began . If it . had n't been for Neysa 's dream , there would have been no Life With Father , no Arsenic and Old Lace , no State of the Union , no Call Me Madam . It would have been a loss . Howard and Buck began to revise , but the lime was so short that we went . into rehearsal with one small scene in a bar of a ship . There was still a ship the story , but this one did n't sink . Vinton had to order scenery for the other scenes , so he told Don Goen  --  slager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of interior with an ex  --  terior feeling .

So , after leaving the girl up on deck , he entered the stateroom with his trousers draped casually over his arm and said , " What a night , what a dawn , what a sunrise ! " I looked at Lindsay and Crouse . They looked as if they wanted to hide under the Plymouth Rock , and I thought , Well , here we are , closed in Boston the first night .
