You might as well know now . . . we 've done a lot of checking up on you . I can tell you your life story from Georgia to where you are sitting now . It may be that you will be the first Negro in organized baseball . 243 JACKIE CLOSEUP He is flabbergasted and , at the same time , beginning to feel an excitement which he can not well hide .

The razzing. . . the cruel , unfair razzing that every player gets , and the special razzing , the special name-calling you 're going to get . Can you stand it ? 259 JACKIE CLOSEUP He nods . 260 RICKEY CLOSEUP &nbsp; RICKEYAre you sure ? Because . . . ( face grim ) You 're not going to be able to fight back . . . no matter what the offense.

Finally it comes . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . to fight back ?  --  78  --  262 RICKEY CLOSEUP It 's a poser . He rubs his face , his chin , and practically his entire head . Eventually he finds an answer . &nbsp; RICKEYThat 's what 's going to make your job so tough . No ! I want a fighter every time . I want a man in there for everything he 's got ! But . . . you 'll have to take it . . . not fight back . . . and yet , do it so that somehow it 's no discredit to you . . . so that somehow the crowd will sense it 's not cowardice that is stopping you but something deeper . If , and when , you can put that over . . . your troubles are over . No player will bother you , no man will unfairly attack you by name or epithet , when you have established that with the baseball public . Because the very core of Americans is fair play . . . once they have felt the true situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Jackie follows . &nbsp; RICKEYJackie , I know from your background that you 've been spiked and beaned in baseball , you 've been clipped and two-way tackled in football , you 've been banged around on the street . That 's what you face now . And you do n't dare yell copper . . . or fight back . You do n't dare because more than you . . . much more than just you . . . hangs in the balance .

Finally , the pitcher begins his windup and immediately Jackie is off for third . With the yell from the crowd the pitcher stops in mid-windup to make a quick throw to third again .

COMMITTEE ROOM - ( STOCK ) We show those scenes of Jackie in which he is beginning the selected excerpts given below .  --  130  --  &nbsp; JACKIEYou can put me down as an expert on being a colored American , with thirty years of experience at it . And just like any other colored person with sense enough to look around him and understand what he sees , I know that life in these United States can be mighty tough for people who are a little different from the majority  --  in their skin , color or the way they worship their God , or the way they spell their names . I 'm not fooled because I 've had a chance open to very few Negro Americans . It 's true that I 've been the laboratory specimen in a great change in organized baseball . I 'm proud that I 've made good on my assignment to the point where other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to the top . But I 'm very well aware that even this limited job is n't finished . As I see it there has been a terrific lot of misunderstanding on this subject of communism among Negroes in this country , and it 's bound to hurt my people 's cause unless it 's cleared up . I understand that there are some few Negroes who are members of the Communist party , and in event of war with Russia they would probably act just as any other Communists would . So would members of other minority and majority groups . . . . Most Negroes  --  and Italians and Irish and Jews and Swedes and Slavs and other Americans  --  would act just as all these groups did in the last war . They 'd do their best to help their country stay out of war ; if unsuccessful , they 'd do their best to help their country win the war  --  against Russia or any other enemy that threatened us. . .  --  131  --  I ca n't speak for any fifteen million people any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that I 've got too much invested for my wife and child and myself in the future of this country , and I and other Americans of many races and faiths have too much invested in our country 's welfare , for any of us to throw it away . I am a religious man . Therefore , I cherish America where I am free to worship as I please , a privilege which some countries do not give . And I suspect that 999 out of almost any 1,000 colored Americans you meet will tell you the same thing . But that does n't mean that we 're going to stop fighting race discrimination in this country until we 've got it licked . It means that we 're going to fight it all the harder because our stake in the future is so big . We can win our fight without the Communists and we do n't want their help . . . .
