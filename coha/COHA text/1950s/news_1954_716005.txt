txt President Eisenhower submitted to Congress today a program ' ' to improve the health of the Amer. ican people . " In a special message , the President urged the creation of a $25,000,000 fund to establish " a limited Federal reinsurance service to encourage private and nonprofit health insurance organizations to offer broader health protection to more families . " In addition , the President rec. ommended : ( More aid to the states and localities to improve their health and welfare services , for building hospitals for the chronically sick and an expansion of the program to provide for construction of nonprofit clinics , nursing and convalescent homes . ( An extended ' program of rehabilitation for the disabled . ( Strengthening of the Public Health Service research activities . Simplifyifig the " patchwork of complex formulas " for Federal grants ' for health , child welfare and other programs . " While continuing to reject Government regimentation of medicine , we shall with vigor , and imagination continuously , search out by appropriate meank recommend , and put into effect new methods of achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President said . ' Essence of Our Vitality ' " We shall not relax in the struggle against disease , " he added , " The health of our people is the very essence of our vitality , our strength and our progress as a nation . " The President 's use of such terms as " regimentation " and " rejecting the socialization of medicine " were considered gibes at former President Truman 's proposals for national or state systems of compulsory health insurance . These were fought by the American Medical Association . A. spokesman for the A , M. A. said the association was not prepared to comment today on Pres. ident Eisenhower 's message , The United Press reported that in Los Angeles Dr. Ed. ward Jr McCormick of Toledo , Ohio , president of the A. M. A. , said Monday in comment on the President 's health reinsurance proposal that private companies could handle the problem " if they are let alone . ' " He agreed that $25,000,000 was not a large amount but said that in a few years it might be couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of business. / Under the Eisenhower pro . gram , the Government would make reinsurance available to private and nonprofit health insurance plans . The people could subscribe to these plans or not , as they wished . The President said the pro . posed service " would reinsure the special additional risks involved in such broader protection , " and could " be launched with a capital fund of $25,000 , . 000 ? * * to be retired from reinsurance fees . " Additional Details Lacking No additional details on the reinsurance service were available immediately , There was speculation that the President might want health plans carrying Government reinsurance to graduate their fees to put medical and health insurance within the reach of the lower-income groups . This possibility was seen in a bill with such a proviso sponsored by Representative Charles A , Wolverton , Republican of New Jersey and chairman of the House Commerce Committee . Mr. Wel. verton termed the President ' message " most timely and most noteworthy . " Representative Wolverton later introduced the first of a series of Administration bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The authori- // zations would include $20,000,000 a year for building diagnostic centers , $10,000,000 a year for building nursing homes , and $20 , - 000,0004. year for nonprofit hospitals for the chronically ill and impaired . The funds would be made available on a contributory basis ' similar to that in the program of Federal aid for hospital construction . The reception of the message in Congress was generally favorable . Senator William A. Purtell , Republican of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate Labor and Public Welfare subcommittee on health legislation , said the President 's outline of a national health . program provided " a fine , realistic approach " to the problem He said his group would start hearings by late February . Senator Herbert H. Lehman , Democrat of New York , who was chairman of the Senate Health subcornmitte in the Eighty-Second ' Congress , said the President 's message " is all right as far as it goes . " " The trouble is that it does not go far enough , and is certainly vague in some vital . aspects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is no mention of the need to help states establish local public health units or for the need for Federal funds to expand facilities for medical education , " Mr : Lehman declared . Representative Charles A. Halleek of Indiana , Republican Leader of the House of Representatives , said " the President puts his finger on key problems and recommends avenues of action which preserve the fundamentals of a system which has already brought us results envied by the rest of the world . " Representative John W. McCormack of Massachusetts , the Democratic Whip , said the message was " a progressive one ? splendid : " ? Sees Much to Be Done The President noted that rapid progress had been made in the last ? half century toward better health but that much remained to be:done . For example , he said that 224,000 . Americans died of cancer last year . The nation had the knowledge and skill : to reduce ' these and other mortality figures but this knowledge and skill were not always available to all the people where and when needed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on : the distribution of medical facilities and the costs of medical care . The President said there were 159 practicing physicians for every 100,000 of the civilian population in the Northeast United States , contrasted with 126 physicians in the West , 116 in the South Central area , and 92 in the South . There were four or five hospital beds for each 1,000 people in some states , compared with ten or eleven in others . One of the goals of his plan , the President said , is to make the means for achieving good health accessible to all . To meet the cost problem , the President listed first the encouragement of voluntary health insurance plans . Then he proposed a new approach to grants-in-aid to the states . He said that under the present " patchwork " system grants were restricted to specified purposes , so that states often had too much money for some programs and not enough for others . Higher Goal h Set Under the approach recommended by the President , Federal support of a grants-in-aid program would be based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion to their need , in proportion to their population , and part of the Federal assistance would be " set aside for the support of unique projects of regional or national significance which give promise of new and better ways of serving the hu . man needs of our citizens . " The President set a higher goal for rehabilitation of the disabled . He said that 60,000 disabled individuals were returned each year to full and productive lives , whereas 250,000 persons were disabled annually . His Budget Message on Thursday , he said , will reflect his objectives on this point , and he ' added " we must extend greater assistance to the states . " He said there was a need for ' at least 500,000 more hospital beds , but that hospital construction met only part of the urgent need for medical facilities . Cer- ' tain nonacute illness conditions can be handled , for example , in facilities that are less elaborate and less costly to operate than tha general hospital , the President asserted . He suggested amendments to the Hospital Survey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
