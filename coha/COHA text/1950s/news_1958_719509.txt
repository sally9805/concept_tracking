txt Dr , Bernard Schwartz , New York University lawyer who has stepped on some highly placed toes , was continued for the time being in his job of counsel to a House subcommittee investigating federal regulatory agericies . But the subcommittee vote on a motion to dismiss Dr. Schwartz reportedly was 6-5 , and there was a question whether this margin would stand up long , ? The congressional investigation into the Federal Communications Commission appears too hot to handle . That is the inference being drawn from the move to dismiss the House subcommittee investigator , Dr. Bernard Schwartz , just as he was about to probe into alleged improper pressures on the FCC from officials in the White House and the Cabinet .. Dr. Schwartz has been told that he is to be dismissed . This is taken to mean that the whole investigation may be swept under the rug . There have been indications from the first that all five Republicans on the subcommittee together with several Democrats were opposed to the investigation . Dr. Schwartz obviously under the impression that an investigation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that officials in the White House had influenced decisions in the granting of TV licenses . ' High Officials Named He had planned to " hold hearings on the role of Sherman Adams , Sinclair Weeks , Robert Murray ( former Undersecretary of Commerce ) and Col. George Gordon Moore ( brother-in-law of Mrs. Eisenhower ) in connection with the FCC and other agencies . One case involved the granting of a television license to the Boston Herald and Traveler after FCC examiner James Cunningham had recommended against it and for its issuance to a group of independent businessmen instead . Dr. Schwartz had planned to send staff investigators to Boston to look into the case . The current phase of the inquiry has dealt with the conduct of FCC commissioners in accepting favors from the industry . It was apparently an opener for the broader probe . Dr. Schwartz has been under almost constant attack by members of the House subcommittee for his vigorous conduct of the inquiry . He is a law professor at New York University , holds five degrees , has written seven books , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , the New York lawyer , who has been quizzing John C. Doerfer , FCC commissioner , on the subject of travel vouchers in possible duplication of expenses already paid by the industry ? is himself being queried about the propriety of a $400.73 travel voucher submitted to the subcommittee last August . The lawyer sees this as an attempt to smear him , promoted by " powerful interests " who will " stop at nothing . " Asked why the subcommittee was contemplating his dismissal , Dr. Schwartz replied : , " One of the things we were going into was White House influence in the agencies . My plan was to pull together all information on White House influence in our files . . . I planned to hold a series of big hearings on this in about a month . " The FCC hearings were forced into the open when a secret report regarding the activities of FCC commissioners was " leaked " to the press . It now develops that the report was " leaked " by Dr. Schwartz himself to the New York Times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the committee were put under oath , in the effort to find where the leak occurred . Dr. Schwartz defends his action , saying he did so only after inaccurate reports about the FCC probe had been printed by columnist Drew Pearson . No one has admitted having made this information available to Mr. Pearson . jCongressmen Wary Investigation of the FCC is part of a $230,000 probe of all the regulatory agencies in an effort to determine whether they are performing their function in accordance with the law . Behind the present situation in the FCC is the tremendous development of television within the past five years or more . Millions of dollars are involved in the growth of this new giant in the communications field and pressures are undoubtedly in proportion . It was perhaps na ? ve of Dr. Schwartz to believe that Congress would back him in such serious charges involving high White House and administration officials , particularly when many members of Congress own television stations , or have a part interest in them .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
