With military precision and the help of expanded studies in the humanities , U.S. service academies this year plucked a prize bag of Rhodes scholarships . The impetus : a sharp new drive at West Point and the Air Academy* to plunge bright graduates into the heady whirl of Britain 's ancient Oxford University . The Air Academy won its first scholarship , and there were a record five for West Pointt ( matched only by Harvard ) . Recalls one awed civilian competitor , who stepped into the exam ring with them : " They looked like tall glasses of cold milk . " <P> Last week the six winners looked more like close-cropped Spartans cut loose in Athens . Donning black robes and boarding bicycles , they found Oxford a startling experience . They met their tutors , pondered invitations to join the Zen Buddhist club , learned where to sneak in after college gates close at midnight . The headiest shock was Oxford 's enfolding leisure . Suddenly there was time to talk all night , to sleep until noon . " Back there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 , " I barely had time to read a book a week . " Muttered another unbound lieutenant : " I keep thinking I ought to be doing something every second . " <P> <P> Scope &; Depth . Everywhere lay temptations to loaf for the next two years , forget that the Oxford tour ends with a do-or-die final examination . Officially on active duty , military Rhodesmen draw full lieutenant 's pay as well as the $2,100 annual Rhodes stipend . Attached to the U.S. embassy in London , they get cut-rate PX privileges . They can dress in well-groomed contrast to their colleagues ; they can buy cars and hi-fi sets , live in tonier style than all but the richest bloods of wealthy Christ Church College . " You chaps , " said an envious Briton , " are the heirs to Edwardian Oxford . " <P> The military students seem less Edwardian than determined . Air Academy-man Hosmer ( No. 1 in his class ) is backed by West Pointers Jim Ray ( No. 2 in his class ) , Stan Karanowski ( No. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gillette ( No. 23 ) and Pete Dawkins ( No. 10 ) , West Point 's celebrated Ail-American halfback and first captain of cadets . Dawkins will play Rugby only for his intramural Brasenose College team ( " not with a splash , but gradually " ) . Hosmer will do some wistful spare-time flying ( " All my classmates are in pilot training " ) . The real job is Oxford 's challenging labor : the independent pursuit of " fineness of mind . " All are reading " P.P.E. " ( **29;17095;TOOLONG ) , a stiff course enthusiastically approved by the U.S. military . " This is an ideal opportunity , " says Pete Dawkins . " At West Point , we achieved a certain scope in our education . What we need now is depth . " <P>
