The great promise of the atomic age-cheap and unlimited power from uranium - has not materialized . Some critics blame the Atomic Energy Commission for yielding to the military and devoting too much of its attention to developing atomic weapons . Speaking last week before the Detroit Section of the Society of Automotive Engineers , Dr. Lawrence R. Hafstad , director of the AEC 's Division of Reactor Development , answered the critics . If practical atomic power ever comes , said Dr. Hafstad , it will probably be because of , not in spite of , military needs . <P> It is well established , Dr. Hafstad admitted , that the earth contains a lot of uranium and that uranium contains a lot of energy . Theoretically , one pound of fissionable uranium could do the work of 360,000 gallons of gasoline . But no one should be led astray by such figures , Dr. Hafstad warned . Getting practical and tractable energy out of uranium is an extremely difficult , dangerous and expensive business . <P> Elusive Materials . In designing nuclear reactors , Hafstad said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of them are useless . They absorb too many neutrons ( and so slow down the reaction ) or they are quickly damaged by corrosion , heat or radiation . The AEC is building a special reactor to test the performance of various materials for piping , shielding , etc . Until it has been in operation for some time , reactor designers will not know for certain what materials they dare to use . <P> Hafstad regretted that he could not give his audience the latest figures on the cost and efficiency of reactors . Keeping on the safe side of security , he estimated that four large research reactors cost $2,688 for every kilowatt of power they produce , while a coal-burning power plant , he pointed out , costs $133 a kilowatt . Nuclear reactors will have to improve enormously before they can compete economically with conventional power producers . At present they are so far behind that a private company would be crazy to put any money into them . <P> Dividends of War . The saving factor , said Hafstad , is the much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war , which transcend economics , may yet make nuclear energy available for peaceful purposes . " In fact , " said Hafstad , " the history of technological development is replete with examples of civilian devices the development costs of which were borne by the military . Take such a lowly item as an aluminum saucepan . How long would it have taken to collect from housewives in dimes and quarters , the millions of dollars that have gone into the wartime study of the metallurgy and fabrication problems of aluminum ? Or take airplanes themselves . Would the Post Office Department , for example , have been able to find the hundreds of millions of dollars for the development costs of a device as visionary as the airplane ? " Hafstad pointed out that the submarine has proved wholly useless for all but war like purposes . But the lightweight diesel engine now dominating U.S. railroads was developed for use in submarines . The present furious research on reactors for propelling naval vessels or even the work on the wholly " useless " atomic bomb may yield similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
