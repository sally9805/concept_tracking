Part III , Conelutling a Novel by ALDOUS HUXLEY THE GENIUS AND THE GODDESS Drawings by Leo Manso This is the story of Dr. Henry Maartens , brilliant scientist and Nobel Prize winner , and of his family  --  especially his beautiful wife , Katy , and Dr. Maartens ' prudish young assistant , John Rivers , who lived with them , and who now , thirty years later , relates the story to the novelist . There are minor tensions ; the young daughter , Ruth , who fancies herself a poet , also fancies herself in love with Rivers . But the dynamics of the situation lie in the obsessive love which the scientist and his wife have for each other . Because Katy is called to Chicago to take care of her dying mother , Dr. Maartens becomes dangerously ill with pneumonia and his wife is forced to return home to nurse him . The double strain is too much for her and she turns to the young man , who loves her with what he describes as an almost religious passion . He becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions . The story resumes as the guilty Rivers comes down to breakfast the morning after he has first made love to Katy . III I N THE HALL , on my way to the dining room , I ran into Beulah . She was carrying a tray with the eggs and bacon , and humming the tune of ' All creatures that on earth do dwell ' ; catching sight of me , she gave me a radiant smile and said , ' Praise the Lord ! ' I had never felt less inclined to praise Him . ' We 're going to have a miracle , ' she went on . And when I asked her how she knew we were going to have a miracle , Copyright 1955 by Aldous Huxley she told me that she had just seen Mrs. Maartens in the sickroom , and Mrs. Maartens was herself again . Not a ghost any more , but her old self . The virtue had come hack , and that meant that Dr. Maartens would start getting well again . ' It 's Grace , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and day . " Dear Lord , give Mrs. Maartens some of that Grace of Yours . Let her have the virtue back , so Dr. Maartens can get well . " And now it 's happened , it 's happened ! ' " And , as though to confirm what she had said , there was a rustling on the stairs behind us . We turned . It was Katy . She was dressed in black . Love and sleep had smoothed her face , and the body which yesterday had moved so wearily , at the cost of so much painful effort , was now as softly strong , as rich with life as it had been before her mother 's illness . She was a goddess once again  --  in mourning but uneclipsed , luminous even in her grief and resignation . The goddess came down the stairs , said good morning , and asked if Beulah had told me the bad news . For a moment I thought something must have happened to IIenry . ' You mean Dr. Maartens ? ' I began . She cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And suddenly I realized that , officially , I had n't yet heard of the melancholy event in Chicago . The blood rushed up into my cheeks and I turned away in horrible confusion . We were acting the lie already  --  and was I bad at it Sadly but serenely , the goddess went on talking about that midnight telephone call , about her sister 's voice sobbing at the other end of the wire , about the last moments of the long-drawn agony . " Beulah sighed noisily , said it was God 's will and that she had known it all along , then changed the subject . ' What about Dr. Maartens ? ' she asked . Had they taken his temperature ? Katy nodded ; they had , and it was definitely lower . ' Did n't I tell you sot ' the old woman said to me triumphantly . ' It 's the grace of God , just like I said . The Lord has given her back the virtue . ' We moved into the dining room , sat down and began to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , that I found the heartiness rather shocking . " Rivers laughed . " How hard it is not to be a Manichee ! Soul 's high , body 's low . Death 's an affair of the soul , and in that context eggs and bacon are in bad taste , and love , of course , is sheer blasphemy . And yet it 's sufficiently obvious that eggs and bacon may be the means of grace , that love may be chosen as the instrument of divine intervention . " " You 're talking like Beulah , " I objected . " Because there are n't any other words to talk with . The uprush from within of something strong and wonderful , something that 's manifestly greater than yourself ; the things and events which , from being neutral or downright hostile , suddenly , gratuitously , spontaneously come to your rescue  --  these are facts . They can he observed , they can be experienced . But if you want to talk about them , you discover that the only vocabulary is the theologian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words protest too much , beg all the questions before they 're asked . But there are occasions when you ca n't avoid them . " Here was Katy , for example . When she came back from Chicago , the virtue had gone out of her . Gone out of her so completely that she was useless to Henry and a burden to herself . Another woman might have prayed for strength , and the prayer might have been answered  --  because prayers do get answered sometimes . Which is absurd , which is out of the question ; and yet it happens . Not , however , to people like Katy . Katy was n't the praying kind . For her , the supernatural was Nature ; the divine was neither spiritual nor specifically human ; it was in landscapes and sunshine and animals ; it was in flowers , in the sour smell of little babies , in the warmth and softness of snuggling children ; it was in kisses , of course , in the nocturnal apocalypses of love , in the more diffuse but no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of feminine Antaeus  --  invincible while her feet were on the ground , a goddess so long as she was in contact with the greater goddess within her , the universal Mother without . Three weeks of attendance on a dying woman had broken that contact . Grace came when it was restored , and that happened on the night of April the twenty-third . An hour of love , five or six hours of the deeper otherness of sleep , and the emptiness was filled , the ghost reincarnated . She lived again  --  yet not she , of course , but the Unknown Quantity lived in her . The Unknown Quantity , " he repeated . " At one end of the spectrum it 's pure spirit , it 's the Clear Light of the Void ; and at the other end it 's instinct , it 's health , it 's the perfect functioning of an organism that 's infallible so long as we do n't interfere with it ; and somewhere between the two extremes is what St. Paul called ' Christ ' ? the divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace  --  three aspects of the same underlying mystery , ideally , all of us should be open to all of them . In practice most of us either barricade ourselves against every form of ' grace or , if we open the door , open it to only one of the forms . Which is n't , of course , enough . And yet a third of a loaf is better than no bread . How much better was manifest that morning of April twenty-fourth . Cut off Irony animal grace , Katy had been an impotent phantom . Restored to it , she was Hera and Demeter and Aphrodite gloriously rolled into one , with Aesculapius and the Grotto of Lourdes thrown in as a bonus  --  for the miracle was definitely under way . After three days at death 's door , Henry had felt the presence of the virtue in her and was responding . Lazarus was in process of being raised . " " Thanks , at one remove , to you !

" 0 BE T T ER than any other subject . .1 Oedipus , for example , or Lear , or even Jesus or Gandhi  --  you could make a roaring farce out of any of them . It 's just a question of describing your characters from the outside , without sympathy , and in violent but unpuetical language . In real life farce exists only for spectators , never for the actors . What they participate in is either a tragedy or a complicated and more or less painful psychological drama . So far as I was concerned , the farce of the cuckold 's miraculous healing was a long-drawn anguish of divided loyalties , of love in conflict with duty , of temptations resisted and then ignominiously succumbed to , of pleasures guiltily enjoyed and passionately repented , of good resolutions made , forgotten , made again , and once more swept away by the torrent of irresistible desire . " " I thought you 'd made up your mind to go away . " " I had . But that was before I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A goddess in mourning . Those emblems of bereavement kept alive the pity , the religious adoration , the sense that my beloved was a spirit who must be worshiped in spirit . But out of the black bodice rose the luminous column of the neck ; between the coils of honey-colored hair the face was transfigured by a kind of unearthly radiance . What 's that thing of Blake 's ? In a wife I would require What in whores is always found , The lineaments of gratified desire . " But the lineaments of gratified desire are also the lineaments of desirability , the lineaments of the promise of future satisfactions . God , how frantically I desired herl And how passionately , from the depths of my remorse , the heights of my idealism , I loathed myself for doing so ! When I got back from the lab , I tried to stave it out with her . But she put me off . It was n't the time , it was n't the place . Beulah might come in , or Nurse Koppers . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet . And so that evening she came to my room . In the darkness , in the perfumed field of her womanhood , I tried to tell her all the things I had been unable to tell her that morning  --  that I loved her , but we must n't ; that I had never been so happy , nor so utterly miserable ; that I would remember what had happened with the most passionate gratitude , all my life long , and that tomorrow I would pack my bags and go and never , never see her again . At that point my voice broke and I found myself sobbing . This time it was Katy 's turn to say , ' Do n't cry , ' to offer the consolation of a baud on the shoulder , an encircling arm . The outcome , of course , was the same as it had been the night before . The same but more so  --  with fierier pentecosts , visitations not from mere angels , but from Thrones , Dominations , Powers , and the next morning ( when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags ) , remorses to match the ecstasies , woodpeckers proportionately ferocious . " " Which Katy , I gather , wasn't. pecked by ? " " And absolutely refused to talk about , " Rivers added . " But you must have talked about them . " " I did my best . But it takes two to make a conversation . Whenever 1 tried to tell her something of what was going on in my heart and mind , she either changed the subject or else , with a little laugh , with a little indulgent pat on the back of the hand , gently but very decidedly shut me up . Would it have been better , I wonder , if we had come out into the open , courageously called a spade a phallic symbol and handed one another our quivering entrails on a silver platter ? Maybe it would . Or maybe it would n't . The truth shall make you free ; but on the other hand , let sleeping dogs lie and , above all , let lying dogs sleep . One must never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things ; they 're the wars about the nonsense that eloquent idealists have talked about things  --  in other words , the religious wars . What 's lemonade ? Something you make out of lemons . And what 's a crusade ? Something you make out of crosses  --  a course of gratuitous violence motivated by an obsession with unanalyzed symbols . What do you read , my lord ? ' ' Words , words , words . ' And what 's in a word ? Answer ; corpses , millions of corpses . And the moral of that is , Keep your trap shut ; or if you mast open it , never take what comes out of it too seriously . Katy kept our traps firmly shut . She had the instinctive wisdom that taboos the four-letter words ( and a fortiori the scientific polysyllables ) , while tacitly taking for granted the daily and nightly four-letter acts to which they refer . In silence , an act is an act is an act . Verbalized and discussed , it becomes an ethical problem , a casus belli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had talked , where , I ask you , should we have been ? In a labyrinth of interconimunieating guilts and anguishes . Some people , of course , enjoy that sort of thing . Others detest it , but feel , remorsefully , that they deserve to suffer . Katy ( God bless her ! ) was neither a . Methodist nor a Masochist . She was a goddess and the silence of goddesses is genuinely golden . None of your superficial plating , A solid , twenty-two-carat silence all the way through . The Olympian 's trap is kept shut , not by an act of willed discretion , but because there 's really nothing to say . Goddesses are all of one piece . There 's no internal conflict in them . Whereas the lives of people like you and me are one long argument . Desires on one side , woodpeckers on the other . Never a moment of real silence . " What I needed most at that time was a dose of justificatory good language to counteract the effect of all that vile-base-foul . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , language was entirely beside the point . The point , so far as she was concerned , was her experience of the creative otherness of love and sleep . The point was finding herself once again in a state of grace . The point , Finally , was her renewed ability to do something for Henry . The proof of the pudding is in the eating , not in the cookbook , Pleasure received and given , virtue restored . Lazarus raised from the dead  --  the eating in this case was sell-evidently good . So help yourself to the pudding and do n't talk with your mouth full  --  it 's bad manners and it prevents you from appreciating the ambrosial flavor . It was a piece of advice too good for me to he able to take . " True , I did n't talk to her she would n't let me . But I ' went on talking to myself  --  talking and talking till the ambrosia turned into wormwood or was contaminated by the horrible gamy taste of forbidden pleasure , of sin recognized and knowingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Steadily , rapidly , without a single setback , Henry was getting better . " " Did n't that make you feel happier about things ? " I asked . Rivers nodded his head . In one way , yes . Because , of course , I realized even then , even in my state of imbecile innocence , that I was indirectly responsible for the miracle . I had betrayed my master ; but if I had n't , my master would probably be dead . Evil had been done ; but good , an enormous good , had conic of it . It was a kind of justification . On the other hand how horrible it seemed that grace for Katy and life for her husband should be dependent on something so intrinsically low , so utterly vilebase-foul , as bodies and their sexual satisfaction . All my idealism revolted against the notion . And yet it was obviously true . " " AND HENRY ? " I asked . " How much did he know or suspect about the origins of the miracle ? " " Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . He was in a mood , as he emerged from the sepulcher , in which suspicion was unthinkabie . ' Rivers , ' he said to me one day when he was well enough to have me come and read to him , ' I want to talk to you . About Katy , ' he added after a little pause . My heart stopped beating . This was the moment I had dreaded . ' You remember that night just before I got ill ? ' he went on . ' I was n't in my right mind . I said all kinds of things that I ought n't to have said , things that were n't true , things , for example , about Katy and that doctor from Johns Hopkins . ' But the doctor from johns Hopkins , as he had now discovered , was a cripple . And even if the man had n't had infantile paralysis as a boy , Katy was utterly incapable of even thinking anything of the kind . " And in a voice that trembled with feeling he proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate lie had been to win MAGAZINE and hold a wife at once so good , so beautiful , so sensible and yet so sensitive , so strung and faithful and devoted . Without her , he would have gone mad , broken down , fizzled out . And now she had saved his life , and the thought that he had said those wild , bad , senseless things about her tormented him . So would I please forget them or , if I remembered , remember them only as the ravings of a sick man . It was a relief , of course , not to have been found out , and yet , in sonic ways , this was worse  --  worse because the display of so much trust , such abysmal ignorance , made me feel ashamed of myself  --  and not only of myself , of Katy too . We were a pair of cheats , conspiring against a simpleton  --  a simpleton who , for sentimental reasons which did him nothing but credit , was doing his best to Make himself even more innocent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I managed to say a little of what was on my mind . At first she tried to stop my mouth with kisses . Then , when I pushed her away , she grew angry and threatened to go back to her room . 1 had the sacrilegious courage to restrain her by brute force . ' You 've got to listen , ' I said as she struggled to free herself . And holding her at arm 's length , as one holds a dangerous animal , I poured out my tale of moral anguish . Katy heard me out ; then , when it was all over , she laughed . Not sarcastically , not with the intention of wounding me , but from the sunny depths of a goddess 's amusement . You ca n't hear it , ' she teased . ' You 're too noble to be a party to a deception ! Ca n't you ever think of anything but your own precious self ? Think of me , for a change , think of Henry ! A sick genius and the poor woman whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerably sane . His huge , crazy intellect against my instincts , his inhuman denial of life against the flow of life in me . It was n't easy , I 've had to fight with every weapon that came to hand . And now here I have to listen to you  --  talking the most nauseous kind of Sunday School twaddle , daring to tell me  --  me  --  you can not live a lie  --  like George Washington and the cherry tree . You make me tired . I 'm going to sleep . ' She yawned and , rolling over on her side , turned her back on me  --  the back , " Rivers added with a little snort of laughter , " the infinitely eloquent back ( if you perused it in the dark , Iike Braille , with your finger tips ) of Aphrodite Callipygos . " And that , my friend , that was as near as Katy ever got to an explanation or an apologia . It left me no wiser than I was before . Indeed it left me considerably less wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of questions , to which she never vouchsafed any answers . Had she implied , for example , that this sort of thing was inevitable  --  at least in the circumstances of THE GENIUS AND her own marriage ? Had it , in actual fact , happened before ? And if so , when , how often , with whom ? " " Did you ever find out ? " I asked . Rivers shook his head . " I never got further than wondering and imagining  --  my God , how vividly ! Which was enough , of course , to make me more miserable than I 'd ever been . More miserable , and at the same time more frenziedly amorous . Why is it that , when you suspect a woman you love of having made love to somebody else , you should feel such a heightening of desire ? I had loved Katy to the limit . Now I found myself loving her beyond the limit , loving her desperately and insatiably , loving her with a vengeance , if you know what 1 mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been looking at me , ' she complained two evenings later , ' as though you were on a desert island and I were a beef steak . Do n't do it . People will notice . Besides , I 'm not a beef steak , I 'm an uncooked human being . And anyhow Henry 's almost well again , and the children will he coming home tomorrow . Things will have to go back to what they were before . We 've got to be sensible . ' To be sensible . . . I promised  --  for tomorrow . Meanwhile  --  put out the light ! ? there was this love with a vengeance , this desire which , even in the frenzy of its consummation , retained a quality of despair . The hours passed and in due course it was tomorrow  --  dawn between the curtains , birds in the garden , the anguish of the final embrace , the reiterated promises that I would be sensible . " And how faithfully I kept the promise ! After breakfast I went up to Henry 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nature . And when Katy came in from her marketing , I called her ' Mrs. Maartens ' and did my best to look as radiantly serene as she did . Which in my case , of course , was hypocrisy . In hers it was just a manifestation of the Olympian nature . " A little before ! until , the children came home , bag and baggage , in a cab . Katy was always the all-seeing mother ; but her all-seeingness was tempered , generally , by an easy tolerance of childish failings . This time , for some reason , it was different . Perhaps it was the miracle of Henry 's recovery that had gone to her head , that had given her not only a sense of power but also a desire to exercise that power in other ways . Perhaps , too , she had been intoxicated by her sudden restoration , after all those nightmare weeks , to a state of animal grace through satisfied desire . Anyhow , whatever the cause may have been , whatever the extenuating circumstances , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too all-seeing by half . She loved her children and their return filled her with joy ; and yet she was under a kind of compulsion , as soon as she saw them , to criticize , to find fault , to throw her maternal weight around . " Within two minutes of their arrival she had pounced on Timmy for having dirty ears ; within three , she had made Ruth confess that she was constipated ; and , within four , had inferred , from the fact that the child did n't want anyone to unpack for her , that she must be hiding some guilty secret . And there  --  when , at Katy 's orders , Beulah had opened the suitcase  --  there the poor little guilty secret lay revealed : a boxful of cosmetics and the half-empty bottle of synthetic violets . At the best of times Katy would have disapproved  --  but would have disapproved with sympathy , with an understanding chuckle . On this occasion , her disapproval was loud and sarcastic . She had the make-up kit thrown into the garbage can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poured the perfume into the toilet and pulled the plug . By the time we sat clown to our meal , the poetess , red-faced and her eyes still swollen with crying , hated everybody  --  hated her mother for having humiliated her , hated Beulah for having been such a good prophet , hated poor sirs . Hanbury for being dead and therefore in no further need of Katy 's ministrations , hated Henry for being well enough to have permitted this disastrous homecoming , and hated me because I had treated her as a child , had said her love poem was lousy , and had shown , still more unforgivably , that I preferred her mother 's company to her own . " Did she suspect anything ? " I asked . " She probably suspected everything , " Rivers answered . " But I thought you were being sensible . " W E WERE . But Ruth had always been jealous of her mother . And now her mother had hurt her , and at the same time she knew  --  theoretically , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of things that happen when men and women like one another . Ache of purple pulses ; lips inter-twisted and bitten . Et cetera . Even if nothing had ever happened between Katy and me , she 'd have believed that it had , and hated us accordingly , hated us with this new , more implacable kind of hate . In the past her hates had never lasted for more than a day or two . This time it was different . The hatred was unrelenting . For days on end she refused to talk to us , but sat there , through every meal , in a black silence , pregnant with unspoken criticisms and condemnations . " Poor little Ruth ! Dolores-Salome was , of course , a fiction , but a fiction founded on the solid facts of puberty . In outraging the fiction Katy and I , in our different ways , had outraged something real , something that was a living part of the child 's personality . She had come home with her perfume and her make-up , with her brand-new breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar 's sentiments  --  had come home full of vaguely wonderful expectations , vaguely horrifying apprehensions ; and what had happened to her ? The insult of being treated as what , in fact , she still was an irresponsible child . The outrage of not being taken seriously . The hurt and humiliation of finding herself rejected by the man she had chosen as her victim and Bluebeard , in favor of another woman  --  and , to make matters worse , the other woman was her own mother . Was it any wonder that all my efforts to laugh or cajole her out of her black mood were unavailing ? Leave her alone ' was Katy 's advice . ' Let her stew in her own juice , until she gets sick of it . ' " But the days passed and Ruth showed no signs of getting sick of it . On the contrary , she seemed to be enjoying the bitter tastes of wounded pride , of jealousy and suspicion . And then , about a week after the children 's return , something happened that turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Henry was now well enough to sit up , to walk about his room . A few clays more , and he would be fully convalescent . ' Let him spend a few weeks in the country , ' the doctor advised . But what with the bad weather in early spring , what with Katy 's absence in Chicago , the weekend farmhouse had been closed since Christmas . Before it could be lived in again , it would have to be aired and dusted and provisioned . ' Let 's go and do the job tomorrow , ' Katy suggested to use one morning at breakfast . Startlingly , like a prairie dog popping out of its burrow , Ruth emerged from the depths . of her malevolent silence . Tomorrow , she muttered angrily , she 'd be at school . And that , Katy answered , was why tomorrow would be such a good clay for doing the necessary chores . No work-shy poetesses mooning around and getting in the way . But I must come , ' R nth insisted with a strange kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Why must ? ' Ruth looked at her mother for a moment , then dropped her eyes . ' Because . . . ' she began , thought better of it , and broke off . Because I want to , ' she concluded lamely . Katy laughed and told her not to be silly . ' We 'll get off early , ' she said , turning back to me , ' and take a picnic basket . ' The child turned very pale , tried to eat her toast but could n't swallow , asked to be excused and , without waiting for an answer , got up , and ran out of the room . When I saw her again that afternoon , her face was a mask , blank but somehow menacing , of controlled hostility . " F ROM outside , in the hall , I had heard the creak of the front door being opened , then the bang of its dosing . And now there was the sound of footsteps and low voices . Rivers broke off and looked at his watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shook his head . Then , raising his voice , " Molly ! " he called . " Is that you ? " Open on a square of smooth white skin , on pearls and the bodice of a scarlet evening gown , a mink coat appeared in the doorway . Above it was a young face that would have been beautiful , if its expression had been less bitterly sullen . " Was it a nice party ? " Rivers asked . " Stinking , " said the young woman . " That 's why we 're home so early . Is n't it , Fred ? " she added , turning to a dark-haired young man who had followed her into the room . The young man gave her a look of cold distaste , and turned away . " Is n't it ? " she repeated more loudly , with a note in her voice almost of anguish . A faint smile appeared on the averted face and there was a shrug of the broad shoulders , but no answer . Rivers turned to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " When she was so high . " " And this , " he waved his hand in the direction of the dark young man , " is my son-in-law , Fred Shaughnessy . " I said 1 was pleased to meet him ; but the young man did n't even look at me . There was a silence . Molly drew a jeweled hand across her eyes . " I 've got a splitting headache , " she muttered . " Guess I 'll go to bed . " She started to walk away ; then halted and , with what was evidently an enormous effort , brought herself to say , " Good night . " " Good night , " we said in chorus . But she was already gone . Without a word , as though he were a gunman on her trail , the young man turned and followed her . Rivers sighed profoundly . " They 've got to the point , " he said , " where sex seems pretty dull unless it 's the consummation of a quarrel . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny .

And there 's nothing in either eventuality that I can do about it . Whatever happens , the child has got to go through hell . Maybe he 'll emerge all the better and stronger for it . Maybe he 'll be utterly destroyed . Who knows ? Certainly not these boys ! " He pointed with the stem of his pipe at a long shelf of Freudians and Jungians . " Psychology fiction ! It makes pleasant reading , it 's even rather instructive . But how much does it explain ? Eyetything except the essentials , everything except the two things that finally determine the course of our lives , Predestination and Grace . Look at Molly , for example . She had a mother who knew how to love without wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense enough to try to follow his wife 's example . She had two sisters who were happy as children and grew up to be successful wives and mothers . There were no quarrels in the household , no chronic tensions , no tragedies or explosions . By all the rules of psychology fiction , Molly ought to be thoroughly sane and contented . Instead of which . . . " He left the sentence unfinished . " And then there 's the other kind of Predestination . Not the inner Predestination of temperament and character , but the Predestination of events  --  the kind of Predestination that lay in wait for me and Ruth and Katy . Even through the wrong end of the opera glasses one does n't like to look at it . " There was a long silence , which I did not presume to break . W E I.

' Yes , I have , ' she said emphatically , and there was a little smile on her face more baleful even than the previous blankness . May I see it ? ' To my great surprise , she said yes . The thing was n't quite finished ; but tomorrow without fail . I forgot all about the promise ; but the next morning , sure enough , as she was leaving for school , Ruth handed me one of her mauve envelopes . ' Here it is. ' she said . ' I hope you 'll like it .

Katy waved back and blew a kiss . ' I feel like John Gilpin , ' she said happily as we turned out of the driveway . ' AU agog to dash through thick and thin . ' " It was one of those lyrical days in early May , one of those positively Shakespearean mornings . There had been rain in the night , and now all the trees were curtseying to a fresh wind : the young leaves glittered like jewels in the sunlight ; the great marbly clouds on the horizons were something Michelangelo had dreamed in a moment of ecstatic happiness and superhuman power . And then there were the flowers .

" We did our work , ate our picnic lunch , we smoked our cigarettes on deck chairs in the sun . But the sun was too hot and we decided to finish our nap indoors ; and then what anybody could have told us would happen duly happened . . . . Happened as I suddenly discovered between two ecstasies , under the eyes of a three-quarter-length portrait of Henry Maartens , commissioned and presented to him by the directors of some big electrical company that had profited by his professional advice , and so monstrous in its photographic realism that it had been relegated to the spare bedroom at the farm . It was one of those portraits that are always looking at you , like Big Brother in Orwell 's 1984 . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black cutaway coat , solemnly glaring  --  the very embodiment of public opinion , the painted symbol and projection of my own guilty conscience . And next to the portrait was a Victorian wardrobe with a looking-glass door that reflected the tree outside the window and , within the room , part of the bed , part of the two bodies dappled with sunlight and the moving shadows of oak leaves . ' Forgive them , for they know not what they do . ' " But here , what with the portrait and the mirror , there was no possibility of ignorance . And the knowledge of what we had done became even more disquieting when , half an hour later , as I put on my jacket , I heard the crackle of stiff paper in a side pocket , and remembered Ruth 's mauve envelope . The poem , this time , was a narrative , in four-line stanzas , a kind of ballad about two adulterers , a faithless wife and her lover , before the bar of God at the Last Judgment . Standing there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripped by invisible hands of all their disguises , garment after garment , until at last they 're stark naked . More than stark naked , indeed ; for their resurrected bodies are transparent . Lights and liver , bladder and guts , every organ , with its specific excrement  --  all , all arc revoltingly visible . And suddenly they find that they are not alone , but on a stage , under spotlights , in the midst of millions of spectators , tier on tier of them , retching with uncontrollable disgust as they look , or jeering , denouncing , calling for vengeance , howling for the whip and the branding iron . " There was a kind of Early Christian malignity about the piece , which was all the more terrifying because Ruth had been brought up completely outside the pale of that hideous kind of fundamentalism . Judgment , hell , eternal punishment  --  these were n't things she 'd been taught to believe in . They were notions she had adopted for her own special purposes , in order to express what she felt about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; jealousy and rebuffed love , hurt vanity , angry resentment . And the resentment had to be given a respectable motive , the anger transformed into righteous indignation . She suspected the worst of us so that she might he justified in feeling the worst . And she suspected the worst so vehemently that , in next to no time , she was n't guessing any more , she knew that we were guilty . And , knowing it , the child in her was outraged , the woman felt more bitterly , vengefully jealous than before . With a horrible sinking of the heart , a mounting terror in the face of an incalculable future , I read the thing to the end , read it again , then turned to where Katy was sitting before the mirror on the dressing table , pinning up her hair . smiling at the radiantly smiling image of a goddess , and humming a tune out of " The Marriage of Figaro . " Dove song i bei moinenti Di dolcezza e di piace ? ? I had always admired that divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , suddenly , it enraged me . She had no right not to be feeling what the reading of Ruth 's poem had made me feel . " ' Do you want to know , ' I said , ' why our little Ruthy has been acting the way she has ? Do you want to know what she really thinks of us ? ' And crossing the room , I handed her the two sheets of purple notepaper on which the child had copied out her poem . Katy started to read . Studying her face I saw the original look of amusement ( for Ruth 's poetry was a standing joke in the family ) give place to an expression of serious , concentrated attention . Then a vertical wrinkle appeared on the forehead between the eyes . The frown deepened and , as she turned to the second page , she bit her lip . The goddess , after all , was vulnerable . - . I had scored my point ; but it was a poor sort of triumph that ended with there being two bewildered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the kind of trap that Katy was totally unequipped to get out of . Most uncomfortable situations she just Ignored , just sailed through as though they didn'texist . And in effect , if she went on ignoring them long enough and serenely enough , they stopped existing . The people she had offended forgave her , because she was so beautiful and good-humored ; the people who had worried themselves sick , or made complications for others , succumbed to the contagion of her godlike indifference and momentarily forgot to be neurotic or malignant . " And when the technique of being serenely unaware did n't work , there was her other gambit ? the technique of rushing in where angels fear to tread ; the technique of being gaily tactless , of making enormous bloomers in all innocence and simplicity , of uttering the most unmentionable truths with the most irresistible of smiles . But this was a case where neither of these methods would work . If she said nothing , Ruth would go on acting as she had acted up till now . Anti if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disturbed adolescent might do . " And meanwhile there was Henry to think of , there was her own future as the sole and , we were all convinced , the utterly indispensable support of a sick genius and his children . Ruth was in the position , and might even now he in the mood , to pull down the whole temple of their lives for the sake of spiting her mother . And there was nothing that a woman who had the temperament of a goddess , without the goddess 's omnipotence , could do about it . There was , however , something that I could do ; and as we discussed our situation  --  for the first time , remember , since there had been a situation to discuss ! ? it became more and more clear what that something was . I could do what I had felt I ought to do after that first apocalyptic night  --  clear out " Katy would n't hear of it at first , and I had to argue with her all the way home  --  argue against myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was convinced . It was the only way out of the trap . R C T H eyed us , when we got home , like a detective searching for clues . Then she asked me if I liked her poem . I told her  --  which was strictly true  --  that it was the best thing she had ever written . . . . She was pleased , but did her best not to show it . The smile which lit up her face was almost instantly repressed and she asked me , in an intently meaningful way , what I had thought of the poem 's subject . I was prepared for the question and answered with an indulgent chuckle . It reminded me , I said , of the sermons my poor dear father used to preach in Lent . Then 1 looked at my watch , said something about urgent work and left her , as I could see by the expression on her face , discomfited . She had looked forward , I suppose , to a scene " Even through the wrong end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different people ... " He shook his head . " There are certain things that are simply inadmissible . " There was a pause . " Well , let 's get it over with , " he said at last . " About two miles this side of the farm there was a crossroad where you had to turn left . It was in a wood and the leaves were so thick you could n't see what was corning from either ' side . When we got there , I slowed down , I honked my horn , I put the car into low and turned . And suddenly , as I rounded the bend , there was the Overland roadster in the ditch , upside down , and near it a big truck with its radiator smashed in . And between the two cars was a young man in blue denims kneeling by a child , who was screaming . Ten or fifteen feet away there were two things that looked like bundles of old clothes , like garbage  --  garbage with blood on it . " There was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Katy died a few minutes after we came on the scene , and Ruth died in the ambulance on the way to the hospital . Timmy was being reserved for a worse death at Okinawa : he got off with some cuts and a couple of broken ribs . He was sitting at the back , he told us , with Katy driving , and Ruth beside her on the front seat . The two of them had been having an argument , and Ruth was mad about something  --  he did n't know what , because he was n't listening : he was thinking of a way of electrifying his clockwork train and anyhow he never paid much attention to what Ruth said when she was mad . If you paid attention to her , it just made things worse . But his mother had paid attention . He remembered her saving , ' You do n't know what you 're talking about , ' and then , ' I forbid you to say those things . ' And then they turned the corner , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horn and that huge truck hit them broadside on . " So you see , " Rivers concluded , " it was really both kinds of Predestination . The Predestination of events , and at the same time the Predestination of two temperaments , Ruth 's and Katy 's  --  the temperament of an outraged child , who was also a jealous woman : and the temperament of a goddess , cornered by circumstances and suddenly realizing that , objectively , she was only a human being , for whom the Olympian temperament might actually be a handicap . And the discovery was so disturbing that it made her careless , left her incapable of dealing adequately with the events by which she was predestined to he destroyed  --  and destroyed ( but this was for my benefit , of course , this was an item in my psychological Predestination ) with every refinement of physical outrage  --  an eye put out by a splinter of glass , the nose and lips and chin almost oblit-erated , rubbed out on the bloody macadam of the road . And there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shinbone showing through the stocking . It was something I dreamed about practically every night . Katy with her back to me : and she was either on the bed in the farmhouse , or else standing by the window in my room , throwing the shawl over her shoulders . Then she 'd turn and look at me , and there was no face , only that expanse of scraped flesh , and I 'd wake up screaming . I got to the point where I did n't dare to go to sleep at night . " Listening to him , I remembered that young John Rivers whom , to my great surprise , I had found at Beirut , in ' twenty-five , teaching physics at the American University . " Was that why you looked so horribly ill ? " I asked . He nodded his head . " Too little sleep and too much memory , " he said . " I was afraid of going mad , and rather than go mad , I 'd decided to kill myself . Then , just in the nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the only brand of saving Grace that could do me any good . I met Helen . " " At the same cocktail party , " I put in , " where I met her . Do you remember ? " " Sorry , I do n't . I do n't remember anybody on that occasion except Helen . If you 've been saved from drowning , you remember the lifeguard , but not the spectators on the pier . " " No wonder I never had a chance ! " I said . " At the time I used to think , rather bitterly , that it was because women , even the best of them , the rare extraordinary Helens , prefer good looks to artistic sensibility , prefer brawn with brains ( for was forced to admit that you had some brains ! ) to brains with that exquisite je ne sais quoi which was my specialty . Now I see what your irresistible attraction was . You were unhappy . " He nodded his agreement , and there was a long silence . A clock struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finishing off my whisky , I got up to go . " You have n't told me what happened to poor old Henry after the accident . " W ELL , HE BEGAN , of course , by having a relapse . Not a very bad one . He had nothing to gain , this time , by going to death 's door . Just a mild affair . Katy 's sister came down for the funeral and stayed on to look after him . She was like a caricature of Katy . Fat , florid , loud . Not a goddess disguished as a peasant  --  a barmaid imagining she was a goddess . She was a widow . Four months later Henry married her . I 'd gone to Beirut by that time ; so I never witnessed their connubial bliss . But from all accounts it was considerable . But the poor woman could n't keep her weight down . She diedin ' thirty-five . Henry quickly found himself a young blonde called Alice . Alice wanted to be admired for her thirty-eight-inch bust , but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of Schriidinger ? ' you 'd ask him ; but it would be Alice who answered . She saw him through to the end . " " When did you see him last ? " I asked . " Just a few months before he died . Eighty-seven and still amazingly active , still chock-full of what his biographer likes to call ' the undiminished blaze of intellectual power . ' To me he seemed like an overwound clockwork monkey . Clockwork ratiocination ; clockwork gestures , clockwork smiles and grimaces . And then there was the conversation . What amazingly realistic tape recordings of the old anecdotes about Planck and Rutherford and J. J. Thompson ! Of his celebrated soliloquies about Logical Positivism and Cybernetics ! Of reminiscences about those exciting war years when he was working on the A-bomb ! Of his gaily apocalyptic speculations about the bigger and better Infernal Machines of the future ! You could have sworn that it was a real human being who was talking . But gradually , as you went on listening , you began to realize that there was nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was vox el praeterea nihil  --  the voice of Henry ' Martens without his presence . " " But is n't that the thing you were recommending ? " I asked . " Dying every moment . " " But Henry had n't died . That 's the whole point . He 'd merely left the clockwork running and gone somewhere else . " " Gone where ? " " God knows . Into some kind of infantile burrow in his subconscious , I suppose . Outside , for all to sec and hear , was that stupendous clockwork monkey , that undiminished blaze of intellectual power . Inside there lurked the miserable little creature who still needed flattery and reassurance and sex and a womb-substitute  --  the creature who would have to face the music on Henry 's deathbed . That was still frantically alive and unprepared , by any preliminary dying , totally unprepared for the decisive moment . Well , the decisive moment is over HOW and whatever remains of poor old Henry is probably squeaking and gibbering in the streets of Los Alamos , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . And of course nobody pays any attention , nobody gives a damn . Quite rightly . Let the dead bury their dead . And now you want to go . " He got up , took my arm , and walked me out into the hall . " Drive carefully , " he said as he opened the front door . " This is a Christian country and it 's the Saviour 's birthday . Practically everybody you see will be drunk . "
