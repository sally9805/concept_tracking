txt The United States Government is studying an important French air force proposal that would add 50 per cent to the French frontline airpower assigned to the North Atlantic Treaty air ' forces by 1956 . The plan calls ' for $1,471,000,000 in additional financing by the United States and would increase the French air force assigned to the Atlantic alliance from about 1,500 to 2,300 planes . The French proposal has been ) studied in detail by Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther , who has been desig-1 nated as the new Supreme Allied Commander in Europe , and has been forwarded to Washington for its comments and decision . The plan reached Washington at about the time that Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway , retiring Supreme ' Allied Commander in Europe , was ' warning the United States Congress of the continuing critical weakness in the present combat air strength of the Atlantic alliance forces . On the other hand , both United States and French air forces are being faced , separately , by planned budget cuts . Studies newly completed by French air experts reveal that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use by the Atlantic alliance powers from Norway to Turkey between now and the end of the current Allied air ' build-up program , around 1957 . " This is a logistics nightmare , " la French air expert said . " Imagine the complexities of manufacturing , stocking , cataloguing and supplying more than fifty separate sets of spare parts  --  each set number- ing thousands or items  --  for airplanes in nine countries . We should not be using more than eight types of military aircraft throughout the whole of the Atlantic Alliance at the very most . The French Air , Force , which was the world 's greatest after World War I , and which has made a significant comeback in the last five years , is regarded with growing respect by United States , British and other Allied commanders . Despite the deliberate waste and confusion introduced in 1945 by the Communist French Air Minister appointed soon after the liberation , French air chiefs ruthlessly have slashed the number of prototypes from thirty in 1946 to eight today . The chiefs have built a permanent air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded to 227,000 . They also have pruned the faltering nationalized aviation industry  --  once packed with Socialist sympathizers  --  from 100,000 in 1946 to about 50,000 now . The recently announced $500 , - 000,000 Atlantic Alliance procurement order in Europe for 1,200 combat planes , to which the United States is contributing $281,000,000 , was inspired and planned largely with French support . The contract for $86,000,000 worth of French-designed Mystere Mark IV supersonic fighter interceptors has been cited as a tribute to the post-war comeback of French aeronautical skill . In this context French air leaders assert their own military aviation program is approaching an important crossroads in the next six to twelve months . With 1,800 new planes for the Atlantic Alliance forces needed each year , the issue is whether France will continue with Plan A , which now guides her air rearmament program , or whether she can win United States support in switching to Plan B , a more ambitious and costly effort . The basic facts of Plan A are as follows : 1,500 French combat aircraft ' will be . in Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interceptor Day Fighters and the rest all-weather interceptors , fighter-bombers , light bombers , transport and reconnaissance type craft . The cost of Plan A by 1957 will be approximately $7,000,000,000 , to which the United States has agreed to contribute *1,319,000,000 to help France achieve her air commitment to the Atlantic alliance . The proposed Plan B , the latest of a series of intensive studies into French air capability , would give France in 1955 2,300 front-line aircraft for the Atlantic alliance . of which more than 1,000 would be Associated Pre . Gen. Alfred NI- arnenther Interceptor Day Fighters , with the remainder all-weather interceptors , fighter bombers , light bombers , transport and reconnaissance craft The over-all cost of Plan B has been estimated at $7,930,000,000 , with the peak output in 1956 . The United States contribution to this proposed program would rise to $2,790,000,000 . French technicians note that Plan A would leave France by 1957 with an annual output of 500 new combat planes for service in the Atlantic alliance , whereas Plan B would increase this annual output to 760 new combat planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indo-China , training and so forth . United States defense and aid officials , to whom both plans have been carefully explained , are said to have been " very interested " but they have made no commitments that . would bind the United States Government . With the United States already spending more than $1,000,000,000 to help restore the war-shattered French aviation industry , they have said it is unlikely than any further expansion can be underwritten now by the United States Treasury ? though the matter rests in Washington 's hands . Yet to the French , the coming year 1954 will be the year for decision because of the normal two . year lead time in designing , planning and producing new combat planes . They are waiting for word whether they are to continue with Plan A or expand gradually under Plan B to an eventual normal peacetime strength of 2,300 front line aircraft and 200,000 men in their air force .
