Bracing his lanky Texas frame against his polished first-row desk , Majority Leader Lyndon Baines Johnson early one evening last week delivered his latest plea for nonpartisanship in the U.S. Senate . He had a good partisan reason . Far from indulging in nonpartisanship as Lyndon likes it , Republican Senators were heightening their resistance to pell-mell Democratic antirecession spending . <P> Back from a recess that revealed most constituents calm and cautious ( TIME , April 14 ) , buoyed by the President 's stinging vetoes and preachments against panic , the G.O.P. , with the session 's tightest discipline , was earnestly tossing roadblocks into the path of the freewheeling Democratic majority . <P> Idle Gestures . The week 's first roadblock loomed up when Johnson cast around for the two-thirds Senate vote needed to override the White House vetoes of 1 ) the bill to freeze farm price supports at 1957 levels and 2 ) the lard-heavy rivers-and-harbors authorization . He soon counted too many Republican noes . " I do n't believe in idle gestures , " said he , and gracefully helped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it mildew for the rest of the session . The pork-barrel bill went to the Public Works Committee for a word-for-word review that might skim off the lard that Ike rejected . <P> A second roadblock was thrown up during the maneuvering over Arkansas Democrat J. William Fulbright 's Community Facilities Bill to provide long-term ( 50 years ) public-works loans to small cities with low credit ratings . Fortnight ago , Republicans on Fulbright 's Banking and Currency Committee ( joined by Democrats Paul Douglas of Illinois , Allen Frear Jr . of Delaware and Willis Robertson of Virginia ) trimmed the bill 's total from $2 billion to $1 billion , upped the proposed interest rate from 3% to 3% . <P> When the bill was called on the Senate floor last week , Fulbright doggedly introduced a 3% interest amendment . But Republicans pulled him up short a second time . They argued that the lower interest rate was a short-term rate unsuitable to long-term loans , defeated the amendment ( 41-40 ) in a straight party vote . But when the bill had been shaped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60-26 ) and send to the House the measure making loans available for small-town schools , hospitals , sewers , parks and recreational facilities . <P> Odd Base . During the debate over the interest rate , Bill Fulbright took off onto a new and unusual line of advocacy . Arguing for his 3% interest , he ticked off foreign nations that have fared as well or better with U.S. loans : " Afghanistan pays 3% on its mutual-security-program loan . Burma paid 2 ? on an overseas surplus property loan . Nationalist China under the mutual-security program has been paying 3% . " Cried he : " It is beyond my understanding why grants to that extent and loans for economic development in the amount of more than $41 million can be extended at 3% , and yet objection is made so strenuously to the 3% provided in the bill . "
