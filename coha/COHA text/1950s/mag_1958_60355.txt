When most Thoroughbred fans contemplate racing in our great western states the only tracks that come readily to mind are those palatial California establishments , Santa Anita and Hollywood Park . Very little is known  --  outside the western states  --  of a whole new wonderful world of racing which accentuates fun and minor opportunity for the average horseman instead of wealth and publicity for the big-name stable owner . // There is in the West today a highly profitable secondary racing circuit encompassing hundreds of thousands of square miles and ranging all the way from Caliente in Old Mexico , eastward through New Mexico to Denver and Omaha , and north to Tucson , Seattle , Spokane , Great Falls , Mont . and Vancouver . The names of the tracks in this minor league  --  like Rillito Park , La Mesa Park , Ruidoso Downs , Longacres , Playfair , Centennial Park  --  may not ring proudly in terms of attendance , pari-mutuel handle , or the quality of horses stabled there , but nonetheless it is in just this sort of circuit that are buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earliest quarter horse winner-take-all match race over a rough and often dangerous strip , to the glory of a day when the whole racing world stood to salute a team of Arizona ranchers named Rex Ellsworth and Mish Tenney when they took the great Swaps out of the West to win the Kentucky Derby . // The secondary western circuit  --  often called the Mountain Circuit  --  has a winter capital in the growing community of Phoenix , Arizona . There , in an area where the metropolitan population has grown from 262,000 to 380,000 in five years , the race course known as Turf Paradise has been setting a fast pace for the last two years . // Walter R. Cluer , the mastermind behind Turf Paradise , is both an experienced horseman and a successful Phoenix construction company executive . Cluer built his track 14 miles from downtown Phoenix , out in the desert . In 1954 he bought 1,400 acres of land at prices ranging from $250 to $1,250 an acre . Today , barely two years after Turf Paradise first opened , the land around is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while already more than 210 new manufacturing concerns have started operations in Phoenix since 1951 , the city is getting ready for the biggest invasion yet of electrical and precision tool manufacturers  --  most of them , as Cluer had long estimated , planning to move directly northwest of the city and as directly in line with the inviting gates of Turf Paradise . // The racing plant itself is ready now for its new clients . Built at a cost of $2 ? million , it has 5,000 permanent seats and could handle 15,000 with little trouble . With the extra acreage which the track owns it could some day park 28,000 cars , and there 's nothing but space in every direction ( except up into the Squaw Peak range ) for additional facilities . The barns , containing 844 stalls , are solid concrete with steel doors and are 100% fireproof . On one side of the mile track ( which when dry is certainly one of the fastest in the country ) is a 3,200-foot landing strip for private planes , and across from it the Turf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California or Florida . In short , Turf Paradise is all that its name implies . // The racing here is conducted by two independent groups in complete harmony . One of the meetings , logically enough , is known simply as Turf Paradise . The other , a 40-day meeting now in progress under the able general managership of Jim Herbuveaux , is known as Arizona Downs at Turf Paradise . // Turf Paradise is , of course , a long way from being a threat to California as a profitable place to go winter racing . The average crowd for its four racing days each week is about 4,300 , and the daily handle only around $160,000 ( a record crowd of 7,100 recently showed up on a Sunday when Willie Shoemaker flew in to ride one of Ellsworth 's horses , and on that day the handle was $248,576 ) . The result is that the track can little afford extravagance in purse distribution : a $1,000 minimum on Wednesdays and weekends , and an $800 minimum on Fridays . The biggest stakes are $5,000 ( there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for a man dealing with horses worth up to $3,000 , $5,000 in prize money can look mighty appealing . // There is a definite place in racing for tracks like Turf Paradise . They offer opportunities for the smaller owner whose stock is not good enough to get him into the big leagues but who surely belongs in horse racing just the same . At the same time many a large California stable ( Rex Ellsworth and Andy Crevolin , just to name two ) can split into two divisions and send one string around the Mountain Circuit . They offer a training ground for young riders , a lot of whom at Turf Paradise are just discovering that the newly installed film patrol has a keen eye . If the progressive Walter Cluer and Jim Herbuveaux can continue to boost their business by 15% each year ( as they did last season ) , they 'll not only make a small profit for the first time in 1958 , but in effect will also be shouting , " Turf Paradise is in business in a big way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
