In a moment of high Gallic drama , President Charles de Gaulle entered the resort town of Vichy fortnight ago for the first time since World War II , emotionally told a cheering crowd : " We are a single people , the great , the only , the unique French people . " This statement , delivered in the seat of Marshal Henri Philippe Ptain 's wartime collaborationist government , seemed to most Frenchmen to be De Gaulle 's way of saying that the time had come to forgive and forget World War II collaboration with the Germans . Last week his countrymen learned once again how risky it is to interpret their unbending leader . <P> Up for election to the august French Academy , established 325 years ago by Cardinal Richelieu to safeguard the purity of the French language , was Novelist Paul ( Ouvert la Nuit ) Morand . At 70 he was suitably ancient , with his Scott Fitzgeraldish novels of the ' 20s had more claim to literary distinction than many of the " immortals " already in the academy . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumania , then to Switzerland . <P> Morand 's first bid for election to the academy failed last year , after ten outstanding academicians publicly denounced his pro-Vichy record . This time , 18 of the academy 's 36 members were pledged to vote for him , and he seemed likely to squeeze in . But minutes before the " immortals " were to start balloting , Morand withdrew his candidacy . The reason : pressure from De Gaulle . <P> Morand said that De Gaulle ( whose titles as President of France include that of Protector of the Academy ) had asked him through intermediaries to postpone " a candidacy that , at present , still provokes too much partisan hatred . " What really decided Morand , said Paris gossip , was the warning that De Gaulle would not receive him , if and when it came time for Morand to make the newly elected academician 's traditional call on the President of the Republic . <P> Despite his willingness to let bygones be bygones , De Gaulle had not forgotten that Vichy had once sentenced him to death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to paying an ex-collaborator public honor .
