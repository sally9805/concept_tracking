Once it would have been big news in Wall Street . But there was scarcely a ripple last week when J. P. Morgan &; Co . Inc. chose a new president . Since the coming of the New Deal , the once mighty bank has been forced to give up its underwriting business , thus lost the chief source of its power . <P> Henry Clay Alexander , 48 , the new president , was born in Murfreesboro , Tenn. , and went from Vanderbilt University ( ' 23 ) and Yale Law School to corporation practice with Morgan Lawyers Davis , Polk , Wardwell , Gardiner &; Reed . He was a Morgan partner by the time he was 36 . For the past 22 months , as executive vice president , he has been in line to move up . As he did , President George Whitney became chairman , replacing longtime Morgan Partner Russell C. Leffingwell , who , at 72 , stepped down to vice chairman .                  @ @ @
