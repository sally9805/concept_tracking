RCA Victor , biggest of all U.S. record manufacturers , took a bold step , chopped from 40% to 23% off its highest-priced LPs and EPs ( mostly classical music ) . All Victor twelve-inch LPs ( except original-cast show albums ) now list at $3.98 , all ten-inch at $2.98 apiece . <P> The record-price situation has long been as complicated as a Stravinsky score . A single company might have as many as 21 different " suggested list prices , " for its different lines , speeds and performances , ranging from 89 to $5.95 . Furthermore , record dealers offer discounts , some as high as 30% , so that a customer might buy a $5.95 LP in one shop and find the same disk for as little as $4.25 in another shop . <P> Victor 's move to simplify this maze simply brings list prices down to what people are paying at many discount dealers anyhow . Industry men and dealers sputtered as they heard the news . Columbia , Victor 's biggest competitor , was caught with its policy down , hastily announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but such high-cost items as the Casals Festival recordings will sell at $4.95 or $5.95 ) . London also cut to Victor 's level , except for operas . Both Angel , with its luxurious , factory-sealed albums imported from Britain , and Westminster bravely insisted that they would maintain present prices ( standard top : $5.95 ) . Several small labels said they were cutting prices , although the competition may drive some independents out of business .
