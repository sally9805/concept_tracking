This is the " dying hour of Protestantism " in Germany , said Germany 's neutralist-minded Pastor Martin Niemller , as quoted this week in the Christian Century . " Should the forced partition of our people persist , then . . . Romanization threatens in the West in the near future , while the existence of Protestantism behind the Iron Curtain can at best continue for only one generation . At present , everything indicates that Romanization here and Sovietization there can hardly be opposed with a chance of success . " If the state uses its authority to impose Christianity , says Niemller , " Protestantism will go to pot . " <P> The Philip Murray Memorial Foundation , established by the C.I.O. in honor of its late president , a Roman Catholic , announced two grants : $200,000 to the National Council of Churches to be used " on behalf of the practical application of religious principles to the everyday world of economic life , " and $150,000 to the Roselia Foundling and Maternity Hospital ( Catholic ) in Pittsburgh .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
