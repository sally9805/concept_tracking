txt ALLIES SET TERMS FOR SUMMIT TALKS IN NOTES TO SOVIET U.

S .. ** French and West German notes . Page 2 . By VV1/ ... / . L.4.31- J. JOREIEN SOcCaal to 1-11e New Vor . Tuzaes WASHINGTON , March 26 ? The Western Big Three formally invited the Soviet Union today to join them at a foreign ministers ' conference to discuss Germany and to arrange a summit meeting . Notes outlining the United States , British and French positions on negotiating agreements with the Russians were delivered in Moscow by ambassadors of the three Allied governments along with a message from West Germany . The Big Three proposed that their foreign ministers meet at Geneva May 11 with their Soviet counterpart . The promise of the Western governments to go on to a conference of the heads of government was made conditional on developments at the ministerial level . Broader Agenda Proposed The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader in scope than that advanced earlier by Moscow . In addition to the Berlin situation and a German peace treaty , suggested by Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev of the Soviet Union as appropriate subjects , the United States and Britain listed " questions relating to Germany " as the main item to be discussed . The French went further , maintaining that the foreign ministers should be allowed " freedom of discussion " to talk about matters of concern to their governments . Britain and the United States suggested a summit meeting " later in the summer " if all went well . The French said merely ' ' at an appropriate " time . The United States note , in // wording similar to that used by the British and French , advanced the following as the purpose of the proposed foreign ministers ' sessions : q " To reach positive agreements over as wide a field as possible . " II " In any case , to narrow the differences between the respective points of view . " l'i " To prepare constructive proposals for consideration by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wording concerned conditions under which a summit gathering would be considered justified . The ' United States note spoke of the meeting " as soon as developments in the foreign ministers ' meeting justify "  --  the British said " warrant " ? it . Again , the French were stronger , asking that there be " genu ine progress " among the ministers . The date , place and subjectMatter for a summit meeting should be decided by the foreign ministers , the Western powers said . They stated that the heads of government should consider and try to solve " wider problems " such as those mentioned by Premier Khrushchev , in his March 2 note , to which they were replying . Germany , divided into West Germany and the pro-Communist East Germany , is without a peace treaty fourteen years . after World War The Berlin issue was raised in a speech by Premier Khrushchev last Nov. 27 , in which he threatened to turn Western-occupied West Berlin into a free city in six months . Among the items the Soviet leader listed in his March 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutual withdrawal of armed forces from the line separating the Eastern and Western pow- , ers in Europe and setting up a zone free of nuclear weapons , reducing armed forces , and banning nuclear tests . There was considerable optimism in diplomatic circles that the proposals made today would be acceptable to Moscow . However , some experts on Soviet affairs took a more pessimistic view . Broadening the agenda of the foreign ministers ' meetings and linking progress at those meetings to the holding of a summit meeting have been attacked in the past by Moscow as opening up the way to the Western powers to delay and even prevent a summit meeting . It was noted here that Mr. Khrushchev 's earlier acceptance of the idea of a foreign ministers ' meeting envisaged a conference on his terms , not on those the Western Big Three outlined today . The West rejected Poland and Czechoslovakia as full participants in the foreign minister 's meeting . This rejection , too , may be spurned by Mr. Khrushchev , it was believed . The Western powers softened their rejection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example ) that the " possibility of the participation of other governments " at some stage in the talks could be " contemplated . ' In the last year Moscow has been demanding equal representation of Communist and non-Communist states in , its various conference proposals . This " parity " position has been rejected by the West and was turned down once again implicitly in today 's messages . Diplomatic sources here , while noting the comparatively slight differences in wording in the Allied notes today , regarded the differences as not of great importance . What counted , these sources said , was not the words themselves but what was meant by the governments that used them . Differing Views Cited The British incline to the view that a breakdown at the foreign ministers ' level might , in fact , make a summit meeting more urgent than otherwise . The French insist that clear evidence at the preliminary talks that the Russians were not interested in budging from past positions would indicate a summit session would be worthless . The United States stand , less precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in authority here has yet defined what was meant by " progress " in the ministerial talks . Sam Rayburn , Speaker of the House , who rarely volunteers advice to the Executive Branch on foreign affairs matters , took up this problem today . In a brief talk with reporters outside the House chamber , he said that to say the West would goto the ' summit whatever happened at the foreign ministers conference would " open the door " to the Soviet Union to make the latter meeting a failure .
