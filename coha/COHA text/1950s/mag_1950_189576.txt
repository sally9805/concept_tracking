At a Russian airfield near Berlin one day last week , a passerby paused to ask a cement worker what he was doing . The worker looked up sullenly and muttered : " It 's all for peace , my friend , all for peace . " <P> For more than a year , East Germany 's bricklayers , asphalt , steel and cement workers have gone through an unprecedented period of full employment , building runways , flak emplacements and barrack ? for the Soviet air force . East German taxpayers paid the costs . German labor offices had to recruit thousands of workers . If the labor offices failed , their functionaries were demoted or arrested . If German workers demurred , they were told : " Well , you can go into the People 's Police or the uranium mines if you prefer . " There is now a massive and menacing concentration of Russian air power in the Soviet zone of Germany ( see map ) . <P> Russian airmen are proudest of their jets , boast that they cruise at about 450 m.p.h. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently , some officers have been heard bragging of a new jet capable of a supersonic 800 m.p.h . " With a ship like that , " one Red airman gloated , " we can give America hell . We might not come back alive , but it will be worth it . " <P> Such bits of gossip are scarce , because the Soviet air force lives in strict seclusion ; the bright blue shoulder boards of the Red airmen are seen only rarely by East zone Germans . Airmen and service troops are frequently moved from one airfield to another to prevent accurate estimates of their strength . There are also frequent exchanges of personnel between East Germany and the Soviet Union , so that as many pilots as possible may familiarize themselves with the terrain and weather conditions of Eastern and Central Europe . <P> About 30 airfields in Soviet Germany are in active use , but many others are kept in first-rate condition the year round . Most of the fields are distributed in three thick clusters-one to the north , in Mecklenburg , one ringing Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle formed by Dessau , Altenburg and Cottbus . The major fields in Mecklenburg are at Peene-mnde and Rechlin-Lrz . Some 200 fighters , a few reconnaissance planes and light bombers are based at Peenemnde , along with 3,000 service troops and 600 airmen , most of them officers . <P> The most important fields in the Berlin area are Finow , Oranienburg and Strausberg . Each of these fields and most of those in the southern triangle boast at least a squadron of jets . On all the fields there are also fairly heavy concentrations of Russian fighters of older types , as well as light bombers , Stormovik dive bombers , transports and training planes . Many of the new concrete runways are being built with subsurface layers from 16 to 24 inches deep . The old Luftwaffe runways are to be lengthened to at least 6,500 and usually 8,000 feet , which will be adequate to the needs of the Reds ' most powerful jets .
