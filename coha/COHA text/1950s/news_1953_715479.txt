txt I LONDON , May ** latest proposals put forward by the United Nations at the Panmunjom negotiations for a Korean truce have the " complete support " of the British Government , Sir Winston Churchill , the Prime Minister , declared in a statement tonight ' from 10 Downing Street . The implication was that they ; had been endorsed by the Commonwealth as well and by the United Nations Governments directly concerned , for the statement said that secret as the proposals must re- , main for the present all interested ( parties had been consulted . Presumably there was no dissent or the Queen 's First Minister , who is also acting as Foreign Secretary during Anthony Eden 's illness and absence from the Foreign Office , would not have spoken for so many . This may be taken as Britain 's , the Commonwealth 's and perhaps Western Europe 's reaction to the Soviet Union 's refusal even to send its deputy to today 's meeting to discuss the possibility of reaching agreement on a treaty restoring Austrian independence . Kremlin 's Coolness ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to relieve ; the strain on relations between ' the United States and its Euro-I pean allies . Following as it did Pravda 's strictures against any attempt by the Western Powers to agree among themselves before a FourPower. meeting , it seems to have cooled off Sir Winston . His statement on Korea indicates that he leans now more to the skepticism of the United States Administration Ulan he did a week ago . However , the Western deputies lost no time today in replying to the Soviet 's rejection of an invitation to further talks on the Austrian treaty . They adopted a united front . Without dissent , they dispatched a message saying simply that they could not see why , at this late date , it was necessary for the Council of Foreign Ministers to convene their meeting when they had been doing it themselves ' since 1947 , on 260 occasions . This sudden insistence by Russia ' ? // on the strict observance of the Potsdam Protocol , which set up the Council of Foreign Ministers , was mystifying to the diplomats directly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the reason why the Soviet Union , after seeming to woo Western statesmen with fair words , suddenly switched around to the bad old words of Stalin 's time . An obvious answer was that Premier George M. Malenkov must be losing his grip and his control over the junta , or cabal , that shares his power . The big question confronting American and foreign diplomats here today was- why , with what motive , had the Russians rejected for the first time even an invitation to sit in on one of those Austrian treaty meetings that they have blocked so often . Several explanations were offered in addition to the one that Mr. Malenkov had lost his grip . The most interesting one for speculation was ; that it was a clever move to drive the wedge deeper between the United States and its European Allies . It was pointed out that France has no Government and therefore ( no Foreign Minister at the moment . She would be miffed it any meeting of:the ' Council of Foreign Ministers were held , as Russia suggested , if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . U. S.-British Trouble Hoped For Britain , while Mr. Eden is convalescing , has no Foreign Secretary other than the Prime Minister himself . But how , it is asked , would people in the United States feel if their representative , John Foster Dulles , the Secretary of State , at any such meeting took second place to Britain 's representative at the council table , especially if he held the rank of Head of State as well as Foreign Secretary ? Further , it was pointed out here that ever since there has been almost complete agreement on the body of the Austrian treaty the Russians have been blocking its final acceptance on the ground that before they agree to it finally there must be talks about the future of Trieste which , they say , is being turned into a British-American base . It is not within the competence of the deputies to discuss anything but an Austrian treaty .. Field Would Be Open to Council But once the question otAustria came before the Council of Foreign Ministers the field of discussion would be unlimited . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point by . Russia for concessions elsewhete and instead of being a. test of Russian good intentions , exemplified by good deeds , it could be exploited by the Soviet Union to test Western solidarity . In any case , a realization has , come to the officials of this country that before supping with Mr. Malenkov the West should reach for a long spoon . Not only Sir Winston in his statement about Panmunjom , but the Austrian deputies after their meeting , showed that . After saying that the new United Nations proposals on Korea had been offered after consultation with the British Commonwealth and other United Nations allies , Sir Winston , without revealing any details , said that they were " very close " to the Indian proposals endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly last December . These the bulk of British opinion endorsed and there are many people in this country who feel that ' American intransigence prevented the fruition of the sound ideas they contained about the repatriation of prisoners .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
