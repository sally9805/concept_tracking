Give pop music fans a song they can wigwag , boom or clomp to ( e.g. , Down by the Old Mill Stream , Deep in the Heart of Texas ' ) , and a national contagion is started . Last week RCA Victor had a husky little new number in the boom division called The Thing . It had sold 400,000 copies in ten days , an alltime Victor high , and was spreading like German measles . <P> The Thing had an inexorable calliope-style tune , utterly undistinguished and not even new . Charles Grean of RCA Victor 's own popular records staff had merely borrowed the tune of a Rabelaisian old ditty called The Tailor 's Boy , and given it new lyrics . The teaser : Grean 's storytelling lyrics never do specify what " the thing " is ; they just pause while Singer Phil Harris suggestively waits for three resounding booms of the bass drum . Sample : <P> 7 wandered all around the town until I chanced to meet <P> A hobo who was looking for a handout on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , he was a desperate man , <P> But when I showed him the ( boom boom-boom ) he turned around and ran. * <P> What in the world was the thing ? Pop music fans did n't care , so long as they could come in with the bass drum . <P> <P> * Copyright , 1950 , Hollis Music , Inc.
