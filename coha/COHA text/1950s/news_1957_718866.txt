txt Britain will complete its series of H-bomb tests  --  despite two successful explosions in the Pacific and notwithstanding verbal pyrotechnics set off by the Labor opposition in the House of Commons . Prime Minister Harold Macmillan held his ground on this point although he came under severe fire from the opposition front benches during question time in Parliament on June 4 . So vigorous were the critical assaults of ? socialist Aneurin Bevan against the government stand that some of those present felt the colorful Welshman might send up a tall mushroom cloud , fill the chamber with radioactivity , and sprinkle MPs and spectators with fall-out . Tests Defended But Mr. Macmillan stuck ' to his guns in defending Britain 's nuclear experiments at Christmas Island . " I feel it is our duty to complete these tests , " he said . " I , equally feel we should do everything we can to obtain by stages , by partial or complete arrangements , the maximum degree of disarmament that will bring real security to the world . " Answering Opposition Leader Hugh Gaitskell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of May 31 was " insignificant . " He thereby strengthened opinion here that Britain has developed an unusually " clean " device , producing a minimum of radioactive by-products . Mr. Gaitskell cited newspaper reports that 2,000 natural scientists in the United States have signed a petition asking for cessation of H-bomb tests . Mr. Macmillan replied that the reports " do not show that this is supported by any new evidence . " He added that new evidence was necessary before he would 1 " altogether overthrow the evidence given to me by the great ; est experts in the country , who ; serve all governments in turn . " 1 In a sharp attack . Mr. Bevan I then challenged the Prime Min ; ister to say that if proposals ; were made for a. cessation of tests , Britain would accept them . Mr. Macmillan 's rejoinder was that his government 's burden is " to see that there is a sufficient defense against aggression to prevent new wars coming ; again " ? an apparent reference to a third world war . Hope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared , despite interruptions " I shalt.not run away from my duty , nor do I intend to pill this country in a position of inferiority at the very moment when it is about to complete tests which give it a very good position . - " It is our hope and intention to see that disarmament , including nuclear disarmament , can be embarked upon , and we shall do everything we can to bring about disarmament , but not in such a way as to leave the free countries , including our own , in a hopeless position . " Mr. Bevan , reportedly almost at the point of fusion himself and ruffled by Tory taunts , at one stage warned the Conservatives not to be " so bloodthirsty . " He accused the gove'rnment of being concerned not with cessation of tests but only with their advance registration . " How many more by-elections is the party opposite going to lose before it realizes how strong is the feeling in the country ? " he challenged . Mr. Macmillan said he " deeply resented " Mr. Bevan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal clash between the two men indicate the thermal power and scorch potential which the H-bomb issue has aroused on this side of the Atlantic .
