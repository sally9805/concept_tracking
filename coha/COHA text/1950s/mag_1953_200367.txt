The Harry Dexter White case , one of the most important dramas of recent U.S. politics , reached a climax-and firm ground-last week with the testimony of Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr . and FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover before the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee . The case was not settled or ended because the basic conflict underlying it still goes on . But it had come to a point where the nation could take stock . <P> A Diversionary Tactic . The uproar began on Nov. 6 when Brownell , in a speech , told the Executives Club of Chicago : " Harry Dexter White was known to be a Communist spy by the very people who appointed him to the most sensitive and important position he ever held in Government service . " This , added Brownell , was evidence of the " persistent delusion that Communism in the Government of the U.S. was only a red herring , " and of the " blindness which inflicted the former Administration on this matter . " <P> Brownell had chosen the words " delusion " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words used in Brownell 's speech carried an implication of conscious disloyalty to the U.S. on the part of the people who appointed White . Nevertheless , the molders of the Democratic Party 's line looked at Brownell 's words and laid down a heavy smoke screen . Democratic National Chairman Stephen Mitchell cried that Brownell had accused Harry Truman of disloyalty , had " tried a former President of the United States for treason before a luncheon club . " <P> In a way that he did not mean , Mitchell got very close to the heart of the long and obscure fight over subversion in government . Men like Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and Dean Acheson knew they were loyal to the U.S.-and they knew that 99% of the people knew they were . When charged with softness toward Communism , or overconfidence in Stalin 's word , or blindness to Communist infiltration of the Government , they often reacted as if their patriotism , not their judgment , had been challenged . On a month-to-month basis , this reaction was good politics . But long range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not face the ever-mounting evidence , admit their mistakes and thus bury the issue . Mitchell 's counterblast at Brownell followed a long-established line . <P> <P> A Self-Confident Man . The story might have stayed there except for Harry Truman 's supreme confidence in himself . His first reaction to Brownell 's charge was to scoff that he did not remember ever seeing an FBI report naming White in connection with spying . But he added that " as soon as we learned he was disloyal we fired him . " <P> Again , the story might have stopped , hanging inconclusively in the partisan air . But former Secretary of State James Byrnes came forward with a highly detailed account of a painful conversation in which he urged Truman , in the light of the FBI report , to withdraw White 's name as Truman 's appointee to become U.S. director of the International Monetary Fund . Obviously , Byrnes was telling the truth , and no Democrat has since cast doubt on his story .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
