" When your self-preservation demands the accomplishment of a job , " said General Dwight Eisenhower last week to the twelve North Atlantic allies in Rome , " there is nothing that is impossible . The impossible merely becomes a difficulty , something to be solved , something to be done . " <P> The difficulty he was talking about is the creation of a European defense army , including twelve German divisions . Without the Germans , he said , " we can , in Western Europe , erect a defense that can , at least , although expensively and uneasily , produce a stalemate . But that is not enough . " <P> To be really safe and strong , Eisenhower insisted , " we need German assistance , both in geography and military strength . " <P> After hearing him out , diplomats of the twelve nations voted unanimously for the European army . But the parliaments and the peoples of the twelve nations must still be sold . Even as they voted , the NATO leaders were not at all sure they were confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belgians and the Dutch , enthusiastic at first , were now dragging their feet , reminded of old fears of German power , old mistrust of French leadership . <P> In West Germany , Socialist Kurt Schumacher , who is probably more powerful now than Christian Democrat Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , fought the European army . <P> Britain last week took the opportunity to declare itself opposed , more firmly than ever , to including its troops in the European army . ( Like the U.S. , Britain is willing to furnish troops to serve alongside the continentals . ) Winston Churchill 's stand was a reversal of the position he took as a private citizen a year ago , but no real surprise to the continental nations . They nonetheless used it as a fresh pretense for dallying . <P> The real trouble was the French . It was they who devised the European army plan in the first place , knowing that they could not defend themselves without German help but unwilling to see Germany powerful again . Reluctantly at first , the U.S. had accepted Premier Ren Pleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army divisions , but barring a German general staff , limiting the divisions ' size and armament , sprinkling them through the joint army to prevent them from homogenizing into a unified German army . To this international army France would contribute 14 divisions . <P> Two Extremes . Now that the other NATO nations had bought the Pleven plan , Pleven 's precarious government was acting as if it did not dare submit it to its own National Assembly . The two extremes of French politics , the Communists and the Gaullists , are whipping up opposition to the plan . Cried General Charles de Gaulle last week : " For centuries , our worth and weight has been identical with that of the French Army . We can not , we must not lose our army . " <P> The best French guarantee of protection against a rising Germany , and against a menacing Russia , is a strong French Army , doing its share in the common defense .
