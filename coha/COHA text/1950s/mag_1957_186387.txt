Lawyer Fidel Castro 's revolt against the regime of President Fulgencio Batista is the sort of affair that appeals more to young zealots than to common sense . Holed up in eastern Cuba 's rugged Sierra Maestra range , Castro has sniped away for three months at overwhelming army forces , and has gradually bolstered his little band of men with young revolutionaries who slipped through the army cordon to join up . Last week the identity of three recent Castro recruits came to light , to pose a touchy problem for the U.S. State Department . They were Americans , teen-age sons of U.S. Navymen stationed at the Navy 's Guantanamo Bay base near Cuba 's eastern tip . <P> The boys-Victor Buehlman , 17 , son of a commander , Charles Ryan , 17 , and Michael Garvey , 15 , both sons of petty officers-had been spending one day a week at a Cuban school , which is presumably where they picked up their sympathy for Castro . About three weeks ago they slipped away from home , eluded Cuban army patrols and reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to rebel reports , they are now uniformed , submachine gun-carrying members of the Castro band , anxious for a crack at the Batista forces and worried only that they might lose U.S. citizenship for taking up foreign arms . <P> For the rebels it was good propaganda , and the Castro underground quickly smuggled out photographs of the boys in their battle dress . But for the Cuban government and for the U.S. , which is officially friendly to Batista , it was an embarrassing affair . U.S. officials , with full cooperation from the Cuban army and police , planned to try to send an appeal from the boys ' parents into the rebel camp . If that fails , U.S. emissaries may go in under a truce flag and try to talk the young volunteers into coming out .
