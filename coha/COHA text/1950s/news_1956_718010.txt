txt A sudden wildcat strike tied up a large part of New York 's subway system during the evening rush hour yesterday , but was called off last night . Members of the Motormen 's Benevolent Association , the striking union , voted to return to work at a meeting in the Capitol Hotel . Their decision was announced at 10:30 o'clock , more than nine hours after the strike began . Strikers had already been streaming back tework for some time , and the Transit Authority bad been restoring service on various lines . It said it expected to provide normal service for this morning 's rush hour . At 2 A. M. today the authority said service on all lines was back to normal . The strike occurred on the hottest day of the year . It was the first large-scale subway strike here in thirty years , and the first one ever to affect all the city 's subway lines . More than 750,000 persons were delayed in getting home and forced to use other means of transportation , according to an unofficial estimate made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drivA by the motormen 's group , an independent union that professes to have 2,000 members , to win recognition as bargaining agent for the 3,100 motormen employed by the Transit Authority . T. W ; U. Is Bargaining Agent , The present bargaining agent for all subway employes is the Transport Workers Union , of which Michael J. Quill is international president . Stiff penalties were in sight for the strikers . In an interview at 1 A. M. today , Charles L. Patterson , chairman of the Transit Authority , branded the walkout " illegal " and promised strict enforcement of the law . He was grim and angry as he spoke . He said he considered the " instigators " of the strike to be under suspension , to be dealt with after due examination . He was certain , he said , that they . were known to the authority , although he was unable to name them immediately . For the other 400 strikers , Mr. Patterson held out this future : cOn their return to work after suspension , they will be considered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases in pay for three years from the time of rehiring. gThey will be on probation for five years , during which they will be subject to dismissal at the pleasure of the authority . ' Each man 's case will be reviewed in the near future . Mr. Patterson said the men were being taken back with " no concession . " In the event of another walkout in retdliation for the punishment , he said : " Let // them strike . We will be prepared for it . " On Wednesday the motormen 's association announced it would strike the subway lines at 12:01 next Wednesday . The Transit Authority then began training supervisory and other workers for motormen 's jobs in anticipation of a strike . Yesterday four motormen were suspended for refusing to help train supervisors . After the four were suspended , four other motormen refused to take out trains , starting the strike . The strike began about I. P. M. on the BMT lines at Coney Island and soon spread through the city to the IRT and IND lines . At its worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IND and a smaller part of the IRT . ' Theodore Loos , president of the motormen 's group , and Harris J. Klein , former member of the Transit Authority , announced the end of the strike at 10:30 . Both men had addressed the strikers at the closed meeting , urging the men to return to work . They said the 300 members present had voted unanimously ? tO return , but reporters heard some members grumbling that the decision had been a mistake . The meeting was a tumultuous one . Mr. Loos could be heard yelling " back to work , " and other . voices shouting " no , no . " Earlier Mr. Loos ' had said the men would not go back except under two conditions : recognition of their union and reinstatement of strikers without punishment . After the meeting he said no conditions had been attached to the , vote . StAkers to Be Disciplined r However , the men voted to hold another meeting next Tuesday night at Palm Gardens , Queens , to discuss the situation . Last night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the latter 's office , 280 Broadway . Immediately after the conference Mr. Loos said he was recommending that the men go back to work . Mr. Klein then sent a telegrain to Mayor Wagner . He said the motormen 's association had asked his intervention and he had urged a return to work . He asked the Mayor to see that all strikers were reinstated without being punished . ' Mayor Wagner held an emergency meeting with his top aides at City Hall for an hour and a half last night to discuss the strike . At the end of the meeting at 10:45 P. M. he anInounced that the Transit Authority would discipline employes who took part in the strike . He also said fulls police protection will be given to all motormen who returned to work . Those at the City Hall conference included Mr. Patterson and E. Vincent Curtayne , a meniher of the Transit Authority ; Police Commissioner Stephen P. Kennedy , Traffic Commissioner T. T.

U. might throw its support to the motormen . During part of the conference with the Mayor several nonstriking union leaders were present . These included Mr. Quill and others of the T. W. U. , and Morris Iueshewitz , secretary-treasurer of the New York City C. I. 0 . Council . Mr. Quill had denounced the strike as " doomed to failure . " He said it had " folded " because T. W. U. members " respected their contract " and stayed on the job . Mr. Iueshewitz said the Congress of Industrial Organization was backing the T. W. U. ' At Transit ' Authority headquarters Thomas J. , the general manager , said no amnesty had been granted the strikers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said the authority was taking back strikers but had made no deal with them . Under state law the authority can dismiss any employe who takes part in a strike . If it puts a striker back to work , it can hold him nn probation for five years , subject to dismissal . According to the Authority , 400 motormen struck and half of them had returned to work by 11 P.M. All strikers had been suspended , but they were being put back to work subject to determination whether they had walked out of their own free will or had been " threatened and coerced " into joining the ' strike . It was indicated there would be leniency toward any who , had struck under coercion . Mr ' .

It T.W.ed assurances from the " ' W U. that its men would work overtime if necessary to keep trains running if there was a recurrence of the ' motormen 's strike . During the rush-hour peak of the strike , crowds of stranded riders jammed the subway stations at Times Square and other busy areas : ' Railroad trains , ferries and buses were crowded with homegoers . Extra buses were put in service . Cabs were at a premium . Automobiles carried extra passengers . Many persons walked across the Brooklyn and Queensboro Bridges . Telephone lines were tied up by persons phoning they would be late getting home . Nonstrikers Offer to Work Nonstriking motormen offered to man subway trains last night if they were guaranteed adequate police protection . Police Commissioner Kennedy asserted that if necessary city policemen ' would be put on all trains that ran .

The police were unable to say whether sabotage was involved . Power was restored at 8:10 P. M. Mr. Loos , president of the motormen 's group , defended the strike in the following state-ment : " This stoppage was a spontaneous reaction of outraged men against the operation of trains by dispatchers who had not operated trains for years . The men told me that they were amazed at the fact that trains carrying thousands of passengers were in the hands of these Men . They protested against this situation-and were ignored . The only way they could bring this to the public 's attention before a major . catastrophe like the Malhone Street wreck was to take this action . " The Transit Authority is not directly responsible - to the Mayor . Created by law in 1953 , it took over the city 's deficitburdened transit system last year . Its income now must meet operating costs , although city taxpayers can continue to pay , for huge capital outlays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve staggered six-year terms . One member is appointed by the Mayor , another by the Governor and a third , the chairman , is named by his fellow board members : The members can be removed only after public hearing by the ' ' appointing officials .
