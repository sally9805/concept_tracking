A pastoral letter from a Roman Catholic cardinal kicked up a flurry of feeling last week over the sensitive subject of Protestant-Catholic relations . Chicago 's Cardinal Archbishop , Samuel Stritch , 66 , sent out a carefully worded communication to all Roman Catholic churches in Illinois . Its gist : Catholics should not participate , even as observers , in the Assembly of the World Council of Churches at Evanston , Ill. , Aug. 15-31 . <P> " There are men outside the church , " wrote the cardinal , " professing the Christian name , who deplore the divisions which exist among them . They talk about setting up and establishing a Christian unity , or , as they sometimes say , a unity of Christian action . . . They gather in international organizations ; they hold congresses , conventions and assemblies . . . <P> " The Catholic Church does not . . . <P> enter into any organization in which the delegates of many sects sit down in council or conference as equals to discuss the nature of the Church of Christ or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program of united Christian action . She does not allow her children to engage in any activity . . . based on the false assumption that Roman Catholics , too , are still searching for the truth of Christ . " " Negative &; Defensive . " The cardinal 's letter raised some Protestant eyebrows . It seemed to leaders of the World Council to be a reversal of earlier positions assumed by European Catholics and the Vatican itself . " For the absence of a bitter or aggressive spirit from the cardinal 's letter , we may all be thankful , " said World Council Secretary W. A. Visser ' t Hooft in a prepared reply . But he expressed surprise that Stritch had not referred " to the official instruction issued by the Vatican on Dec. 20 , 1949 , which . . . left the door open for certain conversations between Roman Catholics and non-Roman Catholics ... in ecumenical gatherings , if the necessary ecclesiastical authorization had been given . " Catholics themselves , said Visser ' t Hooft , had hailed the Vatican directive as an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defensive position ... It was on the basis of this instruction from the Vatican that a small group of Roman Catholic observers . . . attended the World Council 's Faith and Order Conference in Lund , Sweden , in 1952 . " <P> A Step Backward . From Editor Peter Day of the high Episcopal weekly , the Living Church , came a tarter comment : " It is unfortunate that the Roman Catholic hierarchy of the U.S. is so exceedingly gingerly about contacts with their fellow Christians . " More outspoken was the Christian Century , which this week discussed the Stritch letter in an editorial titled " The Gulf . " <P> " This pastoral letter ... is a document of great importance . . . We do not recall another Roman Church document addressed primarily to Americans which equals this in its aggressive declaration of the papal claims , " said the Century . Perhaps , it added , it indicates that the Vatican is beginning to " view with alarm the growing strength of the ecumenical movement . There was no such cracking of the disciplinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . The Roman Catholic Bishop of Geneva went out of his way to express his good will . . . and the Catholic bishops in Holland approved prayers for its success . . .
