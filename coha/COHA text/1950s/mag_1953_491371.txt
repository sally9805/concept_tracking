THIS is the season for speculating on who will he the most influential men in the new Administration , who will be " closest " to the 2 White House , who will " have the car " of the President . It is an entertaining pastime , and about as tricky as picking winners in a county-fair horse race . Favorites sometimes stumble , and unknowns dash unaccountably from the ruck . The wiseacres of 1861 , for instance , were acre that Secretary of State Seward would not only be tho class of the Cabinet but would really lead the Government , with Honest Abe as a sort of rustic nutscot . Seward himself shared this belief until Lincoln , gently but firmly , reined him in . President Harding headed his Cabinet with such strong figures t as Herbert Hoover , Andrew Mellon and Charles Evans Hughes . It was hailed as government by the best minds . But the muddera with the worst morals moved up fast on the inside , splattering poor Harding beyond historical cleansing . In the beginnings of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Hugh ( Blue Eagle ) Johnson and ? Prof. Raymond Moley ? how bravely they galloped , how swiftly they fell . And it was only six years ago that Jimmy Byrnes , leading the Cabinet pack as Mr. Truman 's trusted favorite and Secretary of State , suddenly disappeared from the course . He next came to view in a distant pasture , as governor of South Carolina , neighing hostilely . Such are the perils of prognostication , but speculation on the balance of power around the President is inevitable , and legitimate . The kind of men a President most trusts and leans upon is a matter of intense and proper interest to the public . Right now , as a new era begins with President Eisenhower 's inauguration , such interest and speculation are nt a new high . Much of this cogitation centers , curiously enough , about the hitherto rather obscure position of " Assistant to the President . " The job does not carry official Cabinet rank ; it does not compare in its outward power and status to such a post as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Steelman , who occupied this position under Truman , l7 flurry Perkins , a suit , 1i-11-and-game guide , with his governor at Shus.to , . a P 1 , Freedom , N. H. leave much impression on events or the public mind . Hut when General Eisenhower announced that Sherman Adams , just now retiring after his second term as governor of New Hampshire , would serve him as Assistant to the President , the political reporters and experts at once sat up and took notice . James Reaton , of The New York Times , wrote that Adams " may very well turn out to be more powerful than any member of the new Republican Cabinet . " Edward T. Folliard , of the Washington Post , hazarded a similar opinion . Political Columnist Doris Fleeson spoke of Eisenhower 's " evident intention to make his most trusted adviser , Governor Adams , a genuine Assistant President . " And Columnist Thomas L. Stokes saw Adams as becoming " really a second President , in effect , from the administrative tan d po in t " Thane hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ? until now ? nebulous office of Assistant to the President . They are based rather on ( 1 ) the way Eisenhower has run other major joist he has held in the past , and ( 2 ) the personal relationship which has developed between Eisenhower and Sherman Adams during the lust six months . It has beam Eisenhower 's custom , in tasks of great administrative complexity , to make full and skillful time of the chief-id-staff principle , choosing for this poet a man so able , reliable and compatible that he can be entrusted with broad authority . He seems to have a rare and almost intuitive talent for picking such aides . On that very day , June 15 , 1942. when he first received word that he would he the American commander in Europe , Eisenhower selected as his chief of staff Walter Bedell Smith  --  a choice so sound that General Smith remained his good right hand through all the vicissitudes of war until after V-E Day . And when Ike went back to Europe two years ago to organize and build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another brilliant selection in the person of Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther . Though " chief of staff " is a military term , the principle is familiar to every executive who chooses a trusted man to share his administrative burdens . The speculation on the importance of Sherman Adams ' new job rests on the assumption that Eisenhower will continue to follow his familiar chiefof-stall method , and that Adams will he the man . This remains an assumption , but there are many evidences to support it as we look back over recent events . In the summer of 1951 Adams was serving his second term as Republican governor of New Hampshire . Ile was known for his strong character , driving energy and tough integrity . He had served in the marines in World War I , graduated from Dartmouth in 1920 , and then , because of his liking for the outdoors , had taken a job as a scaler in a logging camp . The lumberjack life appealed to him and he stayed with it , moving up steadily through the ranks to an executive position with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timberland and lumber operations . He never touched politic until he was past forty . Then , at the urging of friends , he ran for the legislature as a Republican in a Democratic constituency . He won easily , and , once in politics , shot up quickly : Speaker of the House in the state legislalure , member of Congress and then governor of t slate . Aa governor he at once tackled the prick ! mill long-overdue problem of streamlining the a i  --  pie machinery of the state government , followin principles similar to those outlined for the Natio Government in the Hoover Report . His program went through , despite opposition , mainly because Adams was able to arome the interest and enlist the support of the general public . In this , and in many of his other vigorous actions as governor , Adams accumulated some influential enemies  --  a situation which was later to have a surprising effect on General Eisenhower 's presidential candidacy . In that summer of 1951 the governor was not personally acquainted with General Eisenhower , and it is doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long been an admirer of the general , and now , watching developments in Wash . ington and the world , he became convinced that Eisenhower was the only man who could throw out the deeply entrenched Democratic regime and give us the kind of presidential leadership which the continuing crisis demanded . At this time there was much public enthusiasm for Eisenhower , but it lacked substance and focus , while the Taft forces already had their candidate , their plan and their workers in the field . Such was the situation when Sherman Adams , at summer 's end , went to the annual conference of state governors at Gatlinburg , Tennessee . Among the Republican governors present there was strong sentiment for Eisenhower  --  more , indeed , than for Taft . But the general was far away in Paris , and there was serious uncertainty about how , or whether , he would become an actual candidate . AU the pro-Eisenhower talk of 1948 , it was recalled , had come to nothing . The governors naturally disliked the possibility of backing a nonstarter . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gatlintinrg , in his brief , crisp way , that Eisenhower 's name would be entered in the New Hampshire presidential primary to be held the following March . " My opinion is , " he added , " that the general will not withdraw . " Though it was only an opinion , Adams ' manner carried conviction to those present , and the future was to prove him right . He saw New Hampshire as the best strategic spot to launch the Eisenhower campaign . It was the tine state scheduled to hold a primary election ; Ike 's name could be entered by petition without consent on his part ; and a popular victory there would give his candidacy a momentum which the general would find it hard to resist . Also , Adams ' assurance gave Ike 's supporters everywhere something definite to catch hold of . The bands were already tuning up for Ike ; Adams ' announcement provided a bandwagon to ride on , with a visible initial goal . As it turned out , a strange sequence of events gave the New Hampshire primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also became the scene of Senator Talea first serious political miscalculation  --  in which he was encouraged by the enthusiasm of Adams ' enemies . It is a familiar maneuver , in a campaign for the presidential nomination , for a candidate to stay out of a state where he knows his opponent will win . It seemed at first that this might be Taft 's attitude toward New Hampshire . Here was one state where Governor Adams ' early leadership had given the Eisenhower forces a head start . If Taft let it go by default or put up only a token resistance , his followers could easily minimize the setback by pointing out that the senator , busy with his campaign in the big key states , could hardly be expected to take time out to stump little New Hampshire for a measly fourteen delegates . Last January , Taft was still apparently undecided whether to make a fight of it in New Hampshire . When I visited the state at that time I noticed two distinct elements in the Taft backing . One was his usual loyal core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but vociferous group whose mainanimal seemed anti-Adams rather than anti-Eisenhower . These latter were men offended by Adams ' Stern policies as governor , eager to get back at him , and therefore most anxious to draw Taft into the fight . As one of them said to me , " if we can get Bob Taft in here with both feet , we can give Adams a shellacking . " " You mean beat Eisenhower ? " I asked . " Well  --  yes , " he said . " And teach Adams a lesson . " About this time Taft sent two trusted emissaries into New Hampshire to look over the ground . Among those they consulted were the anti-Adams men whose emotions had run away with their political judgment . Their misguided ardor helped convince the Taft lieutenants that if the senator made a real fight in New Hampshire , he could stop the Eisenhower boom in its tracks . Taft did make an all-out campaign , and the result was a fine example of the reverse twist in politics . For when Taft swept into New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept in with him . As the contest hit the front pages and the air waves , what had been a preliminary skirmish took on the aspect of a crucial battle . The large crowds that turned out to see Taft gave drama to the campaign , and a further element of suspense was added when the political soothsayers ? underestimating Ike 's strength as they were to do again in November ? predicted a close race . By primary day , March eleventh , the eyes of the whole nation were on New Hampshire . Consequently when the returns came in showing Eisenhower , is absentia , winning by a wide popular margin over Taft , and capturing all fourteen delegates , the impact was power ( ul . The result removed the doubts about Ike 's candidacy , gave his late-starting campaign just the boost it sorely needed , and fired his supporters with the extra spirit required to cut down Taft 's early organizational lead . When we look back on the Republican Convention . and recall how closely the Eisenhower vs . Taft lines were drawn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hampshire victory . Governor Adams came out of it with enhanced prestige and the beginnings of a national reputation . The skill and unflustered confidence with which he countered the Taft invasion impressed political observers . To some of the visiting press from the big cities , however . Adams was a bit of a puzzle . He did not seem sufficiently haired up about this momentous contest . Actually Adams was in closer touch with the popular sentiment of his state than were Taft 's advisers . After the New Hampshire primary Adams moved somewhat into the background . He continued to work hard and quietly for Ike , but he was not one of the conspicuous Eisenhower leaders . He did not make the pilgrimage to Paris , nor was he among those who met the general when he ? returned to America at the beginning of June . He was not on hand.that inauspicious evening when Ike 's speaking campaign got olf to a ( Coot ' el on rage 42 ) faltering start with his florin-drenched television appearance in Abilene . But five weeks later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously chose Adams nif Ike 's floor lender at the convention . This was partly a tribute to Adams ' judgment and character , partly a recognition of the fact that he had no commitments to any group or fact ion . Ast he convention got under way , Adams was engrossed every waking hour in the feverish struggle at the convention hall , and had no chance to see the chief whom he represented . But the general , in his headquarters at the Blackstone Hotel , was able meantime to learn much about Adams . The general is a connoisseur of battle reports , and those which came through from Adams , on the apparently confused melee of the convention , were to his liking : incisive , realistic and to the point . He also noted Adams ' extraordinary physical and nervous endurance , and his coolness under stress . It was not until Eisenhower 's nomination was assured , and he met with his lieutenants to plan the windup of the convention , that he and Adams had any real opportunity to make each other 's personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a mutual friend recalls . " They seemed to understand each other at once  --  it was like a chemical affinity . " Despite this cordial relationship , Governor Adams left Chicago without any expectation of playing a further prominent part in the campaign , except in his own state of New Hampshire . Before returning home , he went to Wyoming for a short rest . One day he received a telephone call from the mountain camp in Colorado where Ike was relaxing with a week of fishing and cooking . The general was on the wire . How about Adams putting everything else aside and coming along with Eisenhower as a sort of right-hand man and chief campaign adviser ? Adams pointed out that his term as governor would not expire until January , but Ike was persuasive . Adams flew back to New Hampshire to look over the situation . The main tasks of his two-term administration had been completed ; his gubernatorial duties for the next three months would be routine . He took a leave of absence without pay until election time , and reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the first there was some doubt as to Adams ' exact title . He was variously called chief adviser and personal campaign manager . Some reporters referred to him as Ike 's " chief of staff " and ? since this term was never used in the official announcements ? it has been stated that it was an invention of the press . This is incorrect . In late July , in conversation with a friend , Eisenhower said , " I think of Adams as my chief of staff , but I do n't call him that because the politicians think it sounds too military . " As such , Adams was at Eisenhower 's side during the long ordeal of the campaign , including some ? 10,000 miles of travel by train and plane . The fatigue , the recurrent crises , the sheer physical crowding of such an experience puts a hard test on friendship , but the regard between Eisenhower and Adams seemed to flourish rather than diminish under the strain . The two men had some differentices ? a chief of staff who failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they had no disagreement on fundamentals . After the elect ion Eisenhower confided to an associate that his affection for Adams and his respect for his good judgment had continued to grow with closer acquaintance . Many predicted that Adams would be appointed to a Cabinet post . But this would have absorbed his main energies in the administration of a Government department . The fact that Eisenhower picked him as his Assistant to the President , with offices in the White House itself , seems to confirm the assumption that Eisenhower still thinks of Adams as his chief of staff , with all which that implies . Some commentators , using this assumption as a springboard , leap to the further conclusion that Adams will be to Eisenhower " what Colonel House was to Woodrow Wilson , " or " what Harry Hopkins was to Franklin Roosevelt . " The analogy strikes me as cockeyed . House and Hopkins , though quite different from each other , shared a certain taste for the mysterious , a talent for the ingrown diplomacy or intrigue which often surrounds the centers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent ; his whole life has been characterized by direct action , forthrightness , and frequently by a bluntness verging on the tactless . He could n't play the part of a dime-store Rasputin if he tried . Again , though House and Hopkins had some notable abilities of their own , they were parasitical in the sense that they drew their strength , like vines , from their patron Presidential tree . Sherman Adams , like Bedell Smith and Al Gruenther before him , is quite s sturdy tree in his own right . Adams is a " new " Republican in the sense that his mind is fixed on the present and future , rather than on nostalgic memories of the McKinley and Coolidge eras . He is not a theorist or " radical . " He has no pet schemes of government to foist on his chief . I gather that his general ideas on American policy , domestic and foreign , look in the same direction as Eisenhower 's own . He is not in the White House to pull the President this way or that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chosen path . " Adams ' job is to add four hours to the President 's day , " said a mutual friend ? " four hours in which Ike can work on his really major decisions . " One of Adams ' first and hardest Ulrike will be to bring some order , co ordination and clarity of communications into the donne forest of executive agencies which has grown up around the White House in recent years . Eisenhower has already appointed a special committee , made up of Nelson Rockefeller , Dr. Arthur Flemming and Dr. Milton Eisenhower , to work with Adams on this , and he will also have available an expert study mode during the Inst nine months by the National Planning Association . Sherman Adams is an old woodsman , and will need all his craft . If he can chart this forest of executive agencies , clean out the underbrush , establish clear trails and well-placed signal towers , and thus reduce the wilderness to comprehensible human control , he will have nerved the President and the country well . If there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about curiously these days as they look over the new Assistant to the President . For Sherman Adams is the young country cousin , so to speak , of the famous old Massachusetts family which gave us two Presidents of the United States , not to mention various Cabinet members , ambassadors and Revolutionary notables . Like John Adams , the first President ever actually to live in the White House , and his son , President John Quincy Adams , Sherman is directly descended from the Henry Adams who , in the 1630 's , came from England and settled in Braintree , Massachusetts . Sherman 's branch of the family , about 1830 , moved to Vermont . There , farming the rugged soil or pursuing their modest careers as merchants , teachers or preachers , they were lost to history 's eye . Sherman Adams was born January 8 , 1899 , in the village parsonage of his maternal Grandfather Sherman , in East Dover , Vermont . The father , Clyde , was a farmer ; the mother , Winnie Marion ( Sherman ) Adams , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three years later , not so long after the birth of Sherman 's sister , Marion , the little family moved to Providence , Rhode Island . The marriage did not thrive in the atmosphere of the city . The parents were separated , and the father went his own way . This Left the mother and two small children in a difficult situation , which might have become forlorn except for the affectionate guardianship of Mrs. Adams ' brother , Edwin F. Sherman , a Providence merchant , who not only lent a helping hand but became like a second father to the youngsters . ( continued on Page .17 ) ( Coutittned from Pune .12 ) Young Sherman went to the public schools in Providence . In the Hummere he lived ? and worked  --  on his Grandfather Sherman 's farm in Vermont . Here ho began to develop his unusually wiry physique and his love for the northern woods and countryside . He devoured the works of James Fenimore Cooper . The boy was extremely fond of his grandfather , and probably much influenced by him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stern ethical principle . In Providence he was a good student . Outwardly serious , he had an inner sense of prankish fun that delighted his companions and sometimes dismayed his teachers . In a pinch he applied himself to his books with such will and concentration that he soon set things right . To his mother 's delight , young Sherman shared her taste for music , and had an excellent natural voice . He loved to sing , and still dour . Until his voice changed . he was an angel-faced star in the boys ' choir at St. Stephen 's Church in Providence . Later his voice developed into a bass of unusual depth and quality . ( One night last fall , in a Midwest railroad yard , I heard voices raised in song . I traced it to the Eisenhower section of the parked campaign train . One rich bass voice led all the rest : that was Sherman Adams , during one of the rare momenta of relaxation in the long campaign grind . ) In high school he won top honors in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an instinct for the right word and a sharp logic which cut to the heart of nn argument . Adams apparently paid little attention to this youthful talent of his , but it revived when chance carried him into politics a quarter century later . In the fall of 1916 , with help from his uncle , supplemented by money earned during vacations , Sherman went to Dartmouth , which he chose partly because it was up near the White Mountain country . He took at once to the activities of the Dartmouth Outing Club , famed for its Winter Carnival , for skiing , hiking and mountain climbing . In the summers he worked as a trail cutter for the Appalachian Mountain Club . By the time he was a sophomore he was noted as a woodsman , and was nicknamed the Old Man of the Mountains . He was only five feet seven and weighed less than 140 , but his spare frame seemed immune to fatigue . He thought nothing of hiking thirty or forty miles a day through rough country . He seemed actually to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted in 1918 , chose the marines . He is said to he one of the few men who ever breezed through the notorious physical rigors of marine training without batting an eye . His advance training as a machine gunner was terminated by the Armistice , and he returned to college . By senior year he was one of the " big men " of the campus : president of the Outing Club , leader of the rioted arid far-ranging Dartmouth Glee Club . chairman of the committee on student vacation jobs , and a member of Pnlneopituti , the governing group of the student body . In his studies he had moved up to honor grades . He was popular and respected , but his humor sometimes had a caustic edge , and he showed none of the backslapping tendencies of the college politician . In the spring of 1920 one of those strange student , crazes hit the far-north colleges . The boys trained , suffered and knocked themselves out to see who could hike the farthest in twenty-four hours . Records were established at fifty miles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mountains , decided to have a whirl at it . He and another champion hiker , William P. Fowler , set out at midnight from Skyline Farm to walk to Hanover . Checked on by observers stationed along the way , and fueled by relays of food and water carriers , Adams and Fowler hobbled into Hanover that evening at thirteen minutes of twelve ? a measured 83 miles . The record has never been equaled over comparubly rough and hilly country . The feat itself was unimportant , but it is an interesting example of Adams ' powers of endurance and will . As a friend says , " Sherman has always been a never-say-die fellow . " He has a certain Spartan  --  or maybe it is just old Puritan  --  quality . When he sets out to do something he is apparently indifferent to discomfort , hardship or fatigue . If it is worth doing , it is worth doing not merely well but to one 's utmost strength . He is inclined to expect . a similar all-out spirit among his associates , which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lumberjacks called him " a tough little hombre , " and some politicians consider him downright brutal . His unconcealed contempt for slackness , whether of effort or ethics  --  tendencies not unknown in the political fraternity  --  has hurt feelings and made some of the enemies hitherto mentioned . Nor is Adams amenable to time-honored political customs . One day a delegation was visiting the State House to put a little heat on Governor Adams . The chairman started off with the traditional threat-and-promise gambit . " We represent . " he intoned , " more than 30.000 votes for governor . " Governor Adams broke in . " Who the hell , " he inquired , " wants to be governor ? " Nobody could think up an answer to this question . It upset the scenario , and was considered an unfair breach of political etiquette . Aboard the Eisenhower special train Adams was nicknamed " the Rock . " It happened this way . As in all such campaigns , powerful forces tried to drag the candidate this way or that . Unable , or afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him by putting the pressure on Adams . He simply would not pressure . He kept his temper and remained outwardly calm , but if the goading became too persistent his blue eyes mind square-jawed features seemed to freeze into a stony coldness . Adams ' friend and sidekick , Sen. Fred Seaton , of Nebraska , observing this phenomenon , was reminded of the Great Stone Face of New Hampshire , a wonder of nature which happens to he just a few miles from Adams ' home in Lincoln . This was later shortened to " the Rock . " Subsequently the governor 's petite . charming and witty wife , who aaccompaniedhim on the trip , was nicknamed the Pebble " ? presumably , she said , sVf1.1111 ) .11 ' " 1.10C1111/44 .

It is seen in his fond new ? almost a passion  --  for the beauty of the mountain country . ( He has a maxim , which he now must violate : " Never live south of Plymouth . " i His love of music I have mentioned . When he comes home after a hard day lie relaxes by playing records from his extensive classical collection . And at night , when he hue a hard problem to wrestle with or a difficult speech to write , he likes to work to the accompaniment of II Mozart symphony or a Bach fugue . In the 1920 's , prominent college graduates found a ready upward lift in office jobs in the big cities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something of logging operations in his mountain roamings . The ruggedness of the life appealed to his Spartan side ; the beauty of the country pleased his artistic side . He went north to the lumber companies . He rejected a proffered job as suilesman and went to work in a logging camp as a scaler . The illness of a foreman gave him his first chance to try his leadership among the lumberjacks , who are not a soft breed of men . He was a flyweight among heavies , but be could outpace them in the woods , he was afraid of nothing , he talked and acted straight , and there was a look in his eye which discouraged monkey businew . Work in a logging camp subjects a man to a searching scrutiny by his fellows . Front , pretense and blather are stripped away , and the basic human character is assayed . The lumberjacks liked the " tough little hombre , " and their liking grew through the years .

In the foreground it depicts Adams , the young woodsman , with his ex ; rising in the background are the Franconia Notch , the Great Stone Face and the dome of the state capitol . Below are carved the words , " To Sherm from his friends the lumberjacks . " As Adams moved up toward executive position he acquired an all-around training in the lumber business . He was treasurer of the Black River Lumber Company ; he set up and managed a furniture-stock factory ; he became an expert " cruiser " ? one who appraises the quantity , quality and value of timber on tracts about to be purchased  --  a job in which faulty judgment is quickly discovered ; he was made manager of timberlands for Parker-Young 's ; he studied the manufacture of paper pulp and paper ; he became a director of the local hank and local railroad .

F.VENI PLIS1 ' It 's n rough business+ , and Adams had his share of close calls . Logs were being rolled on a river landing when a skid flew up , hit . Adams in the face and knocked out his front teeth . A home kicked him between the eyes , knocked him unconscious and fractured the frontal sinus . A piece of maple butt , shooting from a spout , took him behind the ear and left him partially deaf on the loft side . In those days , when the ice broke in spring , the logs were floated , or " driven . " down the river . Adams , like his companions , thought nothing of plunging into the icy water to break a log jam . " Was n't that dangerous ? " I recently asked Ed Gilman , one of Adams ' old logging friends . " Not very , " he Raid . " We only drowned a couple of fellers . " Adams was broken in as timberlands manager by Harry Ronan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his practical judgment , driving energy and insistence on " results , not excuses . " Not long ago I talked with Mr. Ronan , now retired in Plymouth . and asked him what he thought . of Adams . " Well , " he said , " I had Sherm under me three years . and I never found a weak spot in him . " As timberlands manager Adams had charge , among other things , of dozens of lumber camps and 500 to 1000 lumberjacks . This may give some clue to the almost instinctive liking and understanding between Adams and General Eisenhower . For the command of men arrayed against the brutal forces of a northern winter ? its subzero cold , its howling snows , its sudden floods ? is not unlike a military operation . It breeds steadiness , straight thinking , and a realization of the implacable forces and dangers of this world . It was a force of nature , in a sense , which carried Adams into politics . In 1938 he was one of the rising men in the lumber business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily married ; he loved his four fine children and his quiet home near the mountains ; he was content . Then came the terrific hurricane of that fall , cutting a wide swath across the forests of New Hampshire . Not only was there great property ' low ; the fallen trees created a dreadful fire hazard . " That was the year , " friends recall , " that Sherm quit smoking . " He became a leader in the state-wide effort to clear up and salvage the stricken timber . This required public understanding and co-operation . ..... 21. 1953 Adams traveled about , addressed meetings , preached the doctrine of ( salvage . His talent for public speaking , dormant since high-school days , flowered anew . Those who saw him in action knew ho would be a natural in politics . In 1940 some of his close friends in Lincoln , dissatisfied with their representation in the legislature , urged him to run . Half amusedly , he agreed . It may have taken a hurricane to blow Adams into politics , but once in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does asserted itself . And as he worked at it ho became fascinated  --  not only with politics but with the possibilities of better government . He had long been a student of American history , biography and the Federalist papers . Nnw he brought his knowledge up to date and began to apply it with his usual fierce energy . How fast he rose you know , and when he reached the executive chair in the state house he became  --  in the view of the thinking public if not of all the politicians  --  one of the beat governors in recent memory . Mr. and Mrs. Adams are still not fully accustomed to the strange ways of politics  --  even of the quiet New Hampshire style  --  and they found the tremendous excitement and whoop . de-do of the presidential campaign a hit overwhelming . They like the quiet of the country and the privacy of their home . The close quarters of the campaign trains and hotels , the surging crowds , the blaring bands , the equate bles and antics of some of the hangerson  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a strain . They stood it nobly until the morning of Election Day . Then , while the refit of the Eisenhower staff milled about in the headquarters at the Commodore , biting their nails and feverishly juggling electoral possibilities , Shermap and Rachel Adams quietly slipped away and spent the day at the Bronx Zoo . Every now and then there was a cry , " Where 's the Rock ? " or " Where 's the Pebble ? " Nobody knew . When the Adamses finally showed up again that evening former Sen. Sinclair Weeks  --  who is to be the new Secretary of Commerce  --  complimented Mrs Adams on her fresh outdoor coloring and asked where she had been . " We 've been to the zoo to see all the animals , " she said . " Ah ! Quite a change from the campaign , " said Mr. Weeks . " Not so much , " said the Pebble demurely .
