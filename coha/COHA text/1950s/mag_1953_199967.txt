In 1949 , under the leadership of the U.S. , the world 's biggest wheat exporter , 46 nations signed the first International Wheat Agreement . A big world surplus was keeping wheat prices low , and it seemed both good international policy and smart business to set fixed prices for world wheat sales . Roughly , the agreement protected importing nations by giving them the right to buy fixed quotas of wheat at a ceiling price of $1.80 a bushel . Exporters were protected by a floor of $1.50 a bushel ( later reduced to $1.20 ) . Everybody seemed taken care of . <P> But the signers of the agreement turned out to be poor guessers . The war in Korea sent prices skyrocketing far above the $1.80-a-bushel ceiling . To fulfill its commitments , the Federal Government had to pay U.S. wheat exporters a subsidy averaging 62 a bushel-the difference between the export price and the U.S. market price . The agreement , when it expires next July , will have cost the U.S. almost $600 million in subsidies , which are now running at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Washington , the U.S. again took the lead in agreeing to a new wheat pact , which will guarantee it exports of 270 million bushels . For Agriculture Secretary Ezra Benson , who believes that international price-fixing is fundamentally wrong , it was a distasteful assignment . But withdrawal by the U.S. would have been taken as a sign of repudiation of U.S. pledges of world economic cooperation , and would have provided Russia with a potent propaganda weapon sure to be used . <P> <P> In the new agreement , the U.S. tried to get the ceiling lifted to $2.50 a bushel and the floor price to $1.90 . After months of bargaining , most of the member nations agreed to a compromise of a $2.05 maximum and a $1.55 minimum . But Britain , as the biggest wheat importer , insisted that it could not go higher than $2 a bushel , and refused to sign . Perhaps it thought it could strike a better bargain with Argentina , which has a wheat surplus and has never joined the pact . <P> But the agreement could still go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance that it would . Wheat prices are again falling , after the biggest bread-grain crop in world history last year . The U.S. is also facing a glut at home . Last week the Agriculture Department upped its forecast for the winter wheat crop 17% . It looked as though 1953-5 crop , though no record , would be big enough to force Benson to impose acreage allotments and marketing quotas in 1954 . <P> Under the new terms , U.S. subsidies will be cut to 31 a bushel-still painful enough to raise howls in the Senate , which must ratify the pact . But finding a market for the U.S. wheat surplus might well be even more costly without any agreement , since other countries might dump wheat at prices far below the proposed floor prices .
