" The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain , " Bernard Shaw has his madeover Liza Doolittle triumphantly recite in his film Pygmalion , thus inadvertently giving modern literature its one memorable line characterizing the equable climate of the Iberian Peninsula . But there was nothing temperate about February 's weather in Spain . The cold wave which had paralyzed southern Europe swept down over the Pyrenees and deposited a blanket of frost which chilled to the bone millions of lightly dressed Spaniards living in unheated homes and , far worse , ruined the crops on hundreds of thousands of olive , almond and citrus trees . Hardest hit was Valencia , where the thermometer registered an all-time low of 16 , and some 400,000 tons of oranges were frozen into balls of ice as they hung on the trees . Surveying the damage last week , Spanish syndicates estimated a loss of $50 million in citrus exports and a $75 million loss in olive oil production , the two most essential ingredients in Spain 's precarious economy .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
