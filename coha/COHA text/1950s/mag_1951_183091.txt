Hollywood , which often complains that U.S. movie critics are unnecessarily harsh , was asked last week to take a look at a copy of a movie magazine called Film India , picked up by Producer Ken McEl-downey while making a film in India . One review is headlined : " Jugnu-a Dirty , Disgusting , Vulgar Picture . " Sample text : " The entire affair is damn stupid and annoying . As for the players , Nur Jehan makes an utter fool of herself as ... the college girl . . . Her fat face refuses to move , and her song gestures provoke only revulsion and ridicule. "
