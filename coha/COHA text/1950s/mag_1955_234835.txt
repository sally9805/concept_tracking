THE CAPTAIN LEAVES HIS SHIP ( 313 pp. ) - Jan Cwiklinski , as told to Hawthorne Daniel-Doubleday ( $4 ) . <P> History can sneak up on a man when his back is turned . Captain Cwiklinski , master of the Polish passenger liner Batory , was not looking one May day in Manhattan six years ago , when a baldish little man with glasses came aboard on a 25 visitor 's ticket and sailed as a stowaway . Unlike most stowaways , he soon dug first-class passage money from his pocket . He also owned up to the name of Gerhart Eisler . For unwittingly aiding in the escape of a key Communist agent , badly wanted in the U.S. , Captain Cwiklinski got involved in a nasty , three-cushion carom on the international billiard table . <P> The captain neither agreed nor resisted when Scotland Yard men took Eisler off the Batory at Southampton . For this , when he docked at Gdynia , Cwiklinski sat through a palm-sweating grilling with his bosses and the dreaded U.B . ( for Urzad Bezpieczenstwa ) , Poland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Batory 's crew and passengers were in turn grilled by U.S. Government agents , and the eventual loss of pier privileges forced the Poles to give up the transatlantic run . No Communist or proCommunist , Cwiklinski tried to coexist with the Polish satellite regime for the sake of his wife and two children . He gradually became a figurehead on his own ship , with all disciplinary matters handled by secret-police men . In 1953 , tipped off by a friend that he was slated for a phony spy trial , the captain jumped ship in England and began writing his experiences . <P> His autobiography is a story without surprises , but still a sobering account of the Communist tyranny as only those who have lived under it can know it . <P> <P> * Two weeks later Eisler was released and made his way to East Germany , where he was propaganda boss until he lost favor in 1952 . He now heads an East German version of the Gallup poll .               @ @ @ @ @ @
