SENATOR JOE MCCARTHY ( 280 pp. ) - Richard Rovere-Harcourt , Brace ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> " A man of loose tongue , intemperate , trusting to tumult , leading the populace to mischief with empty words . " That is how Euripides described the typical demagogue , and that is also how Reporter Richard Rovere sees the subject of his biography . Yet it is a measure of McCarthy 's defeat that , only two years after his death , it takes an effort of the imagination to recall the shifty but haunted eyes , the spurious rhetoric , the rasping voice ( " Mr. Chairman . Mr. Chairman ! Point of order ! " ) that could not be halted by the gavel of reason . The allusion to Euripides should not keep one from remembering that , while there was tragedy in the McCarthy era. there was comedy , too . Rovere recalls that Brooks Atkinson once blamed McCarthyism for a bad Broadway season and that a noted rabbi held the Senator 's influence responsible for panty raids on college dormitories . <P> These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among McCarthy 's foes as among his followers . In a remarkably well-balanced and even-tempered book . Author Rovere ( for the past eleven years Washington correspondent for The New Yorker ) notes that " McCarthyism was a bipartisan doctrine . " He blames not only some Republicans for tolerating Joe so long but some Democrats ( notably Senators Paul Douglas and John Kennedy ) for not speaking out against him . Rovere might have added that those who did speak out against McCarthy sometimes helped him by exaggerating his importance . To Rovere himself . McCarthy remains " in many ways the most gifted demagogue " in U.S. history , with a terribly sure " access to the dark places of the American mind . " But he was no totalitarian , not even a reactionary ; he was a nihilist , " a revolutionist without any revolutionary vision . " Anything but a conformist , he attacked the Army , the Protestant clergy , the press , the two major parties . He was , says Rovere , ' ' closer to the hipster than to the Organization Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforced by the physical picture-his lumbering bonhomie , his carefully cultivated 5 o'clock shadow , his habit of lying disheveled on floor or sofa , an attitude he liked to assume for photographers . " He belched in public , " notes Rovere rather primly and adds : " He had the perverse appeal of the bum , the mucker , the Dead End kid , the James Jones-Nelson Algren-Jack Kerouac hero . " <P> He was , of course , ruthless , utterly cynical , a fluent liar , and ( in the opinion of some psychiatrists ) a paranoid personality . And yet " there was to this ogreish creature a kind of innocence that may be one of the clues to his triumphs and his failures . " Innocence because , as Rovere sees it , he never seriously believed in his own charges , his own cause , so that even his hatred was pretense . During Committee hearings , he could turn on his rage at will and stage a tantrum walkout just in time to get to the men 's room . " McCarthy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by demons . . . He lacked the most necessary and awesome of demagogic gifts-a belief in the sacredness of his own mission . "
