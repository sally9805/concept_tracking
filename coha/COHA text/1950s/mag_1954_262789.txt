For 84 years , before the Communists came , Stamatia Moschou never once left the mountain village of Vavouri that was her home . There her ancestors were born and died ; there her children grew up to bear and bring up children of their own . But in the years just after World War II , when Communist guerrillas roamed and pillaged at will in the mountains of northern Greece , whole villages were often kidnaped as hostages . An estimated 40,000 Greeks , mostly civilian women and children , were rounded up from farms and firesides and taken behind the Iron Curtain . The villages that had been their homes were burned behind them . <P> The village of Vavouri was no exception . One day in 1948 the Red raiders aimed their guns at 84-year-old Stamatia Moschou and her family , and ordered them to march toward Albania . Along with 300 of their fellow villagers , the Moschou family-grandmother Stamatia , her daughter Alexandra , her grandsons Christopher , 15 , and Evanghelos , I , her granddaughters Dimitra , Maria and Spiridoula-were driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights . For close to a year they were herded from camp to camp , between Albania and Yugoslavia . At last they were thrown into the hold of a Russian freighter . " Like so many animals . " said Alexandra Moschou . <P> To Live at Peace . Once when the freighter tied up at a wharf at one port , young Christopher managed to steal a look out of the fetid hold . The ship was in a British harbor , but no Britons were permitted aboard to see the human cargo she was carrying . In the face of the Communist guards , the Greek prisoners kept quiet . Soon afterward the freighter tied up at a Polish port , and the human cattle were transferred from its hold to sealed railway boxcars . Dragged , pushed and prodded from town to town over many months , the Moschou family were finally settled in a Hungarian village whose name had been changed from " Peace " to " Beloyannis " in honor of a Communist spy executed in Athens . <P> In Beloyannis the Moschous and 3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant supervision of Greek Communist secret police . The children were sent to " vocational school " to learn the principles of " good citizenship . " " They had only one objective : to change our opinions and beliefs , " said Christopher Moschou . " First , they would be sweet . Then they would become hard and they would threaten . They told us that jail and torture awaited us when we got back to Greece . " It was their fellow Greeks who did most of the threatening . " The Hungarians , " said another captive , " left us pretty much alone . But our own Greeks-it makes me ashamed . " <P> To Die in Peace . Since the Moschous and the 40,000 others like them were first snatched away , only a handful have been returned to Greece , including 500 adults and children from Yugoslavia after Tito 's split with Stalin . The Greeks asked in vain for the return of the others . Last fall Hungary , falling in with the Soviet peace offensive , offered to return some 600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greeks tried to raise the figure , and succeeded at last in getting Hungary to promise the return of 1,200.
