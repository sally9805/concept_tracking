From England last week came three pictures which , though they may never make millions at U.S. box offices , demonstrate the polish of British moviemakers : <P> The Dam Busters ( Associated British ; Warner ) , despite its unimaginative titte , illustrates the quality and style of Britain 's individual achievements during World War II . The hero of the picture is a five-ton bomb , and though other nations might pridefully point to their own comparable glories , few but the British could have fashioned such a compelling and straightforward drama . <P> To Scientist-Engineer Barnes Wallis , came the idea for a strange new bomb capable of destroying the massive dams at the gateway to the Ruhr Valley . His brainstorm : a spherical missile dropped from 60 feet , at 235 m.p.h. , would bounce for 600 yards along the water to the dam wall , sink 30 feet and detonate . <P> When at length Wrallis licked the bomb 's structural problems , the question of tactical delivery brought new ones . But in May 1943 , Wing Commander Guy Gibson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the North Sea . They found their main targets-the Moehne and Eder Dams-dropped their bombs like bowling balls and watched the dams split like so many papier-mche pins . The deadly strikes flooded factory towns and rolled up one of Britain 's highest scores of the war . <P> Told with just enough of the semi-documentary flavor to give the film a precise clarity , The Dam Busters stands up equally well as good drama and knowing characterization of its principals . Michael Redgrave is intense and human as a dedicated Barnes Wallis buffeted about by bureaucracy . <P> Court Martial ( Romulus ; Kingsley ) , based on a 1953 play titled Carrington , V.C. , restricts its action almost wholly to a military courtroom , where Major " Copper " Carrington ( David Niven ) stands trial for 1 ) being AWOL , 2 ) misapplication of regimental funds , and 3 ) entertaining a woman in his barracks bedroom . <P> Carrington is indeed up against it : he has a distant , neurotic wife ( Margaret Leighton ) , a jealous commander , and is himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he can prove that he gave his commander fair warning before he took 125 from the battery safe in lieu of back pay . But his commander perjures himself , and Carrington 's wife , who could save the day , refuses to help . Thus the story focuses on one of the great pillars of man-made law : the rules of evidence . The military judges know for a fact that the defendant is innocent ; yet , for lack of proper evidence , Carrington is found guilty . <P> However , not even the law-respecting British can let the hero suffer such a wrong at the box office , so a twist ending should make all Niven fans happy . <P> The Divided Heart ( J. Arthur Rank ; Republic ) also deals with law , but it has a truer ring . It replays with touching realism the actual story of Bavarian foster parents who reared their little boy for seven years , only to be confronted one day in 1952 by the boy 's long-lost Yugoslav mother .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
