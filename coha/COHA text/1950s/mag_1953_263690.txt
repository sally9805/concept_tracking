Ferguson , 1896 . <P> " But in the view of the Constitution , in the eye of the law , there is in this country no superior , dominant , ruling class of citizens . There is no caste system here . Our Constitution is color-blind . " <P> - Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan , dissenting in the same case . <P> At the stroke of noon , one day last week , Chief Justice Earl Warren strode through the red velour draperies that hang behind the long mahogany bench of the U.S. Supreme Court .

Davis , dean ( 80 ) of the nation 's constitutional lawyers , arguing for segregation , maintained that separate schools are not only constitutional but often better for the Negroes . Representing the state of South Carolina , the white-haired Davis told the court : " Recognize that for 60 centuries and more , humanity has been discussing questions of race and race tension . . .
