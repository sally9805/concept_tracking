Congress , which has investigated Communists on the stage , screen and radio , last . week got around to the U.S. press . Before the House Un-American Activities Committee appeared Charles W. Judson , 42 . He freely admitted that , under the party alias of " Peter Steele , " he had been a member of the Communist Party from 1937 to 1941 at the same time he was city editor of the Los Angeles Daily News ( circ. 209,000 ) . Judson , now senior associate editor of California 's Fortnight magazine and a militant antiCommunist , named 16 others as members of the party 's Newspaper Unit No. 140 during the same period . Among them : Tom O'Connor , * later a writer on Manhattan 's PM and now managing editor of its successor , the Compass ; Charles Daggett , onetime pressagent for James Roosevelt and now a movie publicity man ; Philip M. Connelly , Los Angeles Herald-Express reporter who later became state C.I.O. president and is now one of the fifteen California Communist leaders awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned itself principally with trying to dominate the management and policies of the Los Angeles Newspaper Guild , although only a small percentage of the Los Angeles Guild members were Communists . <P> Despite his dual role as working Communist and city editor , Judson said the party had never tried to influence him in his newspaper duties . After a year in the Communist Party 's newspaper unit , he found that its orders on Guild matters conflicted with his responsibilities on the city desk , where he had the right to hire &; fire , consequently transferred to a non-news unit of the C.P. But he stuck with the Party three more years , until its role " as a total captive of Russian foreign policy was quite apparent to me . " <P> <P> * Said O'Connor last week : ' I am not a Communist .
