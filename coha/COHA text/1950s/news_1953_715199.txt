txt Strong pressure is being developed by New York educational , teacher and parent organizations to have any legislative program for solving the city 's recurrent budgetary crises include some provision making the Board of Education financially independent of the City Administration and Board of Estimate . This campaign is being led by Andrew J. Clauson , president of the Board of Education , andI Charles J. Gilman , the board 's chief financial officer . Its avowed purpose is to make certain that the . City Administration will be barred from cutting school appropriations below educational needs in order to balance its budget . At present the annual budget for , the City 's school system is drafted and approved by the Board of Edu-1 cation arid then- submitted to the : Mayor for - inclusion in the regular city budget . The Mayor has power I to reduce the school budget before it goes to the Board of Estimate . The ' Board of Estimate can then increase or further reduce it . An appeal for a change in this city 's ' system - was- made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tributed to members of a special commission , headed by Lieut . Gov . ' Frank C. Moore , that is studying ) proposals for making the school systems of the larger upstate cities financially independent of their municipal administrations . He would have the Legislature ; bar the City Administration fromi reducing or altering the education : budget so long as the total was within the amount that would be , produced by a Specified tax on real estate plus the amount of financial assistance for education provided by the state . A somewhat similar provision in the Education Law , but the amount that it guarantees to the school system is so small that the Board of Education has never , been able to operate within it . The present guarantee , fixed by Section 2576 of the Education Law , is the amount that a tax of $4.90 on $1,000 of assessed valuation would raise . The amount supplied by the state in the form of state aid is not included in the guarantee . Paralleling Tax Limit Rise Mr. Clauson and others associated with him would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the school system with enough funds , free of city control , under normal circumstances . They want the new provision to become effective at the same time as any increase in- the total city tax limit such as the pending proposal to raise the maximum real estate tax for general operating purposes from 2 per cent of averpage assessed valuation to 21/z per cent . A constitutional amendment to produce such an increase in city taxing power received preliminary approval in the Legislature last year on recommendation of Lieut . Gov . Moore 's commission , but it requires final legislative approval this year and ratification at a referendum next fall before it can take effect . The increase in the amount guaranteed for education could be mandated by law without a constitutional ' amendment .. There are two pending proposals for making school systems upstate financially independent of city administrations in the larger cities stitutionai amendment . One would enable school boards to levy a tax on real estate up to $9 on $1,000 of average assessed value to obtain money for school purposes in addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax up to $11.50 on $1,000 in addition to the amount received as state aid . Week 's Delay in Decisions Any revision of the city 's educational guarantee would presumably be considered as part of a general financial program for the city . With most of the Republican members of the Senate and Assembly in Washington this week for the Inauguration it appeared unlikely that any decisions on the subject of a general program would be made before next week . A proposal made Saturday night by Controller Lazarus Joseph in an address before the Brooklyn Real . Estate Board for creating a new authority to take over and operate the city 's transit system with power to eliminate the existing operating deficit has aroused substantial interest here . But those representing the State Administration in negotiations with the city looking to a settlement of the city 's financial problems refrained from commenting on it pending further study . Because of the absence of Republicans for the Inauguration , nothing of a controversial nature is slated to come before either branch of the Legislature this week although both houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
