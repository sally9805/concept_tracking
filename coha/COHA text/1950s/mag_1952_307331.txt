" I often twiddle the short wave about , " explained Alan Blackman , 36 , a fishworker of Hull , England . Listening in at 7:10 one night last week , Blackman heard : " Urgent ! Will BBC contact Sir Hugh Cairns at Oxford 58136 , ask him to telephone Dr. Pierres , Colombo ( Ceylon ) 9351 ? It concerns life or death of our Prime Minister ! " <P> The message was repeated at 90-second intervals . Many other British hams heard it and , like Blackman , notified BBC . One listener sent a cable from Sierra Leone , West Africa . <P> When the BBC reached Sir Hugh-Oxford 's famed Nuffield Professor of Surgery*-he tried at once to phone Colombo . Then began a series of frustrations . The Britain-Ceylon telephone is normally in operation only between 8 and 11 a.m . Before engineers could open up the circuit , two precious hours had been lost . <P> Finally Sir Hugh got through to Dr. Pierres , and in an eight-minute conversation got the news : Don Stephen Senanayake , 67 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seriously injured in a freak accident . During his morning horseback ride , his mount had bolted ; after sticking to the horse for more than a mile , he had fallen off , somersaulted , landed on his head and never regained consciousness . Sir Hugh instructed Dr. Pierres how to carry on until he himself arrived in Ceylon . <P> Winston Churchill was at dinner when he heard the news . He ordered the R.A.F. to speed Sir Hugh to Colombo : " Spare nothing-get a plane in the air at once ! " Churchill and the British had cause to be grateful to Prime Minister Senanayake . Though in 1915 he had been jailed for 40 days by the British , he had become by 1948 their staunch friend and a worthy foe of the Communists . He had led Ceylon 's 7,000,000 people to independence without bloodshed , and he became the new dominion 's first Prime Minister . Working to end corruption and diminish poverty , he became known as " the Abraham Lincoln of the East . " <P> At Abingdon Airport in Berkshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fueled and loaded . Sir Hugh was drinking a cup of coffee in the airport lounge , ready to take off , when a final message came . Prime Minister Senanayake was dead . <P> * Among his patients : General George Patton . Lawrence of Arabia .
