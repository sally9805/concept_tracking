Attended by an array of Senators , Representatives and high-priced legal eagles , seven U.S. airlines appeared before the Civil Aeronautics Board last week and proceeded to knee , butt and gouge each other like dead-end kids battling for a prize . They were in fact battling for a prize , the New York-to-Miami run , estimated to be worth up to $5.5 million annually to the line that gets it . The run has long been the possession of Eastern and National . Last April , a CAB examiner recommended that in the " public interest " a third carrier ( he recommended Delta ) be added . There is no doubt that a third carrier is badly needed ; even in the offseason , as at present , travelers must often wait two or three days to get seats . <P> Last week , as CAB opened hearings on the recommendation , platoons of politicians pleaded with the CAB for the line that had promised most to the local folk . Maine 's Senator Frederick Payne , representing the dozen New England Senators , spoke for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American World Airways ; so did Maryland 's Senator J. Glenn Beall. since Pan Am has promised to revive Baltimore 's Friendship International Airport , if certified . Florida 's ex-Governor Fuller Warren " begged for five minutes . " spoke ten , predicted that " hundreds of Eastern 's Miami employees " would be out of work if a new carrier was added to the route . He gestured feelingly at two rows filled with silent , blue-shirted Eastern employees , who had come up to the hearings on their own hook ( according to the pressagents ) to ' protect their jobs . <P> Next the attorneys took over , but instead of the usual amenities , threats and accusations filled the air . Pan American 's Henry Friendly accused Eastern and National of making " exorbitant profits " by supplying " inadequate service , " argued that Pan Am 's own subsidy could be cut $8,000,000 if it got the route . Eastern and National charged Pan Am with carrying on a " tremendous lobbying campaign , " using its officers , from President Juan Trippe on down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off-the-record " approaches to the CAB on Pan Am 's behalf . They denounced Pan Am 's " misrepresentations " to Baltimore and Boston about what it would do for those cities if it got the route , insisted that Pan Am has no equipment " immediately available " for the Boston-Miami run . Turning on Northeast , National and Eastern alleged that it is improperly controlled by Howard Hughes , chief stockholder of TWA , through his 11% interest in the Atlas Corp. , owner of Northeast . ( Hughes fired off a statement denying the implications of the charge without denying the facts : " I own stock of Atlas Corp . as an investor , but I have no desire to take part in the management . " ) <P> By week 's end it seemed probable that a third carrier would be certified to the New York-Miami run , but who it might be was more than ever obscured by the mud .
