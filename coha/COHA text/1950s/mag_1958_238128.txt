After two years of upcreep , the Federal Government 's consumer price index leveled out last summer , even slipped downward a little in August under the delayed drag of the recession . Last week the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that in October the ups and downs averaged out and the index held steady for the second month in a row at the August level of 123.7 ( the 1947-49 average = 100 ) . Up : new cars , women 's and girls ' clothing , rents , medical care , cooking gas , fresh vegetables , beef , milk . Down : house furnishings , men 's and boys ' clothing , fresh fruits , pork , eggs , poultry ( lowest level since December 1942 ) , restaurant meals ( first decline since June 1956 ) . The long-range outlook as most experts saw it : renewed upcreep in prices under the push of wage raises and heavy Government expenditures . But before the climb started , harried consumers found it nice to rest on a plateau .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
