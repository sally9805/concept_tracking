Dear Time - Reader <P> Reporters who cover international conferences are somewhat like golfers or tennis players who follow the tournament circuit . They are constantly running into familiar faces , former opponents and old friends under new circumstances . They also find some of the same frustrations . <P> TIME Correspondent John Beal , a veteran of international conferences , is a case in point . At Geneva , Beal found some familiar faces in the Chinese delegation . The first was Chou Enlai , Red China 's Premier , Foreign Minister and head of the Geneva delegation . Beal had last dealt with Chou in Nanking in 1946 . At the time . Beal was on a leave of absence from TIME to serve as an adviser to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek during the period of the Marshall mission . Beal got to know Chou well during his China stint . " It was there , " says he , " that I learned what the Chinese Communists were like . Chou was my teacher . He was in Nanking heading the delegation negotiating with the Nationalist government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised by nothing that happened in Korea . " <P> Another Geneva figure Beal recognized was the delegation 's secretary , Wan Ping-nan , " a heavy , sinister-looking , ' German-educated Chinese whom I had known in Nanking . " One member of the delegation was unidentified by the West for the first three days . On the fourth day of the conference , Beal cabled : " I was able to identify this man for the American delegation as Chang Wen-chin , who served Chou as secretary and English interpreter during the Marshall mission and is in the same capacity here . " <P> Beal also cited an example of the frustrations of any reporter , old acquaintance or not , in dealing with the men from behind the Bamboo Curtain . Said Beal : <P> TO observe the home life of the Chinese delegation I went to dinner at one of their hotels . As they came into the dining room , three men and a woman sat at one table : another group of three men sat next to them . One of these , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nanking . I had seen him get out of the car with Chou , and his picture was in the Paris Herald Tribune with Chou . <P> As they ate , Chang passed to the next table a copy of the Tribune that he had brought with him , apparently indulging in the bourgeois pleasure of getting his picture in the paper . There was laughter about it at both tables . <P> I waited in the lobby until they had finished and accosted Chang . He answered to his name . When I introduced myself , he remembered me from Nanking with what I thought was a friendly but guarded air . Our conversation went like this : <P> " Well , how is the conference going ? " <P> " I am attending the conference , " <P> Chang said . " I have no comment on that . " <P> " Do you still interpret for General Chou , and sit on the floor with him ? " <P> There seemed to be some pride in his affirmative answer to this and I asked , " Does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in only to the sessions ? " <P> " He stays at the villa most of the time , " said Chang , but he seemed to be a little uncertain of his answer .
