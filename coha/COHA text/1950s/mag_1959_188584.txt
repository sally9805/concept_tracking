The nation 's railroads this week served notice on the industry 's five operating unions of proposed work-rule changes they want in the next railroad agreement to replace the one that expired last week . Preliminary wage sparring has already gone on . The unions pressed for a 36-an-hour boost , and the industry has counterproposed a 15 wage slash . Despite the wide gulf in wage proposals , however , the big fight will still be over union featherbedding . To eliminate featherbedding , the rail companies asked the rail unions to : Extend the basic day 's mileage pay from 100 miles to 160 miles . The 100-mile rate was established in 1919 , when freight trains averaged 12 m.p.h. , passenger trains 20 m.p.h . Today it means that a railroader can do his day 's work in as little as two hours . Wipe out the distinction between the work performed by road crews and yard crews , thereby allowing full interchange of labor without duplicated effort . Eliminate firemen 's jobs on diesels and other non-steam locomotives in freight service and switchyards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management only to stipulate the number of required crew members . End rules requiring idle stand-by operating employees when self-propelled equipment is used and eliminate multiple crew changes on short-run trains . <P> Union leaders challenge the railroads ' charge that featherbedding costs $500 million a year , making it impossible for the rails to compete with taxfree , government-built highways , airports and waterways . They also contend that the number of rail workers has declined by 500,000 in the past decade , despite freight traffic increases . <P> The elaborate mediation timetable established by the Railway Labor Act precludes a strike before spring . But the railroads have warned that this time they intend to get changes in work rules even at the cost of a strike .
