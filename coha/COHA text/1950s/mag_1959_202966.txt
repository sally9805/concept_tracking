Mauled by the heaviest labor-lobby attack since the 1947 " slave labor " campaign against Taft-Hartley , the 30-man House Committee on Education and Labor last week approved a labor-reform bill that was even milder than the Kennedy-Ervin bill sent over from the Senate more than three months ago . G.O.P. Leader Charlie Halleck , coming from a White House conference , called the bill " a diluted version of a watered-down bill , " thus fired the opening shot in the battle to force the Democratic majority in Congress to pass a strong bill or take the blame for none at all . <P> But tough Politico Charlie Halleck knew that the issues were not all that black or white . Key Democrats of the labor committee , in voting out the bill that he called " watered down , " had marched uphill into the muzzles of Big Labor 's biggest guns in one of the 86th Congress ' bloodiest unsung battles . And it was Charlie Halleck himself who had provided six extra votes to push them over the top . <P> " We Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill came from Jimmy Hoffa 's Teamsters and their lobbyist , Sid Zagri ( TIME , July 27 ) , but the quiet power play came from none other than A.F.L.-C.I.O . President George Meany himself . Making a personal trip to Speaker Sam Rayburn 's office last fortnight , cigar-chomping George Meany growled out the facts of life as he saw them . Labor , longtime friend of the Democrats , could not live with the bill as it was being written , he warned . " We ca n't live with the hot-cargo clause ; we ca n't live with the organizational picketing amendment . " <P> Texas Democrat Rayburn told Meany some other facts of life : the American people are thoroughly aroused about labor scandals , and will not tolerate inaction or empty gestures on the part of the Democratic majorities in both houses . At stake in the labor bill , said Mr. Sam , is nothing less than the 1960 congressional elections , perhaps the party 's hope for the presidency . Therefore , snapped the Speaker with cold-eyed sternness , the labor bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt most painful . <P> " Road to Ruin . " Meany and his union brass got a better reception from Mr. Sam 's No. 1 House boy , Democratic Floor Leader John McCormack of Massachusetts . McCormack ( 67 ) is ambitious to succeed Mr. Sam ( 77 ) as House Speaker , is wary of rising competition from Missouri 's youthful ( 43 ) Richard Boiling , who has been Mr. Sam 's quarterback on labor-bill strategy . McCormack covertly began to work for Meany . Good Democrats should never split on labor issues , he soothingly told the Rayburn loyalists on the committee , and " Do n't follow the Speaker down this road to ruin . " As some of the Rayburn Democrats swayed , McCormack threw open support to a skeleton substitute bill drawn up by California 's Teamster-tempted Jimmy Roosevelt .
