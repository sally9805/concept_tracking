The wise guys in Santa Anita 's paddock winked at one another when they heard that Calumet Jockey Steve Brooks had had his choice and had " elected " to ride Ponder . It meant that Eddie Arcaro would be up on Citation , the other half of the Calumet Farm entry in last week 's $50,000-added San Antonio Handicap . More likely , the wisenheimers thought , Brooks had been yanked off Citation after the wonder horse 's defeat two weeks ago ( TIME , Feb. 6 ) . <P> When the bell sent nine starters thundering out of the gate , Arcaro had his hands full keeping Citation from charging into the lead . The big bay was full of run and fighting for his head . As usual , Ponder got off as though he thought he had forgotten something and was debating whether to go back after it . With Brooks sitting chilly on his back , Ponder trailed the field around the first bend . It was not until Citation made his move at the gilt-topped five-furlong pole that Brooks and Ponder decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the whip but he could not stand off Brooks , who was bringing Ponder down the middle of the stretch like a runaway freight train . At the finish of the mile and a furlong , Ponder was a length ahead of Citation . Third place went to Noor , an Irish-bred colt that may be Calumet 's chief threat in the upcoming $100,000-added Santa Anita Handicap . <P> Citation 's defeat , his second in a row , put something of a crimp in his reputation as a wonder horse . It had been a day of mixed news for Calumet Farm ; Calumet 's other glamour horse , Coaltown , had been trounced in the $25,000-added McLennan <P> Handicap at Florida 's Hialeah Park a few hours earlier . The only member of the stable who seemed perfectly cheerful was rosy-cheeked Steve Brooks , who had picked himself a winner . Said Brooks smugly : " Ponder is at the top of his form and is going to be tough to beat in the big handicap . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
