My Three Ye ars as a Dead Man By MAJ . GEN . WILLIAM F DEAN , USA , with WilHorn L. Worden Y last I wenty months in North Korea were NI in violent contrast to the first sixteen . I am convinced that Wilfred Bur-chola , deliberately or otherwise , was principally responsible for the change . He ism ) Australian newspaperman , working for a French communist newspaper . Opinions about him differ widely . But all this man did for me was to make nearly two years of my life livable , by treating me as a human being when I was out of the habit of being so treated , and by causing my North Korean captors to reverse their policy . So I do n't think that it can be surprising that I like him and am grateful to him . On the December night when I first saw him . with Chinese and Korean newsmen , I 'd never heard of him . In my little concrete house near Sunan , he and I sat on the floor in a ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burchett was the first Caucasian to whom I 'd talked since July , 1950I felt like throwing my arms around him . In half an hour he not only filled me in on the course of the war and truce talks , but also told me that my name had been on the prisoner list given to United Nations representatives . So my family not only knew I was alive but Burchett had seen newspaper interviews with my wife and my mother in Berkeley arid was able 1.0 tell me t hat my daughter , June , also was in California . He thought he remembered a reference to my son , Bill , as a West Point cadet . When he produced a bottle of gin and set it on the floor , I was delighted , although I seldom drink gin . Burchett then said , " I 've come to get the story of your capture . " So I talked for two hours . I also showed Burchett my room and described exercises  --  the ones I wished to take . I thought that if a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might actually get to do them . A Chinese photographer , Chun . took many pick ures , some of which later appeared in American newspapers . Finally , Burchett handed me a book of fiction , Pastofsky'a Selected Stories . I said , " Do n't give me that , Mr. Burchett , because they wo n't permit me to have anything to read . Until yesterday I was n't permitted to have a pencil , and I 'm fearful that they 'll take that away tomorrow . " Hut he said , " Well , you may have this book , because 1 already have MY THREE YEARS AS A DEAD MAN ( Continued Fr Page : 10 ) permission from the commander , and I 'm sure they wo n't Lake your pencil away from you . " When 1 told him I was n't allowed to stand up or to take walks , he said , " I 'm sure that 's not the will of the supreme command . " 1 told him I had no reel complaint about food , that I had always eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like rice and kimchee . He said , " When I get back to Kaesong , write a letter to your wife , to be sent via some American car-respondent , and tell her that I 've seen you and you 're well  --  and for her to learn to cook rice as the Orientals do and to make kirru:hec. " 1 said , " Well , I appreciate that very much , but never mind the part about the rice and ktmthee . " ( Now that I 'm home , the only special taste I retain from North Korea is for garlic . I can sit and eat garlic like popcorn . ) But Burchett did write the letter , which reached my wife quickly , and also forwarded to me a pen-and-pencil set provided by Robert Tuckman , of the Associated Press , But even more important was the effect of Burehett'a visit on the North Koreans . Food became plentiful and of better quality . 1 kept the all-important writing materials . and mail began to come through . The petty restrictions  --  not being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any exercise  --  vanished one by one . The first messages from my family came on January 2 , 1952 , three telegrams having been handed by UN correspondents to communist functionaries ( luring the truce talks , and then passed to me by Captain Oh . My mother had wired : " It 's a miracle " ; my wife : " It seems like a dream " ; and my daughter : " You have a husky grandson , horn March 24 , 1951 . " Burehett 's visit started a parade of correspondents ? including Alan Winninglon , of the London Daily Worker  --  to my little castle . But in Chinese , Li Ping Meng , was the important one , from my point of view . On January sixteenth he brought twenty-four wonderful letters . One was from my wife ; two came from my mother ; five from close friends ; two from relatives of men listed as missing in action , asking if 1 knew anything about them . One was from a cheerful teen-ager who sent me  --  although I did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches . The real were from prime representatives interested in getting my story . This was about an average breakdown for my mail thereafter , although the frequency of deliveries varied widely . Once I was five months without mail , and my family went eight without hearing from me . All told . I received 318 letters and two magazines from the United States . But of the letters ! wrote to my family , only about 15 per cent were delivered ? about par for communist mails . I was told that an officer had to make a special trip from Pyongyang to Panmunjom every lime 1 gave them letters to mail . Northbound , mail might stall anywhere . Once Captain Oh rode a bicycle more than ten miles into Pyongyang to get my mail . Another time Dee Soon Vur walked several missing his dinner , to bring mail from the nearest village . But in spite of the casualness of handling , the Koreans were highly particular about the appearance of mail . Once my outgoing mail was sent hack from Pyongyang because my homemade envelopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Li Ping Hong spent a night and day at the house , and during this time assured me that one of my long-standing worries was unjustified . He said be hod just come from a prisoner-of-war camp , and I need have no worry about Americana in it . He had seen Frank Noel  --  an Associated Press photographer captured in 1950 ? and laid Noel had been awarded a Pulitzer prize for photos he had made in the camp . Li also told me about a Christ-male celebration the prisoners had , complete with Santa Claus and presents . He said he had lived in a small house nearby , and that prisoners were permitted to come over and use his record player . I suppose it would have mode no difference in any event , but for some reason I believed Li . He spoke excellent English and said his father and his uncle both were medical graduates from Vanderbilt University , and generally told a straight story . I 've never checked with anyone who was at that particular camp or who saw this man , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrication . Li also gave me his own notebook , which turned out to be my only written record of events in captivity  --  I still have it  --  and added a copy of his rringazinc . Chinn Reconstructs , to my growing library . During the next year and a half , the titles in and out of that collection included : The History of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union ; Stalin as a Military Leader ( in which I discovered that he had invented all the theories of warfare which , in my ignorance , I formerly had credited to Ludendorff , Napoleon or Hannibal ) ; Stalin 's own Problems of Leninism ; Dollar Diplomacy , published in 1925 ; - hick London 's Love of Life ; the London Daily Worker ( guaranteed to make you mad on every page ) and two copies of an American magazine which remarkably came through to me , although both contained several anticommunist articles . Most of the reading matter came from Burchet I or from Captain Oh  --  and I read every line except one incredibly dull British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going , but I 'm glad I read all of it . At least , I know now what ideas we 're fighting , as well as what men . My life settled down . I was allowed to walk outdoors ' most afternoons . My food was much better . I even had a ration of raw eggs , although my taste for them declined after I broke one over my rice one day and a &mina; chicken fell out . I got potted ham , cookies . cheese , canned milk , cocoa and sugar from Lime to time . Most of it was intended for me alone , but the guards had shared evenly with me when things were had , so I tried to do the same . The appreciation was worth the coat in food . In April , Winnington came to see me . But the interview was not especially successful , mainly because he was suffering from the acme disease which dogged me most of the time I was a prisoner . Again there were photographs , and again props were imported . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the Chong-gun hoard was taken away afterward . For Winnington 's pictures , guards produced a rough bench-1 enjoyed every minute of sitting on the first thing resembling a chair which I 'd seen in many months . But that , too , was removed promptly , once the photos were completed . However , twenty-four more wonderful letters arrived on February sixth . These were brought by Tal , the interpreter , whom I had n't seen for a long time . Two days later he was back with dried devilfish and pork to add to our meal , and sake , which I dislike , to make it a celebration . This celebration was for " People 's Army Day . " This was the year whorl Dean celebrated everything . Each major correspondent brought me a bottle  --  gin , Kentucky bourbon and Canadian bourbon . Captain Oh and other officers showed up repeatedly with sake or vodka . In December it had been Stalin 's birthday ; then my wife 's birth ? day . Later we ate and drank for my own birthday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Thanksgiving Days  --  and once celebrated just because we had a bottle . I do n't know where they got the idea that I craved liquor , but it was hard to get out of their minds . I always had in mind that if ever I could get the guard drunk all at once , I might make a break . But I guess I urged them too much ? at any rate , I never could get them to drink much . The only time I had any success was with a new , skinny little guard  --  also named Kim , of course . On one occasion he was delegated by the others to celebrate with me . SO we started on sake , much to my disgust . But I soon found that this was one Korean with an abiding thirst , so I poured drinks as fast as he emptied his glass . Not more than fifteen minutes later , I was sorry . Not only did this boy get drunk with the greatest of ease but he turned as queer as a three-dollar bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Army , we tried very hard to prepare n manual to cover every sit tuition ? but I can see new that we fell down . No manual that I know about gives evens hint of how to escape the caresses and kisses of a drunken North Korean sergeant . So I just dodged and kept filling his drinks . In another fifteen minutes he passed out cold . At most of the parties there were toasts , some translated , some not . And of those translated , there was always some question about accuracy . So my guards drank happily to my toasts : May the People 's Army suffer no other defeats than at the hands of the United States ! " and " To the early victory of the United Nations ! " Al . though I may have lifted my glass to some strange things in Korean , at least we were even . Translation caused continual dill. cultiee . One concerning pictures of my house was fairly typical . International News Photos had sent me twenty-seven photos of the house Mildred had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ever owned . I spent much time poring over them . But the guards were most interested in one living-room shot which showed my wife leaning against a television set  --  never having seen one , I had to assume that 's what it was  --  with a figurine of Li Japanese fisherman visible behind her . The guards were interested in my wife 's appearance , and obviously thought I was lying when I traitorously told I hem her age . But they were even more fascinated by the figure of the fisherman . Who , they demanded again and again , was he ? So , finally , I said , " harabachie " ? that is , my grand . father ? and everybody was satisfied . In May we moved to a more conventional Korean house across the valley . This meant principally a little more room for walking , but the guards had to carry the food much further . Here we spent a lazy summer ; the only real breaks being three movie showings arranged for me in a new " cultural hall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictionalized account of Miamian heroism in World War II ; The International Youth Congress , a documentary showing youngsters from all over the world staring into East Berlin windows bulging with sausages ; and a film celebrating the victories of the Chinese communist armies . This featured a Peiping parade in which virtually all the trucks , tanks and howitzers were American products , now in possession of the People 's Army . In the winter my ear had become infected , so guards had brought in a very young army doctor , who put some gauze in the ear and , I thought , took it out again . At the same time be shooting me in the hip with penicillin which Dee had procured somewhere . Then he left what was undoubtedly the dullest medical needle in the world with Dee , who gave me a new shot every three hours , until I could neither sit down nor move an arm without extreme pain . Nor was I made much happier by the mixing of the penicillin with ordinary drinking water . So although the ear continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it again , for fear of getting more treatment . ( In Tokyo in September , 1953 , an American Army specialist removed from my ear some of the gauze which had been put in it  --  and forgotten ? in December , 1951 . ) In the Kummer of 1952 , this same doctor was called again . when I developed an infected eye . But he was willing to step asido  --  and I was willing to have him  --  when Oh produced a civilian eye specielist , who cured up the infection , but had to be dissuaded from operating on me to remove a pterye ? sum . ( This has been removed since my return home and I still have my eye-eight . For a while there in 1952 , I would n't have given much for my chances of keeping it . ) Thal , summer I had no real faith that there would be either a peace or an exchange of prisoners . I badly needed something to do  --  and I guess the habit of a lifetime is strong : I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gave him any number of sales talks , and when he 'd be due to make a trip to Pyongyang , I encouraged him to shine the buttons on his uniform . At about the mime lime  --  I inure be very foggy about this and a few other matters to avoid hurting people still in North Korea ? 1 began to get suggestions that perhaps I was in the wrong army . The gist of these veiled hints was : " A man of your talents should n't be wasting years as a prisoner . You should do something for mankind , become a true internationalist . Now , if you are interested , it would not be at all difficult . You could have a division in the People 's Army or even command a corps . Or , if you 're weary of lighting , perhaps a political job . Song Ho " ? whom I 'd known as head of the South Korean constabulary ? " has already had his general 's stars pinned on by Kim 11 Sung himself . Your family could live comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can not go into more details than this , but I 'm convinced the offer had some substantial basis ? but , of course , I had to go and spoil it . When I was asked what I intended to do for the sake of peace when I got home , I said , " I 'll try to build up the military unit to which I am assigned in such n manner that it will impress would-lie aggressors . " After that , not too much more was said about a corps for me in the communist army . But in the autumn Captain Oh had an idea which attracted me much more . It would be a cold winter , he said , so we should spend it in China . As a matter of fact , he was quite sure that if I made a request to Kim Il Sung , explaining that I wished to see for myself the wonders of communism about which I had beard , the request would be considered favorably  --  and he , Oh , might also get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When you think about these things later , you wonder how your mind could hove been working at the time . But right then I thought , This may be an opportunity . The Ch inese are notoriously open to bribery , and people down there hate been exposed to American dollars enough to know their value . If I can get to China , I 'll be able to escape . I made the request . It was turned down . So we did n't go to China , but in February . 19.53 , we did go to Kanggye , on the same route I had followed twenty-eight soon ha before . Now ! definitely was receiving the privileges of rank . The privileges included one elderly American sedan , straight off a dead line  --  out of repair area  --  in Pyongyang , and complete with the usual nonoperetive starter and driverwith-peculiarities . This fellow 's special belief was that he would lose face by shifting gears in going uphill  --  and the road to Kanggye goes over numerous mountains . So again and again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat pleasantly behind the wheel while the huskiest of my guards wound the engine by hand . Sometimes it would start again in half an hour , sometimes in two hours , and aometimes not at all  --  and the temperature was six below zero . We pushed the cara mile into one village and were helped by a Chinese convoy in another emergency  --  our driver always managed to block the road when he stalled . But we finally did get to Kanggye and were billeted in an excellent Korean house . Here , while I walked in the afternoons , I noticed more and more American jets , at high altitudetsand without the communist aerial opposition which had disturbed me in the Hummer . I watched these with satisfaction  --  and my guards watched them for bacteriological homlis . My worm's-eye view of this phase of the war may not be important , but it was interesting . AR far as I was concerned , North Koreans started their great defensive campaign against I he nonexistent bacteriological attack with a national inoculation in February , 1952 . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four monster shots and a revaccination . All North Korea had fever and sore arms . Even I got one shot . Then , t here seemed to be no special reason for this campaign , but in May things cleared up . At that time I was shown alleged confessions of American airmen to the dropping of germ homhs , and the propaganda line which went with display of the confessions was , " No , we have n't had any outbreaks of cholera or other diseases from these bombe , but only because of our careful precaut ions , including national inoculation . " So the thing began to make sense from a propaganda viewpoint . First they inoculated the population and then announced that , germ bombe were being dropped by the inhuman enemy . So at the simile time t hey were able to whip up a first-class hate campaign without needing to show any results from the bombing . A few flies and bomb fragments succeeded in convincing even such people as Captain Oh , who believes to this day that germ bombs actually were dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the Koreans watched them with a brand-new hate and fear ? which . incidentally , so inflamed the civilian population that a downed airman had virtually no chance of escape . Although Korean and Chinese intelligence officers always raced to get to him , civilians usually had captured him before either military force arrived . All cooks in Korea apparently are celled Aso-month ( auntie ) . Or at Kanggye was a twenty-Iwo-year-old widow , whose three-year-old daughter I sha n't forget . This whining youngster played around the dooryard and did small errands for her mother . One sunny afternoon she approached me while I was deep in the reading of communist theory . Saying nothing , she extended a gift . I took it without looking . From the often produced by steaming ground rice in a hall . I put it in my mouth and had eaten half of it before I reaiiiaid that even 211,441-nwinie could hardly have packed so much grit into one rice ball . It was a mud pie  --  and I prefer not to think of the condition of the moil from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental . Aaa-frallaae also restored my faith in the fact that Koreans do have ordinary human desires , even in the army . As soon as we went to Kanggye , I noticed that one of the guarda , Song , a widower , even carried water for this cook . Before we left , the story was complete . A curtain was strung up to divide the guards ' room , and Song thereafter slept behind 104 the curtain with Asa-monie and her daughter . I suppose I was witnessing the start of a new North Korean holies  --  hold . I had another diet difficulty in Kanggye . There was the matter of a large dog , something like a chow , which followed a half-grown girl around a nearby farmhouse moat of the winter . The dog was brought to our place one day and walked past my window . Seconds later I heard a single shot  --  and twenty minutes after that . Dee brought me a nice piece of dog liver to eat . I was hungry enough to get that down . But the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The guards gorged themselves on dog meat for two days , but I passed . Too much like eating an old friend . On June eixteenth , we moved south again  --  for once , traveling in daylight . I had a chance to see fields planted where cities had been , bomb-reel:it/int villages hastily built in canyons , and the railroad lined at every stream with whole bridge sections ready to be shoved in place if existing bridges were bombed . I think no major bridge had escaped bombing . But I was ready to believe the North Koreans who claimed that they could have trains running within hours after any new bombing . I also saw elaborate truck hide-outs in canyons . The few houses still standing in the villages were empty of people , but crammed with boxes and Backe of military suppliee . Roads had traffic-control points , complete with lookouts and flagmen , every two kilometers . Again we were passing north-bound traffic , but this was far different from the retreat of 1950 . An entire Chinese regiment passed  --  young troops with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going north . But when we reached the house we had occupied the previous autumn , Captain Oh explained it . He said only one question remained at issue in the armistice talks , and they surely would be completed in a day or two . So I knew that Chinese regiment undoubtedly had been on the way home  --  or to Indochina . I had not seen Oh for some weeks , so I asked a question to be pleasant . I said , " How is your family ? " I received a shocking answer : " I have no family . " His mother , wife and daughter had been killed in the bombing of a village a week before . The summer week . ' of 1953 were charged with excitement for me . My tenseness was increased by the visit of a tailor , to measure me for a suit ; my transfer to another house so that members of the International Red Cross could visit me  --  which they never did ; the wild ammunition wastage at a Pyongyang celebration of the actual cease-fire ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oriental photographers . I walked when I liked , swam in a flooded river , and finally was informed of one more move ? this to Kasei.ong . The guards I knew were left behind , and only one new fellow went along . At Pyongyang , on July fifth , Captain Oh turned me over to a lieutenant colonel , and stepped out of our brand-new Russian jeep . The last I saw of Oh , he was waiting for one of the rickety busses which had just started to run again . At Kaesong I lived the life of Reilly . My quarters were in a former museum , my food was prepared by an excellent Chinese chef , I was able to walk fifteen miles a day in the courtyard , and had a mattress and ' Meets ! I bathed when I liked  --  a wonderful privilege  --  in pools below a waterfall . There , I met Burchett and Winnington again . New unTIIF . SATURDAY derwenr and socks were issued ; my tailored suit was a nice fit . On thisand two subsequent meetings I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burchett , but never arrived at any real explanation for him  --  either for his choice of the communist side or for his kindness to me . The basic details of his story are simple . Burchett worked for British newspapers prior to World War II , and became known to many American war correspondents as well as our service people when he represented a London newspaper in the Pacific war theater , working almost entirely with United States troops and naval units . His reputation for competence was high . Newspapermen who worked with him then have told me since that he exhibited no special political leanings at that time . But , as that war ended , the balding little Australian somehow seemed to get out of aorta with the free world . He was in Europe for some years , changed employers a time or two , was divorced from his British wife ? then changed aides entirely . He arrived in Korea shortly after the North Korean invasion Megan , hut sent few dispatches which aroused any interest until near the and of t he fighting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the communist negotiators in the truce talks . Burchett'e first visit to me had been so exciting that I had not thought too much about just why he was there . I did notice that his description of the war and peace talks was studded with references to " stubbornness of the Americans " or " failure of the United Nations . " The use of " we " in referring to the communist side struck me as odd , and my mind registered as even more odd the repeated reference to a Chinear photographer as " Comrade So-and-So " and to Kim Il Sung as " the Supreme Commander . " But these were only matters of phraseology . At Kaesong he hardly referred to politics , but instead spent his time with me in talking about his family . He mid his present wife was a Bohemian girl from one of the Eastern People 's Democracies and that she had given him another son in April , 1953 , at Peiping . But be spoke often of his former wife and a fourteen-year-old eon in England . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the more mysterious EVENING I'OST figures of the Korean war , I nctually have very little . I can only guess at the devious thinking which led Wilfred Burchett to his present curious status , and can only he very sorry for a man of so many likable characteristics who has gone so far that he never can come back again . On September third , shortly before dinnertime , Burchett came to see me again with a large retinue of Oriental photographers and reporters . He said , " I have bad news  --  for me , that is . This is the last time that I 'll have an opportunity to eat with you . This is good news for you , though . Tomorrow you 're going home . " So we tite , drank and held an orgy of picture taking , focused on Red erase packages from the United Nations and  --  larger , naturally  --  the Communist Red Cross . I was photographed with both , but hardly could endure the delay in getting to use the most wonderful gift in either  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again the next morning , the two most ant isfying shaves of my life . In the morning I changed clothes , shook hands with the guard officers , and the second brand-new Russian jeep took off toward Panmunjom . At the outskirts of Kaesong , we passed a line of waiting trucks . Some of the gaunt American prisoners in them recognized me and began to yell  --  those wonderful Yankee voices yelling , " Hey , general ! " " Hi , General Dean ! " At the head of the truck column , the Korean escort officer got out and an English-speaking Chinese officer , with a guard carrying a submachine gun , got in . There was a wait of a few hours . About this time I began to do some real hard thinking . In those last few hours I tried to add up BORIC of the results of three years of captivity and to decide what , if anything , I had learned . Perhaps I 'm naturally naive , but the greatest discovery to me was that the ordinary communists who guarded me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better road toward an improved life for themselves and their children . It 's easy for us to say , " Oh , but they 're sadly mistaken . " But it is not so easy to explain to them just how , just why this ideology must fail . The one perfectly obvious thing is that we can not convince them of error unless we are willing and able to show them something better . What I mean is illustrated by that election in South Korea in 19.18 . Of course it had faults , hut it generally was a free election , with a secret ballot  --  and nothing was attacked by the communists more savagely . My interrogators were determined to prove that it had not been free ; that . Americans somehow had manipulated it . I think the reason was simply that they in North Korea had never given the people anything to compare to it  --  so , therefore , they had to break it down somehow . When we showed people of the Orient democracy at work , the communists were desperate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had was when one of my guards , a very slow-brained man who had learned a little English , without warning drew in the dirt one day a clear map of the Korean peninsula . To me , he said , " Chosen house , O.K. ? " house . " l8a.id , " Yes , Chosen ( Korean ) h He said , " Not American house ? " and I shook my head . " But Americans , " he said , " in Chosen house . Why ' ? " Fehru Dry 27,1954 You and I know the complicated nre ewer to that , but we need wording aim . pie enough for that man to understand . We must have it . I 've mentioned before my acute embarnisament when a North Korean interrogator asked me , " Did you personally explain to your men why they were lighting ? " and I had to lie to him , because I had neglected to do that during the twenty days while I led troops in Korea , although I bad always made a point of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made in three years , I think this one  --  never to let this happen to me again ? le the meet durable . I believe it could be expanded to a general principle . We , each of la , need to know exactly why we 're fighting , in Korea or anywhere else . An army can be a show window for democracy only if every man in it is convinced that it does fight for a free world , for the kind of government he wants himself  --  and that he personally represents the ideals which can make a world free . Lip service is not enough . We most live our ideate ; it is n't what we say that counte , in the long run . It 's what we do and how we do it . I am ? troop commander and in no sense a politician , and , of course , I speak for no one else . But I do believe these things : That we must present a factual world better than the core . munist dream ; that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand ; that we must , each of us , know and understand the things for which we fight . If I learned anything in captivity , these were the lessons . Presently , the column moved south toward Panmunjom , past increasing piles of American clothing ? precious anywhere in North Korea  --  thrown away in the neutral zone by repatriated communist prisoners . We passed trucks of them , nearly naked , waving mall North Korean flags like so many nonkeye . In clipped English , the Chinese officer said , " Now , when we get there , do n't you get out until they call your name . A Chinese officer will come down the line and read of the names . But do n't get out of the jeep until your name is called . " We passed an American military policeman standing at an intersection , with his parked jeep , his uniform and his boots all shining . In the trucks , Americana shouted  --  but for once , no soldier taunted an MP . They were too glad to see him . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big American colonel stepped up and saluted me . He said , " Welcome back . General Dean . Will you step out , sir ? " Whereupon , the Chinese o fficer spluttered , " No , no . Not until his name is called . " The colonel swung toward the Chinese and suddenly looked twice his size . I do n't doubt that he had been tried beyond endurance before or that he was technically correct when he said sharply , " Your authority is finished right here . We 'll take over . " Ax he spoke , he took a step toward the Chinese . But I could see that this might develop into something highly unpleasant ? and there were truckloads of men waiting behind me . I said , " Never mind , colonel . Let them call the names . A few more minutes wo n't matter now . " Nor did they .
