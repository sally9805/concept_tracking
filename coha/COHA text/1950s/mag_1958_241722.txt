It is a dark night in Hopei province . <P> Armed with a pistol , a fervent young woman named Chin Lan Tse patrols the dikes that protect her village 's cotton fields from the waters of the Grand Canal . But - hark ! - what is that sinister shadow slinking away near by ? As a dedicated Young Communist , Chin Lan Tse knows the answer : it is a skulking saboteur in the employ of the decadent Kuomintang clique . Chin Lan Tse pulls the trigger . " Bang ! " and the bullet flies out . " Ah yah ! " bellows the fascist running dog of capitalism as he vanishes in the night . Dauntless Chin Lan Tse pursues him , falls into a ditch . What bad luck ! But , no , it is good luck . For it is at this very point that the treacherous saboteur has done his foul work : water is trickling through the dike . What to do ? The hole is too large to be plugged by a finger , and , anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who saved the plutocratic fields of Holland from the sea . Chin Lan Tse is resourceful : she applies her maidenly breast to the breach and stoppers it . She almost freezes to death , but " her heart burns like fire , " sustaining her until rescue comes . <P> Specks of Success . Such is the plot of Red Flower , one of the seven novelettes written by Liu Shao Tang , the " boy genius " of Red China , between his 13th and 1 6th years . More than 100,000 copies of his work were sold , and Liu modestly noted that " whatever little specks of success I may achieve - I who have always been reared and cultivated by the party - such specks of success are the result of the party 's blood and heart . " At 18 , armed with a party recommendation , Liu left off writing about the heady world of production quotas , collective labor and agricultural cooperatives , entrained for Peking University to " study life more penetratingly , and undergo self-transformation . " After one year Liu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw himself into the perpetual fires of struggling life . " <P> But to party members in Hopei he was not the same old Liu . The Boy Genius became " disobedient , more conceited , even mercenary . " Instead of seeking out stories of " socialist realism , " he went about engaging " people in talk about which girl in which household had given birth to a bastard . " He sneered that novelettes like his own Red Flower were " divorced from reality " and " stories told to console children . " When Comrade Mao propounded his slogan of " Let all flowers bloom . " Liu seized the opportunity to publish a new book , Grass at Hsiyuan , which , according to the shocked China Youth Daily , " turned Communists into monsters " and described many old party members as " war lords , vicious hoodlums , sex fiends , idiots , whores . " Liu was sternly " advised " to behave himself , but he airily replied : " Please , I can not bear so many well-intentioned warnings . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
