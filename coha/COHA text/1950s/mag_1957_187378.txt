It was late afternoon , and Kentucky 's sports-loving Democratic Governor Albert Benjamin ( Happy ) Chandler had on his hunting clothes and was carrying a shotgun in the Ballard County Waterfowl Refuge . But was Happy actually hunting ? Not a bit of it . Rather , as the story came to be told , he was just sort of standing around bird-watching with Wildlife Commissioner Earl Wallace and a couple of refuge employees . Then suddenly a crippled goose lurched across the horizon , and Happy , with nothing but euthanasian motives , blazed away . He and his companions were promptly collared for hunting afterhours by Game Warden Kendall Thomas , who had heard some after-hours goose and duck calls and was watching through binoculars . <P> Last week the charges against Chandler and his fellow bird watchers were dismissed by Special Judge Anderson Moss on the ground that the afterhours regulation had not been published in the county newspaper ( the rule had been set by Commissioner Wallace in the first place ) . And Happy had merely wounded the crippled goose . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : he got fired .
