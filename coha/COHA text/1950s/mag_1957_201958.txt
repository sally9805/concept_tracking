In move and countermove around the globe , U.S. diplomacy last week : <P> Clinched with Saudi Arabia the final details of the Dhahran air-base agreement worked out by President Eisenhower and King Saud during the King 's visit to Washington ( TIME , Feb. 18 ) . The Saudis extended U.S. access to the vital strategic base , 1,000 miles south of Russia 's Baku oilfields , for another five years . In return , the U.S. will give the Saudis some $50 million worth of services in the period by helping improve Saudi Arabian civil-aviation facilities , setting up or extending present U.S. training programs for the Saudi army , air force and navy , etc . <P> Reaffirmed , in the face of Saudi Arabian threats to bar foreign shipping from the Gulf of Aqaba , its support of the principle of " innocent passage . " The U.S. view : the gulf , gateway to the Israeli port of Elath , has international status , i.e. , no nation may blockade it unless the International Court of Justice rules otherwise . <P> Bolstered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baghdad Pact countries against Communist aggression . The announcer : Special U.S. Ambassador and Ike-Doctrine Salesman James P. Richards . The announcement : the U.S. will provide the pact 's four Middle Eastern members ( Iran , Iraq , Pakistan , Turkey ) with $12.5 million in Eisenhower Doctrine funds to spur " regional " highway , railroad , telecommunication projects . In Saudi Arabia , Richards scored heavily with King Saud , who bought deeper into the Eisenhower Doctrine by issuing a joint communique promising " to oppose Communist activities , other forms of imperialism and any other dangers that threaten peace and stability in the area . " <P> Revealed by way of a NATO Council announcement in Paris that the U.S. would provide some of its NATO allies with three types of missiles in fiscal 1957 , among them the ground-to-ground Honest John and Matador , the ground-to-air Nike . Said General Lauris Norstad , Supreme Allied Commander in Europe : although U.S. law forbids the delivery of weapons with nuclear warheads , the NATO forces should get training in both " conventional " and nuclear missilery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Russian ships which recently used the Panama Canal . <P> Spelled out before a meeting of the U.N . Disarmament Subcommittee in London the new U.S. plan aimed at limiting and eventually halting H-bomb construction . Gist of the plan : the U.S. , Britain and Russia , having first agreed on an " effective inspection plan , " should 1 ) halt production of fissionable material for weapons purposes on April 1 , 1958 , or as soon as possible thereafter upon the ratification of the necessary agreements ; and 2 ) thereafter divert all such nuclear production to peaceful purposes . Net effect of the plan : while allowing the big powers to hang on to nuclear weapons stockpiled before the cut-off date , it would " reverse the trend " of nuclear armament and pave the way for transfers of existing stockpiles to non-military use .
