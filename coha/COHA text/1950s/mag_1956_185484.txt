Cessna Aircraft Co. , fast overhauling Beech as the biggest U.S. producer of private planes , last week went into jets . The Air Force announced that it would buy more than 140 of Cessna 's trim , twin-jet basic flight trainer , the T-37 . Cost : $26 million . <P> By investing in its first jet-powered basic trainer , the Air Force hopes to save money by sharply reducing the flight hours necessary to qualify a cadet for supersonic fighters and bombers . Flight cadets will drop 90 hours of prop training in North American 's T-28 trainer , take the stick of the Cessna jet after only 40 hours of basic piston-engine flight in Beech 's Mentor ( T-34 . In the T-37 , instructor and student sit side by side instead of tandem . With 150 hours in the T-37 , the student can step up to Lockheed 's T-33 , quickly graduate to supersonic F-100s . By 1960 the Air Force expects to have about 500 T-37s in the air . <P> Though it created the T-37 as a purely military jet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prototype of the first U.S. private jet plane . By removing the present gas tank from the fuselage and carrying gas in wing tanks , the T-37 can be easily converted into a four-passenger plane . The plane can take off from a 2,500-ft. runway , fly at a top speed of 400 m.p.h. , yet land at the comparatively low speed of 80 m.p.h . When Cessna gets into peak production of the plane , it expects to be turning them out for the Air Force at $100,000 or less , a price not out of line with present de luxe small private planes .
