THE NOTEBOOKS OF SIMONE WEIL ( 2 Vols. , 648 pp. ) - Translated by Arthur Wills-Putnam ( $10 ) . <P> <P> How does one get the reputation of a saint in the 20th century ? Outside the Roman Catholic Church , where such things are regulated with almost civil-service precision , saintly works are not enough , and miracles are not required . What seems to be necessary is a sort of rapport with the time 's intellectual torments , a capacity for drilling and painfully hitting some universal nerve . That , apparently , is the special gift of Simone Weil , a Frenchwoman who died in 1943 at 34 and who has since been informally canonized as a " saint of the churchless , " a " patron of the undecided . " <P> Her life has already become something of a legend , encrusted in contradictions . As a Jew , she fulminated against Judaism . As a Christian , she could never bring herself to join any church ( she was most drawn to Roman Catholicism ) . Born of a well-to-do Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat sugar because French front-line soldiers in World War I were deprived of it . At 14 , she dispensed with socks because the children of the poor could not wear them . As a young schoolteacher , she flirted with Marxism . To " understand " the workingman , she took a job as factory hand in an auto plant ( " a decision fundamentally silly , the illusion of the Vassar girl of all lands , " as one critic put it ) . Although she fell ill with pleurisy , she enlisted with the Spanish Loyalists , vowing never to use the gun she was issued . Before she died in England during World War II , she starved herself by refusing , though weak and ill , to eat more than the wartime food ration allotted her countrymen in France . <P> But what has attracted attention to Simone Weil , more than her sometimes foolish , sometimes heroic life , is her inner struggle , on which she reported in books such as Waiting for God , Gravity and Grace . Her Notebooks , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most personal account of that struggle . If some of the jottings in these two volumes make her seem like the lead scout of the troubled lost battalion of agnosticism , many more confirm a rare and remarkable religious vocation . <P> Destruction of the " I. " Above all , like all mystics , she hoped to transcend self . " We possess nothing in this world-for chance may deprive us of everything-except the power to say ' I. ' It is that which has to be offered up to God , that is to say , destroyed . " In common with other mystics , Simone Weil skirts the dilemma of how a totally effaced self can remain sentient enough to experience the ineffable joy of its oneness with God , in the rare event that it should be achieved . Simone Weil 's own most telling religious experience : " a presence more personal , more certain , more real , than that of a human being , though inaccessible to the senses and imagination . " It came when she was idly repeating to herself some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' You must sit down , ' says Love , ' and taste my meat . ' So I did sit and eat . "
