Being a housewife is a hazardous occupation . Every year there are 4,000,000 accidents in U.S. homes which disable somebody for at least a day , and as often as not the housewife is blamed for carelessness . This , says Thomas Fansler of the National Safety Council , is unfair . At a forum on " Occupation Housewife " in Pittsburgh last week , Fansler told why : <P> " The average housewife has little more training than that afforded by an elective home economics course in high school . With this , she is expected to deal daily with steam and hot liquids , fire , sharp hand tools , glass and other fragile objects , detergents , harsh cleansers and abrasives , active poisons drain solvents , ammonia , lye , etc. and complicated mechanical and electrical appliances . <P> " In a factory , a worker dealing with such materials would be given not only a complete set of protective clothing , including goggles , but also a complete course of training and instruction under supervision as to how best to do the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets up housekeeping is supposed to know how to do the work without hurting herself and other members of the family . " <P> Fansler acquits the housewife of the charge of carelessness because " the word does not explain anything , and it stigmatizes the person concerned as somehow a little subhuman.
