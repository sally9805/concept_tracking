txt Argentina is shooting down the toboggan slide toward totalitarianism with frightening speed . The Peron regime is destroying the last vestiges of a free press , and without freedom of the press there is no civil liberty . The great liberal newspaper , La Prensa of Buenos Aires , has not only been prevented from publishing for six ' weeks but we are now told that its courageous and high-minded-editor , Alberto Gainza Paz , is under charge of " violating state security " ( in other words , being critical of the Peron regime ) . The whole business can be expressed in a sentence : where you have a free press you can not have a dictatorship ; Where you are instituting a dictatorship you must abolish the free press . This is a pattern that every dictatorship since the end of the First World War has followed . The Russian press had no tradition of freedom , but the Italian and German did , at least to matters of opinion . Mussolini , as in so many things , set the example that Perlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snide , hit-and-miss procedures that took years to crystallize . The Italian parallel to La Prensa was the Corriere della Sera of Milan , one of the great liberal newspapers of prewar Europe . Mussolini forced the owners to sell the newspaper to a Fascist syndicate under threat of suppression . ' Fascist laws placed the press under political supervision ; journalists had to be good Fascists ; editors were held responsible for toeing the line . Meanwhile , gangs of Fascist thugs  --  as in Argentina last week  --  beat up nonFascist journalists , demolished offices throughout Italy and by terrorism made a free and decent press impossible . So they ? all sang hosannas to Mussolini and to the Fascist regime . Germany followed a similar pattern except that a primary qualification was . that every publisher , shareholder and journalist not only had to be a good Nazi but a proved " Aryan . " On the murderous night of June 30 , 1934 , when Hitler smashed the Roehm plot , Goebbels denounced the foreign press for sending the real news and praised " the decency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this not a reminder of what happened last week in Buenos Aires when the foreign correspondents honestly cabled the facts of the Government-sponsored thuggery , while the subservient Argentine press ignored the truth ? The peculiarity of all these dictators ? Mussolini , Hitler , Franco , Stalin , Perlin  --  is the insistence that their system of journalism is the only free one . Goebbels said ' that " liberty of the press is one of the greatest abuses of democracy . " Evidently President Perlin thinks so , too , but he should ' realize that in so thinking and so acting he is putting himself squarely in the line of the totalitarians . This may be all right with him as of today , but it so happens that the free world is engaged in a lifeand-death struggle against totalitarianism . The Communist type is merely one side of the coin ; the Fascist is the other . ** is placing Argentina in the camp of the enemies of freedom and democracy .                @ @ @ @ @
