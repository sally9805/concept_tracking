From the sunbaked wastes of Arizona 's Navajo Reservation came dramatic news about the new TB drug , isoniazid ( TIME , March 3 ) . The report was carefully evaluated in the gleaming tower of Manhattan 's New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center . Then , last week , Cornell 's Dr. Ralph Tompsett got up in London 's cavernous , dingy Central Hall and passed the news to 400-odd experts gathered for a British Empire conference on TB . Sum of the findings : isoniazid is the only drug that belongs in the same class with streptomycin for effectiveness against tuberculosis . In most respects it is as good as streptomycin ; in some ways , better . <P> In the great majority of cases , tuberculosis attacks the lungs . Isoniazid* was first given to such patients a year ago , and enthusiastic reports of good results broke out during the winter . But TB of the lungs is an unpredictable disease ; of two patients with chest X rays which look alike , one may die quickly while the other gets better for no apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , to prove the value of a drug in these circumstances . <P> Human Test Tube . Less common but deadlier forms of tuberculosis are meningeal , in which the bacilli attack the covering of the brain and spinal cord , and miliary , in which they spread throughout the system . Untreated , both meningeal and miliary tuberculosis commonly kill within two or three months , and about one-third of the victims get only temporary help from streptomycin . To researchers , a patient with miliary TB is like a human test tube . The course of his disease is so predictable that they can tell just what a drug is doing for him . <P> As soon as they knew that isoniazid was safe , the Cornell researchers turned to the Navajos of Arizona to give it a thorough test . With their high susceptibility to TB and wretched living standards , the Indians provide a tragically large number of miliary and meningeal cases . Often , one patient has both forms . The Navajos were eager to help medical research fight the white man 's disease which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever did . Their Tribal Council put up $10,000 toward the project . <P> Hungry for the Bottle . The first Navajo to be treated with isoniazid was a seven-month-old baby girl named Patty . When her parents brought her to Dr. Charles M. Clark at Western Navajo Hospital in Tuba City , Patty was a wizened starveling of 9 lbs. , with miliary TB . Her temperature was 103 and she had to be fed by tube . After 17 days of treatment with isoniazid , her temperature dropped to normal and she began taking the bottle hungrily . Now Patty weighs 16 lbs . and her TB seems to have been arrested . <P> A 17-year-old Navajo girl named Jean Smith was Dr. Clark 's next miliary case . She weighed 79 lbs. , had an agonizing , rattling cough and had trouble breathing . Moreover , says Dr. Clark , the X ray of her lungs " looked like a snowstorm . " Under treatment with isoniazid she soon got rid of her fever , cough and shortness of breath . Jean has eaten her way up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
