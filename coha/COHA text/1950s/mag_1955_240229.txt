The Night of the Hunter ( Paul Gregory ; United Artists ) . Davis Grubb 's tense 1954 novel about an itinerant psychopathic preacher is a natural for cinemelo-drama . Directed by Actor Charles Laughton , it is a garish , unbelievable but fairly exciting nightmare . <P> Robert Mitchum , the preacher , knows that somewhere around the small Ohio River valley house of Widow Shelley Winters he will find a $10,000 cache . Numskull Shelley , who does not believe the money is there , falls for Mitchum 's hell fire because she thinks she will find a spark of romance behind it all . But Preacher Mitchum , who thinks sex and painted women are an abomination , really wants to get his switchblade knife on Shelley 's two small children , since they are the only ones who know where the loot is hidden . <P> Actress Winters is better than competent as the mother , and Actor Mitchum is more credible as a murderer than as a Bible-spouting phony . As a whole , Director Laughton 's Night is a self-conscious experiment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and tricky camera angles . <P> The Night Holds Terror ( Columbia ) may well cut the ground from under the Broadway hit , The Desperate Hours , already bought and filmed by Paramount and scheduled for December release . Like the Broadway play , The Night Holds Terror tells of a family held captive by three gunmen who move into their home and take arrogant possession of their lives , money and possessions . Shot in 18 days on a low budget ( $78,000 ) , Night was produced , directed , written and edited by the husband and wife team of Andrew and Virginia Stone . None of the cast has a Hollywood " name " ; most of them came from TV . <P> What emerges is a surprisingly good movie . Aircraft Worker Jack Kelly stops to pick up a hitchhiker ( Vince Edwards ) and the next moment is looking into the business end of a pistol . Following orders , he turns off on a side road where two other badmen join forces with the first . Disgusted by the emptiness of Kelly 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a juvenile delinquent in ABC 's memorable TV Crime in the Streets ) , wings a couple of shots past his head . The gang then attempts to sell Kelly 's car , and failing to get the money that day , moves into his home to await developments . Learning that Kelly 's father is a wealthy man , they decide to add kidnaping to their roster of crimes . <P> When the gunmen depart with her husband , Hildy Parks at last summons the courage to call the police , who agree to cooperate in silence . The tension builds in the last reels through the device of showing the mechanical difficulties of tracing a phone call . The fate of the trapped man oddly becomes less important than the technical riddles that must be solved in determining from what exchange , and in precisely what sequence of numerals , the kidnaper is phoning his instructions . The film ends in the customary blaze of guns , and Kelly is happily reunited with his family . But the film 's considerable effect , like that of Dragnet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the routines , not in this case of police work , but of a telephone-communications center . <P> House of Bamboo ( 20th Century-Fox ) is a well-made cops-and-robbers story filmed in Tokyo . Enhanced by the petal-like beauty of the scenery , the story al most makes crime seem worth a try .
