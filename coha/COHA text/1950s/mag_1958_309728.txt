Mud Month <P> Sir : <P> The month of October is always the month when we show our ignorance to the world . The political mudslinging did neither party any good , and anyone who paid any attention to it should have his head examined by a nonpartisan psychiatrist . <P> <P> PHILIP YARNELL <P> Baltimore <P> Sir : <P> After reading your whitewashing of Ike , I want to cancel my subscription . When I subscribe to a magazine , I want news-not love notes about that golf-playing idiot in Washington . <P> <P> GORDON H. MARTIN San Francisco <P> The Eugerons <P> Sir : <P> We were delighted to see our own Amos Alonzo Stagg on your Oct. 20 cover . Mr. Stagg is a vital part of the life of our association . He is idolized by the youngsters , and has become an example of the highest qualities of Christian character-which we have encouraged our older boys and young men to follow . <P> <P> CARL I. MELANDER Y.M.C.A. Stockton , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> You included the butcher , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I therefore nominate Robert Peet Skinner , a career Foreign Service great . As keen as mustard , Mr. Skinner at 92 is fighting for the return of an honest U.S. dollar . <P> JAMES B. STEWART U.S. Ambassador ( ret . ) Denver <P> Sir : <P> Or Pediatrician Dr. Sydney V. Haas of New York . He is 85 plus . <P> <P> MARGOT SEITELMAN Brooklyn <P> Sir : <P> Seeing Eisenstaedt 's gallery of U.S. elders is inspiring . What a privilege it would be to meet the owners of those faces . One would like to know about their errors and omissions , foibles , loves and hates , and whether they were child delinquents or loved by their parents and happy in their youth . <P> <P> MRS . R. G. MESNEY Curaao , N.A. <P> <P> Sir : <P> Oho ! So TIME has interest only in men ! ADELINE DE WALT REYNOLDS <P> Hollywood <P> Oh , no !

STRAUCH Delaware , Ohio <P> Sir : <P> Growing old usefully-excellent ! Thank you for your kind reference . It accords well with " eugeron " a well old man . <P> <P> C. WARD CRAMPTON , M.D. Miami <P> The Pleasure of His Company <P> Sir : <P> Plenty of men and women come to Broadway bearing checkbooks . Bumptious or diffident , they hover on the fringe for a season or two . They go over the bumps and to the cleaners and back to their natural habitat , taking with them some deductible losses and dinner conversation . Roger Stevens <P> I Oct. 20 came with a checkbook , but he made it . He is in the theater . And his contribution is unique . You described him the opening night of a hit . Closing night of a flop tells a lot more . He blew in from somewhere ( London ? Washington ? Detroit ? ) to catch the author . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELIA KAZAN New York City <P> Sir : <P> I have done five plays with Mr. Roger L. Stevens .
