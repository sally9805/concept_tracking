" Equal rights for civilized men , " was Empire Builder Cecil Rhodes 's 19th century formula for peace between black and white in Africa . It promised the black nothing immediately , but gave him a future hope . Now the South Africa where Rhodes made his fortune seeks to deny the blacks even a future claim to equality . To the north , in the lands named for Rhodes , South Africa 's course is viewed with foreboding , but Rhodesia 's own halfway house is an anxious place . The tendency among the frightened and the angry is to find ingenious definitions of " civilized " to exclude as many blacks as possible . Last month Southern Rhodesia 's whites erupted in angry debate after a government commission proposed that anybody , white or black , was entitled to vote if he could read and made $42 a month . <P> Hulking , handsome Garfield Todd , the ex-missionary from New Zealand who is the colony 's Premier , was indignant . " We are in danger of becoming a race of fear-ridden neurotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of Rhodes will pass from the land unless racialism is banished . " Summoning a caucus of his dominant United Rhodesia Party , he told the legislators : " The vote must be " given to those Africans who have earned the right of being called civilized and responsible persons . " His suggestion : Give the vote to all Africans who have reached " Standard Eight " level of education-corresponding roughly to the sophomore year in high school-whether they meet the income requirement or not . To mollify the conservatives , Todd conceded that for those not qualifying under this " special " educational dispensation , the income requirement should be kept at $56 ( which excludes all but a handful of top Negro wage earners ) and that the enrollment of " special " voters should not be permitted to exceed 20% of the total electoral roll . Faced with Todd 's threat to resign if they balked , the legislators surrendered . <P> The change will add an estimated 6,000 skilled African workers-teachers , medical orderlies , agricultural demonstrators , senior policemen , etc. , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under present rules , there are about 50,000 European voters on the rolls v. 800 Africans in a population where blacks outnumber whites twelve to one .
