When Columbia Records Inc. reissued some of its early Louis Armstrong recordings it ran into plenty of competition : some of the same records were already being sold by an obscure company called Paradox Industries , under the label " Jolly Roger . " This pirate trademark was well justified , Columbia and Armstrong charged last week in a joint suit seeking to stop Paradox from selling the records and to collect damages . Paradox , they charged , had simply taken the old Columbia Armstrong records and pressed its own new ones from them . <P> To Columbia it was a clear-cut chance to make a court test of the growing business of record-pirating . In five years , said Columbia 's President James B. Conkling , his men have tracked down the pirating of some 30 different brand-name records . Up to now , Columbia had never been able to sue because the pirate firms would skip town or change their names . <P> Paradox , a hole-in-the-wall outfit run by a 23-year-old Manhattan record collector named Dante Bolletino , showed no sign of doing either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom pressing " department , which turns out records for many small companies . Some of Bolletino 's pressings were even pirated from RCA 's own Armstrong records . Bolletino cheerfully admitted that he had pressed from the original Columbia-owned records . But he insisted that he had violated no law , since copyrights do not cover records . He had not copied Columbia 's trademark , which would have been a violation . <P> Aware of the hole in copyright laws , Columbia based its suit on " invasion of property rights , " and Armstrong based his on an " invasion of privacy " ( i.e. , using his name without permission ) . <P> Pirating has been given a big boost by magnetic-tape recording equipment . With it , pirates can record top artists and orchestras from radio or TV broadcasts , frequently have finished recordings ready for sale within a few days . They job them through a few legitimate stores , but mainly through shops dealing primarily in secondhand records .
