Klee on the Side <P> Sir : <P> I was interested in TIME 'S suggested interpretation of Paul Klee 's High Water-Wood Sept. 17 . Modern art can mean different things to different people . Tip the picture to the left and you can see Woman eternally holding Man in her fingers . Judging from their expressions , neither one is too happy about this situation . <P> <P> IRENE POWELL ANDERSON Chicago <P> Sir : <P> Klee 's whimsy is in the realm of fantasy but never obscurity . Turn the painting in a vertical position and the " areas of green , yellow and blue " show a self-portrait . <P> <P> HELEN M. KELLEY <P> Lansing , Mich . <P> <P> For a look at Klee on the side , see <P> cut. - ED . <P> <P> Estes of Este <P> Sir : <P> In your Sept. 17 article on Estes Kefauver , the statement is made that Phredonia Estes was descended from the d'Este family , rulers of Ferrara . According to most known accounts , the family died out in the 18th century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a royal house allowing his name to degenerate to Estes . <P> <P> ANDREA G. STONE <P> New York City <P> Says Estes : " The family did n't die out in the 18th century , and Fm living proof of that fact . They came to England from Italy ; they were chased out of Italy because they were too involved in politics . " - ED . <P> <P> Sir : <P> That frivolous grin , which seems to be Kefauver 's natural expression , fits a professional comedian . Democrats belittle Nixon as a potential President . What price Kefauver ? <P> <P> JOHN P. TATE Asheville , N.C. <P> <P> Sir : <P> Considering the exaggeration , distortion and misinterpretation that you employed in trying to ridicule Estes Kefauver , I am not surprised you could find no one better than John Rankin of Mississippi to quote from to back up your opinions . <P> ALICE HEFT Woodmere , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> <P> Your write-up of Estes Kefauver was very illuminating . But it needs to be completed by the statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandson of a Baptist minister and one of the outstanding laymen of the Southern Baptist denomination . <P> <P> F.I . DREXLER , D.D . Mill Valley , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> You have sunk to a new low in slurring the opponents of the Great White Father who golfs on Mount Olympus . <P> <P> DAVENPORT AND MARCIA PLUMER Cambridge , Mass . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Undoubtedly the ability to pitch manure Sept. 17 is a necessary qualification for the Democrat candidate for Vice President ? What can " Adduhlay " do ? <P> <P> C. H. SCOTT MCALISTER Bloomington , Ind . <P> <P> Sir : <P> I wonder if the American voter will not say on Nov. 7 : " As Kefauver loved me , I weep for him ; as he was fortunate , I rejoice at it ; as he was valiant , I honour him ; but as he was ambitious , I slew him . " <P> With credit , of course , to W. Shakespeare . <P> T. F. CLARK Maryculter , Scotland <P> Adlai &; the Issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American scene ( " Who is Elvis Presley ? " - Sept. 17 ) Stevenson has disqualified himself for the presidency . <P> RALPH BOHMER Jamestown , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir :
