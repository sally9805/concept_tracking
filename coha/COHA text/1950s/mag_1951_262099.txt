Commercial broadcasters are not the only ones scrambling for a place on the nation 's air waves . In ten years , the armed forces , airways traffic control and such interlopers as the two-way radio of the U.S. Secret Service and Internal Revenue agents have more than doubled the use of Government frequencies . Last week , President Truman asked a 60-year-old electronics engineer named Haraden Pratt to become his telecommunications adviser , charged with the task of untangling the nation 's air net .
