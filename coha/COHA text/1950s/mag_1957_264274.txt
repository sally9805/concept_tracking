" My hand is not shaking . I am not weeping or hiding under my desk . I am cheerful and alert . I face life with optimism . This agency will go on . " Such was the almost joyful reaction of Executive Vice President Charles Brower of Batten , Barton , Durstine &; Osborn last week as he announced the loss of Revlon , Inc. ' s $8,000,000 account . <P> All Madison Avenue knew exactly how Brower felt . It was like coming out of the trenches to blighty and peace on earth . Even as they panted after Revlon , the most dynamic cosmetic-maker in the U.S. , veteran admen gulped their Gibsons nervously at the thought of also taking on Revlon 's rambunctious President Charles Revson , 50 , the most feared , cheered and jeered advertising client since the late George Washington Hill of American Tobacco fearlessly sent Lucky Strike green to war . <P> Kicked , pulled and pushed by restless Charlie Revson , Revlon 's sales have leaped from $16 million to $86 million in only eight years . Revlon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ice , Say It With Rubies ) and powders ( Love Pat , Touch and Glow ) adorn the faces of more U.S. women than those of any other maker . Its TV programs ( $64,000 Question and $64,000 Challenge ) have become contemporary Americana . But all the while Charlie Revson , who will spend $16 million on advertising this year , feuded bitterly with the admen and used nine separate agencies in 13 years . Few other advertisers can make that claim . <P> No Crumbs . The war began in 1944 , when Revlon 's then small $600,000 account was first snagged by McCann-Erickson 's John McCarthy-who lasted a stormy six months with Revson . The two men finally fell out over McCarthy 's dirty fingernails . When Revson needled him , McCarthy snapped : " What do you want me to do , use nail polish ? " Revson laughed-and ordered McCarthy thrown off the account . Now executive editor of the Catholic Digest , McCarthy , who still has dirty fingernails , says freely and even admiringly : " Charlie is a genius . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just chews people . up . Unless you can bully him when he 's wrong , you 're through . " McCarthy wonderingly describes an agency meeting with Client Revson : " It started in the afternoon . Around 7 a waiter from Longchamps came in to serve his dinner . Not a crumb of food was offered to anyone else at the table . The meeting went on through the night . " A perfectionist , Revson can talk for hours over the exact shade of red he wants in an ad . <P> After Revson had chewed up a reported 18 account executives , McCann-Erickson got tired of the slaughter and parted company with him in 1948 . Revlon shifted to the William Weintraub agency , where , said one adman , " Bill Weintraub knew how to handle Revson ; he just outshouted him , and everything was fine . " Then Weintraub 's Norman B. Norman , who holds the record ( seven years ) for working personally with Revson , bought out Weintraub to form his own Norman , Craig &; Kummel agency . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Revlon than trouble began . Says Norman : " After watching it the first night , Revson told me to cancel the show because it was the worst trash he 'd ever seen . He so frightened me that I sat up with him until 3 in the morning . "
