How 's Your Telephone Etiquette ? Bad telephone manners waste eons of time and millions of dollars every clay . Here 's how you should treat Alexander Graham Bell 's brain child . By Craig Thompson Away back , when the telephone was little more than half its present age , some anonymous jokesmith fashioned a wheeze that still gets around . One version of it had a fellow seated at a desk in an office , carrying on , at the top of his voice , what seemed to be a conversation , while two co-workers stared . " What 's he doing ? " one of them asked . " S-s-sh , " the other shushed . " He 's talking to Paris . " " I can hear that , " said the first . " What I mean , why is he holding that telephone in front of his face ? " While there 's no way of knowing how many other people may have chuckled at this now hoary joke , it 's a pretty safe bet that no telephone-company executive ever has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental image of the party at the other end of the connection holding the phone half a dozen inches from his head rather than risk an earache by bringing it closer . The result is a lot of garbled speech , numerous conversational repetitions and waste of equipment time . To the telephone man this kind of waste is not funny . It is , rather , one of the oldest and least curable operational problems the telephone companies face . Anywhere in the U.S.A. : Hours pass as the American teen-ager ties up the lint with chatter about clothes , fads and boys , boys , boys  --  and even plays records over the telephone for her equally talkative friend . In the Bell System and in other large companies , such as the General Telephone Corporation , the problem is classified as one of etiquette , or manners . A look at their bulging fileson etiquette suggests that , among all the machines with which men have complicated their living while seeking to enrich their lives , the telephone stands apart . It is used more frequently by more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more it is used , the more it is misused . In contrast to the oboe , which Danny Kaye condemned as an ill wind nobody blows good , the telephone has to be described as a good instrument nearly everybody ill-treats . Bad telephone manners are by no means limited to those who shout , or to those who hold the transmitter more than an inch from their lips when speaking . They are also displayed by the mumblers ; the chewers and gnawers who try to talk with a mouth full of gum , or with pipes , cigars , pencils or other impedimenta between their teeth ; the wrong-number guessers who disdain directories ; the executives who want nt the party they arc calling to be on the line before picking up their own phones ; the party-line hogs ; the busy , busy people who let their phones ring and ring before answering ; the operator baiters , and a long list of others . To the telephone executive they all add up to one thing  --  wasteful inefficiency . Even the time-honored word " hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle , speculation to wonder how Alexander Graham Bell , the man who invented the telephone in 1876 , would make out if he should return from his grave . It was his habit to open a telephone conversation with a resounding " Whoo-hoo . " ( Continued on Page as ) // But Americans do n't have a corner on bad telephone manners . The French , who are prone to give the old hello a triple rende ring ? " allau , al tau . allau " ? are fully as had-mannered , and the Germans no better . The Russians would doubtless be a great deal worse if they only had enough telephones to give them sufficient practice . And the British arc in a class by themselves . Not only do they freely indulge in the meaningless " hello " ; they stretch its uselessness into whole sentences and paragraphs with the addition of phrases such as , " 1 say , are you there ? " Trans World Airlines , an international corporation , recently made this British attitude a matter of comparative record . Concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up special courses aimed at showing its employees how they could use a telephone to win friends and get new business . The instructors reported that they found the French amenable and the British intractable . Britons took the position that if anything was wrong vs ith their telephone manners it would have to be corrected at the other end of the line . In this , they were at one with Randolph Churchill , scion of Sir Winston . Once , in Moscow 's National Hotel , the younger Churchill was overheard dressing down a Russian operator , who knew no other language than her own , with the classically British admonition : " I say , it 's no good your speaking to me in that foreign gibberish . " However , since the United States has more telephones in service than all the rest of the world combined , by a ratio of about six to five , it is here that the problems of bad telephone manners reach gigantic proportions . The operating utilities long ago realized that the installation of equipment and the maintenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1912 they had begun a campaign to teach subscribers how to make more effective use of the instrument . In that year the New York Telephone Company , a part of the Bell System , asked one of its bright young copy writers  --  a fellow named Howard G. Stokes to prepare a booklet that could be used in this educational program . Stokes took the oblique approach . He felt he could n't come right out and tell the customers they were a lot of ill-mannered , ill-tempered boors , however truthful that might have been . So he reminded his readers that a display of friendliness IS the surest way to get things done easily and quickly , and extolled the virtues of cheerful courtesy . Anticipating Dale Carnegie by decades , Stokes titled his booklet , Winning Friends by Telephone , and closed it with the line , " The voice with the smile wins . " Few industrial slogans have ever had a wider impact or longer life . " The voice with the smile " became the test for countless sermons ; vaudeville actors wove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of telephone directories , newspaper advertisements , billboards , mail inserts and other places . In February , 1957 , Stokes ' slogan turned its forty-fifth birthday and it was still in use . But , alas , so were the same bad manners that inspired it in 1912 . Consequently , every passing year sees the telephone companies stepping up their educational efforts . This promotion of etiquette , divided among many companies , uses up millions of dollars every year . But the costs are small compared to the potential benefits , both to the companies and to the users , that may be gained from a reduction of the time wasted . Subscribers , however , frequently find this difficult to believe , A prevalent attitude was summed up by one of them , " If 1 waste time on a call , I pay for it , do n't I ? " The answer is , " Of course . " . But the matter has other aspects , and for the information of the subscribers a few startlingly astronomical figures may be in order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been placed in service . At the same time , the costs of maintaining , improving and expanding the equipment necessary to keep old and new phones operational have been rising steadily . In 1955 , the Bell System alone spent $1,643,000,000 for such purposes . In 1956 the figure went up to $2,200 , - 000,000 , and for 1957 anticipated expenditures are $2,500,000,000 . While most of this unprecedented outlay represents improvements and expansions that may be expected to produce additional revenues for the companies , a very substantial part is due to rising costs of labor and materials . Normally , business passes on its rising costs to the customer in the form of higher prices . Though they have not always been successful , the telephone companies have chosen to try to hold the rates down by offsetting higher costs with increased efficiency . And efficiency means just one thing  --  finding ways by which more people can make more calls on the same amount of equipment . In this effort , hundreds of millions have been spent to develop and install such things as coaxial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and automatic dial systems . Yet , every extension of automation has proved once again that the quality of service the subscriber gets , and the level of efficiency the telephone companies are able to maintain , depend peculiarly on the telephone user 's own behavior . An example occurred not long ago in San Diego , California . There , as a preliminary to the inauguration of long-distance dialing , all local numbers were changed from six to seven digits . As usual , this was preceded by an intensive campaign to tell people what was being done , when , why , and what they should do about it . Nonetheless , when the change-over was made , San Diego , ranking 28th among United States metropolitan areas in population , shot to the top as the No. 1 wrong-number town in the nation . Fewer than 600,000 persons began dialing 36,000 wrong numbers every day or more than four times as many per person as did 12,000 000 in polyglot New York City and environs . It took nearly a year of intensive educational efforts through newspapers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal proportions  --  a whopping waste of dollars and telephone time . Turn now to another common type of waste . One day last summer a traffic representative of the Bell Company of Pennsylvania made a routine check on a small Philadelphia firm that maintained its own private branch exchange , or PBX switchboard . From nine to twelve A.P.1. the company received seventy-five calls . In eighteen instances the company employee being called delayed thirty seconds or more in answering the ring on his extension phone . In five of these the delay was upward of a minute and a half . Thus , solely because some of its employees did not answer their phones on the first or second ring , this company not only suffered a loss of fourteen minutes during three hours on some of its own equipment , but inflicted the same amount of loss on its customers . When averaged out over the morning 's incoming traffic , the waste amounted to eleven and one-fifth seconds on each of the seventy-five calls received . The instance seems picayune , and standing alone it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone system it ( Continued on Page 6 ! ) ( Continued from Page 58 ) becomes something almost too big for comprehension , As of June 30 , 1956 , there were 58,083,000 telephones in service in the United States , and some portion of this equipment was being used to complete 218,000,000 conversations every day . The wastage of eleven and one-fifth seconds on each of these completed calls would mean the loss of more than seventy-five years of useful telephone time every twenty-four hours , Most assuredly the subscribers pay for it . Nobody else could . To measure poor telephone etiquette in wasted dollars , however , is to look at only one of its aspects . Another , less measurable but no less real , is that by his telephone manners the individual can bring upon himself , his family or his company all manner of misfortunes and disappointments  --  lost jobs , lost promotions , ruptured friendships , spoiled business opportunities and so on . A few years back the city of Baltimore learned a surprising lesson . Under the supervision of an educator named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of business courses in the city high schools . As more of these business students went into jobs , however , Hyde began to get a disturbing flareback of complaint . It seemed the youngsters were adequate at dictation , typing , keeping books , filing and other office procedures . but just did not know how to use a telephone properly . On top of that came the discovery that textbook publishers could not provide suitable courses to remedy the situation because , as far as they knew , none existed . Hyde took this problem to the Chesapeake and Potomac company , local link in the Bell chain . Earlier , he found , the Bell System had created an instructional kit called Adventures in Telezonia which it was already furnishing to schools for use by about 2,500,000 pupils a year . But Telezonia was for fourth-graders and too elementary for Hyde 's needs . So , with the aid of a representative of the local phone company , Hyde put his own kit together . It consisted of a textbook for the students , a manual for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classroom two students use the phones for practice calls while the amplifier renders their voices audible to teacher and class . Then the teacher guides a corrective discussion of their performance . A took at the text shows that good telephone manners are hardly anything more than simple courtesy . Yet Hyde 's innovation proved to be something that educators all across the country had been seeking a long time . The fact that it is now being adopted by one high-school system after another suggests that millions of our adolescents yearly stand in need of being taught : To answer the telephone promptly , and to say something informative , such as " ABC Company , " rather than a mere " hello " ; speak directly into the transmitter in a normal tone of voice ; be considerate by giving the caller undivided attention : take notes on all information that may be needed later ; enunciate distinctly  --  not " Wadjado ' ? " but " What did you do ? " ; get the caller 's name and use it  --  not " yeah " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; be sincere  --  promise to do only what you can and will do , and then do it promptly ; hang up gently . Seems elemental , and it is . But , given this kind of foundation , it is possible for almost any person to build a telephone personality as distinctive as a signature and sometimes more valuable . For the things that a telephone , in the hands of a master , can be used to accomplish are astonishing . One such master is a Washington columnist who uses what may be called the technique of the evocative silence . It is his custom . when in search of a particular piece of information , to call the person most likely to have it and begin an exchange of trivial pleasantries . This goes on while the columnist gradually works around to what is , for him , the important question . This he asks in the same casual tone . If the answer is n't what he thinks it should be , he abruptly drops into silence . Then , as his silence extends itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is seldom more than a minute , the person at the other phone experiences a flustered embarrassment somewhat akin to a sense of guilt . To put an end to the ordeal , he begins to talk , and more frequently than not , to say things he had not intended to say at all . Swiftly , then , he finds himself committed to statements he had no desire to make , and soon wishes he had n't . But by the time regretful pangs begin , the columnist has rung off , dialed another number , and is serenely hoisting another victim on his extraordinary rack . Superficially it may be argued that this use of silence is another form of waste . Actually a sharp distinction is drawn . Waste is the misuse of telephone time that benefits neither caller nor called , whereas any technique that is effective is not deemed wasteful . While the telephone companies spend millions yearly to encourage timesaving etiquette , they also spend more millions to encourage more people to use the phone more often because higher levels of efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is promptly spent on another . The telephone companies reason that the more effective the phone is for a subscriber 's purposes , the more he will use it . To this end , the companies employ scores of " commercial representatives , " a part of whose job is to dream up ideas by which the phone can be made a more effective tool of business . One such idea is the " thank you " call . It works this way . Each morning in the office , say , of a millwork-and-builders ' - supply house , a salesman studies the new orders just arrived in the mail . When he thinks he has figured out a way to deal with each . he begins calling the persons from whom the orders came . A connection established , the pitch begins , " Good morning , Mr. Smith . This is Jones  --  Tom Jones  --  of Acme Millwork and Supply . want to thank you for the order we just received , and tell you it is getting our promptest attention . By the way , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I ask because I notice you 've ordered ten of our X-1-2-3 panel doors . if you can take twenty-five , l can offer you a better price  --  in fact , I can save you two dollars on each door . Shall I change your order ? Make it twenty-five instead of ten ? . . . Fine , Mr. Smith , I 'll do that , Now , I also notice your order does n't say anything about hardware ? " And so on and on . Viewed coldly , the " thank you " is a gimmick , a means of getting a foot in the door to make a sales pitch . Yet , company after company has found it a quick , inexpensive way to increase business by sums that may run from a few dollars to a few thousands a day , And the best part of it is that even when it fails to sell , it still leaves the customer feeling good  --  warmed by a grateful word in a thoughtless world . The " thank you " call is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives are prepared to suggest to business subscribers . They also stand ready to provide advice , experience and special equipment to help anyone develop his own ideas . As , for instance , in the case of Harold Leitman , a New York City tire salesman . Back in 1948 , Leitman acquired a bargain lot of war-surplus truck tires . He bought a mailing list of companies operating truck fleets , prepared circulars and initiated a direct-mail campaign to sell them his tires . When , a few days after the last lot of circulars had been delivered to the post office , virtually no returns had come in , he grew impatient . So he sat down at a telephone and began calling some of the same people he had circularized . The result of his first day 's work left him exhilarated and a little incredulous . Out of twenty calls he got fifteen orders . " I figured , " he says . " that I had something . " The " something " that Leitman had was an idea for a new kind of tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping directly from factory to consumer , he could save a lot on warehousing and other delivery costs . Also , using the same combination of direct-mail and telephone selling , he could cut sales costs considerably , Then , by passing most of these savings on to the purchaser in the form of lower prices , he could put himself in an extremely favorable competitive position . Leitman took his idea to the New York Telephone Company , where the experts , encouragingly co-operative , provided both advice and special services to help smooth its operation . Now , nearly nine years later , Leitman 's " something " has become a company that owns and operates its own factory and sells upward of 56,000,000 worth of tires a year . It employs a staff of twenty-five salesmen , none of whom has ever seen a customer , and pays a telephone bill of 5150,000 a year . In this development it has hit upon and exploited quite a few sales gimmicks . Leitman is , understandably , secretive concerning most of them . One of the cutest , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bona fide drawls , to solicit prospects in the South . and Yankees to deal with the New England trade . For a long time now , telephone selling has been under a cloud . Reputable businessmen have shied away because shysters and fly-by-nights have often resorted to the phone . But success stories such as Leitman 's are bringing the telephone an ever-widening business usage . " We are beginning to realize that it is possibly the most valuable machine the businessman has , " says Ronald Crawford , president of the old , conservative Basso Printing Corporation , of New York , " if we can only learn to use it effectively . " This need , in turn , has given birth to a brand-new type of specialist  --  the management consultant who , for a fee , will write telephone sales manuals custom-tailored to a company 's specific needs and instruct a company 's personnel in their most effective usage . One of these specialists is a tall , grizzled man named Theodore Allen ( Ted ) Johnson , of New York City . Although his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone usage , Johnson himself is learning new things all the time . Some time back he got out a twenty-four-page booklet entitled 49 Ways to Make the Telephone Sell for You . In less than a year he found himself revising and enlarging it under the title " 63 Ways " and so on . As Johnson sees it , the basic fact that keeps him in clients is the ever-shortening work week , " Look , " he says ; " the salesman is the foundation of all business . No product or service a company can offer is ever worth anything until some salesman has found a customer and converted it into money . important buying , the big-money buying , is mostly done by the big company 's high-level executive  --  the very person who is hardest to see . No matter what time he may reach his office in the morning , he 's seldom free to see callers before nine-thirty , By noon or a few minutes after , he 's on his way to lunch , which is usually a business discussion and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be distracted  --  thinking about what portion of his paper work he 's going to take home , about the train he 's going to take , wondering if he 'll have time to stop off at some bar for a quickie on his way , " Now , all this means that the salesman has just five hours a day , five days a week , to get the most important part of his job done  --  the job of seeing his prospective customer . The salesman who tries to do this by paying a personal call , sending his card in and waiting in an anteroom , is hopelessly lost . There just is n't enough time available to him to get much done . The alternative is to use the telephone to make firm appointments . There are obstacles here too . The executive always has a secretary to screen his calls , and usually he also has an assistant , a sort of glorified office boy , to talk to callers the boss does n't choose to speak to . The salesman who tries to deal through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were sitting in an anteroom . To get anywhere at all , he 's got to get through to the boss . " There are certain , definite procedures , " Johnson says , " that experience has proved effective . It is to the salesman 's advantage to know what these procedures are , and also to know how to vary them to suit the particular circumstances of each individual case . My business is finding , refining , developing and selling such procedures . And , for the moment anyway , I 'm keeping pretty busy . " way a grin that seems compounded of amusement and mischief , Johnson adds , " Remember , if the executive did n't have that phone on his desk , he 'd probably be working the same twelve-hour , six-day week his grandfather did . But since it is there , he has to take some of his business to the lunch table because that 's the only way he can have a long , quiet discussion away from telephone interruptions . So a lot of people must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , the schools , the salesmen and the specialists all working in the same direction , it would appear that those 218,000.000 calls a day now being made are only a starter  --  the mere beginnings of the Telephone Age . The prospect brings to mind a story told by Robert Casey , one-time ace reporter on a Chicago newspaper . Cuba , it seems , was having one of her perennial revolutions , and Casey had been sent to Havana to keep Chicagoans abreast of its progress . One day , in his hotel room , he put in a call to his office . Presently he was greeted by the cheery voice of one of his paper 's switchboard operators . " Good morning , Mr. Casey . And how are you down there , enjoying all that beautiful sunshine ? " As she completed her question , a nest of machine gunners in the park outside the hotel cut loose at a group of their enemies on the hotel roof . As usual , their aim was bad . Casey dived for the floor , taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Just listen to that ! " He held the phone to an open window , the better to catch the chattering below , " What 's that ? " his operator asked , " Honey , " he replied , " that 's a machine gun chewing the ceiling out of my hotel room . " From faraway Chicago came the gasp of a frightened woman , " Good heavens , Mr. Casey , " she said . " Take care of yourself . " And she disconnected him . Not the best of etiquette , perhaps , but sound advice for everybody , and getting sounder day by day .
