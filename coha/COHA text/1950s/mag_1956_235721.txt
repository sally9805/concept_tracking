When he noted the below-average record of Washington children in reading and arithmetic , District of Columbia Commissioner Brigadier General Thomas A. Lane thought he knew just what was wrong and how to correct it . Integration had thrown together children of unequal preparation , he told the Washington Education Conference . West Pointer Lane 's solution to the problem : a mass demotion to restore students to their proper grades . <P> His proposal outraged both parents and educators . It also set off a public debate calling attention to a problem that many a Southern and border-state school system will eventually have to face : how to get past the transition period if poorly prepared Negro students are put into classes with white students several years ahead of them in training . <P> New Foundation . Washington 's schools were integrated in the fall of 1954 . Before that they were divided into two groups : Division 1 for the white schools , Division II for the colored . There was scant connection between them . The average Negro high school class was seven students larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high schools could afford to offer the special remedial courses which students coming to Washington from the South urgently needed . One reading test given to eighth-grade Negro students found them lagging behind white students by roughly three years . <P> Despite such advance warnings , most Washington educators were unprepared for the problems that integration has imposed . Commented one principal , whose school is now 60% Negro : " It 's largely a matter of economic background . There 's just nothing to build on . We have to give them some foundation before we can even start . " Because most of the Negro students come from poor homes , teachers have had to spend considerable time attempting to straighten them out on matters of hygiene and discipline . <P> Greater Need .

" It is the duty of the public schools to accept children without blaming them or punishing them for their lack of intelligence or limited cultural background , " said a committee of 17 school officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The answer , the educators believe , is to keep Negro students with white children of their own age but give them extra help through special grouping and remedial classes . To do that Washington will have to increase its teaching staff . But even with more teachers and smaller classes , Washington educators know that they are in for a long uphill fight . " You ca n't put two school systems together overnight , " said one administrator last week . " The shaking-down process moves slower than sand through an egg beater . "
