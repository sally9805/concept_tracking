Polish journalists believing that limited freedom is better than none , have carefully avoided open battle with the ruling Communist Party . They have been sorely provoked nonetheless . Soon after the government 's suppression of the free-swinging youth magazine Po Prostu ( TIME , Oct. 14 ) last fall , party censors salted liberal wounds by smothering at birth a new intellectual magazine named Europa . <P> Last week the tension between writer and commissar stretched even tighter . The party decided to turn the independent-minded daily Sztandar Mlodych ( Standard of Youth ) into a house organ for the Communists ' discredited Union of Socialist Youth Association . Then Stalinist Author Leon Kruczkowski , chairman of the party 's Cultural Commission , bluntly warned the press that censorship will become an even stronger " weapon of cultural policy . " <P> The only publication in Poland that seems immune to party lockjaw is a twelve-page satirical weekly with the apt name of Szpilki ( Needles ) . Garishly printed on cheap paper , cocky , 24-year-old Szpilki ( pronounced " shpeelky " ) sticks its needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartoon deriding the cultural isolation of Leon Kruczkowski and other hacks on the party 's Trybuna Literacka ( Literary Tribune ) , Szpilki this month depicted three self-pitying wallflowers on a vast , empty dance floor . Caption : " The Trybuna Literacka Lonely Hearts Ball . " <P> One reason for Szpilki 's durability is that many of its best-known staffers , including Cartoon Editor ( and Co-Founder ) Eryk Lipinski , 49 , have long been Communists or fellow travelers and know intuitively how deep they can sink their shafts . In a country that has long suffered satirists more willingly than reporters , Polish newsmen believe that Szpilki is so popular ( circ. 165,000 ) that it is virtually assassination-proof . <P> The weekly is also a harsh critic of the West , but to Poles , in their dogged , rear-guard struggle for democracy , Szpilki 's sharpest needles are reserved for Communist duplicity and doublethink . In a cartoon that wryly helped to explain its own survival , Szpilki showed a technician standing with a visitor in front of a Rube Goldbergian version of an electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " said the technician . " You should see the anti-criticism machine . "
