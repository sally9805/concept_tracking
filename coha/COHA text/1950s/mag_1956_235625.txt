From the lips of Venezuelan travelers to Trinidad , Costa Rica , Mexico and the U.S. last week came bits and pieces of the story behind what censored news cables have lately called " student disturbances " in Venezuela . The " disturbances " shaped up as a brutal police attack that killed a 17-year-old girl who was her school 's " student queen " and wounded children as young as twelve . <P> All accounts agreed that the episode started as a protest by students of Fermin Toro high school in Caracas ( pop . 1,000,000 ) against the sudden switch of examinations from the usual period in July to February . High-spiritedly , the teen-agers marched off toward the Ministry of Education . Almost any mild measure would presumably have stopped them , but the police-minded government of President Marcos Prez Jimenez sent well-armed cops . Angered and insulted by student insolence , the police attacked with sabers and ( according to some accounts ) fired on the shrieking school kids . An army officer arrived in time to see his daughter struck by a cop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policeman on the spot . <P> Thereafter demonstrations of protest-this time aimed at the regime itself-spread to schools all over Venezuela . Students wrecked laboratories and stoned policemen . Medical students at the National University in Caracas , who also work as hospital interns , spread word of wards crowded with wounded youngsters . At one point they ran up on a flagpole what they said was the bloody dress of the slain girl . The police cracked down by arresting teenagers , teachers and protesting parents . <P> How many were killed no traveler could say ; newspaper mention of the rioting was censored clear down to the burial notices . The minimum eyewitness count of the dead was two and the highest estimate was 20 . Other estimates : wounded , 70 to 100 , jailed , 300 to 3,000.
