Before a secluded cabin , 8,000 ft. up in California 's Sierra Nevada range , stood two bare-chested men basking in the mid-afternoon sun . Not far away , hidden by the underbrush , 16 other men closed in silently around the cabin . They looked like unshaven , jean-clad campers , but they were actually FBI agents , armed with pistols and carbines . When they had completed their circle , at a prearranged moment , five sedans carrying reinforcements rattled down a dirt road to a point 20 yards from the cabin . Slowly the G-men converged on the cabin , covered the two sunbathers , routed out two more men and a pretty , plump girl . There was no resistance , no gunburst , only the sound of the soughing pines . Thus last week the FBI ended its biggest manhunt in years . <P> Bewildered Innocence . The prize catch of the high Sierra hunt , a bloated , pink-haired man whose oversized pants were held up by a money belt stuffed with $50 bills , was a study of bewildered innocence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francis Brennan . But the FBI men tagged him on the spot with a fingerprint test as Robert Thompson , one of the eleven top Communist leaders who were convicted in 1949 of violation of the Smith Act . Two years ago , ordered to report to begin his three-year penitentiary term , he jumped bail , disappeared into the Communist underground . <P> The second fugitive was Sidney Steinberg , onetime assistant national labor secretary of the Party , who was indicted two years ago by a New York federal grand jury for conspiracy . The girl was Shirley Keith Kremen , 21 , onetime campus radical , and a budding Red . The other two men , Sam Coleman , alias Samuel Irving Rosenberg , and Carl E. Rasi , alias Carl Ross , were Communist petty functionaries . <P> Altered Appearance . Shirley Kremen , using an alias , had rented the lonely four-room hideout in June . A tidy housekeeper , she kept a plentiful supply of canned goods , liquor and beer on hand , and $2,000 in sugar-bowl money . When she was arrested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread it neatly on a towel to dry . The men stuck close to the cabin , avoided the neighbors , whiled away the time with TV and table tennis . Thompson and Steinberg had gone to some pains to alter their appearances . Thompson , who had gained about 30 Ibs. , had sprouted a foppish mustache , tinted his hair and mustache strawberry blond , his eyebrows roan red . Steinberg had a fresh crew cut and an angry little mustache , was pounds thinner than he had been in his last public appearance . <P> When the G-men and their prisoners arrived in San Francisco , Thompson was taken immediately to Alcatraz , began serving his long-overdue sentence . Steinberg was held for extradition to New York . The others were all charged with aiding the fugitives . The capture of Steinberg and Thompson reduces the number of missing U.S. Communists to five . Of the top leaders who have gone underground , two-National Organization Secretary Harry Winston and Illinois Chairman Gilbert Green-are still missing .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
