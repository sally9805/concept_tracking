THE BLESSING A Story by Hugh H. Nissenson Drawings by Harvey Dinnerstein W HEN Rabbi Levinsky finally left , it was late in the afternoon . Yitshaak went out onto the balcony to watch the old man going home : a solitary , graceless figure , dressed in a lung black coat that flapped about his knees as he walked , with one hand thrust behind him , and the other pulling at his beard . The road lined by eucalyptus trees led uphill . From time to time the old man paused to catch his breath . Even on the balcony , the air was stifling , redolent of plaster and the exhaust fumes of cars . The long tapering leaves of the trees , shaped like knife blades , were covered with dust . The heated ait shimmered above the red tiled roofs of the houses on top of the hill . Beyond them , to the west , beyond the highway to Haifa , and shining between the gaps in the sand dunes , the inert Mediterranean reflected the pale blue sky . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew away from the railing , but it was too late : the old man had seen him , and with a gesture that was unmistakable in spite of the distance , he reproved him again with a shake of his head . Then he went on his way . The road turned left . Yitshaak watched until he was hidden by the row of whitewashed houses and the dusty trees . Standing there , facing the road , Yitshaak could see the grammar school that served the children of the neighborhood . It was here that his son had been enrolled in the fourth gradebefore he had been taken ill . Yitshaak put his hand to his forehead , shielding his eyes from the sun , in an effort to see into the classroom where the boy had studied , It was on the first floor , north , in the corner of the building , but there was nothing to be seen inside . The window was dark . He took a deep breath . Sincc three-thirty , when he had returned home from the hospital at Petah Tiqva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , Kira , who had taken to her bed as soon as she had heard the news . Now , with Levinsky gone , he was frightened at the thought of it . He was grateful that Esther , her aunt , was with her . Not that it really made any difference : he was going to have to tell them both what he had decided . In a way , Esther was responsible . He thought back to earlier in the afternoon and pictured her standing in the doorway when she had first heard about the boy , with one plump arm raised , and those pale , disquieting eyes becoming suddenly brilliant with tears . For an instant , without catching the words , the sound of her voice echoed in his ears . Then there was the silence with a voice of its own  --  a faint buzzing that oppressed him even more . His gaze returned to the school . A little yellow Arab dog , casting an enormous shadow in the light of the declining sun , was crossing the yard with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Esther From the living-room . " Yitshaak ? Yitshaak , where are you ? - He gave himself a moment more  --  until the dog reached the corner of the building , and then went to face her in the open door . " There you are . Where is he ? Levinsky 's gone ? " " A few minutes ago . " " Without saying good-by ? " A S ALWAYS , her glance made him uneasy . He was n't sure why . Her irises were pale blue , almost colorless , clear and untroubled , like a child 's . This afternoon was the first time he had seen her cry . Maybe that was why . She had been in the country for twelve years , the only member of her immediate family to survive the concentration camps . Belsen , a trek across the Alps in winter and on foot , a year 's internment on Cyprus , and now the shabby rented mom in Ramat Gan with its yellow wallpaper , where she lived alone , without complaint , and supported herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , set in that plump , aging face , revealed nothing of what she had seen . " What about tomorrow ? " she asked . " What time does the service start ? " " Early . Eight-thirty . " " That 's a good idea . The earlier the better . Then we 'll get Nira back here before it gets too hot . " " I guess so . " " From Petah Tiqva ? Why not ? It wo n't take more than a half-hour to get home . If the service starts promptly at eight-thirty , we 'll be back here by eleven at the latest . What about the hired cars ? " " What about them ? " " How many are you going to have ? " " One . Why ? " " I thought so . That 's not enough . That 's only enough for the four of us  --  Levinsky , you . me , and Nira . What about Zvi and the Rosens ? " They were clerks with whom Yitshaak worked in the safe-deposit department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , " he said . " Has he got a car ? " " A jeep . " " Wonderful . I did n't know . Who else ? What about Lani ? What 's her Nira 's friend from school . mean . The girl who Na tanya . " " Goldman . " " That 's the one . " " They 're away , " Yitshaak said . " They went away on vacation . " " Where ? " " I do n't know . Nira may know . " " She 's sleeping . You can ask her when she gets up . We 'll send them a telegram . Would you like me to call the others ? " " If you like . " " I 'll call them from the pharmacy when 1 go shopping . Oh . That reminds me . Something else . It 's important . I almost forgot . " " What ? " " If they all gu to the cemetery , we 'll have to invite them back here afterwards for something to cat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The meal of condolence . . . " It seemed so remote ; all of the random memories of his religious upbringing seemed now to belong to another life : the dark Polish synagogue on Dizengoff Road with its slippery floor , the candles and fish on Friday night , the red velvet tallis bag that his father had given him on his thirteenth birthday ... " We 'll have to give them eggs or lentils to begin with , " Esther said . " That 's required . After that , you can have whatever you like . Meat if you want . I thought maybe I 'd make veal cutlets . " He shrugged ; she chattered on , now and again dabbing at the sweat that beaded her upper lip . " What is it ? " she asked . " Is anything the matter ? " " No , no , go on . I 'm listening , " he said , coming into the room at last and sitting himself down on the sofa with his hands on his knees . " Did he tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Levinsky . " " Yes . He mentioned it . " " It 's a small world . I used to make all of her dresses when they lived in Ramat Gan . A lovely person . A lovely couple . I 'm glad that he 's the one who 's going to hold the service . " Again Yitshaak shrugged . The laws of the country forbade secular funerals , and it was simply a matter of convenience to contact Levin-sky who happened to live in the neighborhood . " He 's a fine old man , " Esther went on . " Everyone likes him ; admires him , I should say . More ? depends on him . He was in Auschwitz , did you know that ? " " Yes . He mentioned that too . " " That was n't easy for a Rabbi , And not only because of the Germans , mind you . Because of our own . You can imagine what sort of a Rabbi he must he if he still managed to command people 's respect in a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be asked . " " I understand . " " Do you ? " y IT S H A AK gazed about the room . On the coffee table , with its lace doily spread under glass , was a folded newspaper that he had bought on his way to the hospital in the morning . He took it up and began scanning the pages mechanically . It was difficult to concentrate . His eyes burned with sweat , and after a short time , even without looking up , he became aware that Esther was watching him expectantly . Rooted to the same spot in the center of the room , her transparent , inverted image  --  the white blur of her face and her folded arms  --  stared up at him from the depths of the glass . He found it impossible to speak . It was the mention of Levinsky again , the possibility that remained of hope and peace , the chance that if he spoke to the bearded old man just once inure , one of his phrases , perhaps one final word that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an olive branch . He raised the paper , frowning , and tried to resume his reading . There was an article about the necessity of conserving water during the sharav , the heat wave , and another , a letter to the editor from an engineer living in Jerusalem , about the dangers of exhaust fumes from cars polluting the air . 14 . . . greater volumes of oxides , " he read , the words blurring before his eyes . This time he looked up . Quite suddenly , the light in the room seemed to have diminished . Outside , above the red roof of the schoolhouse , the pale blue sky was becoming translucent . " What time is it ? " he asked . " I do n't know . It 's getting late . I ought to go . I 'll tell Zvi to drive straight to the hospital tomorrow morning . There 's no sense in his coming here first . " " I 'm not going , " Yitshaak said . " Where ? " " To Petah Tiqva . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . " " I do n't understand . " " I 'm staying at home . " " Abet- ich kann nicht verstehen , " she repeated , lapsing from Hebrew into German in her astonishment . " Why ? " " It 's not your fault . I do n't blame you for it . " " For what ? What did I do ? " " It was something you said . " " When ? " " When I came back from the hospital . " " I did n't say anything . What did I say ? " Her eyes , clouded , suddenly cleared and widened in remembrance . With her left arm raised , unconsciously repeating the gesture she had made in the doorway , she repeated the words in a bewildered voice : the Hebrew phrase that had involuntarily escaped from her when she first heard of her nephew 's death  --  the traditional invocation upon hearing evil news : " Blessed art Thou 0 Lord our God who art the true judge in Israel . " " It seemed to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-year-old boy . I told Levinsky , but he said they were part of the ritual , too . I 'd forgotten . I have n't been to a funeral since Papa died . Levinsky said that the same words , or words very much like them would be repeated tomorrow , over the grave . I told him if that were the case , I would n't go . " " But why ? Why ? " " Do n't you understand ? ' A true judge . . How can I have any part of that ? That boy was ? " " What ? " Yitshaak shook his head . " What was he ? What ? " Esther repeated , leaning forward , touching the edge of the coffee table with her knees . A drop of sweat trembled from the tip of her nose . From outside , through the open door , could be heard the rumble of a truck on the road , and the faint , high drone of an airplane , coining in , or going out , over the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Yitshaak remained silent . " Innocent , " was what he had begun to say . In some way , he wanted to protest that his eight-year-old son who had been condemned to suffer so and to die from cancer of the lymph nodes , had been innocent . But he said nothing because while the explanation was funning on his lips , it had suddenly occurred to him for the first time that , if anything , her own faith , like Levinsky 's , had in some manner taken that very thing  --  the condemnation of innocence , into account . The realization had left him feeling empty and perplexed . Esther 's faith , after all , had survived three and a half years in Belsen where her husband , a wealthy furrier from Berlin , had died of typhus , and from which her daughter , a girl of thirteen or fourteen at the time , had been deported to Auschwitz in a sealed boxcar and never seen again . " No , " said Esther . " It 's not easy . .. Never think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepts it all once and for all , and that 's all there is to it . " 6 ' ; " What , then ? You tell me that . " " Ah ? " She smiled , blinking her eyes rapidly in the gathering darkness . The drop of sweat AM trembled from the tip of her nose . " Von Tag zu Tag . " He stared at her without understanding . " Tiiglich . daily , " she repeated . " Und jeder Tag . . One must struggle every day .. . " He pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes . No . There was something more . It was n't simply a matter of acceptance . In time , he would come to accept the death , and even the suffering , of his son . That was only natural , almost instinctive , a process of the mind protecting itself . Even now , amidst the wheeling , fading lights in the darkness behind his tightly shut lids , he found it difficult to summon up the boy 's features with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall the pinched face that he had seen that very morning , when the doctor had lifted up the sheet on the hospital bed . The snub nose and the wide mouth , like Nira 's . The tiny mole  --  where was it exactly ? On the Ieft cheek , beneath the eye .. No . It was n't acceptance that he rebelled against . It was something else  --  something which seemed to him to be monstrously humiliating . Every day , the woman before him was struggling not so much to accept the suffering inflicted upon the innocents in the camp , but to  --  what ? Yitshaak lowered his hands . He scrutinized her ; the drop of sweat had gone from her nose . Yes , he thought with astonishment , to sanctify it . She blessed God , her tormentor , and that same degradation would be required of him if he attended the funeral tomorrow . But to what end ? Why ? What purpose would it serve ? He continued to stare at her , and as though in answer , she raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperturbable eyes . . Reconciliation . The promise of peace . Yitshaak stood up ; the springs of the sofa creaked . " When will you tell Nira ? " " I ... Now , " he said . y I T S H A A K ? " his wife called out in a voice that was muffled by the pillow . " Who is it ? Yitshaak ? Is that you ? " The room was in semi-darkness . A broad ray of sunlight , streaming through in the shutters , lit up the corner of the wall opposite the bed . " Did I wake you ? " he asked . " No , no ; what time is it ? " " Almost six . " " That late ? My God . Have you had your dinner ? " " I had a late lunch , " he said . " I 'm not hungry . " " You must n't be ashamed to ask Esther to make you something . " " I will , when I get hungry , " he said , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of the bed . His wife gave him a dim smile with her wide , unpretty mouth , and turned her face toward the corner where the dust danced in the light that was turning a deep red . A stray strand of hair , dark and stringy with sweat , iay on her cheek . She breathed deeply . Maybe she wanted to sleep some more . Yitshaak made a motion to rise . " No , do n't , " she told him . Her left hand rose and fell . " Stay a little while . " " Esther wants to know if you remember Lani Goldman 's address . " " Natanya . Number twelve Weizmann Street . " " I thought she went away on vacation . " " She did . I forgot . They went to Naharia . I think they 're staying at the Dolphin House . " " I 'll tell Esther . " " Are you going to phone Lani ? " " I thought I 'd send a telegram . " " Would you do me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would you ? Speak to her yourself . I 'd like her to be with us tomorrow if she could . " " Nira ? " " What dear ? " He reached out to grasp her left hand , but simultaneously , she had begun a motion of her own , to brush the strand of hair away from her cheek . His empty palm fell on the bedcovers by her side . " Where are you going ? " she asked him . " Can I get you something ? A cup of tea ? " " No , no , that 's all right . But you go ahead . Get yourself something to eat . You wo n't forget to call Lani . " " If that 's what you want . " " Yes . Do , " she said . " Please . Get her to come . " F. 4 S THER was waiting for him on the bal- cony , motionless against the rail . Yitshaak stood near the wall while she finished reciting the evening prayer . arranges in order the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , imperceptible at the height of the balcony , stirred the dusty leaves of the eucalyptus trees , and their dry rustling , merging now and again with her murmuring voice , was the only sound to be heard . . . . and the darkness ... " The breeze died away . " ... for ever and ever . Blessed art Thou 0 Lord our God who brings on the evening twilight . Amen . " Yitshaak was looking at the sky which was paler than the afternoon , and even more luminous . A mass of dark clouds blown in from the sea had settled above the southern horizon , and although the sun had been gone for some minutes at least , a fiery streak of opaque light lingered over the waves . " Was Nira awake ? " Esther asked . " She wants me to call Lani . " " Did you tell her you were n't going ? " " I will . Later . " " When ? " In the last few moments , it had grown much darker still . The contours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hill had become indistinct . Here and there a pale electric light shone in a window , suspended in the dark air . The sky too , still blue , was softly lit as thoughfrom within , but the redness had faded from the clouds . Their black ragged masses drifted slowly to the east . " When ? " The first star of the evening gleamed in the southern sky , directly above a telephone pole on the road . The drift of the clouds in the opposite direction made it appear to be racing west . Another one , much dimmer , more distant , infinitely farther away in space , appeared beneath the first , and that too , because of the drift of the clouds , seemed to be racing out to sea . Yitshaak clung with both hands to the railing for support while the stars reeled above his head , and yet remained where they were , inextricably bound together above the telephone pole and the road . " Well ? " " I . . . " Someone whistled tunelessly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the clatter of supper dishes drifted to him from open windows . " Then do n't tell her , " Esther whispered . " Do n't say anything . " " I must . " " Not if you go . " " I ca n't . " " Go . " " I ca n't , " he said . " Do n't you think I would if I could ? " He had turned to face her . With her head raised and partly hidden in the shadow of the wall to her right , she answered without looking at him , " Yes . " More and more stars were flickering through the thinning clouds . " Yes , " she said . " I know . The final humiliation . . You think I do n't remember ? How many times at the camp did n't I think : ah curse Him . Curse Him . Curse Him and have done with it . Still ? " She pressed her palms together . " Still , one must live . " He nodded , . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few constellations that he knew : the Milky Way , the Big Dipper , in Hebrew , the Great Wagon , that was just visible in the north . " What is it ? " Esther asked him . " What 's the matter ? " He was weeping . With one hand , he gestured toward the sky . All the clouds had gone , and all motion had ceased . In its place , from horizon to horizon , countless stars were shining , arranged in a vast , quiescent , and eternal order that Esther had blessed , and from which he was excluded by the tumult in his rebellious heart .
