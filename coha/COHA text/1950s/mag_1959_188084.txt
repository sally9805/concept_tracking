Moving swiftly one morning last week after a month of patient investigation , FBI agents in six states solved the puzzle of fraud in newspaper puzzle contests ( TIME , March 9 ) . In 86 minutes and twelve arrests they cracked the international racket that , by securing advance answers to the contests , swindled U.S. newspapers for more than a year . The transcontinental swoop bagged two key figures in Detroit : Walter Rex Johnston , 30 , part-time car salesman whom the FBI identified as chief architect and brains of the swindle ring , and a key Johnston lieutenant , Harry H. Balk , 33 , theatrical booking agent . Two Canadians who managed the flow of puzzle information were accused of using the mails and long-distance telephone to defraud , but were not arrested ; the crimes are not extraditable . <P> How It Was Done . The two Canadians-George G. Dingman Jr. , 34 , whose father publishes the reputable Times-Journal ( circ. 10,720 ) of St. Thomas , Ont. , and a sometime salesman named Joseph Dyson-worked out of London , Ont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonexistent newspaper , rented a post-office box for a nonexistent bank . Then they solicited two of the several U.S. syndicates that peddle prize contests to newspapers and that insist on sending solutions , as a precaution , to banks ( or some other unimpeachable agency ) . In due time the phony newspaper began receiving the puzzles-and the phony bank began getting the solutions . <P> Thus equipped , the ringleaders phoned appointed contacts in U.S. cities-Chicago , Detroit , Portland ( Ore . ) , Philadelphia , Harrisburg ( Pa . ) , Minneapolis-fed them the winning answers . Many of the participants were on the fringes of the entertainment business ; Dingman was the only one with a newspaper connection . Often , time zones worked for the swindle ; e.g. , the phony London bank got its answers at least two hours before U.S. newspapers on the West Coast . <P> For months the racket worked like silk , as long as it relied on known and trusted contact men such as Lawrence A. Dyson , 32 , South Philadelphia , brother of Joseph Dyson . Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulletin case , the fixers overcame a last-minute effort to thwart their game : they learned that one letter in the solution had been changed , submitted 24 entries to cover all possibilities . <P> Eventually , the Canadians got too greedy . They expanded , hired outside amateurs-a chiropractor 's wife and a TV repairman in Portland , a pretty secretary in Detroit , a dress-plant manager near Harrisburg-who would settle for peanuts : $150 to $300 cuts of $3,000 and $4,000 wins . The ringers were the ring 's undoing . When in February the suddenly suspicious Portland papers called in the FBI , investigators concentrated on the weak links . After their shamed confessions , the FBI pieced together the whole story . <P> On with the Contests . Each of the twelve arrested last week faces a sentence of up to five years in prison , up to $10,000 in fines . But the gulled newspapers-and particularly the puzzle syndicates-must assume a big share of the blame . The puzzles were ripe for fixing , and in some cases newspapers , e.g. , the Milwaukee Sentinel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two syndicates-General Features and Superior Features-that sold services to the phony paper in Ontario bothered to check the client 's false credentials .
