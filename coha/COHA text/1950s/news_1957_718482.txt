txt Faster , more efficient cargo handling will be one of the key " selling points " of the Boston Army Base pier , whose modernization is continuing at a rapid pace and may be completed by July 1 . With five berths completed and two under construction , the 10-berth pier , offering a mile of dock space just off the main ship channel , is shaping up as one of the Port of Boston 's most valuable assets . Yet two years ago it seemed possible that the giant port facility , undermined by marine termites and weakened by , corrosion , might be abandoned . A rallying by state and federal governments behind rehabilitation plans has reversed the former gloomy picture . Deep Problem The problem in 1954 was how to go about bolstering a pier whose foundation pilings had been attacked by marine borers to a point where there was talk of possible collapse . An earlier attempt to solve the problem with a corrugated metal skirt around the pier  --  to hold in solid fill that would smother the termites  --  had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall was becoming ' paper-thin and the dirt fill around the pilings was beginning to empty into the harbor . Chief item in the $11,000,000 solution arrived at by United States Army Engineers was a concrete wall around the perimeter of the pier . Some $2,000 , - 000 of the total-90 per cent of which is paid by the federal government , 10 per cent by the state  --  was put into other rehabilitation , such as warehouse wall repair , plumbing and elec- The new retaining wall , most of the concrete forh wn.c .. has to be poured under water , has 30-foot base , tapers to a 12-foot throat , and expands to a cantilevered 27-foot top . Height from the dock-level top to the harbor-floor base is about 50 feet . Some 180,000 cubic yards of concrete is involved . Its cantilevered top provides a deck space wide enough for a traveling crane and a new railroad track running the full length of the pier and serving seven of the 10 berths . At present the traveling crane is limited to three berths alongside the two-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building support of one side , the crane ? now sporting new legs  --  will travel over a wider range . With two railroad tracks instead of the present one at dockside , the Boston Army Base pier will be able to keep more railroad cars standing by , ensuring a smoother flow in the unloading process . Double Operation Furthermore , the expanded pier width provided by the new retaining wall permits both railroad and trucking operations to go on at the same time . Work on the pier is being done by the Merritt-Chapman &; Scott Corporation under the direction of the Army engineers , Fay , Spofford &; Thorndike , Inc. , is the architect-engineering firm . By working on only two berths at a time , contractors have interfered little with the normal flow of cargo traffic through the base despite the magnitude of the project . The concrete-making and pouring operation has involved large equipment and a challenging timetable . Each of the 100-foot sections requires 30 hours of continuous pouring once a pour is started . Alternates Weighed Army engineers considered several alternate approaches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility was starting from scratch , tearing down the present decaying pier , and building it all over again , this time using creosoted piles . ( In 1918 the piling was not so treated , but this was not unusual ; the marine borer did not appear in Boston until the 1930 's . ) However , this would have been an expensive proposition . Another proposal was a concrete retaining wall about six feet outside the existing metal one . Fill would be inserted later and a deck added .
