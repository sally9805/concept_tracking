BATTLE OF INDOCHINA <P> Paris heard last week that the Communists planned a full-scale attack on Tonkin 's Red River delta at the next full moon . Premier Rene Pleven called General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny , one of France 's best soldiers , and asked him to take on the tough job of defending Indo-China . Said De Lattre : " I accept because it is my duty . " <P> He planned to fly immediately to Indo-China , wield both political and military authority , which had been divided between High Commissioner Pignon and General Marcel Carpentier . A trim , tough disciplinarian , described by his colleagues as lectrique , De Lattre has been chief of Western European land forces under the Brussels five-power defense union , soon to be superseded by the broader North Atlantic twelve-power pact . <P> Indo-China waited tensely for the next Communist move . If Red-backed Ho Chi Minh attacks with his Viet Minh army , De Lattre may throw him back , but if the Chinese pour in , as they have in Korea , the slim French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign colony which gathers at Hanoi 's Metropole Hotel rustled with rumors . Some said that the Chinese were already advancing from Langson , others that there was a deal on with the Viet Minh . The Metropole 's atmosphere was one of anxious , noisy gaiety . Foreign newsmen met with free-lancing pilots who were making small fortunes flying people out of the threatened area . <P> Outside the Hotel Metropole in the Rue Paul Bert people were quieter as they studied the news from Korea on the Agence de Presse bulletin board . Little Vietnamese men stood wooden-faced in their sharp suits and pearl grey fedoras , their Parker 51s and antimagnetic , shockproof Swiss wrist watches . They were observing the West 's humbling with a terrified , frozen-faced satisfaction ; their Western watches are the fancy kind which tell the days of the month , the phases of the moon . As everybody in Hanoi knows , the next full moon occurs Dec. 24.
