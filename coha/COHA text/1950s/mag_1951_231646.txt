The Problem of Pern <P> U.S.-Argentine relations were worse last week than they had been in years . Washington had tried hard to understand the Peronista outlook ; it had hoped that by using euphemisms for " dictator , " granting fat loans and looking the other way when freedom and justice were violated , it could turn Juan Pern away from totalitarianism . But Washington was wrong . <P> In speech after speech Pern had proclaimed equal distaste for Russian Communism and U.S. capitalism . Then Pern forcibly suppressed the independent newspaper La Prensa and jailed two U.S. journalists for trying to report the event ( TIME , March 12 ) . <P> All this was complicated by Juan Pern 's own unpredictable course . The same Strong Man who publicly protested that Argentina must keep its " third position " had , in the past five years , told U.S. Ambassadors George Messersmith , James Bruce and Stanton Griffis that Argentina would fight on the U.S. side in a third World War . He had repeated the sentiment last year to Assistant Secretary of State Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million credit for Pern in Washington , insisting that no strings be attached . Last week Miller was back from another visit to Buenos Aires , smarting from a brushoff that was insulting not only to him but to the U.S. <P> Climb the Stairs . Pern , who had spent hours in private talks with Miller on his last visit , all but refused to see him this time . He met Miller only in the presence of eight or more aides . Miller never got a chance to tell Pern what the U.S. thought of the suppression of La Prensa . <P> Instead , after one presidential luncheon , Evita Pern whisked the U.S. envoy off with a car of ministers on a tour of one of her Social Aid Foundation 's new hospitals . The elevators were not yet ready , so she marched the party up &; down the seven floors of the building . As they puffed up one stairway , Finance Minister Ramon Cereijo wheezed : " Where 's the psychotherapy ward ? I 'm ready to go in . " All agreed that Evita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how much she wanted the U.S. and Argentina to be friends and work together , put on a terrific performance . <P> Moreover , even during two brief encounters , Pern managed to convey to Miller the impression that he still regarded himself as a U.S. ally . His subordinates predicted that Argentina 's behavior at this month 's Washington conference of American foreign ministers will prove that he is . But by week 's end , the anti-U.S . line of the Peronista press had changed not a whit . The screw was turned yet tighter on La Prensa . <P> Draw the Line . Back in Washington , Miller was not cooled off enough to see what he would recommend next . Hard experience has taught U.S. officials that denouncing Pern only makes him more popular in his own country . There was no blinking the geographical fact that Argentina is part of the Americas . There could be no question of U.S. meddling in Argentine internal affairs . But there was a line that democracy had to draw . At the very least , the U.S. would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship .
