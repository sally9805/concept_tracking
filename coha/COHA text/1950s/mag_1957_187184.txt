Thirty-nine years before the gleam of lanterns from the steeple of Boston 's Old North Church warned Paul Revere of approaching redcoats , a short , stocky Anglican divine , clad in near-rags and wasted by dysentery , tottered ashore at Boston Harbor . After convincing one rector that he was indeed a clergyman ( " my ship-clothes not being the best credentials " ) , Charles Wesley , prolific composer ( 6,500 hymns ) and restless younger brother of Methodism 's Founder John Wesley , preached a sermon in Christ Church , better known as the Old North Church . <P> Wesley arrived in Boston by happenstance . Ailing and discouraged at the failure of a tour of duty in Governor Oglethorpe 's Georgia colony , he sailed for England , had to stop off at the Massachusetts Bay Colony because of stormy seas . When Wesley continued his journey a month later , he was still weak but in fine spirits . For the rest of his tumultuous life ( before his death in 1788 he came to an uneasy rest halfway between Anglicanism , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Wesley remembered the warm reception of his preaching in Boston . He praised the " prospect entirely new and beautiful " of the New England port , spoke highly of the congeniality and " the civility of the fellows " at Harvard College . <P> Last week , on the 221st anniversary of Wesley 's Christ Church sermon and the 250th anniversary of the year of his birth , some 50 Methodist and Episcopal clergymen marched into the Old North Church to the chimed tunes of Wesley 's hymns ( two of the best-known : Jesus , Lover of my soul , Hark ! the herald angels sing ) , to take part in a memorial service . The sermon bore the same title ( ' ' One Needful Thing " ) as Charles Wesley 's , and its substance was the stern kind of moralizing that the 18th century preacher would have approved . Methodist Bishop John Wesley Lord cited the Little Rock crisis ( ' ' The moral sense of the nation has been outraged ' ' ) , continued : " We must seek and find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling the waters . No man has the right or the power to thwart his holy will . We must find out where God is going and then get things out of his way , lest we perish . Our prayer to Almighty God ... is that we will enlarge the boundaries of our hearts to embrace in one great fellowship all his children . . . This is the one thing needful in this moment of history .
