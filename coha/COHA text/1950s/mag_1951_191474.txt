Louisiana 's Sheriff Frank J. Clancy is every inch a king . For the past 22 years he has ruled the delta flats and neon jungles of Jefferson Parish , near New Orleans . Clancy was at his imperial best when the U.S. Senate 's crime investigators swooped into Louisiana last month with embarrassing questions about gambling , whorehouses and bookie joints . He received the investigators with proper hauteur and met their questions with regal silence . <P> But when the Senators prepared to crown King Clancy with a contempt citation , the thought of rubbing shoulders with all those commoners in a federal prison gave the King pause . One day last week he bought train tickets for himself and his chauffeur ( so he would have someone to play gin rummy with ) and rushed to Washington to make amends . Seated in the hearing room of Senator Estes Kefauver 's crime investigating committee , Sheriff Clancy set out to explain some of the royal problems . <P> Jefferson Parish . " I thought that incrimination was more local than it was involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial tongue . " And ... I think that something ought to be said in all fairness to Jefferson Parish . " Of course , he added hastily , " I would not want to say that Jefferson is one of the finest places in the world ... or anything like that . " <P> What did Sheriff Clancy know about crime in Jefferson Parish ? Well , he had been sheriff for only 22 years , so naturally he did n't know all about it . " Insofar as gambling is concerned , " he obliged , " that has been going on there for hundreds of years . I presume that a man that would run for office down there . . . unless he was for it , he could not have been elected . " <P> Why so ? the committee asked . " So many people worked in these places , up to better than 1,000 , " explained the sheriff . " Of those , there were a lot of them were underprivileged and old people ... " <P> <P> Brimstone . Charles Tobey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Sheriff Clancy as if he had just confessed to correspondence with the devil . " Have you upheld the law as against gambling ? " the Senator boomed . <P> " I can not say that I did , " Clancy admitted , with an engaging smile . <P> " Then you have broken your oath of office , " cried Tobey incredulously . <P> " That is right , Senator , " replied Clancy pleasantly . " I broke it for the sake of those old and unfortunate men who could not get employment any other place . " <P> Clancy 's concern for the old and unfortunate went even further-to make sure they got work , one of Clancy 's deputies had the job of hiring all dealers , croupiers , chartmakers and other attendants of illegal establishments . Clancy agreed to let Dandy Phil Kastel , partner of Manhattan 's Frank Costello , open a gambling spot on the understanding that it would help relieve local unemployment . Unless they hired local people , said Clancy grandly , gamblers could n't open in Jefferson . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are the high power who gives the clearances ? " " Yes , sir , " said Clancy proudly . <P> " And when Clancy lowers the boom and says to close , they close ; is that not right ? " <P> " That is right , " said Clancy , " they close .
