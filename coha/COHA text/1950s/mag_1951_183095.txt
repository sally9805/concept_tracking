CARAVAN PASSES ( 304 pp. ) - George Tabor I - Appleton-Century - Crofts ( $3 ) . <P> <P> To write novels in the international manner , as Andre Malraux and Arthur Koestler do , a novelist needs to have been around . Geographically , at least , George Tabori has the qualifications . He was born in Hungary , became a British subject after many travels , now lives in France . His best book was a political novel about Italy ( Companions of the Left Hand ) ; another was a psycho-thriller , set in Egypt ( Original Sin ) , which was chiefly notable for the longest dust storm in modern 1't-erature . This time , Tabori has written a perspiring little novel about Arabia , and garnished it with murder , intrigue and rebellion . <P> Some of the local color is pretty fine , e.g. , the date plantations of the hinterland , street urchins sardonically shoeshin-ing the bare feet of a beggar , the Arabian sun driving a whole town close to frenzy . The story itself serves up the melodrama hot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is chiefly Dr. Varga 's story . He is ship 's doctor of the Ceylon Star , a man who finds the sea a sanctuary and goes ashore as little as possible . Varga 's trouble begins when the governor of Port Aarif , a lecherous old tyrant named El Bekkaa , comes aboard and insists that he be treated for an ailment that turns out , on diagnosis , to be cancer . <P> There is no escaping his duty ; Dr. Varga decides to operate . But he finds himself increasingly distracted by : 1 ) Pamela Vaughan , the good-looking nurse from the British hospital in Port Aarif , and 2 ) a whole array of El Bekkaa 's subjects , who urge him to let his knife slip during the operation . <P> As Varga listens to the list of the governor 's villainies , he ca n't help sympathizing with the malcontents , but then , there is his Hippocratic oath . What should he do ? Moreover , what should he do about Nurse Vaughan ? Nothing works out right for Dr. Varga . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own brief career in Port Aarif comes to an abrupt end when the governor 's bodyguards take after him with silver daggers . <P> Tragedy of the Liberal ? At this point , where he might have slapped his story shut with a bang , Novelist Tabori gives it a twisting curve ; he adds a long Part Two describing an unlabeled Arabian revolutionary movement which has been fighting to overthrow the governor . The epilogue has little to do with the bulk of the novel , and it raises the disconcerting suspicion that Tabori meant Dr. Varga 's story as some sort of significant parable . This suspicion is confirmed by the dust jacket , whereon the author calls his story " a comment on the tragedy of the liberal . " All in all , this is a little like being taken on a tour of Coney Island and then being told that it was all meant as an exhibit of the tragedy of life in the city .
