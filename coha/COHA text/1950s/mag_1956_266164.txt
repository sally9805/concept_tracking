In British Bermuda , U.S. tourists keep to the hotels and playgrounds , Negro residents keep to settlements like Pond Hill , and the eminent old white families keep to themselves-except when they are busy running the colony 's commerce , government and society . Among the oldest and most eminent are the Outerbridges , who date from 1620 . They are so distinguished and numerous that a somewhat tired joke describes Bermuda as " a series of islands connected by Outerbridges . ' ' Not lightly is an Outerbridge expelled from such venerable institutions as the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club , the Mid-Ocean Golf Club , the St. George 's Dinghy and Sports Club . But last week an Outerbridge was out . The explanation : Alexander Stuart Outerbridge , 34 , had married a Negro singer from Broadway . <P> <P> Stuart*Outerbridge started out a conventional scion of aristocracy , approved by all the first families , from the Triming-hams ( Bermuda shorts ) to the Trotts ( hotels ) . He lived in the U.S. for a dozen years , first married Alice Wolcott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lukens Steel Co. ; they had four children . Then he quit a Pennsylvania advertising job and bought Bermuda 's Swizzle Inn , a rum-punch spot , later added a nightclub called Angel 's Grotto . The genteel ginmill business put him in contact with Manhattan cafe society and entertainment types , and he began spending less time with staid Bermudians , more with exciting Americans . By last December his wife had divorced him ; he had been named corespondent in a divorce suit , and was dating Royce Wallace , caramel-skinned veteran of seven Broadway shows and Manhattan hotspots who had flown in to sing at the Grotto . On Christmas Eve he married Royce . <P> Since then , says Outerbridge , " there has definitely been a complete ostracism . My relatives speak to me on the street , but that 's all . " Royce explained seriously that " we wo n't go to the back door of Stuart 's family 's house-and things could be awkward in church , because he has a front pew . " But Outerbridge wants to stick it out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . However , if I get through the slack season , I 'll be all right . I think we 've found happiness ; Royce is a wonderful person . " <P> <P> * His mother was a Virginia Stuart , descended from an impressive roster of jurists and socialites-but not , as reported , directly from Confederate General James Ewell Brown ( " Jeb " ) Stuart . Jeb apparently was a distant kinsman , a member of what Outerbridge 's forebears joked was " the cadet branch of the family . "
