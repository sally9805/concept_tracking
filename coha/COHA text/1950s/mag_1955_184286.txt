The U.S. Air Force last week tentatively agreed to sell 25 of its hot F-86F Sabre jet fighters to the Dominican Republic and 22 more to Venezuela . Other Latin American countries , shopping for similar planes , have always gulped at the cost and backed away . But Washington thought that the Dominican Republic and Venezuela , both prospering under well-heeled strongmen , would be willing to pay the price . $9,000,000 and $8,000,000 respectively . <P> In the Caribbean , asputter lately with small wars , 47 jet fighters mean overwhelming military strength . Four Thunderbolts in the Guatemalan revolution last year , and two Mustangs in the Costa Rican invasion this year , were enough to drive their enemies out of the air ; jets would be even more efficient against the best prop jobs . <P> But if they get U.S. jets , * will the Dominican Republic and Venezuela be tempted to try them against their neighbors ? Washington thinks not . The Organization of American States ' peacekeeping machinery is currently in good repair . And neither of the two nations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever shown much taste for foreign adventure-even on such a suitable occasion as the Korean war . <P> <P> * Venezuela already has 12 British jet bombers ( Canberras ) and 24 fighters ( Vampires ) . The Dominican Air Force is a grab-bag of 42 old and new propeller planes , made in the U.S. or Britain .
