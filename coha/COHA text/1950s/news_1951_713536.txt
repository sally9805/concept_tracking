txt Gen , Douglas 's headquarters here announced tonight that under the new censorship regulations that will go into effect tomorrow no further information concerning land , sea or air operations in Korea would be issued by the Supreme United Nations Command . This function will be taken over by lower-command headquarters of all the services making up the United Nations forces in Korea . Col. Marion P. Echols , General 's public information officer , set forth in a mimeographed memorandum the new regulations , distributed to all newspaper , wire service and radio offices tonight . In the future , the Supreme Com- mand will confine its public information to " releases and communiqu ? s which are general in nature and/or pertain to the command as a whole . " These will include such information as news of awards and decorations , " human interest stories and other information not pertaining to current military operations . " Establishment of the new system came-as a surprise to veteran correspondents of the European and Pacific wars . ' It was the first case in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authority to issue war information ? previously handled and reviewable only by the top command . While Colonel Echols ' memorandum partly clarified the previous confusion over censorship , it did not remove the Eighth Army 's threat to take strong disciplinary action , including arrest and courtmartial against " offending " correspondents whose reports displeased ' that headquarters in Korea . The military appeared to some observers to have so completely entangled itself in red tape and contradiction that literal adherence to the welter of regulations made it conceivable that the Korean war could not be covered at all ? at least with any degree of truth . " Covering Up " Is Suspected Through the haze of conflicting directives , it appeared to many veteran correspondents that censorship , which originally was introduced here for " security " purposes  --  and at the suggestion , if not insistence , of many newspaper men themselves  --  was being used to cover up military ' errors and defeats . This was a familiar practice for war correspondents who had covered the military theatres in the last war . The Eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained officially unknown to General 's headquarters tonight , according to Colonel Echols , who said that his office had " a telephoned and garbled " version . He said that his knowledge of Lieut . Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway 's allinclusive censorship code was based " on press reports . " Maj. Mel Vorhees , chief censor at Eighth Army headquarters , told correspondents there that the regulations had been taken althost entirely from the Army Field Manual 30/26 ? many years old . Colonel Echols ' memorandum today said : " The press advisory division of P. I. 0 . Public Information Office , G. H. Q. , will continue to advise the press on current military information that has been officially reported to G. H. Q. and censor stories originating in Japan . " Advisers ( censors ) will present material previously censored in Korea , the memorandum stated . Voluntary censorship ended on Dec. 20 , when the " advisory " division was set up .

Col. E. C. Burkart , chief of this group , functions under the Public Information Office . The directive used the word " censorship " for the first time in this war . General . , since taking over the United Nations command , had repeatedly . voiced his " abhorrence " of censorship and turned a deaf ear to correspondents ' insistence that the military and not the press take responsibility for at least a : definition of " security " and of what was or was not information of value to the enemy . Admittedly , there have been many slips regarding security considerations  --  the majority of them probably made because the Army refused to assume the responsibility of advising the correspondents . Some extremists among the military already are voicing the opin. ion that " the correspondents cost us the war .

General Parks 4Disturbed ' WASHINGTON ; Jan. 10 IIP ) ? Maj. Gen. Floyd Parks , Army Chief of Information , said tonight he was " disturbed " over reports of rigid new censorship rules applied Ito United States war correspondents in Kw 0 ? " I have queried the theatre to ask about it , " the General told a reporter . Other officials said they understood the Eighth Army was trying to strengthen its public- relations set-up to eliminate confusion and establish harmony with the correspondents . General Parks asked American newspaper editors for " forbearance for a few days until we get this thing on the trolley . " " I think we can get a solution , " he said .
