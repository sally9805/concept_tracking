The Magnificent Yankee ( MGM ) is an affectionate salute to the late Associate Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes of the U.S. Supreme Court , but not a very impressive one . Patterning the movie after his own 1946 Broadway play , Scripter Emmet Lavery sentimentalizes Holmes 's life in Washington in the years between T.R. and F.D.R. <P> The portrait seems to owe less to the Supreme Court 's Holmes than to Life with Father 's Clarence Day . Understandably , the only real conflict in Holmes 's later years , i.e. , the clash of legal ideas , hardly lends itself to dramatization . But Lavery skimps even on a primer-level presentation of his subject 's life work . Having emptied the character of all but the vaguest sense of purpose , to say nothing of greatness , he fills it largely with a butter-soft stuffing of homely anecdotes . <P> " The Great Dissenter " ( well played , as on Broadway , by Louis Calhern-see THEATER ) emerges a gruff but amiable gaffer , quietly and steadily outsmarted by a devoted wife ( Ann Harding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves his country , his profession , the smell of spring and ( deep down ) the Harvard Law School honor graduates who come each year to serve as his secretaries and " sons-at-law . " <P> The movie gives Holmes 's law secretaries fictitious names , * introduces Holmes at the age of 61 , and accounts for his earlier years by loading the dialogue with the kind of exposition-heavy lines that are never spoken in real life . In its favor , The Magnificent Yankee offers some mildly affecting scenes , a Sunday-best M-G-M production and a spirited , if somewhat theatrical , performance by Actor Calhern . <P> Stars in My Crown ( MGM ) nostalgically recalls life in a small Southern town at the turn of the century . Its rambling , episodic story , adapted by Joe David Brown from his own novel , follows the town parson ( Joel McCrea ) through a typhoid epidemic , a friendly joust with a local skeptic ( the late Alan Hale ) , a feud with a young , unproven doctor ( James Mitchell ) , a brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parishioner ( Juano Hernandez ) . <P> The movie is as corny , and often just as pleasantly mellow , as a fond recollection of barefoot boyhood-which is what it is . The period and locale come alive in fine sets and props ; Actor Hernandez and Dean Stockwell ( as the parson 's ward ) give unusually good performances ; the script furnishes some tangy color ( e.g. , the visit of a brassy medicine show ) , and Director Jacques Tourneur flavors the corn with the poetic zeal of a French chef . <P> Out of such wistful images as a lingering shot of two boys on their backs in a haywagon , rolling along in tree-dappled sunlight , Director Tourneur evokes a full-blown atmosphere of carefree rural living . Equally expert when the film bursts into melodrama , he uses only two graphic shots to concentrate all the impact of a burning-cross visitation by the Klan . When the parson later heads off a lynching by an appeal to the mob 's better instincts , the situation is strictly bogus ; yet the scene plays with sure effectiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
