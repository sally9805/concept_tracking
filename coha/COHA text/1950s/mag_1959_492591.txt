OUR LANDLOCKED FARM This is the farm that suits my pocketbook , " i pa said , after we had gone over every acre of it . It has plenty of good water . It has everything I want . Just one thing wrong . Do you know what it is ? " Not a building on it , " I said . " This farm is a wilderness of trees . " Pa stood wiping his red face with a blue bandanna and holding on to his mattock handle . I was carrying the long-handle shovel across my shoulder . We had been over the old Jack Sinnett farm where he had dug holes three feet deep , feeling and sifting the dirt through his fingers , smelling and observing it closely . I had shoveled the dirt back in the holes he had dug on the hilltops , the little ridges and down in the valleys . We had tested each of the fifty acres on this hilly farm . " We can conquer the wilderness all right , " he said . " We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's wrong . There 's not a wagon road ' ding to this farm . " How did the Sinnetts get out when they lived here ? " I asked . " There 's the old road , see , " he said , point ' ing to a winding scar of yellow earth up a rugged slope with tall timber on either side . " That used to be ( Continued on Page 59 ) a county road . That was lifly years ago . That 's not es en a footpath now . And it 's been fenced in . " " Then you wo n't buy this farm ? " 1 said . " Yes , buy it , " he replied quickly . " Any place I can buy has to have a fault so it will sell cheap That 's the only reason 1 ' 11 be able to buy this one . Well buy it and do something about a road later . " Pa bought fifty acres of land in the head of a crooked little Salley , called W-Hollow , for 5300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down payment . He borrowed $100 from The First National Bank in Greenup , Kentucky , to make the first payment , " Now , have land , Sal , " he said to mom . " This is the first land we 've ever owned . We 'll manage someway about the road . I worry more about paying for the land than I do about the road . Have to pay a hundred dollars next year and a hundred dollars year after next . We 'll have to build a house on it . That will take extra dollars . " Then pa got a job on a railroad section . He owned land now , and he was going to work on the railroad section to pay for it . This was in 1921. and I was fourteen years old . My grandfather , Nathan Hylton , had come to live with us , and he was Seventy-five years of age . He had cut timber and farmed most of his life . Grandpa and I planned to build the house while pa worked on the section to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it did n't have a road . " We can pay for the land , build a house and make a road . " pa said one evening at the supper table , after he had walked five miles across the mountain from the railroad section where he had worked ten hours . " All we 've got to do is stick together and work . " In the spring of 1921 , grandpa and I started building our house . We cut oaks on this farm and scored and hewed them into logs to build the walls . Then we sawed down straight , unblemished oaks that we split into bolts and rove into clapboard shingles to make a roof . We had used wedges to split a big rock that had tumbled from a cliff . Then we cut and hewed these pieces into stones to build a big chimney up through the center of the house to carry smoke from two fireplaces . Grandpa was a 220-pound , broad-shouldered man , powerful with a double-bitted ax , sledge hammer , a maul and a crosscut saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that autumn of the same year we moved into the house . We were granted permission by one of our neighbors to drive our mule team across his land to haul our house plunder to our new home . But we were granted permission to haul over his land just one time , that was to move in . We could n't move out again . In the autumn of 1922 1 entered high school . I had pride after I had gone to high school . My pride grew as I saw how other people lived . And we were , at that time , the only family in Greenup County who did n't have a " wagon road " to their home . The only way to get to my home was to walk . In any direction we went we had to walk across land owned by somebody else . On any path we walked we had to climb from one to three hills , and we had to go through  --  climb over or go under  --  from two to eight fences whose owners would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever invited home with me to spend the night said , after we finally reached my home : " It 's a nice place after one gets here . " The thing that puzzled him most was how we got supplies to our house . He looked for a road , and , dl he saw was a fool path going south , one going west , one winding cast , and one climbing north . I never told any of my classmates that we had to carry our supplies on our own backs . Anybody who tried to drive a car to our house parked it somewhere more than two miles away and stalked in , if he got there . Anybody trying to drive a team to our house could get no farther with a team than one could with a car . " Much as I love this place , " mom said to pa one day , " it 's no good , Mick , without a road . We 'd better sell it and buy El farm somewhere that we can reach with a mule team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place we like better , Sal , " pa said . " I 've been talking to your brother , Marlin , and he says we can build a road through his farm . We 're not goin ' to sell this one . We 're fixed here for lifetime . Of course , " he added , apologetically , " we do n't have a road , but we will have one . " Pa and Uncle Martin Hylton planned for some time before they could hind a way to build a road around the steep hills , rock cliffs and deep hollows . But after they found a way we started clearing the right of way . Next we used two mule teams and scrapers . At the little sand gap near our barn , we made a right angle at the first ravine ; then we followed the hill slope down to the next hollow . We made another right angle . Then we made the road up a little valley and around a horseshoe bend , This was almost the same as building a road around one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coming back on the other side . After we made the sharp turn around hatchet-point , we went around the slope to the head of another hollow . Here we had another horseshoe bend . We had to cross three deep ravines . Then , for three fourths of a mile , we went around another hill slope , gradually descending , until we reached the right fork of W-Hollow . Here we united with the road to Uncle Martin 's house . We were proud of this road . It was n't quite good enough to drive a car over , but we could drive a team to our house now . This was my last year in high school . The first spring alter we had finished this road we had three days of hard rain that caused the streams in the valleys to rise high enough to flood many houses . It was during this rain that great slips came into our road . The land cracked above and slid down and replaced the dirt we had moved to make the road . Large trees slipped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effort into building this road than we had building our house and clearing our fields . We had lost almost three years of work not working steadily , of course , but every day we had to spare . " You 'll never get a road for us , Mick , " mom said . " Never despair , Sal , " he said . " I 've got other plans . " " You 've got the patience of Job , " Mom told him . Then we tried to build a road over Uncle Martin 's farm and join the wagon road that came up Tanyard Hollow . But it took a good mule team to pull an empty wagon up the road on that steep mountain . We could n't devise any plan , not even by rough-locking the wagon wheels , to keep the wagon from pushing the mules when we went down . We could neither take a load up the mountain nor bring one down , We lost all the time we had to spare for one year on this road , Thcrc were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless we tunneled miles under the mountain to the broad Ohio River Valley beyond . One way was to follow the yellow gaping ditch that we had first discovered the day we were digging up the land , feeling , sifting and smelling it . We would have to follow this ditch to the ridge , then get permission from the Seaton heirs , who owned the vast tract of land on our west , to follow the ridge path until we came to the headwaters of Academy Branch . Then we were faced with the same problems here that we had faced when we tried to build a road down the mountain to Tanyard Hollow . This mountain was just as steep . The fourth possibility was to go south down W-Hollow . But this way was impossible . Our neighbor , whom I shall call Ben Leadingham , owned this land , and he did n't allow any trespassing . Naturally he would n't let anybody build a road over his valley bottomland . Once , when pa asked Leadingham to sell us a right of way through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer was : " No ! " In 1926 I finished high school . I had worked hard on two of the possible roads of getting to the outside world . We had worked days , evenings , moonlight nights and holidays , and we had failed . The second two roads would not be problems of mine . I was leaving W-Hollow . I had already given my share of energy and sweat for an outlet to our home . Now I would turn it back over to my father , who had n't given up hope . " If there ever comes a time , and I am able to do it , " I once told pa , " I 'll be willing to spend the worth of our farm to get a good road to our house . We 've worked so long and so hard to get it . And we 've failed . Mom has been right all the time . You have more patience than Job . " " It 's the only land we 've ever owned , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've done here . It 's the prettiest little farm in Greenup County . Look at our meadows , barn and young timber . Look what clean , pretty yard and nice little home we have with a roof of our own over us . We 'll get a road in here someway . I do n't intend to stop tryin ' . " I spent four years away from home . I spent one year in the steel mills and three school years and two summer terms in college . When I returned , a college graduate , I walked home . I walked up Academy Branch , and as I walked along the road 1 noticed some strange tracks . There were automobile tire tracks and there were trails made by sled runners in the damp dirt . They were all the way along the ridge . There was n't any improvement on the road . It looked like a road that had been used . " Jesse , since we could n't make a road to this house , " Pa said as soon as I reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 've got the thing that will get over the kind of road we have . I can bring in the supplies now . I got permission to cut two fences and make gates so we could go through with our mule learns . Not any of this carryin ' loads on muleback or on my back . Come , let me show you . " " I think I saw its tracks as I came up Academy Branch and out the ridge , " I said , " That 's right , " he said . " But wait till you see it . " It was a thing , all right . I 'd never seen anything like it . It was half wagon and Half sled . The front part of the wagon was built on short sled runners . The rear carriage was built on automobile wheels . " Where did you get this rig ? " I asked . " Bought it from Brady Callihan , " he said . " Brady hauled corn from that steep hill on his farm . He hauled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front will go across a ditch , and they 'll go up and over a rock or a log . And the wheels behind will roll over anything behind the runners . Handy thing , " he said , smiling . " One mule can pull it if the road 's not too rough . Of course , I use two mules coming up Academy Branch . They can pull a light load on it . The sled runners hold coming uphill to keep it from rolling back . And they are good brakes gain ' downhill . It 's a wonderful thing for my road . " " But four years have passed , " I said . " We do n't have a road yet . Not one that 's legal . And that one out the ridge ca n't be called a road . Any time the Seaton heirs who own the land want to close the road they can . " I noticed that the paths that led to our house had been broadened by more footprints . The paths that came from the south , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother James , and youngest sisters , Mary and Glennis , were in high school now . Two of my sisters were having dates . The young men they were dating drove their cars as far as they could and walked the rest of the way . I stood looking at the paths , for I could see in all directions , while pa stood watching me . He was waiting for me to brag on his new vehicle . Since he had not found the answer to a road , he had found this vehicle as a substitute . it was n't a substitute for our embarrassment . It was a substitute for our backs and the backs of our mules . " Well , what do you think of it ? " he asked me . " All right , " I said . " But we still need a road . There 's only one way out . " " Which way is that ? " he asked . " Down through Ben Leadingham 's place , " I replied . " Oh , I forgot to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What happened to that farm ? " I asked quickly . " It fell to the heirs , " he said , " They 've sold it . " " To whom ? " I asked . " To Uncle Bill Burgess , " he replied . " What about Uncle Bill ? " I asked . " Would he let us buy a right of way ? " " Wo n't let anybody trespass on his place either , " pa said . " He 'd never let us build a road over his land . It 's a strange thing about the owners of that farm . They want to fence us in up here . " " Then there 's not a chance for a road to the south , " I said . Pa stood looking at the ground , his sun-tanned face was as brown as an autumn leaf . I thought he , too , might be wondering if there was actually a chance of our ever getting a road to our house . For now we had made our farm even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comfortable place to live in . My father , mother , brother and sisters loved the only piece of earth we had ever owned ; they loved the house my grandfather and I had built with our own hands . But Nature , with her high , towering hills , was against us . And the only neighbor who owned land where there was a possible chance of our making a road was not only against our having a road over his acres but he also was against anybody 's moving over his land . During my first year home from college , I taught a rural high school at Warnock , Kentucky . When I went home , 1 walked there . When I left home , I walked away . Two college classmates visited me during my first year at home . One said , after I held the barbed wire apart for him to crawl through : " This is a funny place to get to . Jesse , I would never have thought you were from country like this when I met you in college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and then walked . After one year of teaching , I became principal of Greenup County High School . I walked from my home to the high school , for there was no other way to get there . Not unless I lived in Greenup . Two years later I was superintendent of Greenup County Schools . This was the best position a man of my profession could have in my county . Yet , I walked over paths to and from my home . I walked over land owned by other people , They gave us permission to build stiles over their fences so we would n't tear our clothes . When my father went to work or when my mother went to church , they walked over one of these paths . In 1933 , I went to the west end of Greenup County as principal of Mc-Kell High School . This was the year I sold my first short story . I had found a new pleasure and a new revenue . My brother , James , had finished high school and two years of college and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sophia , was teaching in a rural school . My baby sister was in high school . We just had to have a road to our home . Pa would n't leave the fifty acres . After all these years of struggling to get in and out , he was more determined than ever . In 1934 , I sold more stories , and for the first time in my life I put money in the bank . I , too , had ideas other than to write short stories , for my first book , Man With a Bull-Tongue Piow , was published . I was getting letters from everywhere . People were wanting to visit my home from many states . They wanted to see where I was from . On many Sundays as many as thirty visitors came to our home . They parked their cars and walked over the paths . They thought we lived in a " romantic " place . I knew if they had carried as many things on their backs for as long distances as each member of our family , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was something about the place besides its being romantic . Not one of us was willing to leave now . Because this was our home . We knew and felt deeply the beauty of our fields , woods , streams , and wild flowers in the spring , and the coloring of autumn leaves . So I put my money in the bank until I had saved nine hundred dollars . This was in 1936 , My second book , Head 0 ' W-Hollow , was published . More People were visiting us now . And those who lived not too far away and had wondered why we had ever stayed in W-Hollow visited us and found it a very beautiful place . Fifteen years had passed since we bought the land and built the house in 1921 . All the members of our family had well-developed legs . Physically , they were as durable as the oaks that grew from our soil . Walking in all sorts of weather around the ridges of the high hills had given us good lungs and good muscles . My mother often walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in the bank , twilight years ticked away for Uncle Bill
