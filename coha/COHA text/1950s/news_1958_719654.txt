txt EISENHOWER CALLS SOVIET ATOM HALT JUST ' A GIMMICK ' Says Moscow 's Suspension of Arms Tests Should Not Be Taken Seriously ' DENIES NEGATIVE STAND But He Concedes U. S. May Not Be Exploiting Its Views in Most Effective Way By E. W. KENWORTHY Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , April 2 ? President Eisenhower said today the Soviet nuclear test suspension was " a gimmick " that was " not to be taken seriously . " Amid the vast range of EastWest problems the question of test suspension is " just a side issue " that the Soviet Union has seized upon for propaganda purposes , the President said at his news conference . At the same time the President acknowledged , as Secretary of State Dulles did yesterday , that the United States probably was not presenting the case for its policies as effectively as it might . Yesterday Mr. Dulles said at his news conference that about ten days ago top officials had discussed with the President whether " to try to steal a march on the Soviets " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Dulles The idea was rejected because it was felt that " our duties " to the American people and humanity required continued tests to develop small , " clean " tactical bombs , Mr. Dulles said . Today President Eisenhower confirmed Mr. Dulles ' account of the White House meeting , saying : " We had discussed this thing as a possibility on our own side , that is , unilateral abandonment of tests , and decided that it was not good for the United States at this time . " The President took care , however , not to leave the impression that the decision had been taken in a spirit of negativism without any evaluation of the factors involved . He said : " And I want to bring this one thing out . I do n't think we are being negative when you are firm but are standing on what you believe to be the truth , the // facts , and the welfare of ' the free world , including specifically the welfare of the United States . " Later the President was asked whether " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Soviet announcement if the Administration " had announced previously that it had considered but rejected as phony a unilateral test suspension . " Me President replied : " It might have been a better propaganda move . But we looked at the whole thing as a propaganda move and because of that reason I thought that it would be better to say nothing at the moment . I could have been mistaken . I do n't say that it was n't . " Earlier Stand Recalled The President 's characterization of test suspension as a " side issue " seemed out of key with a statement he had made at his news conference last week . He was asked then about reports that the Administration might no longer insist on linking a test ban with a cutoff of nuclear production for weapons . The President replied that it would be " unwise to take , a perfectly rigid position " where any reliable agreement " would seem to be opening the door to wider and better negotiations with the Soviet Union . " However , it was believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an important element in any toplevel negotiations . After having called the Soviet announcement a " gimmick , " the President added : " But this does n't mean that ? * * we should fail to seek some common ground where there is a beginning made toward agreement in which we can work better cooperatively . " And the President said he had not abandoned hope of " a sufficient conciliatory attitude by the Soviets so that there can be a constructive summit meet-ing : , On the question of more effective presentation of United States policies , the President was asked whether any thought had been given to the re-establishment of the old psychological warfare board . From 1953 to 1956 the President had three successive advisers on the presentation of United States policy  --  C. D. Jackson of Time , Inc. ; Nelson A. Rockefeller , a former Assistant Secretary of State , and William H. Jackson , a New York investment banker . At present psychological warfare planning is assigned to the Operations Coordinating Board , whose chief function is to see that decisions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not believe a psychological warfare board was a good idea . It might be possible to put an individual in the State Department with sole responsibility for psychological warfare , - be said . As for the Psychological effect of United States policies , " it is possible we could point it up a little bit more , " he said . The President was reminded la talk earlier this year of mak- 1 ing Vice President Richard. , M. Nixon chairman of the Opdations Coordinating Board to . help the psychological warfare effort . The President said he had decided that , as a matter of good governmental organization , " it would not be correct " to give Mr. Nixon an administrative position in the executive department . The President displayed some sensitiveness to charges that the United States had allowed the initiative to slip to the Soviet Union . At one point he pulled a paper from his pocket and read a list of " the subjectSthat the United States has proposed unilaterally . " The list included the Baruch plan in 1946 for the controlled peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerial inspection of military installations ; the proposal last year on the peaceful use of outer space ; the transfer of nuclear weapons stocks to peaceful use ; freedom of travel and the limitation of the veto in the United Nations Security Council .
