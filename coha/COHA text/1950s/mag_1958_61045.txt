' WATCH OUT FOR ELMER ' // In high school football circles in the Shenandoah Valley this fall the grapevine word is , " Watch out for Elmer "  --  Elmer Lam , that is , of Elkton High . And the chances are good that , as you read this , college football scouts are packing valises ( and carpetbags ) for reconnaissance missions into the valley . Wedged between the Blue Ridge and Massanutten mountains of Virginia , they will find the town of Elkton ( pop . 1,500 ) . And in Elkton , living on the lip of a rock quarry with the sifting limestone dust and his widowed grandmother , is Elmer . And Elmer can play football in that valley about as well as Stonewall Jackson could whip Yankees . // Not that Elmer Roy Lam , a well-rounded boy , makes anything big out of football . When autumn comes to Elkton he just plays . And the 124 points he has scored or set up in the first five games for Elkton High this year are merely what comes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other particulars of his 18-year-old , 6-foot 1-inch , 165-pound existence . Elmer 's steady girl friend , Jo Ann Monger , is a cheerful cheerleader who lets Elmer buy her Pepsi-Colas and hamburgers after school . She wears his class ring ( size 9 ? ) on her size 6 finger , and he wears hers on a chain . Elmer maintains a good B average so he can go to college next fall ( Elmer and two girls are all there is to French II at Elkton ) . And he is assistant business manager of the yearbook and president of the Monogram Club . He has also lettered in track , baseball and basketball . // Last year there were 15 on the Elkton High football squad . This year , two days before the opener with a 36-man team from Winchester , there were only 10  --  and four of those were converts from the marching band . Coach Gene Giuseppe had to make a room-to-room appeal to fill out the squad . But Halfback Lam tossed four touchdown passes over the heads of Winchester , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final score was 35-0 . The next opponent , Strasburg , duly warned , smothered Elmer 's receivers ; so Elmer ran for three touchdowns and kicked two points to make it 32-0 . The next week against Dayton it was 41-0 , only this time Elmer scored all the points . " I could n't have done it without the blocking , " he said . Perhaps the scouts should look the whole team over . // CHAMPAGNE AND TWEED AT BELMONT // The $150,000 Champagne Stakes at New York 's Belmont Park , won last Saturday by First Landing with Eddie Arcaro up , is a time-honored exhibition of the best of the country 's 2-year-olds . Coming as it does at first-frost time , it is also a moment when the casual camera can catch the fall clothes that are succeeding most impressively . The chatelaines of Turf and Field Club boxes put their stamp on a new line , a trend , a mode as they move from grandstand to paddock under Belmont 's dappling oaks , carrying with them the authority of the unmistakably well dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Henry Ittleson Jr .

Then , as now , their preference for the races was tweed , but tweed worn with a difference , turned and tailored in a new fashion by the couturier 's hand . This year 's tweeds reflect the shapes of this season 's fashion : large collars , often lavishly fur-trimmed ; capes and jumpers ; abbreviated jackets and the high waist of the Empire line . // Mrs. John A. Morris wears mink-collared , abbreviated Persian lamb jacket , matching pillbox with tweed dress . Colors of husband 's racing stables are one of the country 's oldest . // Mrs. W. Horace Schmidlapp 's tweed tunic-jumper is worn over knit dress . Costume was designed by Guy Laroche. // Laura Leonard , in paddock with Robert Strawbridge of Philadelphia , wears a great cape with great collar of red Shetland tweed . // Mrs. Charlton Henry 's walking Suit is of black-and-blue tweed with yoke repeating curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the vast golden prairies of Saskatchewan is a time of harvest and of plenty . Farmers work long days in the fields of yellow wheat , combines rumble along endless swaths of new-cut grain and ducks stir restlessly on watery sloughs and potholes . Once again , in the largest waterfowl nesting area in the world , the great migration south begins , repeating an ageless cycle of flight and return . Millions of mallards , teals , pintails and baldpates lift skyward , leaving behind until spring the plains and marshes of their birth . And as they wing across Saskatchewan 's 125,000 square miles of duck-shooting country , hunters like those shown here will reap still another of autumn 's bountiful harvests . // Retrieving a bird , Jill , a 3-year-old yellow Labrador , paddles through the weed-filled waters of a slough near Wynyard , Sask. // Receiving reward for a job well done , Jill is praised by owner and ardent Saskatchewan hunter Dr. E.
