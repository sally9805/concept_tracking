Harold Ross once defiantly accepted the description of his New Yorker magazine as an " adult comic book . " This was a less-than-just verdict on the magazine that caused or charted wide changes in American humor , fiction and reporting , but it was quite in keeping with the arrogant character of Editor Ross to accept it . <P> In 26 years he made The New Yorker a synonym for urbanity , but he himself remained a bawling , rough-cut outlander from Aspen , Colo . A catty old friend , Alexander Woollcott , once described him as looking like " a dishonest Abe Lincoln . " Rumpled , wild-haired and irascible , Ross talked in an ear-splitting voice , a combination of rasp and quack . He often expressed himself in skid-row profanity , or by mere grunts or gap-toothed grins . He had the energy of a bull , and a bull-like charm . Though he often sounded as crass as a cymbal , he had an amazing sensitivity for words , a pouncing eye for the phony , a rigorous taste . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Had it not been for World War I , Harold Wallace Ross might have frittered away his career as a roistering tramp newspaperman . He left home at 18 , bummed his way for seven years from paper to paper until he enlisted in the Army during World War I. He became editor of the Army 's Stars &; Stripes , on a staff that included Woollcott , Franklin P. Adams and Grantland Rice . After the war , they forgathered in New York , where their friendship continued at poker parties of the Thanatopsis Literary &; Inside Straight Club and at the famed Round Table of wits in the Algonquin <P> Hotel . Ross edited two veterans ' magazines and the fast failing Judge ; then he decided to start his own . He persuaded a fellow poker player who had a lot of money , Raoul Fleischmann , to back him . His idea was a humorous magazine that would not be " for the old lady in Dubuque . " <P> Begun in 1925 , The New Yorker went shakily on for three years . Fleischmann poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cursed , trying to get the kind of magazine he wanted . In the first year and a half alone , about 100 staffers were fired , many with a muttered apology from Ross : " We need geniuses here . " Gradually Ross found what he needed : James Thurber , E. B. White , Ogden Nash , John O'Hara , S. J. Perelman , Peter Arno , Helen Hokinson , 0 . Soglow . <P> In the chaotic early days , pay was low . Ross himself ( who eventually got $50,000 a year ) had his salary computed every month , based on earnings . Once , when Ross was explaining things to a new managing editor , he said , " I am surrounded by idiots and children . " At that point , a copy boy burst in , shouting : " Mr. Thurber is standing on a ledge outside the window and threatening to commit suicide . " ( Actually , Thurber was merely sitting on the ledge to get a whiff of fresh air . ) Ross turned to the editor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew and became hugely successful , such anecdotes of life in The New Yorker office became the talk of the town . By insiders , its success was attributed not only to the ornery talents of its contributors but also to Ross 's " thousands and thousands of tiny prejudices . "
