For 28 years , Erwin S. Barrie has been not only director of Manhattan 's big Grand Central Art Galleries but an amateur painter as well . Last week , for the first time , he got around to hanging some of his own paintings on the walls . Onetime Amateur Golf Champion Willie Turnesa turned up at the opening ; so did dozens of other tweedy sportsmen who circled the room crowing , " I remember this one ! " and " I made that one in three . " Amateur Barrie , who called his canvases Famous Golf Holes I Have Played , could n't have been more pleased at the down-to-earth comments . <P> A trim , tanned suburbanite of 60 , Barrie divides his holidays between golf and art . He shoots in the low 80s , paints less well . His innumerable strokes of smudgy pigment often land him in the rough . But , in welcome contrast to most contemporary art , his paintings are unpretentious and done with obvious enjoyment . <P> What 's more , the pedestrian naturalism of Barrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whiff of romantic feeling . " I have allowed myself the privilege , " he says in the catalogue foreword , " of interpreting each hole in the time of day , or season of the year , that seemed most appropriate . For instance the 5th hole at Clementon , NJ. ' s Pine Valley was painted on a grey morning , after an all-night rain . Pine Valley is a rugged course , as all golfers know , and this is reached with a 218-yd. shot uphill . The green . . . is as formidable as a medieval castle . <P> " The little 11th hole at Tarrytown , N.Y . ' s Sleepy Hollow , a one-shotter of 142 yds. , is , on the other hand , attractive and gay . It is comparatively easy . The trees are soft and inviting , the reflections in the water are lyric and I have tried to give just that impression in my colorful and atmospheric interpretation of it .
