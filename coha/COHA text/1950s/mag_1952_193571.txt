In West Germany last week , Staffer Rudi Treiber of Dsseldorf 's Communist daily Freies Volk got a geography lesson . Under the headline PISTOLS AND BRASS KNUCKLES IN CLASSROOM , WEST BERLIN SCHOOLS ARE GANGSTER STUDIOS , Treiber had pointed to the school in the Pankow area of Berlin as a horrible example of just how the West brings up and trains its schoolchildren . In the Pankow school , he wrote , children have been found armed with brass knuckles and guns , while others write lewd poems which they circulate through an organization they call the " Bureau of Love . " <P> Journalist Treiber had made a dreadful mistake : Pankow is in the Russian sector of Berlin , not as he had thought in one of the Western sectors . When Freies Volk discovered Treiber 's error , it quickly printed an abject retraction : " Rudi Treiber has been unmasked and fired ... as a liar and an agent provocateur . " Said ex-Comrade Treiber lamely : " I just did n't know where Pankow was . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
