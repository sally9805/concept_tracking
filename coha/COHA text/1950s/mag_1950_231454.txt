" Times are slowly changing in Spain , " observed a Madrid physician last week . " To be a monarchist is no longer such a great crime , but the police do not realize it yet . " <P> Dictator Francisco Franco 's insensitive police had , for the fourth time in three years , arrested Dona Luisa Maria Narvaez y Macias , Duchess of Valencia , the handsome , strong-willed first lady of Spain 's monarchist movement . Before a military tribunal in Madrid last week , she faced charges of sending an anti-Franco letter to President Truman and distributing copies of it in Spain , using the mails for subversive propaganda and attempts to form a monarchist underground . <P> But the courtroom atmosphere was festive rather than grim . In marked contrast with the duchess ' last trial ( at which she was sentenced to a year in jail-TIME , Jan. 10 , 1949 ) , there were no Tommy-gun-toting guards , no uniformed cops . The presiding judge was affable , dapper Major General Miguel Rodrigo , 54-year-old commander of Spain 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade Madrid 's military governor that there were no legal grounds for a trial . <P> " Let 's call it off , " he had urged . " Luisa Maria has suffered enough . She is far too lovely to waste her life in that horrible prison . " But the governor had insisted that trial take place . In the anteroom , before the proceedings started , General Rodrigo had kissed the duchess ' hand , murmuring , " Good luck , Luisa Maria . " <P> In court , behind the duchess , sat her codefendants : a lawyer , a printshop owner , a printer and Don Bernardo Bernardez , an elderly monarchist leader and onetime banker . Having been fired from his post at the Banco Iberico , Don Bernardo deemed himself a ruined man . But as a Spanish caballero , there was one thing more he could do for Luisa Maria . He could , in spite of his wife and ten children , take the rap for the duchess . Don Bernardo stoutly denied that she had any connection with his political activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I myself am the only criminal . " <P> It took the court a few hours to acquit the duchess , sentence Don Bernardo to 18 months in jail ( two other defendants got shorter prison terms ) . After the trial , the duchess , chic and cool in a tailored grey suit and gunmetal-colored nylons , appeared on a balcony to greet the crowds waiting in the street ' below . Then she went home . She immediately sent a message to Don Juan , exiled pretender to the Spanish throne . Said she : " I have cabled my King that I am free . " <P> Later , friends admitted to her boudoir found the duchess in bed ( her doctor had ordered a complete rest ) , thoughtfully fingering a bouquet sent her by her gallant judge .
