The U.S. Supreme Court was asked to play Solomon last week in the case of two children instead of one . The question was legally knotty : To what extent should the courts let an infant 's baptism affect its future ? <P> The story the court will have to consider , if it agrees to hear the case , begins in 1947 , when Brazilian-born Jandyra Southern , a Roman Catholic , and her husband , Thomas Southern of Kansas City , a Protestant , were divorced . Jandyra Southern moved to New York , and boarded her two children , Diane and Linda , in a Jewish foster home . Later they were put in the care of the Free Synagogue Child Adoption Committee in Manhattan . For reasons Mrs. Southern has never explained , she declared that she and her children were Jews . <P> Last year , Jandyra Southern asked for her children . She had lied in calling Diane and Linda Jewish , she said ; they had both been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church . The New York children 's court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in their foster home because there they had found " happiness , love and security " for the first time in their lives , and because they did not remember ever being anything but Jewish . The court also found Jandyra Southern " unfit to have their custody or control . " <P> Jandyra Southern appealed . The appellate division of the New York supreme court reversed the children 's court and ordered Diane , 8 , and Linda , 7 , moved to the Catholic Home Bureau for Dependent Children . Jandyra , who had hoped for custody of the children herself , began to suffer from another acute case of indecision . She told the Jewish agency that she was content to let the children stay in their Jewish foster home , then reversed herself and authorized Lawyer George A. Timone , prominent in New York Catholic charities , to act as her attorney and see that the children were transferred to the Catholic Home Bureau . <P> Last week , in what may be a precedent-making case , the Jewish agency filed an appeal in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to test the appellate division 's decision in the New York court of appeals . The agency 's contention : the decision violates the principle of church-state separation by determining custody of a child " not with reference to its welfare but solely on the basis of the religion into which it was baptized , " thereby " giving legal sanction to the baptism .
