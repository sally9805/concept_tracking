Last week in Manhattan , specialists in the " neurosis " and the " cure " announced the formation of a combined National Academy of Religion and Mental Health . Its aims : to promote the establishment of psychiatry departments in theological seminaries and to sponsor research in the area where religion and psychiatry seem to overlap , e.g. , " What religious phenomena are pathological ? " <P> Brushing aside Freud 's dictum as a matter of semantics and logic-chopping , Academy President Kenneth Ellmaker Appel. a Philadelphia psychiatrist , set the tone for the academy 's work : " A hundred million Americans the estimated enrollment in churches ca n't be wrong . Church membership is helping people to live more worthwhile and satisfying lives . " * Mental health , he said , is inseparably intertwined with questions of moral values , as well as with feelings of guilt , anxiety and insecurity . Said Executive Director George C. Anderson , associate chaplain at Manhattan 's St. Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , teaching Sunday schools and preaching in pulpits , can foster healthy emotional attitudes if they have some knowledge of emotional dynamics . They can bring about a more realistic attitude toward guilt , with less emphasis on sin while still recognizing its importance . " <P> <P> The academy 's backers include former presidents of the American Psychiatric Association and ministers of the Protestant ( among them , Theologian Paul Tillich ) , Roman Catholic and Jewish faiths . <P> <P> * He also might have quoted Freud , who can be accused of facing both ways : " Religious piety stifles neurosis .
