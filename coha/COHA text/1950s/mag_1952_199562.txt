Morning fog slithered through the cobbled streets when the first of the 200,000 men , women &; children funneled into the old cathedral town of Durham . In a noisy , hilarious parade , they cascaded through the streets to the old abandoned race course , where every year the coal miners of Durham County quaff free beer and quiver at oratory at their annual Miners ' Gala ( pronounced gayler ) . <P> Romping past the Royal County Hotel , the paraders roused the day 's distinguished guest-that horny veteran of the pits and stormy rebel of the Labor Party , Aneurin Bevan himself . Past his hotel balcony streamed rugged oldtimers who well remembered the " bad old days " Nye Bevan liked so much to talk about , and younger , well-dressed miners and their ladies , with pockets bulging with money-more than enough for each to take a holiday to Paris . <P> <P> Nye Bevan stood on the hotel balcony and took the salutes . A child , pink-faced and pudgy like himself , skipped past and Bevan pointed with a laugh : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> On to the gala grounds went Aneurin Bevan to provide the kind of fighting oratory that goes with the Miners ' Gala the way bubble goes with squeak . Girls with hats bearing mottoes , " Cuddle me quick " or " It 's now or never , " stormed the distinguished guest with autograph books . Miners pranced past with placards that told of deprivations of the past and displayed likenesses of men who had helped in the climb from poverty . All that seemed far away in happy Durham : today miners are a privileged class in Britain . Because Britain so badly needs them , they get better rations and more government benefits than any other group in the land , while Britannia figuratively begs them to help save her from the shame of bankruptcy by mining just 10% more coal . <P> Nye Bevan wagged a pudgy finger at the crowd and said : " We have opportunities our forefathers never had . Thanks to Socialism , the bad old days are behind us , new urgencies press upon us , but ordinary men and ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just that we ca n't afford the luxury of a Tory government . The most patriotic thing Churchill can do is to resign next week . " <P> The miners drank it up . They had money in their pockets , free chits for beer in their hands , and the pubs were mercifully endowed with special all-day licenses . " Fill your lungs with good Durham air before you fill your bellies with good beer , " advised Nye , " and before you drink , let 's have three cheers for the Labor Party . " And so they did .
