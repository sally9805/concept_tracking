IN TERMS of Dr. Warner 's marital possibilities Point of No Return is the story of a man who might have married out of his class but did n't . Look at the structure of the novel . In Part I we see Charley Gray in 1947 , a member of the lower-upper class in the New York-Westchester sector who is fighting tooth and nail to maintain his social position , spurred on by an ambitious wife . The question is whether Charles is going to become vice president of the bank in which he works , and it is a vital question to Charles and , even more , to Nancy . Then , by one of Marquand 's more ingenious contrivances , we are back in Clyde in Charles 's young manhood , when he was in love with Jessica Lovell , an upper-upper . The Grays were lower-upper , and precariously so , in spite of ancestors and connections , for Charley 's father had a talent for losing money . We know that Charley is n't going to marry Jessica , who is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and we know that he is going to marry Nancy , whom we have seen to be something of a nagger . It all happens : Mr. Lovell breaks the engagement ; Charley leaves Clyde and goes to work in New York ; he meets Nancy . But then it turns out that Nancy " really was a Spruce Street girl . " ( The Grays live on Spruce Street , in Clyde , not on the Lovells ' upper-upper Johnson Street . ) She is , in short , the right kind of wife for Charley , good for him in a way that Jessica could never have been . The Grays , we realize , are representative Americans , fighting their way upward together , doing their best in the world as they find it . By means of this reversal , Marquand makes the reader ? even this reader ? care whether ? Charles Gray gets to be a vice president of the Stuyvesant Bank . In Point of No Return , Marquand not only has a lot of fun with the sociologists ; he beats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clyde tell us more about a well-integrated , reasonably autonomous community with a population under 20,000 than we are likely to learn from the Yankee City series . If , like Charley Gray , he scoffs at the sociologists ' generalizations , he knows what he sees with his own eyes . If the social structure of Newbury-port , to say nothing of New York City , is too complex and too subtly defined to be reduced to a diagram , it has its own kind of reality . Marquand 's understanding of that reality is an important element in his success as a novelist of manners . III II jict : most novelists of manners , Marquand is often satirical , though satire is less prominent in ' his work than some critics , probably misled by The Late George Apley , have assumed . He has satirized advertising agencies , the slick magazines , omniscient correspondents and commentators . He has polished off the country club set , the Fairfield County intelligentsia , the hangers-on of the New Deal , the soft professors . No one can do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table or bedroom , and some of his funniest scenes , such as the account of the Pulliam family 's return from a summer in Maine ? " I had always believed in - assuming that a motor trip with the children would be pretty bad , but actually that trip was worse " ? grow out of the trivia of domestic life . As a rule , he aims at fair and not very difficult game . His great gift is for accurate reporting ? his eye is as good as Sinclair Lewis 's at its best , and his ear is more dependable than Lewis 's ever was ? and he achieves his finest results with only a slight heightening of effect . He is not a crusader , has no great store of indignation , is likely to temper his roughest blast with pity . Towards persons of established social position ? the upper-uppers , as Warner would say ? he has an attitude of amused respect . It is true that he has n't much to say for the Brills in Wickford Point , but they are aristocrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , diverting as he finds their behavior on occasion , he has a warm regard ? even for George and certainly for his father and uncle . As a person who knows the system and yet stands outside it , he can render the comedy in the shaping of a George Apley , but he has no desire to repudiate all the Apley standards . If anything , Marquand has a bias in favor of upper-class values . Harry Pulliam , with all his limitations , is obviously a better person , more honorable , more useful , happier , than Bill King , the Harvard boy from the wrong side of the tracks who becomes a successful advertising man . Bob Tasmin , the upper-class lawyer whom B. F. 's daughter almost married , turns out to be vastly more admirable than the middle-class college professor whom Polly does marry . And in So Little Time , Jeff Wilson , knowing that he is going to be a hack the rest of his life , looks up , not to some dramatist who has succeeded where he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever knew . Born into one of the old Newburyport families and into a good deal of luxury , Marquand was headed for Groton , but his father lost heavily in the panic of 1907 , and he went to Newburyport High School instead . ( He lived with his Newburyport aunts while his father was working on the Panama Canal . ) He did get to Harvard , but only by virtue of scholarships and with very little money in his pockets . He learned to make money with his typewriter , and , as he has observed , he needed to , since he was married to a Sedgwick . They were divorced in 1935 , and two years later he married Adelaide Hooker , a connection of the Rockefellers . All this may explain the ambivalence of his attitude towards the values of the upper class . He has never forgotten , however , that the values of the upper-uppers , like everyone else 's , are subject to the corrosive influence of time . The Apleys must change or perish . Jeff Wilson , much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a little outmoded . a little dry and sterile . " Even for a Bob Tasmin , the most Marquand can say is that his values may be as good as any we can find in this confused world . " We 're like fish being moved from one aquarium to another , " one of the characters in B.F. 's Daughter says . " We were in one body of water , and now we 're in another , but everything is moving so fast I ca n't remember what it used to be like . " Tasmin writes his wife from the Pacific theater of war : " We were all taught to expect something different ? I do n't know exactly what and I wish I did . " Many of Marquand 's characters are nostalgic for times and places in which values were fixed , but , as Harry and his wife say at the end of H. M. Pulham , Esquire , and as someone is always implying in Marquand 's novels , " We ca n't go back . " T is because Marquand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not merely to people but also to their valuesthat all of his major novels move back and forth between present and past . He is wonderfully adroit in the use of the flashback , and , especially in H. M. Fulham. , Esquire and Point of No Return , has solved . with great . ingenuity the problem of bringing the past into the present . His sense of time is even more precise than his sense of place or his sense of class . He knows the past thirty-five years ? on the social planes and in the places with which he is concerned ? as unerringly as one of Mark Twain 's pilots knew the Mississippi River . A serious anachronism in one of his books is almost unthinkable , not because he is a pedantic researcher but because his feeling for time approaches infallibility . Marquand 's heroes are always confused and usually conscious of their confusion . He once defined his typical hero as " the badgered American male ? and that includes me ? fighting for a little happiness and always crushed by the problems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Marquand has never pretended that he was any clearer on the problem of values than the people lie is writing about . ( That is why he can not be in any fundamental sense a satirist . ) He sees that the people who have clear-cut standards often make mistakes , but so do those who have n't , and the mistakes of the latter are often worse . There are a few fools in Marquand 's novels , but there are no wise men . In Point of No Return Marquand suggests that perhaps the only thing to do is to accept things as they are . Charles Gray says to Nancy , " We 're part of a system where there 's always someone waiting to kick you in the teeth in a nice way , " and Nancy replies , " It 's a rotten system . " But what , Mr. Marquand asks , is better ? Not anything , certainly , that Clyde might have offered . And are the Grays so badly off ? They have each other , and , like most Marquand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have their children , their home , their social position . They have their fight for success , and , as it turns out they have their victory . Marquand barely alludes to what the Grays would have if they lost the fight , but he does admit with complete candor that what they have won is an ample distance this side of Paradise . But , he asks again , is there anything better ? If there is , he has not shown it in this novel or in any other . MARQUAND OF IV I TAKE a dim view of all serious critics , " Marquand has said . " I do n't know any who 've had a kind word to say for me , ever since I was a little boy . " This , of course , is exaggeration . Elmer Davis suggested , way back in 1933 , that Jahn P. Marquand was a man to be reckoned with . In 1941 Herschel Brickell wrote a laudatory article about Marquand and Ellen Glasgow in the Virginia Quarterly Review . That same year Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not without some apologies , among the eight major novelists he discussed in American Fiction , 1920-1940 . Other respectable critics have spoken warmly of Marquand , but he has reason for feeling that he has been shabbily treated . In last year 's Literary History of the United States , a large-scale venture in co-operative scholarship , he was not given an individual bibliography , although the works of Erskine Caldwell , Zona Gale , William Saroyan , and Upton Sinclair ; to mention but a few , were duly listed ; and he was not even mentioned in the principal chapter on contemporary fiction . Nobody writes articles about him in the highbrow magazines , and the more esoteric critics of fiction rarely bother to review his books . He has not even the satisfaction of being lanibasted by the highbrows , as Faulkner and Hemingway and Dos Passos perennially are ; he is ignored . The reasons for this neglect are obvious : academic critics are shocked because he has written so much for the slicks , and highbrow critics distrust him because his novels sell by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academicians ? / mean , to be sure , the had academicians ? because he fits no category and illustrates no trend . The highbrows can not damn him to the greater glory of Henry James , or praise him in disparagement of Ernest Hemingway . There is a feeling that Mr. Marquand has his reward , and may be left to Life , Time , and the Book-of-the-Month Club Bulletin . Yet the serious critics ought at least to recognize the efficiency with which Marquand does the things he wants to do . I have spoken , for instance . of the skill with which he moves backward and forward in time , never better exhibited than in the preparation for Charles Gray 's revisitation of Clyde in Point of No Return . One sees , on close examination , that the thing is contrived , but one is scarcely aware of the contrivance on first reading and can find nothing wrong with it on second or third . Or , as an example of his economy , take the first chapter of B. F. 's Daughter , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father is ill , and makes a precipitate return to New York . In eighteen pages of apparently offhand narrative , we come to know that Polly is rich , that she has intellectual pretensions , that her husband is a heel , that she is deeply attached to her father , and that she is a good deal like him . Those pages could be used anywhere as a model of painless exposition . It is sometimes said that Marquand 's range is narrow , but actually he works in as spacious a territory as most of his contemporaries ; it merely happens to be different . The upper-uppers and even the lower-uppers have been largely neglected in cm-rent literature , partly at any rate because most of our novelists have come from the middle segments of our society . Marquand has had excellent opportunities for observation of the upper groups , being identified with them and yet detached from them both by elements in his early experience and by professional interests . Many Americans deny the existence of class stratification , adhering either to the myth of perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but Marquand knows how complex our social structure is , and his mastery of the subtler gradations has provided the basis not only for comedy but also for a good deal of drama . American-society , even in Boston , is too mobile to lend itself to the particular kind of drama that was Anthony Trollope 's stock in trade , but Marquand gets some of the same effects . He has a world of his own , and it is an important world . vJ AG of Marquand 's six serious novels has been a best seller , and Point of No Return stood at the top of the list for month after month . Why ? His books have none of the conventional attributes of the best seller ? no sensational sex , no burning social issues , no harrowing adventures , no religious message . They deal with lawyers , stockbrokers , bankers , manufacturers , and writers . His heroes are not in the least heroic ; they arc badgered American males , often inarticulate and sometimes ineffectual . No murders take place , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married couples than they are with the ecstasies of lovers . The people are everyday people , and they live in an everyday world , which Marquand describes in painstaking detail . To say all this is not to suggest that Marquand is one of those writers who are obdurately indifferent to the demands of the reading public . He has always known what the customers want , and he still is ready to give it to them whenever he can . Since he does not choose to capitalize on the demand for sensational sex , he is quite willing to make the most of the demand for propriety : he cleans up the language of his characters , and he skirts situations that a bolder kind of realist would feel obliged to confront . If lie can not supply happy endings , he falls back on his worldliness and his literary skill to make resignation palatable . And if he has no solution to offer to his reader 's problems , he knows how to make the reader feel that the lack of a solution is a mark of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , if that is what they should be called , do not measurably lessen the value of his work , nor do they explain its popularity . Obviously there must be a powerful demand for what Marquand gives ? an intimate , detailed , credible account of the way ixt which . theupper classes of the northeastern United States live . It is not enough to say that Marquand 's readers have risen or hope to rise into the ranks of the prosperous and socially accepted . One has to take into account the revolution in social relationships and ? moral values-that is , in one way or another , the theme of all Marquand 's novels . As a result of this revolution , fewer and fewer people acquire clearly defined standards in childhood , and those who do are more and more likely to find their standards irrelevant . Increasingly our patterns of conduct are determined by observation of the way other people behave ? often by vicarious observation , through movies , plays , and novels . There is not much help for us in the novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is in the cleavage-and-dagger romances , to which we turn for something else anyway , but there is a good deal of helpin Marquand . Here we can discover what the values are for which there is a current market demand . T uts hypothesis should not be regarded as disparaging to either Mr. Marquand or his readers . It is merely an attempt to explain why hundreds of thousands of people are intensely interested in novels that , according to most theories about the publishing business , ought to leave them cold . That other readers read Marquand for other reasons , that these readers find other values in him , ought not to need saying . Moreover , it is precisely Marquand 's human insight ? that makes him useful as a guide to behavior , if that is what he is . As I have been trying to say , he is a social novelist of great talent , and neither his slick past nor his successful present should blind us to that fact . It is true that he keeps close to the surface , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger writers , who plunge deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the human personality . On the surface , however ; he has a mastery that is not to be underestimated . The world that Marquand gives us in his novels is one in which the rules are enormously important , and yet one no sooner learns them than they change . It is a world in which there are few spectacular tragedies and a good deal of quiet desperation , in which there are few ecstasies but many little satisfactions . It is a world so full of confusion that only stupid people like Malcolm Bryant and ? Tom Brett and Walter Newcome believe they understand it , and they fool themselves only part of the time . One may argue that Marquand has been all too ready to give in to confusion , to say that problems are insoluble , to abandon the search for better values than those that inhere in things as they are . Like most of his characters , though not the characters he most admires , he has been governed by the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never know whether or not he could have had a whole loaf if he had tried . Such reservations , however , may be left to time , that element whose power he has so often acknowledged . For his own era , he speaks with genuine authority , and he speaks to it , as his millions of readers demonstrate , with singular persuasiveness .
