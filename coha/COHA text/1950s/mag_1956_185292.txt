It 's a sorta habit , the tropics ; <P> It gets you worse than rum . You get away and you swear you 'll stay , <P> But she calls and back you come . <P> - From an old ballad <P> The day he stepped off a ship in the Panamanian town of Coln , the tropics got Max Bilgray , a Chicago barkeep done out of a living by the Volstead Act . That was 35 years ago , and Bilgray never even tried to get away . He became , instead , the best-known saloonkeeper in Caribbean latitudes , the boss of Coln 's far-famed Tropic Bar and Restaurant . This New Year 's , Bilgray 's customers will as usual wrap their hands around their holiday glasses of whisky in the bar on the narrow street Coln calls Bottle Alley , but Bilgray will not be leaning approvingly over his corner table . At 70 , in failing health , Max Bilgray has sold out . <P> Hard Drinking . Saloonkeeper Bilgray earned his fame by making the Tropic into a serious drinkingman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its sights and sounds were shiny brass , dark wood panels , man-to-man talk and softly whirling fans . <P> Night and day-for the Tropic closes only on Panama 's election days-customers came and went : freighter captains , Navy C.P.O.s , Panama Presidents and judges , pugs , policemen and passing yachtsmen . A young U.S. Army officer named Dwight Eisenhower once cashed his paycheck there ; Argentina 's exiled ex-President Juan Pern has dropped in lately . In the early ' 30s Aimee Semple McPherson , the thrice-divorced Foursquare Gospelbinder , visited Belgray 's incognito . <P> Bilgray created a " Hallelujah " cocktail in her honor , causing her husband of the moment , Singer David Hutton , to start a suit for $1,000,000 ( which he dropped after a satisfactory flurry of headlines ) . <P> Soft Touch . To Isthmians , Bilgray has always been a generous citizen as well as a storied saloonkeeper . He shelled out thousands to the needy , fed the down-and-out with the Tropic 's free lunch , paid fares home for the stranded , lent as much as $5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning $40,000 in old chits . But when a sob story sounded phony , vinegary Max Bilgray could also summon a waiter and say coldly : " Bring Mr. Smith the key to the crying room . " In a warm salute to Bilgray , President Ricardo ( " Dickie " ) Arias recently drove across the isthmus and awarded him Panama 's Order of Vasco Nuez de Balboa-doubtless a unique honor for a saloonkeeper . Bilgray will not leave Panama now that he has retired ; he intends to live out his days in Coln until# &151; <P> The spell of the tropics gathers the pile , <P> And the Dealer takes it all .
