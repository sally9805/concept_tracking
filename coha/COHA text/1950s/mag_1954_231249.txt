ONE August night in 1943 , a British bomb fell on the little refectory of Milan 's Santa Maria delle Grazie . Next day Milanese climbed out of their shelters to behold what seemed almost a miracle : the two side walls of the refectory had collapsed , but the north and south walls still stood-like playing cards on edge . The Last Supper , Leonardo da Vinci 's masterpiece , remained intact under the sandbags protecting the north wall . <P> Two years later the rest of the refectory was rebuilt , and the sandbags removed . But the mural was obscured by a newly formed crust of white mold , brought on by long contact with the rain-dampened sandbags . A fingertip touch would dent the pasty surface , and there seemed no way of removing the mold without flaking off the picture as well . The world had seen the last , apparently , of the Last Supper . <P> Meanwhile , a new shellac which was colorless , waxless and impervious to moisture had been developed in Britain . Deciding that they had little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shellac into the rotting wall . Within a year the mold had entirely dried up , and the painting remained . <P> Blots &; Bandages . Still , it was quite unlike the picture Leonardo was believed to have painted . Milan 's cold and damp winter wind ( which her opera stars survive by will alone ) had been whining at the wall that held the mural for 450 seasons . In Leonardo 's own lifetime the wall began to show splotches of dampness . Over the centuries , well-meaning restorers flattened out blisters and bandaged the picture 's cracks with liberal applications of plaster , painted over to resemble the chilblained masterpiece beneath . Five separate times , at least , alien hands overlaid Leonardo 's mural . <P> But now that the picture was altogether dry , the possibility occurred , for the first time , of scraping it down to what Leonardo himself had painted . X rays are useless with frescoes , so no one knew quite what the result would be . but after bitter controversy , a brilliant restorer named Mauro Pelliccioli was commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , May 4 , 1953 ) . The job took him three years and is now at last finished . The completely cleaned painting is reproduced , for the first time anywhere , on the following pages. * <P> Among the first to approve the restoration was the ancient Expertizer of Renaissance Art , Bernard Berenson , 89 , who climbed a scaffold to examine the picture minutely . He reported afterwards : " I felt that I had touched bottom . . . and that I was gazing on the true painting of Leonardo , spoiled , to be sure , by the centuries , but no longer smeared by incompetent hands . At a few yards . . . the figures emerged as if from a mist , large and imposing . Space was full of their presence . "
