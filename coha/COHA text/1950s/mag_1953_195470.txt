The first lesson in the Sunday service at the Church of St. James the Apostle in the Essex village of Greenstead Green was read to the congregation by that distinguished parishioner , Chancellor of the Exchequer Richard Austen ( " Rab " ) Butler . The text was from Isaiah . " How beautiful upon the mountains , " read Butler , " are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings ... of good . " <P> Two days later , on Budget Day , Rab Butler rose in the House of Commons and passed out to Britons the best economic tidings in years : <P> For the first time since 1929 , the government proposed not only to impose no new taxes but to reduce present taxes . There would be more free enterprise . Great Britain , said Butler , will " step out from the confines of restriction to the almost forgotten but beckoning prospects of freer endeavor and greater reward for effort . " <P> <P> Frosting Last . Butler did not prematurely betray the news that lay in the battered red dispatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury to Commons . Before the House , he went at it as a boy eats cake-saving the sugariest bits of frosting until last . <P> " The account I gave last year , " began Butler , " was , inevitably , a bleak one . . . The difference today is very striking . " Britain 's balance of payments had been converted from a 1951 deficit of 398 million to a 1952 surplus of 291 million . Gold and dollar reserves at the end of March had climbed to 774 million ( a great improvement , but still only about a quarter of what Britain should have as leader and banker of the sterling area ) . Now came a reward : H.M. 's government was about to add two ounces a week to the Briton 's sugar ration , and soon would be able to abandon sugar rationing entirely . Rab Butler accepted the pleased outcries with one of his rare smiles . <P> Lightening the Ship . Great Britain is still in economic peril , he went on . In fact , he had to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his last budget , but of lucky breaks in the flow of world economics . Butler 's estimates last year had , in fact , proved ludicrously wrong ( he had figured on a surplus of 510 million and had realized only 88 million ) . Britain was faced , as brutally as ever , with the choice of producing more and selling more overseas or perishing . <P> " We can , and we must , do much better , " said Butler . But the time had come , he went on , when " doing better " could be accomplished not through more government controls and interventions , but through more incentives for production , savings and investment . " We must get out of the slack water , lighten the ship and give her way , " the Chancellor said . <P> While Tories squirmed with delight and
