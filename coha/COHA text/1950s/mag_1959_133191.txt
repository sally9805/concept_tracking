The hunt for a boxing man of experience  --  and , if it be not contradictory , innocence  --  to promote Heavyweight Champion Ingemar Johansson 's first title defense seemed on a hot scent for a few hours in Gothenburg , Sweden last week . Then the scent cooled . // Joe Tepper , aspiring promoter of the hour , a New Yorker who burps enthusiasm in long and frequent bursts , jetted across the Atlantic to Gothenburg , Ingemar 's home town , and prayerfully presented his credentials to the champion and the champion 's adviser , Edwin Ahlquist , Scandinavia 's foremost boxing promoter . The credentials included Tepper 's love for boxing , a brief career as amateur fighter and professional corner man , some years as a functionary of the New York State boxing commission , the persuasion that his current lack of means bespeaks a scrupulously honest past and a list of impressively reputable men who would put up the money . // The list , Tepper told them , included Stephen Masters , pioneer of the discount-house approach to retail selling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke , former ambassador to El Salvador and president of the International Rescue Committee , devoted to the rescue of persons from behind the Iron Curtain ; and Thomas E. Murray Jr. , son of the former member of the Atomic Energy Commission . Bill Shea , who heads the movement to form a third major baseball league , was enlisted to serve as legal counsel for the promoters . // Every last one of them is an active Democrat , and that is how Tepper , a Lower East Side boy who grew up in idolatry of Benny Leonard , met them . Gifted at organizing sound trucks and getting them rolling on the right streets of New York , he was a useful worker in Averell Harriman 's campaigns for governor and the Democratic presidential nomination . // In presenting his case Joe Tepper leaned perhaps too heavily on these names , unaware that Ingemar would be unimpressed by their prestige but knowing that the champion is determined to let no one resembling Tony ( Fat ) Salerno , the East Harlem racketeer involved in the promotion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with the projected return bout . Last week Tony Fat escaped extradition from Florida to New York on a Florida judge 's very curiously technical decision that Tony ( shown in sullen arrogance on the opposite page as he awaited the decision ) would have to pass through Georgia on the way , thus balking New York District Attorney Frank Hogan 's plan to have Salerno tell a grand jury the extent and nature of his involvement in the promotion . It was the discovery of Salerno in the background of the first promotion that set Ingemar on his search for a new and impeccable promoter . // For more than an hour the champion and Ahlquist listened  --  it is hard to do anything else in Joe Tepper 's company  --  in the swank privacy of the Park Avenue Hotel 's KAK Room ( KAK are the initials of Sweden 's Royal Automobile Club ) . They emerged , Tepper still smiling , to report no substantial progress . // While Ingemar , in scarlet shirt and scarlet socks , sat otherwise quietly , Tepper told an international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that nothing can be done until we know what 's happening in New York . " // That was a reference to the revocation of Cus D'Amato 's right to manage Floyd Patterson , to the precarious legal status of Ingemar 's provisional contract with whatever may remain of Rosensohn Enterprises , promoter of the first Johansson-Patterson fight , and to the sum of $152,000 still due Ingemar from the proceeds of that fight . Ingemar 's money was put in escrow to guarantee that he would meet Patterson in a return match , then was released a few days ago by the New York boxing commission , which also revoked the Rosensohn Enterprises license . But D'Amato announced he would sue to keep the money in escrow. // All this was quite enough to immobilize any sensible effort toward promoting a fight . Joe Tepper was not , however , immobilized . He is a man of sometimes erratic but nevertheless incessant action . To see him cross a hotel lobby is to see a rudderless sloop tacking in variable winds . He starts for the concierge 's desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the newsstand . Sometimes he trots for a few paces , then halts suddenly . When he starts up again he lunges. // The announcement to the Swedish press that no commitments were going to be made for a while was logical but , nevertheless , a letdown . Tepper , with headlong cheerfulness , promised that on the following Tuesday he would announce the names of his backers in New York . The names , however , were already being bruited from Gothenburg to Gotham. // Joe Tepper insisted his setback was only temporary , and , in fact , he remained a reasonably good prospect to promote the second Johansson-Patterson fight , if only because he has a reputation for honesty and a total lack of criminal associations . His principal handicap is Johansson 's antipathy for persons who talk as long and hard and relentlessly as Joe Tepper . But that is not insurmountable if the champion is otherwise satisfied . // A cool head in the ring or in a business conference , and a man with a profound sympathy for the problems of prizefighters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent for his next fight , partly because he expects the match to draw the best of any that can be arranged but also because he has a sincere admiration for Patterson as a man . Patterson has made no excuses for being knocked out , has made no attempt to disparage Johansson 's victory as the mere result of a lucky punch . The former champion has maintained a decent and dignified silence ever since the fight , and Johansson , a quiet man himself , respects him for it . // When Tepper announced that a consummation in Gothenburg was impossible without clarification of the New York situation , he paused as if for once that was all he had to say . Ahlquist prompted him . // " You forget something , " Ahlquist said . // Tepper looked blank , but Ingemar knew what Ahlquist meant . // " There is going to be a fight with Patterson , " Ingemar said firmly , " I do n't know if Tepper will promote , but one thing I know  --  it will be Floyd Patterson . Floyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is null and void I am standing by my promise . Floyd Patterson is a nice boy and they are not taking his license away , even though they take away D'Amato's. " // Neither Johansson nor Ahlquist seemed to care particularly whether Tepper promotes the fight or who his backers are . Ahlquist pointedly told the Gothenburg press that " it is unimportant what the names of the backers are because there is plenty of Swedish money available here and in America to promote the fight . " // Granted that Tepper or another suitable promoter can be found , the fight will take place in New York next June . If Johansson wins the return bout the chances are that he will make his second defense in Gothenburg at the very modern Nya Ullevi Stadium , possibly against Zora Folley , ranked No. 2 behind Patterson . Ahlquist believes that such a fight in September would warrant $100 ringside tickets , draw $1,200,000 at the gate alone and sell out the 60,000 seats in a couple of weeks . On the night that Johansson knocked out top-ranked Eddie Machen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a challenger , the stadium was almost filled . Now that he is champion , Sweden 's very first , it would seem that Ahlquist is not just being optimistic . // Johansson , letting promotional nature take its course , starts a Caribbean and Latin American exhibition tour at Ciudad Trujillo on December 2 , winding up at Trinidad in mid-December . While this is going on , Ahlquist may well turn up in New York to look at Joe Tepper on his native soil and discuss affairs of state with Joe 's potential backers .
