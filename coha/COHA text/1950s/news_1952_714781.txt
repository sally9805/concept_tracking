txt The seat beside me certainly was vacant when the band at the far end of the immense convention hall burst into amplified melodic thunder in the wait for the vote on the seating of contested delegates from the South . But when I turned around , a stranger was sitting there  --  a big chap , with a mustache and with glasses that glittered somehow familiarly , though for the moment I could n't recall him . Everybody sits beside everybody at a political convention , but I must admit the button in his lapel and his badge were unfamiliar to me . The emblem seemed to be a cow or an elk or something like that . But here again you get used to practically everything at a convention . The noise was deafening , and it was hard to hear what he was saying . " Magnificent ! " he exclaimed , looking around at the enormous hall with its lights , sound , smoke , and atmosphere as it seemed to tremble with the effluvia or political emotions and partis- anship . He sniffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it going , hah ? " he demanded . " How 's the battle going ? " " You mean the fight over the Southern delegates ? Why , I think the Republican Party after 40 years is finally going to rule out the tied delegates in the South and give the party an atmosphere of reality . " He flashed a great big smile at me , one of the biggest , most powerful smiles I ever saw , that about Rhinos . " What , " I said , " 1 could n't hear you for the band ? " " I would rather see this night , " he exclaimed , " than shoot a charging rhino in Africa . Ever shoot rhinos ? " he demanded suddenly . " No , sir  --  never , " I said . I tried to turn it off with a laugh . " I 'm more used to elephants and donkeys . " " Symbols , " he said , " the same old symbols . Ever hear of another one  --  do they use it any more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintively , " the Bull Moose ? ' " Oh , that ! " I said . " That was the old party . in 1912 , was n't it ? Did n't they have something to do with contested southern delegates too ? " The big jaw shot out , I swear , two inches . " They did , " he shouted , " they did ! Forty years ago to the month , and in this same city . That Root-150 contests were filed with him and he found for the machine in every one . " His voice sank for a moment into a sort of reverie . " Elihu Root , " he repeated to himself . " They had to protect him with chicken wire . " There was n't much to say . Besides , I was trying to get back to taking notes . " You 've been around a long time , " I said . " I 've been around 40 years for this night ! " he exclaimed again in that way he had which was really rather tremendous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a sort of savage joy . " Well , " I said , just to say something , " it looks as though the national committee were going to be overruled . That 's the temper of the convention . " Prepared to Bolt He gave a great roar of boyish pleasure . " Splendid , " he exclaimed . " And if they do n't beat the national committee , they should walk out . Yes , rise and walk out ? all 500 of them ? and if the Taft forces call it-bolting , let ' em ! This is a moral issue , my friend , and we must stick to our guns the way we did when we landed against the enemy . " " You mean D-Day ? Were you there ? " The band struck up then , but he was saying something about a hill , San Juan or something like that . It 'll be a tough blow for Taft , " I said , putting a new roll of Western Union paper in my portable . " I 'll regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friend once . Many a good laugh we 've had together at those Democrats . " " Friend , eh ? " I asked . " We were till I took that African trip . Then everything got chilly . That 's the way it is in politics . But at heart he 's a jolly fellow , is Bill  --  a good man at heart . " " Bill ? " I said , " You mean Bob , do n't you ? " ? He looked uncomprehending . There was a great roar of noise . There were hisses and boos and applause and the pandemonium from the galleries as the historic decision approached  --  the issue that has plagued the Republican Party ever since the 1912 Republican split that ultimately gave William Howard Taft only two states and put Woodrow Wilson in the White House . I had to be rude , I could n't help it . " Sorry , " I said , " but I 've got to work . You do n't realize it , but a lot of people around here have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here tonight . " There was the flashing . grin again . " Reporters ! " he exclaimed , as though delighted , " they have n't changed a hair ! You from the New York World  --  or the Boston Transcript , maybe ? " " Goodness , no , why those papers ended long ago . " He did n't seem to hear me . He said : " And you say Taft is being licked ? " " I think so  --  sir , " I said , somehow adding the " sir " involuntarily . ' Bully , Bully ' He rubbed his hands with spasmodic glee . " Deelighted ! " he exclaimed . " We stand at Armageddon and we battle for the Lord ! " " What ? " I exclaimed . " Bully ! Bully , " he answered . He was gone when I had written my new lead , though as the vote occurred I had the strangest sensation that I could still hear him . In a big , deep voice  --  deeper than the , organ  --  he seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . the Republic " Mine eyes have seen the glory . " . .. The vote on the first test was 607 to 531 to unseat the first of Senator Robert ? A. Taft 's con-. tested southern delegates .
