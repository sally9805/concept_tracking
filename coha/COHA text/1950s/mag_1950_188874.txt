Conductor Karl Boehm of the touring Vienna State Opera was hot , tired and in no mood to audition the unknown young American bass-baritone who waited for him . Nevertheless , after rehearsal on a June day in Brussels , he called for the young hopeful . In the audition he made what seemed last week to be the operatic find of the year . <P> In four months , tall , boyish-looking George London , 29 , had become the rage of Vienna . Ever since he had first loosed his wide-ranged voice as Amonasro in A'ida , it seemed he could do no wrong . He had sung his first Mephistopheles in Faust , his first Escamillo in Carmen , his first Prince Galitsky in Prince Igor to bravos from the galleries and raves from the critics . When he sang the four baritone roles of Lindorf , Coppelius , Dappertutto and Doctor Miracle in Tales of Hoffman , there was a ten-minute ovation . Cracked one Austrian , as two Red army officers walked briskly from the opera house : " They 're hurrying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Deep &; Woolly . Although his parents were Russian immigrants , Montreal-born George London ( real name Burnson ) knew no Russian , never needed any until the Vienna Opera assigned him his biggest role . Last month , after studying hard , he sang a fine Boris Godunov-in the first full-dress performance ever sung in Russian by an American . It was his biggest hit yet . Even Vienna 's senior critic , Heinrich Kralik , had to concede : " He is not yet Chaliapin , but he 's very remarkable . " <P> George London 's parents moved to California when he was a child and he first lifted what he recalls as a " deep , woolly but unmanageable " voice in the Hollywood High School Glee Club . He graduated to the Los Angeles City College opera and the chorus at Hollywood Bowl . To help earn his keep , he dubbed his voice into movie sound tracks , sang in nightclubs and in Los Angeles synagogues and churches . In 1943 , he got his first big break with San Francisco 's crack opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. , he decided to try his luck in Europe , " to avoid the inevitable fate of young American singers who wait hat in hand at the Metropolitan . " <P> Back to Boris ? Paid off by luck , big George was picking his way carefully . He was not quite ready for a Manhattan debut recital , he thought . But he had signed to sing in Mahler 's Symphony No. 8 with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony in April and in Beethoven 's Ninth with the Philadelphia Orchestra in May . Almost closed was a deal to sing in The Marriage of Figaro at the Edinburgh Festival this summer . <P> After that , he thought , he would like to go back to Vienna and sing some more Boris .
