When 67-year-old Artur Rubinstein swept his coattails back and sat elegantly down at his Steinway one night last week , many in the crowd in Manhattan 's Carnegie Hall felt they were about to listen to the best living pianist . All of them knew that they were to witness a notable musical event : the last of the great romantic performers in the spectacular tradition of Liszt and Anton Rubinstein* had set himself a schedule of no less than 17 major works in a series of five concerts in 13 days-all the concertos of Beethoven and Brahms , plus ten works by Mozart , Rachmaninoff , Tchaikovsky , Grieg , Liszt , Chopin , Falla , Franck and Schumann . <P> It was a characteristically Rubinsteinian feat-part grandstand play , part musical passion . " Anyone could do it , " he says with grand self-depreciation , " but no one will imitate me because I wo n't make a penny on it . " Out of his share of the receipts Rubinstein was paying for the accompanying symphony orchestra ( mostly members of the New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backbreaking concert schedule , tireless Artur Rubinstein took on two recording sessions , one of them at midnight ( he has sold more than 3,000,000 albums for RCA Victor ) . <P> It was almost 50 years ago to the month that Artur Rubinstein first played in Carnegie Hall ( a mere coincidence , he insists- " I hate anniversaries " ) . In that half century he has grown from a prodigy to a musical playboy to a great artist with the broadest popular following of any front-rank musician in the world . The compact dignity of his entrances , his ramrod back and frizzled grey crown , his highhanded hammering of the keyboard are known and loved wherever there are pianos . <P> Student of High Life . Rubinstein was born in Lodz , Poland , the youngest of seven children of a small manufacturer . By the time he was three , he was a " terrible little fiend " about music , screaming at his sisters when they struck a sour chord and banging the piano lid on their fingers to make them stop . Impressed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child-sized violin . Artur promptly smashed it . Papa bought another , and Artur smashed that too . Papa gave up , let him concentrate on the then less fashionable piano . <P> Rubinstein made his official debut in Berlin at the age of eleven , playing Mozart 's A-Major Concerto ( K. 488 ) . Critics cheered , but today he rarely plays Mozart . " He is the greatest of them all-so clear , so pure . Today I am too clever , too knowing , no longer simple . " <P> Instead of regular school , Artur had three tutors-one for French , one for English , and one for everything else . At 15 he was a veteran performer in the capitals of middle Europe and went to visit Paderewski , who relaxed the prodigy 's initial tenseness by feeding him champagne . The treatment worked so well that a visiting music critic from Boston arranged for his first tour in the U.S. On the boat going over , the charming teen-ager-of-the-world lost all his cash learning poker , but he made a big hit with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way around the big houses on Fifth Avenue .
