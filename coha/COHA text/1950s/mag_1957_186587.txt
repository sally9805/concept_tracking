To mayors of cities along France 's Mediterranean coast last week , the U.S. consulate in Nice dispatched an urgent predawn request : call out the police and round up all the U.S. Navymen in town . In half a dozen French and Italian ports , U.S. shore patrols marched into bars , hotels and nightclubs in search of men and officers of the U.S. Sixth Fleet . <P> By late afternoon the Sixth Fleet had sailed : from Cannes the 60,000-ton supercarrier Forrestal , from Naples the 45,000-ton battleship Wisconsin , from Leghorn the carrier Lake Champlain , from Villefranche and Marseille the heavy cruisers Salem and Des Moines . With them steamed a swarm of destroyers , transports , tankers . Under leathery Fleet Commander Charles Randall ( " Cat " ) Brown , the atomic-armed Sixth was eastward bound to back up and buck up little Jordan 's 21-year-old King Hussein ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . <P> " Independence &; Integrity . " In struggling against proCommunists and pro-Egyptians inside Jordan , Hussein was fighting not for the U.S. but for his own country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two blows for the West : against the prestige of international Communism and the prestige of the Arab world 's voluble troublemaker , Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt , who was trying from afar to bring Hussein down . The danger also threatened that Nasser 's ally Syria might invade Jordan-possibly toppling Hussein , possibly touching off an explosion that would drag the U.S. into hot war . It was clearly to the interest of the U.S. and of world order to deter Syria-or Egypt or Russia or Israel-from intervening against Hussein . <P> In Washington the day before the Sixth Fleet sailed , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conferred by telephone with the President . Then Press Secretary James Hagerty announced that " both the President and the Secretary of State regard the independence of Jordan as vital . " The wording , Hagerty noted , echoed the Eisenhower Doctrine 's declaration that the U.S. " regards as vital to the national interest and world peace the preservation of the independence and integrity of the nations of the Middle East . " <P> <P> " Sail When Ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send the Sixth Fleet hurrying eastward from its peaceful anchorages in the Western Mediterranean . Admiral Arleigh ( " 31-Knot " ) Burke , Chief of Naval Operations , issued the curt order : " Sail when ready . " The Sixth Fleet sailed under the straight-faced explanation that it was merely returning to its normal theater of operations . <P> The fleet 's hurried move brought on a flurry of arguments about whether the Administration was or was not acting under the newborn Eisenhower Doctrine , which authorized the President to use military force to aid Middle East countries appealing for help against aggressors " controlled by international Communism . " But Jordan had not been attacked , and Hussein had not asked for help ( although he had clearly declared that his troubles were being compounded by international Communism ) . The mission of the Sixth Fleet , which started patrolling the Mediterranean ten years before the Eisenhower Doctrine was born , was not to apply the doctrine , but to deter an outbreak of gunplay that might make it necessary for the U.S. to apply the doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
