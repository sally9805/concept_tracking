txt " Ike , " who frequently describes himself as an " old campaigner , " is becoming very much at home campaigning . He employs none of the arts of oratory and most of the arts of plain speech , infectious friendliness , and a sincerity which seems to rise above the copybook maxims and platitudes which would sound hollow from most anyone else . He speaks to youth as father to son ; he speaks to women as to men ; he speaks to voters as if they were his next-door neighbors . He swings out to the rear platform of his train with bounce and gusto . He is up late at night , and is speaking to a new trainside crowd at 7:45 in the morning . Nothing appears to tire the general , not even an average of seven to eight speeches a day . And the general certainly is not tiring his audiences . Lately he has been throwing away prepared manuscripts with both hands , and feels like a free man when he has done it . He rather proudly confides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop that his " political advisers inside are scared to death because they have n't the slightest idea what I am going to do or say . " But " Ike " seems to know what he is doing , and his aides are beginning to relax when he suddenly starts out on a line they never have discussed and ends up in a way they never have planned . He may be short , as he admits , on bright sayings , but he is not short of words or of homely , striking ways of expressing himself . General Eisenhower makes no effort whatsoever to minimize his military background despite the efforts of some of his opponents to argue that aretired soldier should n't be in the White House . He often talks of his experiences as a soldier , constantly refers to himself as " an old soldier " and always pays his respects to his " comrades in arms " who may be in his audiences . Military terms punctuate his speech . He mentions the " echelons of government " : his supporters often become " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a farm he was invited to drive a tractor , he said : " I do n't know how to handle this tractor unless it drives like a tank . Then I would be all right . " Plainly he likes people . He does n't talk " at " them or " over " them . He never gets over being surprised that so many come out to see him , and he obviously means it when he remarks that they are honoring him . not he them . He greets them as " folks " or as " my very dear friends . " and nobody feels he is saying it perfunctorily . One listener said to me : " He 's a good , plain-spoken man . " I heard another say to his wife : " You know , that fellow really sounds sincere . like he means what he says . " " Ike " is beginning to use some " props . " He holds up a dollar bill and then another piece of paper about half its size . " That , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only looks like a dollar bill but it will buy only half as much as a few years ago . " Again he will show his audience a nice one-foot piece of white pine . " In 1945 , " he says , " that piece of pine cost 15 cents . " He snaps it in two , holds a half piece aloft . " That , " he says , " is the amount of pine 15 cents will buy today . That is inflation . " * The general almost always says he is coming before his audiences " as a politician . " He agrees it is an unfamiliar role and often jests about it . He says it has its " ridiculoussides . " He told this story at Louisville : " The other evening I was at a television studio , I was one of the performers , and a man came around and said : ' I must put some powder on the top of your head so it does n't shine on the television screen . ' Then he began to laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your 101st Airborne Division . I was a paratrooper who dropped ? . . ' And then he named all the battles in which the 101st fought , a magnificent division . He said to me : Have n't you and I come to a pretty pass , you a politician and me a make-up artist ? ' " So . " the general added . " this new chore of mine does have its occasional light moments . " Often " Ike " addresses himself particularly to young people . He relates the dire uncertainty which preceded the Normandy landing and how he was never . so worried in his life in anticipation that his paratroopers would meet total suicide when they dropped . He mingled among the men of the 101st , and they said to him , " General , quit worrying . We 're on the job ! " " Ike " says that in the military textbooks he studied the general was supposed to go down to inspire the troops . " From that time on , " he concludes , " I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to young ones to get inspiration . You have it ; I get it from you . Never let anyone tell you that you young Americans can be defeated . " The one pledge he nearly always repeats is that if he has the responsibility to be President , every decision he makes will be measured by " what is good for the United States of America , not just one section or one group , but what is good for 155 million Americans . " And then he introduces " My Mamie. "
