A back door to wage increases , without regard to present ceilings , was thrown open last week by a panel of the Wage Stabilization Board . Last February the board ruled that increases in pension and welfare benefits be restricted along with ordinary wage increases . But Economic Stabilizer Eric Johnston hastily asked the board to think again . In a majority report , the board 's experts did so . They recommended that , with certain minor exceptions , no restrictions be set on new pension plans up to the " limits of accepted industrial practice " ( e.g. , those of American Telephone &; Telegraph , General Motors , etc. ) , and that there be no restrictions at all on health and welfare plans . <P> If these recommendations are accepted , pension schemes will spread faster than ever-raising industry 's costs , and eventually prices . WSB released some up-to-date estimates on the number of workers affected . Nearly 10 million U.S. workers are now covered by private pension schemes , and their number is growing by 2,000,000 yearly . Employers ' contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion of this is currently going into the funds ' invested reserves serves , more than half of it through insurance companies ( and thence into the bond market ) , and the rest into trust funds with more liberal investment policies . By the end of this year , the pension funds ' invested reserves , in employers ' contributions alone , are likely to reach $10 billion . Employees ' contributions , plus health and welfare reserves , will boost the total much higher .
