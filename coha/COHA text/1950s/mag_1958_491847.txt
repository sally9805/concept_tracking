1 CALL ON ED SULLIVAN By PETE MARTIN Sullivan , his daughter Betty ( left ) , and his wife Sylvia in Ed 's Park Avenue aparunem . I 've never learned to smile while I 'm talking , " he says , " That 's a show-business trick . The truth is I simile a lot , but 1 usually do it when one of my acts is through performing . " o writer has ever done a story about rn , that has n't made me sound too belligerent and pugnacious , " Ed Sullivan told me . " I 'm fifty , live . I have three grandchildren . I 've reached the point where I wince when I 'm always plc. wed as a brawler . In anything you write about me , I wish you 'd make it clear that that is not a complete picture of me . " " Those things arc part of the Sullivan record too , " I said . " All I know is I 'm fed up with wrangling , " he told me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shaped and decide that I must enjoy getting into lights . I 'm not copping any plc , when I tell you that 's wrong , because in each fight I 'd be willing to tell you exactly what happened . In the case of Winchell , once he started something , I was eager to tangle with him because I 've never liked the guy very much , but with the others I was an unwilling participant , not an eager volunteer combatant . " I 'm fed up with feuds and rumors of feuds , " he told me . No matter what you may have been told , I 've never started one . My feud with Godfrey was not of my making . Godfrey fired Julius La Rosa . I engaged La Rosa because hr immediately became a Page One character . In addition , he was a singer I could use to advantage on my show , That was about all there was to that . " My so-called Allen feud came strictly out of left field , so far as I was concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began with the theory that I planned a competitive tribute to jaine , Dean on my show to steal the thunder from Allen 's tribute to Dean . That theory was phony baloney . My exchange of unpleasantries with Sinatra was based on a similarly erroneoui conclusion . " 89 " I 've got a theory , too , " I said . " What is it ? " he asked . " My theory is that since your show is among the top-rating TV shows , " I said , " you 've got your head up above the fence and the fellow with his head above the fence is the fellow people heave rocks at . " " That could be , " he said . " since none of those things happened while we were taking a beating from N.B.C . in the ratings wars . In the beginning a lot of people knocked us off . Martin and Lewis beat us every time they went up against us . In thready days N B.0 threw people at us by the handfuls . Jimmy Durante , Berle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . But since I was the underdog , there were n't any feuds . " On second consideration , " he added thoughtfully , " I do n't necessarily agree with you that it was only after I neared the top in the ratings that lists were shaken in my smiling face . I 'd say the warfare began mainly because a new group with a more intense competitive instinct came into television . " Fights and feuds and name calling grab the headlines . " Sullivan went on , " People like to read about them , but in ten years on TV , I 've found one basic truth : The things that stay in the minds of people across the country after a show is over are things that involve sentiment . Not phony sentiment  --  not something deliberately set up as a weeper . Several shows  --  I do n't have to tell you which ones  --  go in for that . People spot that kind of thing quickly when it 's a fraud . Now I 'll give you a genuine example of what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biog of Josh Logan , the famous Broadway and Hollywood director , on our show . I 'd been talking to Josh , who 's a very sensitive and tremendously emotional guy , about a time when he hail been committed to a mental hospital . " " I remember , " I said . " He had a nervous breakdown . " " Actually it was a mental breakdown , " Sullivan told me . " Josh said , ' Ed , the mental-health program in this country is so important that I 'd like to talk about what happened to me , It may help somebody . ' ' " Fine ; I said , but afterward some of our production people talked me out of doing it . The night of the show Logan was standing backstage with Leland Hayward , watching me put on a parade of his triumphs . He came up to me , tense and taut , and said . ' Ed , this thing is turning into one of those boring slap-yourself-onthe-hack routines , It 's flattering , but it 's of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turned out well , but we should have worked in the thing we discussed  --  I mean what happened to me mentally . ' - " ' If you want to do it that much . ' I said , ' we 'll do it . ' I cut short a number ; I was able to close in the curtains with a flourish of music , and Josh stepped out on stage . ' Ladies and gentlemen , ' I said , ' Joshua Logan . ' " ' This , ' he said to the audience and the viewers , ' has been gratifying to my ego , but it 's not important . As it happens , I do have one important thing to tell the country , and I 'll tell it quickly . 1 never got any of the awards I 've won until I 'd been committed to a mental hospital and released from it . ' " fl almost asked Sullivan what Josh Logan had received an award for . Then I remembered one of them . With Rodgers and Hammerstein , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner of the Pulitzer Prize for the beat drama of 1950.1 Sullivan went on quoting Logan . " Josh said , ' I tell you this because the world is suffering from tensions , with the result that many people are crippled by mental breakdowns . The old way of treating them was to hide them in the garden house when people came to visit in warm weather or lock them up in the attic in winter . You do n't have to do either any more . A lot of people who are disturbed mentally can be cured , just as typhoid , scarlet fever and tuberculosis can be cured . There is no reason why they should go through life bearing a stigma because they have once been mental patients . This is what I wanted to tell you tonight , ' " People who were watching Logan 's face on their screen at home could see that this was no phony plant , no heart squeeze staged for its theatrical effect . I ! ere was a man big enough to tell the people a thing many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alter Logan was through , there was a moment of complete silence ; then there was a shattering roar of applause . " I could understand that . I could also understand Logan saying what he 'd said . It was in character . 1 had once helped Ethel Merman write the story of her life and Logan was one of those I had turned to for help in obtaining background material about her . He was in the middle of directing a show . He was up to his eyeballs in out-of-town tryout. ; he was even helping rewrite the production when his secretary relayed my request to him . As busy as he was  --  and he must have been more than a little harassed  --  he had taken the time to write mc a many-paged letter about La Merman . " What Josh said was picked up almost immediately all over the country , " Sullivan continued . " Two weeks later I got a letter from lodge Michael A. Musman no , of the Pcnnsyk ania Supreme Court , In it he said : thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days ago . The ease involved a young mother and a father who had three children . He lost his job , which created tension in the home . About the same time that domestic tensions developed , the wife 's father was killed in an accident . As a result , the wife suffered a menial breakdown . She was committed to a hospital . By the time she got out , the marriage had broken up and the young husband had turned the three children over to his mother , who was bringing them up . " ' When the wifewas pronounced cured , she applied for custody of her children . The Pennsylvania law held that her commitment to such an institution had invalidated her capacity and rights as a mother forever . Neighbors who thought this wrong raised money to bring her cause up for appeal . It has gone all the way to the state Supreme Court . The court has repudiated the old concepts of " forever " penalties resulting from being committed . It not only rejected such concepts , it declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to her children . The opinion went on to say that it had found support in a nationally televised show , on which Joshua Logan had said that he had n't won the Pulitzer Prize until he had been committed to an institution and had then been pronounced cured . ' " And that 's not all , " Sullivan told me . " Not long after that I went to Oklahoma City to address an advertising-club luncheon . I told this story there . Right after luncheon a doctor came up and introduced himself , He told me he was head of the mental-health program in the Southwest . lie said , ' I could have told you of some local repercussions to your Logan show . For years I 've tried to raise money for this cause  --  to get new drugs developed and used , and to persuade young doctors skilled in research to work on the problem away from the ball-andchain traditions of the past . The day following your Logan telecast the budget director of my state called me and told mc that I Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logan had said on your show . ' " What I 'm getting at , " Sullivan went on , " was that here was something that aroused sentiment . Once aroused , that sentiment sus a lever which performed a public service . " " It seems to me I remember vaguely a story about you and Ben Hogan that shows that Hogan has a lot of heart , " told Sullivan , " and that he 's a right guy . How 's about telling mc about it in your own words ? " " Fie 's one of the classiest guys we 've ever had on our show , " Sullivan said . " Right after his recovery from his near-fatal auto accident , Hogan was in a triple tie in Philadelphia at the Merlon Club with George Fazio and Lloyd Mangrum for the United States Open title . I called him in Philadelphia and said , ' Ben , I 'll give you a thousand dollars , win , lose or draw , to appear on our show . I do n't care how you make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story was that he 'd corm back after almost dying , not whether he won the championship or not . ? I 'd better not promise to go on your show this Sunday , ' he said . ' I do n't know how long the play-off will take . It may not finish until late . I 'm dead tired anyhow . l 'll come over to New York soon for a tournament at New Rochelle ; I 'll be living in White Plains . If you want me then , I 'll be delighted . ' I said , ' Fine , it 's a date , ' " He won the play-off in Philadelphia , and a rcprescntatise of We the Peopk called mc and said , ' We understand that you 've got Hogan locked up for a thou . sand bucks . We can use him on our Wednesday show and we 're prepared to give him fifteen hundred dollars . ' At that time Hogan had n't made the money he was to make later , He had n't even gotten a settlement out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ' if he can make an extra five hundred , that 's fine with me . ' An hour later Hogan himself called . He said , ' I understand some people have been in touch with you and that they 've told you that they 've offered mc fifteen hundred dollars and you told them it was O.K. with you . ' " ' That 's right , ' I said . ' An extra five hundred is nothing to sneeze at . ' " ' Look , ' he said , ' they had no authority to call you . Your offer was a thousand dollars , win , lose or draw . That offer meant more to me than any of the offers I 've got since I won . If you still want me for a grand , I 'm not appearing on any other show . ' " ' I 'll be delighted to have you , ' I said . " " I like that story , " I said . " it gives me a warm feeling , " AT vain until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we did Helen Hayes ' biog on our show , her daughter . Mary MacArthur , had just died , but Helen had decided that work would be her salvation , so she did a scene on our show from her play , Victoria Regina . She chose the scene where the queen and her family came hack to the royal residence after a day 's outing , and some member of the family asked her if she did n't think that , on the whole , the day had been too much for her . The queen replied that she had only felt the strain once . At one point the police lines had been drawn thin . A group of roughly dressed workingmen had broken through . They 'd come rushing up to her unprotected carriage until they were about ten feet away , and she had feared they might be anarchists . Then they 'd stopped and the toughest-tooking one of all had called out to her . ' Go it , old girl ; you 've done well . ' " ' The reason I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that there 's a line in it which rings a belt in my heart . Someday I 'll be making my last appearance . I 've February Ia. 195H lived a singularly blessed life . I 've done the things I 've loved best with people I 've loved most , the people of the theater . Perhaps before I make my last exit from the stage , you of the American nudience who have been so kind to me may feel impelled to call out , " Go it , old girl : you 've done well . " ' " There followed one of those hushes which mean so much more than hand-clapping . Everybody was conscious of the fact that she 'd just lost her daughter . Tears ran down the faces of some of the women in the audience . I 'd list that moment with my biggest in the theater . " I had n't seen Helen Hayes on that Sullivan show . I was glad I had n't . Her voice has always been able to wring me out emotionally , and after her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the throat just to watch her  --  even when she was n't saying anything . " That reminds me of something else , " Sullivan added . " During the last war , I organized art entertainment program for the hospitals along the East Coast . The wounded of the world 's crack divisions came through Halloran , the big general hospital on Staten Island . Father Bellamy , the Halloran chaplain , used to call me and say , ' Ed , the kids have read that Soand-So is in town . Do you think you can get him to come out ? ' Durante was coming to town for a broadcast , so I called him and said , ' I know how tough your schedule is . Jimmy , but these guys asked for you and l feel duty-bound to pass along their request . ' " ' Ed , ' he said , ' I do n't feel young any more and I 've got a bad cold . Also , I have a broadcast to do for a cigarette company . but call me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make it . ' I called him , and , to my amazement , he said , he there . ' " He had to work out a precise schedule to make it . He went down to the South Ferry , took a boat , crossed over to Staten Island , drove to the hospital ; then he planned to catch a ferry back in time for his broadcast . When Jimmy arrived at the hospital , I hid him and kept him hidden . I was so aware of the fact that I had to get him off the stage in time to catch the ferry back that I said , ' Jimmy , do just one number . They 'll be delighted . It 'll be a shot in the arm for them and I 'll explain to them why you ca n't stay longer . ' " I was calling on Sullivan in his apartment in the Hotel Delmonico. on New York 's Park Avenue . A maid bustled into a hallway just off the living room , where we were talking , and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hallway and asked her patiently and quietly if she would mind waiting until we were through with our conversation before going on with her job . Then he came hack and sat down on the divan . " The Gripsholm had brought hack another group of war wounded , " he told mc , " and the wounded who were already at Halloran had , with a gracious gesture , surrendered the divans in front of the recreation hull to the newcomers . I said , ' Fellows , there 's a young comic hare I 'd like to have you meet . ' Jimmy came on and the place went wild . He went into his routine with a piano , where he throws the sheet music around like snowflakes and rips the top of the instrument . He murdered them . " As he left the stage I walked to the mike and said , ' Jimmy has to get hack to town for a radio date ; I know you 'll understand . ' As I said that , he came hurrying out of the wings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The same thing happened a third time before he finally left the stage . Thanks to Durante , this was the greatest night the hospital had ever had . The place was pandemonium . I introduced the next act , and walked over to where Jimmy was sitting in the wings with his shirt off , rubbing the perspiration from his skinny body with a big towel . ' Are you out of your mind ' ? ' I asked him . ' You 'll never make your ferry . ' " ' Look at the front row , ' he said . ' Just look at it . ' I looked . There , on the same divan , were two kids , each with one arm missing . They were applauding the next act by beating their two remaining hands together . " ' When i saw that , Ed , ' Jimmy said , ' I made up my mind that my radio broadcast was n't so important and my cold was n't so important either . ' Jimmy is a very emotional guy . His eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me pretty emotional too , " I said . " Most writers generally ask me questions about my feuds and I get so involved in answering them 1 never have a chance to tell them anything else , " he said . " But to me , those arc the great things with which I 've been associated . not the brawls and the name calling . To them I 'd like to add the two reeord-breaking star shows I was privileged to put on in New York . Those shows raised 5500,000 in cash , not war bonds . One was for the American Red Cross . the other was for the Army Emergency Relief fund . " The point of it all is , it 's always the things that touch the panic button of people 's emotions that they remember . Maybe it 's a song they associate with their courtship . Maybe it 's Helen Hayes ad-libbing an unforgettable line . Maybe it 's Durante 's reason for skipping his broadcast . I can go to Europe and dig up all the top acts there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant , the show will he polished and no one will remember it very long . But if one thing with heart happens on our stage , that 's television at its greatest . " That 's why I hate to get sidetracked into talking about the feuds that have been forced upon me , although such discussions bring in carloads of publicity . " He paused a moment , then went on : " Take the night we did the Oscar Hammerstein biog on our show . To mc , Oscar has a Lineolnesque quality . He 's so decent that it shines out through his craggy face . That night I said that he had had an unusual career . He 'd had seven years of continuous success collaborating with Otto Harbach and Jerome Kern . Then he and Kern had been signed by Hollywood to write movie musicals , but by the time they got there the movie-musical boom was over and done with . Theater owners even had billboards out front proclaiming , ' No Hollywood musical on this program . ' The story of the understudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been done so many times the public was sick at its stomach . So when Hammerstein and Kern arrived in Hollywood , they got SI 50,000 for doing a show which was never produced . Beginning then , Hammerstein went into one of the most ferocious declines in the history of show business . There were eleven years in which he could n't seem to write a hit.1 asked him , ' Oscar , is it true that Broadway is brutal to people who fail ? ' " ' That 's a lot of rot , ' he said . ' They say hello to you just the same , even if they do n't buy your material . ' " ' How did a fellow like you , who 'd already had tremendous success , take eleven years of bitter and galling defeat ? ' asked . " I 'm married to a wonderful woman , ' he said ; ' when the lean times are on you . if you have n't got that you have n't got anything . She always felt I was a success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful , no matter what had happened during the day . ' " He went on to say that the lowest point of his life had been when France fell to the Nazis . Everything had crumbled under him . He had proposed that Green Grow the Lilacs be made into a musical , and although the idea was later to become a musical called Oklahoma ! , it was turned down then . He had proposed Carmen Jones to Jerome Kern . ' Jerry . ' he 'd said , ' Carmen would make a great musical treated in Harlem style . Instead of a bull-lighter , we can have a prize fighter . ' But Kern was tied up and could n't do it . It was at that moment that Paris surrendered . Oscar had lived in Paris and loved it , and another part of his world had fallen . As far as anyone could see , there was never going to be a French Paris again . " I had forgotten that Hammerstein had written a song called The Last Time I Saw Paris . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Against the background of what Sullivan had told me , those words took on added poignancy . " It was an emotional straw that could have broken his back , " Sullivan said " instead it compelled him to write a song . He told our audience , ' I do n't sing , ! ca n't dance , I ca n't tell jokes , but if you like . I 'll tell you the lyrics 1 wrote that day about the wonders of Paris . There is no Folio-HcWre in my lyrics . I wrote about daytime in Paris , the nurses in the park , the children playing , the chestnut blossoms glossing in the springtime tin : He recited the lyric , and our on:hest ra leader , Ray Block , cued his band into underplaying the melody of The Last Time I Saw Pans under Oscar 's vsords . Youcou Id have lit ird a mouse stumble in that theater . " We sat silent for a whsle ; then I said , " Listening to you talk about Hogan . I got the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically . I still am , " he said . " And my show shows it . Throughout the years I 've had the greats in sports on my show . On those occasions I 've felt cry much at home . I was a pretty good sports writer . 1 wo n't say that about my Broadway column . I never wanted to be a Broadway columnist , and in my first Broadway column I said so . I said that I was n't interested in retailing the kind of garbage they had to rake up . " Suitt% an 's right-hand man , Carmine Santulo , came into the living room in Sullivan 's Park Avenue apartment . He earned a glass of milk . Sullivan waved him assay . " You and I have something in common , " I said . " I once had a duodenal ulcer , but they removed it surgically and all I have left to show for it is a big Caesarean scar . " " My doctor puts that off as long as he can and only uses it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes to try medication and diet . " " What 's your system for living with your ulcer ? " I asked . " As long as I stay away from fried foods I 'm O.K. , " he said . " My doctor also told me to give up smoking , but 1 made a brave stand for my favorite vice . I told him . ' I do n't drink . 1 do n't play around a lot , I do n't gamble . Smoking is my one outlet , 1 think it actually helps curb my tension . Whether that 's scientifically true or not , that 's my story , ' " " I used to be a two-pack-a-day man , " 1 told him . " Then one day I quit . " " I gave it up for three years , " he said ; " but I went back to it . " " How did you happen to start again ? " asked . " I was trying to give Mrs. Sullivan a moral lecture , " he told me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been off cigarettes for three years , I said , ' I do n't understand why you ca n't break yourself of the habit . I did . I can pick up a cigarette and put it into my mouth and light it and have no oserwheIming desire to smoke . ' And I demonstrated my self-control by doing just that . I went through my ' how to cope with temptation ' routine twice more for her , The third time I started smoking again . " Illaybe you 'd better give me some personal background on you , " I said to Sullivan . " My visit with you is not going to result in the story of your life , even a capsule variety of it . But one or two odds and ends of autobiographical material might be dropped in right about here . " " I 'll rattle off some things , " Sullivan said , " you can use whatever you want . I was born in Harlem in New York City . My father was Peter A. Sullivan . My mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Kirk Douglas comes from there too . My cousin , Jim McNulty. was once the mayor of Saratoga Springs . My twin brother , Dan , is buried at St. Mary 's churchyard in Amsterdam . He died when he was about a year old . " " Were you identical twins ? " I asked . He grinned . " I doubt it .. " he said . " I 've been told he was a handsome little fellow . My kid sister , Elizabeth , is buried there too . My sister , Helen , is the eldest . Then there 's Charles , myself , my sister Mer cedes , and my sister Frances . My father settled in Harlem because a Democratic congressman got him an appointment as a New York customs inspector . " " I 've heard you taught yourself to type by copying New York Times editorials , " said . He told me , " When I went to work on the New York Evening Mail , after writing sports for the Port Chester Daily Item , I 'd never learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lwel  --  c columns of sports for the hem . but I 'd done it all longhand . When I got a job in Hartford and next in New York , I was still writing in longhand . But when my copy went to the composing room the guys down there had trouble reading it ; they complained bitterly , so I had to learn to use the typewriter . I went into the newspaper 's library , sat there and copied Times editorials until 1 learned . " " How many fingers did you use ? " I asked . " Three ? " " Two , " he said . " What 's all this about you being a man whose face would crack if it smiled7 I asked . " 1 notice that you 've smiled a lot as I 've talked to you . The way I get it , you 're called Smiley in derision because you 're supposed to be so expressionless . " " I 've never learned to smile white I 'm talking , " he said . " That 's a show-business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile while they 're singing . But the fact that I 've stayed in the entertainment business without mastering that stunt has become a sort of trade-mark for mc . Since no one could pin some label on me like Joe Penner 's ' Do you wan na buy a duck ? ' or Jack Pearl 's ' Vas you dare , Sharlic ? ' the legend that I never smile has become an easy way to identify me . The truth is I smile a hell of a lot , even on the show , but I usually do it when one of my acts is through performing and the audience is giving it a hand . " White we 're on the subject of my TV mannerisms , " Sullivan added , " I might as well go into the way I stand , walk and move my head . I have a very big neck for a man my size , It 's a Size Seventeen and it 's all out of proportion to the rest nitric . " " You do have an individual way of walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move at the same time , as if they are rigidly attached to each other . Did you do exercises to make your neck thicker when you were young ? " " No , " he told me . " I have a big neck because of the way the upper part of my body is built , and it 's that construction that makes me walk the wiry I do . You 're not the only person who 's noticed it , " he said . " I get a lot of mail about it . " " What kind of mail ? " I asked . " All sorts , " he said . " A lot of the fans feel that my walk is an expression of personal conceit . They say , ' It makes you look smug and stuck-up ? ' When I read that 1 started putting Will Jordan , the professional mimic , on my show to do imitations of me . I thought it would indicate to the viewers that I am so far removed from excessive egotism that I enjoy being joshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've watched you while he 's doing his imitations , " 1 said . " And you seem to gel a kick out of them . " " He exaggerates my mannerisms until he 's more like mc than I am myself , " Sullivan went on . " When he gets going he breaks me up . All those vocal impressionists go to the theaters on West Forty-second Street that run movies over and over again , on a grind basis . They sit there night after night , watching the same moving picture , until they can match a movie actor 's every tone and gesture . " " Where did Will Jordan study you ? " I asked . " He sat glued in front of his TV set every Sunday night until lie could mimic me , " Sullivan said . " People like Jordan have a special oral facility . When he does me. he changes his voice until it 's right on the button . I can close my eyes , stand off in the wings and tell myself 1 am hearing my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you walk and carry yourself the way you do because you have a silver plate in your head , " I told him . " I do n't know how that got started , but some people do think that , " he said . " One night I was at a party with my wife , and this man said to me , ' Mr. Sullivan , I want to congratulate you . ' ? On something t wrote in my column ? ' I asked . " ' No , ' he said . ' On your courage . ' " ' My courage ? ' I asked . " ' Yes , ' he said ' 1 think it 's just wonderful for a man with a silver plate in his head to steel himself to appear before audiences . ' Another story going around about me is that I broke my spine playing high-school football , and that I walk so stiffly because I had it fused . " Outside Sullivan 's apartment a storm raged . The blizzard hung grayish-white curtains of snow on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow and then said , " There 's something else I 'd wish we could talk about . The really top-drawer performers never think they 're so good that they do n't have to practice . Take Margot Fonteyn of the Sadler 's Wells Ballet , That ballet made its television debut on our show . I do n't know how many times Margot and Michael Somes , her dancing partner . had danced Swan Lake , but she had him out behind the wings up to the moment they went on , saying , ' Let 's try that pis ot just once more . ' Or take Ychudi Menuhin , After his final rehearsal for our show  --  the people were already streaming into the theater  --  Menuhin was still back there , practicing his fingering . It 's enlightening to compare such performers with the youngsters who 've made one record that 's been an overnight hit . They figure they know everything . " I PONT " Have you ever had any cleavage trouble on your shows ' ? " I asked . " Faye Emerson stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1949 , " he said . " Before that , she made ha TV start on our show modestly enough in a dramatic sketch , but later on she startled people with her generous display of the fact that she was a woman . That 's something you have to watch when you 're staging a TV show . When a girl star buys her gowns , the couturier who designs them for her is not thinking in terms of television , so he 's apt to build a costume that 's ton revealing . Such apparel is ac. cepted socially , but you ca n't wear it on television because that medium tends to exaggerate such matters . " " But a couple of girls tried it out on you , did n't they ? " 1 asked . " Oh , yes , " he said , " Jeanne Crain and Esther Williams . They are both very well fabricated and unashamed of it . I had the wardrobe mistress cover up the cleavage they were willing to display , with tulle , but when they came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What did you do then ? " I asked . " We were afraid something like that would happen . " he said , " so we 'd given orders that the minute it occurred the cameras would aim only at the head and neck . " Ibrought out a newspaper clipping , " This guy , " I said , " has written a story headlined : TOPPING SULLIVAN GREAT SHOCK TO MAVERICK STAR . What do you suppose he means by shock ? " " I read that one too , " Sullivan said . " What I think he means is this : mostly because of its sheer endurance , our show has become a legend . I imagine that when James Gamer , who stars in Maverick , was told that he was going to be on opposite us , he must have thought he was being tossed into a meat chopper , although he won a Purple Heart in Korea and he has plenty of guts . " On the other hand , when 1 heard that he was going on against me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally get . ling smart , I thought . They 're . sending something against me that 's completely different rather than a guy who does the same kind of things I do . Whorrer plotted that ' trove at ABC , is very wise " I knew that when my interview would go to press , Sullivan 's ratings would be slightly below the Maverick figures and that , in general . Allen was below Sullivan . I thought I 'd ask him anyhow . He held up our conversation while he telephoned to the nest room to ask Carmine Santulo for the latest rating comparison . Santulo brought in the latest three Trendex standings , jotted on a piece of paper . Sullivan read them off to me . " Maverick , twenty-two ; Sullivan , sixteen , " he said . " Maverick , nineteen ; Sullivan . eighteen . Maverick , twenty-one ; Sullivan , nineteen . " He did a little mental calculation ; then said , " Right now on the average we 're three points behind Maverick on the Trendex ratings . But those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings , which include many more cities , it 's a different story . For the two weeks ending December twenty-first , Gunsmoke was first , with 44.1 ; Perry Como was second , with 40.13 ; I was third , with 37,2 . " " Where were Allen and Maverick ? " asked . " Allen was sixth , with 36.2 , " he said ; " and Maverick , believe it or not , was thirty-second , with 30.1 . But , " he went on , " if you try to prove things with TV figures , you can become a mixed-up figure filbert . I try not to analyze things that way . If 1 do , become so obsessed with figures I 'll sometimes forget people . "
