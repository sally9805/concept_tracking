txt RIO- DE JANEIRO , July 2 ? The United States Secretary of State , Dean Acheson , landed at Rio de Janeiro at 10 o'clock tonight on an official visit to Brazil that has created general enthusiasm as an evidence of North American friendship for this country , which is proud of its record as a stanch ally of the United States . Mr. Acheson is due to remain in Rio de Janeiro until Monday , then to visit Sao Paulo one day before turning homeward . Arriving from Austria in the Presidential aircraft Independence , Mr. Acheson was greeted at the airport by the Brazilian Foreign Minister , Joas da Fontoura , Finance Minister Horacio Lafer and the Chief of the General Staff , Gen. Pedro Aurelio de Goes Monteiro . Speaking briefly before a Brazilian radio microphone , Mr. Acheson said his visit represented a rare chance for a civil servant to perform a duty that also was a pleasure and he hoped during his time here to perform a useful work in cementing the good relations already existing between the two countries . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of good feeling that drowned out // Communist efforts to stir up trouble and indicated the trip probably would be a diplomatic grand slam . There is a sound diplomatic reason for the visit . Brazilians are proud of their tradition of alliance with the United States . They are potentially , and probably in fact , the strongest nation of South America . They are the only nation of South America that sent an The Communist newspaper , Imprensa Popular , attempted today to incite the public to demonstrate against Mr. Acheson as an " imperialist tool " but it seems to have evoked little or no response . Elaborate security precautions had been taken but there was no indication they really were necessary . expeditionary force to Europe in World War II and they allowed the United States to use their air bases long before they actually were involved in the war . There has been much more bitterness in Brazil than most North Americans realize over the supposed " desertion " by the United States after the war ended . The line taken even by sensible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been : " You give many millions to your ex-enemies and little or nothing to the Brazilians who shed their blood in the same cause with you . " That idea appears even in friendly editorials published today in connection with Mr. Acheson 's visit , but because of the visit the tone has changed . Today it is mentioned as a fault that the United States is remedying . The liberal and independent Tribune Da Imprensa , reminded Brazilians tonight that the United States had not gone back on any promises but that at the Petropolis conference in 1,947 , President Truman and the then Secretary of State , Gen. George C. Marshall , had informed Brazil she could not hope for material help because Europe 's need was greater and that despite that , the Point Four program had been initiated with substantial help to Brazil . Behind that note of reason all emphasis here at present , as in the recent past , is on the hope of further financial aid from the United States and all thinking on the Acheson visit is tied up with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high diplomatic level and a matter of furthering goodwill and understanding . Brazilians still seem to feel there is a secret tie-up with some agreement to lend them large amounts for essential development . At a conservative estimate , the visit alone still is worth as much in goodwill as a $50,000,000 loan , because the Brazilians are aware I of Mr. Acheson 's responsibilities and of the enormous demands on his time . The visit itself is evidence , therefore , that the United , States has not been deliberately turning a cold shoulder to Brazil and the recent United States gesture in granting $57,500,000 in loans that had been hanging fire adds emphasis on that feeling . It was common knowledge that those loans , already approved by the Joint Brazil-United States Economic Commission , by the Brazilian Government and , in principle , by the Export-Import Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development , were being delayed through pressure from ' United States interests because of a dispute over the remit-1 tance home of profits earned here ' by United States capital . There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before hiss arrival , news of the visit has raised United States stock in Brazil more than any move that could have been made short of a visit by President Truman or the assumption of the entire burden of Brazil 's economic development .
