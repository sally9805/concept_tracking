In Assisi one day last June , Don Giovanni Rossi knelt in chapel before the Blessed Sacrament . Outside , a man pounded down the steep , cobbled street loudly singing a popular tune . Don Giovanni 's prayer faltered , and he thought ruefully : " If only that fellow were singing of Jesus , my mind would n't wander so . " <P> Promptly Don Giovanni drew up a list of popular songwriters and singers , sent them each a letter : " I enclose a copy of the Gospels for you . . . Please find in it somewhere an inspiration for a song . " * <P> Last week 14 brand-new recordings began spinning on Italy 's phonographs . Made by such top performers as the two Fasanos , a blonde-brunette sister team , and Singer Carla Boni and the Angelini Orchestra , the tunes were the kind that might be danced to in any cantina , whistled by any office boy . But the lyrics were different . Sang the Fasano sisters to a one-step that sounded something like The Donkey Serenade : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Saviour . <P> They keep clear of Jerusalem , where <P> Herod is raging . <P> Every creature sooner or later will serve , <P> As we are doing , the Infant Jesus . <P> <P> * Not a new idea in the U.S. , where " religiosos " are among the jukebox hits , e.g. , Give Us This Day , Somebody Up There Likes Me , I Believe .
