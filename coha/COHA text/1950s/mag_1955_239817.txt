The high-pressure campaigns for traffic safety tend to obscure a fact that the campaigns help to create : for 25 years , U.S. motoring has been getting safer year by year . Last year there were 36,300 traffic deaths , not far below 1941 's record 39,969 . But Americans are also driving more cars more miles . Deaths per 100 million car-miles have dwindled from 16 in 1930 to 11.4 in 1940 to 7.6 in 1950 . Last year they marked a new low : 6.5 . <P> Black Is for Death . Sidney J. Williams , 68 , the National Safety Council 's " dean of traffic experts , " says that the progress can be explained under three headings : the car , the road and the driver . " Generally speaking , " says he , " the car is safer than the road , and the road is safer than the driver . The car is easier to make safe because there is a new model every year . The highway is more of a permanent investment . But the driver is hardest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attitude . " <P> To get at him , a tough policy seems to work best . Last year Los Angeles courts punished as traffic offenders twice as big a proportion of motorists as they did in 1940 . Many of the offenders were sentenced to a course in a driver improvement school . Los Angeles has put teeth in the principle that " the pedestrian has the right of way . " In most of the U.S. , this slogan merely encourages the walker without inhibiting the driver ; in Los Angeles , motorists know that the courts will almost always hold the motorist at fault . <P> Detroit says over radio and TV , " Drunk Drivers Go to Jail . " It means just that ; last year 827 of them did , for a twelve-day average visit . The city 's drunk-driver accidents have dropped some 90% in twelve years . As part of its driver-education campaign , black flags flutter on Detroit 's police motorcycles on days when a Detroiter has died in traffic . <P> Traffic engineers have learned much about easing congestion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timed stop lights , but road building helps too . Freeways carry three times as much traffic as ordinary streets , with one-fifth the accident rate . When San Francisco recently opened a 1.3-mile portion of a new freeway , the accident rate on crosshatching streets for two miles on either side dropped 36% . <P> Sense Is for Horses . Says Los Angeles Safety Council President J. T. Blalock , " There are those who say that we 've got to figure on an irreducible minimum of accidents . I disagree . The irreducible minimum is zero . " Washington 's Safety Director Anthony Ellison counts on the citizen 's cooperation . Without it , he says , " You 've got nothing . " Los Angeles and Washington had fewest deaths per vehicle last year among cities in their population groups , with past leaders Detroit and San Francisco close runners-up . Last year 's booby prizes in the large city groups go to New York and Boston . Boston 's Chief Traffic Engineer Timothy J. O'Conner last week termed his tangle of jackknifed streets " a nightmare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's traffic is like the weather : nobody does anything about it . Cracked he : " We had just as many careless drivers 40 years ago as we do today . The only thing is , the horses had more sense . "
