The Sugar Bowl 's four-team basketball tournament last week was carefully planned for a logical climax : Kentucky v. Bradley , the No. 1 and 2 teams in the country . As first-round warmups for these giants , bowl officials invited Syracuse and St. Louis , good teams but not ranked among the nation 's top 20 . Syracuse followed the script to the letter and lost to Bradley . St. Louis refused to play dead . The Billikens had upset another great Kentucky team in the 1948 Sugar Bowl tournament , and they made up their minds to do it again . <P> St. Louis used the same old slowdown-and-possession tactics that had won for them two years ago . This did not entirely stop Kentucky 's great Bill Spivey ( who scored 16 points for the evening ) , but it did accomplish one of the big upsets of the young season , 43-42 . <P> With a glittering chance to knock off the nation 's No. 1 and 2 teams on consecutive nights , St. Louis threw away its slowdown stuff , switched to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three quarters . But Bradley stayed close to the pace , caught tired St. Louis , 52-52 , with seven minutes to play . Bradley wrapped up the game , the Sugar Bowl title , and top national ranking , 64-59.
