txt It is easy to say , as it has been said frequently of recent days in London , in Tel Aviv . and on Capitol Hill in Washington . that United States Secretary of State John Foster Dulles has no policy toward the ugly situation in the Middle East . that he is muddling while the Soviet Union builds up the armed might of the Arab states , that he and the President simply are ignoring a condition which could blow up at any moment into something quite as devastating as and perhaps even more damaging than the Korean war . It . is , of course . true that if real war , not just frontier harassment , should break out between Egypt and Israel , and the Western powers supplied Israel with arms while the Soviet Union supplied the Arab states , the resultant condition would be a serious one indeed . Those who criticize the alleged inaction of the government in Washington even suggest that Mr. Dulles is trying to avert what could be damaging to Part One of the administration 's election campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on looking the other way in a pious hope that the dangers will disappear if they are ignored long enough . * A A But to take this view of the affair is to overlook one of the most interesting possibilities of these postwar times  --  the possibility that Mr. Dulles is trying consciously to attack the Middle East problem at the very root of that problem in the boldest diplomatic experiment he has undertaken since he consented reluctantly to the meeting at the summit in Geneva last July . Consider what is the real cause of the Middle East crisis . It is not the existence of continued border friction between Israel and the Arab states . This is an old condition dating from British withdrawal from Palestine . It has been chronic and dangerous for years , but . never acute . It became acute when , tars ' power between Israel and the Arab states and to ration supplies of arms to the two sides to maintain that balance of military power . The maintenance of such a balance of power was the essence of the tripartite declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That policy worked so long as the three Western powers were the only suppliers of arms to the Middle East . It broke down the moment the Soviet Union entered the picture and . became an independent and uncoordinated supplier . There are , it seems to me. only two methods 12y v , rhig , fr the old system of a controlled balance can be restored .. One of these two methods would be for the three Western powers to declare that the area belongs to them , that no other country may send arms into it ; and then to en- force the policy by sealing off the area from the rest of the world . Is this really a possible policy ? Think of what it would mean . It would mean that the United States , Britain , and France would have to order the Soviet orbit countries to keep out of the area , and be prepared to enforce that order with their battleships , their air fleet 's , and their divisions of ground troops . A collateral result could well be that the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western powers . A A The other method of restoring the controlled balance of forces in the area would be to bring the Soviet Union into the machinery for controlling it . If that could be done . then all the great powers would assume collectively a neutral position in the issue , the balance would be controlled and restored , neither Israel nor the Arab states would dare to begin a war which could be choked off by merely stopping the flow of arms . This is indeed a bold idea . It is even a revolutionary one . No one in the West knows whether it is even theoretically possible because it depends on the readiness of Moscow to participate in a peacemaking rather than in a troublemaking operation . There is also the fact that to enter into such an agreement with Moscow would be to admit the Soviet Union to the Middle East as a power having valid and recognized interests there . But the West never will find out whether Moscow would be willing to participate in such a peacemaking operation , on acceptable terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulles ' dogged resistance to British and Israeli and congressional pressures , he is in fact engaged in the process of finding out whether Moscow would participate on an acceptable basis in restoration of a controlled balance of military power between Israel and the Arab states .
