MONTREAL CANADIENS This is one of the great teams of all time . Maurice Richard , at 37 , expects to get 25 goals . Former scoring champs Jean Beliveau and Boom Boom Geoffrion , healthy again , will make Dickie Moore ( right ) dig to repeat his 1957-58 title . Henri Richard , second in last season 's scoring , centers for The Rocket and Moore . Rookies Ralph Backstrom and Ab McDonald are competing for Bert Olmstead 's old left wing slot on a line with Beliveau and Geoffrion . The incomparable Doug Harvey leads the league 's best defense , reinforced by Rookie Albert ( Junior ) Langlois . Goalie Jacques Plante had the best goals-against average last year ; he 's back . // NEW YORK RANGERS A surprising second last season , New York is gambling now that five rookies will prove out . While they get acclimated , the team must rely heavily on veteran Right Wing Andy Bathgate ( right ) , a certified superstar ; Defense-man Bill Gadsby , one of the NHL 's best ; Left Wing Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Camille Henry , a 32-goal man . The brawling rookie wing , Eddie Shack , goes on a line with Red Sullivan and Andy Hebenton . Newcomers Jim Bartlett , Earl Ingarfield and Les Colwill are forwards ; another , John Hanna , plays defense . " We 'll get better , " says Coach Phil Watson , " as we go along . " // DETROIT RED WINGS Firmly dislodged by Montreal as the power of the NHL , Detroit is rebuilding . Six players are new to the team this season . One thing is constant , however-the stature of Gordie Howe ( right ) . Scoring champion five times and most valuable player four times , Howe , at 30 , is fit and looking for another 40-goal season . Center Alex Delvecchio moves to left wing on a potent line with Howe and Center Norm Ullman . Five new forwards are being tried out , including a lad named Charley Burns who suffered a terrible skull fracture five years ago . " We can finish anywhere from second to sixth , " says General Manager Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to six games in the Stanley Cup finals on aggressiveness , desire and the inspired goal-tending of Don Simmons . There are no superstars , but instead a high proportion of good , honest workmen like Defenseman Doug Mohns ( left ) . The first line of Don McKenney , Fleming Mackell and Jerry Toppazzini is intact , and Real Chevrefils , a 31-goal player in 1956-57 , takes over Johnny Bucyk 's wing on the line with Bronco Horvath and Vic Stasiuk . Center Earl Reibel was obtained from Detroit , Winger Guy Gendron from New York . Captain Fernie Flaman , Mohns , Leo Boivin and Bob Armstrong make up a stout defense corps . " We 'll be stronger , " says Coach Milt Schmidt . // CHICAGO BLACK HAWKS Chicago has not had a playoff team since 1952-53 and , in fact , has yet to win an NHL title . The great ex- Detroit left wing , Ted Lindsay , fizzled expensively last year . Now the Black Hawks have spent $100,000 more to acquire the veteran NHL defensemen Dollard St. Laurent , Al Arbour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as some minor leaguers . All-Star Goalie Glenn Hall ( left ) is bound to have a more effective defense in front of him ; Sloan and Lewicki help fill the chasm at center . Holdover Forwards Ed Litzen-berger , Eric Nesterenko and Bobby Hull must provide the scoring punch . " I think we 'll get one of the playoff spots , " says Coach Rudy Pilous. // TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS Toronto 's prospects for a solid recovery from last season 's horrible finish depend on some big ifs . If 32-year-old Bert Olmstead digs for the puck and makes plays as he did at Montreal ... if last year 's rookie sensation , Frank Mahovlich , clicks on the new line with Olmstead and George Armstrong ... if Johnny Bower , up from Cleveland , trades off effectively with Ed Chadwick in goal ... if the Leafs ' 1957-58 scoring leader , Dick Duff ( left ) keeps improving ... if the minor league stars Steve Kraftcheck and Carl Brewer make good on defense ... then the slump will be over . Right now it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy Reay insists , " I 'm sure we can finish third . "
