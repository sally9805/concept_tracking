Fiercely mustachioed General Nader Batmanghelich , chief of staff of the Iranian army , raised a pickax one day last week and brought it down hard on one of the highest domes in Teheran . This ceremonial blow dramatized the Iranian government 's outlawing of the Bahai religion in the land where it was born and began the conversion of Bahai national headquarters into a secular building . All over the world , from the lakeside gentility of Chicago to Israel 's port city of Haifa , Bahai voices rose in protest . <P> One Up on Christianity . To the Shiite Moslems of Iran , Bahaism is a heretical splinter group . The controversy centers around their belief in the second coming of the Imam , a descendent of Mohammed 's son-in-law AH , who will inaugurate a new and glorious era in history after a period of wars , eclipses and catastrophes . But the Bahais believe that the Imam already has come-heralded by one Mirza Ali Mohammed , who proclaimed himself Bab ( Gate ) and stirred up enough theological ruction to get himself executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mirza Hussein Ali , a wealthy cabinet minister 's son , who took the name Baha'u'llah , and in 1863 proclaimed himself " Him Whom God Shall Manifest , " calling upon his fellow sectarians in the Middle East to recognize him as their leader . Baha'u'llah 's son carried the new teaching to the West and the faith now has some 6,000 followers in the U.S. Center of U.S. Bahaism is Wilmette , Ill. , a suburb of Chicago where the strange tracery of the U.S. 's only Bahai temple drew more than 100,000 tourists last year . <P> Bahais think of their religion as an advance on all others because it encompasses them . They see all great religions and their founders as essentially one . They concentrate their own efforts not on individual salvation but on the achievement of universal peace . " We are one up on Christianity , " says white-haired Leroy loas ( pronounced Iowaas ) , a retired Chicago railroad manager , who serves as secretary general of the international council at Haifa . " Christ never mentioned universal peace in his teachings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and against treaty arrangements " based on force " ( NATO ) . The sect 's current head , Shoghi Effendi Rabbani , is in his fifties , lives in Haifa with his Canadian-born wife , and presides over a spiritual constituency of some 200,000 Bahais in Europe and Britain , about 1,500,000 in Iran . <P> Silent Surrender . Famed Bahais are said to have included Queen Marie of Rumania , Actress Carole Lombard , Philanthropist Edith Rockefeller McCormick and President Wilson 's daughter , Margaret , who , Bahais believe , gave her father twelve of his Fourteen Points straight from the writings of Baha'u'llah . U.S Bahais talk mysteriously of an anonymous fellow religionist high in the State Department , but it is possible that he himself does not know about it . " Anybody who believes in the universal faith is a Bahai , says Insurance Man Ellsworth Blackwell of the U.S. national assembly . " We consider some people Bahais who may neve have heard of it .
