txt The following developments took place yesterday in the prosecution of Communist leaders accused of criminal conspiracy to teach and advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence : 1 . A Federal judge set Aug. 20 as a tentative date for the trial of seventeen indicted leaders who were arrested June 20. 2 . A Federal grand jury began an investigation into possible obstruction of justice or harboring of eight fugitives from justice . 3 . A State Supreme Court hearing was ordered in an investigation of possible banking law violations by the organization calling itself the Civil Rights Congress , which in 1949 and 1951 put up $441,000 in bail for Communist leaders . 4 . A defense move was started to ask a justice of the United States Supreme Court to bail out three trustees of the Civil Rights Congress bail fund now held without bail for contempt of court . Judge John F. X. fixed the date for trial . In 1949 he , as United States Attorney , headed the prosecution of eleven top Communists convicted after a ninemonth trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // indictment aid affirmation of the conviction last June 4 by the United States Supreme Court . In the forthcoming case the defense has indicated it intends to seek  --  and the Government plans to oppose  --  similar delay . When the case of the seventeen was called before Judge yesterday morning , the eleven still in jail in default of acceptable bail appeared in court , but the six free on bail did not . Neither did eight attorneys assigned by the court as defense counsel . Judge adjourned the hearing until afternoon , when all appeared except two defendants and one lawyer . The absent defendants were 70-year-old Israel Amter and 69-year-old Jacob Mindel , both of whom have been represented as too ill to be able to escape . The absent lawyer was Leonard Boudin , whose partner , Victor Rabinowitz , explained that he could . not be reached in time . Assistant United States Attorney John M. Foley asked for the Aug. 20 trial date . He explained that the Government did not expect the trial to begin at that time , but wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preliminary matters . He pointed out that defense motions attacking the indictment were scheduled to be heard on or before Aug. 2 . The procedure he proposed , he added , would facilitate the final choice of an early trial date . Judge said he assumed that if all motions were disposed of by Aug. 20 , the Government would then ask for a final trial date to be fixed . Defense Opposes Date Set All defense counsel opposed the Aug. 20 date . Mr. Rabinowitz proposed November at the earliest , because of the great amount of work needed to prepare for the defense in view of the many ramifications of the case . Michael I. Begun suggested late fall . George Blake Charney , a defendant out on $10,000 bail posted by his father , urged the court to allow those in jail " reasonable opportunity " to consult with counsel they might like to retain in place of lawyers assigned by the court . " You are not precluded from getting other counsel , " Judge pointed out . Simon W. Gerson , a defendant still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stopping you , " Judge said . Gerson then began to argue with the judge , in a hectoring tone . " I do not propose to be interrogated or to make answers , " Judge replied sharply . Gerson then subsided . Several of defense counsel asked to be relieved of their assignments , but Judge referred this to Federal Judge Sylvester Ryan , who had made the assignments . Judge Ryan is on a short vacation , due to return July 30 . The grand jury investigation was begun by calling as witnesses the three trustees of the Civil Rights Congress bail fund who have been jailed for criminal con- tempt of court . They are Frederick Vanderbilt Field , millionaire " angel " of Communst causes ; Dashiell Hammett , mystery-story writer , and W. Alphaeus Hunton . Hammett and Hunton are serving six-month terms and Field a ninety-day sentence , all imposed by Judge Ryan . The three refused to produce the bail fund books , to answer questions about its members or operations , or help in the apprehension of four Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Attorney Irving H. Saypol haled the three before the grand jury for about five minutes each . ' They were then sent back to the Federal House of ' Detention . They have an opportunity to consult counsel before their expected return to the grand iury room tomorrow . Counsel Tells of Plans After the grand jury session . Mr. Rabinowitz , as counsel for the trustees , announced that he was preparing papers to submit to a Supreme Court justice in Washington , asking bail pending appeal in the contempt case . The Civil Rights Congress is designated by the Federal Attorney General as a Communist front . So is the Council on African Affairs , of which Hunton is secretary . Likewise , the American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born , of which Abner Green , another bail-fund trustee , is , secretary . Mr. Green obtained an order to show cause yesterday , returnable before Justice Henry Clay Greenberg this morning in the State Su-li Court , to prevent the State Banking Department from getting possession of the bail fund 's books and records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its investigation to determine whether the banking laws had been violated by the exercise of banking functions without obtaining a license from the department . Justice Greenberg said the hearing would be held to decide whether to issue a stay of execution pending decision on the motion to quash the subpoenas . Mr. Green 's petition alleged that the banking department was using its powers illegally to get the names of the lenders of money and securities to the bail fund . Last Monday Judge Ryan disqualified the Civil Rights Congress bail fund and its trustees from serving as bondsmen in the Federal court . On July 3 the bail fund forfeited $80,000 bail it had posted for the four bail-jumpers . These jumpers are Gus Hall , the Communist party 's national secretary ; Harry Winston , national organization secretary ; Robert Thompson , New York state chairman ; and Gilbert Green , Illinois chairman . Four others have been missing since June 20 , after having been indicted with the seventeen arrested on that date . These four are James E. Jackson , Sidney Stein or Steinberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all except Marron  --  are members or alternate members of the party 's national committee or ruling body . It is believed they have gone into hiding , here or abroad , to act as a secret Politburo to direct the party 's underground movement in this country .
