The Night Heaven Fell ( Raoul J. Levy ; Kingsley International ) . " Is it fun to make love ? " the foxy little doxy inquires as she hip-flips up to the camera and ( as the French say ) " makes the lip . " Since the girl is played by Brigitte Bardot , she obviously has no trouble getting all sorts of answers to her question . <P> The first answer is very French but not much fun . Brigitte 's uncle , a not-too-old goat of a Spanish nobleman , tries to horn in on her afternoon nap , and only the fortunate interruption of a passing prelate rescues the heroine ( and the audience ) from a fade worse than death . The second answer is very Spanish but rather grotesque . Since no suitable male is available , B.B. decides to make playful advances to a fighting bull . As she sidles up to him mooing small endearments , the poor bull just stands there looking cowed . The third answer is very Hollywood but sort of tedious . When a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brigitte helps him to escape . Night falls , and they hide out in an abandoned mill , a gypsy camp , a cave . On they go , one jump ahead of the police , until the censor has had just about all he can bare . <P> The story is not in itself a bad one , but as written it has a **28;6218;TOOLONG monotony . And the color sometimes looks as if it had been scribbled over a black-and-white negative with children 's crayons . In short , the film is carelessly put together-but Brigitte is not . <P> In Love and War ( 20th Century-Fox ) . In the midst of a battle sequence in this movie a wisecracking marine picks up a jangling field telephone . " Good morning , " he says cheerily . " This is World War II . " He could n't be more mistaken . This is World War II as it seems , 13 years after the bloody fact , to a corps of Hollywood professionals who have unquestionably seen more scenes of combat in movie houses than in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this picture , even though it is carefully filled out with official military footage , smells unmistakably of the klieg lamp , and the episodes on the home front , for all the respect they show to the times , might as well have taken place , not in the Roosevelt era but during the Nebuchadnezzar administration . <P> As for the plot-derived from a 1957 novel , The Big War , by Anton Myrer-it is the usual panoramic , cram-it-all-in , move-over-Tolstoy sort of thing , with a plural hero ( Robert Wagner , Jeffrey Hunter , Bradford Dillman ) who has any number of women ( Dana Wynter , Hope Lange , Sheree North , France Nuyen ) in his composite life . Nothing happens that has not happened a hundred times before in other war pictures-except perhaps an unusually large number of sincere but badly misdirected performances by promising young cinemactors . All of them , as Producer Jerry Wald proudly points out , have been carefully nurtured in the Fox talent school as a part of what Wald calls the studio 's " reforestation program .
