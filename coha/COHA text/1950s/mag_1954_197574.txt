Mohammed Reza Pahlevi , Shah of Persia , lit cigarette after cigarette with shaking hands as he stood on the tarmac of Teheran 's Mehrabad airport one evening last week . At ten-minute intervals , planes glided in to land . None of them brought the news the Shah was waiting to hear : word of his missing brother , 32-year-old Prince Ali Reza , heir to the Iranian throne . <P> Prince Ali had gone up north to hunt , and to look in on his plantations near the Soviet frontier , but planned to return to Teheran for the Shah 's 35th birthday celebration . When he arrived at the airstrip at Gurgan , the pilot of his single-engined Piper pointed to the snow-capped mountains wreathed in ominous clouds , but the prince was anxious to start home . Before he took off , Ali did an act of kindness : into his plane he loaded an old peasant ill with tuberculosis , who needed immediate hospitalization . Then the plane , carrying prince and peasant , headed for the capital two hours away . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party was called off , and 25 Iranian-piloted Thunderbolts , assisted by eight U.S. Air Force planes , began a methodical sweep over the desolate Turkoman steppe . On the fifth day of searching , three peasants saw vultures swooping over a hidden ravine in the Elburz Mountains , only 42 miles from Teheran . The peasants went to the spot and there found the bodies of the prince and his two companions . <P> Ali 's death leaves Iran without an heir presumptive . The Pahlevi dynasty began only with the Shah 's father , a onetime army sergeant who seized the throne . The Shah himself has no sons . His five half brothers are the sons of princesses of the old rival Kajar dynasty , and are constitutionally barred from royal succession . Parliament can , however , shut its eyes and grant Iranian " quality " to one of the half brothers , making him eligible for the throne .
