FAIRLY recently two novels have appeared that do not attack business . This is not to say that all other novels do , but rather that all the novels dealing with business that I have seen for many years attack it , and pretty sharply . " The Power and the Prize " by Howard Swiggett and " Executive Suite- by Cameron Hawley defend business and business men , the one subtly with a fair show of objectivity , the other anxiously ; in fact , Hawley 's publishers claim that he " shows business to be an essentially honorable and socially beneficial way to spend one 's life . " Judged seriously as works of art , these books are sentimental , naive , and technically commonplace . But as documents they are fascinating . If there are a few individuals who have avoided any dependence on business , they are hardened eccentrics , surviving in remote mountain valleys on brook trout and service berries . The rest of us are caught , and the authors of most business novels condemn the intricacy of our entanglement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ALLAN SEAGER , novelist , teaches at the University of Michigan . His latest book is " Amos Berry . " reluctantly , of vast political power . They have observed that the existing specialization in shop and office stifles the individual . They stubbornly revive the old chestnut about the ethics of business being low , a point expounded by every American novelist since Frank Norris and blindingly obvious to anyone who buys and ingests a loaf of our contemporary rubber bread . They even contend that much of our business activity is gratuitous , and prove it by asserting that while the aim of production and distribution is to supply the populace with food , clothing , and shelter , about half of us get paid for catering not to these needs but to trivial desires originated and cultivated by the advertising business . Who , they ask , demanded the automobile or radio ? Anyone ? No , they were supplied and now seem necessities . Probably most of these complainers drive cars and listen to phonograph records , though if consistency has any value they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that many will take these backward steps , and the revolution that will upset our business society has not made the faintest preliminary stir . Probably for the next half-century we shall have rebels , not revolutionaries , and their piping accusations will seem mere private crochets , almost powerless . Yet the interesting thing about these accusations is that they arc often true . Tiny as they are , the arrows have stung the behemoth , though there has been no official response or denial in the speeches of N. A. M. presidents or in business magazines . It is really not odd that the principal spokesmen for the defense should be novelists , since novelists are more sensitive . Mr. Swiggett has written a leisurely romantic tale that only happens , apparently , to have a corporation 's activities as its setting . There is no overt message about business , although the implications are shrewd . Mr. Hawley 's book is more like a tract . He has heard the criticisms . He is reluctant to dignify them by open acknowledgement , but he sees to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero , Don Walling . The ground assumption of both books is that business is a serious activity . If a truly serious meaning is given to " serious , " such as ' appropriate to the dignity we believe possible to all men , " then the books themselves prove the assumption to be mistaken . If the authors mean to suggest that business is the nearest arena in which a man can spend his energies and because it is the nearest , the most important , they are entirely correct . IN " The Power and the Prize , " Cleves Barwick , a bachelor of forty , vice-president of a metals corporation located at 30 Rockefeller Center , is in London working on a deal with a British firm . On a week-end he meets and falls violently in love with Rachel Linka , an Austrian , secretary of an organization providing employment for Continental refugees . He determines to marry her and bring her to America over the anticipated objections of his board chairman , George Salt . When BarwiCk first mentions his plans , Salt rejoices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how old is she , and did her father go to Yale ? " Barwick says he met her in London . " An English girl : well , that 's all right , " Salt says . Then Barwick has to embark on a dreadful recital : Rachel is ( a ) a foreigner , ( b ) a Jewess  --  and later there are rumors- that she may have been ( c ) a prostitute and , worse , ( d ) a Communist in Vienna . ( The rumors , turn out happily to be false . ) Salt , who had regarded Barwick as almost a son , blows hiS stack and expects him to resign . Barwick refuses , and in the following struggle for power it is Salt who is jettisoned . Barwick succeeds him , puts off his wedding for a few days so he can conclude the deal with the British , and at last marries Rachel . " Executive Suite " is the old tale of the death of a king and the choosing of his heir . We have no opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrust into crisis immediately . On page one Avery Bullard , president of the Tredway Corporation ( furniture ) , dies of a coronary occlusion at the age of fifty-six . An autocrat , he has appointed no executive vice-president , and for the next twenty-four hours a tight goes on among the vice-presidents , the controller , and the treasurer to see who will take his place . If you have never read a novel before , you may be puzzled and excited to the very end . If you have read a novel before , you will recognize Don Walling as the new king as soon as he is described . He is young , and it is one of the axioms of business lore that young men have the stuff . He is vice-president in charge of design , and hence his mind is " creative . " After Walling becomes president December 11 , 1954 and prophesies that the Tredway Corporation will soon have 15 per cent of the total furniture business instead of 3 per cent , the book ends . A reviewer for a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the smart young management men fighting for the dignity of their class , " and I believe the authors intended to illuminate this aspect of the current changes in organizational structure . Both heroes are better than their predecessors . George Salt has committed the inevitable sin of growing old  --  he is having trouble with his Vision , and is hypocritical , dishonest , unkind to inferiors , and rotted with prejudice . Barwick has energy and a touch of culture  --  he likes Schumann ? and he can match the suave good manners of his English counterparts . Mr. Swiggett is careful to show him as relatively honest . In London when he carries on a train of deception for a week he is troubled about it and does it only because Salt ordered him to . It is harder for Walling to excel Bullard because Mr. Hawley has deliberately conceived Bullard as a king . His kingly qualities are the usual executive " drive , " a fanatic dedication to the company 's welfare , implied intelligence , and a mysterious ability to spot the false at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is that he could light a spark in men 's minds . This is big medicine , and I am not one to say it is impossible . At the meeting to choose his successor , the directors line up three for Walling and three for Loren Shaw , the controller . Shaw makes a speech asserting that a corporation is an organization devoted to making profits for its stockholders . In spite of its stunning plausibility , his contention turns out to be dramatically ironic . That is not what a corporation is at all . A corporation is like a man , Walling replies . No man can work for money alone . A man has his pride . The force that kept Bullard going was his terrific pride in himself , " the driving urge to do what no other man on earth could do . " Bullard dwindled when he did not think about other men 's pride . Walling will outdo him in that he will " never ask a man to do anything that will poison his pride in himself . " This speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawley 's chief defense of business . It is a dream wish , embarrassing as it stands and more so when we remember that the TredWay Corporation has an assembly line . THESE books are depressing because they assume , blandly and solemnly , that the business world fits down exactly over the whole world with hardly a bay or valley to spare , as if the manufacture of material objects were the only field for the exercise of a man 's best thinking and his finest impulses . There is something pathetic in Bullard 's pride , the urge to do what no other man on earth could do , when the results would be only more bedroom suites , occasional chairs , and sofas . When Barwick " risks all for love , " what is it he risks ? Not life or limb like the older romantic heroes , not his sanity like the newer , not even a job , since a rival firm asks him to write his own ticket as soon as his quarrel with Salt leaks out . What , then ? Not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as vice-president of Allied Materials is precarious , and this is important to Barwick because he has achieved the position only after years of strain and , pre. - sumably , fierce competition . Pride again , and to what end ? If the leader will count the manufactured articles he uses every day that could sink under the sea without disturbing him in the least , I think the list will astonish him . Some things will remain , of course , but there are corporation executives who spend their whole stock of vital energy to supply him with chewing gum , cigarettes , outboard motors , and bug-deflectors for cars . The argument that such things contribute to our well-being and that mak-507 ing them provides employment can be answered by a statement and a question . Well-being is a matter of the spirit as everyone knows in his heart ; and are we to spend our lives using more or less valued articles in order to keep workingmen off the dole ? Yes , I guess we are . Are there any other rewards ? No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elder Morgan and own a big black yacht . Because of the complexity of organization and the planned irresponsibility specialization begets , power tends to be limited and its enjoyment concealed ; it can hardly be a life 's goal to obtain the deference of headwaiters . There are perquisites  --  the two-hundred-dollar overcoats , the suites at Claridge 's , the company airplanes  --  and these may offer satisfaction to a few born poor enough to be permanently impressed . Do these men have any intellectual life aside from their work ? None , apparently . Specialization has taken care of that . All of them have been " educated , " but they seem to be densely ignorant . Except for Barwick , who likes music and is shown reading a book , the arts do not exist . History is what they can remember . Washington is a place to go to about taxes . Mr. Hawley seems to be right . The bale of hay must be pride . Both Mr. Swiggett and Mr. Hawley had long careers in business . Like all novelists , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have reached too far back . A quarter-century is a long time , and business has changed on them . Or it may be that a novel is the wrong medium to use for this kind of defense . Novels are customarily about people , and business tries to eliminatethe individual human being as much as it can . A corporation is not like a man ; it is like a machine , Mr. Hawley notwithstanding . Indeed , there is a growing use of machines to make the really tough decisions , and executive function is constantly narrowed in the interests of efficiency . Yet both authors , caught by the formal demands of the novel , offer their characters as free individuals ? Mr. Swiggett deliberately makes Barwick a rebel  --  and only in the past could such people move freely . Mr. Hawley 's cry for pride is as quaint as a scythe . The areas where pride can be displayed are shrinking every day . Mr. Hawley 's heart , however , is in the right place . And I believe it is his insistence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanical that has made his book popular .
