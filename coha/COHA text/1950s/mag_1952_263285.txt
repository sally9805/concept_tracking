As poor boys hawking papers on the streets of south Baltimore , Tommy D'Alesandro and Jack Pollack were friendly rivals . When they went into politics they stayed rivals . Tommy became Baltimore 's mayor and Democratic national committeeman from Maryland . Pollack , a prosperous insurance broker , became Democratic boss of Baltimore 's fourth state legislative district , and proved in election after election that he could swing 25,000 votes for any candidate he named to his faithful followers . <P> Shipped as a delegate to Chicago , Pollack was sore at the Democratic organization and at Tommy D'Alesandro-so sore that he announced he had n't decided whether to support Stevenson or Eisenhower . Thrown to Ike , Pollack 's 25,000 votes might have meant sure defeat for Stevenson in hard-fought Maryland . <P> Faced with this situation , Tommy D'Alesandro and others took steps to get Jack Pollack into line . Two of Pollack 's lieutenants recently got good political jobs , and Pollack 's son-in-law was made assistant city solicitor . <P> It was n't quite enough . One night Tommy D'Alesandro strolled into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club in northwest Baltimore . It was just an ordinary night , and only Pollack and about 40 of his lieutenants and ward captains were present . Pollack apologized for the turnout , said that if only Tommy had just let him know , he would have had 200 there . But Tommy just wanted to talk to the boys on hand-especially Jack Pollack . <P> Said Mayor D'Alesandro : " What more do you want , Jack ? You got your picture in the Times magazine*-who would ever think that Jack Pollack would get written up in a national magazine ? You 're a great man now , Jack . <P> " I 'm Jack 's friend , " Tommy went on , addressing himself to the meeting , " and Jack is my friend . " Chomping on a cigar , Boss Pollack half restrained a smile . <P> " We need you . Jack , " said the mayor . " Stay with us . If you choose to support the whole Democratic ticket , you 'll make all your friends happy . If you choose to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boys again , the mayor said , smiling : " I suppose that with all this publicity , Jack 's price is going up every day . Lately when I walk around City Hall I wonder if this thing has n't gone too far . I thought we were supposed to have a team . But everywhere I go I see Pollack men . Some days I ca n't find any of my own appointees around City Hall . " <P> Then Tommy broke off . " Come on , Jack , " he concluded , " let 's go in the back room here and talk this thing over . " As the two disappeared , the boys stood up , chatted a while , drifted on home . <P> When Jack Pollack announced last week that he was for Adlai Stevenson , at last , few were surprised-least of all the boys who had been at the Trenton Club . <P> <P> * The mayor meant TIME ( Oct. 6 ) .                @ @ @ @ @
