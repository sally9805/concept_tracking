 | It 's the greatest comeback in theater history . One good picture is all it takes . Now it 's coming down in showers for Sinatra , and everybody in show business is rooting for him . They never stopped ! ABEL GREEN , EDITOR OF Variety . In patter peculiar to the entertainment world , one of its shrewdest chroniclers thus sums up the startling return to popularity of Francis Albert Sinatra , the erstwhile crooning idol of America 's bobby-soxers and bearer of such nicknames as Frankie Boy , Croonatra , King of Swoon , and , more permanently , The Voice . The Voice , it seems , is with us again . Almost any movie-goer can tell you that Sinatra had become a virtual has-been by last year but that he completely revitalized his career recently by playing tough little Private Maggio in the motion picture From Here to Eternity . That bit of casting surprised audiences from coast to coast because it was not a singing part . It was an acting part . And its success was like money from home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only because of his volcanic marital disturbances . That one role skyrocketed sales on Sinatra recordings . It brought him a flood of nightclub and theatre offers to sing again , at fabulous prices . It won him an Academy Oscar ? for dramatic acting ? and got him another dramatic role , that of a psychopathic killer in a movie called Suddenly . It produced an assignment to costar with Marilyn Monroe in Pink Tights , a 20th CenturyFox musical in which he does sing again . In short it returned Sinatra to at least a semblance of the good old days when he was a national phenomenon and a reputed millionaire . o one old enough to vote can forget those " good old days , " the hysterical Sinatra craze that swept this country 's girlhood in the war-torn early forties . Those were the years when the pictured bony , boyish face smiled down , theatre-high , over Times Square , over milling armies of hysterical adolescent fans wearing bobby sox , outsize sweaters , and the traditional Sinatra bow ties . Thousands at a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were always rushed to the scene of a Sinatra appearance , the Sinatra fans continually kept Broadway hideous with their love chant : " Ooooh , Frankie ! We want Frankie ! " It was like nothing experienced by any previous singer , not even by Crosby or Vallee . The nearest approach to it was the mass hysteria brought on by Valentino in his day . Seemingly equipped with radar , the fans knew where Sinatra would appear at any moment and mushroomed there , thousands strong . His simplest shopping trips were like the progress of a cyclone ; the youngsters broke windows and staged riots to see him . They played truant to sit all day through all his stage shows ? one girl reportedly sat through fifty-five ! They interrupted his tenderest notes with their squeals and listened with ecstasy to his then friendly scolding : " Why do n't you kids go home ? " They lay in wait to demand his autograph and to rip off his bow ties and his well-tailored sport clothes , thread by thread . He wore no hat in those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Sinatra trade-mark , was often a target for clutching hands . Some of the more intrepid tracked him home to the modest house he had bought in New Jersey . The fans knew everything there was to know about the house where Frank Sinatra lived with his wife , Nancy , and son , Frank , and little Nancy . This enthusiasm was less pronounced among the male element . One nonbeliever , a boy , started a small riot in a theatre when he hurled an egg at the singing Prince of Swoon . The orchestra broke out with the national anthem , but quite a number of fans received minor injuries . The fans ' opinion of Frank Sinatra was revealed in press interviews and in the letters they wrote him ? five thousand a week in those days . They knew his published biography by heart ? that he was born in Hoboken in 1917 , that his parents were new citizens from Italy , that he had quit high school to go to work , that he hunted up jobs as a singer , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did some boxing , that he got a " professional " start as a singing waiter at a place called the Rustic Cabin , in New Jersey , where the famed trumpeter Harry James heard him over the air and signed him up , that he had a fine young wife named Nancy and two cute children . They knew all his songs of the day : " My Prayer , " " Careless , " " Old Black Magic , " " Night and Day , " " You 'd Be So Nice to Come Home To . " And they wrote him letters in the vein of " You 're one of us . You dress the way we do and talk like us . You know how we feel about things . " Or " Dear Frankie : You never talk down to us , and you seem to be just our age . " Or " When you sing , it 's just for me , and you make me feel grown-up and wonderful . " He was singing with Tommy Dorsey when the thing happened that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not recall which song he was singing , but he was sliding from one note to another in the trick known as  | the slur , or glissando , when a girl listener moaned in ecstasy and slumped to the floor . Whoever that girl may have been , she rates in history as the first of the Sinatra fainters . In that moment she gave the world the King of Swoon . That was sometime in 1942 . Shortly afterward , in 1943 , the success trail opened bright and wide before Sinatra and stayed that way through 1946 . Sinatra made the recording " Sunday , Monday , and Always , " and it sold close to a million copies . Soon he was turning out twenty-four records a year . He was kept busy with radio shows and tours and theatrical appearances . He sang with the leading bands and with renowned symphony orchestras . His easy , relaxed notes filled Lewisohn Stadium in New York and the Hollywood Bowl . He was sitting on top of the world . In the peak years it 's estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has said that he grossed more than a million dollars some years . Certainly there were handsome royalties from records , which sold an estimated ten million a year . He sang on radio programs , had singing parts in motion pictures , and made all the personal appearances he could find time for in the best theatres , night clubs , and hotels . Box-office records often were broken wherever Sinatra sang . He had hundreds of imitators , among them the Sepia Sinatra , the Brooklyn Sinatra , the Sinatra of Mexico , the Poor Man 's Sinatra , the Sinatra for Older Girls . By 1946 he was starring in the movies , making such pictures as The Kissing Bandit , On the Town , Take Me Out to the Ball Game , Till the Clouds Roll By , It Happened in Brooklyn , Anchors Away , all of them adding still further to the fabulous Sinatra income . His singing was enjoyed even by male audiences on USO tours ( Sinatra himself was an arbitrary 4F because of a punctured eardrum ) . But 1946 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be attributed directly to his Hollywood way of life , or whether the wheel was al-ready @#  | starting to slow before he concentrated on a movie career , is anybody 's guess . It was soon apparent , however , that the bobby-sox following , at least , was on the wane ; the Frankie fetish was nonexistent for the new generation of teen-agers , who had real boy friends of their own now that the war was over . And bad reports were beginning to circulate about Sinatra the movie star . It was said that he was extravagant and youthfully irresponsible . His personal living habits were criticized . In Hollywood there were rumors of weekend trips to Mexico that stretched into weeks and slowed down film production at the cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars . There were other incidents . A published statement , " Pictures stink . Most of the people in them do too , " was attributed to him . This was hastily covered over with the explanation that Sinatra had been referring to one scene only , in one of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done his best . ABOVE all there was trouble at home , as one lush star after another took the spotlight with Frank Sinatra . Finally it settled on the sultry newcomer Ava Gardner . For two years Sinatra pursued Miss Gardner over two continents . Nancy Sinatra finally walked alone into a Hollywood courtroom and was given a divorce , the three children , the house in Hollywood , and a third of the Sinatra earnings for life . Sinatra was not present . He was in the-East with Ava Gardner . He and Ava were married in Boston in 1951 amid a photographers ' free-for-all . Almost immediately the much-publicized marriage turned into a series of private and public battlings , violent separations and cooing reconciliations , and reseparations . You can check through hundreds of press clippings on the marriage before you find one that suggests it may last . As this is written there is what appears to be a permanent separation , and preliminaries are being undertaken for a divorce action . Sinatra went to war too with certain members of the press . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ava Gardner . Theirs was an evening wedding , and later the pair posed for photographers and answered questions for forty-five minutes . At the end of that time one photographer demanded an extra picture in what Sinatra considered a threatening way . He offered to punch the man , and the wedding reception threatened to turn into a brawl . Sinatra says of this incident , " I 'd been living through two years of high tension . Then we spend forty-five minutes of our reception posing and that is n't enough ! And they said I was unco-operative ! " There had been other troubles . He had struck one columnist , on a second occasion was reported to have set out with the intention of beating up another . The career troubles worsened . They may have been the effect or they may have been the cause of the now celebrated Sinatra irritability , the battles with the press , and the bad publicity that attended his divorce and remarriage . The record shows only that he parted company with M-G-M , where he  | had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped him . His fame was slipping , and something was happening to The Voice . He sang " Old Man River " on television ; the tired notes sagged , and one reviewer wrote that he had " promise . " He sang at the Copacabana in New York , and another critic wrote , " The old black magic has gone . " Many music stores stopped stocking Sinatra records . He was still a considerable distance from being destitute , however . There was apparently enough margin left over from his early earnings , and from royalties on such Sinatra records as were still being sold , to tide him over for a while longer . And although there may be considerable overstatement in Abel Green 's comment that show business " never stopped " rooting for Sinatra , it is a fact that certain professional people did publicly voice his praises even at this increasingly inauspicious time . Max Gordon , for example , producer of Born Yesterday , My Sister Eileen , took a full-page Variety ad in order to express his high regard for Sinatra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expired in 1952 , Capitol Records signed him to be its leading recording vocalist . Capitol was gambling that the old black magic would return in full vigor when and if Sinatra got over the fatigue and irritability that had given him such a bad press . How right the hunch was is attested by today 's success of recent Sinatra records ? Hit Parade 's - Young at Heart , " which has already sold more than 900,000 pressings , and a recent Sinatra album " Songs for Young Lovers , " which had 150,000 sales within five months after its release . Apparently the record sales are due almost entirely to the Maggio role . How Sinatra got that part , at a time when he was unproved as a dramatic actor and well into oblivion as a singer , reads like a press agent 's dream but is corroborated on all sides . Nobody but Frank Sinatra himself even thought of Sinatra for the Maggio role . Before James Jones ' From Here to Eternity was sold to the movies , Sinatra had read it solely for his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little Italian-American soldier who does everything the hard way , who can not conform , and who dies after a brutal beating in the stockade . IT MAY be that many of Sinatra 's experiences were in his longing to play that role . Looking back , one can see arrows pointing the way . In his early days with Dorsey he slugged a man for making an anti-Semitic remark . His most publicized battle was with a newspaperman , who , he charged , called him a " dago . " His speeches for racial tolerance , his filmed argument for tolerance , The House I Live In , may all have pointed toward the Maggio role . Sinatra says , " I knew I could n't act . I 'd never had stage experience . But I knew Maggio . I went to high school with him in Hoboken . I 'd been beaten up with him . I might have been Maggio ! " In any event he bypassed his business agents and went directly to Columbia Pictures ' chief executive , Harry Cohn . Cohn told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part was for anybody but Sinatra , and that Sinatra was crazy to want such a role .  | Everybody else said the same thing . He was " song and dance . " He needed money . Why did n't he try for a Broadway musical ? He says now that the first to believe he could play Maggio was Ava . She urged Harry Cohn to give him a chance . When Cohn decided to arrange the test , Sinatra was in Africa with Ava , who was on location there for Mogambo . " I caught the next plane for Hollywood , twenty-seven thousand miles there and back , " he says , " and at my own expense . For the test I played the saloon part , where Maggio shakes dice with the olives , and the scene where he 's found drunk outside the Royal Hawaiian Hotel . The next day I flew , back to Africa . From there on it was up to my agents . " So I 'm back in Africa and there 's a wire from Abe Lastfogel , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , I give up . Another wire . The deal looks good . Another ? I have it ! " It meant , first , a salary totaling a reputed $8,000 for the eight weeks spent on the picture . More important , it eventually meant the 1953 Academy Award for Best Supporting Performance by an Actor . You may have seen Sinatra on television the night of the awards . He was sitting far hack in Hollywood 's Pantages Theatre , with his two eldest children . He was wearing a gold medal they had given him of Saint Genesius , the patron saint of actors . On the back was mounted a small gold Oscar , " so if you do n't win , Daddy , you will still have an Oscar . " When his name was called , little Nancy burst into nervous tears . He leaned over to kiss her , then came trotting up the aisle . The applause was the evening 's loudest , and this time it came not from bobby-soxers but from the adult creative men and women who make Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it really did begin to come " down in showers for Sinatra , " as Mr. Green puts it . Recording sales increased sharply , and Capitol Records put Sinatra to work at once , waxing as many tunes as they could find for him . Twentieth Century-Fox signed him for Pink Tights . Producer Robert Bassler gave him the top starring role in Suddenly . Producer Stanley Kramer made a commitment calling for him to share with Robert Mitchu 'm top male billing in Not As a Stranger . The night clubs of Las Vegas , Nevada , whose fantastic profits from gambling enable them to buy virtually any entertainer they choose , went after him and scheduled him for a summer engagement at the Sands Hotel there . He has already sung the title song in 20th Century-Fox 's Three Coins in the Fountain . He does not appear in that picture , but his voice is used with the theme music . To date , no studio has signed him to a long contract , but this situation seems to prevail primarily because picture-topicture deals rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setup and not because of any particular apprehension that there will be another storm of bad publicity . He lives in an apartment and has a housekeeper . Sometime , he says , he wants to build a house in Hollywood , a modern house , but , he adds hastily , that wo n't be for some time . His living conditions , like his marital affairs , appear to be in a state of suspension .  | He sees a great deal of his children . He says of them , " I 've been honest with them , and they are honest with me . Kids are wonderful . They understand us , if we give them half a chance . They know we 're only human . " He has a new Chrysler and two dogs ? corgis , brought from England . He plays a little golf and likes to spend Sundays at Palm Springs , lolling beside someone 's pool . Despite the criticism that attended the divorce from his first wife , people in Hollywood say that Sinatra is handling his new success in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would be difficult for him to encounter the slightest trouble without facing a wave of gossip . Yet there have been no recent reports whatever of questionable conduct , rudeness to the press , public outbursts of temper , or the other faults that have been attributed to him in the past . The feeling is that he seems sincerely dedicated to the project of keeping his current slate clean and getting more jobs as an actor . It may well be that the story of the rise again of Frank Sinatra is simply that the Crown Prince of Swoon has finally grown up .
