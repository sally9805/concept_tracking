A European is astonished to see nearly one thousand men prepare to transact the two most difficult pieces of business an assembly can undertake , the solemn consideration of their principles , and the selection of the person they wish to place at the head of the nation , in the sight and hearing of twelve or fourteen thousand other men and women . . . <P> - James Bryce , The American Commonwealth ( 1893 ) <P> In 1952 , the solemn business was being transacted in the sight and hearing of some 50 million people who were watching the loud , gaudy-and deeply serious-scene through the electric eye of TV . <P> Fate of the World ? Slowly , through Chicago 's hot , traffic-jammed streets , the herd of delegates converged on the convention hall , the International Amphitheater , which swam in the pungent smell from the surrounding stockyards . The delegates were a serious bunch . They seemed to realize that their party and their nation had come to a crossroads . <P> The convention hall itself seemed a touch less garish than usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by quiet greys and blues ( which show up more sharply on TV ) . The face of Abraham Lincoln looked down earnestly on the delegates . An hour behind schedule , pudgy National Chairman Guy Gabrielson advanced to the rostrum , which jutted , like the bridge of an ocean liner , above the floor . " O.K. , boys , " he said , and banged the gavel . <P> The delegates seemed impatient with the time-honored ritual-the prayer , the singing of the national anthem , the welcoming speeches , and the chair 's plea , repeated like an incantation , to clear the aisles . Gabrielson delivered his opening speech , his eyes glued to a gadget on the speaker 's stand known as the teleprompter ( which spells out a prepared speech line for line on a moving band ) . Said he , in a political cliche with a hard core of truth : " The fate of the world is in the hands of these delegates . . . " <P> He ripped into the Democrats , and the delegates roared dutifully , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rules fight between the Taft and Eisenhower forces ( see above ) , which brought the convention 's first tense hours of drama and caused the air-conditioned atmosphere to heat up fast . <P> The Hero . In their hotel rooms , before TV sets , the candidates watched the proceedings that determined their future . Up to the last minute , they had been shaking hands , making speeches , exuding confidence . <P> Ike 's trip across the country from Denver and his arrival in the convention city had been something of a triumph . At station after station , thousands of people gathered to catch a glimpse of him , hear him denounce Taft 's steamroller methods . For a while , after his arrival , Eisenhower forgot politics and attended the annual reunion of the veterans of the 82nd Airborne Division . Amid flickering candles and muffled drums for the dead , Eisenhower wept . He recalled how he had visited the 82nd on the eve of its drop into Normandy , how the men had smiled at him and told him in effect : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the men of the 82nd cheered his words and , again , smiled ..
