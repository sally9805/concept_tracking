For half an hour on CBS radio last week , two oldtimers reminisced nostalgically about their quarter-century on the air in the golden age of radio . It was the 10,000th time before the microphones for Amos ' n ' Andy ( Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll ) . <P> Introduced by the show 's original announcer Bill Hay ( who came out of retirement for the occasion ) , they brought back a few such famous characters as Lillian ( " Madame Queen " ) Randolph and Elinor ( " Ruby " ) Harriet , and recalled some favorite milestones from their script life : Madame Queen 's breach of promise suit against Andy ( " . . . We was engaged 147 times in one year . . . an ' it woulda been more dan dat if we 'd been goin ' steady " ) ; Andy 's first meeting with Kingfish- played by Gosden ( Andy : " Say , scusee me for protrudin ' , stranger , but ai n't you got ahold of my watch chain ? " Kingfish : " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like dat ! One of dese solid gold cuff links of mine musta hooked on your watch chain dere " ) . <P> This week , radio listeners who have been going steady with Amos ' n ' Andy for 25 years were still worried by the bleak - but unconfirmed - rumor that Gosden &; Correll will retire at the end of this season . But , in any case , Amos ' n ' Andy will live on in TV : the TV version ( alt . Thursdays , 8:30 p.m. ) , with Alvin Childress and Spencer Williams in the title roles , is now a CBS package .
