" Do n't forget to speak scornfully of the Victorian Age , there will be time for meekness when you try to better it . " With that challenging epigraph borrowed from James M. ( Peter Pan ) Barrie , a Philadelphia artist named John Maass has written a book ( The Gingerbread Age ; Rinehart ; $7.95 ) defending-of all things - American Victorian architecture . " This was no mean age , " says Author Maass . " In every field of human endeavor , the mid-19th century was a time of frenetic activity and massive achievement . Is it true that the generation which constructed the transatlantic cable and the transcontinental railroad was unable to build a decent house ? The truth is that an enormously creative and progressive era produced an enormously creative and progressive architecture . " <P> Hide- &-Seek.; Serving up his own bold " antidote to long-entrenched clichs " about Victorian monstrosity , Author Maass says that the American architecture of the period was " distinguished by its pleasurable fancy and exuberant color . " Some of the public buildings , e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste , " but they had something more important-CHARACTER . " As for the houses , they provided more comfort , light and air , and certainly had more vigor and imagination than the thin , nakedly simple , conformist boxes of today . " The broken ' picturesque ' exterior made the most of the effect of sunlight , shade and foliage . These are good houses to walk around , to view at different times of day and year . " <P> Inside the Victorian house , Maass finds " a happy , hide-and-seek quality of surprise . " Stripped of its overgrowth of large-figured wallpaper , overstuffed chairs , marble-topped tables , potted plants , shellwork , beadwork , fringed cushions , petitpoint mottoes , bric-a-brac , fretwork brackets and tiered whatnots , " the Victorian parlor with its parquet floor , high ceiling , tall windows and ample fireplace emerges as a very handsome room . " <P> Complete Harmony . Many of the sins attributed to the Victorian architectural era ( 1837-76 ) , says Maass , were committed when the U.S. began to copy older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing a style with only inspiration from abroad . Among the best examples of real Victorian , Maass cites the famed Carson Mansion at Eureka , Calif , ( see cut ) . <P> To Austrian-born John Maass , the American Victorian buildings " are perfect symbols of an era which was not given to understatement . They are in complete harmony with the heavy meals , strong drink , elaborate clothes , ornate furnishings , flamboyant art , melodramatic plays , loud music , flowery speeches and thundering sermons of mid-19th century America . Most of our own buildings stand on the shifting quicksand of insecurity-Victorian architecture was founded on the rock of superb confidence . "
