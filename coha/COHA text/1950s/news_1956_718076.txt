But the renewal of contract negotiations brought little hope for a quick end of , the crippling tie-up. ereaminary arrangements tor the settlement effort were made by Federal mediators in Washington yesterday . They acted as 30,000. coal miners in the " captive " pits owned by the major steel companies were added to the list of workers made idle by the strike . The miners wound up their annual ten-day paid vacation and started an unpaid vacation that will continue for the duration of the mill shutdown . In commons with 50,000 furloughed workers in other steel-dependent indus-1 tries , they will have= to be content with state unemployment ' insurance checks that represent about a third of their normal weekly earnings . Traders on the New York Stock Exchange continued to take a cheerful view of the steel situation .

The stocks of the " Big Three " prdoucers  --  United States Steel , Bethlehem and Republic  --  showed gains of to 1% points in yesterday 's trading . They began moving up after Joseph F. Finnegan , director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service , had indicated joint peace talks were in prospect . The Granite City Steel Company , one of the small companies unaffected by the general stoppage , joined the price increase parade . It raised the price of its products from $8.50 to $12 a ton to offset the anticipated cost of retroactive wage incrases for its workers . Similar price advances have been made by a half-dozen other small producers . Announcement of the joint settlement effort was made by Mr. Finnegan after he had conferred in Washington with David J. , president of the United Steelworkers of America , and other strike leaders . The chief Federal mediator made it plain that he entertained little hope for any swift return to work by the 650,000 strikers . " I 'd like to emphasize that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finnegan said . " The solution lies with the parties , not the Federal Mediation and Conciliation . Service . " Our function is to help in every way we can , but the ultimate solution will be worked out by the union and the companies . There will be no imposed solution . The very fabric of collective bargaining is agreement by the parties , nothing that the Government hands down .

Officials said the committee would agree to meet with the union and the mediators tomorrow . Mr. Finnegan will be assisted in the Pittsburgh negotiations by Clyde Mills , assistant director of the mediation service , and Robert H. Moore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are convinced that a settlement by the end of this month would prevent the pinch of the steel shutdown from becoming so acute that the President would have to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act or depart from the " hands off " attitude he has taken toward the strike . The great bulk of the layoffs thus far have been in railroads , , mines , trucking , ore fleets and other operations directly related ' to ' serving the steel mills . But continuation of the walk-out into ' August would cause a mass spread of idleness in construction and manufacturing . Mr. ! I Finnegan 's decision to call for joint negotiations followed conferences with James P. Mitchell , Secretary of Labor and the President 's chief adviser on ? abqr policy . The . walkout began after the union had rejected an industry offer of a fiffty-two-month nostrike contract , with fixed and nual wage increases averaging 7.3 ' cents an hour , a full-year layoff pay plan and other benefits .
