Letters to The Times Housing for the Aged Governor 's Proposed Program for Suitable Accommodations Backed The writer of the following letter has been a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee on Problems of the Aging since 1955 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Stanley Isaacs has criticized the recent proposal in the Governor 's message to the Legislature for state loans up to $50,000,000 for the purpose of facilitating construction of housing for the aged on a limitedprofit basis . He indicated that his opposition to the Governor 's proposal does not reflect any disagreement as to the urgent need to provide housing for the aged , but rather an objection to " any housing program based on segregation of elderly persons from the rest of the community . " Mr. Isaacs ' misgivings are expressly based on the fact that during one stage of the development of planned housing for the aged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects were located in rural or isolated suburban areas , with resultant loss of contact between the residents and their families and friends . According to authoritative reports , this error is being avoided in current Scandinavian and Netherland projects , which are carefully integrated into community life . Insulation Needed Moreover , the best current thinking in those countries , as here , seems to be that much as the elderly wish some integration with the general community ; they also desire and require a degree of insulation and shelter . While it is often true that " elderly people like to see younger people nearby , " as Mr. Isaacs is quoted as saying , this does not mean that they are anxious to have these youngsters in the neighboring apartments , particularly when the latter indulge in vigorous and late entertaining . These considerations indicate the desirability of a community project in which specially designed apartments for the aged are centered in buildings forming an integral part of the project but somewhat sheltered from the focal areas of noise and excitement . Other important considerations in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recreational facilities for the elderly in a way which is not feasible when they are scattered indiscriminately about a large project . For example , in these centralized buildings provision can be made , without excessive cost , for communal dining halls , lounges and recreational rooms ; for supervision by a trained social worker or nurse ; and for part time attendance of a consulting geriatrician . Hospitalization Costs Whatever costs are involved in furnishing these services must be weighed , of course , against the far heavier costs involved in the present gravely wasteful practice of incarcerating many elderly people in hospitals and nursing homes who could function with tolerable adequacy on the outside given a modicum of supervision , decent living quarters and a combination of companionship and communal recreational activities . It is ' imperative and urgent that a frontal attack now be node upon the problem of providing housing for the aged in really substantial quantity , and in accordance with the most modern concepts . Governor Harriman , who has manifested a serious and sustained interest in all facets of the problem of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Charter for the Aging published in 1956 under his auspices ) , is seeking to come to grips in a realistic way with this housing problem through the medium of the new $50,000,000 loan proposal . The detailed provisions of the Governor 's measure merit the most sympathetic and careful examination . For the program that is here proposed may well be the start of providing for our aged citizens not merely suitable new places to live but an entire new way of life . ALFRED BERINIA N. New York , Feb. 9 , 1957 . Danger Seen in Nationalism To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In his letter published on Feb. 8 A. Chanderli of the Algerian delegation of the Front of National Liberation , in referring to the inhabitants of Algeria , speaks of 1,200,000 French and European colons suppressing the freedom of 10,000,000 Arabs . It would be highly interesting to know on what grounds , except that of conquest , any number of Arabs can claim Algeria as their own , to the exclusion of other conquerors , from the French all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine thing , Out like everything else it can be overdone . Carried to its logical conclusion , it would split up most countries into infinitesimal entities , not to speak of those which , because of the small number or disappearance of the real natives , would become bones of contention . Also let us be frank in- admitting that the newly won freedom enjoyed by some countries does not seem to have done them much good . Their government and economy are mostly unstable , to say the least , and they have become a burden upon us . It now seems to be taken for granted that yeriodically they need and should get a dollar transfusion . A little common sense appears to be in order . With some real goodwill on both sides it should be possible to.reach a mutually satisfactory modus vivendi , where only a fraction of what the French are now spending would benefit the Algerians a good deal more than if they were left to try and V-f4 - themselves by their own bootstraps . S. GYSIN . Short Hills , N. J. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps Over the Years Said to Justify Its Existence To THE EDITOR . OF THE NEW YOffli . Tann ! As an ex-marine who went through Parris Island as a boot in 1946-47 and as a platoon leader candidate in 1951 I would like to comment on Wayne Phillips ' report in The Times of Feb. 12 regarding Brig . Gen. Wallace M. Greene 's remark that " * * ? I have been in the Marine Corps all my life and I never had any idea of what was going on here " ( at Parris Island ) . General Greene 's comment must spring from either naivet ? or a calculated looking the other way in the midst of a messy situation . I , and I 'm sure most other fellows who enlisted in the Marine Corps with me , did so at the age of 17 or 18 and wanted to prove something . Most of us had heard from friends who had been at P. I. how much of a hard time recruits were given ; and the harder it sounded the more of ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cussed at from the time we arrived till we left ; we had sack drills and push-ups in barracks with the windows closed and ? radiators turned on full blast ; we ran around the parade field with rifles held over our heads or drilled with rifles laid across outstretched arms until the latter ached ; we seldom went to the P. X. or movies , and only then when we did well on an inspection ; we had several " field days " each night ; and the d. i. ( drill instructor ) occasionally stomped on a man 's foot to teach him his left from his right . When we arrived at Parris Island our senior drill instructor told us , " I 'm your mother , I 'm your father . If you do n't like the Marine Corps , come and see me . I 'll punch you in the nose and tell you you like it . " His language and ways seemed to me more comical than disgusting , and part of any man 's indoctrination is to learn the thought processes and customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially important in the Marine Corps , where noble thoughts and inspirational acts are masked under a veil of toughness . For example , the same senior d. i. lugged three rifles and several field marching packs back from our hike to the boondocks ( I presume near Ribbon Creek ) , weapons and equipment that belonged to exhausted recruits who could n't stand up . Our d. i. always had the philosophy of " anything you can do I can do better " and he led the pack when we ran around the parade field several times before morning chow . The antagonism he engendered by his petty maltreatment was more than compensated for by his turning a bunch of wise teen-agers ( perhaps bordering on juvenile delinquents ) into a smooth functioning platoon of self-confident men who responded successfully to the challenge . I would n't equate the latter with training to become professional killers . At P. I. they turn out marines , although some people can convincingly argue the point that the cost is high : in terms of individual humiliation and submergence of the self4 As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps hates individualists . " The freal question in the whole reform movement in the Marine Corps is quite fundamental : do we want to maintain a fighting force of men who have said , " I want to jump off landing craft and take the beach regardless of how tough it may be ? " If we say yes , we had better keep the corps the way it is and urge that those who do n't want to be " hard chargers " go elsewhere . If we say no , I do n't think we 'll have A. Marine Corps . I personally never was by assignment and never want to be a " hard charger , " but someone has to be if we want a Marine Corps . Its performance in the last 175 years justifies its existence .
