txt New York went about limited post-New Year activities yesterday relatively unbothered by a strike of 8,000 employes of . eight private bus Companies , and the parties to  --  the dispute made no perceptible move toward settlement . Improvisation was the order- of the day for most New Yorkers in going from point A to point . B. The subway , the automobile , , the hitch-hiker 's thumb ? as well as the pedestrian 's legs  --  were put to good use in the absence of private bus service in all boroughs but Brooklyn and Staten Island . The day 's transit picture , however , provided few clues to what the full impact of the stoppage would be on Monday , when the city will take up its busy ways again in earnest after a long holiday weekend . Subway traffic was not greatly heavier , but taxicab business improved over the first clay of the strike by members of the Transport Workers Union , C. I. 0. , especially in hard-hit Queens and the Bronx . Parking stations had no cause-fircemplaint . New Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a new peace feeler in the form of a statement urging theunion to respond favorably to a call from his three-man mediation committee ? as the companies have done ? " and sit down around the table to work out a settlement fair to all . " Then he added this seri ! . tence : " The mediation committee is authorized to seek any aid which it may feel will be helpful to achieve a speedy and reasonable solution , of the conflict . " Governor Dewey indicated in Albany last night that he planned , to take no further action with refer- ence to the bus strike here . - - Asked at a press conference if he planned any steps , he replied that he had already made available to the city " all the services of the state government , " including these of the State Mediation Board , the Public . Service Commission and the State Labor Department . " All of the services of New York State are available to the city upOil request , " Mr. Dewey declared . " The city has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the Pubs lie Service Commission was " best equipped and could give the kind of fact-finding material that the city should have had three months ago if it was on the job . " Mr. Dewey noted that the State Industrial Commissioner had the power to appoint a fact-finding board to intervene in. labor dis ? putes if requested to do so . Quill-Ignores Mayor 's Plea The Mayor 's plea , and whatever inferences might be drawn from its final sentence , were ignored by , Michael J. Quill , union president . As he has done since last Tuesday , the union leader insisted that he would not take part in the city . sponsored negotiations until the Mayor apologized  --  or proved ? . his charge that the . T. W. U. and the eight struck bus companies were in collusion to force through a rise in fare from 10 to 15 cents . In fact , Mr. Quill broadened the number of committees with which : he would not deal . In addition to the mediation committee , headed by Victor Riesenfeld , clothing chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Mayor 's Transit Advisory Commission , These groups , he added , had been " disarmed " by the Mayor 's collusion charge and their work " loused up . " " What about arbitration ? " Mr. Quill was asked at union headquarters , 153 West Sixty-fourth Street . On the eve of the strike the Mayor had proposed that the Riesenfeld committee be converted into an arbitration board . " That 's out of the question right now , " Mr. Quill replied . He did not say at what point he might be ready to arbitrate the union 's demand for a forty-hour week with ho loss in take-home pay , but he opened the door slightly to the possibility of negotiations through some group or individual not connected with City Hall or not a party to the dispute in its final stages . " When will you ' be ready to talk ? " he was asked . " At the point when some sensible group of citizens will come up with language that is n't doubletalk , " he Quill announced a general said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Broadway , at 2:30 P. M. tomorrow at which " there will be new developments on the bus strike and the whole transit situation , includ : , ing the Board of Transportation . ' I " Like what ? " he was asked . " I 'm not in a position to say , " he answered . " I want to report to the members first . " The Police Department took no chances that the day 's subway traffic would be light . It assigned 1,120 patrolmen and seventeen sergeants to the city 's 295 subway stations on a-round-the-clock basis . As of yesterday afternoon , there were no reports of unusual occurrences , undue congestion or arrests resulting from the strike . Bronx Taxi Drivers Busy Some fortunate motorists parked their cars in unused bus stops , but not on restricted streets . Illegal parking did not notably increase . Car pools flourished and taxicabs prospered by making short runs over routes of struck lines to major transit junctions , especially in the Bronx , which is serviced entirely by the Third Avenue Transit Corporation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said passenger loads were up 20 to 25 per cent . The Board of Transportation not only denied this later but said traffic was even lighter than for a normal Friday and that no extra trains had seen put on for rush hours . East Side aubway lines running to the Bronx carriedsome increased traffic . The dispatcher 's office at I Grand Central Terminal said com1 muter trains were bearing " unexpected " heavy loads . Many Westchester commuters motored to the end of the I. R. T. or IND Divisions , leaving their cars in parking stations . Shipyards on City Island and airlines at LaGuardia Airport provided truck shuttle service between subways and . their installations . Eastern Air Lines , United Air Lines and American Airlines set up such projects . Mr. Quill , bus officials and transit experts were agreed , however , that Monday would be a quite different story . The union leader disclaimed any intention of creating a subway slowdown by ordereg his members to follow to the let'ter the antiquated book of rules of the Board of Transportation . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transit facilities ? over and above the 6,000,000 daily subway riders  --  there would be unprecedented congestion of the underground arteries . It was clear that the subways would be more crowded during off hours because of plans by many business concerns to stagger hours , but how they could possibly be more crowded during rush hours was an unanswerable question  --  or will be until Monday . City Sees No Fare Rise Needed City Hall released a. mass of financial data , gathered by the Transit Advisory Commission , With the apparent purpose of proving that a fare rise was not needed to pay for the union 's shorter workweek demand and that the companies were in good enough financial shape to make a " substantial contribution " toward that end . One unidentified company , according to the statement , will show a net income of $1,200,000 after deductions and taxes . On the basis of the company 's own figures on the property " used " and " useful " in its business , there would be a return of about 8 per cent . But the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bankrupt Third Avenue Transit Corporation , according to the commission , showed an operating profit of $755,000 for the ninemonth period ending last Sept. 30 . " However , " the commission report added , " before they arrived at that figure they deducted from their operating income $695,000 as a charge for the amortization of retired railway property . The retired railway property is nonexistent and constitutes some of the water that is in the Third Avenue - Surface Transportation capital structure . " A fair reading of the company 's figures would establish an operating profit for that nine-month period of $1,451,000 , not too bad an income in the light of what would be a reasonable appraisal of the property 's ' used ' and ' useful ' in their operation . " Edmund P. Collins , vice president of the New York City Omnibus Corporation , said last night that any suggestion that his company could make a " substantial contribution " to the forty-hour week because it was " earning more than a fair return on its property " was " wholly erroneous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Transit Advisory Commission " conclusively show that for the year 1953 the company will earn less than a fair return on its property even with the present wage rates unchanged . " In its references to the union , the commission charged that the T. ? W. U. was seeking fifty hours ' pay for forty hours ' work at a new hourly rate of $2,17 . ( The present hourly rate ranges from $1.66 to $1.7334 with guaranteed overtime of four to nine ' hours a week . ) But , the report went on , the union is unwilling to give up " fringe , give-away or free time . " Calls for Concessions by All " The union membership can attain a forty-hour week , " the report said , " but all must make concessions  --  the city , the companies and the union  --  unless the city and the riding public is to pay the ent. ormous price for it through the nose . " The city 's concession ? as indicated by the Board of Estimate ? would be to forgive some or all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ franchise and other taxes from the bus companies . The Mayor and his transit advisers had hoped the state would join this plan by similar forgiveness of taxes but Governor Dewey jolted those hopes last week . Rudolph Halley , City Council President , recommended last night that the Mayor and his staff of mediators and arbitrators " get busy and make the first move " to settle the dispute . He declared that the issues ' could be solved at once without an increase of bus fares . Speaking on a fifteen-minute television broadcast beamed over WJZ-TV , Mr. Halley said that the New York City Omnibus Corporation , the largest transit company concerned in the strike , was in a financial position to settle its dispute with the union and still maintain the 10-cent fare . He predicted that if . that company reached an agreement " others would follow along . " The Council President described the striking bus drivers as " not badly treated " and added that " many of them average mote than $100 weekly . " While declaring that he believed the drivers should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union head must realize that he should temper the union 's wage demands .
