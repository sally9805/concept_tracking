The holiday season came to subequatorial South America on the crest of a blistering heat wave . In Santiago , Chileans sipping their traditional cola de mono ( monkey 's tail-milk , cinnamon , and coffee laced with aguardiente ) , fanned themselves as the thermometer climbed to 93 . At Via del Mar and Uruguay 's Punta del Este , beaches were jammed . So was the graceful white curve of Rio 's Copacabana , where young cariocas , lampooning a recently revived city ordinance against walking to the beach in bathing suits , donned dinner coats or silver-fox jackets over their beachwear . <P> Christmas shoppers along Buenos Aires ' swank Calle Florida found store windows featuring snow-sprinkled effigies of Santa Claus cheek by jowl with scanty bathing suits , tropical clothing and camping gear . In Argentina 's interior cities of Tucumn , Crdoba and Santiago del Estero , the mercury climbed to 106 . That , announced the Argentine weather man , made it the hottest December on record .               @ @ @ @ @ @
