Laid low by grippe , Strong Man Fulgencio Batista last week wrapped himself in blue pajamas and a blue silk dressing gown and stuck close to the huge master bedroom at his Camp Columbia headquarters outside Havana . But his relaxed manner showed as clearly as his personal flag , * flying from every Cuban fort and armory , that he was boss of the island . <P> For his old congressional opponents of the deposed Pro regime , many of whom were cynically prepared to vote him all the constitutionality he might want , Batista had only scorn . " We have n't even considered their legalistic formulas , " he said . " They do n't fit in with the revolutionary realities of the situation . " Batista would be President again-but he would name the time , and write the ticket . <P> The old regime 's top labor man , Eusebio Mujal , was somewhat more successful in making his peace with the new chief . Quickly calling off a general strike when Pro 's men showed no stomach for a fight , Mujal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor ( C.T.C. ) on the basis of a seven-point program . Chief points : recognition of the C.T.C. , preservation of union gains , job security for Mujal and other leaders . Saying that he will " respect the C.T.C. as an organization , " Batista promised only to leave Mujal on the job " as long as the workers want to keep him . " Strikes and new wage claims , he added , would not be tolerated . Even before this-in fact , from the day Batista took over-sugar mill-owners , manufacturers and hotelkeepers reported a sudden end to such nuisances as wildcat strikes and " disrespect . " <P> Though businessmen were pleased at the change , some of the most respected members of Batista 's wartime government found his latest coup too raw , and held aloof from joining the new regime . <P> * Consisting of five vertical stripes : navy blue , white , red , yellow and green .
