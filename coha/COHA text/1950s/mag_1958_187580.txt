THE PRICE OF GOLD <P> ASKED about the possibility of a change in the 24-year-old price of gold , Britain 's Prime Minister Harold Macmillan last week replied : " That is one of those questions it is even indecent to ask and still more improper to answer . " Nevertheless , the question is rapidly becoming topic A in the world 's financial capitals , and gold itself booms as a major new weapon in the trade war between East and West . The economic possibilities produced a speculative fever that is sweeping markets in London , Toronto and New York City , pushing many gold shares to new highs . <P> Part of the sudden interest is due to the U.S. recession . With price and production largely stabilized by governments , gold-mining companies always grow more attractive in periods of deflation . But far more intriguing to speculators is the hope that gold will be revalued for the first time since 1934 , possibly rising from $35 per oz. to $50 or more . One of the main arguments for revaluation : the U.S. is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be a flight from the dollar . In the last four months alone , foreign purchases have drained $1.2 billion from U.S. gold stocks . If the outflow continues at this rate , it will top $3.6 billion in 1958-a loss greater than in either 1949 or 1954 . <P> - <P> One immediate effect of the drain is that it forced the Federal Reserve to ease bank reserves by $450 million last April to counteract the tightening effect on domestic bank reserves . A much more serious potential effect is on the stability of the U.S. dollar . The U.S. has total Treasury stocks of $21.6 billion , about 67% of the free world 's supply of monetary gold . Since it needs only $11.4 billion to provide the legal 25% gold-backing for the Federal Reserve 's notes and liabilities , the U.S. apparently has a comfortable $10 billion surplus . Actually , this surplus is illusory ; foreign governments and individuals increased their holdings of various U.S. securities callable within one year to a total of $13.7 billion , which leaves the U.S. with a $3.5 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of such a run . Foreign governments would demand gold only under conditions of imminent catastrophe . Much of the outflow , says George Willis , Treasury Director of International Finance , " is due to the normal recovery of Europe . " Since 1950 , Europe has doubled its gold reserves to $8 billion with big gains for Belgium , The Netherlands , West Germany . <P> <P> The Treasury 's view of normalcy is open to question . The switch from inflow to outflow coincided not with the " normal recovery of Europe " but with the U.S. recession . U.S. exports are down a sharp 25% this year , but imports are holding steady , causing a shift in the balance of trade . Some experts even see the accelerating conversion as a calculated campaign to force the U.S. into a price boost . <P> -
