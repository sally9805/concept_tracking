A Tree Grows in Brooklyn ( Columbia ; 2 sides LP ) . Arthur Schwartz 's lively score is as full of good spirits and front-stoop romance as an old-fashioned block party . Marcia Van Dyke and Johnny Johnston sing the love songs ( I 'll Buy You a Star , Make the Man Love Me , etc. ) straight from the shoulder ; veteran Comedienne Shirley Booth comes through with a fine Brooklyn boid in her verce . <P> Piano Moods ( Max Miller , Eadie &; Rack ; Columbia ; 4 sides LP ) . Three new headliners in Columbia 's program to corral the top U.S. pop pianists for its Moods series . Chicagoan Miller will please " progressives " with his tricky beat and boppish chording . Eadie and Rack 's mile-a-minute keyboard calisthenics have more flash than form . <P> Sharkey 's Southern Comfort ( Sharkey Bonano ; Capitol ; 6 sides 45 r.p.m . ) . One of New Orleans ' favorite jazz combos helps prove , with spirited renditions of Temptation Rag , Basin Street Blues and four others , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Mama Will Bark ( Frank Sinatra &; Dagmar ; Columbia ) . A canine switch on Baby It 's Cold Outside ; also the year 's low , so far , for coyly off-color novelties . <P> Tom 's Tune ( Georgia Gibbs ; Mercury ) . Like Sam 's Song and Elmer 's Tune , this new novelty implies that the American male likes nothing better than a bouncy , mildly monotonous fox trot . <P> Red Sails in the Sunset ( Mercury ) ; When It 's Springtime In the Rockies ( Capitol ) . Driven into the ground by bandleaders and songsters of the ' 30s , these hardy shrubs seem to be sprouting again . Current cultivators : Frances Langford , Jo Stafford and Gordon MacRae . <P> Il Barkio ( Spike Jones ; Victor ) . The City Slickers do a bumptious doghouse lampoon of Arditi 's coloratura favorite , Il Bacio . For all their hectic enthusiasm , it falls far short of Clara Cluck 's classic henhouse version of the same old standard in the ' 30s . <P> The Letter ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice going to waste on the caboose end of one of husband Harris ' cornball specials .
