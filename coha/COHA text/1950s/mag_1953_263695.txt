When Massachusetts Americans for Democratic Action invited State Treasurer Foster Furcolo , a onetime ( 1949-52 ) Fair Dealing Congressman , to speak to their state convention last week , they thought they would get the typical pep talk with which ADAers exhort each other to do battle with the " forces of reaction . " Instead they got a sharp jolt : Democrat Furcolo , who is expected to run for the U.S. Senate next year , as much as told them they should pack up and disband . <P> Said he : " A.D.A . has never been able to attract . . . the broad base that is vital to any political movement . . . Leadership that loses contact with its followers . . . is a pitiful and tragic waste . . . Are you undermining or hurting programs that are good for America ? . . . Are you weakening the Democratic Party ? . . . Are you weakening or defeating Democratic candidates . . . ? I think you are . . . You are rendering a disservice to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly or unfairly , the fact is that the public is apt to immediately oppose whatever you support . . . I do not think you should discuss anything at this convention except one question : Should A.D.A . continue or not ? "
