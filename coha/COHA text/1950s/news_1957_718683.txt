Wo n't Yield His Files By JOSEPH A. LOFTUS Special to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , March 26 ? Dave Beck refused to tell a Senate committee today about his financial relations with the union he heads . The president , of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendent to the Constitution as the committee pressed him to say whether he had taken $322 , - 448.80 from the union treasury , for his own use . " I refuse to give testimony against myself , " he declared again and again . He had been advised , he said , " of proposed criminal actions against me " for alleged income tax evasions . In standing on the Fifth Amendment scores of times and refti5:i1 ; , v to talk , Mr. Beck was protecting himself both against such criminal actions and against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had refused to answer questions without invoking his constitutional rights , he would have exposed himself to contempt charges , McClellan States Case Senator John L. T1 cUellan , 1Democrat of Arkansas , chairman . ! ; ) f. 1 he Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field , stated the burden of the case against Mr. Beck at the outset . Evidence had been developed , he said , " that clearly indicates that from the years 1949 through the first three months of 1953 , Mr. Beck took more than $320,000 from the Teamsters Union treasury in Seattle . " Mr. Beck was asked again and again about the total and a breakdown of it , but each time he fell hack on his constitutional rights , relying specifically on the first three articles of the Constitution and on the Fourth and Fifth Amendments . The Fifth Amendment protects a citizen in many areas , such as deprivation of life , liberty or property without due process of law , tile seizure of private prop-. erty without ; just compensation , and double jeopardy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the provision that no person " shall // be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . " The Fourth Amendment is a protection against unreasonable searches and seizures . He brought , his personal papers as requested , he said , but he refused to turn them over , even after Senator McClellan signed a subpoena in his presence calling for these papers . He relied on the two amendments and the first three articles to protect him from possible contempt action . The first three articles detail the separation of powers among the Executive , Legislative and Judicial branches . The union he heads is the largest in the country , possibly even in the world . Its membership ranges between 1,400,000 and 1,600,000 . Three of its vice presidents are under indictment Iand a fourth has been convicted of illegally accepting payments from an employer . Mr. Beck avowed his intention to continue as president of the union and to run for re-election at the September convention . He further declared he would not resign as a vice president of the A. F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not feel bound by that body 's policy statement that although the Fifth Amendment should be preserved , its invocation was not compatible with holding union office . The portly , florid , bald , 62-year-old president of the Teamsters was in the witness chair fifteen minutes before hearing time . Hundreds of would-be spectators were already lined up outside the caucus room . He was accompanied by several lawyers . One of them , Arthur C. Condon , sat at Mr. Beck 's side at the witness table . Mr. Beck identified former Senator James H. Duff , Pennsylvania Republican , as his " chief counsel . " Mr. Duff was not present . " I am following the advice of my chief counsel , former Senator Duff , " the witness intoned repeatedly . Finally the audience broke into laughter at Mr. Beck 's expostulations . Senator Pat , Democrat of Michigan , told Mr. Beck at one point : " I am not a bit impressed by the fact that your counsel is ex-Senator Duff . " Later , Senator Joseph R. McCarthy , Republican of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that " Duff is a defeated Senator who has n't practiced law in twenty-five years . " Thereafter Mr. Beck omitted the former Senator 's riame from his pleadings but Senator McCarthy himself raised the issue later by demanding to know why Mr. Duff was not present . Mr. Beck said he did not know . On March 14 , Senator Duff said he had agreed to serVe as legal counsel for Mr. Beck  --  but not in Mr. Beck 's appearance before the Senate committee . The all-day hearing , however , turned largely on the remark in Senator McClellan 's opening statement that the president of 1 " the largest and most powerful union in our country may have misappropriated over $320,000 of union funds . " Mr. Beck in a television show ten days ago acknowledged that he had obtained interest-free " loans " from the union but had paid back the money . Mr. Beck told Robert F. Kennedy , committee counsel , he was paying his counsel from his own pocket and that he could well afford it . The Teamsters ' president often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary for a living . He has announced that his last income tax payment was $91,000 , which indicates an income of $180,000 to $200,000 . Beck Opposed to Code Democrat of Massachusetts , I Senator John F. Kennedy , questioned the witness about the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . code . Mr. Beck 's reply was : " I certainly do not agree with the code and I opposed the code because in my personal judgment it is a violation of the constitutional rights of the citizens and I am unalterably opposed to any violation of any rights of the citizens which in my judgment far transcends the rights of labor or any other group . " Mr. Kennedy , the committee counsel , questioned the witness about a breakdown of the $322 , - 448 . The largest item was $196 , - 516 . Mr. Kennedy asked whether , Mr. Beck took that amount to pay John Lindsay " for work that was done on Mr. Beck 's home and on homes that were on Mr. Beck 's property . " The witness invoked the Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beck later persuaded the Teamsters Union to purchase for $163,000 , though permitting him to continue living in it . Mr. Kennedy said some $85 , - 000 of union money had been used to pay personal bills , and that it had been channeled through Nathan Shefferman , long-time friend of Mr. Beck and a management consultant on union problems . Mr. Shefferman himself testified toward the end of the day 's session and said he had paid Mr. Beck $24,500 in 1949 and 1950 . That money , he said , was in payment for business that Mr. Beck was able to get for him .
