How 're you gon na keep the boys in uniform after they 've seen high-pay help-wanted ads ? Ever since Korea , that has been the U.S. armed forces ' **26;5495;TOOLONG question . Cooks , truck drivers , and professional privates re-enlist at a brisk rate , but such specialists as radar and missile technicians usually get out when their first hitches are up , taking along with them into better-paid civilian jobs the expensive training that the U.S. Government has given them . <P> Last week Defense Secretary Charles Erwin Wilson issued an order designed to make military service a bit more attractive to skilled enlisted men . Highly qualified technicians-about 350,000 men in all-will get " proficiency " boosts of one or two pay grades ( $12 to $50 a month ) without stepping up in military grade . <P> Too Many Cooks . Apart from technicians who thought they would qualify for the raises , nobody seemed very happy about the Wilson order . Missouri 's Democratic Senator Stuart Symington , onetime Secretary of the Air Force , rapped it as " patchwork . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to solve the nagging re-enlistment problem with so skimpy a measure seemed like trying to bail out a leaky rowboat with a beer can . What the military leaders wanted to see was adoption of the newly released Cordiner report , a thoughtful pay-revision plan drawn up by a military-civilian advisory committee chaired by General Electric 's President Ralph J. Cordiner . Disappointed with Wilson 's pay-boost directive , Cordiner warned him in a letter last week that " benefits can not be achieved by half measures which adopt the terminology but kill the substance of the recommendations . " The substance : <P> Widen pay gaps between ranks so as to give able men more incentive to seek promotion and to stay in service . Under the Cordiner plan , privates and second lieutenants would get the same base pay as now , but a master sergeant 's base pay would rise from $206 a month to $300 and a colonel 's from $592 to $850 . <P> Abolish the moss-backed longevity system under which a sway-backed corporal with 24 years of service can collect more on payday than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proficiency pay " system ( as Wilson did last week ) , and create two new enlisted pay grades above the present ones so that top noncoms could qualify for proficiency pay . Wilson 's directive left master sergeants and chief petty officers , already in the top pay grade , with no hope for proficiency raises . <P> Improve the quality and efficiency of personnel , e.g. , by refusing re-enlistment to yardbirds and retraining some of the too many cooks to do more vital duty .
