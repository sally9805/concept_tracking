txt Gen. George C. Marshall , retired , drove forty miles in the rain on Wednesday to receive a medal from the Organization for European Economic Cooperation on the tenth anniversary of the speech at Cambridge , Mass. , in which his famous Plan was announced . President Eisenhower came over to Blair-Lee House to shake hands and leave a letter of tribute . The British and French Ambassadors were present . The Marshall Plan was not extem , poraneous . Many men had something to do in drafting the root idea , among them George F. Kennan , Dean Acheson , Will Clayton and Charles E. Bohlen . But the Marshall Plan first appeared as a deliberately described policy in General Marshall 's Cambridge speech . In this speech the Secretary of State , as he then was , declared that " It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace . " He added : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any doctrine but against poverty , despair and chaos . " It was not our fault that Moscow rejected the proposal to study a European recovery program . Such was the beginning of a program subsequently authorized by Congress , fought over ' every year since then in terms of amounts to be appropriated , but rarely in terms of principle , and costing this country down to date somewhere in the neighborhood of $60 billion . Not all of . this expenditure , of course , was part of the designated Marshall Plan . The Marshall Plan as such lasted less than four years , cost about $12 billion and resulted in restoring Western Europe to something like economic health and halting the Communist advance inside the Marshall Plan countries . As the years went by foreign aid took on different names , covered different territories and changed its emphasis . Now the pressure for direbt economic assistance to Western Europe has nearly disappeared , the demand for some sort of aid among friendly countries in Asia has increased and the emphasis has come to rest on military defense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general economy . The attack on this portion of the budget , as on other portions , is this year a little more determined than it has been in the past , but the principle endures , even though the old phrase , foreign aid , is not now accurate . We know , and our friends know , that when we give or grant money abroad we do so as part of a cooperative partnership , not in the role of an easy-going international Santa Claus . General Marshall ten years ago , canvassing his advisers and thinking in terms of his own wide experience , must have foreseen much of what has happened . The gist of what he advocated and what was done was the acceptance of responsibility in peace comparable to that which this nation had accepted in time of war during the administraa tions of Woodrow Wilson and of . Franklin D. Roosevelt . General Marshall may put this new medal with kis other medals in the quiet Virginia home to which he has retired after his many services to his country . It does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ' no doubt inevitable . But they were spoken ten years ago last Wednesday with clarity , eloquence and an emotion that was , in spite of quietness , very warm . The words march on into the future .
