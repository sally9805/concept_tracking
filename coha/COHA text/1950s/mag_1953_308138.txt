No sooner had the Government issued the new decontrols on materials and prices ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) than the law of supply &; demand reasserted itself . In areas where shortages still existed , prices moved up . On the West Coast , crude oil went up 10 a barrel , and Socony-Vacuum predicted a nationwide boost of 1 a gallon in the price of gasoline . Scrap copper , supplies of which had dwindled to almost nothing in expectation of a free market , scooted up 4 a lb. to 25 . Since that was more than the ceiling price on refined copper ( 24 a lb. ) , metalmen were sure that the refined metal will spurt closer to the world price of 36 if its price controls are lifted . Steelmen predicted that prime scrap steel , now at $36 a ton in New York , would soar $10 . <P> The Government 's lifting of quotas on the production of many civilian products , plus its easing of the Controlled Materials Plan , meant that once defense orders on the books are filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first glance , that seemed to be better news than it is . Actually , materials are so short that producers are already turning out as much as they can . <P> In the auto industry , for example , the quota for the second quarter is 1,500,000 cars , whereas materials have been allotted for only 1,250,000 . Automen have had their hands full getting enough metals for even that many cars . With metals still tight , a bigger test will come when &; if ceilings on copper , steel and aluminum are abolished . Since scrap prices are rising , the primary metals are sure to follow if the ceilings come off . <P> Despite the probability of such scattered increases , there still seemed little threat of any overall puff of new inflation . Nevertheless , the Eisenhower Administration was taking no chances . Back into harness as stabilization consultant came James F. Brownlee , 61 , a Manhattan businessman who did stints with OPA and WPB during World War II , at war 's end became deputy director in the Office of Economic Stabilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vance , will help set up new mobilization machinery . Best guess is that Jim Brownlee would make a strong argument for a stand-by control bill for use against any further inflation .
