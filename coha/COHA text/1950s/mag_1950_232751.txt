" To clear the way for general inductions at 18 , the top policy body of New York 's public school system recommended that high schools pack their standard four-year courses into three . Suggested expedients : wider use of summer classes and , " in some instances , " heavier study loads during regular semesters . <P> Such a speedup , the New York regents pointed out , would make it possible for many a student to squeeze in at least a year of college before induction . The regents were not asking New York schools to adopt their suggestion until Washington settles on an over-all national service plan .

Ewing aired an idea of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to give basic military training as part of the curriculum , even though it might mean an extra year in high school.What would be needed after that , Ewing thought , was a Government agency to sift the graduates , determine " how many , and who , will be assigned to military service , to college training , and to industry .
