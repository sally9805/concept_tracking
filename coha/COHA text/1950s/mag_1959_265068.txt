On the white desert of the geographic South Pole , a house of worship was dedicated last week . Its congregation : the 17 men of the Deep Freeze IV outpost in Antarctica . The " Chapel of Our Faith " began when the outpost 's recreation building , where religious services had been held , caved in under the weight of snow . Navy Petty Officer C. Norman Engel , 37 , of Spring Lake . N.J. , requested permission to build a chapel in its place out of spare lumber , and all members of the group worked at the project-painting , decorating , or just shoveling snow . <P> The 16-ft. - square , gable-roofed chapel is topped by a cross and a steeple , which will eventually contain a bronze bell . Inside is an altar surmounted by a reversible cross ( plain on one side , a crucifix on the other ) and a picture of Christ . Flanking the picture are plaques bearing , respectively , a Star of David and a lotus leaf to symbolize Buddhism . The chapel 's congregation contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Buddhism , and each will take turns giving Sunday sermons on his faith . The group at first regretted that they had no Moslem , but then decided that it was just as well , since Moslems ' pray at sundown and the Deep Freeze sun sets only once a year . " Now it can truly be said , " reads the inscription on the chapel wall , " that the earth turns on a point of faith . "
