The Marines sing From the Halls of Montezuma , the Navy sings Anchor 's Aweigh , the Air Force sings Off We Go Into the Wild Blue Yonder , but the nearest thing to an Army theme song is the old horse-artillery number , The Caissons Go Rolling Along-and few soldiers have seen a caisson since World War I. <P> Last year Army Secretary Frank Pace decided to find an " all-Army " song . He set up a civilian-manned Army song board ( from ASCAP , B.M.I , and six record companies ) , and by last week some 700 tunesmiths had sent in their entries . <P> The winning number : The Army 's Always There , by Sam H. ( Do n't Sit Under the Apple Tree Stept . <P> To a bouncy , football-rally tune , Stept had set some conventionally cheerful words . Sample : When there 's trouble brewing anywhere , You can bet the Army 's always there ; Any place on earth we prove our worth , Ready to do our share . <P> In an effort to avoid offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may gripe and yell/ But we fight like hell " there is now an inoffensive alternate : " But we 'll fight , fight , fight/ Fight with all our might . " The song will have its official unveiling this week when Secretary Pace introduces it on Jane Froman 's TV show . After that , the Pentagon will wait three months to see whether it catches on . If not , the song board will look around for another .
