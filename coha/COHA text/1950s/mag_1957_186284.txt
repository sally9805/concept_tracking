THE story of the South 's desegre- gation is sometimes told in violence and often in warming progress ; there is news of legal skirmishes and noise of rebel yells .

TIME has recorded this story week by week , and also turned the spotlight on its leaders : on Negro Lawyer Thurgood Marshall ( Sept. 19 , 1955 ) , who did much to win a major battle for his people before the Supreme Court , and on Mississippi 's Senator James O. Eastland ( March 26 ) , whose tradition and training have set him against integration every step of the way . This week , in writing of Montgomery 's Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , TIME examines a turn in the struggle that neither Lawyer Marshall nor Senator Eastland could have predicted , and measures the effect that one Negro minister 's faith has had on the people around him , white and black .

" Last week , as evidence to the contrary , France acted to forestall future Algerias , by launching a new deal in " Black Africa " - the little-known French domain that sprawls all the way from below the Equator to the Sahara .
