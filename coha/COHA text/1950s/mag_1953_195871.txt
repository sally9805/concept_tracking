LONDON CALLING NORTH POLE ( 208 pp. ) -H . J. Giskes-British Book Centre ( $3.50 ) . <P> The decisive moment for Operation North Pole came at 2 p.m. on March 15 , 1942 . At that moment H. M. G. Lauwers , a Dutch agent of British Intelligence , sat in a German police headquarters near The Hague with his hand on the radio key that was his link with London . The Germans wanted to make the link theirs ; Lauwers , recently arrested , had agreed to cooperate . Suspecting that Lauwers might doublecross them , the Germans were ready to jam the signal at the first misplaced dot or dash . But Lauwers had no intention of straying from his captors ' text ; his British instructions , he says , called for him to garble every 16th letter . By omitting the prearranged errors , he would be informing London that he had been caught . <P> Lauwers sent , and London replied . German Intelligence had established direct contact with the British Secret Service . <P> A question remained : Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a zone be prepared for an " important drop . " In the early hours of March 28 , at an isolated spot near Steenwijk , the Germans signaled in a twin-engine bomber on a triangle of lights . Silhouetted against the moonlight , the bomber swept down to 600 feet , as the Germans wondered if the important drop would turn out to be bombs . An instant later , five " gigantic black shadows " parachuted down-four containers of material , and an agent . The British had seemingly forgotten their own verification checks , and handed over the key to their Dutch communications . <P> A Deadly Hoax . In London Calling North Pole , Lieut . Colonel H. J. Giskes , onetime chief of German military counterespionage in The Netherlands , tells how he masterminded Operation North Pole and supplied the British Secret Service with the kind of secret service it is unaccustomed to getting . For 20 tragic months the deadly hoax continued , as German Intelligence handled the Dutch operations of British Intelligence and received almost 200 drops of men and material . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of automatic firearms with enormous quantities of ammunition , and mountains of machine pistols and machine guns " were dropped into waiting German hands . Posing as resistance men , German reception committees greeted 54 British agents , pumped them of the secrets they knew , then threw them into jail . The Nazis executed 47 , despite Giskes ' promise that their lives would be spared . <P> To buttress London 's confidence , Giskes produced " results " which the British would learn about from other sources . He planted in the Dutch press articles about spurious exploits , staged a spectacular explosion of a junk-laden barge in the Maas River at Rotterdam , and even returned some downed British flyers through Spain , secretly chaperoned by German agents .
