Britain is on the brink of bankruptcy , but the British people , who have lived so long in peril that they have become inured to crisis , seem the last to realize it . For one thing , the crisis in its present dimensions affects the nation as such , rather than the people as individuals ; only later will they feel the result of inequalities in a worldwide exchange of goods far from the British hearth . Last week , in a speech that rang with the fervor of olden days , Winston Churchill did his best to shake the British out of their complacency . The crisis is " scarcely less vital , " said he , than the dire days when the Nazis rained bombs over London . <P> The Trap . " I have never seen a people look better or more carefree , " the Prime Minister told the British Press Association luncheon in London . " What I wonder is whether they have realized the treacherous trap door on which it all stands . It is an alert that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alarm . We have never been beaten yet , and now we fight not for vainglory or pomp but for our survival . . . <P> " Thanks to the unpopular measures that have already been taken by the Chancellor , we have reached in the last six months a position of equipoise . Our head is above water , but it is not enough to float . We have to swim . . . and we have to swim against the stream . At the moment , we can say we are holding our own . . . but we can not be satisfied with that . We can not live from hand to mouth and from month to month in this world of change and turmoil . We must create by long and steady systems of trade and exchange throughout our Empire and Commonwealth , and throughout the wider world , reserves of strength and solvency which enable us to rise solid , steadfast and superior . . . Thus and thus alone can we stand firm and unbroken against all the winds that blow . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a spate of speculation that Britain 's bank balance was lower than even the bankers suspected . Pundits in the financial district wondered whether dollar reserves might fall so low that the pound would be devalued again . Cripps devalued the pound in 1949 when Britain 's dollar reserves fell to $1.3 billion ; they rose to $3.8 billion at the end of June 1951 . By the end of last March they were down to $1.7 billion again . After Churchill 's speech , the Financial Times sternly demanded " the whole truth . " Next day the House of Commons was packed , as members gathered gloomily to hear the worst . <P> It failed to materialize . Imperturbable Chancellor Rab Butler proceeded to paint a picture that differed substantially in tone from Churchill 's dark hues . " Since the end of March , " he reported , " our gold and dollar reserves have fallen by less than $28 million . This loss in nearly 2 months compares with a loss of $935 million in the last three months of 1951 and $635 million in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position , and have had a welcome and definite respite in the loss of our reserves .
