yellow . These guys over here are fighting my battle for respect . . understand that ? " " I think so . " " Well , damned if I understand it . " He sat beside Karen and examined the lump on her head . " That do n't look too bad . I told those Limey bastards to take you to a hospital . " " I 'll be all right , " she said . Later that night the Palmach staged a raid on the Atlit camp and another two hundred of the refugees escaped through a gaping hole blown in the barbed wire . Karen and Bill Fry were not among the escapees . When the full report of the Star of David episode reached Whitehallthe British realized they had to change their immigration policy . To date , the illegal runners had brought in loads of a few hundred . This ship had carried nearly two thousand , and the greater part of them had escaped in the beaching at Caesarea and the subsequent raid on Atlit . The British were faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that one out of every six Jews in Palestine had entered illegally . And so the British were caught in a tangle . They were as far away from a final answer on the Palestine problem as they ever had been , and so it was decided that the Jews must be turned away from Palestineand not kept at Atlit . The camps on Cyprus were established as a direct result of the pressure of illegal immigration and specifically of the success of the Star of David expedition . Karen l lansen Clement was sent to the island of Cyprus on a British prison ship and interned in the Caraolos camp . But even as the Karpathos/Star of David lay wedged in the rocks off the shore of Caesarea and the surf pounded her to bits , the Mossad Aliyah Bet speeded up their operations , planning for more ships and larger numbersof refugees to follow in the wake . For six more months the young girl stayed in the swirling dust of Caraolos and worked among her children . Her time in the succession of DP and internment camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived only for the moment when she could once again see Palestine . . . Eretz Israel . . . . The magic words became an obsessionfor her too . Many hours had passed when Karen finished telling her story to Kitty Fremont . During the telling a rapport had been established be/tween them . Each detected the loneliness and the need for companionshipof the other . " Have you heard anything further about your father ? " Kitty asked . " No . Not since La Ciotat , and that was very long ago . " Kitty looked at her watch . " Goodness . . . it 's past midnight . " " I did n't notice the time , " Karen said . " Neither did I. Good night , child . " " Good night , Kitty . Will I see you again ? " " Perhaps . . . I do n't know . " Kitty stepped outside and walked away from the building . The thousands of tents were still now . A searchlight from the watchtower swept over the waves of canvas . Dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coat . The tall figure of Ari Ben Canaan walked toward her and stopped . He handed her a cigarette , and they walked silently over the bridge out of the children 's compound . Kitty stopped a moment and looked back , then continued on through the old people 's area to the main gate . " I will work for you on one condition , " Kitty said , " that that girl does not go on the escape . She stays in this camp with me . " " Agreed . " Kitty turned and walked toward the sentry house quickly . CHAPTER EIGHTEEN : The plan which David had romantically called Operation Gideon moved into action . At Caraolos a large batch of bills of lading and British army identification cards were forged by Dov Landau and given to Kitty Fremont . She carried them from the camp and turned them over to Ari Ben Canaan . The delivery of the bills of lading enabled Ben Canaan to complete the first phase of his scheme . During his survey of Cyprus he had becomefamiliar with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a fenced-in area containing several acres of trucks and other rolling stock and a dozen enormous warehouses . Duringthe war the depot had been a major supply base for the Allies in the Middle East . Now some of the stock was still being shipped to British forces in that part of the world . Other stock had been declared surplus and had been bought up by private consignees . There was always some measure of movement from the depot to the Famagusta harbor.  |p102Mandria  's Cyprus-Mediterranean Shipping Company was the agent for the British Army on Cyprus . In that capacity Mandria had a stock list and numbers of all the materials stored at the depot . He also had a very adequate supply of bills of lading . On Thursday at 8:00 A.M. , Ari Ben Canaan and thirteen Palmachniks , all dressed in British uniforms and carrying British papers , pulled to a halt before the main gate of the depot in a British truck . Zev Gilboa , Joab Yarkoni , and David Ben Ami were in the " working party . " Ari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " presented a list of requisitions to the depot commander . Ari 's " working party " had been detailed to gather the listed material and take it to the Famagusta docks for shipment aboard the SS Achan . The forgeries were so perfect that the depot commander did not for a moment remember that Caleb was a spy for Moses in the Bible and that the Achan , a nonexistent ship , carried the same name as the man who stole the treasury at Jericho . The first item the bills of lading called for was twelve trucks and two jeeps . ' They were rolled out of their parking area and checked out to " Captain Caleb Moore . " The " working party " then moved from warehouse to warehouse , loading their twelve new trucks with everything that would be needed for the Aphrodite/Exodus to make her trip to Palestine with three hundred escapee children . Joab Yarkoni , who was in charge of fitting the ship , had drawn up a list of things which included a late-model radio receiver and transmitter , canned foods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blankets , air-conditioning units , a loud-speaker system , and a hundred other items . Joab was very sad because Ari had insisted he shave off his big black mustache . Zev 's mustache met the same fate , for Ari feared this would identify them as Palestinians . In addition to supplies for the Exodus , David took a few tons of the things most urgently needed in Caraolos . Zev Gilboa nearly went to pieces when he saw the British arsenal . In all his years in the Palmach they had always needed arms , and the sight of so many lovely machine guns and mortars and carbines was almost more than he could stand . The " working party " moved with clocklike precision . Ari knew from Mandria 's lists where everything was located . Joab Yarkoni rounded out the afternoon 's work by taking a few cases of scotch and a few of brandy and a few of gin and a few of wine  --  for medicinal purposes . Twelve brand-new trucks crammed with supplies supposedly headedp103for the Famagusta harbor , where both supplies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked the British commander for his excellent co-operation , and the " working party " left six hours after it had entered . The Palmachniks were flushed with the ease of their initial victory , but Ari did not give them time to rest or be too proud of themselves . This was but a beginning . The next stop of Operation Gideon was to find a base for the trucks and material they had stolen . Ari had the answer . He had located an abandoned British camp on the outskirts of Famagusta . It had apparentlybeen used once by a small service unit . The fence was still up , two wooden office shacks and the outhouses remained . Electric wiring from the main line was still in . During the night and for the next two nights all the Palmachniks from Caraolos came to this camp and labored feverishly pitching tents , cleaning the area , and generally making it appear to be once again in service . The twelve trucks and two jeeps were painted the khaki color of the British Army . On the doors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken for any one of a thousand army insignias and the lettering : 23rd Transportation Company IIMJFC . The " company " office had enough actual and forged British papers and orders strewn about to give it an authentic look . In four days the little camp with the twelve trucks looked quite natural and unimposing . They had taken enough British uniforms from the depot to dress the Palmachniks adequately as soldiers and enough of everything else to stock the camp completely . As a finishing touch Joab Yarkoni put a sign over the entrance gate which read : 23rd Transportation Company HMJFC . Everyone sighed with relief as the sign raising officially dedicated the encampment . Zev looked at the sign and scratched his head . " What does HMJF'C stand for ? " " His Majesty 's Jewish Forces on Cyprus . . . what else ? " Joab answered . The pattern of Operation Gideon was set . Ari Ben Canaan had had the utter audacity to form a fake unit of the British Army . Wearing a British uniform , he had established Mossad Aliyah Bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to execute the final phases of his plan using British equipment . It was a dangerous game , yet he held to the simple theory that acting in a natural manner was the best cover an underground agent had.  |p104The  next phase of Operation Gideon became fact when three Americansfrom a merchant freighter landed in Famagusta and jumped ship . They were Mossad Aliyah Bet men who had received training during the war in the United States Navy . From another ship came two exiles of Franco Spain . Often former Spanish Loyalists worked Aliyah Bet ships . Now the Exodus had a crew , the balance of which would be filled out by Ari , David , Joab , and Zev . Hank Schlosberg , the American skipper , and Joab set to the task of refitting the Exodus into an immigrant runner . Larnaca was a small port and Mandria certainly knew the right way to produce silence over any unusual activity around the Aphrodite at the end of the pier . First the cabins , holds , and deck were stripped clean of cabinets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship was turned into a shell from stem to stern . Two wooden shacks were constructed on deck to serve as toilets : one for the boys and one for the girls . The crew 's mess hall was converted into a hospital room . There would be no formal mess hall or galley . All food would be eaten from cans . The galley was converted into an arsenal and storeroom . Crew 's quarters were taken out . The crew would sleep on the small bridge . The loud-speaker system was hooked up . The ancient engine was overhauled thoroughly . An emergencymast and sail were constructed in case of engine failure . There were Orthodox children among the three hundred , and this posed a particular problem . Yarkoni had to seek out the head of the Jewish community on Cyprus and have " kosher " food especially processedand canned for them according to dietary law . Next an exact cubic measurement of the hold was taken , as well as a surface measurement of deck space . Shelves seventeen inches apart were built in the hold . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep on his stomach or back but not the luxury of rolling over . They computed an average height for the children and allotted four feet , eleven inches per child and marked it off down the shelves . The balance of the deck space in the hold and topside was also marked off , allowing a child just enough room to move an inch or two in each direction while asleep . The lifeboats were repaired . Large holes were cut into the sides of the ship and wind pipes constructed so that air would be driven into the hold by electric fans . The air-conditioning units taken from the British depot were also fitted in . Air had to be circulated at all times in the packed quarters to prevent mass vomiting . The work moved along smoothly . The sight of a half dozen menp105working on the old salvage tub appeared quite natural in the Larnaca harbor . Loading supplies would pose another problem . Ari did not want to risk sending the khaki-colored trucks onto the dock , as he felt they were certain to attract attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Exodus stole out of Larnaca each night to a rendezvous cove a few miles away in the Southern Bay . Here trucks from the 23rd Transportation Company HMJFC would come filled with supplies taken from the British depot . A constant stream of rubberboats moved from shore to ship all night until the Exodus was filled , inch by inch . At the children 's compound at Caraolos , Zev Gilboa carried out his part of Operation Gideon . He carefully screened three hundred of the strongest boys and girls and took them in shifts to the playground , where they were toughened up by exercises and taught how to fight with knives and sticks , how to use small arms and to throw grenades . Lookouts were posted all over the playground , and at sight of a British sentry a signal would change the games of war into games of peace .. In three seconds the children could stop practicing gang fighting and start singing school songs . Groups not working out on the playground would be in the classroom learning Palestinian landmarks and the answers to mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take them all to the playground and build a bonfire , and he and some of the Palmachniks would spin stories and tell the children how wonderful it would be for them in Palestine and how they would never live behind barbed wire again . There was a hitch in Operation Gideon , but it developed among ri 's closest lieutenants : David , Zev , and Joab . Although David was a sensitive boy and a scholar he feared no man when aroused . He was aroused now . The first expedition into the British depot had gone so well that he , Zev , and Joab felt it was sacrilegious to leave as much as a shoestring in it . He wanted to run z3rd Transportation Company trucks into the depot around the clock and take anything not nailed down . Zev envisioned even taking cannons . They had gone so long on so little that this windfall was too great a temptation . Ari argued that greed could ruin the whole plan . The British were sleeping but not dead . Twenty-third Transportation Company trucks should appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to attempt to drain the depot would be to hang them all . None the less he could not hold them down . Their schemes beganp106to sound wilder and wilder . Joab had got so cocky that he even went so far as to invite some British officers to the 23rd Transportation Company for lunch . Ari 's patience ran out and he had to threaten to send them all back to Palestine in order to get them into line . In a little over two weeks after the beginning of Operation Gideon everything was ready to go . The final phases of the plan  --  Mark Parker 's story plus getting the three hundred children to Kyreniaawaitedword from the British themselves . The final move would be made when the British opened the new refugee camps on the Larnaca road and began transferring inmates from Caraolos . CHAPTER NINETEEN : Caldwell , Sutherland 's aide , went into the office of Major Allan Alistair , who was the Intelligence Chief on Cyprus . Alistair , a soft-spoken and shy-appearing man in his forties , gathered a batch of papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sutherland 's office . The brigadier asked Caldwell and Alistair to be seated and nodded to the intelligence man to begin . Alistair scratched the end of his nose and looked over his papers . " There has been a tremendous step-up of Jewish activity at Caraolos in the children 's compound , " he said in a half whisper . " We analyze it as a possible riot or breakout . " Sutherland drummed his fingers on the desk top impatiently . Alistair always made him nervous with his quiet , hush-hush ways and now he droned on through several more pages of information . " Dear Major Alistair , " Sutherland said when he had finished , " you have been reading to me for fifteen minutes and the theme of your story is that you suspect that some dire plot is being hatched by the Jews . During the past two weeks you have attempted to plant three men inside the children 's compound and five men elsewhere inside Caraolos . Each one of your master spies has been detected within an hour and thrown out by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages which you have intercepted and which you can not decode and you allege they are being sent from a transmitter you can not locate . " Alistair and Caldwell glanced at each other quickly as if to say , " The old man is going to be difficult again . " " Begging the brigadier 's pardon , " Alistair said , leaning forward , " much of our information is always speculative . However , there hasp107been concrete data handed down which has not been acted upon . We know positively that Caraolos is riddled with Palestinian Palmach people who are giving military training on the playground . We also know positively that the Palestinians smuggle their people into Cyprus at a place near the ruins of Salamis . We have every reason to suspect that the Greek chap , Mandria , is working with them . " " Blast it ! I know all that , " Sutherland said . " You men forget that the only thing that keeps those refugees from turning into a wild mob is the fact that these Palestinians are there . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else at that camp . Furthermore they keep discipline and they prevent escapes by letting only certain people go in and out . Throw the Palestinians out and we would be begging for trouble . " " Then hire some informers , sir , " Caldwell said , " and at least know what they are planning . " " You ca n't buy a Jewish informer , " Alistair said ; " they stick together like flies . Every time we think we have one he sends us on a wild-goose chase . " " Then crack down on them , " Caldwell snapped ; " put the fear of God into them . " " Freddie , Freddie , Freddie , " Sutherland said in dismay , lighting his pipe . " There is nothing we can do to frighten those people . They are graduates of concentration camps . You remember Bergen-Belsen , Freddie ? Do you think we can do anything worse to them ? " Major Alistair was beginning to be sorry that he had asked Fred Caldwell to come in with him . He showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alistair said quickly , " we are all soldiers here . None the less I 'd be less than honest if I reported to you that everything was peaceful at Caraolos and that I thought we 'd be wise to continue to just sit and wait for trouble . " Sutherland rose , clasped his hands behind him , and began to pace the room thoughtfully . He puffed his pipe for several moments and tapped the stem against his teeth . " My mission here on Cyprus is to keep these camps quiet until our government decides what it intends to do with the Palestine mandate . We are not to risk anything that could bring adverse propaganda . " Fred Caldwell was angry . He simply could not understand why Sutherland chose to sit and let the Jews drum up trouble . It was beyond him . Allan Alistair understood but did not agree . He favored a quick ounterblow to upset any Jewish plans in Caraolos . None the less , allp108he could do was present the information ; it was up to Brigadier Sutherlandto act upon it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is there anything else ? " the brigadier asked . " Yes , one more problem now , sir . " Alistair thumbed through his papers . " I would like to know if the brigadier has studied the report on this American woman , Katherine Fremont , and the correspondent , Mark Parker ? " " What about them ? " " Well , sir , we are not certain if she is his mistress , but the fact that she has gone to work at Caraolos certainly coincides with his entry into Cyprus . From past experience we know that Parker has antiBritishleanings . " " Rubbish . He is an excellent reporter . He did a splendid job at the Nuremberg trials . We made a costly blunder once in Holland and the man found it and reported it . That was his job . " " Are we correct in assuming , sir , that it is quite possible Mrs. Fremont'sgoing to work in Caraolos may have something to do with helping Parker do an expose of the camp ? " " Major Alistair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for murderthe jury will not hang you on such evidence as you have just placed before me . " Little red patches dotted Alistair 's cheeks . " This Fremont woman happens to be one of the best pediatric nurses in the Middle East . She was cited by the Greek government for doing an outstanding job in an orphanage in Salonika . That is also in your report . She and Mark Parker have been friends since childhood . ' I " hat is also in your report . It is also in your report that the Jewish welfare people sought her out . Tell me , Major Alistair .. . you do read your reports , do n't you ? " " But . . . sir . . . " " I have n't finished . Let us assume that the very worst of your suspicionsare well founded . Let us assume that Mrs. Fremont is gathering information for Mark Parker . Let us say that Mark Parker writes a series of articles about Caraolos . Gentlemen , this is the end of 1946 . . . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People are generally sick and tired of , and rather unimpressed with , refugee stories . What will impress people is our throwing an American nurse and newspapermanoff Cyprus . Gentlemen , the meeting is concluded . " Alistair gathered his papers together quickly . Fred Caldwell had been sitting in cold and fuming anger . He sprang to his feet . " I sayp109we kill a few of these sheenies and show them just who is running this show ! " " Freddie ! " Caldwell turned at the door . " If you are so anxious I can arrange a transfer to Palestine . The Jews there are armed and they are not behind barbed wire . They eat little men like you for breakfast . " Caldwell and Alistair walked briskly down the hall . Freddie grumbledangrily under his breath . " Come into my office , " Alistair said . Freddie flopped into a chair and threw up his hands . Alistair snatched a letter opener from his desk and slapped it in his open palm and paced the room . " Ask me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy his knighthoodand retire him . " Alistair returned to his desk and bit his lip hesitatingly . " Freddie , I 've been thinking for several weeks . Sutherland has proven utterly impossible . I am going to write a personal letter to General Tevor-Browne . " Caldwell raised his eyebrows . " That 's a bit risky , old boy . " " We must do something before this bloody island blows up on us . You are Sutherland 's aide . If you back me up on this I 'll guarantee there will be no repercussions . " Caldwell had had his fill of Sutherland . Alistair was a relative of General Tevor-Browne through marriage . He nodded . " And you might add a good word for me with Tevor-Browne . " A knock on the door brought in a corporal with a new batch of papers . He gave them to Alistair and left the office . Alistair thumbed through the sheets and sighed . " As if I did n't have enough on my mind . There is a ring of organized thieves on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know what they are stealing . " General Tevor-Browne received Major Alistair 's urgent and confidentialreport a few days later . His immediate reaction was to recall Alistair and Caldwell to London and to call them on the carpet for what amounted to mutiny ; then he realized that Alistair would not have risked sending such a letter unless he was truly alarmed . If Tevor-Browne was to follow the advice of Alistair and make a quick raid on Caraolos to upset any plans the Jews might have , he had to move quickly , for although he did n't know it , Ari Ben Canaan had set the day , hour , and minute for taking the children out of Caraolos . The British announced that the new facilities near Larnaca were ready and a general evacuation of many of the overcrowded corn/pounds at Caraolos would begin in a few days . The refugees would be moved by truck at the rate of three to five hundred per day over a ten-day period . Ari chose the sixth day as the day . No tunnels , no crates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Caraolos and take the children out in British trucks . CHAPTER TWENTYDELIVER IN PERSON TO KENNETH BRADBURY CHIEF , ANSLONDON BUREAUDear Brad : This letter and enclosed report from Cyprus are being delivered to you by F. F. Whitman , a pilot with British Intercontinental Airways . D-Day on Operation Gideon is five days off . Cable me at once that you have received the report . I have used my own discretion on this thing . I feel that it can turn into something very big . On D-Day I will send a cable to you . If my cable is signed MARK that means that everything went off according to schedule and it is O.K. to release the story . If it is signed PARKER then hold off because that means something went wrong . I promised F. F. Whitman $500 for safe delivery of this to you . Pay the man , will you ? Mark ParkerMARK PARKER DOME HOTEI . KYRENIA , CYPRUSAUNT DOROTHY ARRIVED SAFELY IN LONDON AND WE WERE ALL HAPPY TO SEE HER . LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU . BRADMark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be released on signal . Kitty moved from the Dome Hotel to the King George in Famagustawhen she went to work at Caraolos . Mark decided to stay put atp111the Dome in order to be on the spot in Kyrenia when the Exodus came in . He had driven to Famagusta twice to see her . Both times she was out at the camp . Mandria confirmed what Mark suspected . The young refugee girl went to work as Kitty 's aide . They were together all day long . Mark became worried . Kitty should have more sense than to try to bring her dead child to life through this girl . There seemed to him to be something unhealthy about it . In addition there was the business of her carrying forged papers out of Caraolos . There were only a few days left until Operation Gideon moved into the final phase . The tension harassed Mark , and Kitty 's strange behaviorharassed him even more . He made a date to meet her at the King George in Famagusta . As he drove to Famagusta his nerves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ben Canaan and his gang of bandits had run circles around the British . The British were aware that something was happening but they could not for the life of them seem to find the outside workers . Mark marveled at the finesse and skill of Ben Canaan and the courage of the Palmachniks . The outfitting of the Exodus , the training of the children had gone off perfectly . It would indeed be the biggest thing of his career , but because he was part of it all he was very worried . He reached Famagusta and parked beside the King George Hotel , which was much like the Dome in that it sat on a beach with terraces overlooking the water . He found Kitty at a table looking out at the sea . " Hello , Mark , " she said , and smiled and kissed him on the cheek as he sat beside her . He ordered drinks and lit a cigarette and one for Kitty . She was absolutely radiant . She seemed ten years younger than she had that first day in Kyrenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness , " she said in deference to his sour expression . The drinks arrived . " Are you on pins and needles for the big moment ? " " Sure , why not ? " he snapped . Their eyes met over the tops of their glasses . Kitty set hers down quickly . " All right , Mr. Parker . You are all lit up like a road sign . You 'd better start talking before you explode . " " What 's the matter ? You mad at me ? You do n't like me any more ? " " For goodness ' sake , Mark . I did n't think you were so thin skinnedI 've been working very hard ... besides , we agreed it would be bestp112not to see too much of each other during the last two weeks , did n't we ?

The last time you ended up naked with a marine in bed . This time I think you 're going to have the strength to kill yourself . " Her eyes dropped away from Mark 's glare . " Up to the past few weeks I 've been so sane all my life , " she said . " Are you trying to make up for it all at once ? " She put her hand on his . " It has been like being born all over againand it does n't make sense . She is such a remarkable girl , Mark . " " What are you going to do when she goes on the Exodus ? Are yougoing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette and drank her cocktail . Her eyes narrowed in an expression that Mark knew . " What have you done ? " he demanded . " She is n't going on the Exodus . That was my condition for going to work for Ari Ben Canaan . " " You damned fool . . . you damned fool , Kitty . " " Stop it ! " she said . " Stop making something indecent out of this . I 've been lonely and hungry for the kind of affection this girl has to give and I can give her the kind of understanding and companionship she needs . " " You do n't want to be her companion . You want to be her mother . " " And what if I do ! There 's nothing wrong with that either . " " Look . . . let 's stop yelling at each other ... let 's calm down . Ido n't know what you have figured out , but her father is probably alive . If he is n't , she has a family in Denmark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they poison all of them . She wants Palestine . " Kitty 's face became drawn and her eyes showed a return of sadnessand Mark was sorry.  | " I was wrong not to let her go on the Exodus . I wanted to have her for a few months . . . to gain her complete confidence . . . to let her know how wonderful it would be to go to America . If I could be with her a few months I 'd be sure of myself .... " " Kitty . . . Kitty . . . Kitty . She is n't Sandra . You 've been looking for Sandra from the moment the war ended . You were looking for her in Salonika in that orphanage . Maybe that 's why you had to take Ben Canaan 's challenge , because there were children at Caraolos and you thought one of them might be Sandra . " " Please , Mark . . . no more . " " All right . What do you want me to do ? " " Find out if her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to adopt her and get her to the States . " " I 'll do what I can , " he said . He spotted Ari Ben Canaan , dressed as Captain Caleb Moore , coming through to their terrace . Ari walked quickly to their table and sat down . The Palestinian was his usual cold expressionless self . The instant Kitty saw him , her face lit up . " David just contacted me from Caraolos . Something has come up that requires my immediate attention . I think under the circumstances that you had better come with me , " he said to Kitty . " What is it ? " both Mark and Kitty said together . " I do n't know exactly . The Landau boy , the one who does our forgeries . He is now working on the transfer papers for getting the children out . He refuses to do any further work until he speaks to me . " " What do you want me for ? " Kitty asked . " Your friend , the little Danish girl Karen , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kitty turned pale . " We must have those papers completed in the next thirty-six hours , " Ari said . " We may need you to talk to the boy through Karen . " Kitty stumbled from her chair and followed Ari blindly . Mark shook his head sadly , and his troubled glance remained on the empty doorwayfor many moments . CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE : Karen stood in the classroom that was Palmach headquarters . She stared angrily at the boy with the soft face , blond hair , and sweet appearance . He was a little small for seventeenyears and the softness was deceptive . A pair of icy blue eyesp114radiated torment , confusion , and hatred . He stood by a small alcove which held the papers and instruments he used for his forgeries . Karen walked up to him and shook a finger under his nose . " Dov ! What have you gone and done ? " He curled his lip and grunted . " Stop growling at me like a dog , " she demanded . " I want to know what you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use arguing with Karen when she was angry . " I told them I wanted to talk with Ben Canaan . " " Why ? " " See these papers ? They are forgeries of British mimeographed forms . Ben Ami gave me a list of three hundred kids here in our compoundto be listed on these sheets for transfer to the new camp at Larnaca . They are n't going to the new camp . There 's a Mossad ship out there someplace . It 's going to Palestine . " " What about it ? You know we do n't question the Mossad or the Palmach . " " This time I do . Our name is n't listed . I 'm not going to fix these papers unless they let us go too . " " You 're not sure there is a ship . Even if there is and we do n't go they have their reasons . Both of us have work to do right here in Caraolos . " " I do n't care whether they need me or not . They promised to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you think we owe these Palmach boys something for all they 've done for us ? Do n't you have any loyalty at all ? " " Done for us , done for us . Do n't you know yet why they 're breaking their necks to smuggle Jews into Palestine ? You really think they do it because they love us ? They 're doing it because they need people to fight the Arabs . " " And what about the Americans and all the others who are n't fightingArabs ? Why are they helping us ? " " I 'll tell you why . They 're paying for their consciences . They feel guilty because they were n't put into gas chambers . " Karen clenched her fists and her teeth and closed her eyes to keep herself from losing her temper . " Dov , Dov , Dov . Do n't you know anything but hate ? " She started for the door . He rushed over and blocked her exit . " You 're mad at me again , " he said . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend I 've got , Karen .

It was so long ago  --  so very long ago -- CHAPTER TWENTY-TWOWARSAW , POLAND , SUMMER 1939Mendel Landau was a modest Warsaw baker . In comparison with Dr. Johann Clement he was at the opposite end of the world  --  socially , financially , intellectually . In fact , the two men would have had absolutelynothing in common except that they were both Jews . As Jews , each man had to find his own answer to the relationship between himself and the world around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the very end . Although Mendel Landau was a humble man he had thought out the problem , too , but had come to an entirely different conclusion . Mendel Landau , unlike Clement , had been made to feel an intruder . For seven hundred years the Jews in Poland had been subjected to persecution of one kind or another , ranging from maltreatment to mass , murder.  |p118The  Jews came to Poland originally to escape the persecution of the Crusaders . They fled to Poland from Germany , Austria , and Bohemiabefore the sword of " holy " purification , Mendel Landau , like every Polish Jew , well knew what had followed the original flight of the Jews into Poland . They were accused of ritual murder and witchcraft and were loathed as business competitors . An unbroken series of tribulations climaxed one Easter week when mobs ran through the streets dragging each Jew and his family from his home . Those who would not accept baptism were killed on the spot . There was a Jew 's tax . Jews were forced to wear a yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A thousand and one statutes and laws aimed at suppressing the Jews stood on the books . The Jews were moved into ghettos and walled in to keep them isolated from the society around them . In these ghettos something strange happened . Instead of dying slowly , the faith and culture of the Jews deepened and their numbers multiplied . Sealed off forcibly as they were from the outside world , the Jews turned more and more to the laws of Moses for guidance , and these laws became a powerful binding force among them . Inside the ghetto they governed themselves and developed closer-knit family and community ties which continued even after the ghettos were outlawed . For those who ruled Poland the ghetto was only part of the answer of how to deal with the Jews . Jews were prevented by law from owning land or belonging to dozens of trades and crafts in which they might offer significant economic competition . The Jews , locked in their ghettos , made ready scapegoats for any Polish disaster . Periodically mobs , goaded by blind hatred and fed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews and smashed their homes and belongings until Jew beating became an accepted , if not honorable , pastime of the Poles . Four centuries of Jew baiting came to a climax in 1648 . During a Cossack uprising half a million Jews were slaughtered ; the frenzy of the slaughterers was such that Jewish infants were often thrown into open pits and buried alive . The Dark Ages , which came to an end in western Europe , seemed to linger on over the Polish ghettos . The enormous tragedy of 1648 , together with hundreds of years of continuous persecution , created strange phenomena within the ghetto walls . Throughout Jewish history , whenever events were black and hope all but vanished , a dozen or so self-styled " messiahs " would arisep119among the people and proclaim themselves their saviors . In this darkestof moments after the 1648 massacres a new group of " messiahs " stepped forward . Each claimed to have been sent in fulfillment of the prophecies of Isaiah . Each had a strong following . With the messiahs came the Jewish mystics , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . In their desperation for salvation the mystics concocted weird interpretations of the Bible based on mysticism , numerology , and just plain wishful thinking . They hoped through an involved system called the Cabala to find a way for God to lead them from the wilderness of death . While the messiahs proclaimed themselves and the Cabalists looked for hidden meanings , a third sect arose in the ghettos : the Hasidim , who withdrew from the rigors of normal life and lived only for study and prayer . By submerging themselves in prayer they managed to lift themselves from the pain of reality into religious ecstasy . Messiahs  --  Cabalists  --  Hasidim  --  all born of desperation . Mendel Landau knew all this . He also knew there had been periods of enlightenment when the burden eased and the laws relaxed . Poland'sown history was blood-marked . The Poles had struggled for freedom in a series of wars , revolutions , and plays of power . Parts of Poland 's borders were torn away , and there was always an invasion  --  or the threat of invasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought alongside the Poles , placing the cause of the larger nation above their own . Much of what Mendel Landau knew was now ancient history . It was 1939 and Poland was a republic . He and his family no longer lived in a ghetto . There were over three million Jews in the country and they formed a vital part of the national life . The oppression had not stopped with the formation of a republic . It only varied in degree . There was still unequal taxation for the Jews . There was still economic strangulation . The Jews continued to be blamed by most Poles for causing floods when it rained and drought when it was dry . The ghetto was gone , but to Mendel Landau anywhere he lived in Poland was a ghetto . It was a republic , indeed , but since 1936 Mendel Landau had seen pogroms ; and anti-Jewish rioting in Brzesc , Czestochowa , Brzytyk , Minsk Mazowiecki ; and he knew the snarl of the hoodlums who specialized in smashing Jewish shops and cutting Jewish beards . And so Mendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries in Poland , Mendel Landau was still an intruder and he knew it . He was a simple and rather modest man . Leah , his wife , was the plainest of women , a hard-working and devoted mother and wife . Mendel Landau wanted something to give his children as a heritage . He did not have the fervor of the Hasidim for prayer , nor did he believe in messiahs or in the numerology of the Cabala . Mendel retained only a measure of faith in his religion . He kept the Jewish holidays as most Christians keep Easter and Christmas . He accepted the Bible for its historical value as a story of his people rather than as a basis for worship . And so he could not offer his childreneven a deeply rooted religion . What Mendel Landau gave his children was an idea . It was remote and it was a dream and it was unrealistic . He gave his children the idea that the Jews must someday return to Palestine and re-establish their ancient state . Only as a nation could they ever find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His world consisted of feeding a family and providing them with shelter , education , clothing , and love . He did not believe , in his wildest moments , that he would ever see Palestine , nor did he believe his children would ever see Palestine . But he did believe in the idea , Mendel was not alone among the Polish Jews . Of Poland 's three and a half million Jews , there were hundreds of thousands who followed the same star , and from them spouted the wellspring of Zionism . There were religious Zionists , labor Zionists , small militant Zionist groups , and middle-class merchant Zionists . Because he was a trade unionist , Mendel 's family belonged to a labor-Zionist group who called themselves the Redeemers . The entire social life of the Landaus revolved around the Redeemers . From time to time there were speakers from Palestine , there was recruiting work , there were books and pamphlets and discussions and songs and dances and endless hope to keep the idea alive . The Redeemers , like other Zionist groups , ran agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . And every so often the Redeemers sent a group to Palestine to cultivate newly purchased land . There were six members of the Landau family . There were Mendel and his wife Leah . There was the oldest son , Mundek , who was a strapping boy of eighteen and a baker himself . Mundek was a natural leader and was a section head in the Redeemers . There were the two girls . Ruth , who was seventeen , was horribly shy as Leah had been . She was in love with Jan , who was also a leader of the Redeemers.  |p121Rebecca  was fourteen , and there was little Dov , who was the baby of the family . He was ten and blond and wide-eyed and actually too young to be a member of the Redeemers . He idolized his big brother Mundek , who patronizingly allowed him to tag along to meetings . SEPTEMBER 1 , I939After manufacturing a series of border incidents the Germans invadedPoland . Mendel Landau and his eldest son Mundek went into the army . The German Wehrmacht ripped Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mendel Landau was killed in battle along with more then thirty thousand other Jewish soldiers who wore the uniform of Poland . The Landaus were not allowed the luxury of prolonged sorrow for this was a time of peril . Mundek returned from the gallant but futile defense of Warsaw as head of the Landau family . The same moment the Germans entered Warsaw , the Redeemers met to discuss a course of action . Most of Poland 's Jews , being more hopeful than realistic , felt nothing would happen to them and adopted a " wait and see " attitude . The Redeemers and other Zionist groups throughout Poland were not so naive . They were positive that grave danger lay ahead with Germans in occupation . The Redeemers and many of the other Zionist groups decided to stay together and to take group action which would be binding on them all . Some groups chose to flee to the illusion of safety in the Soviet Union which had moved in to gobble up the eastern half of Poland when the Germans invaded . Other groups began an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " underground railway " for escape . The Redeemers voted to remain in Warsaw and build up resistance inside the city and remain in contact with other Redeemer groups throughout Poland . Mundek was voted the military leader although he was not yet nineteen . Jan , Ruth 's secret love , was made Mundek 's second in command . The moment the Germans established themselves in power and Hans Frank became governor , an immediate series of laws were levied against the Jews . Worship , forbidden ; travel , limited ; taxation , excessive . Jews were thrown out of public office , civil or elective . Jews were barred from bread lines . Jews were barred from public places . Jews were taken out of schools . There was talk of a revival of the ghetto.  |p122With  the restrictive laws the Germans embarked upon a campaign of " enlightenment " for the Polish population . This campaign fostered the already prevalent opinion that the Jews had started the war ; and the Germans claimed further that the Jews were responsible for the German invasion , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warsaw and the other cities were plastered with posters depicting bearded Jews violating nuns and other scenes of Jewish " depravity . " Beard cutting , profaning synagogues , and public indignitiesagainst the Jews were encouraged . BERLIN , GERMANYIn Berlin the top Nazi officials wrestled with the " Jewish problem . " Several theories were advanced . Heydrich , the SD Chief , favored holding the Jews for ransom and then deporting them en masse . Schacht , the financial wizard , preferred a slow draining of the financial assets of the Jews . Many ideas were presented and discussed . An old plan of chipping ail the Jews to the island of Madagascar was revived for consideration . Others would have preferred to send the Jews to Palestine , but the British blockade made that impossible . SS Colonel Eichmann had long done " resettlement " work among the Jews . He had been born in Palestine and spoke fluent Hebrew and therefore seemed the most obvious man to be put in charge of the final solution of the Jewish problem . Headquarters were established at Kurfuerstenstrasse 46 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution was reached a mass resettlement program was called for . Most of the Nazis agreed that Poland was the natural place for resettlement . First , there were already three and a half million Jews in Poland . Second , they would encounter little or no public indignationas they would in western Europe . Hans Frank , the German governor , objected to having more Jews dumped in Poland . He had tried to starve the Polish Jews and he had shot and hanged as many as he could . But Frank was overruled by the top planners in Berlin . The Germans cast a dragnet all over Poland to catch the Jews . Raiding parties tore into villages and the smaller towns and rounded up the Jews at a moment 's notice . They were packed onto freight trains , often without being able to take anything with them , and sent to the large population centers . A few Jews learned of the roundups in advance and either fled or tried to buy their way into Christian homes . Very few Poles ran thep123risk of harboring a Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned them over to the Germans for a reward . Once the Jews were " resettled , " an edict was issued ordering every Jew to wear a white arm band bearing a Star of David . Poland was n't like Denmark . The Poles made no objection to the edict , and the Jews wore the arm band and the Star of David on their backs as well . WARSAW , WINTER 1939These were hard and bitter days for the Landau family . The death of Mendel Landau , renewed talk of reviving the ghetto , the resettleinentprogram of the Germans , and the shortages made life very difficult . One morning , early in 1940 , there was a knock on the door of the I , andau home . Polish Blue Police who worked with the Germans were outside . They abruptly informed Leah Landau that she had two hours to pack her belongings and move to another section of Warsaw which had been set aside for the Jews . There would be no compensation for the house and barely time to gather together what Leah had saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the rest of the Jews in Warsaw were resettled in an area in the center of the city near the main rail line . Mundek and Jan moved quickly and were able to get an entire threestorybuilding to serve as home and headquarters for over a hundred members of the Redeemers . The Landau family of five had a single room furnished with cots and a pair of chairs . The bathroom and kitchen were shared with ten other families . The Jews were pressed into a tiny area that ran only twelve blocks in length from Jerozolimksa Street to the cemetery and was a bare six blocks wide . The Redeemers were situated in the Brushmakers ' districton Leszno Street . Leah had managed to hoard a few jewels and valuables which might be useful later , although there was no immediatefinancial need , for Mundek continued to work as a baker and t he Redeemers pooled their food resources in a common kitchen . Jews from the provinces poured into Warsaw . They came in long lines , carrying all they were allowed to take in sacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainload at the siding near the Jews ' quarters . The small area became packed . Jan 's family moved in with the Landau family . There were nine now in the single room . The romance between Ruth and Jan became an open secret . The Gerinans had the Jews set up a council to govern their area ,  |p124but  it quickly became an instrument for carrying out German orders . Other Jews who felt it better to " go along " with the Germans joined a special Jewish police force . The population in the compressed area swelled to over half a million people . At the end of 1940 , one year after the conquest of Poland , the Germansput many thousands of Jews into forced-labor battalions . A brick wall ten feet high was built around the Jewish area in Warsaw . Barbed wire was strung atop the wall . The fifteen exits were guarded by Polish Blues and by Lithuanians . The ghetto had returned to Poland ! Almostall traffic from the ghetto outside the wall ceased . Mundek , who had held a job on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghetto were cut to a level that could barely feed half the population . The only families who seemed to stand a chance of obtaining food were those who held " labor " cards and worked in one of the dozen forced-labor battalions or industries . The creation of the ghetto brought panic . Some Jews began to trade their fortunes for food and some tried to escape to Christian homes . But most escape attempts ended in death or betrayal from the other side of the wall . Life inside the wall gradually became a day-to-day struggle to stay alive . Mundek Landau emerged as a leader . Because of his importance among the Redeemers he obtained a license from the Jewish Council to run one of the few ghetto bakeries . Thus , through a continuation of united action , his group managed to keep alive and fed . All was not blackness inside the ghetto . A very fine symphony orchestragave weekly concerts , schools ran on schedule , little-theater groups were formed . There was always a choice of debates and lectures . A ghetto newspaper was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Secret religious services were held . The Redeemersplayed a major part in keeping these services and activities going . Although little Dov wanted to be more active in the Redeemers , the rest of the Landau family forced him to get as much schooling as he could . MARCH 1941Eighteen months after the invasion of Poland , the final decision for a solution of the Jewish problem was handed down by Adolf Hitler . The order was verbal . Six weeks later SD Chief Heydrich announced the Fuehrer 's decision at a secret conference of SS , SD , and other Nazi officials at Gross-Wannsee . The final solution was genocide.  |p125SS  Colonel Eichmann , the resettlement expert , was put in charge of eradicating the Jews from the face of Europe . Within a few months the Einsatzkommandos  --  Action Commandos  --  were mobilized into Einsatzgruppen  --  Special Action Groups  --  and they swept into Poland , the Baltics , and occupied Russian territory on their mission of genocide . The initial efforts of the Special Action Groups followed a pattern . They rounded up Jews , took them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own graves . They stripped them and forced them to kneel beside their graves and shot them in the head . The climax of the activities of the Special Action Commandos took place in the Russian city of Kiev in a suburb called Babi Yar where thirty-three thousand Jews were rounded up and shot over immense pits in a period of two days . The Einsatzgruppen had a great measure of success because there was no opposition from the local population , which , to some degree , shared the Germans ' feelings toward the Jews . The massacre of Babi Yar was carried out midst the cheers of many approving Ukranians . It became apparent that the methods of the Einsatzkommandos were not sufficient for the over-all plan of genocide . Shooting was slow and clumsy . Furthermore , the Jews were not complying by starving to death in large enough numbers . Eichmann , Paul Blobel , Himmler , Streicher , and dozens of other top Nazis worked out a huge master plan . The plan called for careful selection of secluded sites near railheads and population centers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the best engineersat the lowest cost so that the executions could be carried out on an assembly-line basis . " Top personnel from old established concentration camps inside Germany would be promoted to take over the new establishments . WINTER 1941The Warsaw ghetto saw death in numbers that eclipsed even those in the pits at Babi Yar . People by the tens and hundreds and thousandsstarved or froze to death . Infants too weak to cry died by the hundreds , and old men died by the hundreds too weak to pray . Every morning the streets of the ghetto were strewn with new corpses . The sanitation teams walked through the streets with shovels and stacked the corpses onto pushcarts . Infants , children , women , men : piled up and wheeled off to the crematoriums to be burned . Dov was now eleven years old . He quit school to prowl for foodp126when Mundek 's bakery was closed . Even groups like the Redeemers were in dire straits . Dov learned the tricks of staying alive in a ghetto . He moved about , listened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landau kettle was empty for long periods of time . When none of the family or the Redeemers could get together a meal Leah traded off a piece of her hoarded jewelry for food . It was a long and a cruel winter . Once , when they had gone for five days without food , the Landaus finally had a meal , but Leah 's wedding band was missing from her hand . Then their fortunes took an upswing , for the Redeemers got hold of a horse . It was old and bony and forbidden by their religion as food , but it tasted wonderful . Ruth was nineteen . When she married Jan that winter she was too thin to be really pretty . They spent their honeymoon in the single room they shared with the four other Landaus and three members of his family . But apparently the young couple was able to find some time alone somewhere , for in the springtime Ruth was pregnant . One of Mundek 's major responsibilities as leader of the Redeemers was keeping contact with the outside . Money could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lithuanians , but Mundek reckoned that the money should be saved for more important things . He set out to establish routes in and out of the ghetto " under the wall " through the sewers . It was dangerous to go into Warsaw , for Polish hoodlum gangs were constantly on the lookout for escaped Jews to extort or turn in for reward money . The Redeemers had lost five members who had been caught beyond the wall . The last one , captured by hoodlums and turned over to the Gestapo and subsequently hanged , was Ruth 's husband , Jan . Little Dov was wise to the ways of survival . He went to Mundek with the proposition that he be allowed to take up the job of courier through the sewers . Mundek would not hear of it at first but Dov persisted . His blond hair and blue eyes made him the least Jewish-looking of them all . He would be least suspect because of his age . Mundek knew that Dov was cagey and competent , but his heart would not let him let his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sixth and seventh courier inside of a few days , he decided to let Dov have a try . Mundek reckoned that they all flirted with death each day anyhow . Leah understood and did not object . Dov proved to be the best courier in the ghetto . He established a dozen alternate routes " under the wall . " He became at home in the fetid , slimy , putrid waters that ran beneath Warsaw . Each week Dov took that journey in the blackness through shoulder-high filth . Once " under the wall " he made his way to an apartment at Zabrowska 99 to a woman he knew only as Wanda . After a meal he would return to the sewer , carrying with him pistols , ammunition , money , radio parts , and news from other ghettos and from the partisans . When he was n't making his weekly trip Dov liked to stay at Redeemerheadquarters where Mundek and Rebecca spent most of their time . Rebecca 's job was forging travel passes and passports . Dov liked to watch her and soon began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was discovered that Dov had a remarkable aptitude for copyingand duplicating . His eye was sharp and his hand was steady , and at the age of twelve he was soon the best forger among the Redeemers . LATE SPRING 1942The Germans took a significant step toward the " final solution " of the Jewish problem by erecting several camps designed for the carrying out of mass exterminations . To handle the Jews from the Warsaw area , thirty-three acres were set aside in a place secluded from general view , called Treblinka . Two main buildings contained thirteen gas chambers . There were quarters here for workers and German personneland there were enormous field plots for burning corpses . Treblinka , one of the first such camps , was a forerunner of more efficient models that followed . JULY 1942July brought a day of mourning for all Jews . Those in the Warsaw ghetto and the other ghettos in Poland mourned perhaps more deeply than other Jews . It was the day of Tisha B'Ab , an annual Jewish holidaycommemorating the destruction of the Temples by the Babyloniansand Romans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman invaders nearly two thousand years before had signaled the end of the Jews as a nation . The Jews were thenceforth dispersed to the far corners of the earth . They were , from that day on , a Diaspora . Tisha B'Ab 1942 coincided with major steps in the " final solution " of the Jewish problem . As the Jews of Warsaw mourned both their ancient and present plight German patrols whisked into the ghetto and stopped before the building housing the Jewish Council . To all outward appearances the Germans seemed to be making another roundup for the forced-labor battalions . But this time something sinister was in the air . For the Germans wanted only old people and very young people . Panic swept through the ghetto as oldsters were herded in and the Germans sought out children , most of whom were torn from their mothers ' arms.  |p128Those  rounded up were gathered at the Umschlagplatz and then marched off to Stawki Street near the rail sidings , where a long line of freight cars stood in readiness . Dazed and shocked crowds gathered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun point , and several times the Germans shot to kill . The children were laughing and singing . The German guards had promised them a picnic in the country . This was an event ! Many of them could hardly remember being outside the ghetto . As the train rolled off toward Treblinka the " final solution " was at hand . Tisha B'Ab-1942 . Two weeks later Dov Landau came back from Wanda 's apartment at Zabrowska 99 with a shocking report . The report stated that those who had been rounded up on Tisha B'Ab and in five subsequent roundups had been sent off to death in gas chambers in a place called Treblinka . Further information from other ghettos around Poland reportedthe existence of other such camps : Belzec and Chelmno in the Cracow area , and Maidanek near the city of Lubin were in operation or being readied . It appeared , said the report , that a dozen more camps were under construction . Mass murder in gas chambers ? It did not seem possible ! Mundek , as head of the Redeemers , met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and issued a joint decree for everyone to stage an immediateuprising and break through the wall . The plea was emotional rather than practical . The Jews had nothing to fight with . Furthermore , everyone who held a card in a labor battalion had convinced himself that it was a passport to life . The main reason that no uprising could be staged was that there was no support for it in Poland outside the ghetto . In France , the Vichy government had absolutely refused the Germans ' demands that French Jews be turned over to them . In Holland , the unanimous feelingof all the citizens was to hide their Jews . In Denmark , the King not only defied German edicts but the Danes evacuated their entire Jewish population to safety in Sweden . If the Poles did not agree to the extermination of their Jews , they did not disagree . If they disagreed , they did nothing to show it . Only a very small minority of Polish people would shelter an escaped Jew . Inside the ghetto , each different organized group of Jews embraced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued . The conservatives and the left-wingers argued . Jews liked to argue . In ghetto life argument and debate had always been a great pastime . But now the time of greatest peril had come . Mundek 's Redeemers joinedp129all the diversified groups in forming a unified command . The combinedorganizations carried the initials ZOB , and had the momentous tusk of saving the rest of the Jews in the ghetto . I ) ov made one trip after another to Wanda 's apartment at Zabrowska99 . On each trip through the sewers he carried a message from ZOB to the Polish underground begging for help and for arms . Most of the messages were never answered . The few answers that were received were evasive . Throughout that horrible summer while the Germans continued rounding up Jews for Treblinka the ZOB worked desperately to stave off total annihilation . One day early in September , Dov had a particularly dangerous trip into Warsaw . After leaving Wanda 's he was spotted by four hooligans who chased him into a dead-end alley and demanded to see his papers proving he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wall , and his tormentors closed in on him to pull off his pants to see the circumcision , the sure identification of a Jew . As they set to pounce , Dov took out a pistol he was carrying back to the ghetto and with it killed one of the hooligans and chased the others off . He darted away and loon found the safety of the sewer . Back at Redeemer headquarters the boy broke down under delayed shock . Mundek tried to comfort him . Dov always felt warm and wonderfulwith his brother near . Mundek was almost twenty-one now , but he was gaunt and always tired-looking . He had been a good leader and he worked beyond the limits of exhaustion . He had kept almost the entire Redeemer group intact and had never let their fighting spirit flag . The brothers talked quietly . Dov calmed down . Mundek put his arm around Dov 's shoulder and they walked from headquarters to their apartment . Mundek talked about Ruth 's baby , which was due in a few weeks , and how wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle . Of course , everyone in the Redeemers would be aunt and uncle to the baby but Dov would be the real one . There had been many marriages in the group and there were already three babies  --  all new Redeemers . Ruth 's baby would be the finest of them all . Things were bright , Mundek told Dov , because they had found another horse and there would be a real feast . Dov 's trembling passed away . As they neared the top of the stairs Dov smiled at Mundek and told his brother that he loved him very much . The instant they opened the door and saw the expression on Rebecca'sface they knew disaster had struck . Mundek finally got his sisercoherent enough to talk.  | " Mother and Ruth , " she cried . " They were taken out of the factory . Their work cards were invalidated and they were marched off to the Umschlagplatz . " Dov wheeled around for the door . Mundek grabbed him . The boy screamed and kicked . " Dov ! Dov ! There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to go to Momma ! " " Dov ! Dov ! We ca n't look at her being taken away ! " Ruth , eight months pregnant , cheated the gas chambers of Treblinka . She died in the agony of childbirth and her baby died with her in a cattle car so packed it was impossible for her to lie down . At Treblinka , SS Colonel Wirth , the commandant , was furious . There had been another breakdown in the mechanism at the main gas chambers and another trainload of Jews was en route from the Warsaw ghetto . Wirth had been proud that Treblinka had the best record for dispensing " special treatment " of all the camps in Poland . His engineersinformed him that it would be impossible to get things into working order again before the train arrived from Warsaw . To make matters worse , both SS Colonel Eichmann and Himmler himself were due on personal inspection tours . Wirth had planned to hold special gassings in their honor . He was forced to round up all the old , obsolete gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rail siding to meet the train . Generally the covered vans could accommodate only twenty people , but this was an emergency . By forcing the victims to hold their hands over their heads the Germans could make space for another six or eight Jews . The Germans discovered that there were still several inches between the tops of the heads and the ceiling of the van . In this space they packed another eight or ten children . Leah Landau was in a daze of grief over Ruth 's death as the train pulled to a siding near Treblinka . She and thirty others were taken from the cattle car and forced with whips , clubs , and dogs to get into one of the waiting vans and hold their hands high . When the van held an absolute maximum the iron door was shut . The truck started into motion , and in a matter of seconds the iron cage was filled with carbon monoxide . Everyone inside the van was dead by the time the trucks entered Treblinka and halted before the open pits where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mouths . At least Leah Landau had cheated the Germans , for her gold teeth had been extracted long before and exchanged for food.  |p131Winter  was coming once again and the German roundups were becoming more and more frequent . The entire ghetto moved into cellars , taking everything of value with them . The cellars expanded and some , like the Redeemers ' , became elaborate bunkers . Dozens , then hundreds , of bunkers sprouted and connecting tunnels began to weave through the earth . The sweeps of the Germans and their Polish Blues and Lithuanians netted fewer and fewer Jews for Treblinka . The Germans became angered . The bunkers were so well concealed they were nearly impossible to locate . At last the commander of Warsawhimself entered the ghetto one day to speak to the leader of the Jewish Council . He was angry and demanded that the Jewish Council assist the Germans in speeding up the resettlement program by locatingthe cowards who hid from " honest labor . " For over three years the Jewish Council had been trapped and torn between carrying out Germanedicts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Now , shortly after the German demand for assistance , the leader of the Jewish Council committed suicide . It was winter in the ghetto again . Mundek 's Redeemers were assigned to plan the defense of a section of the Brushmakers ' district . Dov spent his time either in the sewers or in the bunker forging travel passes . Actually his trips " under the wall " allowed him one or two decent meals a week at Wanda 's . On his trips out of the ghetto he now led old people or others unfit for combat . On his trips in he carried arms and radio parts . During the winter of 1943 the death rate became appalling . Out of an original five hundred thousand who had been put into the ghetto , only fifty thousand were alive by the end of the year . One day in mid-January , Mundek and Rebecca took Dov aside before he was scheduled to descend into the sewer on a trip to Wanda 's . " It seems that we do n't have much of a chance just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Dov , " Rebecca said , " we all talked it over here and took a vote while you were in Warsaw the last time . We have decided that we want you to stay on the other side of the wall . " " You have something special for me to do ? " Dov asked . " No . . . you do n't understand . " " What do you mean ? " " We mean , " Rebecca said , " that we have decided to send certain members out to stay . " Dov did n't understand it . He knew the Redeemers needed him . Nop132one in the entire ZOB knew the sewer routes as well as he did . If the ZOB was preparing to stage a defense then he would be more valuable than ever . Besides , the papers and travel passes he forged had helped get over a hundred people out of Poland . Dov looked at his sister and brother questioningly . Rebecca pressed an envelope into Day 's hands . " You have money there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian family to live with . " " You did n't take a vote . This is your idea and Mundek 's . I wo n't go . " " You will go and that is an order , " Mundek said . " It is not an order , " Dov answered . " It is an order from me as head of the Landau family ! " The three of them stood in the tiny earthen room in one corner of the bunker . It was very quiet . " It is an order , " Mundek repeated . Rebecca put her arms around Dov and stroked his blond hair . " You have grown up , Dov . We have not had much chance to spoil you , have we ? I have watched you go into the sewers a hundred times and I have watched you bring us stolen food . We have n't given you much of a boyhood . " " It is not your fault . " " Dov , " Mundek said . " Please do n't deny Rebecca and me this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . You must let us try to give you your life . " " Mundek , Rebecca . I do n't care as long as I am with you . " " Please . . . please . . . understand us . One of the Landau family must live . We want you to live for us all . " Dov looked at the brother he worshiped . Mundek 's eyes pleaded . " I understand , " Dov whispered . " I will live . " He looked at the package and slipped it into a canvas so that it would n't get wet in the sewers . Rebecca crushed his head against her bosom . " We will meet in Eretz Israel , " she said . " Yes . . . in the land of Israel . " " You have been a good soldier , Dov , " Mundek said . " I am proud . Shalom , l'hitraot . " " Shalom , l'hitraot , " Dov repeated . Dov Landau spent his thirteenth birthday in the sewers beneath Warsaw wading to Wanda 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In another day and another world it would have been his bar mitzvah.  |p133JANUARY  18 , 1943Three days after Dov left the ghetto to the temporary safety of Wanda 's apartment the Germans , Polish Blues , and Lithuanians convergedon the ghetto . With only fifty thousand Jews left they began rounding up Jews for the final phase of the " final solution . " The Germans and their cohorts ran into a hail of bullets from ZOB defensive positions . They fled , leaving heavy casualties . The news spread through Warsaw like wildfire ! The Jews were staging an uprising ! That night every ear in Warsaw was tuned to the secret ZOB radio which repeated this appeal over and over and over again : " Fellow Poles ! Today we struck a blow against tyranny ! We ask all our brothers outside the ghetto to arise and strike against the enemy ! Join us ! " The appeal fell on deaf ears . But from ZOB headquarters on Mila Street the flag of the Star of David was raised . Alongside it fluttered the flag of Poland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death beneath a banner which had been denied them in life . The Germans were chagrined at having been chased from the ghetto . Konrad , Gestapo chief of the ghetto security detail , reported to Hans Frank , the governor of Poland , that the matter would be cleared up in two or three days . The Polish people , who had been told previously that the Jews were cowards , were now told that the fighting had been the work of a few lunatics and sex deviates  --  the types who raped Polish girls . ZOB assumed control of the ghetto and disposed of the Jewish Council . The fighters made a swift and merciless reprisal on all known collaborators and then moved into set defensive positions . Hans Frank decided he would not play into ZOB 's hand by making an attack on the ghetto . The Germans decided to laugh off the attack and minimize it . They cut loose with a propaganda barrage and asked the people of the ghetto to come forth for voluntary resettlement and guaranteed they would be given decent treatment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order informing the Jews remaining in the ghetto that they would be shot if they conformed with the German request . there would be no more evacuation.  |p134After  two weeks of quiet the Germans moved patrols in once again to round up Jews . This time they came heavily armed and moved with extreme caution . From carefully prepared positions the ZOB opened fire . Again the Germans fled beyond the wall . The Germans decided to think it all over . Their press and radio were indignant over the Jewish Bolsheviks who were causing all the trouble . While the Germans wailed the ZOB tightened their defensive setups and desperately continued to plead for help from the Polish underground . They expanded their plea to the general public , but no arms came , no underground help came , and only a few dozen volunteerscrossed into the ghetto " under the wall " to fight . The German staff mapped one big crushing assault to wipe out the remains of the ghetto . The day they picked for the attack was the beginning of Passover , the Jewish holiday celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leadership of Moses . At three o'clock in the morning , three thousand crack SS troops flanked with Polish Blues and Lithuanians threw a ring around the entire ghetto . Dozens of searchlights crisscrossed to pick out possible targets for German mortars and light artillery . The barrage lasted untildaylight . At dawn the SS launched their assault over the wall . Converging from several sides they penetrated deep into the heart of the ghetto without resistance . From hidden barricades , from house tops , from windows , the ZOB  --  men and women  --  turned loose a barrage of small-arms fire at pointblankrange against the trapped and surrounded Germans . For the third time the Germans scurried from the ghetto . In blind fury the Germans came back into the ghetto with tanks , and the tanks were met with a storm of gasoline-filled bottles which turned the iron monsters into flaming coffins . With the tanks disabled the German SS troops were forced to flee again ; this time they left several hundred dead in the streets . The ZOB fighters rushed out of hiding to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dismissed and SS General Stroop was called in to take command . He was ordered to destroy the ghetto so thoroughly that no one would ever again dare challenge the power of the Nazis . Stroop mounted attack after attack , day after day . Each new attack utilized a different strategy and hit from a different direction . Each attack and each patrol met the same fate . They were repulsed by thep135ZOB , whose members fought like madmen  --  house by house , room by roo , n , step by step . They refused to be taken alive . Homemade land mines and booby traps , violent counterattacks , raw courage beat the Germans out of the ghetto every time they entered . Ten days passed and the Germans were desperate for a victory . They made a concerted attack on the ghetto 's lone hospital  --  entered , shot every patient , blew up the building , and claimed they had destroyed ZOB headquarters . ZOB teams dressed in uniforms of German soldiers they had killed and used this device to trick , trap , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and time again to hit the Germans from the rear by raiding their arsenals . The Germans continued their attacks and soon , by the sheer weight of their numbers and arms , made themselves felt . The ZOB could not replace a fallen fighter ; once a defensive position was destroyed there was no choice but to retrench ; they could not replace ammunition as fast as they were expending it . Still , with the power on their side , the Germans were unable to get a foothold inside the ghetto . ZOB began calling upon many of the Jews not in fighting units to escape into Warsaw , for there were not enough rifles to go around . Wearing a captured uniform , Mundek led an attack on the Pawiak Prison and freed all the inmates . The three-day cleanup Konrad had promised had stretched into two weeks . On the fifteenth day after the first German assault Rebecca Landau was fighting in a building in the Brushmakers ' district a few blocks from Redeemer headquarters . A direct mortar hit killed every defender but her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was forced into the street . As the Germans closed in on her and cut off all possibilities of retreat , she reached beneath her dress and withdrew a hand grenade . Running at three Germans , she pulled the pin , and killed them and herself . After three weeks Stroop was forced to change his tactics . He had drawn heavy casualties and the Nazis were unable to cover up the valiant action of the Jews with propaganda . Stroop pulled his troops back , reinforced the ring of men and armor surrounding the ghetto , and declared a state of siege . He brought in heavy artillery which blasted into the ghetto at near point-blank range in a determined effort to knock down all the buildings which the Jews had used so well as defensive positions . By night Heinkel bombers saturated the ghetto area with incendiary bombs . Mundek returned to the Redeemer bunker after a staff meeting at LOB headquarters . He and his fighters were half dead with exhaus/tion , hunger , and thirst . Many were badly burned . They gathered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every building . What is standing is burning , " he said . " Have we been able to establish contact with the underground ? " " Oh yes . . . we 've made contact , but they are n't going to help us . We can not expect any more food , ammunition , or water than what we have on hand . Our communications are about ruined . In short , my friends , we can no longer fight according to a fixed plan . Each bunker is on its own . We will try to keep contact with ZOB through runners , but we will each plan and execute our own ambushes and encounters with the Germans when they come back . " " How long can we hold out like this , Mundek ? We have only thirty people left and ten pistols and six rifles . " Mundek smiled . " All of Poland held out for only twenty-six days . We have done that well already . " Mundek assigned his guards , rationedwhat little food was left , and mapped out a dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a battered accordion and began playing a soft , slow tune . In that dank and slimy bunker ten feet beneath the earth the remaining Redeemers sang in a strange and wistfulblend of voices . They sang a song that they had learned as children at Redeemer meetings . The song told them that the land in Galilee in Eretz Israel was beautiful and that wheat grew in the fields and the grain bent softly in the wind . In a bunker in the Warsaw ghetto they sang of the fields of Galilee that they knew they would never see . " Alert ! " a sentry called down as he spotted a lone figure weaving in and out of the flames and rubble . The lights went out and the bunker became black and silent . There was a knock in code . The door opened and closed and the lights were turned on again . " Dov ! For God 's sake ! What are you doing here ? " " Do n't send me away again , Mundek ! " The two brothers embraced and Dov wept . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Everyone gathered about Dov as he relayed the final tragic news that the Polish underground definitely would not come in and that everyone else on the outside was being very quiet about the uprising . " When I came back , " Dov said , " the sewers were filled with people just lying in the muck . They are too weak to stand up . They have no place to go . No one wants them in Warsaw . " And so little Dov returned to the ghetto and a very strange thingp137happened . All over Warsaw and the surrounding countryside Jews who had managed to escape and live as Christians were beginning to return to the ghetto for the last-ditch stand . They had concluded that It was a privilege to be able to die with dignity . MAY 1943At last the furious bombardment stopped . ' Ile fires went out . Stroop moved his SS troops in once again , but this time they held all the cards . The Jews had no defensive positions or communications or fixed plans and almost no food , water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one section at a time and cleaning out bunkers one by one with cannon fire and flame throwers until the union was completely destroyed . They tried hard to capture prisoners to torture into revealing the exact location of the bunkers , but the ZOB fighters preferred to burn alive rather than surrender . They threw open the sewer lids and pumped the sewers full of poison gas , and soon the slimy waters were filled with bodies . Still the ZOB fought on . They lashed out of their bunkers on swift and deadly raids when they could find a German patrol . Suicide squads hurled themselves into certain death . German casualties mounted untilthe number was in the thousands . Stroop pressed on relentlessly . When the Jews became ineffective as a fighting force they kept going on instinct alone . On May 14 , Mundek held a meeting of the remaining twelve Redeemersin his group . He gave them two choices . One was to remain ' lid fight to the last rnan . The second was to try the sewers where Dovight be able to lead them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dov convinced Mundek he could work around the yeas of the sewers that were being gassed . I le made his way in " under the wall , " but as he approached  --  ibrowska 99 instinct told him something was wrong . He walked traight past the building . His sharp eye picked out a dozen men who were watching Zabrowska 99 from various vantage points . Dov did not know whether or not Wanda had been taken by the Gestapo but he did know the place was unsafe . It , was late at night when he returned to the ghetto . It was difficult en for him to locate the bunker , for there were no streets or buildgsleft , only rubble . As he approached he smelled the now familiar Tor of burning flesh . He went beneath the ground and lit a candlep138he always carried in the sewer . Its flickering light bounced off the walls . Dov walked from one end of the bunker to the other and knelt low with his candle each time he came to a body . Direct hits from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not identify them . Dov Landau wondered which of the burned corpses was his beloved brother , Mundek . May 15 , 1943 . ZOB radio broadcast its last message : " This is the voice of the Warsaw ghetto ! For God 's sake , help us ! " May 16 , 1943 . Forty-two days had passed since the Germans had made their first attack . Four months had passed since the ZOB arose and chased the Germans out . As a last gesture SS General Stroop dynamited the Great Synagogue on Tlamatzka Street . It had long been the symbol of Judaism in Poland . As the Temple of Solomon once fell to the Romans , so had the Tlamatzka Synagogue fallen . The Germans announced that the problem of the Warsaw ghetto had reached its final solution . The devastation had been absolute . Nothing stood in the entire area above a man 's eye level . Stroop announced the capture of sixteen pistols and four rifles . Further , that the ruins of the buildings would make good material . There were no prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ZOB fighters who refused to die . Even in the rubble the battle went on . The Jews who had somehow survived began to find each other , and in twos and threes they formed " rat packs " and attacked German patrols by night . The Germans and the Polish Blues swore the ghetto was haunted by ghosts . Dov found six other Jews . They went from bunker to bunker until they were all armed . They moved from place to place but the stench and the sight of death was everywhere . At night Dov led them through the sewers " under the wall " where they made quick raids on food stores . The Jews were rebelling in a dozen other places around Poland , but their risings all met with the same fate . Too Iittle , too late , no support . During all the daylight hours Dov and the six others remained belowground in a newly carved-out bunker . For five long and harrowing months neither Dov Landau nor any of his comrades saw the light of day . One by one they died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , one of starvation . Dov was the last one alive . At the end of the fifth month a Germanpatrol found him close to death . His appearance was not evenp139that of a human being . He was revived sufficiently to be dragged to Gestapo headquarters for questionings , which always ended in beatings . The Gestapo could get nothing from him . Dov Landau , age thirteen , ghetto rat , sewer rat , rubble rat , and expert forger , was marked for resettlement . Destination : Auschwitz ! CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR : Dov Landau was put into an open gondola car with sixty other Jews . The Gestapo refused to believe that he had stayed alive without outside help for five months in the rubble of the Warsaw ghetto . The train moved southward over the icy countrysidein the dead of winter toward Auschwitz . BERLIN , GERMANY , 1940SS Lieutenant Colonel Karl Hoess entered the office of SS Colonel Eichmann , who had been given the task of carrying out the final solutionof the Jewish problem . Eichmann showed Hoess the master plan which was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials . The entire continent of Europe was interlaced with concentration campsand political prisons . Every occupied country was well saturated with Gestapo establishments . Another network of three hundred " combination " camps spanned Europe . Half of them were reserved for Jews . SS Lieutenant Colonel Karl Hoess was impressed with the intricate planning that went into genocide . Despite all these camps and their carefully chosen locations , the bineprinters felt they were going to run into a special problem , and this was why Hoess had been called to Berlin . The Nazis knew they would have tremendous difficulty trying to run extermination camps in western Europe . Furthermore , Poland was more or less centrally located in relation to the Balkans and western Europe . A final , major ramp was needed , one that would serve as a " master model . " In addition to Jews to dispose of there were Russian , French , and other prisoners of war , partisans , political enemies in occupied countries , tcligious fanatics , especially Christians of the Catholic faith , gypsies , criminals , Freemasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberalism , trade unionism , or defeatism . There were suspected foreign agents , prostitutes , homosexuals , and many other undesirablep140elements . All these had to be eliminated to make Europe a fit place for Aryans to live . Such a camp as Eichmann spoke of would handle all these people . Eichmann informed Hoess that he was to be rewarded for his years of faithful service as a Nazi by being given command of the new camp . Eichmann pointed on the map to a small Polish town near the Czech border . A town called Auschwitz . The train bearing Dov Landau and heading south for Auschwitz rolled to a stop at Cracow , a rail center . At a siding on the outskirts many more cars were joined to the train . There were cattle cars holding Jews from France and Greece and coal cars holding Jews from Yugoslaviaand Holland and there were box cars holding Jews from Czechoslovakiaand there were open gondolas holding Jews from Italy for resettlement . It was bitter cold . The biting wind and the snow whipped through Dov in the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn shirt and some little warmth of bodies packed together . BERLIN , GERMANY , 1940  --  41When the Nazis selected Hoess to command the camp at Auschwitz , the major clearing house and extermination factory , they knew well the caliber of the man they had . Hoess had had a long career in the concentration-camp system beginning way back in 1934 when Hitler first rose to power . More recently he had been second in command of the concentration camp at Sachsenhausen . Hoess was a meticulous man and systematic and he carried out orders without questioning them . Furthermore , he was not bothered by hard work . Twenty thousand acres of land were cleared of farms and villages in the Auschwitz area and fenced off . The best construction men , engineers , scientists , and transportation experts and the best of the elite storm troopers went to work on the massive project . An area called Birkenau , two miles from the main Auschwitz camp , was selected as the site of the gas chambers . Birkenau was well secluded and had its own rail sidings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from western Europe , eastern Europe , and southern Europe . The little town of Auschwitz was completely undistinguished and lay in a basin of eternal mud at the entrance to the Silesian mining district . In erecting the camp system the Nazis had to overcome a major objectionfrom their own colleagues . The German Army needed all the railroads and rolling stock it could get its hands on to execute a war on the eastern front . They didp141not like this nonsense of using valuable rail space to cart Jews all over Europe . The Nazis were just as adamant that the final solution of the newish question was as important as running the war . The question was taken to Hitler , who sided with the SS , SD , Gestapo , and other Nazi elements against the German Army High Command . Iloess assumed command of Auschwitz and traveled to Treblinka to study the methods of extermination . He concluded that Treblinka 's commander , SS Colonel Wirth , was a clumsy amateur and said as much . The executions at Treblinka were carried out with carbon monoxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and it used up valuable petrol . Furthermore , Wirth was not systematic and he did not use any measure of deception , so that there were constant rebellions on the part of the Jews . Finally , Hoess felt , Treblinka had been poorly designed if only three hundred people could be executed at one time . When the chambers of Birkenau were opened at Auschwitz , Hoess conducted extensive tests on the first " guests . " He and his scientists concluded that Cyklon B , a crude prussic acid gas , did the job the best . He ordered huge quantities of it from the International InsecticideCompany in Hamburg . The Birkenau chambers were designed to hold three thousand peopleat one time , and with utmost efficiency ten thousand people a day could be exterminated , depending on weather conditions . The train bearing Dov Landau was now nearly fifty cars long . It stopped at the town of Chrzanow , the last before Auschwitz . One out of five persons on the train was already dead . Other hundreds were frozen to the sides of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arms or legs . Many women threw their children over the rail beds and screamed to the curious onlooking peasants to take them and hide them . The dead were removed and stacked in six new cars added on at the end of the train . Dov , though in very bad condition , was keen and alert . He knew exactly what to expect , and he knew that if he ever used his wits he must use them now . The train rolled on again . Auschwitz was an hour away . AUSCHWITZ 1941  --  42Hoess worked to perfect the operation at Birkenau . First he worked out a system of deception that would keep the victims calm to the very end . Lovely trees , lawns , and flower beds were planted around the buildings which housed the gas chambers . There were signs every/where in many languages which read : SANITATION CENTER . The maindeception used was that the victims were going to be inspected and given a delousing shower before being issued new clothing and sent to Iabor camps at or around Auschwitz . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been built . There were pegs with numbers for hanging clothing . Everyone was told to " remember his number . " Hair was cut for " delousing " and the victims were requested to remove their eyeglasses before entering the sanitation " shower . " Everyone was issued a bar of soap with a number on it . They were marched naked , three thousand at a time , down long corridors . A dozen mammoth doors ran along the corridors . The doors opened , revealing enormous " shower rooms . " Most of the guests were too numb to realize quite what was happening and entered the shower rooms quietly . Some began to examine the bar of soap and found it was made of stone . Others discovered the shower heads on the ceiling were fake and that there was no drainage for water . Often a last-minute panic broke out but the Germans were ready now with storm troopers who clubbed and whipped the reluctant into the " shower rooms . " The iron doors were bolted shut . A can or two of Cyklon B was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over in ten or fifteen minutes . Then came the Sonderkommandos . These were clean-up squads of inmates from Auschwitz . They emptied the gas chambers and removed the corpses to the crematoriums . Gold teeth were pulled and rings taken before the burnings . These would be melted down and sent to Berlin . Often a well-shaped skull would be taken for sale to the Germanguards as paperweights . Little attention was given to pictures of families or love letters that were found in the clothing . The troopers were most interested in searching through the linings where jewelry was often hidden . Often an infant was found hidden in the clothes and designated for the next " shower . " Hoess was good to his troops . They worked hard when a large trainloadcame to Birkenau and were rewarded with extra rations and schnapps . His system worked with great efficiency and he never seemed fazed . He did not even get upset when Colonel Eichmann unloaded a quarter of a million Hungarian Jews on him practically without warning.  |p143Hoess  pressed his scientists and engineers for greater efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . One was for a gas chamber with a floor that could be lifted hydraulicallylike an elevator to another level where the crematorium was situated . Other plans were designed to increase the Birkenau capacity to forty thousand executions a day . The greatest bottleneck at Birkenau was the disposal of corpses . At first they were taken directly from the gas chambers to open fields and buried in pits and covered with lime . The stench became unbearable . The SS troops forced the Jewish Sonderkommandos to dig up all the pits and burn the bodies , then crush the bones , Again , open field burning proved too foul-smelling , so inside crematoriums had to he constructed . The train bearing Dov Landau passed through Auschwitz and came to a halt at the siding at Birkenau . Dov was half dead with hunger and blue with cold , but his years of constant contact with danger and death had sharpened his instincts so that even in this state he was alert to survive . Dov knew that the next hour would spell life or death . The doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like him in open cars were ordered over the top with harsh guttural commands . The miserable victims dragged themselves onto a long platform and faced a line of storm troopers who stood in readiness with clubs , whips , pistols , and vicious dogs straining at their leashes . The whips cracked out in the cold air and brought screams of pain . The truncheons thudded against skulls , and pistols shot into the bodies of those too weak to walk . A line was formed , four abreast down the length of the platform , and directed toward a huge station room . The line pressed to the Loom at a slow but steady pace . Dov looked around him . To his left were the trains . Beyond the trains on the road outside the station room he could observe a line of waiting trucks . The trucks were not enclosed so they could not be gas vans , Dov assumed . To his right , past the line of guards , Dov could see the neatly groomed lawns and trees around the brick gas chambers of Birkenau . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knew the area to his right held extermination chambers . The line pressed on . A nausea born of fear racked him . A man staggered and fell , unable to arise . Two snarling dogs were turned loose and ripped the man to pieces . His shrieks set Dov to trembling . He fought to gain control ; he knew that he must show no fear . His line moved into the station room . The large line was split into four single lines , and each line moved toward a desk set up at the far end of the room . A German doctor sat behind each desk , and around each doctor stood a dozen guards and assistants . Dov fixed his attention on the desk ahead of him to try to find out what was happening . The doctor quickly looked over every person as he or she stepped to the desk . The doctor would then order the person to go off in one of three directions . The first way was out an exit on the right side of the room . Dov began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . These people were old or children or appeared in bad condition . Since he assumed the buildings on the right were gas chambers , he came to the conclusion that those being sent out the right exit were going to be put to death immediately . The second way was out an exit on the left side of the room . This exit led to the outside where the line of trucks was waiting . About two out of ten went that way and all of them appeared fit and well . Dov assumed they were being sent to the labor camp . The right door meant death and the left door meant life ! There was also a third group . These people , one in ten or even more , were mostly young women , some quite beautiful . A few teen-age boys were ordered to join this group . Dov was certain the girls would be used as German field whores and the boys for homosexual activities with the German officers . He drew in a dozen deep breaths as his line inched forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't stand much of a chance of being sent through the left exit to the labor camp . In the next line a woman screamed and half a dozen guards convergedon her and flung her to the ground and ripped away her skirts . The woman had been trying to hide an infant . " Right . . . right . . . right . . . right . . . " the doctor kept ordering the victims . Dov Landau stopped before the desk . The doctor looked up and glanced at him . " Go to that exit on the right , " he said.  |p145Dov  smiled softly . " You are making a mistake , Doctor , " Dov said with infinite calm . " I am an expert forger and counterfeiter . Write your name down on that piece of paper and I 'll show you . " The doctor sat back , stunned . Dov 's coolness impressed him , for he obviously knew what awaited him . The youngster had put a sudden halt to the monotonous death march . The doctor caught his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed Dov and began to drag him away . " Wait ! " the doctor commanded . He Iooked at Dov again and orderedhim to turn around . For a second he became tired of the foolishness . The boy was making a clever bluff . He was about to order him out of the right exit , but his curiosity got the better of him . The doctor scribbled his name on a pad . Dov wrote out six duplications of the signature and returned the pad . " Which one of those did you write ? " Dov asked . Half a dozen guards peeked over the doctor 's shoulder and stared in amazement . The doctor looked at Dov again and then whispered to a guard who walked off . " Stand over here to one side , " the doctor snapped . Dov stood by the desk and watched the line of people move toward him . He looked at them being condemned at the rate of four a minute . Dov looked into the eyes of the guards and he looked at their truncheonsand at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistled a shaky tune half beneath his breath . Five minutes passed . Ten minutes passed . The line coming in from the platform seemed never to end . The guard returned with another man who was obviously a highrankingofficer , Dov thought , for his chest was filled with medals . The doctor handed the pad of signatures to the officer , who studied it for a full minute . " Where did you learn this ? " the officer snapped . " In the ghetto at Warsaw . " " What kind of work do you do ? " " Passports , travel cards , any kind of paper . I can duplicate any-thing . " " Follow me . " I ) ov passed through the left-hand door . As he got into the car and drove off toward Auschwitz a Main he seemed to remember Mundek 's words : " One of the Landaus must live through this . " In a few moentsthe car passed through the main gate of Auschwitz . The sign ver the entrance of the camp read : LABOR LIBERATES.  |p146The  main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was acre after acre of frame wooden barracks which were isolated from each other by high walls of electrified barbed wire . These acres of barracks fed manpower into some thirty subsidiary slave-labor camps . Each inmate wore a black and white striped uniform and an identification color on his arm and left breast . A pink badge was worn by homosexuals , a black badge by field whores , a green badge by criminals , violet badges for clergymen , red for Russians and Poles , and the traditional Star of David for the Jews . Dov received another badge at Auschwitz . It was a tattooed number on his left forearm . Dov Landau was now a black and white striped Jew number 359195 . LABOR LIBERATES . Dov Landau celebrated his fourteenth birthday in Auschwitz and his gift had been his life . He was quite fortunate for of all the tens of thousands of prisoners at Auschwitz , Dov 's small group of forgers were among the elite . His particular section was given the task of engraving and printing counterfeit United States one- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a short time at Auschwitz Dov wondered if it would not have been better to have died at Birkenau . Here the inmates were underfed , worked into living skeletons , and stacked on shelves for their five hours ' sleep a night . Disease ran wild . Prisoners were tortured , driven insane , beaten , and degraded , and every known atrocity conceived by man was committed . Here each morning found dozens of inmates who had hanged themselvesby their own belts or thrown themselves on the quick mercy of the electric wire . The flogging blocks were in constant use and naked buttocks were lashed in public at roll calls . Here the penal colony lived in single black cells and were fed only oversalted vegetables to induce unquenchable thirst . Here in Block X , Dr. Wirthe used women as guinea pigs and Dr. Schumann sterilized by castration and X ray and Clauberg removed ovaries and Dr. Dehring performed seventeen thousand " experiments " in surgery without anesthetic . This was Auschwitz and this was Dov Landau 's gift of life . LABORLIBERATES . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mundek had said . What did Mundek look like ? He could hardly remember . Or Ruth or Rebecca or his mother and father ? He could not remember his father at all . The memories grew hazier and hazier until he could rememberp147nothing but death and terror and he did not know that there was a life where death and terror did not exist . A year passed . The trains came in and but of Birkenau . The deaths at the labor camps around Auschwitz from torture and disease and hunger were nearly as appalling as those at Birkenau . Somehow he managed to cling to his sanity and that animal instinct to survive . Even in this blackest of pits there were some rays of hope . There was the prison orchestra . There was a flourishing underground and they had a radio receiver . Even here a man could find a way to get to a woman . SUMMER 1944There was a strange new stirring throughout Auschwitz . Dov could often look into the sky and see Russian bombers , and the secret radio began reporting German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the muck and torture . Each new Allied victory sent the Germanguards into a murderous frenzy until the prisoners almost dreaded word of German defeats . At Birkenau activity speeded up until the gas chambers were in operation almost around the clock . AUTUMN 1944The feeling now was that Germany was going to lose the war . They were being beaten on all fronts . But as they lost on the battlefield the appetite for extermination grew . Colonel Eichmann threw every possibleresource into finishing his mission of genocide . OCTOBER 1944The Sonderkommandos at Birkenau staged a wild uprising in which one of the crematoriums was blown up . Each day in new uprisings the onderkommandos snatched SS guards and their dogs and threw themto the crematoriums . At last every Sonderkommando was executed nd a call went out for a new group from Auschwitz . His back to the wall , Eichmann made a final gesture . Twenty thoundJews , the cream of Jewry , who had been under guaranteed pro -- ltion at the C ech camp of Theresienstadt , were ordered transferred Birkenau fot/extermination . The Jewish death toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million Poles , fifty thousand Germans , a bunredthousand Dutch , a hundred and fifty thousand French , fifty ousand Austrians and Czechs , fifty thousand Greeks , two hundred id fifty thousand Bulgarians , Italians , Yugoslays , and Rumanians , d another quarter of a million Hungarians.  |p148Each  day during the macabre race for total annihilation came a call for more and more Sonderkommandos . NOVEMBER 1944The counterfeit shop was abruptly closed down in Auschwitz and everyone was sent to Birkenau to work as Sonderkommandos . It was Dov 's new job to wait in the corridor of the gas chambers until a gassing was over . He and other Sonderkommandos stood by until the shrieks of agony and the frantic pounding on the iron doors stopped . They waited another fifteen minutes for the gas to clear . Then the doors of the gas chambers would be opened . Dov had to go to work with ropes and hooks to untangle the hideous tangle of arms and legs and drag them out for reshipment to the crematorium . After the bodies were removed he had to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for the next batch of victims who were already in the dressing rooms , being prepared . For three days Dov worked at this gory task . Every ounce of his strength was sapped , and now that stubborn , defiant will to live that had carried him through seemed to fade . He dreaded that instant when the iron chamber door opened and he was face to face with the tangle of corpses . He dreaded it worse than the thought of the ghetto or the sewers . He knew he would not be able to stand to see that horrible sight much more often . Then a startling thing happened ! The Germans ordered the crematorium ovens dismantled and the gas chambers blown up ! The Allies were advancing from the west and the Russians were coming from the east . Now the Nazis made frantic efforts to cover up their crimes . Pits of bodies were exhumed all over Poland and the bones crushed and scattered . Desperately needed transportation was used to get the Jews inside Germany . JANUARY 22 , 1945The Russian Army entered Auschwitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was over . Dov Landau , aged fifteen , wax ' one of fifty thousand Polish Jews who had kept alive out of three an a half million . He had kept his promise to his brother . The Russian army physicians who ex amined Dov were astonished that he had been able to live throughp149the years of privation and punishment without incurring permanent damage . He was weak and undersized and he would never have great stamina but with proper care he could be brought up to reasonable condition . The injury to his mind was something else . The boy had been kept alive by an indomitable spirit . Now that he could relax after six years of constant strain a flood of memories surged through his brain day and night . He became morose and slipped into melancholia and his mental state approached the thin borderline that separates the sane from the insane . The barbed wire was torn down and the chambers and the ovens were gone but the memories would never leave him . And the frightful smell seemed always to hang over him . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he relived that grotesque second when the doors of the gas chamber were flung open . Time and time and time again he saw his mother and his sister Ruth being removed from such a chamber at Treblinka . Time and time again he held that flickering candle close to the smoldering bodies in the bunker in the Warsaw ghetto and wondered which one was Mundek . Over and over again he law the skulls the Germans used as paperweights as his mother and is sister . The Jews remaining at Auschwitz huddled together in several barcks . Dov could not comprehend that there was a world of the livingthout depravity and torture . A world of food and warmth and love was beyond him . Even the news of the German surrender brought o scenes of joy at Auschwitz , for there was no joy in victory . Dov Landau 's memories festered into hate . He was sorry the gas hambers were gone for he could visualize lines and lines of German S troopers and their dogs being marched into them . ' I'he war was over but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' arsaw ? It was a hundred and sixty miles away and the roads were logged with . refugees . Even if he got to Warsaw , what then ? The hetto was rubble and his mother and father and sisters and Mundek cre all gone  --  all of them were dead . Day after day Dov sat by the ndow without speaking a word . He stared out at the eternal pall at clung to the Silesian countryside . One by one the Jews at Auschwitz ventured out to return to their noes . One by one they came back to Auschwitz with a final crushing sillusion . The Germans were gone but the Poles were carrying on r them . There were no cries of Poles for three and a half million iodered . Instead the cities were covered with posters and the peoplep150screamed , " The Jews brought this war on us . . . the war was started so that Jews could make a profit . . . the Jews are the cause of all our troubles ! " There were no tears for the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They smashed Jewish shops and beat up Jews who tried to return to their homes and property . And so  --  those who ventured out of Auschwitz came back . They sat in the muck-filled compounds , shattered , half mad , and tragically waited to rot together . The memory of death never left them . The smell from Birkenau was always there . SUMMER 1945A man walked into Auschwitz and was greeted with suspicious snarls . This man was in his early twenties . He was husky and had a big black mustache and wore a snow-white shirt with the sleeves rolled up above the elbows . He walked with a wonderful step that seemed to tell everyone that he was a free man . An assembly was called on the grounds and they gathered about him . " My name is Bar Dror , Shimshon Bar Dror , " he called out . " I have been sent from Palestine to take you people . . . home ! " For the first time in the memory of many there was an outburst of happiness and tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . Many fell on their knees and kissed his hands and others just wanted to touch him , to hear him , and to see him . A free Jew  --  from Palestine ! Shimshon Bar Dror  --  Samson , Son of Freedom had come to take them home ! Bar Dror took charge of the compound with a vengeance . He told them that it would be some time before they could move out , but until the Mossad Aliyah Bet found a way for them they would do better to live like dignified human beings . A new surge of life transformed the compound . Bar Dror organized committees to put the place into decent shape . School was started , a theatrical group organized , a small orchestra formed and dances held , a daily news bulletin printed , and endless discussion carried on about Palestine . Shimshon even started a model farm near the compound to begin agricultural training . Once the new spirit had been instilled and the camp was selfgoverning , Shimshon Bar Dror set out on treks in search of other Jews to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Mossad Aliyah Bet agents worked untiringly t4 gather the Jews together and get them out of Poland , another force was working just as hard to keep them in Poland.  |p151Throughout  Europe the British embassies and consulates put pressure on every government to keep their borders closed to these refugees . The British argued that it was all a plot of the world Zionists to force their own solution on the Palestine mandate . As the undercover battle raged between the British and the Mossad Aliyah Bet , the Polish government issued an astonishing edict ; it proclaimedthat all Jews were to remain in Poland . The Polish governmentreasoned that if the few remaining Jews were allowed to leave they would confirm to the world that the Poles were continuing their persecution  --  as indeed they were  --  even after the German exterminationprogram . Thus the Jews were locked in a country that did not want them and locked out of the country that did want them . Winter came to Auschwitz and morale broke apart at the seams . All the good work of Bar Dror went for nought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political battle that raged around them , but the survivors would not listen . They did not care about politics . In the dead of winter another Aliyah Bet man entered the camp , and he and Bar Dror made a gambling decision . The two men called the section leaders together and told them to prepare to abandon the camp . " We are going to head for the Czech border , " Bar Dror said . " It is not too long a journey but it will be difficult . We can only go as fast as the slowest man and we must stay off the main roads . " Barror opened a map and traced a route that would take them throughe Carpathian Mountains and the Jablunkov Pass , a distance of seventymiles . " What happens when we reach the border ? " someone asked . " We have Aliyah Bet men buying off the Polish border patrol . If can get through to Czechoslovakia we will be safe for the time ing . Jan Masaryk is a friend . He will not let them chase us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the night , striking off the main old  --  a tragic line of survivors streaming forth , with the strong holdupthe weak and carrying the young . The straggling procession shed over fields of snow , driving their beaten &; dies for six harrowingdays . Then they drove themselves up into the biting winds of the rpathian Mountains , with the Palestinians miraculously keeping em all alive and moving them on and on closer to the border . Along the frontier other Aliyah Bet men worked feverishly to spread be money among the Polish guards , and as the ragged caravanp152pressed to the boundary the guards , with their pockets stuffed , turned their backs and the Jews poured through into Czechoslovakia . On they marched through the freezing cold until they passed through the Jablunkov Pass and assembled at the bottom , exhausted , feet bleeding , hungry , and in need of medical attention . A special train had been chartered by the Mossad Aliyah Bet . The escapees were taken aboard to waiting warmth , food , and attention . The first leg of the perilous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he surrendered his passport to the Aliyah Bet so that it could be used again . Five hundred such passports were distributed to the escapees from Auschwitz . In addition to the passports the Aliyah Bet had collected visas for Venezuela , Ecuador , Paraguay , and other South American countries . These " documents " would hold the British at bay for a while . British CID got wind of the five hundred Jews who had crossed from Poland and relayed the news to the Foreign Office at Whitehall . Whitehall sent an urgent dispatch to the British ambassador in Prague to take the matter up with the Czech Foreign Minister , Masaryk , and have the train stopped . The British ambassador was granted an immediatemeeting with Masaryk and demanded that the Jews be returned to Poland . He pointed out that the entire Mossad operation was illegal , contrary to Polish law , and had been sponsored by the Zionists in an effort to force the issue over Palestine . Masaryk smiled , " I do not know much about oil pipelines , Mr. Ambassador , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masaryk was known to be outspoken in behalf of the Jews . The ambassador implied that British displeasure could be displayed in a more " practical " manner . " Mr. Ambassador , " Masaryk said , " I will not comply with this or any other British threat . So long as I am Foreign Minister of Czechoslovakiathe borders of my country are open to the Jews with or withoutvisas and with or without passports . " The ambassador reported to Whitehall that the train could not be stopped . It rolled on toward Bratislava , the town where the borders of Hungary , Czechoslovakia , and Austria came together . Again the British attempted to stop it , but this time it crossed into Austria under the personal protection of a sympathetic American militarycommander . In Vienna the travelers stopped for much-needed rest and medical attention . They were issued clothing in a giant restaging area thatp153had been established by American Jews to help the European survivors . In Italy , the next stop , the Mossad Aliyah Bet had the open cooperationof the public and the Italian officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was occupied by the British . Paradoxically some of the British occupation forces consisted of units of Palestinian Jews . The Palestine Brigade of the British Army and its units stationed all over occupied Italy had long been consideredmodel troops by the British command . Aliyah Bet agents from Palestine integrated with these units , and soon the Palestinian soldiers were busy establishing refugee camps , helping with illegal ships , and the like . For formal purposes the Palestine units were commanded by army officers , but for practical purposes the units were under the command of the Aliyah Bet and Palmach . Shimshon Bar Dror had been an army sergeant in one such unit and used his British army papers to travel back and forth to Poland to round up refugees . It was springtime when Dov 's group of Auschwitz refugees embarked on another train that moved into the Austrian Alps and crossed into Italy through the Brenner Pass . The train stopped near Lake Como outside Milan at a very isolatedsiding . Although the refugees had been warned that they would be met by men wearing British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprehend men in fighting uniform wearing a Star of David on their arm . The Star of David had always been the insignia of the ghetto . No Jews , except in the ghetto uprisings , had fought under a Star of David for nearly two thousand years . They debarked from the train apprehensively . The soldiers were kind and some spoke Yiddish and all spoke Hebrew and they were entle but they seem to be of a different breed of Jew . A week after their arrival in Milan , Dov 's group of a hundred people were taken from a small camp in the dead of night . They were transported in British trucks driven by members of the Palestine Brigade . The convoy dashed to a secret rendezvous , , point along the coast where it met another three hundred refugeeswho had assembledfrom other camps . From nearby La Spezia harbor a tiny vesseloved out to meet them . The ship dropped anchor offshore and was loaded by rubber boat . t sailed and got out of the three-mile limit and was soon trailed by c ever alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zion . Unlike all e other refugee ships , this one was not heading for Palestine . Itsp154course , instead , was toward the Gulf of Lions on the southern coast of France . Neither the British nor the refugees aboard the Gates of Zion had the slightest idea the vessel was a part of a gigantic plot . CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN : Bill Fry sat at a table at Miller Brothers ' Restaurant in Baltimore , Maryland . He dropped a handful of oysterette crackers into a big steaming bowl of clam chowder and stirred it . He toyed with the soup for a moment but he had no appetite . " Jesus Christ , " he thought . " I wonder if I can get that piss-pot across the Atlantic Ocean . " Bill Fry had earned a reputation as the most successful captain in the Mossad Aliyah Bet . His beaching of the Star of David at Caesarea had opened a new era in the illegal immigration war . It had forced the British to start the Cyprus detention camps . This had been a turningpoint , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as the British turned them back , and now another crisis was brewing . Mossad Aliyah Bet had run in so many illegals that the camp in Cyprus was bursting . Flushing with success and determined to break the British exclusion policy , the Mossad dreamed up a wild scheme and chose Bill Fry to execute it . The largest of the illegal fleet to date had been his Star of David , which carried under two thousand passengers . Other ships carried from a few hundred to a thousand . The Mossad figured that if they could run the blockade with a ship holding upwards of five thousand refugees it would be a staggering blow for the British . Bill was commissioned to find a ship that could do the job , outfit it , and take five thousand refugees from the big center at La Ciotat in southern France . It was felt that the ship should be purchased in tha United States or South America where the British would not be suspicious . British CID simply had the European ports too well covered . Mossad agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the east coast . It became obvious that they weren ' going to get much of a ship for the money they had to spend . So Bil had taken a gamble and now he was worried . He had purchased as overaged , obsolete steamship which had seen service only on the Chesapeake Bay in an overnight run between Baltimore and Norfolk The ship , the General Stonewall Jackson , an oversized pleasup155cruiser , had never sailed the ocean . The only thing Bill could think of that was decent about the ship was that it had been bought cheap . The white-coated waiter hovered over Bill 's table . " Is something wrong with the chowder , sir ? " " Huh ? Oh , hell no ... it 's fine , " he mumbled , and shoved a spoonfulinto his mouth . Had the purchase of the obsolete bay liner been a mistake ? At this moment it was being fitted in Newport News , Virginia , to hold 685o refugees . Bill sighed . There was the other side of the picture . Suppose he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It would just about explode the British policy ! Bill shoved the bowl of chowder away and asked for the check . He picked up the dead cigar butt from the ash tray and relit it and once again read the telegram from Newport News : THE JACKSON IS READY . At Newport News the next day Bill assembled his crew of PalestinianPalmach and Aliyah Bet , American Jews , sympathetic Spanish Loyalists , Italians , and French . He inspected the ship and ran a short shakedown cruise around the lower bay , then revved up her engines and made for the Atlantic Ocean . Within three hours the Jackson developed engine trouble and had to return to Newport News . During the next two weeks Bill made three more attempts . The moentthe old ship got far from her natural habitat , she rebelled and ad to be taken back to port . Bill told the Aliyah Bet people he had made a mistake . The Jackson mply could not make it . They urged him to check her over in dock r another week and make one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held its collective breath as e obsolete steamer chugged past Cape Henry into deep waters of e Atlantic  --  and continued to chug . Twenty-two days later the Stonewall Jackson wheezed up the t ulf Lions to the French harbor of Toulon , which stood forty miles m Marseilles and only twenty miles from the big refugee camp of Ciotat . There had been a teamster strike in France , and the British CIDo were watching La Ciotat relaxed for a moment , assuming thate would be no movement without trucks . Furthermore , there hadno reports of illegal ships coming from any European ports sincep156the Gates of Zion , Dov 's ship , had landed at Port-de-Bouc several weeks earlier . The British were caught napping . They had no advance notice of the Jackson because she had been purchased and fitted in the United States and to date no Aliyah Bet ship had been large enough to navigate the Atlantic . When the Jacksonwas due to arrive at Toulon the Aliyah Bet went to the head of the French Teamsters ' Union and explained the situation . The Teamsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of their strike they rushed in and out of La Ciotat transporting sixty-five hundred refugees to Toulon  --  among them Dov Landau . British CID discovered the secret at the last moment and descended upon Toulon . They passed out enormous bribes to port officials to delay the departure of the Jackson long enough for them to contact London for instructions . Mossad Aliyah Bet men made counterbribes to the officials to get the ship on the seas , and the Jackson , now renamed the Promised Land , ran the blue and white Star of David to her mast top in open challenge . Hasty meetings took place at the Admiralty , Chatham House , and Whitehall . The implications of the situation for British policy were clear , and it was obvious that the Promised Land had to be stopped at all costs . The British issued angry threats to the French . British warships waited outside Toulon . The French answered by granting permission to the Promised Land to sail . The Promised Land set out from Toulon mid the cheers of the refugees aboard her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by two waiting British cruisers , the Apex and Dunstonj Hill . For the next three and a half days Bill Fry steered the Promisee Land straight for Palestine . Her long thin smokestack puffed and 1 1 , , engines groaned and her decks bulged , and her watchdog cruise watched . The Apex and Dunston Hill kept in constant radio contact wit , the Admiralty in London . As the Promised Land edged to within fif miles of the Palestine coast , the British broke the rules of illegal bloc ade . The Apex came close to the steamer and sent a salvo over hancientbows . The cruiser 's bull horns blasted and her loud-speaksenta voice over the water : " Illegal ship ! Stand by to be boarded ! Bill Fry bit his cigar . He grabbed a megaphone and stepped ontp157the bridge . " We are on the high seas , " he shouted . " If you board us here it will be piracy ! " " Sorry , chaps , just following orders . Are you going to accept a boarding party peacefully ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Let 's give these bastards a reception . " The Promised Land turned on full steam in an attempt to sprint away from the cruisers . The Apex moved alongside her , then cut in sharply and her steel bow rammed the ancient steamer amidships . The blow splintered deep into the steamer 's hull over the water line and she shuddered under the impact . The Apex sent out machine-gun fire to drive the refugees off the deck and make it clear for a Ianding party . British marines , wearing gas masks and carrying small arms , poured over the bow of the Promised Land and moved back to the superstructure . Palmachniks unrolled accordions of barbed wire in the path of the British and then loosed a barrage of rocks on them , followed by streams of water from pressure hoses . The British were swept back to the bow by the attack . They fought off the Palmach with small arms and called for reinforcements . More marines boarded , this time with wire cutters . Another attack mounted toward the superstructure . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , under cover of machine-gun fire from the Apex . They reached the barbed wire and cut it in time to receive scalding steam jets from the Palmach . Now the Palmachniks jumped to the attack and drove the British back . They overpowered the marinesand threw them into the sea , one by one . The Apex stopped the attack to fish their men out of the water , and the Promised Land , a huge hole in her side , chugged off once again . The Dunstan Hill chased her down and pondered the advisability of another ram . The steamer might well go down with one more blow . It was too dangerous to risk . Instead , the Dunston Hill poured on heavy-caliber machine-gun fire that raked the decks clean of refugeesand Palmach . The Dunston Hill 's boarding party came up amidshipson ladders . A wild hand-to-hand brawl followed . With flailing clubs and an occasional pistol shot , the British pressed the attack toward the ladder leading up to the captain 's bridge . Meanwhile , the Apex recovered and raced to the scene again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party boarded again behind a tear-gas barrage , and with the Dunston Hill marines pressing from the other direction the Palmach was driven back . Dov Landau was in the fight . He and other refugees were guardingp158the top of the ladder near the captain 's bridge . They pushed the British down the ladder half a dozen times until the tear gas and , finally , small arms drove them off . The British had control of the deck now . They reinforced their positionand held the refugees and Palmach off at gunpoint while another party stormed into the wheelhouse to gain command of the ship . Bill Fry and five of his crew greeted the first three men who entered the wheelhouse with pistols and angry fists . Although he was completelycut off , Bill continued fighting until British marines dragged him from the wheelhouse and beat him unconscious with clubs . After four hours of fighting , with eight of their men dead and a score wounded , the British gained control of the Promised Land . Fifteen Jews were killed , among them the American captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Haifa harbor in Palestine as the Dunston Hill towed the Promised Land in . The old steamship was listing badly . The entire Haifa dock area was flooded with British troops . The Sixth Airborne Division was there and they were armed to the teeth . But in their attempt at maintaining the secrecy , the British did not know that the Jews had broadcast a full account of the boardingof the Promised Land over their radio . As the ships approached Haifa Bay , the Jews in Palestine called a general strike . Troops and tanks were required in the dock area to form a barrier between the refugees and Palestine 's angry Jews . Four British prison ships , Empire Monitor , Empire Renown , EmpireGuardian , and the Magna Charta waited to effect an immediate transfer of the refugees from the Promised Land . But the very instant the Chesapeake Bay liner was towed into port , the harbor area and the entire city of Haifa shook under the impact of a mighty blast ! The Empire Monitor was blown to pieces ! This act was accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine to the ship 's sides . The Promised Land docked and the transfer operation began at once . Most of the refugees had had the fight knocked out of them . They went quietly to delousing sheds where they were stripped , sprayed , searched for weapons , and moved quickly on to the three remainingprison ships . It was a tragic procession . Dov Landau and twenty-five others locked themselves into a hold , armed themselves with pipes , and defied the British to the very end . The hold was pumped full of tear gas ; and Dov was carried from the Promised Land by four soldiers , still struggling , cursing , and fighting . He was thrown into a barred cell on the Magna Charta.  |p159The  prison ships were packed even more tightly than the Promised Land had been , and that same night they sailed from Haifa with the two cruisers , Dunston Hill and Apex , as escort . If the refugees were sent on to Cyprus to the already crowded camps there , then the Jews would have won their point . Sixty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added to the ever-growing numbers waiting on Cyprus to go to Palestine . " The refugees from the so-called Promised Land on the Empire Guardian , the Empire Renown , and the Magna Charta are to be returned to their port of embarkation , Toulon , France . Henceforth any of her illegal blockade-runners that are caught will also be returned to t heir ports of origin . " The Palmachniks and Mossad Aliyah Bet people who were with the refugees on the three ships knew what they had to do . If they deharkedand returned to Toulon and if the British rode out the storm , t hen there would be no more illegal immigration . The order for secrecy went out in Toulon as the prison ships steamed into the Gulf of Lions and dropped anchor offshore . Simultaneously the Palmach chiefs on each of the prison ships handed the British captains a message ; each one was to the effect that " We will be taken ashore only by force . " The commander of the prison ships radioed to the Admiralty in London for instructions . Whitehall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breaking the Anglo-French alliance . They warned the French not to attempt to take sides with the Jews and to allow the British to carry out the debarkation by force . For four days messages and instructions flew between London and the prison ships and between Paris and London . Then the French governmenthanded the British its dramatic decision . " The government of France will not allow or be a party to the forcibleremoval of the refugees . If the refugees desire to return to France of their own free will , they are most welcome . " The French had taken a stand with the Jews , even at the risk of rupturing relations with the British . The refugees were exhilarated by the news . To a man , they renewed their vow to stay aboard the ships . The British , recovering from the shock , informed the refugees that they would either debark at Toulon or sit in the Gulf of Lions until they rotted . Aboard the Empire Guardian , Empire Renown , and Magna Charta , the Jews dug in . The Palmachniks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theater , and generally tried to keep thingsp160going . The French government kept up a daily stream of barges between the ships and Toulon to supply the refugees with good food and medical care . A dozen babies were born . At the end of a week , the refugees were holding fast . On shore newsmen were getting curious about the three ships and were irate over the curtain of silence . One night an Aliyah Bet man swam ashore from the Empire Guardian and gave out the full story to the French press . The story swept through France , Italy , Holland , and Denmark . Editorial insults were hurled at the British , in all four countries . London braced itself against the onslaught of public resentment from the continent . They had expected it . They had , in fact , prepared for everything except the doggedness of the refugees . Conditions on the prison ships were of the worst . The atmosphere was sweltering and there was a good deal of sickness . Nevertheless , the refugees refused to come ashore . The British crews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship , were beginning to get uneasy . At the end of the second week the Jews were still holding fast and the clamor in the press was reaching a crescendo . Three weeks passed . Four weeks passed . At last the story began to lose its impetus . Then , the first Jew came ashore without being forced . He was dead . The whole issue was reignited . The captains of the three ships reported that the refugees seemed more determined than ever and the pressure on Whitehall mounted hourly . If more corpses were brought ashore it would be very bad . The policy makers decided to take another tack . They asked that the refugees send in delegations to talk it all over . Their plan was to try to find a compromise that might let them out of the whole affair without losing face . From all three ships they received the same answerfrom the Palmach chiefs : " We will settle for nothing more nor less than Palestine . " The affair went into its sixth week . When the second corpse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to come ashore or suffer the consequences . It was not clear what those consequences were to be , but when the refugees again remained steadfastthe British had to take direct action : " The Empire Guardian and the Empire Renown will set sail from Toulon at once . The destination of these two ships will be Hamburg , Germany , in the British occupation zone . The inmates of these twop161ships will be removed peacefully or otherwise and be detained at Dachau until further notice . " As the two ships passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on the journey toward Germany , Mossad Aliyah Bet made feverish plans to load up two more ships with fifteen thousand refugees and make a run for Palestine . For as the Renown and Guardian landed on German soil , world opinion against the British reached a tidal peak . It was a somber victory for the Aliyah Bet . As a last face-saving gesture the British let the third prison ship , Magna Charta , discharge its refugees at Cyprus , where they were sent to Caraolos . Dov Landau was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dachau , but the boy was a study of hate . Dov Landau spent his seventeenthbirthday in yet another prison  --  Caraolos . He ushered in this birthday as he ushered in every day . He lay on his cot and stared at nothing and spent the day without uttering a word . He had not spoken to anyone since he had been dragged from the hold of the Promised Land . During the long weeks in Toulon harbor his hatred had grown . At Caraolos a dozen welfare people and doctors and teachers and Pa Imachniks tried to reach him and break through his wall of bitterness , but Dov trusted no one and wanted no one near him . By day he lay on his cot . By night he fought off sleep , for sleep alwaysbrought the recurring dream of that moment the doors of the as chambers opened at Auschwitz . For hours on end Dov would stare t the blue tattooed numbers on his left forearm : 359195 . Across the path from his tent there lived a girl , and she was theost beautiful girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be beautiful in the places he had been . She was in charge t many younger children and she always smiled when she saw him lid she did not seem angry and aloof toward him as everyone else id . She was Karen Hansen Clement . Karen saw Dov and made inquiries as to why he did not take part school and other activities . She was warned to keep away from him , r he was said to be an " incurable " and maybe even dangerous . Karen took this as a challenge . She knew Dov had been in Ausch-'tz , and her compassion seemed limitless . She had done amazing lugs with youngsters before , and although she knew it might be bet/ter to leave Dov alone her curiosity grew each time she went to her tent and looked over at his . One day Dov lay on his cot , staring , and the sweat poured fromhim for it was very hot . He felt someone 's presence and jumped upinstinctively and tensed at the sight of Karen standing near him . " I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leak andthe water trucks will be coming soon . " Dov stared and blinked his eyes nervously . " I said I wonder if I could borrow your water bucket . " Dov grunted . " What does that mean ? Yes or no ? Can you talk ? " They stood and looked at each other Iike a pair of gamecocks . For that instant Karen was sorry she had come . She took a deep breath . " My name is Karen , " she said . " I am your neighbor . " Dov still did not answer . He glared . " Well . . . may I use your bucket or not ? " " Did you come here to slobber over me ? " " I came here to borrow your bucket . You are certainly nothing to slobber over , " she snapped . He spun away and sat on the edge of his cot and chewed his fingernails . Her abruptness disarmed him completely . He pointed to his bucket on the floor and she picked it up . He glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is your name ? I 'd like to be able to call you something when I bring your bucket back . " He did not answer . " Well ? " " Dov ! " " Karen is mine . Perhaps you can call me that and we can say hello . At least till you learn to smile . " He turned very slowly but she was gone . He walked to the tent door and watched her moving toward the British water tanker which had just passed through the gate . She was beautiful . It was the first time in many months that an outside event had been able to penetrate Dov Landau 's absorption in himself . This Karen was completely different from the others who had come to see him . She was abrupt and snippy and afraid  --  yet there was a tenderness that radiated from her too . She did not gush over him or recite words she did n't feel . She was a prisoner at Caraolos but she did not complain or seem angry like all the others . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good morning , Dov , " Karen said . " Thank you for the use of your bucket . " He grumbled . " Oh yes , you are the one who growls instead of talking . I have a little boy like you in my kindergarten class . But he pretends he is a lion . " " Good morning ! " Dov shouted at the top of his lungs . Dov knew what time she got up in the morning . He knew when she went to the wash racks and when she came and went from her classes . Ile slipped into her tent one day and looked around for her bucket and examined it . It had no hole in it at all . He would lie on his cot all day and wait anxiously for the sound of her footsteps coming down the catwalk . He would sneak to the tent door and steal a glance in her direction . Often , Karen would glance at his tent , too , and their eyes would meet for a brief instant . Then Dov would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness . The days passed but they were different now . He was still silent and sullen but often his thoughts veered from death and hate and he could hear the children in the playground nearby and he could hear her voice speaking to them . It seemed strange to Dov . In all the time he was at Caraolos he had never heard the children playing until after he met her . One night Dov stood by the barbed wire and watched the searchlightssweep through the tents . He often stood and looked , for he still slid not want to sleep . On the playground the Palmach had built a campfire and there was singing and dancing . Once he used to sing and dance those songs at Redeemer meetings , but he did not want to hear them now . Mundek and Ruth and Rebecca had always been there . " Hello , Dov . " Ile whirled around and saw the dim outline of Karen standing near him . Her long hair blew in the breeze and she tightened a ragged shawl about her shoulders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She pressed closer and he turned his back . " You like me , do n't you ? You can talk to me . Why do n't you go to school and join onr gang ? " He shook his head . " Dov . . . " she whispered . IIe spun around and faced her , watery-eyed . " Poor Dov ! " he reamed . " Poor crazy Dov ! You 're just like all the rest of them ! You 1st talk prettier ! " Dov grabbed her and put his hands on her neckp164and tightened his fingers on her throat . " You leave me alone . . . you leave me alone . . . " Karen looked him straight in the eye . " Take your hands off my throat . . . this instant . " He dropped his hands . " I was only trying to scare you , " he said . " I was n't going to hurt you . " " Well , you did n't scare me , " she said , and walked off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or speak to him . He was seized with terrible restlessness . Dov was no longer able to spend the hours in sullen and morbid silence . He paced back and forth all day long . Why did he let the girl break into his thoughts ! He had his memories and he had been alone with them ! Now be could not think ! One evening Karen was on the playground when one of her childrenfell in a game and started to cry . She knelt beside him and put her arms about him and soothed away the boy 's tears . For some reason she looked up and saw Dov standing over her . " Hello , " he said very quickly , and walked away . Despite the continued warnings of many to leave him alone , Karen knew she had penetrated a great darkness . She knew the boy was desperateand trying to communicate and that his " hello " was his way of saying he was sorry . A few evenings later she found a drawing on her bed . She held it to the candlelight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child , and barbed wire was beyond her . She crossed the path to Dov 's tent and when he saw her he turned his back . " You are a very good artist , " Karen said . " I ought to be , " he snapped . " I got plenty of practice . George Washington and Lincoln are specialties of mine . " He sat on his cot uncomfortably and bit his lip . Karen sat beside him . He felt funny , for he had never been so close to a girl other than his sisters before . Her finger touched the blue tattoo on his left arm . " Auschwitz ? " " Why do you bother with me ? " " Did you ever think that I might like you ? " " Like me ? " " Uh-huh . You are very good-looking when you are n't sneering , which is quite seldom , I must admit , and you have a very nice voice when you are n't growling . " His lips trembled . " I . . . like ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You understand me . My brother Mundek used to understand me . " " How old are you ? " " Seventeen . " Dov sprang to his feet and whirled around . " I hate these goddam British . They 're no better than the Germans . " " Dov ! " His sudden explosion ended as quickly as it had started . Yet , it was a beginning . He had blown off steam . It was the first time in well over a year that he had spoken more than one or two words . Karen watched him shrink back into that strange dark world Dov wanted to see Karen often because she was tender and she could listen to him and understand . He would talk quietly for a while and then burst forth with an impulsive short tirade of hate and then Ile would withdraw into himself . Karen began to confide in him and tell him about how she was going to meet her father again in Palestine . Since she had left the Hansens she had always worked so long and hard with the youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed proud that she would tell him all these things , and it was strange but she rather enjoyed talking to him . And one day a great thing happened . Dov Landau smiled again . When they spoke together he wanted to talk about nice things to her . The way she spoke . . . about the Hansens . . . the Danes .. . the children she loved . . . about her hope of reunion with her father . . . made him want to be able to talk like that too . But he could remember nothing nice , and before the war , 1939 , was so long ago he could remember nothing about it at all . Karen was careful with subjects that Dov did not mention . She never asked about Auschwitz or the ghetto . After several weeks she came to him one day with a mission . " Dov , I have a favor to ask . " Immediately Dov turned suspicious . " The Mossad people know you were in Auschwitz and they have also found out that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a new man here from Palestine . Joab Yarkoni tells me he wants to talk to you . His name is Ari Ben Canaan . He needs passports and documents and could use your services . " " So that 's it ! That 's why you made friends ! So you could get me work . "  | " Oh , shut up , Dov . You do n't even believe that yourself . " " Well , " Dov grumbled , " if they want me so badly they can come and ask me themselves . " " How can anyone ask you anything when you wo n't even talk to them ? " " And why should I work for them ? " " Because they 're working for you . " " Hell they are . They 're working to save themselves . " " All right . Take your side of it . They are no worse than the Germans , and if you could make American dollars for them you can certainlymake passports for the Mossad . " " You 're always so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never asked a favor of you . What shall I tell them ? " " Tell them I might , but a lot of things have to be made clear . " Karen took his hand and smiled . " Why do n't you make them clear ? Ben Canaan is waiting for you . " " I 'll see him here . " Dov secretly liked Ari Ben Canaan . He was direct and to the point and let Dov know that if he did n't work he was going to be the last Jew out of Caraolos . But more , Dov liked that quality of leadership in the man  --  the same quality Mundek had had . He went to work in the Palmach headquarters in one of the schoolrooms . Still , to everyoneelse in Caraolos but Karen , Dov Landau was incorrigible . He spoke only in anger . She was always called upon to calm his sudden eruptions . She saw in him things that no other person saw  --  wonderful strength and pride . There were other things that she could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half weeks after Ben Canaan 's arrival on Cyprus , David Ben Ami gave Dov a list of three hundred names of children to be fixed on documents resembling British transfer orders . The three hundredwere supposed to be moved from Caraolos to the new compounds near Larnaca . Dov knew that this was the escape ! Neither his name nor the name of Karen was on the list of transferees . Dov told David that he wanted to speak to Ben Canaan , and it was then that he put his demands to Ari that he and Karen be included in the escape . And Ari agreed to his demands.  |p167The  final steps in Operation Gideonwere twenty-four hours away . Ari Ben Canaan called a meeting of his chiefs in the home of Mandria , their Cypriot compatriot . David Ben Ami gave Ari the transfer papers that Dov Landau had just completed . Ari looked them over and commented that the boy was a real artist . The papers could have fooled anyone . David reported that he had taken care of the hundred odds and ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orthodox children . Joab Yarkoni , the Moroccan , reported that all the trucks were in ready condition and could be moved from the 23rd Transportation camp to Caraolos in twenty minutes . He gave the elapsed times of trial runs from Caraolos to Kyrenia by several alternate routes . Zev Gilboa said that the three hundred and two children would be loaded on the lorries in a matter of minutes after the convoy arrivedat Caraolos . He would brief the children as to what was going to happen a few minutes before the trucks departed . Hank Schlosberg , the American skipper of the Exodus , said he would take the ship out of its Larnaca berth at dawn and steam up to Kyrenia and be there at least a full hour or two before the convoy was due to arrive . Mandria reported that he had a system of lookouts posted along the escape route who could notify the convoy of any unusual British activity . He also had watchmen on a half dozen alternate routes . Mandriasaid that he would wait , as ordered , in Famagusta in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would telephone Mark Parker in Kyrenia . Ari rose and looked over his lieutenants . They were nervous , all of them . Even the usually placid Yarkoni was looking at the floor . Ad did not congratulate them or wish them luck . There was time for congratulations . As for luck , they 'd make their own . " I did not want to make the escape for three more days until theBritish themselves began moving children from the children 's compound . Nevertheless we have received information that Major Alistairis suspicious of our activities . We even have reason to believe he hasne to London for instructions over Brigadier Sutherland 's head. erefore we must make our break at once . Our trucks arrive atp168Caraolos at nine o'clock . By ten o'clock I hope we have loaded the children and are passing your house here in Famagusta . The minute we turn off the Larnaca road we have two crucial hours . We have no reason to believe our convoy will be stopped . Our trucks are well known all over Cyprus . But . . . we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any further questions ? " David Ben Ami , the sentimentalist , could not let the occasion pass without proposing a toast . Ari tolerated the younger man 's frivolity . " Le chaim , " David said , raising his glass . " Le chaim , " the rest of them answered . " I have heard that le chaim from you boys often , " Mandria said . " What does it mean ? " " It means to life , ' David answered , " and to Jews that is no small request . " " To life , ' " Mandria repeated . " That is nice . " Ari walked up to Mandria and hugged him in the Palmach manner . " You have been a friend , " he said . " I must go meet Parker now . " Mandria stood there with tears streaming down his cheeks for he knew that this kind of affection was reserved for one of their own and to receive it from Ari Ben Canaan meant that he had been acceptedfully as one of them . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , met Markon the terrace of the King George Hotel . Mark was a bundle of nerves . Ari seated himself , refused a cigarette , and ordered a drink . " Well ? " Mark asked impatiently . " Tomorrow . We will be at Caraolos at nine . " " I thought you were going to wait until the British started cleaningout the children 's compound . " " It would have been better but we ca n't wait . A friend at CID tells us that Alistair is on to something . But relax , " Ari said . " It is almostover . The British still do n't know what they 're looking for . Now you understand everything . " Mark nodded . He would send a cable asking for an extension of his vacation . Bradbury in London would know by the signature , Mark , that Operation Gideon had been a success and would turn loose the story Mark had sent with a commercial pilot a week earlier . " Suppose I do n't get a phone call from Mandria at ten . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell off Cyprus unless you want to cover my hanging . " " That might be nice , " Mark said . He " finished his drink . " By the way , " Ari said , looking out to the water , " Kitty has n't beenp169in the camp since we were forced to put Karen on the Exodus list . " " That 's right . She 's with me at the Dome . " " How is she ? " " How in hell do you think sheds ? She 's miserable . She does n't want Karen to go on the Exodus . Do you blame her ? " " I do n't blame her but I feel sorry for her . " " That 's nice . I did n't know you felt sorry for anyone . " " I feel sorry that she has let her emotions get the best of her . " " I forgot . You do n't know anything about human emotions . " " You 're nervous , Mark . " Mark was angry at Ari 's placidness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told him that Karen was going on the ship . " What do you want ? Kitty has suffered more than one personhas a right to suffer . " " Suffered ? " Ari said . " I wonder if Kitty Fremont knows the mean- ing of the word . " " Damn you , Ben Canaan , damn you . What makes you think that Jews own a copyright on suffering ? " " Fortunately you 're not being paid to like me and I could n't care less . " " How could you ? You see , I like people with human weaknesses . " " I never have them during working hours . " Mark stood up to leave . Ari grabbed Mark 's arm in his powerful hand . For the first time Mark saw Ben Canaan shaken from his complacency . There was anger in Ari 's eyes . " What the hell do you think this is ? A tea party on the duchess 's lawn ? We 're butting heads with the British Empire tomorrow . " He released his grip on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At that instant Mark felt a tiny bit sorry for Ari . Perhaps he had a better way of disguising it but the pressure was beginning to tell on him too . A few hours later Mark had returned to the Dome Hotel in Kyrenia . I le knocked on Kitty 's door . She managed to greet him with a half smile , but it could not disguise her red-rimmed eyes . " Tomorrow . " Kitty froze an instant . " So soon ? " " They are afraid the British are on to something . " Kitty walked to the window and looked out at the pier and the island . It was a crystal-clear evening and she could even see the faint outline of the Turkish coast . " I 've been trying to get up enough toursgeto pack up and leave Cyprus . "  | " Look , " Mark said , " as soon as this blows over , you and I are going to head for the Riviera for a few weeks . " " To pick up the pieces ? I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt if the British will let me in after this . Kitty , I feel pretty rotten about dragging you into this thing . " " It is n't your fault , Mark . " " You read that line well but it 's not quite true . Are you going to get over this ? " " Yes , I think so . I should have known better . You tried to warn me . At least I knew all the time that I was on thin ice . You know , Mark , it 's funny , but we argued the night I met Ben Canaan . I told you there was something different about Jews . They are n't like us . " " They have an unlimited capacity for getting into trouble . It 's their favorite sport , " Mark said , spinning off the bed and rubbing his temples . " Well . . . one way or the other we might as well eat and I 'm hungry . " Kitty leaned against the doorframe as Mark splashed his face with cold water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " Mark . It 's going to be very dangerous on the Exodus , is n't it ? " He hesitated a moment . There was no use trying to fool her at this point . " It 's a floating bomb . " Kitty 's heart sank . " Tell me the truth . Can they get away with this ? " " They have a fair chance with that mechanical monster , Ari Ben Canaan , running the show . " The sun went down and it was night . Mark and Kitty sat wordlessly in her room . " No use sitting up all night , " he said at last . " Do n't go , " Kitty said ; " I 'll just stretch out over the covers . " She reached into the night stand and took out a couple of sleeping pills , turned off the light , and lay back . Mark sat by the window and watched the surf slap against the shore . Twenty minutes passed . He looked over at Kitty and saw she had fallen into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood over her for several moments , then covered her with a blanket and returned to the chair . At Caraolos , Dov and Karen sat on his cot , too excited to sleep . They spoke in whispers . They were the only ones among the childrenwho knew what the new day would bring.  |p71Karen  tried to calm Dov . He kept whispering what he was going to do when he got to Palestine . How he was going to join the terroristsand kill British soldiers . She hushed him up as only she could and finally induced him to lie down . As he closed his eyes Karen stood up and a strange sensation swept through her body . Odd and frightening . Dov meant more to her than she had realized until this moment . First it had been pity . Now Dov had a hold on her . She did not understand it . She wanted to be able to go and talk it over with Kitty . But Kitty was gone . " Karen ? " " I am here , Dov . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company HMJFC three men lay on their cots wide-eyed . Zev Gilboa dared think about springtime in Galilee for the first time in nearly a year . He thought of his wife and child and of the farm . His baby had been only a few months old when the Palmach sent Zev to Cyprus . Joab Yarkoni thought of his farm too . It was different from Zev 's , for it hugged the sea just a bit north of the Plain of Sharon . His farm was called Sdot Yam and it meant Fields of the Sea , for its main crop was fish . Yarkoni loved to walk for hours through the abandoned ruins of Caesarea and dig for antiquities , and he hoped that the Palmachmight let him return there for a while . He would go out on his trawler fishing and he would see his brother and sister again. . . and David Ben Ami thought of his beloved Jerusalem . He loved Jerusalem almost as much as he loved Ari 's sister Jordana . Now he would see them both again until they reassigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where his six brothers lived and the city rose out of stone . David propped on an elbow and reread the worn letter that Ari had brought him . Jordana ! Jordana ! His heart raced wildly . Jordana , my love ! The three men knew that their stay in Palestine might be brief because they belonged to the Palmach and Mossad and they might be needed anywhere in the world . But this night they thought of home . .. . Brigadier Bruce Sutherland had another of his nightmares . He ressed and went out of his house alone and walked through Famastain the depth of night . He walked along the old wall of Famagustaand stared into the old city with its hundreds of churches and cathedrals and ruins of castles and memories of past glory . He walked until he came to Othello 's Tower and he climbed it and looked down at the harbor . He was tired , very tired , and he wondered if there would ever be a night again in which he could close his eyes and fall into a peaceful sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of the night he continued to pore through reports and bits and scraps of information in an attempt to put together exactly what the Jews were up to at Caraolos . Mandria paced back and forth in the room where the Mossad and Palmach had held so many meetings . Yes , it had been only a few weeks since Ari Ben Canaan and David Ben Ami had stood on that balcony outside and watched a convoy of Jews being taken from their illegal runner , Door of Hope . Tomorrow he would stand on the balconyand another convoy would pass . This one would climax Ari Ben Canaan 's fantastic scheme . The imagination of the Greek Cypriots had been tremendously stirred by the daring of the Mossad . Those of them , like Mandria , who worked with the Jews , were beginning to think in terms of an underground movement of their own against British rule on Cyprus . One man slept soundly . Ari Ben Canaan slept like a well-fed baby without a care in the world . ' " A ray of light fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yawned . He had dropped off by the window with his feet propped on the sill . He was stiff and his mouth tasted foul from cigarettes and scotch . He glanced around and saw Kitty in a deep and quiet slumber on the bed . He pulled the window shade down and tiptoed from the room and shaved and spent several moments under an icy shower and he felt better . He dressed and returned to Kitty 's room and sat gently on the edge of her bed and stroked her hair softly . She stirred and opened her eyes slowly . She smiled when she saw Mark and stretched and purred . Then her expression changed to one of fear . At twenty minutes to nine , Ari Ben Canaan , dressed as Captain Caleb Moore , entered the lead jeep in the convoy of twelve trucksp173of the 23rd Transportation Company . Each truck had a Palmachnik dressed like a British soldier as driver . They sped out of their camp and twenty minutes later halted before the administration building at Caraolos , outside the barbed-wire compounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the commanding officer , whose acquaintance he had carefully made during the past three weeks . " Good morning , sir , " Ari said . " Good morning , Captain Moore . What brings you up here ? " " We received a special dispatch from headquarters , sir . It seems that they are getting the Larnaca camp ready faster than they expected . They want me to transfer some children today . " Ari lay the forged II papers on the officer 's desk . The CO thumbed through the sheets . " This is n't on the schedule of transfers , " he said . " We did n't expect to start moving the childrenfor three days . " Ill " That 's the Army for you , sir , " Ari said . The CO bit his lip and meditated and stared at Ari and looked through the transfer papers again . He reached for the phone . " Hello . Potter here . Captain Moore has orders to move three hundred childrenout of Compound 50 . Dispatch a detail to help get them moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the papers . He signed half a dozen other sheets authorizing entrance into the compound and removal of the childten . " Move them along , will you , Moore ? We have another load to be transferred in an hour and the roads could be clogged . " " Yes sir . " " Oh , uh . . . Moore . Many thanks , old man , for the whisky you sent up to the club . " " My pleasure , sir . " Ari gathered up the papers from the CO 's desk . The CO sighed . " Jews come and Jews go , " he said . " Yes sir , " Ari said . " They come ... and they go . " The breakfast table was set in front of the window in Mark 's room . e and Kitty nibbled at their food . Mark 's ash tray brimmed over . What time is it now ? " Kitty asked for the fifteenth time . " Almost nine-thirty . " " What would be happening ? " " If they 're running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . Look , " Mark said , pointing out to sea . Thep174salvage trawler Aphrodite/Exodus turned and moved slowly toward the harbor entrance . " Good Lord , " Kitty said , " is that the Exodus ? " " That 's her . " " My God , Mark . It looks like it 's ready to fall apart . " " It is . " " But how on earth are they going to get three hundred children on her ? " Mark lit another cigarette . He wanted to pace the room but he did not wish to show Kitty how frightened he was . . Nine-thirty . Nine-forty . The Exodus passed between the lighthouse and the castle , through the narrow opening of the two arms of the sea wall , and into the Kyrenia harbor . Nine-fifty . " Mark , please sit down . You 're making me nervous . " " We should be getting a call from Mandria soon . Any minute now . . any minute . " Ten o'clock . Five past ten . Six past ten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee I ordered ? Kitty , phone from your room , will you . Tell them to get that coffee up here . " A quarter past ten . The fresh pot of coffee arrived . Seventeen past ten . Mark 's jitters abated . He knew that if he did not hear from Mandria in the next ten minutes something had gone wrong . Ten-twenty . The phone rang ! Mark and Kitty looked at each other for an instant . Mark wiped the sweat from the palm of his hand , sucked in his breath , and lifted the receiver . " Hello . " " Mr. Parker ? " " Speaking . " " Just a moment , sir . We have a call for you from Famagusta . " " Hello . . . hello . . . hello . " " Parker ? " " Speaking . " " Mandria here . "  | " Yes ? " " They have just passed through .

" They stood on the quay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dockside . Mark led Kitty away . They crossed the harbor and climbed to the ramparts of the Virgin Castle . From here they could see both the harbor and far down the coastal toad where the convoy was due to pass . At eleven-fifteen Mark focused his field glasses on the coast road . e slowly scanned the road that hugged the shore and wove in and ut of the hills . The mountain pass was too far off to see . He froze ! Ic had sighted a tiny trail of dust and a line of trucks which appearedsmall as ants . He nudged Kitty and handed her the glasses . She cld them on the trucks as they wove in and out the snake-like turns and inched toward Kyrenia . " They are about half an hour away . " " They came down from the rampart , crossed the harbor once again , nd stood at the end of the quay , which was only five walking mintesfrom the Dome Hotel . As the convoy passed the hospital at thee of town Mark took Kitty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booth at the Dome , Mark put in an urgent call to BritishIntelligence in Famagusta . " I wish to speak to Major Alistair , " Mark said , disguising his voice by putting a handkerchief over the mouthpiece and speaking with a British accent . " Who is calling , please , and what do you wish to speak to Major Alistair about ? " " Look , old boy , " Mark said , " three hundred Jews have escaped from Caraolos . Now just do n't ask any damned fool questions and give me Alistair . " The phone on Major Alistair 's desk rang . " Alistair here , " he said in his whispery voice . " This is a friend , " Mark said . " I am advising you that several hundredJews have broken out of Caraolos and are boarding a ship in the Kyrenia harbor at this very moment . " Alistair clicked the receiver several times . " Hello ... hello .. . who is this ? I say . . . hello . " He closed his own phone and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of an escape of Jews . They are supposed to be boarding a ship at Kyrenia . Sound an alert , blue . Have the Kyrenia area commander investigate at once . If the report is true you 'd better advise naval units to move for that area . " Alistair put down the receiver and rushed down the hall toward Sutherland 's office . The convoy rolled to a stop on the quay . Ari Ben Canaan got out of the lead jeep and its driver drove it off . One by one the lorries rolled up to the Exodus . The youngsters responded automatically as a result of Zev 's training . They moved quickly and quietly from the truck to the ship . On board , Joab , David , and Hank Schlosberg , the captain , moved them into their places in the hold and on deck . The operation was effected calmly and wordlessly . Along the quay a few curious onlookers stood and gaped . A few British soldiers shrugged and scratched their heads . As quickly as each truck was unloaded it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned . As of that moment the 23rd TransportationCompany had fulfilled its purpose and was going out of existence . Joab left a note in his truck thanking the British for the use of their lorry . Ari boarded the Exodus and went up to the wheelhouse . One by one the lorries discharged the children . It took only twenty minutes to load the boat . Zev , David , Joab , and Hank Schlosberg reportedp177that the boarding had been completed . Ari gave the order to Hank and he cast off and started the engines . " Get to the children , " Ari said , " and tell them exactly what we are doing and what will be expected of them . Any child who feels he can not go through with it will advise me in the wheelhouse and he will be returned to Caraolos . Explain to them that their lives are in danger if they stay . There is to be no pressure from you or the children to induce others to remain who wish to go . " As the Palmachniks went down to brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an instant the entire Kyrenia area was alive with . the shriek of sirens ! Ari turned a pair of field glasses on the hills and coastal road and saw dozens of British lorries and jeeps converging on Kyrenia . He laughed out loud as he saw the trucks of the late 23rd TransportationCompany rushing up the hills to be abandoned . They were rushingaway from Kyrenia and passed the convoy of British soldiers coming in the opposite direction . Ari looked below him . The children on deck were calm . The British poured into the harbor area ! Lorry after lorry of soldiers erupted onto the quay . Several officers were pointing at the Exodus and shouting orders . Soldiers began racing along both arms of the sea wall and setting up machine guns and mortars at the narrow harbor opening so that if the Exodus were to try it could not get out to sea . More lorries poured into the area . The quay was roped off and curious spectators pushed back . Ari watched the British strength grow by the moment . Inside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed soldiers . A pair of torpedo boats stationed themselvesoutside the harbor . On the horizon Ari could see a trio of destroyersrushing to the scene . The sirens shrieked on ! The peaceful little town was turning into an armed camp ! Then tanks rumbled onto the quay and artillery replaced the machine guns and mortars guardingthe harbor entrance . Another blaze of sirens brought a car bearing Brigadier Sutherland , Caldwell , and Alistair onto the quay . Major Cooke , the area commanderof Kyrenia , reported to Sutherland . " That 's the ship out there , sir . It 's loaded with Jews all right . It ca n't possibly get away . " Sutherland studied the harbor . " You 've got enough here to fight a Panzer division , " he said ; " they must be insane on that boat . Get a public-address system hooked up right away . " " Yes , sir . "  | " If you asked me , we 'd blow them out of the water , " Caldwell said . " I did n't ask you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this area cordoned off . Organize a boarding party . Tear gas , small arms , in case they wo n't come back by themselves . Freddie , hop over to the Dome and inform headquarters I want a news blackout . " Alistair had remained quiet and was studying the tugboat . " What do you make of it , Alistair ? " " I do n't like it , sir , " he said . " They are n't pulling a daylight escape like this unless they have something else in mind . " " Come now , Alistair . You 're always looking for sinister plots . " Mark Parker pushed his way past the guards and approached the two officers . " What 's all the noise about ? " Mark asked Alistair . The instant Alistair saw Mark he knew his suspicion was correct . " Really , Parker , " Alistair said , " do be a good sport and tell us . You know , old man , you ought to brush up on your British accent the next time you telephone me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , Major . " Brigadier Sutherland was beginning to catch on . He looked from the tug to Parker and to Alistair and he knew that the Mossad Aliyah Bet had caught him unprepared . He flushed . Major Cooke , the Kyreniaarea commander , reported . " We 'll have boarding parties formed in ten minutes , sir . Two hundred men and we 'll commandeer some trawlers here to take them out . " Sutherland did not even hear him . " Where is the loud-speaker , damn it all ! " Ten minutes later Sutherland grabbed a microphone . A silence fell over the harbor . The boarding parties stood by to go out into the middle of the harbor after the Exodus . " Hello , out there ! This is Brigadier Bruce Sutherland , the cornmanderof Cyprus , speaking , " his voice shot out in a series of echoes . " Can you hear me out there ? " In the wheelhouse of the Exodus , Ari Ben Canaan opened his public-address system . " Hello , Sutherland , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , His Majesty 's Jewish Forces on Cyprus . You can find your lorries up at St. Hilarion . " Sutherland turned pale . Alistair 's mouth dropped open . " Hello , out there ! " Sutherland 's voice snapped angrily . " We are goingto give you ten minutes to return to dockside . If you do not we are going to send out a heavily armed boarding party and bring you back . " " Hello , Sutherland ! This is the Exodus speaking . We have threep179hundred and two children aboard this boat . Our engine rooms are loaded with dynamite . If one of your troops sets foot on this boat or if one round is fired from any of your guns we are going to blow ourselves up ! " At that instant Mark Parker 's story was being cabled from London to every corner of the world . Sutherland , Alistair , and the five hundred British soldiers on the quay stood speechless as a flag was run up on the mast of the Exodus . It was a British Union Jack and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle of the Exodus was on ! CHAPTER THIRTYEXCLUSIVE ! DAVID VERSUS GOLIATH : MODEL 1946 BY AMERICAN NEWS SYNDICATE CORRESPONDENT CLARK PARKERKYRENIA , CYPRUS : I am writing this story from Kyrenia . It is a tiny , jewel-like harbor on the northern coast of the British Crown Colony of Cyprus . Cyprus has been rich in the pageantry of history . The island is filled with reminders of its vaunted past , from the ruins of Salamis to the cathedrals of Famagusta and Nicosia to the many castles of Crusaderglory . But none of this colorful history can match for sheer naked drama the scene that is being played at this very moment in this quest , unknownresort town . For some months Cyprus has been a detention center for Jewish refugees who have tried to run the British blockade into Palestine . Today , three hundred children between the ages of ten and sevenenescaped the British camp at Caraolos in an as-yet-undetermined nner , and fled across the island to Kyrenia where a converted salgetug of about two hundred tons awaited them for a dash to alestine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extermination camps . The salvage tug , fittingly renamed thep180Exodus , was discovered by British Intelligence before it could get out of the harbor . With its three hundred refugees the ship is sitting at anchor in the center of the harbor , which measures a mere three hundred yards in diameter , and has defied all British efforts to have the children debarkand return to Caraolos . A spokesman for the Exodus has announced that the hold of the boat is filled with dynamite . The children have joined in a suicide pact and they will blow up the boat if the British attempt to board her . LONDONGeneral Sir Clarence Tevor-Browne dropped the copy of the newspaperon his desk . He lit a cigar and studied the reports . Mark Parker 's story was creating a sensation not only in Europe but in the United States . Tevor-Browne had a request for instructions from Sutherland , who refused to take the responsibility of issuing an order to board the Exodus . Tevor-Browne knew that part of the blame was his . He had chosen Bruce Sutherland for the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the letter from Alistair which had warned that something was going to happen unless Sutherland was replaced . Humphrey Crawford entered Tevor-Browne 's office . Crawford was a pasty-faced career man in the Middle East section of the Colonial Office , and served as liaison between the army and the policy makers at Whitehall and Chatham House . " Afternoon , Sir Clarence , " Crawfordsaid nervously . " It is time for our meeting with Bradshaw . " Tevor-Browne arose and gathered some papers together . " Must n't keep old Cecil Bradshaw waiting . " Cecil Bradshaw 's office was in the Institute of International Relationsat Chatham House . For thirty years he had been one of the top men in formulating British Middle East policy . At the end of World War I , Britain and France competed for influence in the Middle East . When the British got the Palestine mandate , Bradshaw had been one of those , with Winston Churchill , who had pushed for the creation of an Arab state out of half the mandate . The state they were instrumental in forming was Trans-Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn it into a British military base . British subsidies made possible the establishment of Britain 's Arab army , the " Arab Legion , " and the choosing of a kingp181tot Trans-Jordan . He was the Hashimite Arab Abdullah , mortal enemy of Saud of Saudi Arabia . At the end of World War II the Labour party swept into power with promises  --  among others  --  to help establish a Jewish homelandin Palestine and a refuge for the survivors in Europe . Cecil Bradshawled that strong faction in Chatham House which convinced the new Foreign Minister that these promises were charming but not very practical and that Britain 's interests lay with the Arabs . The Arabs ' ten million square miles were rich in oil and included a vital canal . General Sir Clarence Tevor-Browne and Humphrey Crawford were ushered into Cecil Bradshaw 's office . The latter , a fat man in his sixties , stood looking at the wall with his back to them , his pudgy hands clasped behind him . Humphrey Crawford sat down nervously on the edge of a seat . Tevor-Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigar . Bradshaw talked to the wall . " Congratulations , gentlemen , " he said in a voice filled with sarcasm and quivering with anger . " I see we made the news today . " He turned and patted his rotund stomach and smiled . " You expected to find me in a lather . No indeed , no indeed . Whitehall called this morning . As expected , the Minister has dumped this Exodus business into my lap . " Bradshaw sat behind his desk , glanced at the reports , and snatched off his thick horn-rimmed glasses with a quick gesture . " Tell me , Sir Clarence ... was your Intelligence staff dead or merely out for tennis ? And I believe you have a bit of explaining to do about Sutherland . He was your idea . " Tevor-Browne refused to be bullied . " I believe the establishment of camps on Cyprus was your idea . What is your explanation ? " " Gentlemen , " Crawford said quickly to avert a clash , " we are faced with a peculiar situation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity has carried into the American press . " Bradshaw laughed a wheezy laugh . His big apple cheeks reddened . " With all of Truman 's talk the Americans have only allowed ten thou-sandJewish refugees into the country since the end of the war . Certainly Truman is for Zionism . . . as long as Palestine is n't in Pennsylvania . Everyone talks idealistically but we are still the ones with a million Jews on our hands , a million Jews who could ruin our entire position in the Middle East . " Bradshaw replaced his glasses . " Star of David , Moses , Palmach , Gates of Zion , Door of Hope , and now the Exodus . The Zionists are very clever people . For twenty-five years they have made us the villains in Palestine . They write words into the mandate articles and the Balfour Declaration that were neverp182meant . They can argue a camel into thinking he is a mule . Good Lord . two hours with Chaim Weizmann and I 'm about ready to join the Zionists myself . " Cecil Bradshaw took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tevor-Browne . " " I resent the implications , Bradshaw . Perhaps I am one of a few hardheads who say the only way we are going to hold the Middle East is by building a powerful Jewish Palestine . I do n't speak of Jewishinterest but I speak of British interest . " Bradshaw interrupted . " Now let 's get to this Exodus affair . The implicationsare absolutely clear . We gave in on the Promised Land but this time we will not give in . This boat is in our waters and not in French waters . We will not go on board , we will not send them to Germany , we will not sink them . They will sit in Kyrenia until they rot . Rot  --  do you hear that , Tevor-Browne ?  --  rot . " His hand began to shake as he grew angrier . Tevor-Browne closed his eyes . " We can not fight this out on moral grounds . We have no cause to keep three hundred children who were raised in concentration camps from entering Palestine . Oil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no cause ! We made ourselves look ridiculous by sending the Promised Land refugees to Germany . " " I know your sympathies ! " " Gentlemen ! " Tevor-Browne stood up and leaned over Bradshaw 's desk . " There is only one way we can win this Exodus affair . The Jews have planned this whole incident to create propaganda . Turn the tables on them . Let the Exodus sail this minute . That is what they do n't want . " " Never ! " " Ca n't you see , sir , that we 're playing right into their hands ? " " That ship will not sail as long as I am in Chatham House ! " CHAPTER THIRTY-ONEMARK PARKER DOME HOTEL KYRENIA , CYPRUSSTORY GAINING MOMENTUM . KEEP THEM COMING . KEN BRADBURY , ANS LONDONp183KRYENIA , CYPRUS ( ANS ) , BY MARK PARKERIt is a ridiculous sight . One thousand armed soldiers , tanks , artillery , and a naval task force all looking helplessly out at an unarmed salvage tug . The battle of the Exodus ends week one in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . To date no one has boarded the illegal runner which has threatened to blow itself up , but from the quay it is only a few hundred yards distant and a pair of field glasses brings the boat an arm 's length away . The morale of the three hundred children on the Exodus seems to be phenomenal . They spent the week in the harbor alternately singingand catcalling to the British troops on the quay and sea wall . Mark 's reports went out daily , each new one adding new and interestingdetails . When Cecil Bradshaw made the decision to make a test case of the Exodus he knew there would be a barrage of adverse criticism . The French press staged its usual uproar , although this time the insults were so terrible that the likes of them had not been heard in the historyof the Anglo-French alliance . The story spread throughout Europe , and even the British press became split and questioned Whitehall 's wisdom in not letting the Exodus sail for Palestine . Bradshaw was a wise politician and he had weathered many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would blow over , he was sure . He sent a trio of friendly journalists to Kyrenia to counter Parker 's reports , and a half dozen experts worked full time to explain the British position . The British had a case and it was being presented well , but it was difficult to offset natural sentiment for a group of refugee children . If the Zionists are so sincere , why are they endangering the lives of three hundred innocent children ? The whole thing is a sinister and cold-blooded plot to create sympathy and becloud the real issues of the Palestine mandate . It is obvious we are dealing with fanatics . Ari Ben Canaan is a professional Zionist agitator with a record of years of illegal operations . Newspapermen from half a dozen countries landed at the Nicosia airport and demanded permission to enter the Kyrenia area . Several large magazines also sent in teams . The Dome Hotel began to look like a small political convention headquarters . In cafes in Paris the British were denounced.  |p184In  pubs in London the British were defended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debates . In New York bookies were laying four to one that the Exodus would not sail . At the end of the second week Ari granted Mark permission to board the ship . Mark picked what he believed to be the ripe moment and arranged it by preset signals . Since he was the first outsider to board the Exodus his next three reports were carried by every newspaperon the front page . EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH EXODUS SPOKESMAN ARI BEN CANAAN : KYRENIA , CYPRUS ( ANS ) . Today I became the first correspondent to interview Ari Ben Canaan , the spokesman for the children on the Exodus . I confronted Ben Canaan with the barrage of British reports maintaining that he was a professional Zionist troublemaker and with other Whitehall accusations . We spoke in the wheelhouse of the boat , the only place aboard not teeming with humanity . Today the children seem still to be in top spirits but are starting to show physical effects of their twoweeksiege . Ben Canaan , thirty , and a strapping six-footer with black hair and ice-blue eyes , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratitude to well-wishers around the world and assured me the children were holding up fine . In reply to my questions he answered , " I do n't care about the personal attacks on me . I wonder if the British added that I was a captain in their army during World War II . I admit I am a Zionist troublemaker and I will continue to be one until they keep their promises about Palestine . Whether my work is legal or not is a matter of opinion . " I pressed him about the British arguments and the importance of the Exodus . " We Jews are blamed for many things and we are used to it . In anything concerning the Palestine mandate that can not be explained logically and reasonably they drag out the old excuse that it is some sinister plot of Zionism . I am really amazed that they have n't blamed the Zionists for the trouble they are having in India . Fortunately for us , Gandhi is not Jewish . " Whitehall is using that tired whipping boy , the mysterious Zionists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Jews and Arabs , sellouts , double crosses , and betrayals in the mandate . The first promisethey broke was the Balf our Declaration of 1917 which promised ap185Jewish homeland , and they have been breaking promises ever since . The latest double cross has come from the Labour party , which , before the elections , promised to open the doors o f Palestine to survivors of Hitler 's regime . " I am astounded at Whitehall 's crocodile tears over our victimizing of children . Every child on the Exodus is a volunteer . Every child on the Exodus is an orphan because of Hitlerism . Nearly every child has lived in either German or British concentration camps for six years . " If Whitehall is so concerned about the welfare of these children then I challenge them to throw open the gates of Caraolos to inspectionof the newsmen . It is nothing more or less than a concentration camp . People are kept behind barbed wire at machine-gun point with insufficient food , water , and medical care . No charges have been brought against these people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitehall talks of our trying to bully them into an unjust solution of the mandate . There are a quarter of a million Jews in Europe who survived out of six million . " The British quota of Jews allowed into Palestine is seven hundred a month . Is this their just solution ' ? " Finally , I argue the right of the British in Palestine . Have they more right to be there than the survivors of Hitler ? Let me read you some-thing . " With that , Ben Canaan took a Bible from the desk of the wheelhouse , opened it to Ezekiel , and read : " Thus saith the Lord God ; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered , and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the nations , then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob wherein your fathers abode and they shall abide therein and even they and their children and their children'schildren forever . " Ari Ben Canaan put the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their claims further . I say the same thing to the Foreign Minister that a great man said to another oppressor three thousand years ago  --  LET MY PEOPLE GO . " The day after his " Let my people go " report Mark followed up with the inside story of Operation Gideon , including details of how British trucks had been used in the escape . British prestige hit a lowwatermark.  |p186On  Mark 's advice , Ari allowed other newsmen to board the Exodus and they clamored to be let into the Caraolos camp . Cecil Bradshaw had expected criticism , but he had not reckoned on the furor that had been created . Meeting followed meeting , as for that moment in time the eyes of the world focused on Kyrenia harbor . To allow the Exodus to sail would be completely disastrous now . General Sir Clarence Tevor-Browne flew secretly to Cyprus to take command and see whether something could be done . His plane landed in the small hours of the morning under security measures at the Nicosia airdrome . Major Alistair met him and they quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headquarters . " I wanted to speak to you , Alistair , before I took over from Sutherland . Of course I received your letter and you are free to speak . " " Well , sir , " Alistair said , " I would say that the strain has got Sutherlanddown . Something has happened to the man . Caldwell tells me he has one nightmare after another . He walks all night long , till dawn , and he spends most of his days reading the Bible . " " Damned shame , " Tevor-Browne said . " Bruce has been a corking good soldier . I trust what is said will never leave this car . We must protect the man . " " Of course , sir , " Alistair said . KYRENIA , CYPRUS ( AP ) EXCLUSIVEGeneral Sir Clarence Tevor-Browne of desert fame landed anonymouslyat Nicosia airdrome last night .

It could indicate a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Exodus and asked that Karen be sent to the wheelhouse . He was worried as he pushed his way over the crowded deck . The children were looking gaunt and they smelled bad from the lack of water to wash with . Ari was in the wheelhouse as placid as ever . Mark gave him cigarettesand a few bottles of brandy . " How 's it going out there ? " Ari asked . " Does n't look like any change in policy with Tevor-Browne in . The story is still tops all over . Bigger than I expected . Look , An , this thing has worked perfectly for you and me both . You 've done whatp187you started out to do , given the British a black eye . The word I got is that the British are not going to back down . " " What 's the point ? " " The point is you can top this whole thing off by making a humanitymove and taking the ship to dock . We 'll make a big story when the British march them back to Caraolos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did Kitty send you in with this ? " " Aw , cut it out , will you . Just look down there at those kids . They 're starting to come apart . " " They knew what they were in for . " " There 's another thing , Ari . I 'm afraid we 've hit the mark with this story . We 're on top now , but tomorrow Frank Sinatra may unload a left hook on some columnist in a night club and we 're off page one . " Karen entered the wheelhouse . " Hello , Mr. Parker , " she said softly . " Hello , honey . Here 's a letter from Kitty and a package . " She took the letter and gave Mark one for Kitty . She refused the package as she had refused all the other packages . " Christ , I have n't got the heart to tell Kitty she wo n't take the packagesfor herself . That girl is sick . Did you see the circles under her eyes ? You 're going to have real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We were speaking of maintaining public interest . Get one thing straight , Parker . We do n't go back to Caraolos . There are a quarter of a million Jews in Europe waiting for an answer and we are the only ones who can answer them . Starting tomorrow we will declare a hunger strike . Anyone who passes out will be placed on deck for the British to look at . " " You ghoul . . . you stinking ghoul , " Mark snarled . " Call me what you want , Parker . Do you think I like starving a bunch of orphans ? Give me something else to fight with . Give me something to shoot at those tanks and those destroyers ! All we 've got is our guts and what we believe in . We 've had the hell knocked out of us for two thousand years . This is one fight we 're going to win . "  |p188HUNGER  STRIKECALLED ON EXODUS ! Children vow starvation rather than return to Caraolos . After allowing the story to build up over a two-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offensive . It was no game of " wait and see " now ; the children were forcing a decision . A huge sign was tied to the sides of the Exodus with lettering in English , French , and Hebrew . The sign read : Hunger Strike/Hour #1Hunger Strike/Hour #15Two boys and a girl , aged ten , twelve , and fifteen , were brought on the forward deck of the Exodus and laid out , unconscious . Hunger Strike/Hour #2oTen children were stretched out on the forward deck . " For Christ 's sake , Kitty , stop pacing and sit down ! " " It 's over twenty hours now . How much longer is he going to let this go on ? I just have n't had the courage to go to the quay and look . Is Karen one of those children unconscious on deck ?

It 's stinking , it 's sun-baked , and it 's in the middle of a sea of fifty million sworn enemies . Yet they break their necks to get there . They call it the Land of Milk and Honey . . . they sing about water sprinklers and irrigation ditches . Two weeks ago I told Ari Ben Canaan that the Jews do n't have a patent on suffering but I 'm beginning to won/der . I swear I wonder .

" " In Palestine , " Ari snapped , " youngsters this same age are already fighters in Gadna . " " It is one thing to fight and it is another to starve to death . " " This is only another way of fighting , " Ari said . Joab Yarkoni had worked with Ari for many years and had served with him in World War II . " I have never gone against you , Ari . The minute one of these children dies this whole thing is liable to boomerangon us . " Ari looked over to Hank Schlosberg , the American captain . Hank shrugged .

When we were a nation two thousand years ago and when we rebelled against Roman and Greek rule we Jews established the tradition of fighting to the last man . We did this at Arbela and Jerusalem . We did this at Beitar and Herodium and Machaerus . At Masada we held out against the Romansfor four years and when they entered the fort they found us all dead .

Hunger Strike/Hour #45p191The Jews in Argentina began to fast in sympathy with the children aboard the Exodus . Hunger Strike/Hour #47It was getting dark as Kitty boarded the Exodus . The stench was overpowering . All over the deck , in the lifeboats , on the superstructure she saw the crush of humanity . Everyone was lying down and absolutelymotionless to conserve energy . " I want to see those children who have passed out , " she said . David led her to the bow of the ship where there were three rows of unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lantern close to the bodies as Kitty moved from one to the other , feelingtheir pulses and looking into the pupils of their eyes . Half a dozen times she thought she would faint as her heart pounded and she rolled over a child who looked like Karen . David led her around the packed deck , stepping over the prostrate bodies . The children stared listlessly at her with dazed eyes . Their hair was matted and dirt caked their faces . David led her down the steep ladder onto the hold . She nearly vomited as the stink enveloped her . In the half light she saw the ghastly sight of the children packed in shelves one atop the other . On the deck of the hold they lay piled against each other . She found Karen in a corner , enmeshed in a tangle of arms and legs . Dov was asleep next to her . They lay on a pile of rags and the deck was slimy beneath them . " Karen , " she whispered . " Karen , it 's me , Kitty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black circles beneath them and her lips were caked dry . She was too weak to sit up . " Kitty ? " " Yes , it 's me . " Karen held her arms open and Kitty held her tightly for many moments . " Do n't leave , Kitty . I 'm so frightened . " " I 'll be near , " Kitty whispered , releasing the girl . She went to the hospital and examined the limited supply of drugs nd sighed despondently . " There is very little that can be done , " she id to David . " I 'll try to make them as comfortable as possible . Can m and Joab work with me ? " " Of course . " " Some of those unconscious are in serious condition . We 'll have to to sponge them to get their fevers down . It is chilly up on deck.  |p192We  'll keep them covered . Then I want everyone who is capable of working to get this ship clean . " Kitty labored feverishly for hours to ward off death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as one child was brought under control three more became seriously ill . She had n't the drugs , water , or other facilities to do very much . Food , the one weapon , could not be used . Hunger Strike/Hour #8 . Seventy children in coma lay on the deck of the Exodus . On the quay of Kyrenia harbor there were angry grumbles of insubordinationfrom the British ranks . Many of the soldiers could stand it no longer and asked to be removed , even at the risk of courtmartial . The eyes of Cyprus fastened on Kyrenia . Hunger Strike/Hour #8zKaren Hansen Clement was carried to the bow of the ship , unconscious . Hunger Strike/Hour #83Kitty walked into the wheelhouse and slumped exhausted into a chair . She had worked for thirty-five straight hours and her mind was muddled and dazed . Ari poured her a stiff brandy . " Go on and drink , " he said . " You are n't on strike . " She swallowed it down , and a second drink brought her to her senses . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a powerfulman . He showed almost no effects of the siege . She looked into his cold eyes and wondered what thoughts , what plots , what tricks were running through his brain . She wondered if he was frightened or even knew fear . She wondered if he was sad or shaken . " I was expecting you to come up here to see me much sooner , " he said . " I wo n't beg you , Ari Ben Canaan . Ben Canaan and God . . . in that order . . . is n't that right ? Well , there are a dozen children on the verge of death . I am merely reporting to you like a good Palmachnik . They 're going to die , Mr. Ben Canaan . How do you rule ? " " I 've been insulted before , Kitty . It does n't bother me . Is this humanityof yours so great that it cries out for all these children or does it appeal for the life of one child ? " " You have no right to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one girl . I am begging for the lives of a quarter of a million people . " She rose . " I had better get back to work . Ari , you knew why I wanted to come on board the Exodus . Why did you let me ?

" Maybe I wanted to see you. , , Hunger Strike/Hour #85General Sir Clarence Tevor-Browne paced up and down Sutherland'soffice . The smoke from his cigar clouded the room . He stopped several times and looked out the window in the direction of Kyrenia . Sutherland tapped out his pipe and studied the array of sandwiches on the tray on the coffee table . " Wo n't you sit down , Sir Clarence , and have a bite to eat and a spot of tea ? " Tevor-Browne looked at his wrist watch and sighed . He seated himself and picked up a sandwich , stared at it , nibbled , then threw it down . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is a bad business to be in for a man with a conscience , " Sutherlandsaid .

Tevor-Browne poured some tea and sighed , half embarrassed . " See here , Bruce . If it were up to me ... " " Nonsense , Sir Clarence . Do n't feel badly . It is I who feel badly . I let you down .

He was pale and his hand shook as he gave Tevor-Browne a note to read . Tevor-Browne read it and reread it and could not believe his eyes . " Great God , save us all , " he whispered . He passed the note to Bruce Sutherland . URGENTAri Ben Canaan , spokesman for the Exodus , announced that beginningat noon tomorrow ten volunteers a day will commit suicide on the bridge of the ship in full view of the British garrison . This protest practice will continue until either the Exodus is permitted to sail for Palestine or everyone aboard is dead . Bradshaw , with Humphrey Crawford and half a dozen aides , sped out of London to the quiet of a peaceful , isolated little house in the country . He had fourteen hours to act before the suicides on the Exodusbegan . He had badly miscalculated the entire thing . First , the tenacity and determination of the children on the ship . Second , the powerful propagandathe incident created . Finally , he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue as he had . Bradshawwas a stubborn man but he knew when he was defeated , and he now turned his efforts to making a face-saving settlement . Bradshaw had Crawford and his aides cable or phone a dozen ofp195the top Jewish leaders in England , Palestine , and the United States to ask them to_the intervene . The Palestinians , in particular , might possibly dissuade Ben Canaan . At the very least they could stall the action long enough to enable Bradshaw to come up with some alternate plans . If he could get Ben Canaan to agree to negotiate then he could talk the Exodus to death . Within six hours , Bradshaw had his answers from the Jewish leaders . They answered uniformly : WE WILL NOT INTERCEDE . Next Bradshaw contacted Tevor-Browne on Cyprus . He instructed the general to inform the Exodus that the British were working out a compromise and to delay the deadline for twenty-four hours . Tevor-Browne carried out these instructions and relayed Ben Canaan'sanswer back to England . URGENTBen Canaan informed us there is nothing to discuss . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He further states that complete amnesty to the Palestinians aboard is part of the conditions . Ben Canaansummarized : Let my people go . Tevor-BrowneCecil Bradshaw could not sleep . He paced back and forth , back and forth . It was just a little over six hours before the children on the Exodus would begin committing suicide . He had only three hours left in which to make a decision to hand to the Cabinet . No compromise could be reached . Was he fighting a madman ? Or was this Ari Ben Canaan a shrewd and heartless schemer who had deftly led him deeper and deeper into a trap ? LET MY PEOPLE CO ! Bradshaw walked to his desk and flicked on the lamp . URGENTAri Ben Canaan , spokesman for the Exodus , announced that beginningat noon tomorrow ten volunteers a day will commit suicide .. Suicide . . . suicide . . . suicide .. . Bradshaw 's hand shook so violently he dropped the paper . Also on his desk were a dozen communiques from various Europeanand American governments . In that polite language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He alsop196had notes from each of the Arab governments expressing the view that if the Exodus were permitted to sail for Palestine it would be consideredan affront to every Arab . Cecil Bradshaw was confused now . The past few days had been a living hell . How had it all begun ? Thirty years of formulating Middle Eastern policy and now he was in his worst trouble over an unarmed salvage tug . What queer trick of fate had given him the mantle of an oppressor ? Nobody could possibly accuse him of being anti-Jewish . Secretly Bradshaw admired the Jews in Palestine and understood the meaning of their return . He enjoyed the hours he had spent arguing with Zionistsaround conference tables , bucking their brilliant debaters . Cecil Bradshaw believed from the bottom of his heart that England 's interestlay with the Arabs . Yet the Mandate had grown to over half a million Jews . And the Arabs were adamant that the British were fosteringa Jewish nation in their midst . During all the years of work he had been realistic with himself . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck of the Exodus . Bradshaw knew his Bible as well as any wellbrought-upEnglishman and like most Englishmen had a tremendous sense of honor although he was not deeply religious . Could it be that the Exodus was driven by mystic forces ? No , he was a practical diplomatand he did not believe in the supernatural . Yet  --  he had an army and a navy and the power to squash the Exodusand all the other illegal runners  --  but he could not bring himself to do it . The Pharaoh of Egypt had had might on his side tool Sweat ran down Bradshaw 's face . It was all nonsense ! He was tired and the pressurehad been too great . What foolishness ! LET MY PEOPLE GO ! Bradshaw walked to the library and found a Bible and in near panic began to read through the pages of Exodus and about the Ten Plagues that God sent down on the land of Egypt . Was he Pharaoh ? Would a curse rain down on Britain ? He went back to his room and tried to rest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . let my people go . . . let my people go ... " Crawford ! " he yelled . " Crawford ! " Crawford ran in , tying his robe . " You called ? " " Crawford . Get through to Tevor-Browne on Cyprus at once . Tell him . . . tell him to let the Exodus sail for Palestine . "  |p197The  battle of the Exodus was over ! Within seconds , the words " Exodus to sail " were on the wires . Within minutes they blazed in headlines around the world . On Cyprus the joy of the people was boundless and around the world there was one long sigh of relief . On the Exodus the children were too exhausted to celebrate . The British urged Ari Ben Canaan to bring the salvage tug to docksideso that the children could be given medical care and the ship restocked and inspected . Ben Canaan agreed , and as the Exodus pulled in , Kyrenia turned into a mad scramble of activity . A score of British army doctors swarmed onto the ship and quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was established at the Dome Hotel . Rations and clothing and supplies poured onto the dock . In addition , hundreds of gifts from the people of Cyprus delugedthe ship . Royal engineers combed the ancient tug from stem to stern to patch leaks , overhaul the motor , and refit her . Sanitation teams made her spotless . After an initial survey Ari was advised it would take several days to get the children strong enough and the ship fit enough to make the day and a half run to Palestine . The small Jewish community on Cyprus sent a delegation to Ari to appeal to him to allow the children to celebrate the first night of Chanukah , the Festival of Lights , on Cyprus before sailing ; the holiday was to begin in a few days . Ari agreed . Only after Kitty had been assured and reassured that Karen 's conditionwas not serious did she allow herself the luxury of a steaming hot tub , a thick steak , a half pint of Scotch , and a magnificent , deep , seventeen-hour sleep . Kitty awoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ todecide either to end the episode with Karen forever or to follow the girl to Palestine . Late in the evening when Mark came into her room for tea she appeared none the worse for her ordeal . In fact , the long sleep had made her look quite attractive . " Newsroom still hectic ? " " Matter of fact , no , " Mark answered . " The captains and the kings are departing . The Exodus is day-old news now . . . the kind they wrap fish in . Oh , I suppose we can drum up a final page-one picture when the boat lands in Haifa . " " People are fickle . " " No , not really , Kitty . The world just has a habit of moving on . " She sipped her tea and sank into silence . Mark lit a cigarette and propped his feet on the window sill . He pretended his fingers were a pistol and pointed over his shoe tops out at the pier . " What about you , Mark ? " " Me ? Old Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domains . I 'm going Stateside and then maybe take a crack at the Asian beat . I 've had an itch to go there anyhow . . . I hear it runs crosswise . " " The British wo n't let you into Palestine ? " " Not a chance . I am held in very low esteem . In fact if they were n't proper Englishmen I 'd say they hate my guts . Frankly , I do n't blame them . " " Give me a cigarette . " Mark lit one and handed it to her . He bided his time , continuing to take target practice with his imaginary pistol . " Damn you , Mark ! I hate that smug way you have of reading my mind . " " You 've been a busy little girl . You went to the British authorities to ask permission to enter Palestine . Being the gentlemen they are , they opened the door for you and bowed . You were just a clean-cut American girl doing her duty . Of course , CID does n't know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . are you going or not ? " " God , I do n't know . " " You mean you have n't talked yourself into it yet . " " I mean I do n't know . " " So which side do you want me to take ? " " You could stop acting like a worldly Buddha looking down on the poor tormented mortals . And you could stop sniping at me , Mark . "  |p201Mark  dropped his feet from the window sill . " Go on . . . go to Palestine . That 's what you want to hear , is n't it ? " " I still do n't feel right around Jewish people . . . I ca n't help it . " " You feel fine around that girl though , do n't you ? Does she still remind you of your daughter ? " " Not really , not any more . She is too much of herself to be anyone else . But I love her and want her , if that 's what you mean . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " Go on . " " Are you in love with Ari Ben Canaan ? " Love Ari Ben Canaan ? She knew that he affected her whenever he was near or spoke or looked at her or even when she thought of him . She knew she had never met another man exactly like him . She knew she had a certain fear of his dark quietness and his tremendous power . She knew she admired his daring and courage . She knew there were moments she loathed him as she had never loathed another human being . But love . . . ? " I do n't know , " she murmured . " As much as I can not walk into it ... I ca n't seem to be able to walk away Kitty spent over an hour with Karen in the hospital ward that had been set up on the second floor of the hotel . Karen had made a remarkable recovery . In fact , the doctors were amazed with the near magic effect the two words " Eretz Israel " had on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Kitty sat with Karen she looked out over the faces of the children in the ward . Who were they ? Where did they come from ? Where were they going ? What strange , strange people . . . what a strange , strange obsession they carried . There were long periods of silence between Kitty and Karen in which neither of them dared broach the subject of her coming on to Palestine . At last Karen fell asleep . Kitty stared down at the girl . How lovely she was . . . how very lovely . She kissed Karen 's forehead and stroked her hair and Karen smiled in her sleep . She walked out to the corridor where Dov Landau was pacing back and forth . They both halted , stared at each other , and Kitty passed on wordlessly . The sun was setting as Kitty walked out to the quay . Across the street Zev Gilboa and Joab Yarkoni were supervising the loading of materials aboard the salvage tug . She looked about quickly to catch a glimpse of Ari . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they called to her . " Hi ! " she called back . She walked on down the quay toward the lighthouse . It was gettingchilly . She put on her sweater . " I must know . . . I must know ... I must . . . I must " she repeated over and over to herself . Out on the edge of the sea wall sat young David Ben Ami . He seemed lost in thought , looking out over the water and flipping pebbles . She came up alongside him and he looked up and smiled . " Shalom , Kitty . You look rested . " She sat beside him . For several moments they admired the sea . " Thinking of home ? " she asked . " Yes . " " Jordana . . . that 's her name , is n't it . . . Ari 's sister ? " David nodded . " Will you see her ? " " If I am lucky we will have a little time . " " David . " " Yes . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will take good care of them . They are our future . " " Is there danger ? " " Yes , there is great danger . " Kitty was quiet again for many moments . . . " Are you sailing with us ? " David asked . She felt her heart skip a beat . " Why do you ask ? " " It is beginning to seem natural to have you around . Besides , Ari mentioned something or other about it . " " If . . . if Ari is interested then why does n't he ask ? " David laughed . " Ari does n't ask for anything . " " David , " she said abruptly , " you must help me . I am terribly puzzled . You seem to be the only one who understands a little ... " " I will help you if I can . " " .. . I have n't been around many Jews in my life . You people bewilderme . " " We bewilder ourselves even more , " David said . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outsider . . . " " That is not at all strange , Kitty . Most people do . Even those few we call " friend , " even though they have a loyalty bordering on fanaticism . Some , I believe , feel guilty for all the crimes committed against us . Others want to be Jews . . . although Lord only knows why . We are a confusing lot . "  | " But a man like Ari Ben Canaan . Who is he ? Who is he really ? Is he a real person ? " " Ari is quite real . He is the product of a historic abortion . " They began walking toward the hotel , for it was suppertime . " It is difficult to know where to begin , " David said . " I suppose to really tell the story of Ari Ben Canaan we must start with Simon Rabinsky in the Jewish Pale . The Pale was an area in southwest Russia that included the Ukraine . I suppose we 'd have to start before the turn of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 1884 . " CHAPTER TWOZHITOMIR , RUSSIA , 1884Simon Rabinsky was a bootmaker . His wife 's name was Rachel . She was a good and a devout woman . Simon had two sons who were his greatest treasures . Yakov , the younger , was fourteen years of age . He was a fiery lad with a whiplash tongue and a quick mind . He would argue at the slightest provocation . Jossi , the older of the brothers , was sixteen . Jossi 's appearance was distinctive . He was a powerful giant who stood over six feet tall and had a head of flaming red hair like his mother , Rachel . Jossi was as mild as Yakov was wild . Jossi was quiet and meditative and gentle ; in fact , Yakov 's fertile brain in Jossi 's powerful body could well have created a superman . The Rabinsky family was extremely poor . They lived in that part of western Russia which included Bessarabia , the Ukraine , the Crimea , and parts of White Russia and which was known as the Jewish Pale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1804 as the only place in Russia where Jews could reside . It was , in fact , one enormous ghetto , with Moscow and Petrograd off limits except to those few wealthy Jews who could bribe their way into sending a son or a daughter beyond the boundaries . Establishment of the Jewish Pale was merely one event in a long history of discrimination . Jews first settled in Russia in the Crimea area as far back as the first century . The Khazars who ruled in that area were so taken with Judaism that they adopted it as their own religion . The Khazars ' kingdom was , in fact , a Jewish state . By thep204tenth century the Russians in the north had ascended to power and they swept down on the Khazars , dispersed them to oblivion , and began a sordid record against the Jews . As Russia came to power , the flaming sword of Islam came up from the south . During those periods when the Moslems held parts of Russiathe Jews knew their greatest times of peace and prosperity , for Jews had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the final defeat of the Moslems , full power over all Russia went to the Czars and to the Greek Church . Jewish " heretics " were burned at the stake by the hundreds during the Middle Ages . The ignorant peasantry was well instructed in the fable that these Jews were magicians and witches and used Christian blood in their rituals . Centuries of unrelieved abuse reached a climax during the reign of Catherine I. A series of pogroms  --  anti-Jewish riots  --  was unloosed against those who would not accept the Greek Orthodox religion . But attempts to convert the Jews failed utterly , so Catherine I expelled a million Jews from Russia . Most of them went to Poland . After this came the era of war and conquest in which Poland was conquered and reconquered , partitioned and repartitioned . Catherine II inherited a million of the Jews who had previously been expelled by Catherine I.These events led directly to the establishment of the Jewish Pale . In 1827 Jews were driven ruthlessly from the smaller villages into the already overcrowded Jewish quarters in the larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quota of Jewish youths to be turned over each year to the army for twenty-five years of military service . Simon Rabinsky , the bootmaker of Zhitomir , his good wife . Rachel , and his sons Yakov and Jossi were prisoners of the Pale and of a unique way of life . There was no social and very little commercial contact between these Jewish communities and the rest of the Russian people . The only regular visitor from the outside was the tax collector who might make off with anything from sacred candlesticks to beds and pillows and shoes . Frequent but less regular callers from the outsidewere the wild mobs of Cossacks and peasants and students who screamed for Jewish blood . Divorced from the greater society , the Jews had little or no loyalty for " Mother Russia . " Their spoken and written language was not Russianbut Yiddish , which was a bastard German . Their language of prayer was ancient Hebrew . The Jews even dressed differently . Theyp205wore black hats and long gabardine coats . Although it was forbidden by law , many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Russians to catch a Jew and cut off his curls . Simon Rabinsky lived the way his father and his father 's father had been forced to live inside ghetto walls . Because they were so poor there was endless haggling over a few kopeks . Yet , despite the desperatenessof their daily existence , Simon and all other Jews adhered to rigid codes of business ethics inside the ghetto . No man was allowed to infringe on the livelihood of his neighbor or to cheat or to rob . Community life pivoted around the Holy Laws , the synagogue , and the rabbi , who was at once teacher , spiritual leader , judge , and administratorof the community . The rabbis of the Pale were all great scholars . Their wisdom was far-reaching and their authority rarely questioned . Within the ghetto the Jews organized their own government under the over-all leadership of the rabbis . There were a hundred different lay offices and wardenships . There was a score of Biblical and Talmudicsocieties . There was an organization for the care of orphans and a society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were societiesto care for the sick , the aged , and the lame . There were administratorsof marriage contracts and an elected synagogue summoner , as well as a dozen other synagogue posts . There was an ecclesiastical court , there were psalm readers , and administrators over the ritual baths . Indeed , the community moved as one for the existence of all . The poor donated to the poorer . The poorer  --  to the poorer yet . Charity was the eleventh , the unwritten commandment . Leading scholars and religious leaders had to be cared for . Nothing was allowed to interfere with the pursuit of wisdom . Many people said that Simon Rabinsky , the bootmaker , was secondin wisdom only to the rabbi himself . In the Pale where nearly everyone was destitute the measure of a man 's wealth was his knowledge . Simon served as a deacon of his synagogue . Each year he was elected to one or two other high offices in the community . It was Simon 's dream to fill his sons with the wonders of the conquest of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They claimed it was so vast that one could read it and study it for a lifetime without ever looking at another book and never swim from one side of the " sea " to the other . The Rabinsky brothers studied this great collection of laws and customs , which contained information on everything from social behaviorto personal cleanliness.  |p206In  addition to studying the Talmud the Rabinsky brothers spent hours learning the Pentateuch , the first five books of Moses which make up the Torah and were considered the holiest of all works . They learned the Bible . They learned the oral laws of the Mishnah . They learned the folk legends , wise sayings , and commentary on the Bible of the Midrash . They learned the Cabala , the book of mystics , and they learned the prayers and songs and customs and holidays . Jossi and Yakov studied the great post-Talmudic scholars  --  Moses Maimonides and Rashi . Although the Rabinsky family lived a grim existence it was not entirelya life without hope or joy . There was always talk and debate , a tempting scandal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation or a birth to celebrate . There were the holidays to look forward to . The matchmakers were constantly busy and there was the Sabbath . On one night each week , Simon Rabinsky and every other ghetto Jew became a king . The traditional horn would sound in the ghetto , and Simon would lay down his tools and prepare for his day with God . How he loved the sound of the horn ! It was the same sound that had called his people to prayer and to battle for four thousand years . Simon would go to the ritual bath while his good wife Rachel lit the Sabbath candles and recited a benediction . He would dress in his Sabbath finery , a long black silk coat and a beautiful fur-rimmed hat . He would walk proudly to synagogue with Jossi on one arm and Yakov on the other . At home there was traditionally a family poorer than his in to share the Sabbath meal . Over the candles and the blessed bread and wine he spoke a blessing and a few words of gratitude to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broth , and in the evening they would stroll through the ghetto calling upon the sick or receiving visitors in their shop , as they had no parlor . On Saturday , Simon Rabinsky prayed and meditated and spoke with his sons and reviewed their lessons and learnings and discussed religionand philosophy . As the sun set ending the Sabbath , Simon sang the song of the ghetto with Rachel , Yakov , and Jossi : " Rejoice to Israel . . . banish despair . " With the day over he returned to the realities of his bitter life . In the dingy cellar he called home and shop , Simon Rabinsky would crouch over his workbench in the candlelight , with his wrinkled handsp207drive a knife deftly through leather . Simon then said the same lament that had been said by Jews since their captivity in Babylon .. . " If I forget thee , 0 Jerusalem , let my right hand forget her cunning . . . let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth ; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a believer among men . But even one so devout could not shut his eyes to the misery around and about him . " How long , 0 Lord . . . how long ... ? " he would ask . " How long must we live in this abysmal darkness ? " And then his heart would grow light and he would become exalted as he repeated his favorite passage of the Passover Prayer  --  " Next year in Jerusalem . " Next year in Jerusalem ? Would it ever come ? Would the Messiah ever come to take them back . . . ? Yakov and Jossi walked home from the seminary . Jossi 's head was bowed ; he was deep in thought , wondering about the meaning of certain passages of the Torah he had studied that afternoon . Young Yakov danced around on his toes flinging rocks at various objects in the street . He always carried a pocket full of rocks in case they ran into some bullies . As they approached the corner near home , Yakov grabbed Jossi 's wrist . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shop , " he said . " I heard all about it , " Jossi said . " Will you go this time ? " " No . " " You should go tonight , " Yakov said ; " there is going to be a real Bilu from Palestine to speak . " Jossi 's heart pounded ! A real Bilu from Palestine ! How he would love to see and hear someone who had actually been to Palestine . Secretly Jossi envied his younger brother , who had been sneaking off to Lovers of Zion meetings . His curiosity was aroused by this new organization which spoke of the defense of the ghetto and a return to the Holy Land , A real Bilu ! No  --  he would not yield to temptation  --  never so long as his father objected to the Lovers of Zion . They turned the corner and entered the shop , first kissing the mezuzah , a tiny prayer scroll nailed to the doorpost . The place smelledp208strongly of leather . Simon looked up from his workbench and smiled . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a curtain over the alcove which served as their bedroom in one corner of the shop . Simon knew by their manner that they had been discussing something in secret and he also knew full well what young Yakov had been up to , but he did not say a word . The boys must have their fling , Simon thought  --  I will not impose my will on them in this matter nor will I speak to them unless they speak to me first . Simon could be considered among the more fortunate Jews of the ghetto . His family was in good health and he had a trade which allowedhim to exist , however meagerly . The mortality rate of Jews in the Pale was more than twice that of the rest of the population of Russia . Not only the Jews were near starvation . Most of Russia , especially the peasantry , hovered on the brink of destitution . The country wallowedin the backwash of feudalism , refused to industrialize , and was exploited by the aristocracy . Bread , land , and reform movements sprang up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst , there were always Jews to be found in any organization which strived to alleviate the wretched conditions . Unrest mounted throughout Russia . An undercurrent which spelled revolution was brewing . Only then did Czar Alexander II institute some long overdue reforms . His first move was to free the serfs and he relaxed some of the stringent anti-Jewish statutes . The new laws even allowed a limited number of professional and artisan Jews to live in Moscow . In Bessarabia a few Jews could purchase land . However , the reforms were mere crumbs . In trying desperately to divert the people 's attention from the real issue of tyranny , the masterminds behind the Czar found a new and convenient use for the old scapegoats , the Jews . Hatred for the Jew in Russia had been based on religious bias , ignorance , and superstition , coupled with the peasants ' blind hostility due to their inferior status . The Russian government decided to make anti-Semitism a deliberatepolitical weapon . They launched a campaign in which the number of Jewish members in the Bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plot of Jewish anarchists out to seize the government for their own profit . It was furthered as the Russian government secretly drummed up , sponsored , fostered , and condoned bloody pogroms in which ghettos of the Pale were sacked , the women raped , and blood flowed freely.  |p209As  the mobs tore through the ghettos the Russian police either turned their backs or actively engaged in the affairs . On March 13 , 1881 , an awesome catastrophe befell the Jews . Czar Alexander II was assassinated by a rebel 's bomb , and one of the convictedrevolutionaries was a Jewish girl ! This paved the way for years of horror . The power behind the new Czar Alexander III was the sinister Pobiedonostsev . He handled the weak-minded new ruler like an infant . Pobiedonostsev regarded the principles of equality , bread , and democracy as extremely vulgar and set out to crush them ruthlessly . As for the Jews , Pobiedonostsev had special plans . As procurator of the Holy Synod he received a silent nod from the Greek Church for his scheme which called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through government-sponsored pogroms , starvation , and other forms of murder . One third would go through expulsion and exile . One third would be converted . Easter week , 1881 . The coronation of Czar Alexander III was the signal to begin . Pobiedonostsev 's pogroms erupted and spread to everycity of the Pale . After the first outbursts , Pobiedonostsev quickly had a dozen laws enacted that either eradicated any previous gains made by the Jews or aimed to destroy the rest of the Jewish population . In the wake of the awful happenings of 1881 the Jews of the Pale groped desperately for an answer to their problems . A thousand ideas were advanced  --  each more impractical than the last . In many corners of many ghettos a new voice was heard by a group who called themselvesHovevey Zion  --  the Lovers of Zion . Along with the Lovers of Zion came a document from the pen of Leo Pinsker which seemed to pinpoint the causes and solution of the Jewish plight . Pinsker 's document called for auto-emancipation as the only way out for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of Jewish students from Romny bolted from the Pale and made for Palestine with the motto on their lips , " Beth Yakov Leku Venelkha  --  House of Jacob , let us go up ! " This daring band of adventurers , forty in number , became known far and wide by the initials of their motto , which in transliteration became the " Bile . " The Bilus started a small farming village in the Sharon Valley of Palestine . They named it Rishon le Zion : First to Zion . The pogroms in the Pale increased in fury , reaching new heights of bloody destruction on Easter morning 1882 in the town of Balta ..  |p210As  a result new groups of Bilus struck out for the Promised Land and the Lovers of Zion grew by leaps and bounds . In the Sharon the Bilus founded Petah Tikva : the Gate of Hope . In the Galilee they founded Rosh Pinna : the Cornerstone . In Samaria they founded Zichron Yakov : the Memory of Jacob . By the year 1884 a half dozen small , weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each night in Zhitomir and in every other city of the Pale there were secret meetings . Youths began to rebel and to be diverted from the old ways . Yakov Rabinsky , the younger of the brothers , was swept up in the new ideology . Often during the night he lay awake , staring into the darkness in the alcove of the shop he shared with his brother Jossi . How wonderful it would be to be able to fight ! How wonderful to strike out and really find the Holy Land ! Yakov 's head was filled with the past glory of the Hebrews . Often he pretended he fought alongsideJudah " the Hammer " as the Maccabees swept the Greeks from Judea . He , Yakov Rabinsky , would be there as Judah Maccabee enteredJerusalem and rededicated the Temple . Yakov Rabinsky would be there with Simon Bar Giora , who held Jerusalem against the might of Rome for eighteen long months . He would be there in chains alongside Giora as the proud Hebrew warrior was led off to Rome to the lions ' den @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  Bar Kochba , the scourge of the Romans . He would be there at the stands at Herodium and Machaerus and Masada and Beitar , where they fought to the last man after several years of siege . And of all his heroes , Yakov wanted most to be with Rabbi Akiva when he met his martyrdom at Caesarea , for Akiva was teacher , scholar , and fighter all in one . When the Lovers of Zion came around to Zhitomir , Yakov ran off to the meetings immediately . Their message of auto-emancipation was music to his ears . The Lovers of Zion wanted his brother Jossi because of his size and strength ; but Jossi out of respect for his father as commanded by God was slow to move toward these radical ideas . The day after the Bilu from Palestine spoke in Hacohen 's candle shop , Jossi could stand it no longer . He wanted to know everything from Yakov  --  how the Bilu looked  --  every word he said  --  every gesture.  | " I think , Jossi , the time has come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would mark the first time in his life he had openly gone against his father 's wishes . " Very well , " he whispered , and all that day asked forgiveness for what he was about to do . The brothers told their father they were going to say Kaddish , a mourner 's prayer , for a friend who had recently died . They sped off to the shop of Hacohen , the candlemaker . It was a tiny basement shop like their own home . It smelled of wax and sweet scents . Curtains were drawn over the windows . Guards were posted outside on the street . Jossi was surprised at how many familiar faces he saw in the packed room . The speaker was a man from Odessa named Vladimir . Vladimir neither looked nor acted like them . He had no beard or side curls . He wore boots and a black leather jacket . As he began to speak Yakov became entranced , and around the room a half dozen hecklers started up . " Are you the Messiah who has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you find the Messiah under your bed when you hid during the last pogrom ? " Vladimir rejoined . " Are you sure you are not one of the Czar 's spies ? " " Are you sure you are not one of the Czar 's next victims ? " Vladiinirretorted . The room quieted down . Vladimir spoke softly . He reviewed the history of the Jews in Poland and in Russia and then expanded his summary to include Germany and Austria as well . Then he spoke of the expulsions from England and France  --  then of the massacres at Bray and York and Spires and Worms . Vladimir spoke of how the Pope had called upon the Christians to regain the Holy Land from the Moslems and of how five Crusades over three hundred years were directed against the Jews in the name of God . Vladimir spoke of one of the most horrible periods of all  --  the Spanish Inquisition , during which unbelievable atrocities against the Jews were committed in the name of the Church . " Comrades , every nation on the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nation . It is our only salvation . Pinsker has seen it and the Lovers of Zion see it and the Bilus see it . We must tebuild the House of Jacob ! " Yakov 's heart was pounding as the boys left the meeting . " See ,  |p212Jossi  ! What did I tell you ! You saw tonight that even Rabbi Lipzin was there . " " I must think about it , " Jossi said defensively . But even as he spoke he knew that Vladimir was right and Yakov too . It was their only salvation . The street was quiet and dark and they walked briskly . They reached their home , quickly kissed the mezuzah , and went in . A candle was burning on Simon 's bench . He stood behind it in his long nightshirt with his hands clasped behind him . " Hello , Papa , " they said quickly , and tried to duck into their alcove . " Boys ! " Simon commanded . They walked slowly before his bench . Their mother walked into the room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys home ? " " They are home . " " Tell them they should n't be on the streets so late . " " Yes , Mama , " Simon said . " Go to sleep and I shall speak to them . " Simon looked from Yakov to Jossi and back to Yakov . " I must tell Mrs. Horowitz tomorrow that her husband can surelyrest in peace because my sons joined in a minyan for him tonight . " It was impossible for Jossi to lie to his father . " We were n't at minyanfor Reb Horowitz , " he mumbled . Simon Rabinsky feigned surprise and held his hands aloft . " Oh ... so ! I should have known . You boys were courting . Just today Abraham , the matchmaker , was in the shop . He said to me , Simon Rabinsky , ' he said , you have a fine boy in Jossi . Jossi will bring you a handsome dowry from the family of some very fortunate girl . ' Can you imagine . . . he wants to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were not courting , " Jossi gulped . " Not courting ? No minyan ? Perhaps you went back to the synagogueto study ? " " No , Father , " Jossi said almost inaudibly . Yakov could stand it no longer . " We went to a Lovers of Zion meeting ! " Jossi looked up at his father sheepishly , bit his lip , and noddedred-faced . Yakov seemed glad it was in the open . He stood defiant . Simon sighed and stared at both his sons for a full five minutes . " I am hurt , " he announced at last . " That is why we did riot tell you , Father . We did not want to hurt you , " Jossi said . " I am not hurt because you went to a Lovers of Zion meeting . I am hurt because the sons of Simon Rabinsky think so little of that father they no longer confide in him . "  |p213Now  Yakov squirmed too . " But if we 'd told you , " he said , " you might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yakov ... when have I ever forbidden you to pursue knowledge ? Have I ever forbidden a book ? God help me . . . even the time you took the notion into your head that you wanted to read the New Testament ? Did I forbid that ? " " No , sir , " Yakov said . " I think a talk is long overdue , " Simon said . The candlelight seemed to blend with the red of Jossi 's hair . He stood half a head taller than his father and now as he spoke he did not falter . Although Jossi was slow in making up his mind , once it was up he rarely changed it . " Yakov and I did not want to hurt you because we know how you feel about the Lovers of Zion and the new ideas . But I am glad I went tonight . " " I am glad you went too , " Simon said . " Rabbi Lipzin wants me to sign up for ghetto defense , " Jossi said . " Rabbi Lipzin departs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a Jew , " Simon said . " That is just the point , Father , " Jossi said . " You are afraid of the new ideas . " It was the first time Jossi had ever spoken thus to his father and he was immediately ashamed . Simon walked around the counter and put his hands on his sons ' shoulders and led them into their alcove and bade them sit down on their beds . " Do n't you think I know what is going through your minds ? New ideas , indeed . There was exactly the same talk about auto-emancipation and ghetto defense when I was a boy . You are only coming to a crisis that every Jew comes to . . . to make your peace with the world . . . to know your place . When I was a boy I even thought once of converting . . . do n't you think I know how it feels ? " Jossi was astonished . His father had thought of conversion ! " Why is it wrong for us to want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own people to want to better our conditions ? " Yakov demanded . " You are a Jew , " his father answered , " and being a Jew entails certain obligations . " " To hide under my bed while people try to kill me ? " " Do n't raise your voice to Father , " Jossi admonished . " No one said it is easy to be a Jew . We were not born on this earth live from its fruits . We were put here to guard the laws of God . is is our mission . This is our purpose . " " And this is our reward ! " Yakov snapped back.  | " The Messiah will come and take us back when He is good and ready , " Simon said , unruffled , " and I do not believe it is for Yakov Rabinsky to question His wisdom . I do believe it is for Yakov Rabinskyto live by the laws of the Holy Torah . " There were tears of anger in Yakov 's eyes . " I do not question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I question the wisdom of some of the men who interpret those laws . " There was a brief silence . Jossi swallowed . Never had anyone spoken so harshly to his father . Yet he silently applauded his brother 's courage , for Yakov was daring to ask the very questions he himself dared not ask . " If we are created in the image of God , " Yakov continued , " then the Messiah is in all of us and the Messiah inside me keeps telling me to stand up and fight back . He keeps telling me to make my way back to the Promised Land with the Lovers of Zion . That is what the Messiah tells me , Father . " Simon Rabinsky would not be shaken . " In our history we have been plagued with false messiahs . I fear you are listening to one of them now . " " And how do I recognize the true Messiah ? " Yakov challenged . " The question is not whether Yakov Rabinsky recognizes the Messiah . The question is whether the Messiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stray from His laws and listens to false prophets , then the Messiah will be quite certain that he is no longer a Jew . I suggest to Yakov Rabinsky that he continue to live as a Jew as his father and his people are doing . " CHAPTER FOUR : " Kill the Jews ! " A rock smashed through the seminary window . The rabbi hurried the students out through the back to the safety of the cellar . In the streets , Jews scampered wildly for cover ahead of a frenzied mob of over a thousand students and Cossacks . " Kill the Jews ! " they screamed . " Kill the Jews ! " It was another pogrom inspired by Andreev , the humpbacked headmasterof a local gymnasium  --  high school  --  and foremost Jew hater in Zhitomir . Andreev 's students swaggered down the streets of the ghetto , smashing up store fronts and dragging any Jews they could find into the streets and beating them mercilessly . " Kill the Jews . . . kill the Jews . . . kill the Jews ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route through back alleys , they sped over deserted cobblestone streets to reach their home and protect their parents . They ducked frequently for cover and worked away from the sounds of hoofbeats of Cossack horses and from the bloodcurdling screams of the students . They turned the corner into their street and ran head on into a dozen hoodlums wearing university caps  --  disciples of Andreev . " There go two of them ! " Yakov and Jossi turned around and fled , leading the pack of pursuersaway from their own home . The students howled with glee as they sprinted after the brothers . For fifteen minutes they wove in and out of streets and alleys until the students trapped them against a dead-end wall . Jossi and Yakov stood with their backs to the wall , dripping sweat and panting for breath as the students formed a semicircleand closed in on them . His eyes gleaming , the leader stepped forward with an iron pipe and swung on Jossi ! Jossi blocked the blow and snatched up the student , spun him around , lifted him over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions . Yakov , whose pocket full of rocks was for just such occasions , bounced two stones off the heads of two students , sending them to the ground unconscious . The other students scattered in flight . The boys dashed home and flung open the door of the shop . " Mama ! Papa ! " The shop was a shambles . " Mama ! Papa ! " They found their mother cowering in a corner in a state of hysteria . Jossi shook her hard . " Where is Papa ? " " The Torah ! " she shrieked . " The Torah ! " At that instant , six blocks away , Simon Rabinsky staggered into his burning synagogue and fought his way gagging to the end of the room where the Holy Ark stood . He threw back the curtains with the Ten Commandments inscribed on them and pulled down the Sefer Torah , the Scroll of the Laws of God . Simon pressed the holy parchment against his breast to protect it from the flames and staggered back to the door . He was badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knees . Twenty of Andreev 's students were waiting for him . " Kill the Jew ! " Simon crawled a few yards and collapsed , covering the Sefer Torah with his body . Clubs smashed his skull . Hobnailed boots ripped his " Kill the Jew ! " In mortal agony Simon Rabinsky screamed out . . . " Hear , 0 Israel . . . the Lord is our God . . . the Lord is one ! " When they found Simon Rabinsky he was beyond recognition . The Sefer Torah , the laws which God had given Moses , had been burned by the mob . The entire Zhitomir ghetto mourned his passing . He had died in the noblest way a Jew could meet death  --  protecting the Sefer Torah . Simon was put to rest along with a dozen others who had been murderedin Andreev 's pogrom . For Rachel Rabinsky , the death of her husband was but another tragedy in a life which had known little else but sorrow . But this time her strength and will were gone . Even her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live with relatives in another town . Jossi and Yakov went to synagogue twice each day to say Kaddish for their father . Jossi remembered how his father had wanted to live as a Jew so that the Messiah would recognize him . His whole missionin life had been to protect God 's laws . Perhaps his father had been right  --  perhaps it was not theirs to live from the fruits of the earth but to serve as the guardians of God 's laws . In his sorrow Jossi probed to find a reason for his father 's brutal death . Yakov was different . His heart was full of hatred . Even as he went to say the mourners ' prayers , his soul demanded revenge . He seethed and smoldered  --  he was restless and angry . He muttered time and again that he would avenge his father 's death . Jossi , knowing his brother 's state of mind , barely let him out of his sight . He tried to soothe and comfort Yakov but Yakov was inconsolable . A month after the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the night as Jossi slept . He took from his father 's bench a long sharp knife and hid it in his belt and ventured from the ghetto toward the school where Andreev the Jew hater lived . Jossi awoke instinctively a few minutes later . The instant he saw Yakov was gone he dressed hurriedly and ran after him . He knew where his brother would be going . At four o'clock in the morning , Yakov Rabinsky pulled the brass knocker on the door of Andreev 's house . As the demented hunchback opened the door , Yakov sprang from the shadows and plunged the knife deep into his heart . Andreev emitted one short shriek and rolled to the ground , dead.  |p217A  few moments later Jossi rushed onto the scene to find his brother standing hypnotized over the body of the slain man . He pulled Yakov away and they fled . All the next day and night they hid in the cellar of Rabbi Lipzin 's house . Word of Andreev 's murder spread quickly throughout Zhitomir . The elders of the ghetto met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fear that you two were spotted , " the rabbi said when he returned . " Your red hair , Jossi , was seen by some students . " Jossi bit his lip and did not reveal that he had only been trying to prevent the crime . Yakov showed no remorse for his deed . " I would do it again , gladly , " he said . " Although we understand well what drove you to this deed , " said the rabbi , " it can not be forgiven . You may well have started another pogrom . On the other hand . . . we are Jews and there is no justice for us in a Russian court . We have reached a decision you are to abide by . " " Yes , Rabbi , " Jossi said . " You are to cut off your curls and dress like goyim . We will give you food and money enough to travel for a week . You must leave Zhitomir at once and never return . " In 1884 , Yakov and Jossi Rabinsky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads only by night and hid during the day , moving east to Lubny , a distance of a hundred-odd miles from Zhitomir . At Lubny they found the ghetto immediately and sought out the rabbi , only to learn that their notoriety had preceded them . The rabbi and the elders of Lubny met and agreed to give the boys enough food and money for another week 's travel . This time their destination was Kharkov , some two hundred miles away , where the search for them might not be so intense . Advance word was sent to the Kharkov rabbi that the Rabinsky boys were on the way . The entire countryside was on the alert for the Rabinsky brothers . It took twenty days of cautious moving for them to get to Kharkov . Their fame had spread throughout the Pale , and their capture was being turned into a holy mission . For two weeks they hid in the clammy basement beneath the synagogue in Kharkov , their presence known only to the rabbi and a few elders . At last the Rabbi Solomon came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " It is only a matter of time until you boys are disvered . Already the police have been prowling around asking quesns . But with winter coming on it will be near impossible to move . "  |p218The  rabbi sighed and shook his head . " We have also tried to get you papers to enable you to travel beyond the Pale , but I am afraid that is impossible . You are too well known by the police . " He paced back and forth . " We have decided there is but one thing to do . There are some Jewish families in this district who have passed as gentiles and who own small farms . We feel it would be the safest plan for you to hide with one of them until spring at least . " " Rabbi Solomon , " Jossi said , " we are very thankful for everything that has been done for us , but my brother and I have made a plan of our own . " " What is that ? " " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbi looked stunned . " To Palestine ? How ? " " We have a route in mind . God will help us . " " No doubt God will help you but let us not press Him for a miracle . It is over three hundred hard cold miles to the port of Odessa . Even if and when you reach Odessa you can not get a boat without papers . " " We are not going by way of Odessa . " " But there is no other way . " " We intend to walk . " Rabbi Solomon gasped . " Moses walked for forty years , " Yakov said ; " it will not take us that long . " " Young man , I am well aware that Moses walked for forty years . That does not explain how you are going to walk to Palestine . " " I 'll tell you our plan , " Jossi said . " We will go south . The police wo n't be looking for us so strenuously in that direction . We will cross out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Turkey . " " Madness ! Insanity ! It can not be done ! Do you mean to tell me you will walk over two thousand miles , through the cold of winter , across strange lands and fifteen-thousand-foot mountain ranges withoutpapers . . . without knowledge of the country . . . with the policeafter you ? Why , you are but little more than children ! " Yakov 's eyes were burning with passion ; he looked at the rabbi . " Fear not for I am with thee . I will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west . I will say to the north , give up and to the south , keep not back ; bring my sons from far , and my daughters from the ends of the earth . "  |p219And  so it came to pass that the Rabinsky brothers who were wanted for murder fled from Kharkov and moved to the east and to the south through an inhumanly bitter winter . They trudged through waist-high snow during the night , bending their young bodies against howling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumbled with hunger . They stole from the countryside and in the hours of daylight they hid in the forests . Through those tortured nights it was Yakov who filled Jossi with the spirit of their mission . It was Yakov who urged another step and another and yet another when all strength was gone . It was Jossi with his powerful body who held his younger brother up . Between their two strengths they somehow managed to keep alive and moving . Many a night Jossi had to carry Yakov on his back for eight hours because the younger brother 's feet were raw and bleeding and he could not walk . Many a day Jossi had to sleep on top of Yakov to pass his warmth on to his weaker brother . Often they crawled the last few yards to a hiding place . Over the ice and the snow they staggered south with but cloth wrappings around their feet  --  yard after yard  --  mile after mile  --  week after week . In the spring they reached Rostov and collapsed . They found the ghetto and were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new clothing . They had to rest several weeks before they were fit enough to continue the journey . Late in the spring they went on again , fully recovered from their winter 's flight . Although they did not now have to contend with the elements they had to move with greater caution , for they had left the Pale behind and could no longer depend on protection , food , and shelter from the Jewish communities . They skirted the Black Sea south of Rostov and moved deep into Georgia . All their food now was stolen from the fields  --  they never let themselves be seen by daylight . As winter came on again they were faced with a tremendous decision . To hole up in Georgia , to try to get through the Caucasus Mountains in winter , or  --  to attempt a boat across the Black Sea . Each plan had its dangers . Although trying the mountains in winerseemed the most foolhardy their urge to leave Russia behind wasgreat that they decided to risk it . At Stavropol at the base of the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clothing and food forp220the assault over the mountains . Then they fled into the Caucasus towardArmenia with the police on their track . Through another brutal winter they moved deep into the mountains , walking by day , climbing the treacherous passes in the dark , and pillaging the countryside . The first year had hardened them and made them wise  --  the obsession to get to Palestine was greater than ever and drove them onward . Yakov would babble passages from the Bible by the hour to drive their bodies forward . They made the last part of their push instinctively , in a numbed daze . And in spring they received their second miracle of rebirth . One day they stood up and for the first time breathed free air  --  as they left " Mother Russia " behind them forever . As Yakov passed the border marker into Turkey he turned and spat into Russia . Now they could move in daylight , but it was a strange land with strange sounds and smells and they had no passports or papers . All of eastern Turkey was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in the fields in places where they could not steal food , but twice that spring they were caught and thrown into prison briefly. jossi reckoned they would have to give up thievery , for it was too dangerous being caught ; they might be sent back to Russia . In the middle of summer they passed the base of Mount Ararat where the Ark of Noah had landed . They pressed on to the south . In each village they asked , " Are there Jews here ? " In some there would be Jews and they would be fed and clothed and sheltered and sent along their way . These Jews were different from any they had known . They were peasants filled with ignorance and superstition , yet they knew their Torah and kept the Sabbath and the Holy Days . " Are there Jews here ? " " We are Jews . " " Let us see your rabbi . " " Where are you boys going ? " " We are walking to the Promised Land . " It was the magic password . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish family in the next village . " Never once were they refused hospitality . Two years went by . The brothers pressed on doggedly , stopping only when exhaustion overcame them or they had to work for food . " Are there Jews here ? " They pressed over the Turkish border into the province of Syria and another strange land.  |p221In  Aleppo they received their first taste of the Arab world . They passed through bazaars and dung-filled streets and heard Moslem chants from the minarets -- They walked on until the blue-green of the Mediterranean Sea burst suddenly before them and the howling winds and cold of the past years were exchanged for a blistering heat of one hundred and twenty degrees . They plodded down the Levantine coast wearing Arab rags . " Are there Jews here ? " Yes , there were Jews , but again they were different . These Jews looked and dressed and spoke like Arabs . But yet they knew the Hebrew language and the Torah . Like the Jews of the Pale and the Jews of Turkey , the Arab-like Jews took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food . They blessed the brothers as they had been blessed before for the sacredness of their mission . On into Lebanon they walked  --  through Tripoli and the wildness of Beirut  --  they neared the Promised Land . " Are there Jews here ? " The year was 1888 . Forty months had passed since that night Yakov and Jossi fled the Zhitomir ghetto . Jossi had grown into a lean and leathery giant six feet three inches tall with a frame of steel . He was twenty years of age and he wore a flaming red beard . Yakov was eighteen and also hardened by the more than three years of travel but he was still of medium height with dark sensitive featuresand was filled with the same intenseness he had had from childhood . They stood upon a hill . Below them was a valley . Yakov and Jossi Rabinsky stared down at the Huleh in northern Galilee . Jossi Rabinsky sat down upon a rock and wept . Their journey was over . " But the Lord liveth , " Yakov said , " which brought u @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the north country and from all the countries whither I had driven them , and they shall dwell in their own kind . " Yakov put his hand on Jossi 's shoulder . " We are home , Jossi ! We are home ! " CHAPTER FIVE : From the hill they looked down onto the land . Across the valley in Lebanon rose the towering snow-capped peak ofp222Mount Hermon . Below them stretched the Huleh Lake and marshes . There was an Arab village nestled in the hills to their right . Jossi Rabinsky experienced the greatest exaltation he had ever known ! How beautiful the Promised Land looked from here ! He vowed to himself , as young men will at such times , that he would return someday and from this very spot would look down on his very own land . They stayed there for a day and a night and the next morning beganthe descent in the direction of the Arab village . The white-colored mud houses clumped together in a saddle of the hill were dazzling in the morning sun . The farmlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Huleh Lake . In the fields a donkey pulled a wooden plowshare . Other donkeys carried small harvest upon their backs . In the vineyards the Arab women labored among the grapes . The village was as it must have been a thousand years before . The distant beauty of the village faded with each step they took nearer and was soon replaced by an overwhelming stench . Suspicious eyes watched the brothers from the fields and the houses of the villageas they entered the dirt street . Life moved in slow motion in the blistering sun . The road was filled with camel and donkey excrement . Swarms of giant flies engulfed the brothers . A lazy dog lay motionless in the water of the open sewer to cool himself . Veiled women ducked for cover into squalid one-room houses made of mud ; half the huts were in a state of near collapse and held a dozen or more people , as well as pigs , chickens , mules , and goats . The boys stopped at the village water well . Straight-backed girls balanced enormous urns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrubbing clothing and exchanging gossip . The appearance of the travelers brought immediate silence . " May we have some water ? " Jossi asked . No one dared answer . Haltingly they drew a bucket of water , splashed their faces , filled their canteens , and made off quickly . Further on they came upon a dilapidated shack which served as a coffeehouse . Listless men sat or lay around on the ground as their wives tilled the fields . Some played backgammon . The air was foul with the mixed aroma of thick coffee , tobacco , hashish smoke , and the vile odors of the rest of the village . " We would like directions , " Jossi said . After several moments one of the Arabs pulled himself off the ground and bade them follow . He led them out of the main area to ap223stream ; on the other side of the stream was a small mosque and a minaret . On their side was a nicely built stone house set in the shade , and near it a room which served as the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told to enter and be seated . The high walls of the room were whitewashed , and thick , well-placed windows made it quite cool . A long bench ran around the walls . The bench was covered with bright pillows . On the walls hung an assortment of swords and trinkets and pictures of Arabs and visitors . At last a man in his mid-twenties entered . He was dressed in an ankle-length striped cloth coat and a white headdress with a black band . His appearance immediately indicated that he was someone of wealth . " I am Kammal , muktar of Abu Yesha , " he said . He clapped his ringed hands together and ordered fruit and coffee to be brought to the strangers . As his brothers went off to carry out the order a cold half silence pervaded the room as the village elders filed in one by one . To the boys ' surprise , Kammal spoke some Hebrew . " The site of this village is the traditional burial place of Joshua , " he told them . " You see , Joshua is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then , following the Arab custom of never asking a direct question , Kammal set out to find out who the visitors were and what their missionwas . At last he suggested that perhaps the boys were lost  --  for no Jews had ventured into the Iluleh before . Jossi explained that they had entered the country from the north and sought the nearest Jewish settlement . After another half hour of roundabout questions Kammal seemed satisfied that the two Jews were not scouting for land in the area . Then Kammal seemed to relax a bit ; he confided that he was not only the muktar and owned all the land in Abu Yesha but the spiritual leader as well and the only literate person in the village . Jossi somehow liked this man  --  for what reason , he did not know . le told Kammal about their pilgrimage from Russia and their desire o settle down and farm in the Holy Land . When the last of the fruit ad been eaten , Jossi asked his leave . " You will find Jews thirty kilometers south . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . The place is called Rosh inna . " Rosh Pinna ! How exciting ! He had heard the name many times in he Pale.  | " Rosh Pinna is halfway between the Huleh Lake and the Sea of Galilee . On the way you will pass a large tel . Beneath the tel lies the ancient city of Hazor . . . . May God protect you on your journey . " The road took them past the fields of Abu Yesha and skirted the forbidding Huleh swamplands . Jossi looked back over his shoulder . He could see the spot from which they had crossed earlier that day . " I 'll be back , " he said to himself . " I know I 'll be back --  " At midday they came upon the large man-made hill Kammal had described . As they climbed upward they realized that beneath them lay buried the ancient city of Hazor . Jossi was elated . " Do you realize that Joshua may have been standing on this very spot when he conqueredthe city from the Canaanites ! " Jossi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about . Since his very first sight of the Holy Land , Jossi had been in such a state of joy that he was completely unaware of the bad mood that had been overtaking Yakov . Yakov did not want to spoil his brother 's happiness so he remained silent , but his sullenness grew by the minute . At dusk they reached Rosh Pinna , the Cornerstone , the farthest northern settlement of Jews . Their arrival produced a great furor . In a small building which served as the meeting room they were eagerly questioned . But it was forty months since they had left Zhitomir and they could only say that the pogroms that had started in 1881 were getting progressively worse . Although both boys concealed their feelings , Rosh Pinna was a terribledisappointment . Instead of flourishing farms they found a rundownvillage . There were but a few dozen Jews living midst conditions not much better than those of the Arabs of Abu Yesha . " Sometimes I think it would have been better to have stayed in Russia , " one of the Bilus opined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews . We had books to read , music to hear , and people to speak to . . . there were women . Here , there is nothing . " " But all those things we heard at the Lovers of Zion meetings --  " Jossi said . " Oh yes , we were filled with ideals when we arrived . One soon loses them in this country . Look at it . . . so ruined that nothing can grow . What little we do have is stolen by the Bedouins , and the Turks take what the Bedouins leave . If I were you boys I 'd keep on going to Jaffa and get on the next boat to America . " An outlandish idea , Jossi thought.
