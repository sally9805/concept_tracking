THE HOME LETTERS OF T. E. LAWRENCE AND HIS BROTHERS ( 731 pp. ) - Macm/7/an ( $10 ) . <P> No argument can change the elderly Englishman 's probably accurate belief that his country and his world suffered an irremediable loss in " The War " - meaning , of course , World War I. The nature of that loss is defined in The Home Letters of <P> T. E. Lawrence and His Brothers , a massive volume of letters , written mostly by Lawrence of Arabia to his parents . They are not " great " letters-in fact , many are unspeakably dull . They are of interest today because they bring momentarily to life the principal ghosts of the lamented era . <P> The Lawrence family , of 2 Polstead Road , Oxford , consisted of father , mother and five sons . In this " nest of young eagles " ( as an Oxford don termed it ) was an atmosphere of faith , eagerness and self-confidence that seems closer in time to the court of King Arthur than to the 20th century .

" Lovable , affectionate , happy and gentle . " Frank had no time to ripen for anything but slaughter . In a letter marked " Not to be delivered till after my death , " Frank bade his parents a cheerful farewell - " the parting will not be for long . Merely for an infinitesimal space of time out of eternity . " He was killed at 22 , three months after joining the Gloucester Regiment at the front in France . <P> It fell to Brother Ned ( T. E. ) to perform the deeds that brought fame to the family name . Ned was fond of literature , music and machinery , but his chief passion was archaeology-a bent that led him slowly but steadily through the ruined castles and abbeys of Britain and France to the " diggings " of Mesopotamia and the Arabian desert .
