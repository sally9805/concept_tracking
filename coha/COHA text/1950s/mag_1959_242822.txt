Dwight Eisenhower 's 146th veto message whirred through the White House Mimeograph machine one morning last week before Congress had even sent him the bill to be rejected : the $1.2 billion rivers and harbors appropriation , almost exactly the same old vote-catching " pork barrel " smashed by the 144th veto two weeks earlier . This time , Ike knew , Democrats were dead certain that they could muster the necessary two-thirds to override-and end-the remarkable string of unbeaten Eisenhower vetoes. * <P> Perfect record or no , the President did not consider signing the bill , which still contained down payments to start 67 new civil-works construction projects not in the budget ( eventual cost : $800 million ) that he had objected to the first time . The only congressional change : a 2% across-the-board cut in funds for all projects . This cynical gesture at economy , the President pointed out , would only impede " orderly work on going projects and result in an increase in costs instead of a saving . " <P> Bouncing the bill back to the Hill half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader Charlie Halleck of Indiana to insist upon another last-ditch stand such as Halleck staged to sustain the previous veto by one vote ( TIME , Sept. 14 ) . That upset victory had won Halleck a bottle of presidential Scotch ; another , joked the President , would win a second bottle . Halleck swore to do his all , dutifully got off wires and cables to absentees , cracked the G.O.P. whip . But since their support of the first veto , a critical number of his hard-pressed Republicans and antipork Democrats had become convinced that a second antipork vote would bring defeat in next year 's elections . Result : 280 ( 260 Democrats , 20 Republicans ) to 121 ( 5 Democrats , 116 Republicans ) , a lucky 13 votes more than the Democrats needed to override . <P> Speaker Sam Rayburn , vindicated in his promise to " lick ' em " on the pork barrel , beamed broadly . Same day the Senate gleefully followed the House with a 72-23 vote to override , eight extra , and the bill became law . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory over " Government by veto . " Some , however , detected a sour aftertaste . The President is not required to release funds for new projects , will probably start few of the obnoxious 67 projects . More important , in a strictly partisan decision , congressional Democrats dipped into the narrowly balanced budget to fund the oldest , most obvious form of political spending in federal politics . Cracked White House Press Secretary James Hagerty in a rare reflection of presidential cynicism : " The lure of the pork barrel was a little too much for Congress to avoid . " <P> Last week , rushing toward adjournment , Congress also : <P> Warded off a third housing-bill veto by accepting White House direction on where to make further cuts ( the $50 million college-classroom program , a spread-out in the spending of $650 million urban renewal funds ) , but retained some of the Ike-disliked features ( a $50 million program to build homes for the elderly , extra public-housing starts ) in a $1 billion bill that is still high ( $200 million above budget ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
