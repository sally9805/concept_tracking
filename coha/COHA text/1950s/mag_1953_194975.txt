In a day when governments ( but not the U.S. ) and philanthropic foundations have all but taken over the art-patron business , Manhattan 's Lincoln Kirstein , 45 , is a pillar of individualism . In the past 20 years he has spent close to half a million dollars of his own money to commission and produce new music and ballets , chiefly for the vigorous New York City Ballet and its forerunners . To Patron Kirstein last week came a fittingly symbolic award : $500 and a citation from Manhattan 's Capezio Inc. , the U.S. 's largest makers of ballet slippers , " for distinguished service to American Dance . " <P> Kirstein hardly needed the money , but the citation was no more than his due . No man has done more to put U.S. ballet on its toes . <P> Dancers from All Over .

Among them the expensive , respected but short-lived highbrow magazine Hound &; Horn , Harvard 's Society for Contemporary Art a novel , a book of poems , a scholarly book on the dance . <P> At 25 , Kirstein faced up to it : ballet interested him most of all .

Kirstein induced him to leave Europe ( where he had been Diaghilev 's chief choreographer ) and take over both the school and the performing companies . <P> " We are selling about 70% of our seats every week now , " says Kirstein . " I do n't have to spend money except for commissions .

He aims to raise these two groups to the same level of esteem the ballet troupe has won .
