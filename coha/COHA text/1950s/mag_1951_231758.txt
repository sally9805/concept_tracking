The Amazing Mr. Malone* ( Fri. 9 p.m. , NBC ) rings a few changes on that tired radio perennial , the evening mystery show . Based on a character created by Whodunit Writer Craig Rice , Malone deals with a Chicago criminal lawyer whose avowed hobby is " collecting cliches . " Malone has other off-beat mannerisms : he avoids fights , employs a masseur , and dislikes guns because " they remind me of weddings . " Currently unsponsored , Malone had some fast-paced dialogue by Scripter Eugene Wang , is packed with such novelties as an effeminate gunman , a strait-laced gambler fretting about his daughter 's morals , a policeman who was on the right track from the start . <P> The Jerry Colonna Show ( Mon. 8 p.m. , ABC-TV ) , thus far unsponsored , originates in California but owes more to Minsky 's than to Hollywood , as Colonna is propelled with quivering mustache , freewheeling eyes and hog-calling tenor through a series of burlesque skits . As a barber , he uses a chamberpot for a shaving mug ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stowaway ; as a TV repairman , he pulls a battered corset from a TV set , crying : " Your condenser is weak ! " Best example of Colonna 's Klaxon charm : his screech-voiced assault on the popular song , My Heart Cries For You . <P> <P> *Not to be confused with Young Dr. Malone , no kin .
