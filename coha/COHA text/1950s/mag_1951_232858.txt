Modern medical science has produced scores of wonder drugs and made enormous technical advances . Has it meanwhile been losing the human touch ? Yes , says Swiss Dr. Ren Burnand , who believes it is high time for a return to some forgotten fundamentals . <P> Writes Burnand , a lung specialist , in Paris ' Concours Mdical : " We live under the rule of pharmacy . . . The equation <P> ' Disease a equals drug a ' not only tyrannizes the minds of the public , it haunts the practitioner , whose professional capacity is rated according to the skill with which he applies the formula . There is something still worse ; mass medicine , socialized , mechanized to excess , tends to substitute an even more deceitful equation : ' Symptom b equals drug b . ' <P> " Faced with a difficult case , too many physicians think it advisable to try a series of drugs , in the hope that a happy accident will point out the one , good , effective drug after a series of failures . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possesses in itself the defenses , a potential for cure , which they should utilize more often , with more faith . Who in our day thinks of the resources of another age-morale , the will to health , valor . . . ? But these things are still powerful . . . The faith of the patient , his will to recover and to live , to recover by life and for life , are a powerful support for our prudent counsels. "
