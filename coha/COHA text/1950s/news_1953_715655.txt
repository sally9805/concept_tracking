txt Spec/a . THE NEW YORK TIMES . UNITED NATIONS , N. Y. , Aug. 14 ? A flurry of discussions among United Nations delegates today failed to settle the dispute between the United States and Britain over the composition of the Far Eastern political conference provided for in the Korean armistice . It is generally expected the two allies will have to leave it to the General Assembly , which will reconvene Monday , to decide on the floor whether the Soviet Union and India will be invited to the conference . The dispute came into the open last night when Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , the United States Representative , announced he would oppose the selection by the Assembly of any state that had not been a belligerent . Mr. Lodge left it open for Communist China and North Korea to invite the Soviet Union for their " side , " but made it clear the United States would oppose a General Assembly invitation to either India or the Soviet Union . It is understood that Britain , with the support ' of Canada , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense of South Korea , would have no objection to a resolution that would : 9Name half a dozen of the sixteen states that supplied armed forces , together with South Korea , as participants in the conference . 9Say nothing about the participation of any other state . 9Express the hope the relief and rehabilitation of South Korea would be carried out quickly and effectively . gRequest the political conference to report its findings to the General Assembly , or in any event emphasize the link between the conference and the United Nations . No Soviet Reaction Revealed ' An agreement on this much , but perhaps no more , is expected when the delegates of the sixteen member states hold their third meeting tomorrow . This resolution would be introduced jointly by all sixteen , and to that extent would be an indication of their unity . Mr. Lodge told Latin-American delegates tonight , in fact , that the sixteen had already agreed in principle to introduce a resolution that would extend invitations to participants in the conference only on the United Nations side . He said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - South Korea , Britain , France , Australia , Canada , Colombia , the Philippines , Thailand and Turkey . The statement was received with general approval . However , there were some objections when Mr. Lodge said the United States favored a voting procedure whereby no participant at the conference would be obligated by conference decision unless that state had voted for it . In other words , it was brought out , if South Korea voted against the decision on the unification of Korea it would not be bound by it . Previously it had been assumed that , in accordance with practices at international conferences , decisions would have to be unanimous and therefore would bind all ' participants . The meetings among the pen ' principal delegates today , which included a talk between Mr. Lodge // and Lester B. Pearson of Canada , president of the General Assembly , did not give cause for further optimism . Selwyn Lloyd , British . Minister of State , and Sir Gladwyn Jebb , British Permanent Representative , conferred with Andrei Y. Vishinsky of the Soviet Union . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the Soviet Union did not want an Assembly invitation there was no word about it from the principals . Assuming the disagreement continues , it is generally expected Britain and other countries favoring an invitation to the Soviet Union and India will introduce a resolution or resolutions that would be separate from the sixteen-power resolution . If they do not , it is believed , the Arab-Asian group will . Delegates who favor an invitation to the Soviet Union believe it would get the necessary twothirds majority in the Assembly even on a separate vote . They concede the United States might be able to block it with a last-ditch stand , but in that case , they say , the Far Eastern conference would be doomed to futility in advance 1 and might ' as well not be held . The British position puts more emphasis on an invitation to the Soviet Union than to India , but linsists that both , because of their obvious interests in the area , ! should be invited . The British emphasize also that the defense of Korea was an action by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that sent armed forces , and that the conference should include members-at-large , so to speak , as well as from the opposing sides . Secretary General Comments Last night , when be disclosed the full seriousness of the split , 1Mr . Lodge took his stand on Article 60 of the armistice agreement , which provides that " the military commanders of both sides hereby-recommend to the governments concerned on both sides * * * " that the conference be held . Secretary General Dag Ham , marskjold , who had discussed the situation at length with all sides , issued a statement expressing his hope for " a constructive , cooperative approach to the problems facing the conference . " He added that " this may call for a broad interpretation " of Article 60 , emphasizing the word " broad , " and thus appeared to support the British position . Some puzzlement was caused here by a Washington dispatch saying the United States stood almost alone on the composition of the conference as well as its attempt to confine the agenda to the Korean question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States on the agenda question , but so far Colombia , Greece , the Philippines and Turkey have indicated they would support the United States stand against an Assembly invitation to non belligerents . Britain has the support not only of France but of other Western European countries . Apart from Canada , the other 1British Commonwealth countries ? Australia , New Zealand and South Africa  --  have thus far emphasized mainly the need for the United States and Britain to reach an agreed solution .
