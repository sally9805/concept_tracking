The Chicago Daily Tribune , whose masthead daily proclaims it " The World 's Greatest Newspaper , " devoted 97 inches of news space last week to what it considered the world 's greatest story . In a full column on Page One , the Trib reported breathlessly that Reuters ' Editor Walton ( " Tony " ) Cole , " the editor of the world 's greatest international newsgathering organization , " and Trib Correspondent Larry Rue , " one of the world 's most famous foreign correspondents , " had flown in from London and Vienna , respectively , on a weighty mission . The mission : to tell 400 members of the Trib 's editorial staff " why the paper is entitled to be called the world 's greatest newspaper . " <P> At the dinner , " rollicking , adventurous " Larry Rue , as the Trib called him , received a $500 award from the Trib and provided the only deprecatory note . He was quoted as saying that " he had often heard the remark : ' You 're all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune ! ' " Explained the Trib : " He always puts such people in their place by saying , ' The Tribune never asked me to work for it . I asked the Tribune . I am proud to work for the Tribune because I believe in it . ' "
