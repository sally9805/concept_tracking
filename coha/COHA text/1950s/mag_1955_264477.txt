After an agonizing 20-19 defeat by Notre Dame last year , Michigan State 's new Coach " Duffy " Daugherty went to the opponents ' dressing room and faced Notre Dame 's new Coach Terry Brennan . " Next year , " said Daugherty , " we 'll beat your brains out . " <P> Next year came last week for Duffy Daugherty 's Spartans . The 50,000-seat stadium at East Lansing , Mich , had been sold out since spring . Daugherty , 40 , the onetime Syracuse lineman who succeeded M.S.U. Head Coach " Biggie " Munn last year , had obviously put together a powerful team . Michigan State had lost only one game , a one-touchdown defeat by No. 1-rated University of Michigan . But Terry Brennan had an even better record . In three 1955 starts , the Irish were undefeated , untied and unscored upon . <P> From the outset , Michigan State was the superior team , stronger in tackling , blocking and ball handling . With a bewildering mixture of single-wing and T formations , the Spartans drove into Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fumble , then mounted another offensive that carried to the Notre Dame goal line . Notre Dame 's perfect record ended just as the second quarter began , when Halfback Clarence Peaks went over for the first M.S.U. touchdown . <P> Notre Dame 's Quarterback Paul Hornung , who has been only moderately successful with his passing so far this season , began throwing as soon as his team dropped behind . He tried five and completed three passes , the last one good for a tying touchdown . But it turned out to be the last Irish scoring play of the day . All through the second half , with every State man blocking explosively and tackling the Irish offensive into the ground , the Spartans dominated the play . Fullback Gerry Planutis bucked over early in the third quarter to put the Spartans in front again , and Quarterback Earl Morrall sneaked across with an insurance touchdown in the last period . Planutis , who missed two conversions in last year 's 20-19 game and opened the way for the Irish victory , made no mistakes this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dame was not the only favorite knocked off in the weekend 's games : Underdog Colgate put Princeton out of the unbeaten ranks , winning 15-6 for its first victory over the Tigers since 1925 . <P> Still dazed from the beating they took from Michigan the week before , favored Army could not get the ball across midfield until the final two minutes of play and was blanketed 13-0 by Syracuse . <P> Top-ranked Michigan won its game 14-2 , but lost prestige when it was outplayed by lowly Northwestern , which has not won a game this season . <P> Yale crossed Cornell 's goal line in the first minute and a half of play , then went on to score a 34-6 win , and rule as a clear favorite to top this year 's Ivy League .
