BITTER HONEYMOON ( 221 pp. ) - Alberto Moravia-Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy ( $3.50 ) . <P> The books and stories of Italy 's Alberto Moravia are battlegrounds , the troops men and women . No other living writer can make the battle of the sexes seem so grueling a fight to the finish . Bitter Honeymoon contains eight stories , and like most of Moravia 's writing they raise an interesting question about the author : Does he really know a lot about women , or is he just terribly afraid of them ? Probably the answer is : both . He knows them well enough to make male readers remember their own worst defeats , to convince women that he has no business exposing their most appalling characteristics . One thing is certain : to Moravia love and sex are indispensable tortures . <P> In the title story , the honeymooners are really duelists . This is their second day on Anacapri , and poor Giacomo has got nowhere . When he asks for a kiss , he gets a peck on the cheek . Simona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is somehow frightened or not really in love or both . To make matters worse , she is a Communist , and Giacomo is not at all interested in politics . When they run across one of Simona 's party pals , jealousy is added to discontent . That night , when the marriage is consummated , it is as though two well-meaning but puzzled strangers had finally agreed to agree for lack of anything better to do . <P> For Author Moravia , the ending of Bitter Honeymoon is an uncommonly tender solution . More typical is Back to the Sea . Here Lorenzo , the husband , is the tortured chap whose marriage is one continual snub from his wife . She does n't love him and never did . She has taken on a whole string of lovers . Lorenzo knows all this but knowing it only helps to heighten his infatuation . On a picnic by the sea , he tries to win her affection , then tries to take her by force , but he realizes that having her that way would really be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving him stranded , he goes wading along the shore that was a wartime beach and is blown up by a mine . This , Moravia seems to say , is more merciful all around . <P> So it goes . Sex is sickness , love is a torment . A lesser writer could not get away with such loaded dice , but Moravia is a first-rate craftsman and he can make the reader squirm along with his characters .
