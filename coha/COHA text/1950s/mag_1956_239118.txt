A MAN 'S ESTATE ( 279 pp. ) - Emyr Humphreys-McGraw-Hill ( $3.75 ) . <P> <P> Lloyd George knew my father , Father knew Lloyd George . <P> This song , sung to the tune of Onward , Christian Soldiers , was chorused by Welsh Laborites after World War I when they wanted to deride the chapel-bound piety of the Liberal Party , whose politicians were then riding high on the swallowtails of " the man who won the war . " <P> It might well be the theme of Emyr Humphreys ' fine novel . Elis Felix Elis , M.P. , once had Lloyd George for the weekend at his family home , the biggest house in Pennant , North Wales . But Elis died at 40 before this rich political promise could be fulfilled . In Pennant , whose wet , cobbled streets may remind readers of Dylan Thomas ' " Llareggub , " Elis left behind a poisoned Welsh rabbit of hatred , and a family-legitimate and illegitimate-hopelessly trying to evoke their true spirits by rapping on the tables of consanguinity . <P> The form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , <P> Nov. 28 , 1955 ) , i.e. , it centers on the funeral of a town 's leading citizen , and each character is permitted his own piece - but Novelist Humphreys gives an extra dimension , in compassion and poetry , which O'Hara 's cold-eyed approach denies him . <P> The main characters are Hannah Elis , bitter , spinster daughter of the late great M.P . She hates her grim , mustached mother and her cold , Bible-reading uncle-stepfather , who together run the biggest farm and shop and all the morals of Pennant . She longs for the love of Idris Powell , the young minister of the ruling chapel ; but he , alas , becomes disgracefully snarled up in an affair with her " chance-child " half sister , Ada Evans , a spirited young woman who never goes to chapel . In the end it is her brother Philip Esmor-Elis who liberates Hannah . He had been " sent away " at birth , returned hating the " sadistic Calvinists and hypocrites " of Pennant . He is an " intellectual barbarian " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to fall in love with the Welsh countryside and to acquire pity for his twisted sister . <P> There is madness , near incest , suicide and murder in this novel . Humphreys acquired a Welsh eloquence in Flintshire , North Wales , where he was born , and generously distributes it among his characters . And he has an ear for pitch that would make him a good judge at a bardic contest at an eisteddfod . His grim village of Pennant , however , will set no tourists searching for its actual counterpart .
