" Then I 'll file t-t-two suits , the second against y-y-you ! " Their next stop was the Todd home on Main Street . The house was dark and unendurable . Though evaluated at five thousand dollars , the bids were under three thousand because everyone knew it was a distress sale . It was not only the house that had changed , but the town as well : all gradual-emancipation men such as her father and Cassius Clay had been defeated in the election , and the pro-slavery men were in control . A curfew bell rang at seven and any slave found out after that hour was sentenced to thirty-five lashes ; no free Negro was allowed within the state 's borders . Because so many large slaveholders had died . intestate during the plague , hundreds of slaves were being sold on the block ; the legislature had repealed the Non-Importation Act which Robert Todd had worked so hard to get passed . The terrorized Negroes were running away , many committing crimes in their flight . Shootings of Negroes had grown apace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate . They went to the Phoenix Hotel for a light supper , then called on Cassius Clay , who was living in his elegant town house , nursed by his wife and mother . He had been contesting with a slavery man by the name of Turner a seat to the Kentucky Constitutional Convention when a son of his opponent had rushed forward , crying at Clay , " You 're a damned liar ! " Cassius had jumped off the platform and punched the young man , then had been hit over the head with a club and stabbed in the left breast . In turn Cassius had buried his bowie knife in the Turner boy 's abdomen . Cassius was given up for dead . Young Turner had died . Cassius received them in bed , his face thin and pale , his eyes enormous under the rounded brow . " Everyone thought I would die , Mary , but I relied on my natural vigor . Turner was elected , and now we have a new constitution which holds that the right of the slaveholder to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Tell me , Mr. Lincoln , much as the Union is to be loved , is it to be loved more than a national conscience ? If slavery is to be extended forever , I prefer dissolution of the Union to that ! " Mary always reacted faster than Abraham . " But , Cash , surely you do n't think the Union is in danger ? " " No , Mary , the south will raise the cry of dissolution merely to carry a point , the way boys muddy the water to catch lobsters . The north will cede any point rather than risk the Union ; but time will show you that liberty and slavery can not co-exist . " He turned in bed to ease the sharp pain that had misted his eyes . " We have twenty million men spread from sea to sea , without one man of greatness among them : this is the cause of my tears , Mary . "  |p201She  leaned over the bed , kissed Cassius on the forehead . " Perhaps you are that man , Cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary , your husband does n't agree with me . He believes the Union must be preserved at all costs . The south knows how you feel , Mr. Lincoln , and will make the north and the cause of freedom pay those costs . " Clay 's wife Mary Jane came into the room to quiet her husband . The Lincolns murmured their adieux . As they walked along the dark and now menacing streets Mary waited for Abraham to comment . He remained silent . Abraham reported to Mary that Robert Todd , instead of owning a large portion of the bank 's assets , was in debt for cash he had invested in various enterprises . Had he lived , he would have brought most of them to culmination , but now .. . They started for Buena Vista with heavy hearts . As they came up the road in the carriage they saw that the tall summer house already seemed run down . Betsy came out ; the two women were in each other 's arms . Mary said : " George is a mighty twisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for protecting our interests , " said Betsy . Then she asked in a tight voice , " What have I done that they should grow up hating me ? " Mary went through a swift sorting-out process . " It was n't you , Betsy , it was the situation ; we first children were a noisy , demanding brood . . . feeling that we came first , so were the most important . . . Betsy 's gaze softened . " I was always a little jealous of you , because you were your father 's favorite . " " I knew how lonely he was . I wanted Father to have you , to have love . . . that 's why he loved me more than the others . " The next morning a group of neighbors collected , the Tuckers , Hamiltons , Clearys , Youngs , Stuarts and several members of the Humphreys family from Frankfort , come to buy in some of the things Betsy valued the most ; and many strangers looking for bargains . The auction started in the kitchen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary stood with her stepmother , holding her icy hand , while her most intimate possessions were sold . When a pile of bath towels was set up for bidding , Mary felt a shudder go through Betsy ; these were towels the children used after their baths . " Bid them in , Betsy , " Mary whispered , and her stepmother did , paying six dollars and thirty cents for the lot ; then she mist into tears and left the room.  |p202The  auctioneer moved into the dining room where the good china set went to Thomas Gibson for twenty-eight dollars , the dining table for seventeen-fifty . The Humphreys family could stand it no longer and bought in Betsy 's preserve dishes , her extension table , vases , rocking chair , astral lamp . Mary bought for Betsy the two oil paintings that hung over the sideboard , several silver and glass dishes she knew Betsy loved . But neither she nor the Humphreys family could keep up with the relentless stripping process : the draperies , carpets , furniture , bric-a-brac . Mary was prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father had cherished , but one of the Humphreys rescued that , so she bought Betsy her favorite leather-bound volumes of poetry and travel . All of the Todd personal possessions brought nine hundred dollars : the beautiful furnishings , glassware , linens , books , art objects that had been brought from all over the world for thousands of dollars . Mary figured in her mind that as his compensation George would receive a little over sixty-five dollars ! She groaned aloud . The farm implements were auctioned under the locust trees , then the horses , hogs , geese and sheep . Wagons drew up to the back door , cash was paid , a long line of possessions began making its way down the dirt roads to other homes . The years that Robert and Betsy Todd . . . and Mary Todd . . . had lived in this house were irrevocably gone . THE operation on Robert 's eye was a success ; his eyes were moving normally in both directions . His features were good , and now he was quite handsome . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a group of boys , none of whom ever had seen him before . She thrilled to the happiness on her son 's face . Then Edward came down , though it was hardly more than a lassitude at first : his eyes dulled , his face was drawn . As she snuggled him on her shoulder she noticed that he was having difficulty breathing . When Abraham came home for dinner she asked him to drop by the Wallace home . William depressed Edward 's tongue , examined his throat . " His tonsils are red and mottled . Make a weak solution of chloride of lime and have him gargle frequently . " The next morning the boy had trouble swallowing . Dr. Wallace was there at seven . He said , " Abraham , go for Uncle Dr. Todd . I 'd like him to look at Edward 's throat . " Fear zigzagged through Mary 's insides.  |p203Their  uncle came puffing up the steps , divested himself of his greatcoat , put on his spectacles . She heard the doctors exchange phrases , " .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then her uncle ' said : " Looks like diphtheria , just starting . There have been several cases in town . " " Diphtheria ! " She felt herself pale . William dissolved twenty grains of nitrate of silver in an ounce of water , attached a sponge to a whalebone and applied it to Edward 's throat . Mary was to do the swabbing every four hours . By nightfall the diphtheria had taken full possession ; the disease raged for five days . Mary and Abraham hardly bothered to get out of their clothes , catching two or three hours ' sleep when the boy did not need their ministrations . She was a tireless nurse , carried out the medical regime intelligently , turned a calm face to her son . Her task was lightened by the boy 's sweet nature . The crisis passed . Abraham had been planning to buy Edward a regular boy 's bed for his fourth birthday in March . Mary exclaimed , " Why do n't we get it now ? I 'll clear out my sewing room upstairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like that . " Abraham went down to buy the bed . By the time it was delivered she had moved her form and patterns and bolts of material . Christmas and the New Year holidays went by without their knowing . Except when he had to appear before the courts , Abraham spent all his time with the boy . When after an eighteen-hour stretch Mary persuaded him to leave Edward 's side and come to bed , she would awaken in the blackness of the night to find that he had gone back to the sickroom , sitting on a hard chair with his eyes on his son 's peaked face . They were deep into the second month of convalescence when it again became difficult for Edward to swallow . Dr. Wallace found the child 's soft palate and pharynx paralyzed ; the following day his sight was affected , and in spite of the half dozen doctor friends who offered their aid , the paralysis spread to one whole side of his body . On the rainy morning of February r , after fifty-two days of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the ague , Mary got into bed and pulled the blankets over her head . Lightning cracked and thunder rolled into the house and into the bedroom , inside the bed and inside her body . She wept . brokenheartedly , as she never had wept in her life . " Our little fellow is gone . Oh , Abraham , what have we done that he should have suffered so ? " " The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away . He took our sweet little codger . He 'll give us more children . " The funeral was set for Sunday . Abraham awakened her early byp204bathing her face with a dampened towel , then holding her up in bed and pressing a cup of strong black coffee to her lips . " Drink this , my dear , it will give you strength . You must dress now . Reverend Dresser is out of the city , but Reverend Smith will conduct the services . You remember I was reading a copy of his book at your father 's house in Lexington . He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She fell out of his arms . His own cheeks were sunken , his eyes buried deep under crags of suffering . " Mary , you must get up . The carriage is waiting . " " I . . . ca n't . . . go . " She closed her eyes . Silence came . When she opened them he loomed there , dark and brooding . " You must come , Mary . You 'll want to say good-bye to Eddie . " " I 've already said good-bye . . . ten thousand times . Oh , Abraham , please do n't make me go . . . to see them put him in the ground ... I could n't bear it . " He persisted no further . She heard the front door close , a carriage drive away . She fell into a fever in which nightmares mixed with delirium . She slept , then would spring up , thinking she had heard Edward call . Chills swept across her , raking her body with cold fire . At the end of a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the second she was in the kitchen doing a few salutary chores ; and on the next Sunday morning she went with her husband to the First PresbyterianChurch to hear the Reverend James Smith preach . The minister was a large stalwart-looking Scotsman . He spoke with tenderness about death , particularly of little ones , and of the solace to be derived from faith . The pain eased , the grief crumbled at the edges . IF their outside interests had vanished , she was at least grateful that Abraham could spend his evenings at home . He would return early , carrying a piece of beefsteak in brown paper , hang his coat on the hatrack , exposing the galluses that held up his trousers , divest himself of his heavy boots . She watched him stalk through the house and sit down to supper in his stockinged feet ; her efforts to improve his domestic manners had fallen on infertile soil , the log-cabin habits refusing to be polished out of the rough diamond . Afterwards he turned a chair upside down , sprawledp205out on the sitting-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she asked him why he read aloud , he replied : " It 's because I learned to read in a blab school . I do n't understand what I 'm reading unless I speak it out loud and hear it in my own ear . " Each week he would bring home a new book of humor , such as Joe Viller 's Jests . He would call across the room : " How many legs will a sheep have if you call a tail a leg ? " " Five . " " Wrong ; calling a tail a leg do n't make it so . " He brightened many a lonely hour . She turned to Robert , hoping to get from him some of the affection Edward had given so spontaneously . But Robert had established his independence . Had he never forgiven them for his crossed eyes and for the humiliation that had scarred his early years ? Once when Robert was defying her in cold , hostile fashion she picked up a stick she had been using to stir her ash barrel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim out into the yard , Abraham said with sadness : " Mary , Mary . " Wanting to lighten her burden , he added , " Corporal punishment is wasted on the young . " When they bought the Reverend Dresser 's house they had stood almost alone on the outskirts of town ; now some twenty homes had been constructed on Eighth and Ninth , Jackson and Edwards streets . Just across Jackson Street lived the sheriff , Charles Arnold , and next to him Abner Watson , the county constable , so that she figuratively could look into the kitchen window of the law . Behind them , across the alley , were two lively families each with a number of youngsters , the Sam Graveses , whose little boy Hobart had been Edward 's playmate , and William Billington , a civil engineer . Benjamin Moore , the city surveyor , had built a house close by . There was a group of children who played together . Mary cleared out the barn and let it he known that it could be used as headquarters for their club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart sank when she saw him taking valuable materials and furniture from the house to be used as props , but she was determined to pay any price to win the boy 's acceptance . One afternoon there was a howling of dogs from the barn , the noisewas maddening ; she bit her lip , did nothing to interfere . A little whilelater she heard hurried steps in the street , saw Abraham vault the all Fence , run through the yard , pick up a stave of an old ash barrel and speed across the yard to the barn . There were frantic sounds of running and one short cry . In a few moments he came onto the back porch , carrying the barrel stave in his hand , an outraged expression on his face.  | " Why did n't you stop them , Mary ? Why did a neighbor have to make me come all the way home from the office ? How can you be so indifferent as to let them hang dogs in the barn ? " " Hang dogs ? Whatever are you talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulling a friend by the hand . The little fellow was crying . He ran to Mary . " Everybody was bigger than me . . . they got through the hole in the wall . Mr. Lincoln hit me . " Robert protested : " We were putting on a dog act is all , teaching the dogs how to stand up on their hind legs . They did n't want to learn so we had ropes around their necks and we were helping to hold them up . Then Papa came in screaming , What do you mean by hanging dogs ? ' " Mary looked sideways at her husband and , imitating his voice , murmured , " Abraham , Abraham ! Corporal punishment is wasted on the young ! Shoo now , Mr. Lincoln , you 've spoiled the dog act , so you ca n't stay for the taffy pull . " That afternoon while Robert was helping to clean out the taffy tubs , his cheek brushed against hers in a gesture of friendliness . Happiness warmed her heart . And that night , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to embrace her husband with the fullness of her love . Within a few weeks she discovered she was pregnant . " Abraham , " she asked , " you 've been reading Euclid 's Geometry lately , what are our mathematical chances of getting a daughter this time ? " She gave a small dinner party for the Simeon Francises , who were trying to sell the journal , for Julia Jayne , who had married Judge Lyman Trumbull and was living in Alton , for the Orville Brownings , who had been . trying for ten years to get elected to Congress with no success . Abraham still carried his office in his tall stovepipe hat ; when she asked him a question about their personal affairs he would dump dozens of letters and scraps of paper out of the hat onto a table and go looking for the information . She rarely asked about their income ; no books were kept in the office , Abraham seldom knew how much they were earning . When money came to him for legal fees he would divide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his partner , put the other half in his pocket . When he wanted to visit a neighboring county seat for a few days he was obliged to write to a friend asking him please to collect a fifty-dollar fee that was owed to him as , " I am short of money . " When the fifty dollars did not arrive he told her : " If you run short you can always go down to Billy Herndon , and he will give you my half of whatever fees came in , " She grimaced.  |p207The  next morning while the house was sunk in predawn sleep there was a pounding on the front door . Abraham answered it in his yellow flannel nightshirt , which was held together by one button at the neck . When he returned he began to dress hurriedly. . . a client .. . apparently tried to suck all the whiskey barrels intown . . . broke up a grocery . . . I got to keep him out of jail . " He returned at eight o'clock . " Who called you down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she handed him a plate of eggs and sliced smoked ham . He fastened his eyes on the food . " . . . there were four of them . . . your cousin Logan 's son , for one . " " Why did n't cousin Logan get his son out of jail ? " Abraham 's Adam 's apple moved up and down in his scrawny neck while he tried to get himself to tell another half-truth . It would n't work . Lifting upi his eyes , he said dryly , " It was n't young Logan who sent for me . It was Billy . " " Billy ! You mean Mr. Herndon ? He was in this drunken brawl ? " " Yes . " " I hope the judge gives him six months in jail ! " " Oh , I got them all out . . . by putting up enough to repair the grocery . " She brought her eyebrows together . " Where did you get the cash to bail out four drunks ? " " I called on Jacob Bunn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled for him . Since he 's become the town banker I told him to hold it for me . " He laid down his knife and fork . " I wanted to leave it there . .. for an emergency . " She was angry now , " And Billy Herndon 's brawls are to be the emergenciesfor which our money is saved ? " " We all have weaknesses , If I got into trouble through one of my weaknesses , Billy would pay my costs . That 's what friendship means , Mary . " She sank into a chair at the kitchen table , tears of exasperation in her eyes . " There are times when I think you love him more than you do me . " " Now , Mary , I love Billy as my partner ; I love you as my wife . 1 try to be a good friend to both of you . " He grinned weakly . " If you got drunkand broke up a grocery store , I 'd bail you out too . " She shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her forehead and cheeks . " That 's a mighty Christian sentiment , Mr. Lincoln ! "  |p208SHE  knew that he went to visit his family in Coles County once a year , and wondered why he did not at least invite to Springfield his stepmother , to whom he seemed devoted . She remembered how upset he had been in Washington when he had received two letters , one from his father and one from his stepbrother John Johnston , Sarah Bush Lincoln'sson by her first marriage , both asking for money . To his father he had replied that he cheerfully sent him the twenty dollars which sum Thomas Lincoln said was necessary to save his land from sale , even though he knew the story to be untrue ; but to his stepbrother he wrote that he did not think it best to comply with his request for an eighty-dollar loan , proposing instead that Johnston go to work " tooth and nails for some body who will give you money for it , " promising that for every dollar he earned Abraham would give him another . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesion of the heart , she was hard pressed to understand why he did not leave at once for the Coles County farm ; the explanation came three days later in another letter which explained that Thomas Lincoln had simply had a lot of phlegm on his lungs , from which he was now entirely relieved . She thought of her own brothers George and Levi : what family was not complex , obliged to carry its membersfrom station to station as a living cross ? Nor had he once since the painful revelation of his mother 's illegitimacy spoken of her . While they were in Washington he had communicated with various Lincolns , trying to find out if they were related to his grandparents ; but on the subject of his mother 's family and the question of her totally unknown father he maintained silence . The original joy with which she had welcomed her pregnancy turned to ennui . Did her backaches and constant awareness of the child result from fatigue , or were they due to fear that forces beyond her control might strike her down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring of 185o was a mild one , wild flowers splashed the prairies with color , the local life of Springfield was peaceable , yet the threat of disunion completely dominated the air . His fearful forebodings filled the house as he read to her the heightening of the slavery conflict as reported in the Washington National Intelligencer , the New York Herald , Congressional Globe , Charleston Mercury and Richmond Enquirer . True , the best minds of the country were working for compromise : if the south would vote to admitp209California as a free state , then the north would vote for a fugitive slave law with the federal government returning runaway slaves to their owners ; if the south would vote for the admission of New Mexico and Utah as territories without constitutional sanctioning of slavery , the north would admit the new territories without slavery being legally prohibited . But John Calhoun , parental voice of the south , denounced compromise , urging the southern states to withdraw from the Union ; the abolitionist voices of the north , even that of Horace Greeley in the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south be severed from the Union . He gazed up from the sea of newspapers surrounding him on the floor and cried : " ... I failed in Washington . . . if I could be there now I could raise my voice . . . help bring the north and south extremists a little closer together . As it is , I have no place to make myself heard . . . and President Taylor is going to bring on civil war , my life upon it ! Did I do everything in my power to see that General Taylor was put into the White House so that President Taylor can bring the country to the verge of dissolu-tion ? " With the widely published statement that it was not merely the southern politician who wanted disunion , but the southern people as a whole , and the calling of an all-southern conference in Nashville with the avowed intent to set up an independent Republic of the South , a dead-ash winter sky seemed to lower over the horizon , blotting out the bright spring sun . This aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace ordered her to bed . For her , the conflict over secession was no academic dispute : her roots were in Kentucky , and Kentucky was a slave state , its legislature dominated by pro-slavery men . Any attempt by the north to hold the southern states in the Union by force meant that Kentucky would be in the war , her brothers Levi and George , her half brothers Samuel and David , the hundreds of her blood kin fighting against the Todd , Logan , Stuart , Wallace , Edwards and Lincoln boys of Springfield . Having grown up with many planters who were protective to their slaves , and who faced ruin without them , she understood the blind fury of those who were in danger of being stripped of their lifetime earnings by outsiders who knew little of their problem ; while at the same time , having been raised by a father who favored emancipation , having been moved from childhood by Cassius Clay 's determination that slavery must go , she understood the spiritual abhorrence of the abolitionists who felt that in helping sustain slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Her only source of comfort was that she and Abraham agreed on the slavery issue ; with the congressional storms beating about their heads , with their friends agitated and quarreling , with her own omnipresentp210physical fears , she did not know how she would have endured had she and Abraham been split on this basic moral problem . At the end of three weeks she insisted that she had to cook a few digestiblemeals for her family , clean the house of the dirt left by the three servants , each of whom she had kept one week . On the Fourth of July Abraham left for Chicago to attend the United States District Court . A few hours after his departure word reached Springfieldthat President Taylor was down with cholera . Abraham once had asked , " How do we save ourselves from a man who does n't understand that he 's president equally of all the people , of all the sections and all the states , and as the father of all his children he can not help one by destroying another ? " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderate man , was inaugurated . Mary learned with satisfaction that former Congressman Lincoln , who had withdrawn from politics , had been invited by the Whig party of Chicago to deliver the eulogy on the dead president , and had not felt free to decline . By the time he returned , toward the end of the month , a new political climate had settled over the country . Henry Clay 's Compromise Omnibus bill had been defeated not only by the Democrats but by Whig President Taylor , who feared that a victory for Clay meant that the senator from Kentucky would be the next president of the United States . Wanting to preserve the peace , President Fillmore now declared in favor of the Compromise . There was lacking only a new leader to come forth and take command . Out onto the stage stepped the chairman of the Committee on Territories , none other than their old friend and adversary , Stephen Douglas . " It 's funny how that little man always lands on his feet , " exclaimed Mary , her expression caught between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the Committee on Territories was of great importance , yet today the chairman of that committee holds the fate of the Union in his hands . How does he do it , Abraham ? " " The Little Giant has a genius for being at the right place at the right moment . . . just like me ! " He gave an ironic toss of his shoulder . " I 'll wager you this : if Douglas is successful in bringing out of his committee , a series of bills which will get California , New Mexico and Utah admitted peaceably , he 'll be the biggest man in our country . It will make him number one with the Democrats , and put him in line for the presidential nomination in ' 52 . " " Abraham , you ca n't be serious ! " She was aghast . " He 's been in the Senate only three years . How can he have taken over the party y , quickly ? " She was glad that Abraham did not answer ; the question she really hadp211wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far when we have come up so short ? Swiftly Stephen Douglas took control of the Congress : organizing , whippingrecalcitrant factions into line , stripping Clay 's Omnibus and separatingits parts into individual measures , each of which could pass by musteringfriends behind it . The sum total of all the passing was a compromise which could satisfy the majority of both the north and the south and once again , as with the Missouri Compromise of 182o , give them a chance to live without strife . The only shocking aspect was the harsh fugitive slave law . Abraham spread his arms wide , then dropped them hard against his sides , like a man who had pondered these matters long and fruitlessly . Peace descended upon Springfield , and upon the United States . Wise and moderate men had prevailed . Standing in the center of the landscape , bigger than life , bigger even than the Executive Mansion , stood Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois : the single greatest cohesive force in Washington . In the streets , in the shops , in the homes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stephen Douglas will be the next president of the United States . " " He picked up the pieces the old giants could n't assemble , " agreed Abraham ; " he saved us from disunion . That talent for organization is what kept beating us Illinois Whigs for the past ten years . " He left again for the circuit swing . She was in her seventh month , with a great sense of heaviness . The kitchen became the sitting room , she and Robert eating their meals before the warm stove , remaining there until bedtime with spelling book and sewing basket . Since Abraham 's defeat for the Land Office he had been lethargic about national affairs and the debates in Congress ; now with the passing of the Compromise measure he sank back once again into political apathy . The trip would be good for him . He was happy with his fellow lawyers . She knew the excitement of court days in the Illinois towns when the county folk came to foregather and foreclose . The taverns and coffeehouses would be filled , whole families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who followed the courts . Abraham still was happiest with men . It was not only the excitement of the courtroom , the spontaneity of cases he had to organize by a few moments ' reading of the papers , but the hilarity as well , with nearly threehundred-poundJudge David Davis leaning down from the crude bench saying , " Mr. Lincoln , how does that strike you ? " and Abraham , as befittedthe official humorist of the Eighth Circuit , giving back a story which would send the court into gales of laughter . The night sessions in the hotel room of judge Davis , always the best in the tavern , Abraham relished even more ; here the lawyers held their mock court , satirizing what hadp212happened in the day 's cases , with the stories , the bottle , the singing going the rounds until midnight . There was the time Abraham refused to join the firm of " Catch ' em and Cheat ' em " : upon arriving at Danville , one of his young partners brought him the case of a demented girl with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of being saved from what the town described as a " designing adventurer . " Abraham won the case for the girl in twenty minutes . Upon learning that his partner charged her a $250 fee , he obliged him to return half of the money . Judge David Davis summoned Abraham to the bench , and said in a rasping whisper which could be heard to the other end of the public square , " Lincoln , you are impoverishing this bar by your picayune charges of fees , and the lawyers have reason to complain of you . You are now almost as poor as Lazarus , and if you do n't make people pay you more for your services you will die as poor as Job 's turkey . " That night the lawyers assembled while the judge tried Abraham before his orgmathorial court , found him guilty and fined him two dollars for his " awful crime against the pockets of his brethren at the bar . " Nor did the hardships faze him : the muddy roads across the prairies , the uneatable food , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shabby buggy behind his bay horse , Buck , he would study Euclid and books on invention in the jogging silence . He enjoyed the handling of hundreds of cases , winning for his clients , counseling the young lawyers who came to him for advice , taking Judge Davis 's place on the bench for a day or two when the judge could not preside . The house was silent during the day , with Abraham on circuit and Robert away at school . There were times when , resting in bed , browsing or daydreaming , it seemed as though she were a young girl back in her bedroom in Lexington , excited at being voted the most popular girl at Mentelle 's , living in an atmosphere of fun and gaiety . Everything that had happened in the interval had been a dream : she had never come to Springfield , never met Abraham Lincoln , never married , borne two sons and Iost one of them , aspired to the heights , fallen , Then the child within her would stir , the dream recede before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THEIR third son was an amazing replica of Edward . She con tracted childbed infection , ran a fever of 104  --  ; it was a full month beforep213she was able to get out of bed . In gratitude for Dr. Wallace 's constant care , they named the boy William Wallace Lincoln . She found Abraham pacing the house , his head down , hands clasped behind his back . " It 's my stepbrother again : he 's written me two letters telling me that my father is desperately ill , and that I must come at once . Here 's a third letter , accusing me of being uninterested in my family . You know that 's not true , I desire that neither Father or Mother should be in want of any comfort in health or sickness , and I 'm sure they have not failed to use my name to procure a doctor or anything else that my father might need . " He wrote to his stepbrother : I sincerely hope Father may yet recover his health . Say to him that if we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more painful than pleasant . A few days later , when Abraham received news that Thomas Lincoln had died , she saw that he was not so much distressed by the death as by the fact that he could feel so little over it . She was surprised to find her husband , like her sisters , unforgiving . At the end of January she left the house for an Episcopal fund-raising supper in the Supreme Court . She had baked as her contribution a three-layer jelly cake , which Abraham carried on a silver platter to the church ladies . In celebration of the birth of their son , he took her to a ball at the courthouse , and to see the Robinson Family in Maid of Munster . Much of the odoriferous Chicken Row had been torn down , with threestorybrick buildings going up in its place ; Jacob Bunn had opened Springfield'sfirst private bank ; and it was now illegal for hogs to run the streets . " Apparently the hogs are taking that law seriously , " Mary commented as they made a tour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against her skirts . Abraham 's business was slow , though he was retained by the Alton and Sangamon Railroad to attend the legislative sessions and watch any railroadbills that might be introduced . He came home for supper at five , washed in the basin on the back porch , ate his shrimp creole or Susquehannashad , played with the baby . " We must not show too much of our love for William , " Mary cautioned ; " Robert is too young to understand that part of our feeling is grati-tude .... " Abraham no longer read the new books being published , but when Robert led his class in Latin , he started studying with the boy . In the evenings he was restless , more and more often ended his pacing by putting on his boots , stock and coat and going downtown to the Supreme Courtp214library where the lawyers and legislators congregated , She thought it inconsiderate of him to go out night after night , leaving her alone in the house with the two children , but she was too proud to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball which was held in the new ballroom over the post office , as well as for the Robinson Family in What 's in a Name ? Her friend Julia Jayne Trumbull came in from Alton and Mary invited thirty couples to dinner . When return invitations were received Abraham groused about getting too much social life ; she ignored his grumbling . At the end of March when he prepared to leave on his ten-week ride around the Eighth Judicial Circuit she was reluctant to have him go . " Abraham , why ca n't you split the circuit with Mr. Herndon ? " " Billy is just no good at circuit riding ; I get four times the amount of business . Besides , he 's miserable on circuit ; he insists on staying home with his family , " She thought , And you do n't ; that 's why I 'm left without any husband six months out of the year . The town was filled with wagon trains heading for California ; she grew timid about being left alone in the house . Frequently she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard Powel , twelve-yearoldfriend of Robert 's , if he would sleep upstairs in Robert 's room until Mr. Lincoln returned ; he agreed to do so for five cents a night . She expected Abraham for a visit at the end of the second week , or the third at the latest , but these week ends passed and the fourth and fifth as well . She ran out of money . When Abraham did not come in by Friday afternoon of the sixth week she was forced to go down to the office . She dressed to the teeth in her newest , a striped pink alpaca falling over large hoops , with a deep rose knitted shawl , and climbed the stairs to the Lincoln-Herndon office . William Herndon rose from the lone desk by pushing himself upward on his hands . They stood staring at each other over an unbridgeable chasm , he with one eye closed as though to see her better . In the passing instant she noted that his hair and half-length eyebrows still were jet black . She turned away and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T , well carved by a jackknife , the four or five cane-bottomed chairs and long rickety sofa propped against the wall , the rear windows thick with dirt , the floor unswept , plants growing in a corner where Abraham had dumped the seeds he had brought hack from Washington . She pulled in her lips with a gesture of distaste , remembering hoer her father 's office had been scrubbed every morning before he reached it , how beautifully decorated it had been with its French wallpaper , hunting prints , desk and chairs tooled by Lexington 's finest furniture makers . Shep215sighed ; that was another world , another civilization , really . Reluctantly she brought her eyes back to Mr. Herndon . " Mr. Lincoln told me to come here for money belonging to him . " She had not known her tone would be icy until she herself heard it . " You have some , no doubt ? " Herndon opened the bottom drawer on the right-hand side of the desk , indicating a number of paper packages , a few of them tied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fee . Help yourself . " She stared at him for another moment , strongly tempted to turn on her heel and go out through the filthy office and down the stairs without taking the money for which she had come . Red in the face and furious at herself , she reached down , picked up a handful of the little packages , dropped them in a shopping bag , swept aside her full skirts and strode out in silence . Abraham appeared at noon the next day , bringing with him two hundreddollars in cash . She was smarting from the painful scene of the day before , and from the fact that she had had no word from him for nine weeks . When he leaned down to kiss her she turned her cheek sideways . " This makes me a little impatient , " rebuked Abraham . " I did not make the long journey just to argue the week end away . " Each lay rigidly at the far side of the bed ; Mary so close to the edge she thought she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , Molly , let 's not stay in a pet . " They made it up . Summer began early , hot and sticky . Cholera struck , with several quick deaths . Mary tried to keep Robert in the house , but his cries rocked the walnut planks of the walls . The only pleasant part of the oppressive season was that Abraham was doing well in the Springfield session of the United States Circuit Court ; he had a number of important cases of a business nature , with correspondingly higher fees . He loaned out three hundred dollars to Daniel E. Ruckel at ten per cent , and took a mortgage for six hundred dollars against the Thomas Cantrall eighty-acre farm . " Abraham , why do n't we buy land with our savings ? " she asked . " You 've told me about judge Davis and Leonard Swett buying land in all these new townships and getting rich off it . " " Ah well , getting rich . . . " He tousled his hair . " I am not a speculator , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had money coming in from investments , you would n't have to stay out on the circuit the full three months . A lot of the lawyers are riding only half the time , " she added plaintively . " In order to make money , Mary , you have to think of it pretty constantly . I 'd rather not tie myself down . I 'm a lawyer , I should make my money from the law . I have no talent for business . "  |p216There  was nothing more she could say . By the second week of September he was gone again for the swing which would last until the end of November . He assured her that he would get home when he could , but a number of the lawyers of the county seats were now saving their most important briefs for him to write when he arrived , and this meant working straight through the week ends . She found a tall red-haired , blue-eyed , freckle-faced Irish girl who had just arrived in Springfield and was looking for a home . Mary cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a good worker . It was comforting to have another adult in the house . She received no letters from Abraham , only an occasional message carried by one of the Springfield lawyers returning home for a week end . When he did not return by the seventh week end and she knew by actual count that every other lawyer touring the Eighth Circuit had returned at least once to he with his family , she not only missed him but grew ashamed . Nor was there any possibility of keeping her humiliation a secret ; the lawyers who traveled the circuit were close friends , their families knew of each other 's doings . She could not conceal the fact that she alone had not received a visit from her husband ; there certainly was no chance to keep the embarrassment from her sisters . Was he too busy ? tired ? in-different ? In the early months of their marriage Abraham had been the only lawyer to ride the sixty long miles for a Saturday afternoon and Sunday with his wife ; then she had been proud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks of November were a torture ; her headaches returning , she lay awake wide-eyed and miserable , spelled out each of the remaininghours : Abraham was in Shelbyville , some fifty miles away , perhapstoo long a trip to make , but on the following week end he was only thirty-five miles away in Decatur , not too far to come home had he wanted to , At the end of the tenth week she came to the conclusion that her husband had been cruel to her and to their sons . If he had been sensitive . if he had been kind , he would have made the journey home for their sakes . He arrived just before noon of a washday , with the house smelling of soapsuds and steam . She saw him drive through the back-alley gate , the buggy , the horse and Abraham covered the same dust gray . She was in her morning dress with her hair piled on top of her head . She made no effort to change or pretty herself . When he walked through the yard and up the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could n't have arrived at a more opportune time . . . for soiled linen . "  |p217He  stared at the rear outline of a huge girl with red arms and parboiled fingers hanging out wash on a flapping clothesline . Mary commented simply that Robert was in school , William in bed with the colic . " He 's contrary that way , never gets the colic except washdays . What have you got in that brown paper , Abraham , a string of pearls for me ? " " A beefsteak . " The beefsteak came out raw at one end , burned at the other ; the tea tasted bewitched ; and when she sat down at the table she saw that the tablecloth was wrong side out , the bread had too much saleratus and the milk was sour . She felt there was a kind of rudimentary justice in all this . SOME part of her husband had not returned , or at least was not present in the Eighth Street house . There was little joy in him , or excitement . The dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read Stephen Douglas 's big speech before the United States Senate . She told him about the new books she had bought during his absence , read him what she thought to be interesting paragraphs ; he nodded gravely and sat . in silence . When Harriet Beecher Stowe 's Uncle Tom 's Cabin was publishedin book form Mary gulped the first of the two volumes in a single sitting ; when she handed it to Abraham he merely glanced at the frontispiece , a woodcut of a Negro cabin , then put the book aside without turning a page . When she attempted to bring him up to date on the news of Springfield he listened with one ear open to her , the other opened inward to his own competing voice . Could it be disappointment with the results of the trip ? He assured her that he had had no failures aside from a case or two which he was confidentwould be reversed in a higher court . Then what had caused him to turn to some dark winter cave of disenchantment ? Certainly it was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten weeks ; apparently it never had occurred to him that she might be aggrieved by his staying away . Could it be that he had been gay and vital during the ten weeks of the thousand-mile circuit ride , and that coming home seemed dull or meaningless ? But why should thisbe true ? He loved his wife , he loved his children , he loved his home . . or so he said . How did she treat a husband who seemed perfectly well , even affectionate when affection was asked of him , but whose paddle wheel apparently had stopped turning ?  |p218The  following Sunday morning as she was returning from church she saw Abraham ahead of her , pulling a wagon with year-old William in it . As she crossed Market Street , William fell out of the wagon , landed on the hard-packed dirt walk and set up a tremendous howling . However it was not loud enough to break in on the thoughts of his father , for Abraham continued to pull the empty wagon to the corner , his head down on his chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit , picked up the child , quieted him . By the time she accomplished this Abraham had turned at the corner and was coming toward her . When he came to where she was standing , legs apart , blocking his passage , he was astonished to find that William was in her arms and not in his wagon . " Mr. Lincoln , if I had a shillalah , and I could reach up that high , I 'd break it over your head to wake you . How far away do you go in your mind that you do n't know your own baby has fallen out of the wagon ? " " It 's a hard world , Mary , " he said sadly , " people are forever falling out of wagons . Willie might just as well get used to it . " He was busy in one Springfield court or another , had won a case for banker Jacob Bunn as well as two cases for the Alton and Sangamon Railroad , but his mood remained subdued . When he sat in absolute silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commented , " A little sprightly conversation might improve the taste of that roast beef , " he looked up at her blankly , as though he had forgotten that she was sitting across the table from him , or that he was home at the family board . She realized anew the enormous hole that was left when politics dropped out of their lives , how much of their waking time had been devoted to study and discussion of the current issues . Though he was appointed a member of the Whig State Committee on Resolutions , and was asked to help select delegates to the Whig national convention , his participation was dispirited . When Ninian Edwards bolted the Whig party and aligned with the Democrats , the first apostate in their circle , Abraham was too disinterested to become upset . Where he used to take her to meetings two and three times a week , now the only one they attended was Orville Browning'slecture on the dignity of labor , at the Presbyterian church . It was a bitterly cold night , nineteen degrees below zero ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hot drink while they continued their discussion of wage scales and protection against unemployment and old age . He would have to leave again during the first week of April . If she did not tell him how hard the separation was on her nerves and health , could she consider him neglectful ? But could she handle it with humorHemust not become resentful , feel put upon . " Abraham , I hope you 're not going to work so hard you 'll come homep219that terribly rich businessman you tell me you do n't want to be ? " " Small fees , small change . " " Why not arrange to take off two or three half weeks ? You 'll be able to use some fresh linen . . . and a digestible meal . . . ? " Her voice had a bantering note ; he rose to it . " They tell me home cooking is the best . " His voice became flat again . " But sometimes the cases go over to Friday or Saturday ; I ca n't ride fifty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poor dear , now I know why they call you Old Abe : " He flushed , turned his eyes away from hers . " Do something daring , Abraham , skip one whole court , say at Danville or Paris . That 'll bring you home for a week in the middle of May . We 'll not miss the few dollars . " " It is n't only the money . . . people are expecting me . . . lawyers , clients , it would n't be fair to disappoint them . " " Would it be fair to disappoint me ? " Her voice had risen . " Or your two sons ? " She waited until the emotion in her chest moved downward . " I 'm sorry I spoke sharply , but I do n't believe you know how difficult it is for us to have you gone so long ; what can I tell Robert when he says , Cousin Stuart or Logan is home , or Ben Edwards , why does n't my father come ? ' Can I tell him we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less ? " He flinched . She reproached herself ; yet he had been so unmovable . " Very well , Mary , I 'll come home . I ca n't say just when . . . whenever there 's a short calendar . " She turned away , weary from the encounter . " If you feel you must stay out , do so ; we 'll manage to survive . " And so he left , in the shabby buggy behind Buck , the green umbrella on the seat beside him , his plug hat on his head , the old blue circular cloak from Washington over his shoulders , one trouser leg tucked into the boot . She did not have to wait to know that there would be no short calendar , no week or even day rescued from the passing spring months . HE returned toward the middle of June , walking up from the square late one afternoon with a carpetbag in his hand , having left the horse and buggy at a downtown stable . Mary was in her rocker by the sitting-room window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor with an india-rubber air ball . She was pale and thin , the two lines on the right side of her face had deepened , the strangerp220behind her eyes was her constant companion . She saw him coming up Eighth Street , his long thin figure moodily morose as he moved slowly toward the house . She sat quietly for a moment , thinking , This must be the gloomiest man in the world ! Can there be anything harder for a wife to bear ? She waited in the hallway for him to come up the front steps . As he reached for the knob she opened the door . Standing before her was the Abraham Lincoln of November 1840 who had returned with the election ballots from Lawrenceville , as composite a picture of misery as ever she had seen . Now as then his left eye was high up under the eyelid , his face a pattern of twisted torture lines , his skin sallow , his lips dry and ash gray . Then , he had been out for weeks campaigning for . Harrison for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he would gain an importantplace ; a few nights later he had come to her house to tell her that she must release him . Now , as he stood before her in the open doorway with deep blue rings and intricate ridges of wrinkles under his eyes , sagging at the hips , fatigue and despair carved in every line of him , she asked herself : What terrible defeat has he suffered this time ? What has he come home to tell me ? After supper , when he had read a story to Robert , and played with William before putting him to bed , they sat side by side in their big rockers before the unlighted hearth , no communication between them . A question lodged in her throat : Why do you look this way ? Finally she started to talk ; she told him how she had taken the sacrament and joined the First Presbyterian Church , but did not reveal how sorely she had needed the consolation of the church . She told of buying Dr. Jayne 's chest of family medicines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did not add that little William had been sick and in pain for a number of days , that the boy had called for his father . When she told him that she had taken the children to every entertainment that came to town , to the Older Circus which featured Mademoiselle Marietta the first lady equestrian , to see the Fakir of Siva who gave a magic show at the courthouse , she did not add that she was trying to compensate for their father 's neglect . When she related that she had bought a fourteen day French mantel clock from Seth Thomas , gilt china dishes and pickle shells from Wright and Brown , cashmeres and silks from Ninian Edwards 's store , she did not trouble to justify her extravagance on the grounds that there were times when she had been so despondent that she had rushed out of the house to shop , buying anything and everything in sight to relieve the heaviness of heart . When she told him that she went to a hall with Helen and Ben Edwards and to a sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not tell him that it was because the whole town was buzzing with the gossip that Abraham Lincoln did not come home any more . The Todds had no real defense against a defeat that everyone knew about . Ironically , for the first time he was earning sizable sums of money , enough for them to be comfortable . What had caused this depression , this full-fledged bout of hypo that could not be cured by rest , good food , a comfortable bed and financial security ? When she worked in the kitchen he tilted a chair against the wall , his feet on the lower rung , hands clasped about his knees , eyes sad , the picture of gloom . Thus absorbed , he would sit for hours defying interruption . Then suddenly he would throw back his head , tell her a story . At other times he would bolt out of the chair , stalk out of the room . . . or out of the house . She began to see little of him ; Sundays he spent at the office playing chess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that dinner was ready . She did not resist this , for in his absence he seemed more vivid to her than in his presence . When he came home at the end of the day he sat stony-silent before the hearth for four hours at a time , his head sunk deep on his chest , as immobile as a man withdrawn into death , He was taciturn , shut-mouthed , projecting nothing outside himself , alive by such a remote spark that often she could not hear or feel him when he came into a room . She had no clue to what he might be thinking during these long stretches of abstraction ; for that matter , she asked herself , was he thinking at all , or simply plunged into a morass of melancholy ? When it was time for sleep she put down her book or sewing but he kept his candle lit and read all night : in Burns , or a philosophy book William Herndon had loaned him , or poems of despair : Holmes 's Last Leaf ; Mortality ; the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , how one can sleep in the same bed with a man , yet have him be a thousand miles away . Early one morning she was awakened by strange noises : Abraham was sitting on the edge of the bed mumbling to himself . She listened closely , but his words were incoherent . After a few moments he rose from the bed , put on his trousers , socks and shirt , then dropped into the little chair before the hearth and sat gazing abstractedly into the cold fireplace . She sank back onto her pillow , her heart pounding in her chest . She cried to herself , Why ? Our failure has not been that great ! Our end is not in sight ! We have committed no unpardonable crime ! She ached as she had during the twenty months after Abraham had abandoned her . Now she had a husband , two children , a home , but her suffering was more intense , the failure cut deeper , the impending tragedyp222loomed greater . Then she had been a young girl , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Should she lose the love of her husband she was doomed to a fragmentary existence . The hot airless summer days were much like that earlier period , but she was eleven years older ; there were accumulated fatigues , scars : the death of Edward , the end to their public career and ambitions ; she no longer could pull the blankets over her head , hide herself from the world . Abraham was not being intentionally unkind , he tried sometimes to take certain burdens from her , but the basic burden , himself , he could do nothing about . How did she avoid being smothered by the oppressive weight ? She shook her head in despair . Was n't this what she could have expected from a man who was capable of deserting her on an engagementweddingclay ? Such a man must have other periods when he would be unable to accept the situation into which he had worked himself , and flee into melancholia . She had imagined that her troubles had arisen from his fear of marriage . . . Yet a man 's basic nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flee to some tragic tower within himself , the changing fortunes of life always would create the milieu . Though unable to fathom the why of what he was doing to himself , she did not question the extent of his misery or lose sympathy with him . But they were young , energetic , able . Why had he created this unhappiest period of their marriage because they were momentarily stranded in a backwash ? She did not care how long she had to wait ; but to be planning and working toward nothing . . . that was living death . Nor was it much consolation that he was treating the rest of the world as he did his wife : on the street he would look directly at friends without seeing them , shake hands without knowing whose hand he shook ; even in court he seemed centered in solitude . In former times when he had been depressed she had made a conscious effort to compensate for his grimness , keeping the house cheerful , putting a smile on her face , preparing special foods such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying a new vase or picture . But now she had no such expendable strength . When she could no longer stand the hours of bleak silence she would shout at him and then he would walk out of the house without a word and be gone the entire day . Once when she was thoroughly upset he commented in a dry voice : " Mary , there are times when you make this house intolerable . " " I make the house intolerable ! " she cried . " What do you think your charming insouciant manner contributes to the happiness of this house-hold ? " Their home became a grim place , weighed down by Abraham 's bleak silences and by her own harshness of manner . There were brief respites , moments of desperate loneliness when their need for each other was greaterp223than the distance and obstacles fate had put between them . But they passed quickly in the unrevealing dark , not to be recaptured when the sun rose and the problem-laden world took over again . She knew she was hurting herself in giving in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control herself . Also weighing on her was the galling knowledge that in the contest for Abraham , waged for years by William Herndon and herself , she had lost . Previously Abraham had spent as little time in his office as possible ; now he ran from his home to spend his time with the man he so affectionately called Billy . Was Abrahamfinding peace with his law partner ? Perhaps enjoying himself ? She was shattered by the experience ; all reserves of serenity were used up . She asked herself , How long can I last ? If I must be destroyed , why ca n't it be on the plane of high tragedy , where I might sacrifice my happiness for some great or noble cause ? But to be caught in the strained silence in the kitchen , the misunderstanding in the sitting room , the quarrel in the bedroom : what a terrible way to waste a life ! What an ignominious end . HER former admirer Edwin Webb was nominated by the Whigs for governor . Mary announced that she would help him because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . Henry Clay died and all the Todds along with Springfield went into mourning ; Abraham was nominated to preside over the Clay ceremoniesand to give the eulogy . His only comment while they were dressing was that although he admired Mr. Clay for the last heroic stand he had made for the Compromise of 185o , " I do feel that Clay 's personal ambitionsmay have wrecked the Whig party . " When on June 16 , 1852 , Stephen Douglas was beaten out for the Democratic presidential nomination by Franklin Pierce , an unknown New Hampshire politician , Abraham raised his eyebrows . . . in relief ? Later when he read Douglas 's first major speech of the campaign , deliveredin Richmond , she saw him go red in the face and then a dusty ash gray . She was not surprised therefore when she learned that he was going to answer Mr. Douglas before the Scott Club , named after General WinfieldScott , who had been nominated by the Whigs . He did not write his speech at home . She did not even know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sitting room and said , " Aren'tp224you dressed yet ? " she took it as a tacit invitation and got into a dark blue summer linen as quickly as she could . The courthouse was dimly lit by tallow candles . Mary slipped into one of the rear rows alongside her cousin Logan , using a fan to stir the hot air . Abraham rose to tell the Whig club that he was there at his own request because : " When I first read Douglas 's speech at Richmond I was reminded of old times , when Douglas was not so much greater man than all the rest of us as he now is . Believing that the Richmond speech though marked with the same species of ' shirks and quirks ' as the old ones was not marked with any greater ability , I was seized with a strong inclination to attempt an answer to it . . . . " It was the first time she had known Abraham to he querulous in a public talk , and it was obvious to her now as it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's speech that he was consumed with jealousy . Much of the speech she found dull and badly integrated ; when he went into a thin falsetto voice to elicit laughs the stories were unfunny and in poor taste . She sat there in humiliation ; not even in his earliest days when he was fumbling for means of expression had she seen him put on such a poor performance . The cauldronlike summer dragged on ; the gloom in the house was thick enough to bury in the back yard . She found herself flaring up at situations from . which she would have turned away a year before . She quarreled with the man driving Watson 's ice wagon because she was convinced he was giving her smaller blocks of ice than she was paying for . She quarreled with an old Portuguese gardener who brought her wild strawberries all summer for an agreed price of twenty-five cents , but toward the end deliveredsuch small and hard berries that she felt ten or fifteen cents was enough for the basket . She refused to give one of the Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , so the girl quit . A few moments later she found Katy and Abraham in conference on the back porch . " Now what were you two whispering about , if I may ask ? " " Oh , I persuaded Katy to stay on . " The following Saturday night after she had paid Katy her $1.25 she tiptoedinto the kitchen where she saw Abraham give the girl a coin and pat her on the shoulder . She went back into the sitting room and waited for . Abraham to reappear . " Just what did you give Katy ? " " A quarter . " " A quarter ? For what ? " " So she would n't leave you . It 's too hot for you to be doing the heavy work . "  | " You have no right to go behind my back with the servants . No wonder she 's been laughing at me . " " She has n't been laughing at you . It 's just that she 's happy because she is getting the wage she thinks she earns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I know what they are worth . You will kindly go to Katy 's place and tell her that I will no longer need her services . " She drudged from day to night through a thousand household tasks , but it was difficult to get Abraham to take care of his chores . The wood box was frequently empty , and she had to cry , " Fire ! Fire ! " in the hopes of routing him out of his lethargy . Once when she had supper to prepare and he was sitting in a chair tilted against a wall , ignoring her requests for firewood , she picked up the last stick from the scuttle and blazed away with it , hitting him on the nose . It cut the skin , which she fixed up with court plaster and apologies . The next day the story was all around town . She was convinced that it was Herndon who had spread it . However he could not have done so if Abraham had n't revealed what had happened on his domestic hearth . She knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham'sunhappiness . His friends were saying , " Poor Abraham Lincoln , married to Mary Todd . " How could she answer in rebuttal that Abraham was disenchanted with his life because his ambitions had come to nothing and the future looked meaningless , with little left in it beyond making a living and following a profession he only half enjoyed ? If they knew the full facts , if they had to live with him , might they not rather say , Poor Mary Todd , married to Abraham Lincoln " ? For there were others who saw Abraham walking the streets dripping melancholy , who understood what she must be undergoing ; she had friends and sympathizers as well as detractors . Then , just two days before his departure for the fall circuit , she found that she was again with child . She accepted the knowledge with apprehension . How would she fare , carrying under the great burden of their disjointedness ? Perhaps if she told Abraham it would help pull him out of his self-concentration ; knowing how much she had suffered while carrying William , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference . . . . But she did not want his pity . Nor would her pride allow her to use her condition to gain an advantage . She would utter no word ; when he returned he would see for himself , and that would be time enough . The next morning she awakened severely nauseous . She barely made the back porch . Here Abraham found her . He stood behind her , asked sympathetically : " Mary , what has happened to make you ill ? "  |p226She  did not reply . Her hands were trembling ; in the early morning sunlighther face was a mustard green . He stared at her for a long moment , then said : " Mary , are you . . . is this another child ? " She nodded her head . He crouched before her , touched her cheek with his fingers . After a moment he said : " I promised to go to Peoria from Pekin next week and the following week end I must take care of some work in Bloomington , but I can ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . . . . " She rose , poured some cold water into a basin , rinsed her face and patted the water through her hair . " I 'll be all right . What would you like for breakfast ? " He had not heard her question . " In any event I 'll be home in little more than a month . Stephen Douglas is going to speak for Franklin Pierce at the courthouse here and I 'm going to answer him . " She thought , Steve Douglas is apparently the only one who can arouse him any more . . . even bring him home from the circuit . She bit her lip and said nothing ; fried his eggs and sausages in the longhandledspider . There was little of the impromptu in her nature ; she enjoyed giving parties , but preferred them to be for a set time , with the food well prepared , the house ready to receive guests , the hostess dressed in a beautiful gown . Never having encouraged friends to drop in spontaneously , she was almost totally alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to cheer her as to make a common bond of their difficulties : for the only other man in Springfield who was as totally unhappy and seemingly a failure as Abraham Lincoln was Simeon Francis . With the splintering of the Whig party , its constant defeat in Illinois , Simeon finally had let the Journal slip until it had becomea much inferior paper to the Register , containing little but agriculturalnews . Simeon wanted to establish a nursery , raise plants , because , " though plants might be destroyed in frost or hurricane , they could not be blighted by annual elections " ; but he found no takers for his paper . As she and Eliza sat in the parlor desolately having a cup of coffee together , Mary wondered if what had happened to Abraham and to Simeon was the universal pattern of the man who reached middle age and found his aspirations unachievable ? Abraham was only forty-three , yet universally known as " Old " Abe . Her father , when he was stricken at fifty-eight , was a member of the Kentucky legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other businesses , young in his love of the good things of life . For that matter she considered herself a young woman at thirty-three.  |p227l  Ier faith in Abraham was indestructible : she had loved him on that faith , married him on that faith , endured the years of patient waiting on that faith . But for some reason indigenous to his own needs Abraham was driving himself ever downward through Dante 's Purgatory to the bottom of the abyss , where the last of his aspirations would be ground to dust on the hard rocks of the pit . And the more his future closed down , the more he turned away from her . This sense of rejection was painful ; everything he had done he had done by himself . Where then was her responsibility ? Being well read in the world 's romantic literature , she had thought that when a man had disappointments in the outside world he would turn to his love partner for solace , for renewed vitality . But when a man lost his passion for life , did his passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that marriage was a rock , the high ground where a couple could stand safe on the lee side of each other 's love while the storm lashed itself out . . . a sanctuary rather than a whipping post . Love could leaven failure , give life durable meaning when its youthful hope had fled or its ambition been crushed . One midafternoon her sister Ann , who recently had moved to Spring field with her husband , Clark Smith , came to the Lincoln house , her plump little figure hurrying up Eighth Street as though every second saved was of crucial importance . " Ann , you 're all palpitating , it must be mighty good news . " " I wish it were good news , Mary . . . but it 's always the wife who 's last to find out . " Mary 's knees began to quake . " Would you like a cup of coffee to sustain you while you impart the bad news ? " . . it 's that Lois Hillis woman , one of the Newhall family of singers ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts , alone , wo n't even sit with Cousin Stuart or his friends . . . " " He likes to be alone at entertainments . " " Well , maybe ; but that 's not the story Clark heard in his store this morning . Seems like everybody on the circuit noticed and warned your husband not to get involved . . . " " Now , Ann ! " " Seems last week they were staying in the same hotel and Abraham asked this Mrs. Hillis to sing some of his favorite songs , and she did , then she said he must give her some entertainment , and he stood in the parlor and recited all the verses of Oh , Why Should the Spirit of Mortal Be Proud ? When it was over this Lois Hillis went up to Abraham to tell him how beautiful it was , and could she have a copy . Abraham said , That 's the only woman that ever appreciated me enough to pay me a compliment . ' Then Judge Davis said , Why , Lincoln , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and all the men laughed uproariously . " Mary burned ; had n't she paid him the compliment of falling in love with him and marrying him ? Ann , seeing that she had struck fire , hitched her chair closer . " The next morning , this lawyer who told it to Clark , he got up before dawn , and when he went down to the dining room there was Abraham standing behind Mrs. Hillis 's chair while she was reading the poem he had written out for her ! Now what do you think of that ? " She had a glimmer of what Ann would have liked her to think , so she replied obliquely , " Abraham does n't sleep much on circuit ; I 'm sure he enjoyed writing out the poem . They say women are gossips ; if that lawyer had n't gossiped to Clark , and Clark had not gossiped to you , just how would you have been able to rush here with this luscious morsel ? " She fed her sister coffee and cake ; but once she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathing heavily . It was inconceivable . . . . She would not allow herself to be hurt , . . or torment herself with jealousy . Yet the next morning she was too miserable to drag her limbs out of bed . She sent Robert over to Frances 's to ask Dr. Wallace to stop by . When he came she poured out the tortured story of the past two wretched years . " Why do I have so little control , William ? Why am I stricken , when other wives must have suffered as much , perhaps more , and yet have managed to remain stable . . . " " Only seemingly , " replied William Wallace in a bland tone . " You do n't know the anatomy of their suffering quite as well as you do your own . Considering the weight and unacceptability of your burden , Mary , I would say that you are doing pretty well . " She raised herself on her elbows , staring at him in disbelief . " Do you really think so , William ? " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been despising myself for being so weak ! " " No , I think you are hardy . Things are difficult for you , and I know how sorely you are tried . " " Oh , William , if only I could be stolid ... " " Then you would n't be Mary Todd Lincoln , you would be several other women , none of whom you might enjoy . If I were you I would settle for being yourself . I 've been reading quite a little about genetics lately ; that 's the science of heredity . It might help you to understand yourself better if you would realize that you were n't given the best chance for a phlegmatic nature : your mother and father were second cousins ; and your grandmotherParker married her first cousin . " " I know the Bible forbids cousins to marry , but I always thought that had something to do with morals ? " " It has to do with blood lines : if two different blood lines are crossedp229they have a tendency to mix their strengths and weaknesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build up the identical strengths and weaknesses . If your parents and grandparents had been stolid people , you would probably be so unemotional you would feel nothing . But if they were a touch on the emotional side , you can see how that would intensify your sensitivity . " She nodded , understanding . " William , it seems like all bad times now . It 's been another twentymonthperiod like that one before we were married . " He pursed his underlip , his eyes gently reproving her . " You survived that first twenty months when Abraham took to the woods ; I do n't mean merely that you stayed alive , but that you kept your love and loyalty alive . Anyone who could have been as staunch under those circumstances is not going to be destroyed by a passing irresolution on the part of her husband . " " No , William , not if it is passing and not if it is irresolution . But what if it is permanent ? " " Nothing is permanent , every hour finds a shifting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or aggravation , Mary . Now get out of bed and go about your duties , until what Shakespearecalled the ' slings and arrows of outrageous fortune ' stop hailing down upon you . " She did what the doctor ordered . WHEN he returned at the end of October she needed only one look to know that the thought of the impending child had done nothing to recoup his spirits . He seemed , if possible , thinner and darker and bleaker than before . She saw no sign of animation in him until she brought up the name of Lois Hillis , with only a tiny hem of her seriousness showing . " I 've heard all about that romantic breakfast at dawn with the pretty young singer , Lothario Lincoln . " " That was n't a romantic breakfast , Mary , in fact it was n't a breakfast at all . I just copied out the poem I had recited the night before and brought it to her before her stage left . " " It 's hard enough for me . . . the malicious talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them flinging another young woman 's name . .  |p230He  broke into a wide grin , put an arm about her shoulders . " Mary , that 's the highest compliment you can pay a homely man , to be jealous of him . When I was in Bloomington I looked into the glass and I resolved should I ever see an uglier man I would shoot him on sight . The next morning I took one look at a new lawyer in town and said to him , Halt , sir ; I made a note that if ever I saw an uglier man than I am I would shoot him on the spot . Make ready to die . " Well , Mr. Lincoln , ' said the man , looking me squarely in the face , if I am any uglier than you , fire away . ' " He threw back his head and laughed . She smiled wanly . " No one would believe any gossip about me and a pretty young girl , Mary . They all know I 'm a bad bargain . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not jealous . I 'm just possessive ! You 're my husband . You belong to me . God knows I 've earned that much from all my misery . " " Yes , " his face became solemn again , " you have ; but it is a small com-pensation . " They had a tenth anniversary coming on November 4 , 1852 . She was determined not to let it go by default . She arranged for supper at the American House , going to the hotel to select the menu with the new chef . She then invited Elizabeth and Ninian , Frances and William , Eliza and Simeon Francis , Helen and Benjamin Edwards , Julia and Lyman Trumbull , her cousins Stuart and Logan , Dr. Todd and his two daughters , Elizabeth and Frances , and Ann Rodney Cushman , also a bridesmaid , the William Butlers , James Matheny , Abraham 's best man , still clerk of the circuit court , Mercy and James Conkling , now a successful real estate man . She discussed with the manager the hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did not confide her plans to Abraham until everything was settled , then told him of what she had done . She could see by the wordless way he looked at her that he had totally forgotten they were to have a tenth anniversary ; this fact kept him in the silence that had no choice but assent . She pushed her advantage by insisting that he buy a new suit and a pair of soft black leather boots for the affair . She resolved to make the dinner party a success : it would be her answer to the gossips of the town . She dressed in a new brocade with a round point lace collar , wrapping her hair extravagantly with a wreath of French flowers . The dining room at the American House was gaily lighted . Everyone except Abraham drank a lot of the iced champagne with the hors d'oeuvres ; there was laughter and gaiety at the long table . The only unpleasant moment was caused by Simeon Francis , who arrived with the news that Franklin Pierce had been elected president by a landslide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no one could any longer dispute that the Whigs were finished . Abraham took the news easily ; he had made only two or three desultory speeches for General Scott , anticipating the defeat . The choral singers rendered " Come Dwell with Me , " and a new song , " My Old Kentucky Home . " Nostalgically she wondered what her life would have been like had she married Desmond Fleming and remained in the Kentucky Bluegrass . The party did not break up until midnight . Everyone thanked her for the delightful affair , expressing the hope they would be invited to the Lincolns ' twentieth anniversary . Wistfully , she hoped so too . When they reached home and were standing in the hall , she turned to him . " Did you enjoy your tenth anniversary party ? " " Yes , I had a fine time . " All of her rigorous gaiety vanished . She walked into the dark parlor , sat on the edge of a fiddleback chair and held her face in her hands . Abraham lit a lamp , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , asked : " Abraham , what have I done ? " He stared at her for a moment , uncomprehending. " ... you mean the dinner ? But I was confoundedly well pleased . " " Even a criminal must be told the nature of his crime before being convicted . What is the nature of my crime , Abraham ? What law of love or marriage have I broken ? " Sadness settled over his face . " You have n't done anything , Mary . " " Then why do you no longer love me ? " He took the lamp off the mantelpiece and brought it close , peering at her intently . " Why do you ask that question ? " " Because I 've asked it of myself a thousand times in this past dreadful year when you stayed away or when you came home only to move through the rooms like a ghost . " " I never realized you felt this way . " " Tell me , Abraham , have I forced you into activities you did not want= Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Have I judged you unworthy for any task you were called to ? " " ... no , it is n't any of these things . . . it has nothing to do with you . " . . . but it must or you would not have put me out of your life . " She sat rigidly in the chair with her hands clasped between her breasts . " What has happened to the closeness of our relationship that you turn away fromp232me , stay out on circuit for months at a time . . . when you do n't have to ? " ... this is terribly painful to me . " " Painful ! " Her voice was a supplicating cry to the heavens . " What do you think I 've been suffering ? " He put a hand on her shoulder . " I did n't realize you were suffering , Mary . . . because I was so blinded by my own melancholy , I guess . " " I know I 've made mistakes , Abraham : I should never have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should n't have flares of temper with the servants , or speak harshly to tradesmen . I do n't keep house as easily as Mammy Sally ; I 'm sometimes penny-pinching , but it 's you who trained me to be economical so you could pay back your debts . I love fine materials and I spend more money on them than I should , but I 'm not buying expensive gowns from New York , I 'm only buying materials and spending my own time sewing the costumes ... " " Please , Mary . . . do n't shrive yourself before me . " She rose and walked to the whatnots on either side of the fireplace , running her hand over the oval frame boxes containing hair flowers . " Why do I humiliate myself this way ? I 've never been an ugly woman , I 'm not ill formed , I 'm not ignorant . I never lacked for friends . . . or suitors . I made up my mind what I wanted in life , and in you I found what I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that dreadful twenty months when you ran away from me ; nor why you should have wanted to put us through such misery . Perhaps it is only your children and sense of obligation that keep you from vanishing from my life now . . . " He hung his head , answered in a hoarse tone , " I deserve that . " " I 'm not interested in your just deserts . I only want to know why I am no longer attractive to you . You found me bright and intelligent ... " I 've always respected your judgment , " he interrupted . " Then have I become dull-witted ? Do I no longer understand the issues that face us ? " He turned away from her , gazed sightlessly into the mirror on the table between the street windows , started speaking in a low tone. " ... my feelings for you have not lessened in any way , Mary . Nor has any of my . . . gloom . . . been caused by you . Everything that has happened to me comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a meaningless life because there is nothing to look forward to . There are times when I can not endure the thought that I have nothing to give to anyone , not even my wife . But you ca n't know the hell I have suffered . You 've never hurt me ; certainly you 've never been too ambitious for me ; mine has always been the greater ambition . . . . " He was silent , winding his watch unknowingly with a brass key . " I have been wrapped up in my own dejection . It never occurred to me to ask what effect all this wouldp233have on my wife . I did n't know you were unhappy , Mary ; I know nothing about women . " " Are you telling me that you do n't know how deeply you have cut yourselfoff from your wife and children ? " He made fumbling gestures with his hands , his shoulders stooped , his big , long-faced head leaning forward toward her . His answer was oblique . " Out on circuit I am a practicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my fellow lawyers and the flurry of the courts and clients and young lawyers coming to me to write their briefs . I am an active and successful man , doing all that any man needs to do . . . " " And when you 're at home ? " " Here in Springfield . . . I realize that the practice of the law can never fill anything but a small part of my life . . . that the rest of it is empty . " He gripped her shoulders so hard she could feel the pain of her flesh under his grasp . " Try to understand me , Mary : it 's only when I come home that I realize I 've been a failure . That 's when I feel I would rather be any place in the world than here . " Her voice became lower , gentler . " I have never turned a face toward you accusing you of failure . " He stood so close that the rough material of his baggy knees brushed against the brocade of her dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remiss has come from inside me . We started out with such high hopes , you gave me your one and only life when you could have gone elsewhere to greater advantage : men better born , better educated , certainly with better prospects ... " " My feelings have not changed . . . " " It 's too late now . When I realize how completely I 've let you down , how I have become the least of all the men we know , it 's hard for me to come home . . . . It 's not that I no longer love you , Mary . " His voice too was a lonely cry in the night . " It 's that I no longer love myself ! The years have put a damp on my spirit . " There was silence in the cold dark parlor . Then she spoke . " Why have you lost your perspective , Abraham ? Everyone knows that politics is a sometime thing , that defeat in an election is no measure of a man 's worth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is n't this just another flight ? " Her voice was soft , for she did not mean to hurt him , yet the tone was insistent . " A steaming jungle of despair ? " He smiled wanly . " I do n't think so . It 's just an acknowledgment that I 've been barking up the wrong tree . " " You told Gibson Harris that you like a tree better in the winter ; that then you can see it in all its stark truth . The only reason you 're now saying that you 've been barking up the wrong tree is that the tree hasn'tp234borne fruit for us . But if you like it when it is in full fruit , then you have to like it in the winter . This is winter for us ; but that does n't mean the tree of politics is dead . " He grinned ruefully . " I always felt I could be needed and serve a purpose . But the kind of man needed today is a Stephen Douglas . " " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of you . " " If by his methods he can succeed and become dominant , then my methods can get me nowhere . " " Times change , needs change . May I quote one of your favorite passagesfrom Julius Caesar : There is a tide in the affairs of men , which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune . ' I 'm still a young woman . I feel that my life lies before me . Politics is in my blood . We must hold our heads high , read and study and think until the day comes when we can find our rightful place . " He took her in his arms , murmured , " You never lose hope for me , do you ? " and kissed her tenderly on the mouth . Someone came running up the steps , pounded sharply on the door . Abraham admitted a young man . " Mr. Lincoln , old lady Westly is dying . She sent me to ask you to come write her will . " Abraham turned to Mary . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour 's ride in the cold autumnal night , the fields lying in dark stubble . When they reached the farmhouse Abraham asked Mrs. Westly a few simple questions , and wrote the will . She asked in a feeble voice if he would read from the Bible . One of the woman 's sons offered him their copy , but he shook his head , reciting from the Twenty-third Psalm : " Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death , I will fear no evil , for Thou art with me ... " ' As they were riding home in the predawn darkness , sitting close under the blanket , Mary said , " Pastor Lincoln , you did real well for a man who is not supposed to have a religion . " Abraham looked up . The heavens were full of stars . He called off a few of their names . " I can see how it might be possible for a man to look down upon the earth and be an atheist , but I can not conceive how he could look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They rode in silence for another moment , then she felt his hand reach out and take hers.  |p235IT  was what the old settlers called " a good tight winter , " with plenty of snow , rain and cold . When Abraham had to leave for three more weeks of circuit , then to take evidence in the Illinois and Michigan Canal dispute for the legislature , he assured her he would be home at every opportunity . One morning when she felt distress she summoned Dr. Wallace . He said : " Mary , not letting a doctor take care of pregnant women because of the question of delicacy is profound nonsense . There is a man in town , a German doctor by the name of Wohlgemuth who is a surgeon and accoucheur . I 'd like to have him take care of you during these months , and deliver your baby . . . instead of calling in a midwife at the last minute . Do you think Abraham would approve ? " " He might .... " When Abraham returned in mid-December he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard as long as Michelangelo'sMoses but who knew precisely what she was undergoing , and wrote a prescription which did away with most of her pain . Abraham had had a successful trip ; he loaned one of the local blacksmiths five hundred dollars on an interest note , and when Ninian Edwards overextended himself , was able to help him out of his difficulties with a substantial amount of cash . he had bought two lots in Bloomington as a gift for her , and also brought the story of the proprietors of an area in Logan County who had asked permission to name their new town Lincoln , in his honor . " I told them they 'd better not do that for I never knew anything named Lincoln that amounted to anything , " he said with a laugh , but she could see that he was pleased . If there was no great fire within Abraham , neither was there the intense melancholy of the past twenty months . The driving force of the early years , that he must somehow leave the world a better place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent ; if there was a vestige of despair in the quiet corners of his heart , he now shielded it from her and from the world . He was attentive and friendly , spent more time with the boys , playing marbles with them on the front street , going with Robert to Estabrook'sAcademy to hear the boy recite . Though he refused to join the large crowd going to the Hall to see Governor Matteson sworn in , or to attend the open reception at the governor 's home , he volunteered to go to her Bell Society banquet in the Senate chamber to help her group raisep236money for a new church bell . He also took her to Stephen Douglas 's levee at the Capitol in honor of Douglas 's re-election to the United States Senate for another six-year term ; as part of his recovery he had put aside his feelings about Senator Douglas , pushing through the jam of fifteen hundred celebrants to congratulate him . When on the morning of February 12 , 1853 , the Illinois Senate , as a birthday present to Abraham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the county seat of Logan County , Mary quickly set to work constructing a papier-mache model of a state capitol which she placed in the middle of the dining-room table , then sent out messages to their family and friends to come to a buffet supper . There was no need for her to play a role at this party , to fix a smile on her face ; she was content . At the height of the fun about the supper table Abraham leaned over and said , " This time I think I 'll accept your offer . . . . Now that my father is gone , I 'd like to name a child after him . " " Frankly , I 'm boning up on names like Emilie and Eliza . " " Reconcile yourself , Mary , the science books I 've been reading say that like ingredients always bring forth like results . " Her fourth child was delivered by Dr. Wohlgemuth in the early morninghours of a bright April day . She heard the doctor say , " A boy , " then noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound . She slept straight through the next twenty hours , awakening in time for the first feeding . To her eyes the baby seemed the fairest of the four , with a good stand of blond hair and small features . Abraham stood over her , chuckling : " He looks like a tadpole , with a big head on such a small body . I 'll bet it 's crammed with brains . I think we 'll make a poet and philosopher out of him , like Mr. Emerson . " He ran his fingers through the child 's fine hair , saying , " You 're going to have too much sense to be an ambulating country lawyer , are n't you , Tadpole ? " She smiled ; it was good to hear him make a joke on himself . She lay back among the pillows gazing down into the baby 's eyes while he nursed . After a time she noticed a tiny but steady stream flowing through his nostrils . She pushed herself up among the cushions , shifted the baby 's position , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued . She told Dr. Wohlgemuth about it . He hesitated , then said : ... yes , I know . . , there 's a little deviation , nothing too serious ... The hollow-sounding birth cry came to her mind . " What . . . what . . do you mean by . . . deviation ? " " Well , a small aperture in the roof of the boy 's mouth . Most of his milk he swallows , but at the moment he breathes , it goes up through the openinginto the nasal passages . "  |p237Too  stunned to think , she struggled forward on her elbows , her eyes devouring the doctor 's face . Then she started to open the boy 's lips . The doctor stopped her with a dismissing dip of the hand . " There 's nothing to see , and nothing to worry about , Mrs. Lincoln . Once he is eating solid food there will be little interference . " " Why did it happen ? " she cried in anguish . " We 're both healthy , normal people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He is , Mrs. Lincoln . Divergences happen . It can not in any way affect his health . " " But when he cries . . . he does n't sound like other children ... " " Yes , he may have a little trouble with his speech because of the cleft palate . He 'll have to be trained ; but not until he 's in school . " " Does my husband . . . know about this ? " " I told him immediately . He asked me not to say anything to you until you had gotten back your strength . " When Abraham came in she wept in his arms . " Abraham , what have we done that God should make our children suffer ? " " Now , now , that little Tadpole is n't going to suffer from anything . I 'll wager you my law license against your last year 's bonnet that he is the smartest member of the Lincoln family . I fell crazy in love with him the moment I laid eyes on him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palate : he could n't talk at all , just a lot of strange sounds . His mother and father said they understoodhim , but the children taunted him , called him an idiot . .. . Oh , Abraham , they 'll make our boy even more miserable than they did Bobby ! " She buried her head against his bony chest . He stroked her hair . " You should be thanking God that you and the boy are well . Mrs. Dallman around the corner gave birth same time you did , but she 's dangerouslyill , and not able to nurse their son . They have been searching all over town for a wet nurse . " Mary pulled back slowly , gazed at him , then exclaimed in a voice from which all self-pity was gone : " Abraham , go get the child and bring him here . " Abraham jumped up from the bed and stalked out of the room . He was back in a few moments with a tiny mite wrapped in a blanket . He stooped over , laid little Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bone , tugged hungrily , then closed his eyes and fell asleep . Abraham wrapped him in his blanket and walked him back to the Dallman house . Every four hours he brought the infant to her . She watched him grow strong and lusty , even as her own child was strong and lusty . By the end of the week when Abraham had to leave on circuit , Mrs. Dallman hadp238recovered sufficiently to feed her son . Mr. Daliman came to visit with a huge box of candy , and tears of gratitude in his eyes . " Without you I would have lost my son , Mrs. Lincoln . How can I thank you ? " " God is good , " Mary replied . She had not meant to say it ; she had not even known she said it ; yet somehow the tragic imperfection of their own child had been alleviated by her ability to help Charles . This was what Mr. Emerson had meant by the law of compensation . Somehow the troubles of the past two years seemed well behind her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illnesses she had suffered with William . Abraham was convinced that this was due to Dr. Wohlgemuth'sexcellent care . She went through the house with fresh eyes ; saw that during the bad time the place had run down , the fence needed repairing , the front yard was full of brambles and locust shoots . Abraham was back at the end of three weeks , having ridden an extra eighty miles to spend the days between the Pekin and Clinton courts . He was wild about the new child , constantly picking him up and walking the length of the house with him . They never mentioned Thomas 's cleft palate ; Mary had found by experimentation the best position in which to feed him ; Abraham settled down to the names of Tad or Taddie . When he returned again early in June he advised her that her brothers Levi and George had filed a claim against them in the Lexington court for $472.54 , alleging that he had collected this money from people who owed it to the firm of Oldham and Todd , and never paid it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone to question Abraham 's integrity . During the past two dreary years the only heartening stories to reach her were that Abraham was maintaining a fortress within himself , that his basic integrity was being preserved intact , a redoubt which no man and no external circumstance could pierce . People called him a fair lawyer ; judges said publicly that he seemed innocent of the art of deception or dissimulation ; lawyers said that he refused to misstate the law even to his own advantage ; clients felt they could follow him without going wrong , that he would abandon a case rather than bolster up a false position ; juries said they would take his exposition of the law and the facts of the case without scruple , for they knew he never had misconstrued the law or perverted the evidence . The fact that the suit had been filed by one of Lexington 's leading attorneysand was a matter of public knowledge in Kentucky had Abraham thoroughly indignant . The only money he ever had collected for her father had been a fifty-dollar debt which they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers will name any living accessible man as one from whom I received their money I will go to that man and disprove the charge . " She helplessly swallowed her fury at her brothers . What could she say ? Summer temperatures were so high that when the courts opened in July the judges and lawyers agreed to put the cases off until cooler weather . Abraham told his boys that the weather made him feel like taking off his flesh and sitting in his bones , which literal-minded Robert said was silly , but sent fun-loving William into gales of laughter . By mid-July the temperaturewas up to ninety-four degrees , sultry and oppressive , with only an occasional evening shower to cool the air . Yet for Mary it was a pleasant summer , and in spite of the sustained heat Springfield was bustling ; Illinois wheat was bringing a high price in the new markets opened by the railroad lines ; the merchants and farmers were prospering , as were the lawyers : including Abraham . " I 've just been offered the largest law question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confided to her . " Champaign and McLean counties are assessing for taxation the lands owned by the Illinois Central and they want me to represent them . However , the railroad is also asking me to take their case , and they are willing to pay a $250 retainer fee . I 'm somewhat trammeled by what has passed between me and the clerk of Champaign County , he has the prior right to my service , but I have to tell him to make sure he can get me a fee somewhat near what I can get from the railroad . I ca n't afford to miss such a big fee . " Fall came , and Abraham started on the long trek . She was sorry when the Powels moved to a neighboring town and she could no longer have their son Howard to stay at night , but she found a new Irish girl who was willing to sleep in . Her major preoccupation was with young Tad . When he reached six months she started him on solid foods and learned to distract him with songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came time for him to feed himself she would find ways of teaching him the same technics . William was completely devoted to the baby , watched over him in the yard while he slept , played with him on the floor of the kitchen . As for Robert , she explained to him as best she could the handicap with which Tad had been born , thinking he would sympathize with the youngster since he himself had suffered a hardship . Instead Robert took it as a personal affront that there was something wrong with his brother , acting as though his parents had injured his position among the other boys . When he walked past Tad he did so with eyes averted . Like Abraham , she loved the boy madly ; his affliction sat like a stone on her heart.  |p240THEY  had a beautiful fall , the weather warm and mellow . She took the children to hear the Swiss Bell Ringers , to see P. T. Barnum 's circus with Tom Thumb . In the evenings she left them with the Irish girl while she , Mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dramatists and Danseuses , and to a series of lectures by Professor Palmer on Phrenology . Abraham sent her messages : the clerks of the counties had released him ; he had been paid his retainer fee by the Illinois Central ; his lawyer in Lexington had obliged Levi and George to name the individuals involved in their suit , and he was taking depositions from them at Shelbyville and Beardstown . Three or four afternoons a week she went to Dr. Jayne 's , where Julia had moved her husband so that her father could supervise his recovery from a lung ailment , and tried to cheer her old friends whose fortunes were being blighted by this lingering illness . In mid-November she had a letter from Betsy saying that Emilie would like to come to Springfield for a visit . Mary invited her to stay with the Lincolns , and spent the next two weeks sewing fresh white sheer curtains for the sewing room . Abraham returned in time to receive Emilie of the long reddish-blond hair , deep blue eyes , soft peach skin and fine features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Abraham held out his long arms to her , saying , as he had in Lexington , " so this is Little Sister . " " I do n't have my mother 's billowing skirts to hide behind this time , " Emilie replied ; " besides you do n't seem so tall now , Brother Lincoln . " Mary helped her sister unpack . " The first night I was in Elizabeth 's house we put a candle in the parlor window , so that all the young men in town would know we were at home . But Springfield is a big city now , seven thousand people , and it would n't do us a bit of good . I 've arranged for a buffet supper and dance at the American House . " " That 's thoughtful of you , Mary , " said Emilie . " But I would n't want it said that I came here looking for a husband . " " Very well , I promise not to put a card in the Journal advertising for one . But I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy whirl . Mary gave parties for Emilie , took her to formal balls at the Odd Fellows ' Hall or in the new saloon of the Ives and Curran Jewelry Building . For their New Year 's Eve party she hadp241all the furniture moved out of the parlor and sitting room , spread rice dust on the floor , engaged a four-piece orchestra . The two women received hand in hand . The New Year was only three or four days old when all hell broke loose . It was their friend Stephen Douglas who was responsible for the outburst : as chairman of the Committee on Territories , Senator Douglas had brought to the Senate the report on the vast Indian-occupied Nebraska country , announcing that it : " . shall be received into the Union with or without slavery . " They were sitting in their rockers before a blazing log fire . Puzzled , Mary asked : " All of the Nebraska country lies north of the Missouri Compromise line , does n't it ? Would n't that fact automatically exclude slavery ? " He gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he spoke it was in a slow , absorbed manner . " There never was any thought . . . in anyone 's mind . . . that slaves would be allowed into Nebraska . The freedom character of that country is as unalterably fixed by the Missouri Compromise as our own home here in Illinois . " He picked up the Register which contained the report . " When Douglas talks about moving property into the territories he 's talking about slaves . Under his reasoning the Missouri Compromise could be declared illegal , and there would be no territory anywhere in America which would not be open for slavery . He 's the one who fought so hard for the Compromise of 185o , but this bill will open the whole conflict again ! What is he hoping to gain by it ? " " The White House . " It was as though her three words had struck him across the face like the thongs of a rawhide whip . " But the slavery road is not the road to the Executive Mansion : it splits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began pacing the floor , brows knitted , body tense . She had not seen him so agitated since he had been deep in politics himself . Her eyes followed him , her own body became tense , her lips pressed tight . The debate in Congress over this Nebraska bill would be a long and heated one . would Abraham remain aroused ? He had sworn that he was no longer interested in politics ; but certainly the picture of him now as he paced up and down the floor of the sitting room was anything but the portrait of a disinterested man . During the next three weeks they read all the newspapers they could lay their hands on , the Boston Post , the Philadelphia Argus and the New York Tribune from the north , the New Orleans Bulletin , Charleston News and Macon Messenger from the south . As Abraham pored over the re/ports he kept asking himself how far Douglas would dare to go in his tampering with the Missouri Compromise . Their answer came on January 23 , 1854 , when Stephen Douglas brought onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he divided the Nebraska lands into two territories , Kansas and Nebraska , stipulated that when the territories were admitted as states they would be received with or without slavery as their own constitutions prescribed ; and that the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was now null and void . Mary no longer had to ask herself whether Abraham would remain aroused ; she never had seen him more profoundly disturbed . Was this a strategic move on Douglas 's part to consolidate his party ? Was he trying to get Nebraska admitted quickly because he wanted the steam railroad across the continent to take a northern route , with Chicago as the eastern terminus ? Try as they might they could find no satisfactory reason for the shocking act ; nor was Abraham 's overpowering wrath any longer a matter of personal jealousy : the issues here were greater than one man 's ambition or resentments . If Douglas 's bill became law the whole of the unsettled American continent would be open to slavery . Abraham stood before the fire reaching out his cold hands to the flames . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's the truth : he controls large majorities in both Houses . Singlehanded he is going to plunge this nation right back into its bitter sectionalism and clamor for disunion . . . from both sides . I can only think of the line in Julius Caesar : He cloth bestride the narrow world like a Colossus ; and we petty men walk under his huge legs , and peep about to find ourselves dishonourablegraves . ' " Mary fell asleep the instant her head touched the pillow . When she awakened at dawn she saw Abraham sitting on the side of the bed in his long yellow nightshirt , his chin on his chest . He heard her sit up , turned , and with a piercing expression asked : " Mary , can this nation continue to exist half slave and half free ? " IT was as though the years of lassitude had never existed : before , Abraham had been interested in politics as a means of rising in the world , though his ambition had been leavened by a fascination with self-government . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spread , his self-interest dissolved in a dedication to principle . Evenings found him knee-deep in newspapers and magazines , stretched out on thep243I k or of the sitting room . No longer did he go to the state-house library for I un and companionship ; he went instead to study the actual intent of the Constitution on the subject of slavery , the first Ordinance written for the Northwest Territory in 1787 , the economics of slavery , the debates which arose out of the Missouri Compromise of r82o and the Compromise of t85o . When he left the house he told her what he was going to search for ; when he returned he told her what he had found . More than ever as he ceased to confide in his men friends she became his confidante and assistant . Their love blossomed , deep and strong in understanding . Their lives had been compounded of a common faith in accomplishment ; without it their relationship had lacked spiritual succor . Now that she was again a full participant he shared with her the slow painful process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Mary , I should not know what to do as to the existing institution of slavery . But to extend it , that I know to be a crime against God and man . " She was no longer the mirror of his failure , but the reflection of his vitality and his dedication . He was able to face his wife and to respect her because he respected himself . The wretched months had taken their toll ; she could not pretend that she looked young for her thirty-five years ; her figure had grown solid , her face was beginning to assume a rigid aspect , her lips taut , her eyes harder . . . Yet Abraham was ardent . As he came back to life his skin took on color , his eyes sparkled , the whole animated cast of his face became attractive . The moment he entered the house his vibrancy could be felt . No one could set Abraham Lincoln down as absent ; once again he was present , ready to stand up and be counted . She went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat in the semicircular balcony under the dome to listen to the debate on the Nebraska bill . Of the seventy Democratic members of the House only three were in favor of Douglas 's bill , yet word had been received from Senator Douglas that he wanted his bill backed by the Illinois legislature , and it was approved by a large majority exactly as he had written it . When she took this report home to Abraham , he exclaimed : " What amazing power that steam engine in britches has acquired , that without even being present he can make a body of men go against their principles ! " By March 4 , 1854 , in spite of the fact that Douglas was opposed by Horace Greeley in the New York Tribune , Henry Raymond in the New York Times , William Cullen Bryant in the Evening Post and a hundred other northern newspapers ; in spite of the mass protest meetings held in nearly every city outside of the south , the thousands of resolutions adopted and sent to the administration and Senate ; in spite of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas whipped his Nebraskabill through the Senate . In the ensuing weeks , with the hurricane mounting in furor , with three thousand New England clergymen protestingagainst the bill , with the lawyers , physicians , architects , engineers , authors giving full time to the defeat of Douglas and his bill , with exhortatorypamphlets flooding the country , with the merchants of Boston , New York , Chicago and Philadelphia circulating petitions and raising money to oppose it , Senator Stephen Douglas pushed his bill through the House and made it the law of the land . " Law is an improper word , " cried Abraham agitatedly when the news was telegraphed to Springfield . " That enactment is a violence : it was conceived in violence , it was passed in violence , it will have to be maintainedand executed in violence . There will be violence in Kansas and Nebraska , and if they try to bring those states in as slave states the violence will spread to the rest of the nation . We 've been totally defeated , literally millions of us , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Napoleon every day . He has got to be stopped ! " Mary had been stitching in the sleeves of a cotton shirt for three-yearoldWilliam . She dropped her work and sat gazing at him , wide-eyed . " How ? " " I do n't know how . But I know the beginning step : Richard Yates from our district is a strong anti-Nebraska man . I 've got to persuade him to stand for re-election to Congress , then stump for him with all my might . " A soughing movement swept through her . She tried to keep her voice calm . " What about yourself ? Should n't you be in Washington to prevent Kansas and Nebraska from coming into the Union as slave states ? " When she saw him looking at her out of the corner of his eye she added hurriedly , " No , Abraham , I 'm not speaking from personal ambition : if you can change , I can change ; if you can grow , I can grow . " " I do n't want to run for office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be free to stand with the right wherever I find it . " " Could Steve do any part of the damage if he were n't in the United States Senate ? Could n't you do a thousand times more good by being in the Senate to oppose him ? " " Douglas has a genius for getting himself elected . I have yet to discover that genius in myself . " They became involved in an election on a more local level : William Herndon was running for mayor of Springfield , and Abraham was out campaigning for him . Mary was convinced that Herndon would make the worst mayor Springfield ever had had , but to her amazement he not only got himself elected , but cleaned up the town , graded streets , put in sidewalks , got rid of the mud , gave out contracts for the installation of gasp245lamps for street corners , passed ordinances that no more refuse could be dumped in the public streets , ordered all offensive privies removed from the city limits and , to cap the climax , pushed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city limits . " I 'll make a grudging admission , Abraham , your partner must have some ability after all . And I 'm so grateful he has banned liquor : you wo n't he awakened at dawn to bail him out of jail . " " Now , Puss , it 's been four years since Billy broke up that grocery ! " During the bad years he had abandoned her nickname , Molly , and she had missed it ; now he called her Puss whenever he was feeling affectionate . She did not know where he had picked it up , but she liked the intimacy of it . The summer brought Cassius Clay to speak at the state house . Since his disastrous campaign for the governorship of Kentucky he had been retired to his farm . Stephen Douglas 's Nebraska bill had brought him galvanicallyout of retirement . When Abraham came home for his midday meal he brought news that the Democratic Secretary of State had refused permission to Cassius to speak in the rotunda of the state house , the first public lecturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham to an open grove where a thousand people had gathered and a wooden stand been improvised . They stretched out on the cool grass , gazing up at the sartorially perfect Cassius , his big head of hair , enormous burning eyes , massive features ; a pillar of strength . Abraham picked up some branches lying about on the ground , took out his pocket knife and began whittling away at them . Cassius , amid shouts of " Take him down ! " began a two-and-a-halfhourattack on the repeal of the Missouri Compromise . His powerful voice filled the grove , not only with the volume of sound but with the grandeur of his moral indignation . " So long as slavery continues a local institution , " Clay cried with his arms wide-extended , " it should be left to itself . But when slavery becomes aggressive and proposes to extend itself over free territories , I shall rise and stigmatize it as it deserves . " " Would you help a runaway slave ? " shouted a heckler standing behind Mary and Abraham . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retorted Cassius . At the end of the speech Cassius received an ovation . Abraham said admiringly , " He is still a Jeremiah ! " Mary led him up to the platform . When Cassius 's eyes lighted upon her he jumped to the ground and embracedher . " Cash , you tell me this instant where you are staying , so Abraham can go get your bag . " They had supper out on the porch , with pitchers of lemonade to quenchp246their thirst . Mary sat in a corner listening and watching the two men with the moon on their faces , while Abraham asked where they would find an organization of free men who would bury their past political animosities and strike at slavery wherever it could be reached under the constitution ; and Cassius asked him what he thought of the new Republicanparty which had had its first meeting in Ripon , Wisconsin , in February , and another in Jackson , Michigan , a few weeks later . " I have no objections to fusing with anybody , " Abraham replied firmly , " providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but this group is composed of so many radical abolitionists that I do n't see how I can stand with them without encouraging a split with the south . " Early the next day Lyman and Julia Trumbull called , hoping to meet Clay , who had left for his next speaking engagement . Lyman had been too ill to go out to the grove , but after reading the speech in the Journal he had come to inform Clay and the Lincolns that he was bolting the Democratic party and was going to work to get the Kansas-Nebraska bill repealed . For a man as thin and ravaged by illness as Lyman , this was a heroic decision . Mary told him so . She also invited them to stay for supper . Julia pressed her husband to accept . Julia Jayne had been Mary 's greatest admirer , saying , " You 're the prettiest talker I ever met . " The girls had come really close during the secret meetings with Abraham , and doubly regretted the fact that the Trumbulls had moved first to Bellevilleand then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during court sessions in Springfield . Julia , who always dressed in black now , had been a witty girl , but she had lost a son in infancy , and the years of living with staid , laughterless Lyman had drained much of the gaiety out of her . To some people Lyman seemed a little cold ; he was a good student , an intellectual really , who wore gold spectacles and rarely smiled . However he had a rapport with the Lincolns , and now that he was convalescing , the two families spent many of the warm summer evenings together . Toward the end of the summer Lyman announced that he was going to run for Congress in the fall . He urged Abraham to return to active politics . " I 'm already back in , " replied Abraham ; " Yates has said he will run for re-election to the Congress if I run for the state legislature and help bolster the ticket . " Mary exclaimed , " But , Abraham , you said it was too late for you to go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different circumstances . I promised to get out and help get Yates re-elected , and if he thinks my name on the ticket will be a help , Icertainly am going to run . " After Julia and Lyman had gotten into their carriage and driven away ,  |p247Mary  asked , " Have the Whigs a chance of winning a majority in the state legislature ? " " We might get an anti-Nebraska-bill coalition . " A flame of hope shot through her . " Does n't the new state legislature elect the next United States senator ? " " Now , Puss , I 've barely got one toe in the water ... " " And here I am pushing you into the middle of the ocean ! But Jimmy Shields ca n't get it again . And if at long last we have a set of circumstanceswhich will put the voting power in the hands of the Whigs . . He smiled , shook his head up and down with pursed lips . " That random thought has flicked across the open spaces of my mind too . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Senate , I shall certainly consider the chance of being that man . " She drew up to her full height , her head high and cocked to one side . " So we petty men are no longer going to walk under the legs of the Colossus and peep about to find ourselves dishonourable graves . We 're on the track again ! " ABRAHAM had to go to Bloomington for some legal work , but Stephen Douglas would be there , and he hoped to lock horns with him . He returned with sparkling eyes and a jaunty step . " Douglas refused to debate me ! He said , This is my meeting ; the people came here to hear me , and I want to talk to them . ' But when he finished the crowd called for me to speak . I told them to go home and get their supper , then to come back and I would speak , and I would give Douglas a chance to answer me . I felt confident the Democrats would return for the fun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him instead ? " He made a head-down , left-shoulder-up gesture of bewilderment . " That banty rooster is a hard critter to keep skinned . You 'll see for yourself : he 's speaking here at the Fair Grounds on opening day . " On Tuesday morning , October 3 , 1854 , she had the family up , dressed and breakfasted by eight . " We 'd better see the exhibits early , remember last year the rainstorm turned the Fair Grounds into a sea of mud . Do n't Bobby and Willie look nice in their new broadcloth suits ? " Abraham hitched up the carriage and the five Lincolns drove west of pringfield to the Fair Grounds . There were already hundreds of peoplep248abroad , looking at the exhibits of prize cattle , horses , sheep , poultry . At one end of the grounds were the wooden stands that had been erected for five thousand people to hear Stephen Douglas that afternoon . Abraham and Robert were fascinated by the displays of newly invented mowers , reapers and threshing machines ; Mary took William to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Elizabeth 's daughter Julia had submitted in the prize contest . By ten o'clock the children were hungry . Abraham bought them hot roasted corn , cakes and sweet drinks . A sprinkling of rain started ; they ran for their carriage , reaching it just as the downpour began . " That 'll be the end of Douglas 's out-of-doors speech , " said Abraham mournfully ; " I hate to lose those ten thousand ears .... " That afternoon they jammed their way into the state house , finding seats at the rear of the long semicircular hall . When Douglas mounted the dais Mary craned forward to get a close look at the man who had becomein these four years of Abraham 's eclipse the undisputed master of the Democratic party and of the federal government . He had grown heavier than when she had seen him last ; she took in the elegantly tailored cutawaycoat , silk vest and trousers ; the mop of wavy brown hair brushed heavily backwards and grown a little gray over the ears , the wide-set burning eyes , big bony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the outpouring power of the man as he stood there , short arms outstretched as though to embrace the crowd of two thousand souls , captivating his audience before uttering a single word . When he started speaking his deep , booming voice served not only as a spear but as a net ; the inner fire that flamed forth scorched the listener 's mind , burnt away hostility or doubt ; the closely integrated arguments led the listener onward from one point to another with almost lethal certainty . She did not know when Abraham left her side , but after a time she saw him out in the lobby pacing back and forth . He could hear Stephen out there ; that voice coming from the platform could be heard all over Illinois . At five o'clock , when Douglas finished , he was given an ovation . All around her she heard people cry , " Magnificent ! Unanswerable ! " She made her way to the lobby . In a moment the crowd started streamingout . Abraham mounted the stairway leading to the balcony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow , same time , I will reply to Senator Douglas . Tomorrow afternoon at two o'clock , come to hear the answer to Senator Douglas . " When Douglas appeared in the lobby , flushed with triumph and surrounded by admirers , Abraham called out , " Mr. Douglas , I invite you to be here tomorrow to hear my answer and to correct me in any matters of fact . " " Accepted ! " Douglas cried.  |p249They  went directly to the journal office where Abraham drew up a handbill announcing his reply to Douglas . Simeon said he would print the handbill after supper and cover the town and Fair Grounds with it the next morning . Then they went home , had a supper of cold tongue and salad and hot raised rolls . Mary put William and Tad to bed and rejoined Abraham in the sitting room where he had dumped dozens of torn and irregular scraps of paper onto the desk from his hat , as well as a quire of rough and interlined pages of the speech he had been trying experimentally in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me weave all these notes , Puss . I 've been scribbling them for weeks . ' What would you say was the nib of Douglas 's reason why it was good to pass the Nebraska Act and declare the Missouri Compromise null and void ? " " Nib ? Well , let 's see : that the Compromise of 185o repealed the MissouriCompromise because it provided for the admission of Utah and New Mexico without prohibiting slavery ; that slavery is an economic issue and not a moral one ; that it is n't feasible in the vast new lands being opened to the American public , and hence wo n't exist there ; that slavery never has been a matter on which Congress could legislate or impose its will upon a free people ; that the question of slavery must be left to popular sovereignty in each new territory and state . " " Good nibbing : now let 's see if I can do as well with my own thinking : the Missouri Compromise kept this country at peace for over thirty years ; slavery is morally wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us up to the scorn and ridicule of the rest of the world ; while it may not be disturbed where it exists because there is no legal way so to do , not one further rod of American earth must ever be exposed to the dread institution ; both the Constitution and the Congress have had the legal right throughout our entire history to limit the extension of slavery . " They worked until two in the morning , Mary bringing in coffee and chocolate cake around midnight . They slept for five hours , then had breakfast and went back to work , correcting and revising until noon , at which time they had a clean copy . The day was sultry . They walked to the square . As they reached the state house Senator Douglas arrived in an open carriage flanked by GovernorMatteson and Senator James Shields . Everyone nodded formally . A seat had been saved for Mary in the front row but she preferred to sit in the rear so that she could watch the crowd . The Hall seemed even more jammed than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans were meeting in Springfield in order to form a state central committee , and had come in a body to hear Abraham speak . When the applause had quieted , she heard Abraham say , " Mr. Cheer/man : Yesterday I gave Senator Douglas the privilege of correcting me in any facts which I shall state , but not the inferences which I shall draw from them , as they are the nib of the whole question . " Every few moments Douglas jumped to his feet to make a correction . After a time the crowd began calling out , " You 're taking advantage ! Sit down , Senator Douglas ! " Abraham grew angry , thrust his long arm and index finger down at Stephen Douglas , sitting under hirn , and cried : " Senator Douglas , I withdraw the privilege of correcting me . Friends , the facts which I shall hereafter state I shall state on my own responsi-bility . " The crowd applauded . Abraham plunged into his speech , his manner impassioned , his voice quivering with emotion . The Hall had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She watched him stop to discard his stock , then his coat , then his vest , standing in his shirt sleeves and galluses . . . with the Hall alternately still as death or ringing with applause . " The repeal of the Missouri Compromise is wrong : wrong in its direct effect , letting slavery into Kansas and Nebraska , and wrong in its prospectiveprinciple , allowing it to spread to every other part of the wide world , where men can be found inclined to take it . " This declared indifference , but as I must think , covert zeal for the spread of slavery , I can not but hate . I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself . I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world , enables the enemies of free institutions , with plausibility , to taunt us as hypocrites , forces so many really good men amongst ourselves into an open war with the very funda mental principles of civil liberty : criticizing the Declaration of Independenceand insisting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For Mary . her husband 's speech was so loaded with incontrovertible fact and at the same time so filled with moral grandeur that it turned Stephen Douglas 's structure of popular sovereignty into a heap of ruins . Early the next morning Abraham hitched up old Buck to the buggy and left for court at Pekin . He explained that he might have remained at home another day but that the Fusionists planned to call on him to speak at the Hall of Representatives that night and to join their party . " They 're dominated by abolitionists , and I ca n't go along with their thinking . Besides , if I become known as a Republican I 'll lose the support of the old-line Whigs and the bolting Democrats . " The next afternoon her cousin Stephen Logan came to inform her that the ruse had not worked : the Fusionists , fired by Abraham 's speech , had named him to their Republican Central Committee . Cousin Logan 's red hair had faded white , but his eyes were brilliantly alive : a little man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham , her cousin explained , could considerably lessen Abraham 's chances of being named to the United States Senate . Her ears stopped : this was the first time she had heard anyone put their own hopes into words ; if Cousin Logan felt that way , must not there be others ? She brought her attention back to Logan 's high shrill voice. ... frankly disappointed , these past few years . I had such high hopes for him . He 's been a good lawyer , but the promise of bigness I saw . . . " " And now , Cousin Logan ? " He stood shaking his head up and down at her . " Abraham 's speech yesterday was the finest I 've ever heard . Half a dozen times through it I was choking with emotion . I saw the power and the courage in him that I once thought possible , and then watched crumble away . He is our strongest voice now . I 'm going to nominate him myself for the United States Senate . " The weeks that followed were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech was printed in the newspapers and widely distributed over the state , becoming the rallying point of Whig , Republican and anti-Nebraska Democrat . Then she learned that he was on his way to Chicago . He arrived home the day before election ; though he had n't been able to concentrate on the law , his campaigning had gone robustly , particularly the address in the Market Hall to an overflowing crowd . He brought her a copy of the Chicago Journal , where she read : His speech was as thorough an exposition of the Nebraska iniquity as has ever been made and his eloquence greatly impressed all his hearers . Born of parents who could only give him faith in rectitude and virtue , he has become what he is through the trials of poverty and by the sweat of his brow . " Never thought my humble origin ' would do me any good , " he commentedwryly , " but now everywhere I 'm introduced : Urbana , Quincy , Jacksonville , Peoria , the cheerman calls me a man of the people . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called me a candidate of wealth and aristocratic privilege . But what does that really mean , a man of the people ? " " It means a man who can lift two heavy axes in front of him at one time . " Abraham and Logan were elected handily to the state legislature ; Abraham promptly resigned in order to become eligible for the Senate seat . Lyman Trumbull was elected to Congress on his anti-Nebraska stand . It was a stunning repudiation of Stephen Douglas . When all the state legislature returns were in , Abraham said : " Let 's draw up a list , and we 'll see how we stand . "  |p252She  helped him make a chart on a large piece of brown wrapping paper : in the combined House and Senate there would be forty-one Democrats , thirty-seven Whigs and nineteen anti-Nebraska Democrats , bringing the sum of anti-Nebraska men in the combined Houses to a robust total of fifty-six votes . " It looks good , does n't it ? " she asked eagerly . " You need only fifty-one votes : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere else to go . " " Things look hopeful , Puss , but we 're going to have to work hard while treading lightly , picking up votes without offending the fifty-odd others who want the post . We have a rash of letters to write , just as we did when we wanted that nomination for Congress ; we must suggest td our friends that we will be very grateful if they could make a mark for me among their members . " Some two weeks later they learned that the first election in Kansas had not gone so peaceably as had the one in Illinois ; hundreds of armed Missourians had crossed the river and forcibly stuffed the ballot boxes to elect a pro-slavery delegate . The enraged north cried , " Protect yourself ! If you do n't have the arms , we 'll send them to you ! " And so Stephen Douglas 's theory of popular sovereignty in the Kansas-Nebraska Territorieshad broken down the first time it was tried . By New Year 's Day Abraham had been established as the favorite for the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are my choice above all others , " one from Peoria said , " All the good Whigs are for you , " another from Knoxville promised , " I am for you against all others , " while another from Peoria said , " A large majority of the people who voted for me expect me to vote for you . " A Mr. Strunk wrote from Kankakee , " I 'd walk a hundred miles to vote for you . " Mary once again made Julia her confidante , telling her of their election strategy , of the letters of support that were coming in , and the number of pledged votes . " Julia , I 'm overjoyed that you and Lyman are going to be in Washingtonwith us . How much easier it would have been for me that first time . if I had had you there to confide in and discuss my problems with . We must go house hunting together so that we can find homes within eggborrowingdistance . " " We 're going to a boardinghouse , " Julia replied soberly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On January I , they had twenty-six votes assured them ; by the beginning of the second week their chart showed thirty-five ; and by the middle of the month , forty-four , just seven votes short of the number necessary for election . James Shields would receive the forty-one Douglas-Democrat votes ; Lyman Trumbull was the first choice of anti-Nebraska Democrats ,  |p253but  Lyman was content with his election to the Congress . Her cousin Logan assured them : " No one has a chance but you . We 'll have those last seven votes corralledby the end of the week , and you 'll be elected on the first ballot .. . second , at the latest . " That night Mary was so happy she could not sleep . The next morning she learned that Mayor William Herndon refused to come out for Abraham Lincoln on the ground that his friend Richard Yates , who had been defeated for re-election to Congress , also wanted the office ; that as individuals he owed them both a peculiar friendship : " But not one above the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew into a rage . " That ingrate ! He owes you nothing ! That fine partner you 've clasped to your bosom . Billy 's loyal , ' you said . He 's not loyal , let alone dedicated to you . " Abraham took her in his arms , kissed away her righteous indignation , said wistfully , " Only a wife can be dedicated . " THE new network of railroads linking Illinois cities was making conventions popular , and on Friday , January 19 , the legislature adjourned in fine weather to take the train for the conventions being held over the week end in Chicago . Abraham did not go , but Stephen Logan and Simeon Francis went along to hold the Lincoln structure together . The balloting for United States senator would begin as soon as the legislators returned . When Julia came in for tea that afternoon Mary confided excitedly : " There 's a wonderful caterer in Chicago who brings in all the food already cooked , as well as the china , table linen and coffee urns . I 've ordered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same train with the legislators . I 'll have my victory dinner ready the moment the balloting is finished . " Julia was quiet for a moment , then asked tentatively , " Mary , might n't it have been safer . . . elections do sometimes go awry . . . to wait for the result ? " " Oh no , Julia , then I would have had to use one of the local hotels , and we 're all so tired of their set dinners . They tell me this Chicago caterer serves the most delicious foods . .. with French sauces we 've never tasted in Springfield . "  |p254Snow  began to fall , the wind whipping it down with hurricane intensity . By the time it stopped , at five o'clock Sunday afternoon , the town was closed in . Most of Monday was spent digging paths from the houses to the square . All trains had been brought to a dead stop in the drifts . . . and the legislature turned up missing . Mary was uneasy ; what would happen to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train ? It was three days before a train limped in from Alton ; a telegraphic dispatch informed Springfield that their legislators in seven passenger cars were still marooned on the prairies , twenty miles from the nearest town . and that they would have to be brought in by teams . On the evening of January 30 , after another storm had increased the height of the drifts , Mary and Abraham went downtown to the Masonic Hall to hear BoothroydEmmett read Richard III , seeing the first gas-lighted stores and street corners . The Lincolns were planning to have gas installed in their home if the experiment proved successful , and not too many people extinguished the light by blowing it out . The legislature was ten days late in getting back to Springfield . The first one to reach the Lincolns was Eliza Francis , who plowed her way up from the station bursting with news . " My dear , we had a perfectly harrowing time ; none of the snowplows could get through . Everyone was starved . On Monday morning we saw the smoking chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men volunteered to go on a foraging expedition . They returned with a wash boiler filled with coffee , bread , butter , potatoes and eggs . By nightfall we were hungry again , and that 's when I learned that your caterers were in the baggage car with all that wonderful food . The men put up their cash and we bought your dinner . They tore out the woodwork and the seats of the cars and split it into firewood , and we had a fine meal . You saved our lives , Mary . We all want to thank you . . . " Mary felt a little strange . " I 'm delighted the food was there for them . But I 'm not sure I like the idea of their eating my victory banquet in advanceof the balloting . " " That 's another reason I rushed up here . Sim wants Abraham to know that Governor Matteson 's people have started his political pot boiling ; they think that once Jimmy Shields is through , the Democrat ballots will go to the governor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported this to Abraham he flared with the kind of anger she knew so well in herself . " Matteson would be an impossible choice , " he cried . " He has no political convictions . He refused to commit himself on the Nebraska bill . He would stand for nothing in the Senate . "  | " The legislature was stalled for over a week , " she said lightly , " what better way to occupy their time than by caucusing ? " That evening Elizabeth came over to tell Mary that she wanted to give the celebration party for the Lincolns in the Edwards house . She did not mention Mary 's already-eaten banquet . " We ca n't handle fifteen hundred people the way they did for Steve Douglas 's last levee at the state house , but we can take care of several hundred .... " Election day dawned cold but with a little sun and some thawing . The two Houses of the legislature were scheduled to be called to order at two o'clock . At one o'clock Abraham put on a fresh shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished each other good luck , and then was off for a final conference with Logan at the state house . Eliza Francis called for her a little before two , as excited about the prospects of the election as Mary was . Julia was waiting for them in the lobby . While they were exchanging greetings , Governor Matteson 's wife walked by with her two daughters , who had recently completed their schooling at Monticello Seminary . Mrs. Matteson was a tall and stately woman , beautiful of feature and figure . The women went up together to the gallery overlooking the Hall , which was filled with members of both Houses and , beyond them in all the available space and through to the lobby , hundreds of well-wishers and political managers . It was three o'clock before the Assembly settled down to business . James Shields , the incumbent , was nominated first in a speech which drew sustained applause from the Douglas Democrats ; Abraham was nominated by Stephen Logan in an impassioned appeal to the legislature to strike a death blow against the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignified speech by Senator . Palmer ; Governor Matteson was nominated in a short speech which was received with perfunctory applause . Mary was too excited to keep the tally , so Julia took the pencil and paper from her and during the first roll call marked down each vote as the legislator signified his choice . Every one of Abraham 's pledges came through with a vote ; at the end of the first ballot he had the forty-four votes promised him , James Shields had the forty-one regular Democrat votes , and Lyman Trumbull had five votes from the anti-Nebraska Democrats . Eight votes were scattered . The Speaker added his vote for Abraham . Feeling in the Hall was intense ; Julia put her hand out to grip Mary 's and give it a reassuring shake . Around her the voices in the gallery were saying , " Lincoln needs only seven more votes . . . surely he can pick them up from the anti-Nebraska Democrats . . . there are no extra votes possible for Shields . .. " Julia 's second tally showed Abraham losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though he picked up two others . Cousin Logan had been confident Abraham would be elected on the second ballot ; what had happened ? He lost two more votes on the third count . During the roll call on the fourth ballot Mary began to grow cold ; three more voters switched , bringing his total down to thirty-eight . She saw her cousin Logan rise from his seat and move for an adjournment ; the vote went against him . On the fifth ballot Abraham lost four more votes from among the Fusionists , with Lyman Trumbull getting ten . There was not one vote cast for Governor Matteson . On the sixth ballot Abraham lost two more votes , Lyman Trumbull lost three . Evening had come . The gas lamps were lighted in the Hall . There was a commotion on the Democratic side of the chamber , and Mary watched the color rise in Mrs. Matteson 's cheeks until the alabaster queenly expression was noticeably flushed . From this she knew that they were in for a flank movement : on the opening of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would walk a hundred miles to vote for Abraham , abandoned him , the entire Democratic strength of fortyonevotes went for Governor Matteson , and three other non-Democrat votes as well . Abraham picked up votes , getting back to his thirty-eight of the fourth ballot , while Lyman Trumbull had the inconspicuous total of nine . Mary and Julia both were too stunned to keep a further record , for it was evident on the eighth ballot that Matteson was gaining strength while Abraham was losing it . The clerk announced that Governor Matteson now had forty-six votes , Abraham twenty-seven , Lyman Trumbull eighteen . Mary felt that the fight was between Abraham and Governor Matteson but she soon found that she was wrong : Governor Matteson rose to fortysevenvotes , just four away from election , Abraham fell to the bare count of fifteen , Lyman Trumbull picked up practically all of Abraham 's defaultingvotes and rose to the surprising total of thirty-five . Mary saw Abraham look up into the gallery , gaze at her for a long moment , then walk out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lobby , his hair severely mussed . He walked up to her cousin Logan . The two men had a conference . When Logan turned she saw that he was crushed . Abraham put his hand for a moment on Logan 's shoulder , then walked back slowly out of the Hall . During the next roll call Stephen Logan rose , saying : " The demands of principle are superior to those of personal attachment : I cast my ballot for Lyman Trumbull . " Pandemonium broke as the other fourteen of Abraham 's bedrock supportersrallied to Trumbull 's banner ; and when the tally clerk read the results Lyman Trumbull had fifty-one votes . He was the new United States senator from Illinois.  |p257Mary  jumped up without looking or speaking to Julia , made her way out of the gallery , down the long flight of stairs and into the street . Alone in the house she paced from room to room , torn between rage , self-pity and despair : all of their plans of the many months , all of her hopes had come tumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once again they were totally defeated . It seemed a long time before Abraham came home , came into the back bedroom where she lay face down on the bed , raised her in his arms and kissed her cheek . When she looked up she saw that his face was a battlefieldwith deep lines of retrenchment and the corpses of destroyed hopes ; hut his eyes were resigned . " I see you have assimilated your defeat ? " " Yes . But it was n't easy . " He smiled gently . " Young Henry Whitney , he 's one of my associates in Urbana , came in the office and said he 'd never seen me in deeper depths of melancholy . But I worked the disappointment out of my system . And so must you . " " Oh , Abraham , I 'm so mortified ; every man in that legislature knows about that celebration banquet I ordered from Chicago . In fact they ate it in high glee on that snowbound train ! And I was so positive with Julia about the results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every move we were making , of every promise and pledge that came in . You do n't suppose I hurt you ? That Lyman used the informationHe sighed . " Assuredly not . Trumbull is the soul of honor . " Her good sense returned . " So is Julia . She did try to warn me against ordering the banquet . But , Abraham , is it fair that a man who has only five votes to start with , against your forty-four , should win the election ? Could n't you have hung on longer instead of giving Lyman your votes ? " " I became satisfied that it was the only way to prevent Matteson 's election . That 's why I determined to strike at once and advised Logan and my friends to go for Trumbull. 1 could n't let the whole political result go to ruin on a personal point . I regret our defeat , but I 'm not nervous about it . Matteson 's defeat gives me more pleasure than my own gives me pain . It 's a great consolation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyman will fight as hard against the spread of slavery as f could . This is not an end for us , it is a beginning . " " Another beginning , " she commented . " Are we never to know fulfill-ment ? " " Perhaps in the next world . " He patted her shoulder , then said , " You have to dress . I know you 're going to be the most beautiful woman at the party in your satin and feathers . " " The party ! What party ? It will be canceled now . . . Not a bit of it . Ninian sent me word that the party will be givenp258exactly the same except they 've canceled the orchestra because the Trumbullsdo n't approve of dancing . " " Abraham , you certainly do n't think I am going to any celebration party for the Trumbulls ! " Her eyes were wide with amazement . " Why not ? They were planning to come to the celebration for you . We 've got to be good sports . " " Do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The same rules apply to losers . " " Sorry , but everything in my background is pointed toward making me a good winner . " " Just smile and tell them you 're happy for them . Your friends will admire you for it . " " You mean those loyal friends who stuck their knives in your back this afternoon ? The ones who would walk a hundred miles to vote for you ? " " Now , Puss ! As a matter of fact I 've already invited every one of the anti-Nebraska members of the legislature to a dinner party a week from tonight , even those who abandoned me . " She put on her decollete blue brocaded silk with lace ruffling the upper edge of the bodice , then brushed her hair back on one side , piling ringlets on top of her head . She wrapped herself in a blue wool cloak , carried a lace handkerchief scented with lavender . They got into their carriage and went to Elizabeth 's reception . The front porch was draped with flags . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside and left an opening to Julia and Lyman Trumbull , who were in the center of the room receiving congratulations . Mary felt Abraham grip her arm ; he brought her up to the Trumbulls and , putting out his free hand , said : " Not too disappointed to congratulate my old friend , Trumbull . " Trumbull 's expression was bland as he gripped Abraham 's hand . He said in a voice loud enough for everyone in the room to hear , " I should be congratulating you , Lincoln . You led the fight , you defeated Douglas , you persuaded Illinois to repudiate the Nebraska bill . " Julia 's face had been flushed with happiness , but when she saw Mary she turned pale and lowered her eyes . Had Julia known all along that she would be the victor ? Mary became cold inside . Julia finally looked up and met Mary 's gaze head-on . Her eyes said : I 'm sorry , Mary . Mary 's eyes said , No , you 're not , Julia . You 're happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots on her forehead . She fixed a bright smile on her face and passed among her friends , receiving their condolences . As she crossed the foyer to go into the sitting room her cousin Logan came in the doorway . His pale facep259clouded over when he saw her . He took her hand in his , and said , nearly choking with emotion : " We were permitted to make a race for senator just fast enough to lose money . Once again we Whigs have been rode and rode and rode to death . " When Mary and Elizabeth finally came face to face in front of the buffet table with its sumptuous food and iced champagne , Mary checked her sister 's sympathy by exclaiming , " Looks like I 'm filling the United States Senate with men who once countenanced me . For Abraham 's sake maybe I should have passed him by ? He 'd be in the Executive Mansion by now . " " More likely he 'd still be living in the loft over Josh Speed 's store . . with Billy Herndon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an hour , then they slipped away . As they got in the carriage and drove around the banjo drive to Second Street , Abraham shifted the reins to his left hand and put his right arm about her shoulders . " I 've been doing Mentelle 's an injustice ; you 're a good actress . You convinced everyone . " " Everyone but Julia : I could n't dissemble with her . Hurt pride , I guess . But every time I saw her I turned cold inside . She felt it , I 'm sure . " " Julia will understand . She has a forgiving heart . " " Abraham , what do we do now ? " " This is where we have to make our stand , " he said , repeating the words she had used when he had wanted to run to Oregon . " We wait . . . until Stephen Douglas comes up for re-election . . . " But that 's four years from now ! " . . . then we carry the fight to the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will be a great and deciding election , because by then people will know they have to choose between slavery and freedom . " " Wait . . . as we did in 1843 , wait four years to get one term in Congress . . . four years of saying , It 's Abraham 's turn now . ' " " Yes , Abraham 's turn . . . to work . There never has been a time in our lives when work was so needed , or could accomplish so much . You saw what happened in Kansas last November : that 's only the beginning of the bloodshed .... " They had reached home . She went in the front door while Abraham drove the horse and buggy to the rear alley and put them in the barn . She was standing in the hall , surveying the rooms of her domain and hating them with all her emotional intensity , when he came through the kitchen and the dining room and then into the hall to stand behind her . She whirled about . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked awayp260in his wallet . He has n't been beaten since Cousin Stuart defeated him in his first election in ' 38 . We 'll work and wait four years . . . for defeat in ' 58 . " " This time it will be different : Douglas is wrong , terribly wrong . The years and the bloodshed will prove it . We will be standing with the right . We will win . " He had drawn up to his full height . To Mary he seemed nine feet tall , dwarfing her . He was like a dark pillar of fire standing there , his head thrown back , his eyes ablaze , his mouth , hollow cheeks and dimpled chin resolute . And before his fire , which warmed her ; before his stature , which made her feel petty ; before his strength to stand by principle , which gave her the inner fortitude to stand by whatever life might vouchsafe them ; standing deep in the shadow of her husband and her love , she knew that she was at long last in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She slipped her hand into his , smiled up at him , her eyes clear , her own mouth set in courage and acceptance.  |p261AN  impeccably garbed and groomed eastern attorney by the name of Watson called to see Abraham on business . A very few minutes later she heard the front door close ; Abraham came into the bedroom holding a fistful of money . " Look , Mary : four hundred dollars in cash as a retainer , against a thousand-dollar fee . Do n't that cap the whole ? For a case about mechanical reapers . I figured I 'd have to spend this year picking up the crumbs of my lost practice , but this looks like a loaf of bread . " He immediately became absorbed in the case , going back to his early studies of inventions . Then he traveled to Rockford to spend several days in the Manny factory to learn at first hand the differences between his client 's machine and the reaper of Cyrus McCormick , who had brought the infringement suit . In September he left for Cincinnati where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned at the end of ten days she asked if his argument had gone off well . " I did n't . . . give . . . my argument . When I reached Cincinnati .. . they asked me to withdraw . " " But why ? " He chewed one corner of his lip . " Seems they hired me because the case was supposed to be heard before judge Drummond up at Chicago , and they wanted a local lawyer who might have influence with him . " " But what about the brief you wrote ? " He shook his head . " I gave Mr. Watson my roll of manuscript , told him it was for any use he might care to make of it . They never opened it . But the case was a revelation to me : the finest exhibition of accomplished lawyers conducting a great trial . When it was all over I told them , ' I 'm going home to study law . ' "  | " Abraham , you have the humility of a saint , staying in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " " They made my argument seem elementary . The way they practice law is hardly the same thing as the way we practice here in Illinois . " A few weeks after the reaper suit had been decided a letter arrived at the house from Mr. Watson containing six hundred dollars , the balance of the fee . From the accompanying note she gathered that an earlier check had been returned by Abraham on the ground that he had not earned it . " Did you really return the money ? " she asked . " That 's adding injury to insult ! I shall spend part of it on a new gown for the reception at the Governor 's Mansion . Those high-toned Yankee lawyers may not think you are the smartest attorney in the west , but your wife is going to be the most brilliantly accoutered woman this side of New York . " The newly completed Governor 's Mansion was set back on a knoll , amidst tall trees , with a driveway circling through lush green lawn . Governor Matteson was entertaining all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reception hall on the ground floor and saw before her the magnificent broad staircase , the large high-ceilinged rooms with their crystal chandeliers and floor-to-ceiling windows reminiscent of such Bluegrass houses as Ellerslie and Ashland , her heart was lost . " Abraham , maybe you should have run for governor ? " He laughed , took a firm grip on her arm . " I ought to have bought the Houghan house for you , Puss : then we would n't have to become governor . . . or president . " " We would n't have to , but it might be nice . " At dawn she entered her own cramped hallway and small rooms , waited until Abraham had taken off his coat and vest and sprawled out in a big chair to rest his feet , then spread her satin-skirted hoops about her in a circle on the floor . " Abraham , I have a plan to enlarge our house : we 'll take off the roof , turn those two dormer bedrooms into full-sized rooms , add several more bedrooms behind for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I should never have taken you to that reception . " " We can afford it now ; we are the only ones left in our whole circle of family and friends who are still living in a cottage . " He pulled his knees up under his chin . " I 'm comfortable here . " " Well , I 'm not . I do n't think we ought to be sleeping in a bedroom behind the parlor ; I need a maid 's room and a guest chamber so that when my sister Emilie comes up on her bridal tour with Ben Hardin Helm , we 'll have a proper place to put them . " " But , Mary , " he groused , " we 're just getting on our feet . " " Why do n't we ask a price ? "  |p263Armstrong  and Connelly submitted a bid of twenty-five hundred dollars , " Abraham , you put in thirteen hundred dollars , and I 'll put in the twelve hundred I got last year for the eighty acres Father gave me for a wedding present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to spend your own money . I 'll give you your second story , but not just now , costs are too high . " A few days later he left for the circuit . That afternoon at Frances 's house she learned that Hannan and Ragsdale would take a remodeling job . She returned home and drew up a rough plan of what she wanted , then sent for the contractors . " I have twelve hundred dollars . We can use the old shingles for the new roof ; the ground-floor windows can be preserved as they are . For the additional bedrooms upstairs it wo n't be necessary to run a hall all the way through , we 'll put a small stairway out of the kitchen to serve the back quarters . Do you think you can do it at that price ? " A carpenter spent two hours crawling around the basement , then inside the walls of the dormer bedrooms . Hannan and Ragsdale reported : " We can do it at your price , Mrs. Lincoln , excepting for the tin roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metal man . We guarantee the job wo n't go beyond thirteen hundred dollars . " " Agreed , " exclaimed Mary . " I 'd like it finished before my husband gets home , he 'll be away two months . " The workmen arrived at seven the next morning and began removing the roof . " It 's about time we had a proper house , Mother , " said Robert in a cool , imperious tone . " I always thought this cottage was beneath us . " She moved William and Robert onto cots in the sitting room while the carpenters removed the shingles and rafters , then framed the second -- story wall to twelve feet , with new siding to match the original walnut clapboards . As soon as the roof was put back on and the new windows glazed , she moved all three of them upstairs so that the workmen could take down the kitchen chimney , remove the rear wall and throw a beam across the openingto carry the wall of the second floor . During this time she cooked over the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm , in the back yard . The plan included wood stoves where formerly they had gotten their beat only from the fireplaces ; a doorbell over the tall clock in the dining room ; bookcases for Abraham 's law library in what would now be the rear half of the double parlor . At the last moment she decided against the installation of gas for lighting . She had the roof extended over the front edge so that the house would have the look of a Swiss cottage , painted the building a pale chocolate and the outside shutters a dark green . On the front door she put a black plate , on it in silver Roman characters : A. LINCOLNp264Now Abraham could have his own room in which to read most of the night without keeping her awake . She moved their bed from the back parlor up to the new bedroom , immediately behind Abraham 's , then went into town and bought him the biggest mahogany framed bed she could find ; it was not the nine-foot one she had promised him , but lying cater-cornered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet under the blankets . When the job was finished she stood out in the street gazing at her handiwork ; the house had architectural unity , a certain authority arising from the massiveness of the two floors and high roof in front , and at the same time a touch of charm . She thanked the carpenters for their good workmanship , paid the bill of almost thirteen hundred dollars in cash . The entire job including the selection and papering with wallpapers had taken seven weeks . Abraham sent word that he would finish his court work on the following Wednesday and arrive sometime after dark . She fed the children early , cleaned the kitchen , lit the oil lamps in the parlor and sitting room and the two big upstairs bedrooms facing the street , then took up her seat by the window where she could watch him walking home from the railroad station . It was a pleasant evening ; most of the neighborhood was out , some of the men working in their gardens , others standing around at the corner chatting , the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up the street carrying a blue cotton umbrella . She was faint with excitement . Would he approve ? Would he think she had been shrewd in getting so much accomplished for so little ? Or would he be angry with her for going ahead without his consent ? Abraham stopped halfway up the block and cocked his head to one side at the new building . Slowly , very slowly , he continued along the sidewalk . Once again he stopped . The men standing in groups , the women on their porches fell silent . He left the sidewalk , went out into the middle of the street , came to a point opposite the house and stood studying it , shaking his head in disbelief . Then he started walking up and down in front of the house , his hands under his coattails . Finally he stopped , crossed to the opposite side and approached a group of men standing there . His voice came high through the quiet night . " Excuse me , friends , but I 'm Abe Lincoln . I 'm looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , but when I went away a few weeks ago there was only a one-story house there and now there is a two . I think I must be lost . " The neighbors burst into laughter . Mary 's face burned . She stood concealedbehind the curtains . Abraham left the group and came slowly across the street , headed for the front door , then stopped with one foot on the sidewalk . Through the open window she said in a low tone :  | " Come in , you old fool . Do n't you know your own house when you see it ? " HE loved his big north bedroom with the windows on both sides , his lawbooks in their new shelves in the back parlor , the semi-enclosed south porch . He asked if they could put the guest room into immediate use : their neighbor , the Reverend Noyes W. Miner , was holding a Baptist Sunday school convention and several of his delegates had no place to sleep . Abraham ordered a supply of bricks , extended the wall the length of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a white picket fence . He was still in such a good mood on Sunday morning that he wrote out a check for thirty-six dollars for their annual rent on pew number twenty at the First Presbyterian Church . When he saw that his friend Benjamin Fox , directly across from them in the fifth row , had fixed up his pew with new carpet and cushions for his bride , Abraham whispered : " As a reward for the admirable job you did in enlarging our house , I shall buy you a new carpet and some cushions for your pew , then everyonewill think you are a bride too . " Benjamin Fox owned a store in town where Abraham went to read the abolitionist newspapers to which he would not subscribe himself . After services young Fox said , " Mr. Lincoln , the postmaster is refusing to deliver abolitionist newspapers to my box . Are postmen only supposed to deliver material they agree with ? " Abraham laughed . " I 'll take care of it for you . " The following evening Mr. and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the postman is delivering my papers , only he refuses to put them in my mailbox . He throws them over the transom . " " He must be afraid of catching something , " said Abraham ; then added seriously , " You must overlook it , friend ; feelings are running high over anything that touches slavery . " The proof of this came a few days later when Mary was in the kitchen making custard , and her cousin Stuart walked peremptorily through the hall waving an ink-fresh copy of the May io , 1856 , journal under her nose . " Mary , have you seen your husband 's name at the head of this abolitionist call ? " By abolitionist , Mary surmised , Stuart would mean the new party knownp266as Anti-Nebraska in certain parts of Illinois , Fusionist-Republican in others . She took the paper from her cousin , saw the name of Abraham Lincoln leading a list of over a hundred names calling for an AntiNebraskaconvention in Bloomington . She was puzzled . " I do n't believe Abraham signed this , Cousin Stuart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such just now that he fears to do anything , lest he do wrong . He did attend that meeting of Anti-Nebraska editors in Decatur last February , but that was in the hope of confining their platform to the non-extension of slavery . " " But these Black Republicans will plunge the country into war . Mary , who had the audacity to sign Lincoln 's name ? " One corner of her mouth made an in-sucking gesture of distaste . " Herndon , probably . " " Herndon ! Without authorization ? Then he has ruined him ! Mary , you must go down to the office at once and force him to publish a retrac-tion . " " Sorry , Cousin Stuart , but I do n't talk to the . . . gentleman . I 'm afraid you 'll have to do it yourself . Cup of coffee before you go ? " Stuart studied her face , then said quietly : " Mary , you 're not in sympathy with these Republicans , are you ? They 're a dagger pointed straight at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't want to help precipitate a war . Abolitionism means violence ; that hysterical book , Uncle Tom 's Cabin , has the north so whipped up they 'd be glad to burn down the entire south . " " I agree with you , Cousin Stuart . And I believe Abraham does too . " Apparently she was behind in Abraham 's thinking , for when Stuart obliged Herndon to get express approval for his act , Abraham telegraphed back : ALL RIGHT : GO AHEAD . WILL MEET YOU-RADICALS AND ALL . Had Abraham abandoned the sinking remnants of the Whig party and committed himself to these new Republicans ? She knew that when he had attended the meeting of the Anti-Nebraska editors and they had toasted him as the next governor of Illinois , and after that the next United States senator , he had replied : " The senator part of that sentiment I am highly in favor of , but I should really favor the first , as my wife wants us to move into the Governor 's Mansion . " She had exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now she wished he would come home for a few days before attending the convention so that she could discuss the matter with him ; but he was in Urbana , from there he would go on the cars to Danville and then top267Bloomington . It was difficult for her to be alone during these days of violence : Massachusetts ' Senator Charles Sumner 's vitriolic attack against the south ; the beating of Sumner on the Senate floor by Congressman Brooks of South Carolina ; the sack of the free-soil town of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces in Kansas ; the murder of pro-slavery Kansas settlers by a free-soil zealot , John Brown . When Abraham finally returned home on the second day of June she was in a state of high tension . " So is the rest of the country , my dear , if that 's any comfort to you . I 've never heard so much disunionist talk . But it 's as I told the convention , We wo n't go out of the Union , and the south sha n't : " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Springfield came out against it : Cousin Stuart , James Matheny . they 're mighty angry with you and the Republicans .... " " We simply must consolidate everyone who is against Douglas and his supporters . I 've made up my mind I 'm going to support anyone nominated by the Republicans unless he is platformed expressly on some ground I think wrong . " The picture of her cousin Stuart 's face as he cried , " Black Republicanism : the party is a dagger pointed at the heart of the south ! " crowded her mind . She held her emotion under control . " You have n't spoken in public for seven or eight months ; how was your speech at the convention ? " she asked quietly . " Privately , between you and me , it was the best I ever made . " He blushed . " You remember Jesse Dubois , a staunch Whig from southern Illinois ? He came to the convention under protest but when I finished he said , That is the greatest speech ever made in Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " She dropped into one of the rockers , gazing up at him with big eyes . In Cincinnati , in June of 1856 , the Democratic convention surprised the Lincolns and Stephen Douglas by nominating James Buchanan , who had been minister to Great Britain during the Kansas-Nebraska contest . It was felt that many Whigs of conservative feelings who would have rejectedDouglas and the Democrats would go for Buchanan . Millard Fillmore , now a third-party candidate , she remembered as the man who had thrown the full weight of the White House behind the Compromise of 1850 . Two weeks later in Philadelphia , where the first Republican national convention was meeting , John Charles Fremont , the glamorous trail blazer and author of the western reports which had sent great migrations to California and Oregon , was nominated for the presidency amidst wild enthusiasm . Then to their astonishment some of their friends who had been at the Bloomington convention began a movement to have Abrahamp268Lincoln nominated for the vice-presidency , and with only one night in which to caucus had run up a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballot . " It must be some other Lincoln , " murmured Abraham , " there 's a fellow up in Massachusetts by that name . . . . " On the second ballot William L. Dayton was nominated . Abraham set out to campaign through southern Illinois , even as he had during those days in 184o when she had haunted the Journal office to keep track of his movements ; then he had been trying to convert Democrats to Whigs ; now his aim was to change many of these same converts into Republicans . The severest blow the Republicans suffered was Senator Thomas Hart Benton 's public repudiation of his son-in-law , John C. Fremont , on the grounds that the Republicans were a geographical party and would split the nation in two , that a vote for Fremont and the Republicans was a vote for civil war . " Families ! " snorted Abraham . " If they ca n't support each other , why ca n't they at least keep decently still ? " All right , Abraham , she thought , I 'll keep decently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have serious misgivings . . . in my woman 's heart . Though she kept open house , though there was coffee and cake and sandwiches for the men Abraham brought home or invited for consultation , for the first time since they were married she remained totally outside his political activities . He did not perceive that she was troubled . RETURNING from a swing through the center of the state . Abraham paced the floor and asked exasperatedly , " Why ca n't the Whigs understand that Fillmore has no power beyond dividing Republican strength ? " She looked up from the book she was reading . " These are not easy days in which to see the right , Abraham . People are frightened at the implication of Fremont 's election , they want to make sure above all else that they are not casting their vote for disunion . . " I 'm glad to have them take their time . . . right up to the dawn of election day ! If only they could know what Douglas just wrote to Ninian : ' In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Kansas and Nebraska bill . ' Think of that , Mary : he will destroy the Union , and stand there above the carnage and cry , I am right ! ' That 's why wep269must elect Fremont : Buchanan has no choice , he is committed to let slavery spread into the territories . " She was not convinced . As the campaign progressed , the feeling on both sides assumed a religious fervor . Even in Springfield , which was largely free of northern abolitionists and southern secessionists , friendships were strained , families were managing to preserve their relationships only by concerted effort . Cousin Logan was fighting alongside Abraham , but Cousin Stuart had become a powerful voice for Fillmore , while Ninian Edwards was a Stephen Douglas Democrat . Though she had lived through exciting political jousts since she was ten , and had witnessed the Jackson-Clay contest of 1828 , this was the first time an election had alarmed her . Springfield was plastered with pictures and posters of Fremont . The Republicans were making progress under the banner of : FREE SPEECH , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND VICTORY ! Giant crowds were gathering all over the north to hear speeches about him ; torchlight processions throughout thousands of small towns turned the night streets into streams of fire . A flood of speakers covered the north like grasshoppers , trying to leave it bare of any plant except the Republican ideology , while Longfellow and Walt Whitman , Washington Irving and Edward Everett Hale contributed stirring poems , such articulate journalists as Horace Greeley and Charles A. Dana made their presses thunder with biographies , pamphlets , special editions of newspapers . Half the northern preachers filled their churches on Sunday morning with the new political religion of freedom . Fremont the pathfinder was going to find a path through the impenetrable wilderness of slavery . Or was he ? Mary sat with the newspapers of the south in her lap ; under her very eyes were the deep-seated fears and threats of secession if he were elected . The Washington Union , Richmond Enquirer , Charleston Mercury told her that instant dissolution of the Union would take place if Fremont won . One report of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House with Abraham , read : The election of Fremont would be an end to the Union , and ought to be . The object of Fremont 's friends is the conquest of the south . I am contentthat they should own us when they have conquered us , and not before . Senator James M. Mason of Virginia maintained that Fremont 's electionwould mean " immediate , absolute , eternal separation . " Senator John Slidell of Louisiana declared that if Fremont were the victor " the Union can not and ought not to be preserved . " Nor were the threats originatingp270only in the south , they were coming from Democratic meetings in Philadelphiawhere the speakers and the crowd alike clamored for disunion . Even the London Daily News reported that everywhere its correspondent found talk of the " catastrophe " of a Republican victory . Mail arrived from her family in Kentucky , sorely distressed messages asking why Abraham had joined the Republicans , and when he had become an abolitionist . She wrote back to assure them that Abraham was not an abolitionist , that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interfered with where it existed . As she lay in her new bedroom and heard Abraham pacing in the room in front of hers , she finally allowed her mind to consider another painful prong of her dilemma : If the Republicans were victorious they would replace the Whigs as one of the two big parties of the country . Should Abraham receive the nomination for the United States Senate in the fall of 1858 , he would for the first time in his life be at the head of a majority party . The thing she wanted most was for him to go up to the United States Senate . In addition she had William Herndon to reckon with . He had emerged as the organizing executive behind the Republican activity in Springfield . Had he not literally forced Abraham 's hand by putting his name at the top of the call to the Bloomington convention ? Everywhere she went she saw Herndon 's tireless work behind the scenes ; repulsive as she found the comparison , he had become the kind of executive secretary for the Republicansthat her father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Clay . The deeper Abraham got into the Republican movement the closer he was tied to Herndon , who at last had insinuated himself into the position of seeming to direct Abraham 's fortune and future . Yet here was she , pulling away . The town became quiet after Buchanan 's election . When the New England Society gave a banquet just before Christmas all the family opponents , Stuart , the Edwardses and Abraham accepted invitations to speak together . It was a mild day , just cold enough to be fun , so Mary invited all the children down to the square where most of the town 's youngsters were shooting off fireworks . As she watched them play she congratulated herself on her discretion , for not once during the long and feverish months of the campaign had she let anyone know how she felt about the election . Only Abraham seemed morose ; he grumbled : " I did the labor and got thunder for my reward . Please do n't mention the election , it plagues me some . I ca n't help reflect how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not my tendency to melancholy , it 's just that everything now is as clear as mud , with an old and sick manp271going into the White House , without the strength to stand up to the moral issues . " She consoled him by pointing out that there was a crumb of comfort for everyone : the Republicans had elected William Bissell as governor , and for the first time the state administration would be in the hands of Abraham'sfriends instead of his opponents . This was of extreme importance , he agreed , for the ' 58 senatorial race , particularly since Stephen Douglas 's whirlwind campaign through Illinois had carried the state for Buchanan by a few thousand votes . Though Abraham went to Chicago for the Republican banquet at the Tremont House at which everyone congratulated each other on the state and local victories , he continued to be troubled . People everywhere still were synonymizing Republicanism with abolitionism and war . The name had to be avoided , he declared , until the members could convince the country that they too were a peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start a new paper , the Springfield Republican . " I think the establishment of the paper is unfortunate , " he complained to Mary ; " the time is not yet ripe . I just ca n't subscribe to it . " A few weeks later the first issue of the Springfield Republican was delivered to the house . Remembering how strongly Abraham had not wanted the paper started , and resenting it because of her own fear of the Republicans , she sent the editor a reprimanding message , returning the paper to him . To her astonishment he commented on her message in the newspaper . The town buzzed . Abraham said wanly : " Mary , Mary , corporal punishment is wasted on adults as well as children . Now we 've succeeded in making an enemy of a man who only wanted to be our friend . " " But you told me you had not directed the paper to be left ! " " I meant I could not subscribe to the idea of a Republican newspaper , or help him with money to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent of taking and paying for one subscription . The Democrats are saying that if we Republicans ca n't keep peace in our own family , how can we keep it in the nation ? " After her many months of discreet quiet she had by a single outburst exposed herself . Yet through the incident she made one of her dearest friends : Hannah Rathbun , a young widow of twenty-nine who had moved with her two sons from Rhode Island at the death of her husband , to live across the street with her brother , the Reverend Noyes Miner . Coming upon Mary consumed with anger at herself , Hannah countered with a tale of how her own combustible temper had embarrassed her husband by an act a hundredfold more gauche.  | " The whole town was laughing at me , and my husband was furious , but at the end of a month the others had forgotten and it became only a humorous story between my husband and myself . " Mary took her hand . " Thank you , Hannah , that helps me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their quick tempers , lively conversation and repartee , their love of beautiful clothes . When Abraham was away , Hannah and her boys came to stay with Mary , keeping the house filled with the goodness of her friendship . Mary was able to confide in Hannah her heartbreaking efforts to teach four-year-old Tad how to compensate for his cleft palate . There was such a large part of the alphabet he could not conquer : he said hoak for soak , abhunt for absent , papaday for papa dear . The boy was happy and unaware of his handicap , a lovable imp with a fast-moving mind , but unintelligible to outsiders . From the moment of Governor Bissell 's inaugural in January , there were parties and entertainments almost every night . Mary asked Abraham to take Hannah with them , for she wanted her to meet that part of Springfieldwhich might not be accessible to Hannah through her brother 's church work . This was not always easy for Mary because Hannah was prettier , her humor more gentle , and having been left a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she gritted her teeth and continued to invite her . After a series of fires had burned down whole sections of the square , she and Abraham contributed twenty-five dollars to a fund to buy a fire engine from Boston . Two volunteer fire companies kept the town amused with their bright uniforms , parades and picnics . Elizabeth and Ninian gave a dinner party , Benjamin and Helen Edwards hired a large , horse-drawn omnibus to bring their guests to the Houghan house for a musicale , then Mary and Abraham each wrote out their own invitations for five hundred guests , including the new state officers , most of the legislature , the judges and lawyers to a party . Brown 's Hotel , which had just opened , provided the food and a small orchestra . Heavy rain fell all day . Only three hundred guests appeared . Mary stood in the hall , brilliantly gowned in clear white cockled decollete organdymarked with a shamrock embroidered in bright green , receiving her guests . The food , music and company were sufficiently good to make up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends assured her it was a brilliant affair . To her own surprise she found herself asking people to drop in for a visit any time . They did . Not only the guests come to tell her how pleasant the party had been , but some of those who had been kept away by the rain , and a number who had been obliged to go to Jacksonville to a wedding that samep273night . She was happy to see them , even though she was not formally attired , or her hair dressed , or the house immaculate . She wondered why she had not given herself this easy freedom long ago . Abraham was vexed at the Illinois Central , for whom he had won a major tax case , and spent hundreds of hours defending suits over the Eighth Circuit . With the exception of the first $250 retainer , he had not received a dollar from them . He told Mary that the next time he went to Chicago he would collect the money ; but he returned empty-handed , his face red with embarrassment . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars their official said , Why , we could have hired a first-class lawyer for that figure . ' " " By the Eternal ! " " They refuse to pay . I 'm going to have to get affidavits from the leading lawyers in the circuit testifying that it 's a fair fee for the work done . " She became angry . " Abraham , why do these people think they can insult you with impunity ? First the lawyers on the reaper case , and now the Illinois Central ? " " Guess I do n't have an imposing front , so they kick me in the rear . Judge Davis once accused me of trying to beggar the whole legal profession by my paltry fees . This is the first big fee I 've ever felt justified in charging . . and we 'll collect it , even if I have to go ' all the way to the main office in New York . " " We could go by way of Niagara and Canada , " she said dreamily . " That trip the Honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to campaign through New England and help elect General Taylor . Remember ? " ONCE again Abraham began writing at the worktable in the sitting room . He explained that what he wanted to put down on paper was a new prospectus for the Republican party which would prove that it was not abolitionist , but was the natural successor to the Whigs and the only place where freedom men could go . But such Republicans as William Lloyd Garrison cried , " No Union with Slaveholders ! " Wendell Phillips of Boston said , " The Union is accursed of God , away with it ! " The Reverend Samuel J. May wanted New England to secede by itself if the rest of the north would not ; the Reverend Thomas Wentworth Higginson of Worcester , Massachusetts , cried , " Disunion is destiny . " Other ultras of the north claimed , " We are essentially two nations . "  |p274The  work on the sitting-room table stopped . Then on March 7 , 1857 , three days after President Buchanan in his inaugural address had prophesied peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States Supreme Court read the five-to-four opinion of that court on the Dred Scott case which all of Springfield had followed : Dred Scott was a slave who had been taken to the Territory of Wisconsin , and there had married another slave , subsequently purchased by his master . Returning to St. Louis , the master had brought Dred Scott and his family with him ; but when the master died , Scott sued for his freedom on the basis that , having lived in a free country , he had become a free man and could no longer be remanded to slavery . Chief Justice Taney announced that Dred Scott and his family had not become free by moving north of the Missouri Compromise line for the reason that Congress never had had any right to prohibit slavery in the territories . Mary and Abraham read the Springfield newspaper accounts of the decision in the austere coolness of their parlor . Chief Justice Taney decreedthat Negroes were not included in " that part of the Declaration of Independence which asserted that all men are created equal , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man was bound to respect . " Into Mary 's mind flashed the picture of the public square in Lexington , with Negro families being sold and torn apart . She would not be guilty of believing that the Negro had no rights which the white man was bound to respect ; that would make him little different from the beast of the jungle . She felt deeply sad , yet in a sense , purged . Never again would she temporize , whatever the consequences , for now the issue stood out in all its naked ugliness for even the morally blind to see . Slowly she raised her head and looked at Abraham . He had been right when he said of the Republican party that there was no place else for freedom people to go . She was for freedom ; and now she too had found the right . She stood by Abraham , shoulder to shoulder , even though her shoulder only came up to his floating rib . Next year it was probable that Abraham would be the Republican nominee for the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to stand for re-election . For the first time in their twenty years of intense rivalry the two men would be pitted against each other for the same office . Thanks to the Dred Scott decision , which upheld Douglas 's popular sovereignty , people could now take their stand . She stood by Abraham . Would Illinois ? She was to have her trip to New York ; they were going east to collect the Illinois Central fee that had been awarded them by the Illinois court.  |p275Hannah  Rathbun moved into the guest room with her two children to watch over William and Tad . They were taking Robert with them . She always had known that she would like life in a big city , but New York was an unending source of delight . Nor did the town seem strange : she had been reading New York newspapers for so long that she knew most of the theatres , shops and news of local happenings . They stayed at the Astor House and Abraham took them in a carriage for a sight-seeing tour from Central Park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land to a pleasure ground , down to the Battery Park which had become the city dump . After a ferryboat excursion to Staten Island they walked along the piers ; at the foot of Canal Street they found the S.S. Atlantic and were given permission to go through the big steamship which was loading for Europe . When they came down the gangplank Mary turned to Abraham , saying with a wistful laugh : " You ca n't know how I long to go to Europe . I am determined that my next husband shall be rich . " " Then I 'd better start by collecting that five thousand . " The next morning the Illinois Central officials received them with cold courtesy but no cold cash . On the way out Abraham asked : " Would you like to own a railroad , Mary ? Then you could have a chalked hat and ride free over the line , like I do . If we do n't receive the money by the time we reach home I 'm going to have the sheriff in McLean County attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spur to Europe ? " They had two rnore days in New York . Mary spent the afternoon hours at Bowen , McNamee and Company 's new store at 320 Broadway buying printed muslin delaine , at Nesmith 's lower down on Broadway , where she found beautiful seamless hose and purchased a pair of Ontario blankets , at Lane and Porter 's on Canal Street where she bought herself a threeflouncedorgandy robe . Abraham took her to Niblo 's Gardens for the vaudeville and ballet and the following night to Wallack 's Theatre to see The Merchant of Venice . The next morning they left for . Niagara Falls where they put up at the Cataract House . For Mary the Falls were a matter of scenic beauty , but Abraham brushed off the aesthetic concept by asking : " Where can all this water come from ? I 've never seen any answer in my science books . " When they reached home there was still no money from the Illinois Central , so Abraham had the sheriff seize a part of the railroad property to satisfy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was more money than either of them had seen in a lump sum before . Mary held the check out in front of her . " I feel very rich . I think I will build us a beautiful Bluegrass house . Forty-eight hundred dollars should go a long way toward paving for it . "  | " Twenty-four hundred dollars . The other half belongs to Billy . " She held the check against her bosom . " Abraham , that is n't fair ! You 've spent the better part of your working hours for two years earning this fee . Mr. Herndon never rode circuit , never tried any of the cases , He just has n't earned any part of the money . " " I ca n't divide small sums and walk out with big ones . " " Oh , Abraham , this partnership makes less sense all the time . " He ignored her comment . " I 'm going to invest our half of the money in land out in Iowa . We 'll be rich yet . " Her sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary was also related through the Hardin family , arrived in Springfield to try a case . He was a young version of her handsome cousin Hardin , over six feet tall , with penetrating blue eyes , rich brown hair , an open genial face which managed to be both sensitive and strong . He had graduated from West Point , served for a time in the Second Cavalry , but after attending law school at the University of Louisville and going for one term to the HarvardLaw School he had returned to Kentucky and gone into partnership with his father , a former governor of Kentucky . Mary installed Ben in the guest room ; they found him bright , with quiet manners and a moderate attitude toward the politics that were agitating the nation . When Abraham asked about the feeling of the people in Kentucky on the subject of slavery , he replied : " I think the border states will adopt gradual emancipation . " He looked at Mary , adding , " Your father did good work in that field , Cousin Mary . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think the cotton states can accept emancipation in any form , even if guaranteed payment . You see , Cousin Abraham , it 's not only their investment they 're afraid to lose , it is a whole way of life . They 're frightened that everything they value will be torn from them . " In the fall of 1857 Kansas drew up its state constitution at Lecompton , written after a series of pro-slavery election frauds . Under the new constitutionit became a felony to deny the right of a slaveowner to hold his human property in bondage . When President Buchanan urged Congress to accept the Lecompton constitution so that Kansas could become a state , Senator Stephen Douglas broke with the administration . . . and denouncedPresident Buchanan . Abraham exclaimed : " This is excellent for us : we were split last year in the election , that 's what defeated us ; if Douglas and the administration are split in ' 58 , the chance is we shall win . " His jubilation was short-lived : because Douglas was opposing Buchanan and the effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Republican newspapers which formerly had fought him now maintained that Stephenp277Douglas should be nominated as the Republican senator from Illinois . The opposition papers in Illinois grew caustic , poking fun at Abraham as though he had been outmaneuvered . The Urbana Constitution said : Honorable Abe Lincoln is undoubtedly the most unfortunate politician that ever attempted to rise in Illinois . In everything he undertakes , politically , he seems doomed to failure . He has been prostrated often enough in his political schemes to have crushed the life out of any ordinary man . " Good thing you are not an ordinary man , " Mary murmured . his gray eyes lightened , thanking her for the help of humor . The Lincoln home became the scene of a wake as their friends filed in with dispatches from Washington and the north , reporting that more and more Republican leaders were going over to Douglas 's side : Senator Seward of New York , Simon Cameron , Republican boss of Pennsylvania , the party leaders of Massachusetts . Abraham wrote ruminatively on the backs of old envelopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1858 , with an observation to Mary that the speech would be built around the sentiment he had expressedto her during their days at the Globe when he was writing a circularfor the Whigs : that " A house divided against itself can not stand . " ' When he returned from the state library on the evening of June 15 , where he had rehearsed his speech at the head of a round table of his party leaders , he confessed : " My friends scolded me a good deal about the house divided against itself ' ; they wanted me to change it , but I believe I have studied this subjectmore deeply than they have , and I told them I was going to stick to my text whatever happened . " They were in the rear parlor where he had found her sitting in a low chair by the table reading a new French novel under the light of an astral lamp . She sat immobile , watching his dark face and troubled eyes . " I 'd like to read it to you out loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a lot of words underlined for emphasis : " Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention : " If we could first know where we are , and whither we are tending , we could then better judge what to do , and how to do it . " We are now far into the fifth year , since a policy was initiated , with the avowed object , and confident promise , of putting an end to slavery agitation . " Under the operation of that policy , that agitation has not only not ceased , but has constantly augmented. . -L In my opinion , it will not cease , until a crisis shall have been reached , aid passed. - ' - " A house divided against itself can not stand . '  | " I believe this government can not endure , permanently half slave and half free . " I do not expect the Union to be dissolved  --  I do not expect the house to fall  --  but I do expect it will cease to be divided . " It will become all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was low , deeply moving , filled with intense sincerity . She was silent , the sentences ringing through her head , taking her back to their honeymoon at the Globe , to Abraham saying , " I want to acquire a style , but I still write by ear . " He had his style now , as lucible as anything she had heard . She recalled her early observation that basically Abraham was neither a lawyer nor a politician but a literary man . " It 's beautiful , my dear . How can they object to the house divided ' line ? It comes from the Bible . " " One man said it was ahead of its time , another that it would drive away voters fresh from the Democratic ranks , a third declared it a damn fool utterance ' because it sounds like I 'm advocating disunion and war . " " But you 're only analyzing what has gone before , and what you believe may happen . " " Precisely what I said to them . I said , The time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go down because of this speech , then at least I go down linked to what is just and right : " " Surely they wo n't repudiate you ? " " It 's the election they 're worried about , not the nomination . That should come in tomorrow . " She accompanied him to the state house the following evening to hear him read his speech to a Hall full of shirt-sleeved , perspiring Republicans who at the end gave him a unanimous endorsement for the Senate .. . his election depending upon the Republicans winning a majority of seats in the legislature . After much handshaking they walked up to the Journal office to read proof and make sure the friendly Chicago Tribune representativesent in his report free from error . Walking home through the darkness , Abraham informed her that there would be little money available for the grueling campaign : he would not only have to pay all of his own traveling expenses but would have to contribute to the state-wide fund as well ; and since he would be campaigning too hard to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months . She let her servant go , spent money only for food . He converted their sitting room into campaign headquarters , spreading out before him on the worktable the vote tabulations of the 1856 campaign , estimating how much pressure would have to be exerted in each district to bring it into the Republicancamp . In spite of Mary 's efforts to find Hannah a husband , her friend chosep279her own time for falling in love . Dr. John Shearer was a thirty-one-year-old Pennsylvanian , muscular and genial . Mary acted as matron of honor at the wedding in the Miners ' parlor , then helped Hannah move into a new house immediately across the street on Eighth and Jackson . At the end of the first week in July Abraham held Mary tightly to him . picked up his carpetbag and set off for Chicago to hear Stephen Douglas make the opening speech of the campaign ; and to answer him . Walking back through the sitting room from the front window where she had followed his progress down the street , she saw some writing spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence of the paper which he had headed : Struggle Against Slavery . I have never professed an indifference to the honors of official station ; and were I to do so now , I should only make myself ridiculous . She could not resist picking up the paper and reading on : Yet I have never failed to remember that in the republican cause there is a higher aim than that of mere office . I have not allowed myself to forget that the abolition of the Slave-trade by Great Brittain , was agitated a hundred years before it was a final success ; that the measure had it 's open fire-eating opponents ; it 's stealthy " do nt care " opponents ; it 's dollar and cent opponents ; its negro equality opponents ; and its religion and good order opponents ; that all these opponents got offices , and their adversaries got none . But I have also remembered that though they blazed , like tallowcandlesfor a century , at last they flickered in the socket , died out , stank in the dark for a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell . There were tears in her eyes , a lump in her throat . How beautifully he expressed his belief in the right . He had started out on this new campaign only a few moments before ; was he already reconciled to another defeat ? THE Chicago newspaper accounts of Abraham 's first entanglementreached Springfield before he did . His friends had been accurate in their prophecy ; because of the " house divided " speech Douglas accused him of being a disunionist plumping for war . Stephen , Mary knew , had come into Illinois under the severest handicap of his political career , attackedby President Buchanan and the administration forces , abandoned by many Democrats who had been repulsed by his repeal of the Missouri Compromise . But now he had an issue , one provided to him ready-made by Abraham.  |p280She  sat on the floor and , surrounding herself with the two newspapers and her three sons , read to them first from the Douglas paper , the Chicago Times , and then the Lincoln paper , the Chicago Tribune , trying to explain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing could appear true , when there was a ringing of the bell above the clock in the dining room . She opened the front door to find Helen Edwards standing there . She led her into the parlor , which seemed cool and unused after the cluttered sitting room . Helen said : " Mary , I have unpleasant news ... " .. . nothing about Abraham ? " " Oh no , nothing personal . " She spoke more quickly . " Ben has gone over to Stephen Douglas . I know that will hurt , your husband has been kind to Ben . " Mary could feel the blood rush to her head . Could Abraham have been so wrong about his speech that even his friends hurried to desert him ? " What I came to tell you , " Helen continued , " is that Ben is planning the Springfield welcoming reception for Mr. Douglas at our house . The train bringing him will stop alongside our grove . Douglas will make his major Springfield speech right there , " Mary winced : the Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen put a fingertip solicitously on her arm , then started for the front door . " Now I have to go home and write a letter to my Republican family in New York , trying to explain why my husband , after saying in ' 56 , I 'd rather shake hands with the devil than to hold Douglas 's hand on his slavery issue , ' has switched to the Democrats . " Abraham returned the next day ; when she told him about Benjamin Edwards and the Houghan grove rally he swallowed scrawnily a few times , then said , " Every man must go his own way . " He added , " You read about Douglas 's triumphal entry into Illinois ? That is all bombast , Mary . Judging by the strong call for me to speak when he closed , I believe we could have voted him down in that very crowd . " The following morning he took the cars for Bloomington where Douglas was scheduled to speak . " I do n't know if there will be any opening for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance . " After the Bloomington meeting he would board the campaign train that was coming into Springfield with the Douglas enthusiasts , and join the other members of the train when it stopped at Benjamin Edwards 's grove . Late that night as she lay sleepless in bed she heard the faint sound of rain on the roof , then a heavy downpour . This would turn the Edwardses ' grove into a vast field of mud . She murmured gleefully , " Lord , forgivep281me for my uncharity , but I hope You rain out the whole meeting ! " She was awakened at daylight by cannon fire . With a flush of anger she realized that the cannon had been fired by the Douglas Democrats . The cannonading continued all day ; by midmorning she heard the sound of the bands assembling in the square and the Democratic marchers beginning their cheering and parading . The speaking would take two hours , perhaps three ; it seemed a long wait until Abraham would be home again . She went to the front window to see if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a carpetbag in one hand , an unopened umbrellain the other , with his coattails flying in the breeze and his head craned forward , was Abraham . She led him into the kitchen where he took off his wet shoes ; she got him dry socks and brought the crocheted slippers on which she had beaded A.L . He leaned his chair against the wall and sat with his heels locked into the lower rungs , his knees on a level with his bemused and twinkling eyes . She poured him a cup of strong black coffee , then put more wood into the stove and cooked him a fresh lake fish she had bought at Smith and McCandless . Neither of them referred to the fact that he had changed his mind about hearing his opponent speak that day . By the time the meeting was over and the crowd had thronged back into Springfield the town was agog with the news of Douglas 's private railroad car . Robert asked if he could go down to the station to see it . An hour later he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the length of the car , the plush parlor chairs , the lounges where people could sleep , the tables for writing and eating , the brass band , two stenographers , a sculptor , a man to take down his speeches in the new method called short hand .. . and the flatcar which carried two cannon . " Father , when you go out again on the Douglas-Lincoln campaign , are you going to have a beautiful car like that ? " " Why do you call it the Douglas-Lincoln campaign , Robert ? " asked Mary . " In this family we speak of the Lincoln-Douglas campaign . " Robert kept his eyes on his father 's face . Abraham replied : " The Illinois Central appears to be providing this private car to Douglas without too much charge ; apparently they think he is going to be re-elected . " " Why do you have to ride in a day coach ? Why ca n't we have a train called The Lincoln Special ' ? We 're just as good as Douglas , are n't we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend bought up half of Chicago when it was a wilderness . " Robert drew himself up , stuck his chin in the air , and announced , " When I get to be a man I 'm going to be as rich as Senator Douglas . I 'll have niy own car when I travel , and no one will ever be able to look down on me. "  | " Then you 'd better grow another couple of feet in stature , son , " corn mented his father dryly . Abraham had announced that he would speak that evening at the state house . They dawdled over supper , then he bathed , put on fresh linen and his lightest-weight black alpaca suit . Mary was curious to see the new Mrs. Douglas , Stephen 's first wife having died in childbirth almost five years before . Abraham brought the carriage around to the front door . Because they were a little early they rode their buggy around the square . As they came to the St. Nicholas Hotel where the Douglases were staying , their horse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her vantage point high in the carriage Mary saw Stephen Douglas emerge from the ladies ' entrance on the west side of the building with Adele Cutts on his arm . Mary had heard a good deal about the new Mrs. Douglas : the grandnieceof Dolly Madison , she had been raised in the highest Washington society ; it was rumored that she always had had a great many men at her feet and could have married anyone she chose . She was reputed to be the most charming hostess in the capital . Her home had taken away the social leadership from the White House as run by President Buchanan and his niece , Harriet Lane . In the strong light of the gas lamps Mary saw that the reports of Adele Cutts 's beauty were true : Mrs. Douglas had an exquisitely shaped oval face with large brown eyes , a Grecian forehead , with heavy braids of glossy chestnut hair entwined on her head . She was elaborately gowned in silk taffeta with a tunic of embroidered white Italian gossamer , showing off her tall , well-proportioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handsome , prosperous , enormously successful couple , strong emotion welled up in Mary 's bosom : frustration , envy , hatred ? She did not know ; she knew only that she could hardly breathe , her heart was pounding so fiercely in her throat . " Drive on , Abraham . It 's time for your meeting . " The Hall of Representatives was barely full ; Senator Douglas was not coming to hear his opponent , and so the Democrats remained out in the square . Abraham had been speaking for only a moment when a gigantic rocket went off near the window . He said , " I expect we shall have as much of that as we can conveniently get along with , " which brought a laugh from the solid Republican assembly , then went on with a recounting of the disadvantages under which the Republican party was working , includingthe unfair representation in the legislature which had been apportionedyears before when the population was greater in the south : " Senator Douglas is of world-wide renown . All the , anxious politicians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at no distant day , to be president of the United States . They have seen in his round , jolly ,  |p283Fruitful  face post offices , land offices , marshalships and cabinet appointments , chargeships and foreign missions bursting and sprouting out in wonderful exuberance ready to be laid hold of by their greedy hands . On the contrary nobody has ever expected me to be president . In my poor , lean , lank face nobody has ever seen that any cabbages were sprouting out . " She did not enjoy the laughter that followed . When they reached home , and Mary had changed into the robe she had bought in New York , she brought iced lemonade up to Abraham 's bedroom where he was sprawled cater-corner on his bed , his hands under his head . Without bringing his eyes down from the ceiling , he asked : " What did you honestly think ? " " The end was good . " " And the beginning ? " " When you spend half your time answering Steve you are giving him half your platform . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sayingthat your crowds are small ; might not that be because you 're trailing Douglas instead of going out on the stump yourself and initiating the issues of the campaign ? " " You think I 'm hanging onto Douglas 's coattails ? " He sampled the flavor of that thought for a moment , working his lips up and down . " Severalfriends have said I ought to go on the offensive . What about Greeley 's suggestion in the Tribune the day after Douglas and I spoke at Chicago : We trust Messrs . Lincoln and Douglas will speak together at some fifteen or twenty of the most important and widely accessible points throughout the state ' ? " " You mean a series of debates ? Excellent ! " Her eyes glowed at the suggestion . " There 's no more exciting theatre in the world than two men pitted against each other on a platform . Every newspaper in the country would report it . " He sat up abruptly . " I 'll have to propose it to Norman Judd and other friends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concur . " " But will Steve ? What does he gain ? " " Look at it the other way . Can he afford to refuse ? " ABRAHAM left to consult with his advisory committee and to issue the challenge to Douglas . Stephen 's answer came in the form of ap284letter . She could not resist opening it . After reprimanding Abraham for not inviting this arrangement while they were both in Springfield and Douglas was drawing up his campaign , he then agreed to debate him in Freeport , Ottawa , Galesburg , Quincy , Alton , Jonesboro and Charleston . She danced around the sitting room waving the letter above her head . When Abraham returned the next morning she asked : " Abraham , could I come along for the debates ? I think I could be as much of an asset to you as Adele Cutts is to Steve . " " No question of that , Puss , but the Douglases can afford to spend a great deal of money on this campaign . We 're spending our meager savings . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd have to spend hours in dirty railroad stations , travel in crowded day coaches . . . sometimes sit up in the cars all night . . . " " I wo n't mind . Remember our trip to Vandalia for the big Whig convention ? I made a great many friends there . " He moved his head from side to side . " It would be better if you met me at the strategic points . I 'd have the freedom of mind to slog on day by day . " She was disappointed . They had a quiet two weeks preparing for his swing through the smaller villages prior to opening the formal debates at Ottawa . Then on a hot Friday morning toward the end of August she boarded the cars . It was a rough jolting journey ; she half suffocated for lack of air , breathing in draughts of black soot . By the time she reached the halfway mark her traveling dress of dark blue muslin was covered with dust and ash . She had prepared herself a small lunch but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time she reached Morris , a tiny village with houses nestled among green shade trees . Abraham was at the station to meet her . They stayed with friends overnight , and the next morning went down to the station to board the seventeen-car Republican special , jammed with their supporters . It was shortly after noon when they reached Ottawa . They were escorted from the train to a carriage which had been decorated with evergreens and mottoes by the young Republican ladies of the town ; in front of them were bands of music and behind them military companies . The procession circled the square to the sound of cheering , then made its way to the residence of Mayor Glover , who was standing on the porch of his two-story red brick house ready to give them an official welcome to this northern and hence predominantly Republican town . A holiday mood prevailed over the town , the stores and streets were scrubbed , banners and streamers hung . The square was a seething mass of humanity , some ten thousand people who , the mayor told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on horseback , in carriages , farm wagons , special trains and canal boats up the Illinois and Fox rivers , thep285town being surrounded by campfires of those who had come in for the great show . In the middle of the square was an improvised stand with a plank coveringto keep off the merciless sun ; no one had remembered to keep a lane available to the stand , and so a military company leading the Lincolns fought its way inch by inch , taking a half hour to get through . From anotherdirection Mr. and Mrs , Douglas and their Democratic entourage were undergoing a similar ordeal . Finally they were all seated on the platform , she and Abraham on one side with their delegation , Douglas and his wife on the other . Across the stand Mary saw Adele Cutts Douglas gazing at her . Below them was a table filled with reporters from most of the important newspapers of the east , as well as short hand writers . Douglas had the opening speech and the rebuttal . He was dressed in a ruffled silk shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily in a rushing unbroken stream , his voice heavy and rich ; he shook his long black hair , walked back and forth across the platform with the springing grace of a panther . Mary remembered him as she had known him in the early days of Springfield ; what power he had developed . what amazing qualities of leadership . His questioning of Abraham about the Springfield Republican platform was greeted with cries of " Hurrah for Douglas ! " " Hit him again ! " She stole a glance at Abraham 's face . He was upset . A number of times he shook his head in confusion and denial . When he rose , wearing a coat with sleeves too short , and baggy trousers , he was greeted with protracted applause ; this cheered her , though it did not lighten Abraham 's expression . His voice was nasal , with an unpleasanttimbre ; the confidence and good nature of the night before were gone , and so was the speech he painstakingly had written at home , tried out and revised in the public squares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack had thrown him off balance . He failed to answer Douglas 's questions , did some patchwork rambling , then stopped speaking altogether after only thirty or forty minutes . She was too apprehensive to hear anything of Douglas 's rebuttal ; she could tell from the tone of the audience that he had had the better of the day 's argument . She was tired ; she wanted to get off the platform , back to Mayor Glover 's house and into the quiet and privacy of the bedroom that had been made available to them .. Then she saw Mrs. Douglas moving toward her . She turned her face , tried to make her way to the steps at the side of the platform . The crowd was too dense . She felt a gentle hand on her arm , and turned . There was no sense of triumph in Adele Douglas , instead she wore a friendly smile.  | " You wo n't remember me , Mrs. Lincoln , but I was introduced to you once a number of years ago in Washington . " Startled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my aunt 's house : Mrs. Madison . You came in for the New Year 's reception . I was only fourteen then , but I remember thinking what exquisiteshoulders you had . I can even recall your gown ; it was white silk with blue brocaded flowers woven through it . " Mary flushed . " Yes , I did wear my white silk that day . Remarkable that you should remember . " " I do n't think so , Mrs. Lincoln . Anyone meeting you for the first time certainly could never forget you . Do tell me , how are you faring on this trip with your husband ? Frankly I would have preferred to remain home . My main task seems to be keeping Mr. Douglas in clean shirts . I 'm not altogether sure I 'm contributing anything to the campaign , though I do my best with the women of the town . " Completely thawed now , Mary held out her hand to the younger woman . " I 'm so glad we 've met , Mrs. Douglas . Do let us be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I envy your being able to make the whole trip . " That evening the short hand man brought in Abraham 's speech , transcribed to long hand for the newspapers . Abraham read it , turned to Mary with a wry smile . " I say , as the old man did when he saw his daguerreotype : it 's most horribly like me ! " He laughed , then sprang up from his chair and exclaimed : " I 've got it ! Douglas played us double . That set of abolitionist resolutionshe outlined never was passed in Springfield , and never was the Republicanparty platform . They were passed by some abolitionist county group up in the north . That 's what had me so upset . It was probably an honest mistake , but I 'm going to confront him with it at Freeport . " There was no sleep in him that night . He paced the floor of Mayor Glover 's upstairs bedroom overlooking the deserted street and sleeping village . " I 've used a lot of Douglas 's ideas in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me a series of embarrassing questions today ; next week I 'll ask him some , and with one of them I think I can embarrass him right out of the election . " " Truly ? We 've been trying to dispose of him for twenty-two years withoutthe slightest success . How can you find such a thrust fatale ? " He went to where his stovepipe hat was sitting on a marble-topped table , bottom up , and dumped out some old envelopes . " This is roughly how the question should read : Can the people of ap287United States territory in any lawful way exclude slavery from its limits prior to the formation of a state constitution ? ' " She repeated the sentence to herself . " Douglas has been upholding the Dred Scott decision ; therefore in all legal logic he has got to answer in the negative : that the citizens of a territorycannot exclude slavery , because with the Missouri Compromise dead , slaves can not be excluded anywhere . " " If Douglas answers ' No , ' " said Mary ruminatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra-slavery votes in the southern counties . Is that it ? " Abraham was pleased at his stratagem ; he went to the front window , took several draughts of air , then got into bed . " I can sleep now . " She was cutting out the first newspaper reports of the debate in Freeport when her cousin Logan came to call , his face a series of contorted whorls . " Mary , what happened to us at Freeport ? " he cried in a high shrill voice . " Why did Abraham ask Douglas that question ? " Mary thought the Freeport debate had gone well in spite of the wind and showers : Douglas had apologized to a crowd of fifteen thousand listenersfor quoting the wrong platform at Ottawa ; all the important newspapersof the country had carried their speeches in full . It was the first time Abraham 's words had had a national audience . " Abraham had Douglas locked tight in that Kansas cavern , and now he has willfully unbolted the ddor and let him out . They 're saying all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got it lost . " " Sit down for a moment , Cousin Logan , I 'll get you some coffee . " She deliberately took her time , for she could hear her cousin pacing nervously in the sitting room . She poured two cups of very thick black coffee . Logan pushed his aside . " I hear some of our best men advised Abraham against asking Douglas that question . Why does he go contrary to good advice ? " She recalled his refusal to withdraw his " house divided " sentiments from the Springfield speech . " I do n't know , Cousin Logan ; but he has to do what he thinks is right . " Logan took up the Freeport clipping and ran a jagged fingernail under the lines of Douglas 's answer : " The next question propounded to me by Mr. Lincoln is , can the people of a territory in any lawful way . . . exclude slavery from their limits prior to the formation of a State Constitution ? I answer emphatically that in my opinion the people of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits . . . . The people have the lawful means to introduceit or exclude it as they please , for the reason that slavery can not exist a day or an hour anywhere , unless it is supported by local police regulations . ' " Logan held her in a troubled gaze . " How clever that answer is : it 'll win him every old-line Whig vote in the state ! " As she stood looking at her cousin she remembered how he had wept when Abraham had been defeated by Trumbull for the Senate seat three years before . What could she say to him ? That Abraham had been wrong ? That he had made a ' tactical blunder ? She who had watched his slow , troubled awakening , lived side by side with the impetus of his growth and maturing , seen and heard him reach the selflessness of dedication to a humanitarian cause ? Should she now doubt his judgment ? She put her hand on her cousin 's shoulder , fondly . " Abraham knows best , Cousin Logan . We must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on September i , he was home , his face bronzed from exposure to the sun , his voice strong in spite of the fact that he had been speaking in open-air groves every afternoon , and in town squares in the evenings . If the election were already lost , certainly no one could find any sign of it in Abraham . He had a number of stories for her and the boys as they gathered about him in the kitchen while she prepared a beefsteak for supper : of how the caboose of the freight train he was riding had been sidetracked in the hot sun for several hours to let the Douglas special go by ; how the French harp he had learned to play on the long day-coach journeys had become known as the rival of Douglas 's brass band . Robert brought out the brilliant uniform which the Springfield Cadets had had made to wear on the excursion train which would go to Alton for the last debate . " You must come too , Mary , " said Abraham . " You saw the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end . " After supper he settled down at the worktable beneath his law shelves . When Mary asked in surprise if he were still writing out every speech in advance , he gazed at her over his spectacles . " Now , take your old friend Douglas , he has a theory that the popular sovereignty speech is the one he is going to win on , and the audiences whom he addresses in each town will neither know nor care whether he is making the same speech elsewhere . For my own part , I can never repeat a speech a second time . Everything about the subject keeps enlargingas I go from place to place , and what seems to me like new truths come crowding in on me . " The next two weeks , while she followed him by the newspaper reports ,  |p289he  traced a pattern across the valleys and prairies of Illinois , on horseback , in carriages , on railroads or canals or riverboats , speaking in rapid successionfrom Monticello to Mattoon , from Hillsboro to Edwardsville , from Highland to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held at Jonesboro , deep in the south of Illinois , went badly for both of them , since the county was dominated by Buchanan Democrats ; however in Charleston , the capital of Coles County , there was an enormous banneracross the main street which read OLD ABE THIRTY YEARS AGO , showingAbraham driving two yoke of oxen . The papers estimated that some ten to twelve thousand people had come to hear their adopted candidate ; chief among them , Sarah Bush Lincoln , his stepmother . Her other newspaper reading was not as pleasant : the Lexington Observer and Reporter , which she still received by mail , informed her that the Kentucky Whigs , which meant her entire Kentucky family , were unanimously in favor of Douglas over Lincoln . Such old family friends as John J. Crittenden and James B. Clay , son of Henry Clay , also favored the election of Douglas . At the end of September Abraham managed to get home for a week end , coming in late of a Saturday afternoon . She had no sooner freshened the upstairs bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican Club came marching down the street headed by a band , assembling almost a thousand strong in front of the house . Since it was obvious that the crowd would not go away until he had made a speech , Abraham linked his arm through Mary 's and the two of them went out on the front porch to acknowledge the cheers . The three boys looked on from the upstairs windows . Abraham thanked their friends for the reception , assured them that the prospects were good for the triumph of the principles that were so dear to all of them . Mary watched the faces of the people as they followed his words , felt the warmth of the community as it flowed upward toward Abraham and herself . She was tremendously moved , it was almost like repatriation ; once again she felt close to the town where so often she had thought herself unhappy and unwanted . ON the morning of the Alton debate she was up at five , building a fire in the stove and heating the bath water for herself and Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to crowd the eight cars of the half-fare excursion train . The trip took four hours ; elevenp290years before , they had ridden the stagecoach from Springfield to Alton and the ninety-eight miles had taken two full days . When she alighted from the cars one of Abraham 's friends led her to where Abraham was sitting in a closed carriage ; he had come down from Quincy on the river boat City of Louisiana the evening before . He reached down both arms to help her into the carriage , kissing her heartily . " I thought it better not to come into the station , or it would take us hours to get to the hotel . Where 's Robert ? " " With his cadet company . They plan to parade about the city before going for their dinner . Did you rest well last night ? " " Went to my cabin after supper and slept till dawn . 1 wish the Rock Island and the Illinois Central would put boats on their tracks . " The carriage stopped at a side entrance of the Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third floor . He had been receiving political friends all morning , but now they were to have a couple of hours of rest and privacy . At one-thirty they left the hotel . " We 'll be before an audience which has strong sympathies southward , " said Abraham . " I 'm sure Douglas is going to try to place me in an extreme abolitionist attitude . " When they reached the stand which had been erected in front of the tall ground-floor windows of the new city hall , she was disappointed to find in the space between the city hall and the Congregational church little more than a third of the number who had assembled at Ottawa for the opening debate . In Ottawa the crowd had been filled with families , mothers carrying children in their arms , young girls as well as grandmothers ; here it was mostly men . Then she saw that the windows of the city hall and all other windows of the square were filled with women gazing down upon them . Promptly at two o'clock Stephen Douglas rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice strained and hoarse . He seemed nervous as he strode up and down the platform , nevertheless his argument was well organized : the government had been established by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity ; the signers of the Declaration of Independence had no reference to Negroes when they declared all men to be created equal , they were alluding to white men and none others ; there was no power under our system of government which had the right to force a constitution on unwilling people , and if the people of Kansas wanted a slave state , they had a right to form such a state , and he would let them come into the Union with slavery or without because it was their business and not his ; and that when he brought forth the KansasNebraskabill its intent was to leave the people there free to regulate their domestic institutions ; that Lincoln , in declaring the " house divided "  |p291doctrine  , had insisted that the government could not endure permanently divided into slave and free states , and consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation to war , resulting in the destruction of the constitution and the government set up by the founding fathers . Half the crowd cheered him lustily when he finished and took his seat . Mrs. Douglas handed him a clean white handkerchief to wipe the perspiration from his brow . Abraham rose , took off his coat . A young woman in the audience threw a bouquet of dahlias and roses at his feet . He picked up the flowers and handed them back to Mary , who held them on top of his coat . She strained forward to catch every word he uttered . He quickly went to the heart of the conflict : " At Galesburg the other day , I said in answer to Douglas that three years ago there never had been a man , so far as I knew in the whole world , who had said that the Declaration of Independence did not include Negroes in the term all men . ' I believe the first man who ever said it was Chief Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case , and the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new principle is brought forwardI combat it as taking away from the Negro the right of ever striving to be a man . " He accused Douglas of reviving the slavery agitation in 1854 by demandingthe repeal of the Missouri Compromise , and asked why , since the " troublesome thing " was on its way to extinction , Douglas had felt driven to the necessity of introducing a new policy in regard to slavery ; whereas " we might , by arresting the further spread of it and placing it where the fathers originally placed it , put it where the public mind should rest in the belief that it was in the course of ultimate extinction . " He maintained that all troubles in relation to slavery arose from an endeavor to spread it . A number of scattered voices cried , " Hear ! Hear ! " Abraham held his arms out in a wide , encircling gesture . " The real issue between Douglas and myself is the sentiment of one class that looks upon the institution of slavery as a wrong , and of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge Douglas says he do n't care whether slavery is voted up or voted down . ' Any man who can say that does not see anything wrong in slavery , because no man can logically say he do n't care whether a wrong is voted up or down . " Douglas contends that whatever community wants slaves has a right to have them . So they have if it is not a wrong . But if it is a wrong , he can not say a people have a right to do wrong . You may turn over everything in the Democratic policy from beginning to end and everything that Douglas has said , and it everywhere carefully excludes the idea that there is anything wrong in slavery . That is the real issue . That , is thep292issue that will continue in this country when these poor tongues of Stephen Douglas and myself shall be silent . It is the eternal struggle betweenthese two principles , that have stood face to face from the beginning of time and will ever continue to struggle . The one is the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kings . It is the same spirit that says , You work and toil and earn bread , and I 'll eat it . ' " Dusk had fallen . Abraham stood above the crowd , every line of his angular body yearning out toward the people who were standing in silence , gazing up at him , not really knowing he had finished , and then when they did . too caught up emotionally to give anything but quiet applause . When the crowd had melted away Mary and Abraham went back to the Franklin House for an early supper before catching the train to Springfield . Robert and the cadets were still parading in front of the Courier office . At supper , on Mary 's right , sat Horace White , reporter from the Chicago Tribune , while opposite her was Robert Hitt , the pioneer of verbatim short hand reporting . The dining room was filled with Republicans , the Democrats being with Douglas at the Alton Hotel . There was an exultation in the air , a feeling that Abraham had brought the campaign to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she looked about the table , that everyone except Abraham was exhausted . Horace White and Robert Hitt fell to comparing notes on their relative amount of work and the meager amount of sleep they had had in the past two months . Mary asked : " Why do n't you young men come home with Mr. Lincoln and myself and rest for a few days ? " Robert Hitt put his elbows on the table , leaned toward her and said with mock severity : " Thank you , Mrs. Lincoln , but I will never visit your home until you live in the White House . " There was laughter around the table . Mary answered wistfully : " Young man , there 's not much prospect of such a residence very soon . " There was no dawn to election day . Leaden skies poured down torrentialrains . Abraham commented that the rain and mud would keep a good many Republicans among the country farmers away from the polls . When she accompanied him downtown , just before noon , they found everyone thoroughly drenched and dispirited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking place in the streets , the constables hauling off the belligerents to city prison . Late that night they walked home from the journal office where they had been tabulating the telegraphic results : although Abraham and thep293Republicans had received a majority of the popular vote , the unfair apportionmentgiving more legislators to the southern counties would unquestionablyresult in a Democratic victory and ' give Douglas his reelectionto the Senate . They were silent as they slogged through the mud . While making their way up Eighth Street Abraham became so immersed in his thoughts that one foot flew out from under him and he very nearly fell . Seeing a flash of pain on his face , Mary asked : " Are you all right ? " He smiled wistfully . " It was a slip , not a fall . " " Then you think there is some chance for us in the future ? " He was silent for a long time . " I 'm glad we made the race , Mary : it gave us a hearing on the great and durable question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wasted : even though we sink out of view and be forgotten , we 've made some marks which will tell for the cause of civil liberty long after we 're gone . " She thought of the writing she had found on his worktable the morning he left for the first speech of the campaign , and once again tears filled her eyes . She slipped her hand into his , felt the return pressure as he laced his fingers through hers . " From now on , Mary , we 'll be fighting in the ranks . " THREE weeks later they were almost blasted out of bed by a thirty-two-gun salute fired for the early morning arrival in Springfield of Senator Stephen A. Douglas . " Hail the conquering hero , " said Mary acidly once the ground-shaking barrage had ended . " Oh , he 's the hero all right , " replied Abraham . " Singlehandedly he crushed President Buchanan and the administration machine ; they 'll have no influence in the I 86o Democratic convention . Douglas will control it , and this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another candidate . The emotions of defeat are fresh upon me , but we shall have fun again . " She rose , poured cold water into the basin , washed her face and put on a starched ruffled morning gown . Then she turned back to the bed , her eyes questioning him sharply.  | " Fun again ? " " The fight must go on . Douglas managed to be supported both as the instrument to break down and to uphold the slave power . No ingenuity can keep up this double position . I have an abiding faith that we shall beat them in the long run . " She brushed her hair , braided it and pinned it at the nape of her neck . When she had quite finished she asked : " Who is the them ' we are going to beat ? And in which fight ? i 86o ? ' 62 ? ' 64 ? " He grinned . " It will come as no surprise to you that I entertain a personal wish for a term in the United States Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Lyman Trumbull 's ? No . He is doing a magnificent job for freedom . I am anxious that he be sustained . I shall go out and campaign for him over the state ... also for whoever the Republicans nominate for the presidency . In 186o we 're going to win ; though I fall early in the contest it is nothing if I have contributed in the least degree to the final rightful result . " " You make everything sound so posthumous , " she replied mournfully , " like that phrase you used in the letter to Dr. Henry , though I now sink out of view . ' It seems to me there 's an awful lot of you just to plain sink out of view . . . as though you had been swallowed by the cat . " " Oh no . Only a couple of days ago I wrote to the Chicago Tribune asking if they could send me two copies of each number of their paper that contained the debates so that I could put them together in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must stick to the courts or we will go to the wall for bread . " And so she went back to her housewifery , Abraham to his lawyering . Since he had refrained from personal invective his campaign had made him no enemies ; by the same token it had made him a great many new friends and spread his name widely on the national scene . Business came to him almost at once , not merely personal cases , but important business matters from the Illinois Central and manufacturing companies . Although it would take long hard hours , the heavy accounts they had piled up at a number of the stores presently would be paid off . The pressure never to spend a dollar except for food was removed . Mary turned her attention to the subject of Robert 's education , for he was going on sixteen and Abraham seemed content to let him attend the infant Illinois State University , in which the Lincolns had bought a scholarshipsome years before . Having been raised within the purlieu of TransylvaniaUniversity and having a basis of contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confine his higher education to what thep295four ministers who composed the Illinois faculty could impart . Abraham seemed surprised . " You 'll want something better than that for your sons , " she said quietly . " It 's already better than anything I had . " " That 's hardly a test , is it ? You want them to have the best in comparisonto what is available : Brown University , or Yale where Cassius Clay went ; Boston is the greatest seat of our culture , and I would prefer Harvard . " He flinched . " From blab school to Harvard ! " " Now , Abraham , do n't behave like a self-made man . Your sons start from where you leave off , not where you began . Those eastern university lawyers frightened you half to death in Cincinnati . " " You 're right , " he said seriously . " I ca n't pull Robert down by the same bootstrap I pulled myself up with . Would my father be surprised to see his grandson in Harvard ! He always told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got along fine without it ! ' But he did n't . Say , do you think Bob will talk to us after he 's a Harvard man ? " The prospectus from Harvard indicated that , come spring , Robert would have to take tests in sixteen separate subjects ; since some of these were only sketchily taught at Estabrook or Illinois State , she gatheredthe textbooks around her and instructed him herself . The studies brought them close together . After the one discussion she and Abraham had had about the campaignon the morning of Douglas 's thirty-two-gun salute , the subject of politics was not mentioned in the house . She was grateful that she had the work with Robert to absorb her time . Abraham seemed grateful that every day brought new law cases to keep him occupied . Then one day in December he returned from the courts at Bloomington with a bemused expression on his face . Over dinner he told her the story . " Mary , you remember Jesse Fell , he owns the Bloomington Pantagraph , maybe the smartest man I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been east , as far as Boston . . . New York , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan and Indiana ; and everywhere I hear you talked about . Very frequently I have been asked , " Who is this man Lincoln , of your state , canvassing in opposition to Senator Douglas ? " I told them we had two giants in Illinois instead of one : that Douglas was the little one , as they all knew , but that you were the big one , which they did n't know . I have a decided impression that if your efforts on the slavery question can be sufficiently brought before the people you can be made a formidable , if not a successful , candidate for the presidency : " She laid down her fork , raised her glass of water in the air and cried , " Hallelujah ! "  | " He thinks that what the Republican party needs to ensure success in 1860 is a man committed against slavery aggression , with no record to defend , and no radicalism ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day an old Democrat from down around Egypt said to me , Abe Lincoln , they say you are a self-made man . ' I answered , Well , yes , what there is of me is self-made . ' Well , all I got to say , ' observed the man , after looking me over from head to foot , is that it was a damn bad job ! ' " It was the first joke he had told since his defeat ; she long ago had noticed that he had a tendency to tell self-deprecatory jokes at those moments when he was relating the highest compliments that had been paid him . " Fell asked me to write him the story of my life so he could send it east and have it published . " " Good ! You write him a fine interesting piece . I can conceive of no better way of fighting in the ranks than by being the commanding general . " " Now , Mary , I 'm not going to write the article . " " Why not ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't feel myself fit for the presi-dency . " She raised her eyebrows in disbelief . " That weak , obtuse , third-rate county politician Franklin Pierce was ? And surely Old Obliquity ' Buchanan is ; using his full time and power trying to crush Stephen Douglas instead of governing the country . " " I was n't thinking of Franklin Pierce or James Buchanan , Marv , but of Thomas Jefferson . " " That 's a bootless activity ! Today Stephen Douglas is the national hero . is he a Thomas Jefferson ? " " I 'd certainly like to come to grips with him again , " he replied pensively . Then he continued in a humble tone , " Fell paid me a handsome compliment , and I 'll admit I 'd like to be president , but it is only horse sense to keep our ambition within attainable limits . " When by dint of great effort they got together a set of the debates they spent their evenings at the worktable cutting out the columns and pasting them in sequence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for either of them : as he sat across from her , his gray eyes , which had been so light and clear during the campaign , became dark and confused . He had felt keenly disappointed but not disheartened by his defeat , and had told his friends over and over : " I have no regret for having made the struggle . " Now a weariness set in : it was not merely that he seemed of two minds , but more nearly of two hundred . Was he convinced that he would have to fight in the ranks ? When he wrote to Dr. Henry did be sincerely thinkp297he was going to sink out of view ? Now that his days were quiet and removed from the excitements of the fight , now that he had returned to the practice of law , was he feeling the impact of fatigue and discouragementarising out of still another , defeat ? Would he be content to wait six full years before again trying to get himself elected to the Senate ? Could the satisfaction of blows struck for civil liberty sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert him except Billy Herndon , Did he genuinely believe that he was unfit for the presidency ? Then why was he planning this scrapbook , writing to his friends that there was some chance the debates soon would be published when actually there had been no reference to it outside the Lincoln household ? He seemed to be inching slowly toward a resolution that if the nomination were availablehe would go out and work for it ; then he would write to political friends : " I really think it is best for our cause if no concerted effort for me be made . " When the unrest and lethargy , the past-election doldrums set in for him , what would the tension demand of her ? Abraham did not want a party for his fiftieth birthday , muttering something about there not being anything very much to celebrate , but she declared it an occasion she could not let go by . She sat down and began writing out invitations : Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln 's compliments for Wednesday , at seven o'clock . She had not meant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited over a hundred couples . The day was cloudy and remained dismal straight through to night . She swore that all she had to do was announce a party in advance for the weather to turn bad ; but by eight o'clock when she stood in the entrance to the double parlors where there was a bright and animated hubbub of people talking and dancing , and began counting heads , she saw that there was a couple present for every invitation she had issued . Abraham came to her side , slipped an arm gently about her waist . " It 's the nicest fiftieth birthday I ever had . " He kissed the lobe of her ear exposed below her heavy braids . She was happy she had made the effort . Toward the end of February he went to Chicago to take care of some law cases and parenthetically to be on the ground for the first big Republicanmeeting to be held since the last campaign . He was doing better at the law than ever before , there was money for her to buy whatevershe wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ap298shop in Springfield ; but neither she nor Abraham drew much sustenance from their financial success . With spring , her headaches returned . She kept her malaise to herself , gritted her teeth and went about her tasks , knowing that this was the penalty of recurrent defeat . When the pain became severe or she felt temper welling up within her , she tried to hide for a few hours in her room , lying on her bed ; but there she was overwhelmed by questions , doubts , pictures out of the past , and sensitivity to Abraham 's depression . How much of their lives had been spent in vain hoping and exhausting repulses ! Abraham said that Stephen Douglas had a genius for attracting victory ; could it be they had a genius for attracting defeat ? Surely they had had their fill of it . And this time they had lost with all the signs and forces in their favor . Jesse Fell was talking about Abraham 's running for the presidency ; but under what conceivable set of circumstances could he triumph over such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally famous and respected leaders of the Republican party ? These men had been governorsof great states , United States senators for many years , with a vast national reputation and body of public service behind them , with unlimitedsupplies of money and groups of supporters . In the southern newspapers she continued to read editorials and reports of meetings which maintained that if a Republican president were elected in 1860 the gulf states would secede . Should any person in his right senses aspire to the White House under such conditions ? She became restless , the room seeming to close in upon her . She would jump up , bathe and dress , return to her routine . SPRING settled early into a long hot summer . Abraham wrote letters , made an occasional speech , followed Douglas 's movements closely . They received shocking news from Cambridge : Harvard University reported that Robert had failed his examinations in fifteen out of the sixteen subjects ! This was not only a critique on Springfield 's educational facilities but a devastating comment on her own months of tutoring the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own doing , for Abraham had not wanted the boy to apply to Harvard in the first place . Tad too filled her with apprehension and dread , for he had never overcome his speech impediment ; no one outside the family could- understandhim , the children of the neighborhood were beginning to sayp299unkind things about him . It was impossible to send him to school . . . he would not be accepted . What would happen to him when he had to earn a living in an adult world ? He was bright , courageous , but who would know it if no one could understand him , if people hearing him for the first time thought he had a defective mind ? The younger boys ran wild . Hearing them wailing in the back yard , she cried : " Abe , what is the matter with the boys ? " " Just what is the matter with the whole world , " he replied sadly , " I 've got three walnuts and each wants two . " Robert ran into the sitting room with Tad clinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in his hand . " Oh , let him have it , Bob , " his father said , " to keep him quiet . " " No , " replied Robert , " it is my knife and I need it to keep me quiet . " Sometimes Abraham would take William and Tad down to the office : he refused to exercise any control over them , and they would scatter the legal papers over the floor , pull books out of the shelves , spill the ink .. . with Mr. Herndon spreading a tale of ill-mannered youngsters . When she and Abraham went to church and she was dressed in her beautiful gowns and bonnets trimmed with blonde and flowers , Tad would come into the sanctuary , his face sweaty , and stand in the aisle trying to persuade Abraham to come out and play ball with him . One Sunday morning when Mary insisted that the five Lincolns go to church together , Tad acted up in the middle of the sermon and his father had to sling him across his left arm like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiwie , hittin ' hood a pie , " Tad cried out as Abrahamstarted to carry him down the aisle . ( " Keep your eye on Willie , sitting good as pie . " ) Mary 's face flamed . When she got home she said sternly : " Thomas , I am going to have to punish you . " " Pwea hon ' haw me Hawma , Mamaday , " Tad pleaded , for not since his christening had anyone called him by his proper name . " Hat he mob huniment I know . I hit in hur hood a pie , if owney you haw me Had . " " If you do n't want me to call you Thomas , and it 's the most punishmentyou know , " translated Mary , " then you jolly well better sit in church good as pie ! " She did not have the heart to punish him . Nor could she draw comfort from her only woman confidante , for Hannah Shearer 's husband had come down with tuberculosis , and Hannahhad taken him back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Eliza Francis called to say goodbye , her face folded in layers of despondency . She and Simeon were going out to Portland , Oregon , not as pioneers or seekers after a new life ,  |p300but  as though to Bogota : the farmers ' newspaper which Simeon had started after selling the Journal had not been successful ; it seemed to Eliza that everything had turned to dust , that they had come to this late stage in their lives having accomplished nothing . To Mary they appeared sad and old and beaten ; but had the Lincolns been more successful than the Simeon Francises ? She knew how important it was , when Abraham was discouraged , to make a show of good cheer for her husband , but to her chagrin her nerves blew up in her face and then she was guilty of an outburst of temper against whoever might be present . She scolded Abraham for riding on the railroad cars with one elbow sticking out of his coat , for returning with his finely tucked shirt bosoms crumpled into hard balls in a corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his flapping carpet slippers and single gallus when he wanted to borrow something from the Gourleys or the Graves family . When she asked him to shovel the snow from the walks and came across him an hour later sunk in a chair before the fireplace studying a German grammar , she cried : " Abraham , you are of no account when you are home . You never do anything but warm yourself and read . " He looked up with an absent expression . " Mary , here is a curious thing , the Germans have no word for thimble , they call it a finger hat ; they have no word for glove , they call it a hand shoe . " " Do they have a word for house chores ? " They sold their cow because Abraham would not take care of her ; each day she had to send William or Tad with a bucket to find some milk .. . and a half hour later send Abraham to find his son . One afternoon , when she was dressing to receive the vice-presidents of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Make yourselves to home , ladies , Mrs. Lincoln will be down just as soon as she gets her trotting harness on . " She thought this bit of social manners as shocking as his dishabille . When she grew angry at him he would lower his head like a lamb into the storm , and leave the room . With the hiatus from politics the period of understanding between them , the unity of purpose , of a good team working together , ground to a halt . She was caught in outbursts over which she had no control . She hired fifteen-year-old Philip Dingley to keep the firebox filled , the walks clear of snow , the buggy greased ; but when she caught him sprawled in a chair in Robert 's room puffing amateurishly on a pipe she dumped his belongingsout of the second-story window into the street . She learned of a new shipment of organdies , went quickly to the store to select six choice patterns , then was furious when she found that the proprietor 's wife hadp301already made the best selection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the boys got some lime in his mouth , she rushed out screaming for help instead of merely rinsing the child 's mouth ; when some fat caught fire in a frying pan , she cried , " Fire , Fire ! " The Reverend Miner 's wife removed the pan and plunged it into a basin of water . She was hiring and firing so rapidly that she could scarcely remember the faces . When she went down to her cellar storage room and found it permeated with a sour smell because of an unwashed mop left standing there , she discharged the maid , then commented tightly : " If Mr. Lincoln should happen to die , his spirit will never find me living outside the boundaries of a slave state . " She was sitting slumped on a hard kitchen chair before the unlighted fire , feeling immeasurably sorry for herself , when she heard a knocking on the hack door . She opened it to find a dark-haired , dark-skinned young girl standing there . She recognized her as Frances Affonsa , the Portuguesegirl who worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Mrs. Lincoln , who was poorly . " Eu sou urea boa lavadeira , " Frances said . " I wash clothes , Mrs. Lincum . Frances was a determined worker , boiling the big tubs of water , scrubbingthe sheets , rinsing at the outside cistern . She did a slow but relentlessjob of the ironing . At the end of the day Frances stood triumphant by the piles of pressed shirts and linens , her face agleam . Mary said : " Frances , they say in Springfield that I am a hard woman to please . I 've had lots of girls come to work for me , but they do n't stay long . " " Se o trabalho for bem f eito , Mrs. Lincum nao e dificil ? If work good , Mrs. Lincum is not difficult ? " " No , Frances , but why is it that you do n't hate the job , and me , and the fact that you have to be here instead of somewhere else ? " Frances puzzled over this for a time . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , you content . Sunday I free . . . you like I come , make house clean ? " The next morning she received a letter from Harvard saying that if they would send Robert to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire for a year of special training , the boy could likely pass his university entranceexaminations . She would discuss it with Abraham at dinner , and write to Exeter Academy that very day . Sunday was Easter ; out of her bedroom window when she awakened , the sky was bright . Her niece , Julia Baker , married to one of the men who had bought the Journal , was having a christening for her baby at the church . She smelled coffee : Frances Affonsa was already in the kitchen working . Abraham came into her bedroom cleanly shaved , his eves crinklingin a little smile.  | " Come to the front window of my room , Mary . " She followed him through the two bedrooms ; in front of their house stood a shiny black carriage covered by a black leather top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shafts . She gazed up at him in bewilderment . " An Easter present for you , Puss . I knew you wanted to go to church for the Baker baby 's christening , and so I decided to take you there in style . " He also had bought a new kind of shirt which apparently had reached Springfield only in the past weeks , with a soft rolling collar attached to the shirt itself . He had a wide black silk tie to go with it . " You look like a new man , " she exclaimed . " You need a new man . I started playing handball again yesterday too : we 've made a new ball alley next to the Journal office : the end of it is the solid wall of a three-story building , so we had the ground leveled and a high board fence put up along Sixth Street . I won three games at a dime apiece and used my ill-gotten gain to buy the horse . and buggy and these new shirts . " His high spirits were infectious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned the embrace . They stood looking at each other , humor playing about their features , the sunlight dazzling on the windowpane . She woke the three boys , piloted them through warm baths : Frances served breakfast in the dining room , where she had set the table with Mary 's best silver and dishware . William observed : " One of us must be getting christened . " The younger boys were enchanted with the new carriage ; Robert wanted to know why they got it just as he was about to leave for Exeter . After services they went to Elizabeth 's and Ninian 's home for the reception and dinner . At midafternoon , after they had visited with the family , Abraham whispered : " Mary , I 've told Robert to walk the boys home when they 're ready . Let 's go for a ride over the prairies . " It was a beautiful afternoon . The rain of the past few weeks had brought out the wild strawberries and tall grasses , brilliant flowering weeds rippling in the wind . Abraham fastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they sat filled with happiness for themselves and love for each other : or were they one and the , same ? Abraham began to talk . His voice was clear and resonant . He was going to buy a German-language newspaper , the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger , in order that he might have a steady voice among the large German populationof Illinois ; in two weeks he would be going up to Bloomington where the Illinois Central Republican Committee convention was meeting ; he had decided to write the autobiography that Jesse Fell wanted to publish ;  |p303he  was going to write a letter to Salmon P. Chase , head of the Republican party in Ohio , urging that the Ohio Republicans not adopt their proposedplank : " To repeal the atrocious fugitive slave law , " on the grounds that such a plank would explode the convention . He did not say in actual words , I am going after the presidency , yet he made it clear to her that he was resolved to work for the nomination in a constructive fashion : he would try to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid errors of strategy which would alienate blocks of the voters ; in particular it was his hope that the Illinois delegation , which would have some twenty votes in the national convention , would not only nominate him but stand steadfastly by . She plunged into the job of getting Robert ready for Exeter , sewing for him a dozen fine linen shirts , having him fitted for broadcloth suits and formal dinner clothes . She gave a dinner party at the beginning of June because Abraham wanted to entertain a number of colleagues who had been helpful to him during the ' 58 campaign . A few days later she began a series of teas for the Republican ladies of the town . Jesse Fell had said Abraham would make a formidable candidate for the presidency , if not a successful one . Such as it was , this was her vineyard . Season after season there was work to he done . BY , the middle of June the strawberries came ripe , with **31;8100;TOOLONG every night . Toward the end of the month Mary gave a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people of the town to a farewell dinner for Robert and a friend who was leavingwith him for Exeter . The next time Abraham had to make a quick trip to Chicago , Mary suggested he take William with him . In a few days William wrote to afriend : This town is a very beautiful place . Me and father went to two theatres the other night . Me and father have a nice little room to ourselves . We have two little pitcher on a washstand . The smallest one for me the largest one for father . We have two little towels on a top of both pitchers . The smallest one for me , the largest one for father . We have two little beds in the room . The smallest one for me , the largest one for father . We have two little wash basin . The smallest one for me , the largest one for father . The weather is very very fine here in this town . . .  |p304Tad  was hilarious over the letter , making Mary read it to him until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited , along with the Logans , the Dubois ' and other state officials , to ride the full length of the Illinois Central lines in a private car such as Senator and Mrs. Douglas had had during the campaign , reviewing and assessing the property holdings of the railroad . July 14 , the day they left , was the hottest of the summer ; they were bundled down with carpetbags , bandboxes and baskets . Each day they covered the distance between towns , at night they put up at a hotel ; sometimes the beds were hard and the food bad , but Mary was fascinated by the changing scenes , endearing herself to the railroad officials when she told them she thought " railroad riding the most delightful thing in the world . " After their return Abraham kept the political pot boiling with letters to Republican leaders of other states , suggesting , " In every locality we should look beyond our noses and at least say nothing on points where it is probable we shall disagree . The great problem is to consolidate the conflictingelements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enmity and factionalism is bad . " But neither was their friend Douglas idle : he had just completed a fiery tour through Ohio , and the leading Republicans of that state urged Abrahamto come and answer him in Cincinnati , Dayton , Columbus . Ohio was a critical state ; if it went Democratic in the local election of 1859 there would be little chance for a Republican regime to be elected in 1860 . Abraham did not want to go into a neighboring state . " People always resent it , it causes defeat . " " But that is n't true in this case , Abraham , " she argued . " They expresslyinvited you . Ohio is an eastern state ; is n't it a good omen if they turn to the west and ask a Sucker to be the spokesman for their party ? " She paused . " Besides , now that you took Willie to Chicago , we 've got to take Tad with us on a trip . The boy is fairly bursting to live in a hotel room with two little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once again they were railroad riding . A friend in Columbus showed them the capital , then took them out to the Franklin County Fair . They returned to the hotel for dinner and at two o'clock Abraham made his speech from the east terrace of the state house . He drew laughter at the beginning by saying , " The Giant himself has been here recently , " and a loud cheer by asking , " Now what is Douglas 's popular sovereignty ? It is , as a principle , no other than that if one man chooses to make a slave of another man , neither that other man nor anybody else has a right to object . " The next day he spoke between trains at Dayton , and when they ar/rived at the station in Cincinnati there was a group of enthusiasts in carriagesto escort them to the Burnet House . Mary had a fighting sparkle in her eye ; it was in Cincinnati that Abraham had been so ignominiously ignored in the reaper case . They had tea in their own parlor , then Abrahamwent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Street Market Place to address an assemblage that seemed to consist of the whole city and the surrounding population for a hundred miles . At eleven the next morning there was a knock on their door . Gibson Harris came in . He now had a wife and a thriving law practice in Cincinnati , but to Mary he still seemed the charming young boy who some thirteen years before had brought her an envelope of money from Abraham'soffice . They fell to talking about the 186o campaign . Gibson said : " It looks like my father may have been a proper prophet after all . Remember , he said we would have to fight a civil war to keep the Union in existence . We 're getting closer to that war all the time , do n't you think , Mr. Lincoln ? " Mary studied Abraham 's face . If he were nominated and elected , would that be the signal for secession and bloodshed ? If Stephen Douglas were elected , would that mean no disunion , no fighting on battlefields ? Was that the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were he alive ? She waited tensely for Abraham to answer . He was a long time in formulating his thoughts , and then his voice was so quiet it seemed as though he were talking to himself . " Many who are for the Union greatly fear the success of the Republicanswould destroy the Union . Why ? Do the Republicans declare against the Union ? Nothing like it . The south says that if the Black Republicanselect a president they wo n't stand it , they will break up the Union . That will be their act , not ours . To justify it they must show that our policy gives them cause for such desperate action . Can they do that ? When they attempt it they will find that our policy is exactly the policy of the men who made the Union . Do they really think they are justified to break up the government ? If they do they are very unreasonable ; and more reasonable men can not and will not submit to them . If constitutionallywe elect a president , and therefore they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to deal with them . We hope and believe that in no section will a majority so act as to render extreme measures neces-sary . " The breath came out of her all at once . When Abraham made his decision to work for the nomination it had been predicated on the convictionof a reasonable man that a legal election would not result in an illegal revolt . She had the deepest respect for his judgment . She would remain serene.  |p306Norman  B. Judd , who had managed Abraham 's campaign in ' 58 , was on his way to New York to attend a meeting of the Republican National Committee . He came to the Lincoln house to explain his strategy . " The real purpose of this meeting is to set the place and time for our convention , " he told them . " Abraham , when do you think is the best time ? " " It must certainly be after the Democrats ' Charleston fandango . " " Agreed . Seward , Chase , Cameron and the others who have the best chances will all be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll step up guilelessly and say , As Illinois has no candidate , why not come to neutral ground and hold the convention in Chicago ? ' " The next morning a letter arrived from Iowa which read : " Part of the Iowa delegation will support you for president if you are a candidate , and all of us will support you for the vice-presidency . " " Looks like I may have to be elected vice-president to get into the Senate , " Abraham commented . " You 're not equipped by temperament to sit up on the dais making parliamentarian decisions , with no voice , " replied Mary . " But what a wonderful chance to bang with my gavel and say , Senator Douglas , you and your squatter sovereignty are out of order . ' " Her eyes flashed fire . " The only way you can silence Stephen Douglas is to defeat him . If you ca n't have the first place , you sha n't have the second ! " They continued their travels , Abraham taking her to St. Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousins while he went to Kansas , reaching there the day John Brown was executed in Virginia by the government for his raid on Harper 's Ferry , in which some seventeen of his own men had been killed in what the south had interpreted as an abolitionistslave uprising . Kansas ' political nerves were on edge ; it was Abraham'stask to convince them that the Republicans were not abolitionists , that they did not approve of John Brown 's acts of violence . While she enjoyed a delightful week in the home of Judge John C. Richardson , Abraham made his way across the raw and icy prairies in open buggies. speaking to a handful of people in hotel dining rooms . When they returned to Springfield Abraham settled in front of the ing-room fire , which he kept blazing hot in an effort to forget the cold of Kansas , and set down the autobiography which their friend had asked for a full year before . She was disappointed when he handed her the slim manuscript . " There seems so little of it , Abraham . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason I suppose that there i not much of me . If anything is to be made out of it I want it to be modest . "  | " I know modesty is considered a virtue . . . but could n't you puff yourself up just the tiniest bit ? " She rose early on New Year 's , for she was receiving ; as she went into the parlor to fill the silver containers with candies , almonds , Brazil nuts and filberts , she looked out the window and saw Abraham walking up and down the plank walk which connected their house with the Smiths ' , the Smith baby on his left shoulder , composing the speech he had been invited to give at Henry Ward Beecher 's famous church in Brooklyn , New York , in February . As she walked into the kitchen to supervise the making of the traditionalescalloped oysters , there was a jangling of the doorbell . She went to the door to find her cousin Logan wrapped in a huge formless overcoat , his white hair standing up as though frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he commented , " that means he 's working on his New York speech . " " I hope he finishes soon : Mrs. Smith is beginning to worry about whether the baby should be kept out so long in the cold air . " " Mary , I 'm not able to talk to Abraham about Billy Herndon ; I do n't like the man any more than you do . But someone 's got to stop him . Abraham'sthe only one who can do it . " She stared at her cousin . " Stop him from what , Cousin Logan ? " " From creating a rupture between Norman Judd and Abraham . He 's making the charge that Judd played Abraham false last year , that because he also led the movement that elected Trumbull , he presidency , and will emerge from the convention with Trumbull controlling the delegation . " " But Mr. Judd has gone off to New York to try to get the convention for Illinois so that Abraham will have local backing . Why is Mr. Herndondoing this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Jealousy . He thinks he should be Abraham 's campaign manager . He has already caused considerable ill feeling between Republicanshere . " " That 's no way to start the new year , " she exclaimed . She seized upon Abraham the moment he came onto the back porch . He listened carefully to the charge , replying : " Judd did vote for Trumbull against me , and though I 've said a times that was no injustice to me , I can not change the fact and compelpeople to cease speaking of it . I have constantly labored to have all recollection of it dropped . " " While your charming partner is working equally hard in the **25;8133;TOOLONG THE OHIO &; MISSISSIPPI 'S special train Number Forty-seven was gradually entering a theatre of conflict became increasingly evident once it had departed from Cincinnati , which , after all , proved not to be the destination of Callahan &; Grogan 's contract workmen . Several cars jampackedwith raucous , blue-clad troops were added to Number Forty-seven at several towns of importance . For the most part these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various strategic points along the Ohio River and in southern Illinois . In Cincinnati Big Pig Callahan 's company had stared round-eyed from across the platform when a company of wounded , many of them legless or lacking arms , had descended from a hospital train . This visual testimony that a war was actually in progress made a deep impression upon Matthew Everett while Paul Dent , who had shared his hardwood bench for two days and a night now , shivered , fell silent , then bit his lip and looked aside . At almost every railway station groups of plump , plain and painfully cheerful women appeared , to present baskets of pies , doughnuts or equally indigestible provender . What the weary and unwashed travellers really relished was the coffee they produced . Invariably it was full of cream and sugar and wonderfully rich , strong and fragrant . On practically every siding along the Ohio &; Mississippi 's track stood flatcars transporting forage wagons , caissons , gun limbers and an occasionalambulance or two . Just outside of Pittsburgh the Westbound Special had passed car after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy ordnance which some wiseacre declared to be naval guns fresh from the forges and rolling mills that , night and day , glowed in and around Pittsburgh . As Number Forty-seven rolled on and on fewer towns were to be seen along the right-of-way ; lonely-looking farmhouses stood amid fields appearingincredibly huge and flat to a New Englander 's eyes . Throughout western Pennsylvania and in Ohio it was unmistakable that the primeval forest which once had covered this region was still in the process of being cleared away for mile after mile of sere cornstalks fluttered and canted wearily between fire-blackened stumps . Here and there great numbers of felled trees were being burnt . The further west the train progressed the rougher-dressed did peoplep102on various platforms appear . Most of the men wore square-toed , kneehighboots tucked into frieze or homespun trousers ; peaked caps and flannelshirts under short-skirted coats of heavy wool or buffalo skin . Out here hoop skirts were a rarity and , almost without exception , the older women appeared to be gaunt , strong and weather-beaten . Of these Paul Dent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always kept by him . " We ought to reach Odin Junction pretty soon if we do n't get sidetrackedfor another troop train . " The Yale man had produced a large , nickel-plated watch . During the last few hours several supply trains which had the right-of-way had caused Number Forty-seven to be shunted onto sidings while the passengers cursed and shivered in this unusually bitter winter of 1861-6z . Matt inspected his gray-tinted hands and was ready to swear he could not have bathed or shaved in months . When the heat went on , his shirt and long woollen underwear gave off a sour effluvium ; and again felt stiff and clammy when the penetrating cold invaded this decrepit old coach . Dent was stating , " I 'll work out my three months ' contract in whatever shipyard I 'm assigned to and there do my best over a drawing board in some engineering office . " " And then ? " Matt demanded while shuffling and reshuffling a deck of cards upon a length of pine board fetched from a passing freight . ( " Dealingsharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned him during a hurried meal en route . " You 've got to limber them fingers till they handle the pasteboards real delicate-like . A clumsy gamblergen'rally comes to a bad end . " ) " I shall attempt to enlist in the naval forces I hear are being recruited at Cairo . " " You are going to go back into the fighting ? " " Oh , no , I would n't dare , even if I used a false name . As an engineer . . . " " You miss my meaning , " Matt said without looking up and still frowningat the greasy cards flying between his fingers . " Why do you want to get yourself wounded or killed ? Even an engineer takes that risk . You know what it 's like in battle and you 've noticed those pale-faced cripples limping around the railway stations . " From their corners Dent 's steady blue eyes considered his stalwart companion . " This war , does n't it mean anything to you ? " " Nothing , " Matt grunted . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of it , and to get ahead . What other course is open to a nameless bastard ? "  |p103The  slighter figure turned to face his companion , grit-streaked features gentle with understanding . " Once in New Haven I heard a famous ministerdeclare that no child is ever illegitimate  --  only its parents . ' Matt flared right up . " My mother was n't illegitimate ! " " I did n't mean that the way it sounded , " Dent apologized softly . " I only meant that the stigma should not be placed upon the result of an unlawful union , but rather upon one or both of those responsible for it . " Up ahead the locomotive 's bell commenced to clang for a crossroads . Because there had been a new fall of snow , the train 's wheels , muffled thereby , clicked softly , almost harmoniously , on and on . " What else can one do ? " Dent presently inquired and his voice gathered in strength and depth . " Why not dedicate yourself to preserving that Union our forefathers created and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of freedom upon those less fortunate than ourselves ? " Bitterly Matt shook his tangled yellow head and stared out over a seeminglyendless snow-covered plain . " And who could be less fortunate than an illegitimate child ? " " What about the slaves ? Hardly any of them are born in wedlock . " " My God , you 're not an Abolitionist , are you ? " jeered Matt and , rufflinghis cards , noted with satisfaction that they now fell into place evenly and swiftly . " You talk like a preacher  --  funny , is n't it ? Until last week I was going to study for the ministry . " " I was n't preaching , " Dent objected , flushing . " To begin with I was no Abolitionist . I answered the President 's call for volunteers simply to help preserve the Union , but after what I heard and saw down in Marylandand Virginia  --  and slaves are supposed to be extra-well treated there  --  I became one . " A big mechanic across the aisle caught the word " Abolitionist " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Them black bastards ai n't nothing but dirty competition for free labor . If I had my way every jigaboo in Amurica'dget kilt or shipped back to Africa . " " That 's right ! " half a dozen voices called . " On with the Union and to hell with the damn ' niggers . " Just then Big Pig Callahan 's burly form entered the car . He was waving a pink telegram obviously picked up at the last stop . " Shut up , bhoys , stow that goddam ' gabbin ' an ' listen to me , or shall I be knockin ' yer skulls together some more ? " He swayed at the end of the aisle in sunlight reflected off a snowfield , his pug nose glowing fiery red and his small eyes agleam . " I 've just received fresh orders from the War Department . " Everyone fell silent and those workmen who had been dozing sat up andp104knuckled their eyes . " When we reach Odin Junction this here company will be divided in two . " " Eh , what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When we get to Odin , two-thirds o ' this company will change train for Cairo , which is somewheres down in Illinois ; the rest will go on to St. Louie . Now listen well  --  and when yer monicker 's called , stand up and holler Here ' ! Now these men is for Cairo . " Over the soft clatter of wheels the big labor contractor bawled out name after name . " Paul Dent , " was the only one that meant anything to Matt . Presently Callahan came to the end of his list . " Thim 's what is left will go to St. Louie with Mr. Grogan and mind yez do n't go straying off at Odin Junction  --  the Provost Marshal there is meaner'n a singed wildcat . " From a seat down the car Philo Daingerfield , whose name had not been called , twisted about in his seat , grinned and tipped Matt an elaboratewink . " Callahan proposes but the War Department disposes , " observed Dent and commenced securing a very frayed carpetbag . " I assume the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What makes you think so ? " Matt inquired . " Why , in Pittsburgh I heard that while most of the gunboats have been , and are being constructed , in St. Louis a majority of them have been sent down to Cairo and Mound City to receive crews and armament . Cairo 's been made a Naval Station , you know . It 's the most important in the West . " He fell silent when the locomotive 's hysterical whistling indicated that Odin Junction must be near at hand . Matt put down the section of plank and restored Daingerfield 's deck of cards to his pocket . " And what do you intend to do , Matt ? Will you really work at the Eads shipyards ? " The New Englander nodded . " For a while I expect I 'll have to , but the first minute I can , I mean to buy up my contract . I hear there are pots of money in Government supply contracts , especially if you meet the right people and pay ' em enough . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Hell , no . I 'm no such a fool . " Dent hesitated , then pitched a stick he had been whittling into the car 's nearly empty fuel box . " So say you now . However , I wonder  --  " " You wonder what ? " " Matt , inside you 're too decent to dodge your duty  --  to take up swindlingthe Government . " Stubborn lines appeared upon the New Englander 's unshaven countenanceand he shook his head . " True , you have suffered unjustly and terribly but , nonetheless , youp105do have a man 's murder on your conscience . Do n't you feel that unselfish service on your part might go far to  --  " " Shut up ! " snarled Matt . " Who are you , a goddamn ' coward and a deserter , to preach to me ? " Dent winced , stiffened , then rose to his feet swaying because brakes were being too hurriedly applied . " Whatever my mistakes have been , " said the man from Connecticut in a low and quivering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Goodbye , Matt , I wish you a swift change of heart . " Now the train was rattling past a series of snow-shrouded flatcars most of them bearing well-tarpaulined parts of steamboat engines , engines designed to propel fast river transports or those slow but deadly gunboats which John Rodgers , Samuel Pook and James B. Eads were producing in such a tearing hurry . A brakeman in red wool stocking cap thrust his head in from the platform . " Odin ! Odin Junction ! Change trains for Centralia , Mound City and Cairo ! " FROM THE BLUFF on which was located the western terminus of the Ohio &; Mississippi Railroad one could make out the dark loom of St. Louis across the Mississippi but none too clearly on a day like this . Snow squalls were chasing each other like playful puppies across this great , coffee-colored and floe-dotted river separating Illinois from Missouri . " This wind sure must have been honed on the North Pole , " Philo Daingerfield commented through chattering teeth and bent his frail figure against the wind . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt shook his head . He was enjoying the icy blasts after the fetid atmosphere in the steam cars . Besides , it reminded him of home , althoughhere there were no evergreens , no hills or mountains , only flat snowy expanses of farmland back of rowdy , busy little Illinoistown . " You go if you want to . Back in Maine we never see anything like this . " Although the wind whipped at his shabby jacket with its greasy rabbitskincollar , Daingerfield lingered , pointed at the four-mile-long line St. Louis sketched along the opposite shore . " Look at all them steamboats tied up account o ' the war  --  must be near a hundred of ' ern . She 's quite a town , ai n't she ? The St. Louie Directory claims there 's above 170,000 people of all conditions livin ' over yonder . "  | " Ever been there ? " " Nope , most o ' my piloting 's been done from Pittsburgh to Paducah . I know the Ohio like the working end o ' a demijohn . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " He tucked hands under armpits to warm them and directed eyes , rendered teary by the gale , back to the city . " They 're prosperous and none too smart , except the Dutch-men . " " Dutchmen ? " " Yep . St. Louie crawls with what they call Dutchmen ' who ai n't Dutch at all but Germans , really . Heard tell they can drill and sing to beat the band . Iffen we like it yonder we 'll visit their Turn Club sometime . Make damn ' good soldiers but they 're hard and cruel , so they say , and the rest o ' St. Louie 's scared stiff they 'll get massacred some fine day . " Matt offered no comment , only studied the sprawling metropolis and suffered a presentiment that somehow St. Louis would figure large in the course of his career . His blue serge overcoat was proving quite as capable of foiling this damp and icy wind as it was in Maine . As Philo had said , the inevitable twin funnels , stacks or chimneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river craft of all sorts , tied up to the levee and to wharfs and slips , suggested a forest of long-dead trees fringing the river . The larger steamboats , he perceived , predominately were sidewheelers , some of them much bigger than the coasters which ran from Bangor to Portland and Boston . Most of the lesser craft looked to be sternwheelers . These , so Philo explained , were used on small and shallow tributary rivers such as the Osage , the Kansas and the Illinois . The rest were freighters , tugs , snag boats and the like . " Yes , Matt , they claim St. Louie 's a live , wide-open town . Over there 's as many gambling saloons , theatres and whorehouses as you 'll come across outside o ' N'Orleans . It 's a rich town , too , or was , till the fighting broke out last summer . Right now , St. Louie is Gen'ral Henry Halleck 's headquarters . He commands the whole Western Department . Now will you for God 's sake come into the lee o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave for a half hour yet and I 'm colder'n a well-digger 's eye teeth . You can look at St. Louie any time . " Matt started to follow his companion but checked himself because when the snow let up it seemed that some special occasion was being celebrated on the far bank . It looked as if some vessel were about to sail . From this distance one could n't be sure whether or not there were bodies of troops drawn up on a long wharf , but certainly flags were fluttering above it . Presently he watched spurts of steam break from above the pilothouse of several big steamers but heard no whistles.  |p107An  individual in a long-skirted black overcoat sporting a collar of marten pelts and a shako-like cap of the same lustrous fur came tramping up , florid features set in a friendly grin . Said he in a hearty manner , " Heyo , boys . I see you 're strangers and no doubt wondering what all the ruckus across the river is about . " Promptly Philo offered a slim and long-unwashed hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This fellow must be rolling in money . " " Well , that there boat 's the Essex , " said he . " Another of them ironcladsJim Eads has been buildin ' for Uncle Abe . She 's bigger than the first ones he built last fall , " he added . " The Benton will be bigger still . " The stranger noted Matt 's interested expression . " Yep , Jim Eads ' been doing one mighty fine job . Built four gunboats under contract in just forty-five days and couple of ' em was launched with their engines alreadyseated . Three others were constructed down to Mound City over in Illinois . " A booming of cannon sounded when , across the river , an ungainly vesselgradually pulled away from its slip with torrents of sooty smoke pouringfrom twin funnels . The stranger beamed but his small , bright blue eyes were hard as agates as he observed , " Reckon you two boys must be contract shipbuildersfrom the East ? " " Ye 're sharp as a new Barlow knife , friend , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How 's business these days in St. Louie ? " " Fine , fine , " boomed the well-dressed stranger , " but not so brash since the President replaced that gold-spangled , wind-bag called John C. Fremont . Halleck 's clamped down in jigtime . " The speaker hesitated and , shiny red features a-glow , inquired hopefully , " Say , you boys do n't happen to be contractors ? " Matt started to say " No , " but Philo clutching wildly at his battered stovepipe under a sudden gust off the Mississippi , said diffidently , " Now , that 's as may be . Why ? " The stranger treated him to a sidewise glance . " Iffen you could coax a trade permit out o ' Halleck 's Quartermaster I know where I can lay hands on plenty of second-grade wheat and corn  --  cheap , real cheap , enough to make a smart feller a hundred and fifty percent on the Governmentpurchase price  --  more from , well , never mind where . " Matt followed the others back towards the siding where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering to straggle down to the ferry slip . " Why ask us ? " was Matt 's natural query . " Why offer to share such a profit with strangers ? "  | " I got my permit cancelled . It was one Major McKinstry wrote for me and I had to grant him a fifteen percent share . " The stranger halted beside a pontoon carrier and lingered there stampinghis feet , sparse red chin whiskers tossing in the breeze . " Since you 're new from the East , " said he briskly , " maybe I , or my friend Greenway , could help you land a contract , ca n't myself ; Old Brains '  --  that 's what they call Halleck  --  wo n't let any of his quartermastershave nawthin ' to do with any of Fremont 's contractors . See how it is ? " " Reckon I do . " Philo grinned . " Permit me , sir , to offer my card . " He produced another of those grimy pasteboards such as he had showed to Matt . The other squinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Um . So yer a river pilot , among other things ? Sounds interesting , ' specially you bein ' a engineer and such . " " What 's your name , friend ? " Philo queried gently . " And where do you live ? " " Around St. Louie I 'm called Quirk . I live over there in the Virginia Hotel , but I hail from downriver , " he added . " How far down ? " " We 'll say Memphis . " Philo 's bright , bird-like little eyes intensified their interest . " You 've maybe still got a few friends down yonder ? " " Might and then I might n't , " the other evaded and produced an alligator-skinseegar case . " ' Tai n't healthy ' round here to own friends south of Cairo . " " You goin ' across on the ferry , Mr. Quirk ? " " I do n't aim to swim , " the other grunted . Matt glanced out over the great stream and noticed that several big floes had appeared from upstream , jagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross what with all that ice ? " " Oh , sure . Even drunk as he is right now Tom Bancroft can miss that much ice easy enough . " Straight out into midstream threshed the new gunboat Essex , sluggishlypropelled by a single paddlewheel , her vitals concealed under a casing of armor that gleamed gray-brown in the morning sunlight . Long streamers of sooty smoke were whirled instantly away from the new gunboat'stwin smokestacks set just abaft of what must be her wheelhouse . White puffs of steam from her exhaust pipes too , immediately were dissipated . The Essex 's armored sides , the New Englander noticed , were angled upwards and inwards from the water line at roughly forty degrees . From her stern streamed a big , brand-new National Flag.  |p109Presently  Matt made out the outlines of what must be gunports . " How many and what kind of guns might she mount ? " " She do n't carry none at all , right now , " replied Quirk pulling his martenskin cap lower over large , bat-like ears . " Likely they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe Mound City . " Never , Matt was thinking , could a more ungainly vessel have been designed . There was no trace of fluidity in her lines such as would characterize a seagoing ship ; she was all ugly , sharp angles and suggested nothing more than a gigantic bread pan mounted upside down on a pointed raft . Soon the current carried her downstream towards Cairo and the deadly Gray batteries lying in wait for her . A shout from the direction of the railhead drew their attention . A Mr. Dykes , a yellow-eyed and lantern-jawed individual who was the St. Louis agent for Messers . Callahan &; Grogan , was bellowing through cupped hands . " Get down to the water 's edge , boys ! Ferry leaves in ten min-utes . " Presently the little party of mechanics , carpenters and steamfitters were guided down a very steep and muddy street to a ferry slip at which lay a good-sized three-decked sternwheeler called the Pembina . She presented a weary and battered appearance . All about her were ranged mounds upon mounds of assorted supplies awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and BrigadierGeneralUlysses S. Grant 's slowly gathering forces . Once she started her trip cakes of ice threateningly bumped along her hull and the muddy , dirty yellow current tried savagely to swing the Pembina downstream . However , her sternwheel splashed and her exhaust pipes sputtered so mightily that her correct course to the western shore was resumed . The closer the ferry approached her destination the more numerous became the signs of war . On the levee above a great crenellated building , which was the Federal Arsenal , stood a big earthenwork fort and another on an island below it . The atmosphere prevailing in St. Louis , Matt quickly discerned , was totally different from what he had experienced thus far . The city existed under martial law and seemed well aware of it . Grimly , Quirk related that when someone had asked the Provost Marshal what martial law could do , Major McKinstry had replied , " Martial law can do pretty much as it damn well pleases . " Smiles were few and people moved as if in a hurry to transact their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarms of blue-clad troops under arms or off duty . Some of them were garbed in gay Militia uniforms or wore faded and antique Federal garmentsthat might have been regulation during the war with Mexico.  |p110Most  Western units wore no uniform at all except big black slouch hats and white cross-belts over checked shirts and homespun jackets . For the most part these Kansans and men from Nebraska were big , fiercelookingfellows wearing uncombed hair dangling down to their shoulders . Even the younger men boasted long , drooping mustaches or chin whiskers grown in ragged profusion . Everyone carried a Bowie knife or a pair of private pistols in addition to their Government-issued weapons . Although in ranks , they steadily chewed tobacco and were forever staining the dirty snow with their spittle . " Pick yer feet up , fellers , " pleaded an officer in a fringed hunting shirt . " We ai n't got much of a march down to the Arsenal . I 've a train waiting at the Iron Mountain deppo that 'll fetch you straight down to the shipyardsat Carondelet . " Matt was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing clutching a sheaf of yellow papers . " Come along , you Callahan and Grogan men . " " How far 's it to Carondelet ? " someone wanted to know . " Why , ' t is a lovely little village sityated at the southmost end o ' St. Louis , " Dykes evaded . " Now follow me and stay close ' cause if you figger to go strayin ' off , yer wrong . To move about this here city you 've got to have a pass signed by the Provo ' Marshal hisself . See ? Otherwise yell end up in Myrtle Street or Gratiot Street Jail or mebbe in some stinking guardhouse . " Coughing , spitting and cursing , but nonetheless happy to have reached their destination , the labor party moved off along Main Street , which paralleled the river between rows and rows of huge , empty and gloomylookingbrick warehouses . Tied up at the far end of these lay dozens upon dozens of river steamers immobilized for lack of freight and passengers . Most of these showed rust on slender chimney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect . Paint was peeling off ornatescrollwork , pilothouses and paddle-wheel housings which often were elaborately decorated with sunbursts , panoramas or patriotic devices . Snow had not even been cleaned off their decks or bulwarks so icicles hung in festoons from guards and railings . " By God , if that ai n't the old Green Mount ! " suddenly said one of the party . " Many 's the time I 've rid her ' twixt Cincinnati and Memphis . " A half hour 's train ride southward past the U.S. Arsenal which was the fountainhead of Union military strength in St. Louis , brought the one car special into the overcrowded and bustling village of Carondelet . Here loomed half a dozen long shiphouses . Easily a dozen ship 's ways dominatedthe landscape amid a small forest of cranes and hoists . Over thep111main gate leading to the shipyard was a weathered sign reading " James B. Eads Salvage and Construction Co . " Philo Daingerfield stretched his scrawny neck in peering this way and that at various shabby buildings and up various muddy streets , much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have we got to live and work in this godforsaken hole ? " grunted a lanky New Englander . " Ai n't nary a spruce or a fir in sight nowheres . " " Fer tonight you fellers will bunk at the Elkhorn House , " Dykes announced . " ' Tai n't no deeloox hotel and you 'll have company in bed I expect  --  six-legged , I mean . Haw ! Haw ! Yell find all kinds of boardin ' places , but do n't try puttin ' up at no whorehouse , " he cautioned seriously , " ' cause the Provoo 's men will put ye out and jail ye like as not . General Halleck do n't figger ye 've been brought near two thousand miles just to catch a dose o ' clap so 's you ca n't work . The War Department 's mighty impatient for this yer Benton to get finished . They must be big doin 's afoot below Cairo , else I miss my guess . " As THE SATURNINE Mr. Dykes had predicted , the Elkhorn House proved no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from many a fierce summer sun , its walls admitted cold air as freely as a sieve . Guests , the new arrivals from the East discovered , were expected to sleep three in a bed . There was exactly one water tap for each of the Elkhorn 's four floors and a visit to the privies entailed a Spartan expedition out back of the stables . In all public rooms the atmosphere was heavy with a persistent reek of stale sweat , tobacco juice and the odors of cabbage and various fried foods . Never a rug graced this hostelry 's gritty floors , and its crude furniture had been patched and mended so often that a good half of it had been stacked , quite useless , on a wide verandah . Contractors , armorers , steamfitters , draftsmen and a sprinkling of petty officers from some naval contingent comprised the bulk of the patronage . Whatever services were performed , and they were few and far between , were carried out by mournful , loose-jointed and very stupid Negro men . " We give up Kirin ' wenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a gold-toothed and pimply desk clerk informed Philo . " Yessir , could n't get no work out of ' em at all . They was spendin ' all their time in bed.  |p112When  a feller 's been campaignin ' a couple o ' months he ai n't choosey  --  even officers . " " Now ai n't that a pity ? " Philo suddenly cocked his narrow head to one side , a mannerism of his , and grinned . " Hell ! Do n't you fret none , brother , " the clerk reassured him . " You kin get all you want along Water Street . " Matt surveyed the Elkhorn 's grubby saloon . By now he knew that practically all the Pook and Isherwood-designed ironclads had been completedand long since had departed for Cairo . Only the gunboat Benton remained in Eads ' shipyard and she was so nearly complete it was obvious that Messers . Callahan &; Grogan would have done much better to have diverted their whole company to southern Illinois . He told Philo as much . " Well , Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer , " I been kind of inquiring around . ' Pears like them gunboats has been mostly finished , but the sitooation hereabouts ai n't half so poor as one might reckon . There 's a wad o ' money floating around loose . " A steamfitter who had travelled all the way from Bangor growled from across the lobby . " What ails this tomfool government in Washington ? I 'm mad clean through . Thought we 'd come ' way out here to build a parcel of gunboats to whip them damn ' pesky Rebels . " Philo tugged at his goatee and drawled , " Well , friend , you go get your hands blistered if you want . Me , I was ready and willin ' ; so was my friend Matt , here . But bein 's how we 've been sent out on a wild goose chase , what sense is there in settin ' round , sucking yer thumb and howlin ' like a hound dog at the full of the moon ? That right , Matt ? " Matt frowned , twirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had cost ten cents . " I would like to get in at least a lick of work on account of Callahan 's put up good money to fetch us out here . Somehow , I ca n't just sit around doing nothing so I 'm heading for the shipyard office tomorrow morning . " " Good idee , " Philo agreed a trifle too readily . " Once we get our contractsendorsed by Eads ' office we can draw passes from the Provoo and go take a look about St. Louie . " The winter of ' 61  --  ' 62 would remain memorable for years to come because of its frigid ferocity , so Matt and Philo had become blue-nosed and chilled through before they stood before a gaunt Indian-like sergeant wearing inverted scarlet chevrons on both dark blue sleeves . He never even looked up at these new applicants , only selected two squares of printed pink cardboard . " You , the big man , name ? Age ? Color of eyes ? Where from ? "  | " Matthew Everett , twenty-one years , dark brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uh . A real Yankee , eh ? " " Yes . I guess so . " " Abolitionist ? " " No . " " That 's good . No use freeing the niggers , they 'll become a public charge . Where you living hereabouts ? " " We do n't know yet , " put in Philo , " but , by God , we ai n't staying at that Elkhorn rat-trap . " The sergeant 's enormous black mustaches lifted as he stamped and shoved forward the passes . " Fill that in when you find a place . Take it to Lootenant Snell for endorsement , he 's second door down the hall , iffen he ai n't already hauled out to supper . If he 's gone you 'll have to come back ' round eight . Pass ai n't no good ' thout his signatoor . " Fortunately Lieutenant Snell was still on duty . He proved to be a large , plump individual wearing a single-breasted tunic at least a size too small . He actually glanced up before scrawling his signature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You got kinfolk in Massa- Ochusetts ? " " No , " Matt replied stonily . " I 've no kinfolk  --  anywhere . " " Too bad , " Lieutenant Snell said , his pen scratching over the card- board . " I 'm from Springfield and my Aunt Hephzibah ' bides near Lowell  --  thought you might know her . " He straightened , surveyed the tall , broad-shouldered figure before him with disconcerting attention . " Mister , by what 's written across this pass , " said he , " you 're a New Englander , so I 'll offer you a word of advice . Never forget that out here the people are savages , damn ' crude , treacherous and bloodthirsty savages , and that includes Missourians , Kansans , Kentuckians and those triple-dyed bastardsdown in Arkansas . If you trust ' em so far as you can throw a bull by the tail you 'll rue it . Is n't a one but what will sell his sister to a halfbreed , provided he gets his price . " Back in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . It was composed mostly of one- or two-storey shacks of which about every third one was either a saloon or a sporting house . Although true darkness had not yet defeated a yellow afterglow in the west , the tinkle of ill-tuned pianos , shouts and songs already began to resound . " Well , " said Philo buttoning his short overcoat , " now that we 've got us our passes what say we go and look up this Greenway feller ? " " Who in hell 's Greenway ? " " That friend of Mr. Quirk's. "  | " Quirk  --  who 's he ? " " Who 's he ? " For the first time Philo Daingerfield sounded annoyed . " Look here , Matt , you damn ' well got to learn to remember names , ' specially when yer in a strange city . Quirk was that well-dressed feller we met on the bluff over in Illinoistown . You still got them three hundred greenbacks ? " " You did n't notice me lose any in that faro game last night ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small man slapped his companion on the back , had to reach up to do so . " You sure catch on quick for a feller that could n't call one card from the next a week ago . I 'm right proud of you , Matt , and thankful too . " Caution entered the big New Englander 's manner . " Why ? " " Well , on them steam cars I won above a hundred dollars . With what you got and I got , if we pool , we 've got enough to make a good beginning , if we handle it right . Let 's go find this Greenway feller . " " How 'll you locate him ? " " That 's easy . " Philo grinned . " Just you wait and see . " The oddly assorted pair pushed their way along a narrow , unpaved street bucking a throng of workmen many of whom had been paid off and were speculating on what they might do next now that the two gunboatsGeneral Fremont had ordered personally during his incumbency as Commander-in-Chief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guiding Light Bar a mechanic drawled , " Me , I 'm haulin ' right out o ' this sinkhole lessen old man Eads has got him a passel o ' new contracts . Water front 's dead as Kisley 's hen when she was stuffed with onions . Figger on headin ' fer Cincinnati or Youngstown ; hear tell they 're paying top wage at that ordnance works where they cast all them cannons fer the gunboats . " While sampling a glass of new , rank-tasting whiskey with Philo , Matt listened to the hum of conversation all about . Someone said , " I ai n't in such an infernal lather to clear out of Carondelet . Heard tell there 's to be another whole flotilla of gunboats to be built here come spring  --  bigger and heavier than them Forty-five-Day-Wonders we finished and sent off last month . " " Ah , the hell with that ! " grunted a steamfitter in a red-and-green checked flannel shirt . " Credit all the gossip you can hear and there 's to be a hundred ironclads and three hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By dint of weight and muscle Matt managed to pilot Philo into a corner of the teeming bar , a point of vantage from which they could view the changing panorama of clients . The bartender , a fat German ,  |p115bald  save for a crop of blond bristles rising rigidly from his pink and shiny scalp , drew near . " Vot vilt it be , poys ? Order up or move on ; customers iss vaiting . " " Two more o ' the same , " Philo ordered tossing a twenty-five-cent shinplasteron the sopping mahogany . ' By the way , friend , you ever hear o ' a feller named Greenway ? " " Phil Greenvay ? " the bartender checked himself in the act of tilting a dark green demijohn . " You iss freunds by him ? " " Sure , old friends , " the Kentuckian blandly asserted . " So ? " Swiftly the bartender recovered the two small glasses he had set out and replaced them with two larger ones . " On der house , " he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red-brown bourbon . " Mr. Greenvay iss out back , second room on der right , same as usual . " " Thanks , friend , " Philo said aloud , then hissed to his companion , in an undertone , " quick , slip me a four-bit shinplaster . " There you are , my friend , that 's just so 's you remember Daingerfield , Everett and Company next time we show up . " " Dank you , Mr. Everett . " " Oh , no , I 'm Daingerfield . This here is Mr. Matt Everett . " As Philo drew himself up his preposterous resemblance to Jefferson Davis became so pronounced that several people stared , put their heads together and whispered . " Dank you , Mr. Daingerfield . Best you go right now to talk mit Mr. Greenvay . Later on , ach ! he gets so busy . " They discovered Mr. Greenway smoking a huge seegar and leaning upon a scarred wooden table in what must once have been a private diningroom . The squalid bareness of this room was more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His enormously fat form was enclosed in a plum-colored claw-hammer coat , a waistcoat of vermilion velvet set off by a row of turquoise buttons leading down to pantaloons of a vivid blue striped in black . Across Mr. Greenway 's ample belly was draped a red-gold chain massive enough to anchor a towboat , as Daingerfield later commented . Further , he was clean-shaven , with a cherry-hued snub nose and slightly crossed eyes of the palest blue imaginable . About a heavily freckled scalp clung a woolly line of thin black locks . In the act of taking their leave was a singular pair of visitors . One was an obvious Hebrew with beady black eyes , a long black beard ending in a fork and sombre clothes that were neither clean nor well-cut . The other stood as tall as the Jew was short and had a long sallow face dominated by a hawk-like nose and high cheekbones , one of which was diagonallyp116traversed by a livid scar . He wore a big Bowie knife in a fringed sheath strapped to the front of a wide , brass-mounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These here gents are Mr. Rothstein and Mr. Callam , " boomed Mr. Greenway when the four men hesitated just inside the doorway . " They 're old friends of mine and now that I 've got ' em their trade permits I reckon they 'll do a land-office business . " Daingerfield bowed and made a flourish of his battered stovepipe hat that all but swept the floor . " Mr. Rothstein and Mr. Callam , " he said . " That 's right , " the Jew said quickly . " Pleased to meet you . Any friends of Mr. Greenway 's are friends of mine . " " But we 're not friends  --  yet , " Matt protested . " We 've never seen Mr. Greenway before now . This is Mr. Daingerfield and I 'm called Matt Everett . " " Tut , tut ! " came Greenway 's genial protest , " let 's say new friends . ' I can see we 're going to get along . I like honesty such as yours , sir , " and he fixed his convergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentlemen , come in and state your business . " The callers then underwent a swift but thorough appraisal that includedcopper-skinned Daingerfield in his shabby , flashy garments and Matt still in his travel-stained and wrinkled Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes from Dexter . " Grab a chair , gents , " invited the speculator . " Here , try these  --  " He produced a leather case of seegars , two of which Daingerfield selected with alacrity . " My friend do n't smoke . Well , Mr. Greenway , we 've just come in to St. Louie from the East  --  we 've contracted to work on them ironclads , but that was only to win free transportation to this glorious golden West . " " You ai n't the first to figger it that way , " Greenway commented sourly , restoring the seegar case to his pocket , " nor will you be the last . You two got any ready cash ? " " Some , " Matt admitted . He was sitting on the edge of a chair with a narrow-brimmed felt hat crushed between powerful hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maybe do a mite of business . " " Now , now ! " chuckled Greenway standing up to light his seegar at the lamp chimney . " You fellows ai n't answering at all . How much you got ? A thousand , maybe ? " " No , about half of that , " Matt said before Philo could stop him . The fat man 's interest waned considerably . " Urn , that ai n't much , and that 's a fact . " He blew a great smoke ring . " Still it might do ; depends on the kind of business you had in mind . "  | " Why  --  why , supplying the Government , " said Philo . " A friend of ours says there 's easy pelf to be made in that direction . " Mr. Greenway settled back on his armchair the cane bottom of which creaked under his weight , cocked his head to one side and surveyed his seegar . " And who might this friend be ? " " His name 's Quirk  --  " Interest suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't referring to Sam Quirk ? " " Why , to be sure . Sam 's an old friend of mine . " The big man heaved himself to his feet . " Daingerfield  --  if that 's really your name  --  I 'm thinking you 're not only a liar but a damn ' clumsy one . " " Sir , I resent your implication ! " Daingerfield 's jaw shot forward and his short body quivered with outrage but all the same his always supple hands hung curiously loose by his sides . " Mister , I 've killed a man for lesser insult . " " Have you ? " Greenway said , shiny features suddenly frozen into an evil smile and it seemed that a pair of nickel-plated derringers abruptly sprouted from his well-manicured hands to be held unwaveringly in line with the Kentuckian 's flat belly . " You are a liar , ai n't you ? " Completely aghast , Matt looked first at Daingerfield 's small taut figure , then at Greenway 's towering form . Philo blinked at the two menacing black circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't known Sam Quirk so long at that . " " You bet you ai n't , " rasped the man in the red waistcoat . " On account your friend here ' pears honest , I 'll tell you why I spotted you for a liar . Quirk 's given name ai n't Sam and never was , because it 's Simon . He 's my brother-in-law . Daingerfield , " he barked , " just you clear out of here . This gent and I are going to talk . " Philo Daingerfield drew himself up with an amazing semblance of dignity . " A gentleman , sir , never lingers where he is not wanted . Matt , I now depart to hunt us up some living quarters . Meet me at the hotel . " As the door closed upon the little Kentuckian , Greenway , chuckling , replaced his derringers in the lower pockets of that garish waistcoat . " Now , Mr. Everett , just what had you in mind ? " Only after swallowing a couple of times did Matt find his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollections flooding into his mind . " Well , sir , I aim to work for Mr. Eads just long enough to earn my freight but I see small sense in slaving over a lot of gunboats any longer than I have to . ' " Why not buy up yer contract from Big Pig Callahan ? " " Might be a good idea , " Matt admitted . " Will he sell ? " " Sure , if the price is right . "  | " I 'll talk to him . " " Now that 's real commendable , real honest , " Greenway 's fleshy fingers flexed themselves several times . " Me , I prefer dealing with honest men . " He winked . " Of course , there 's honest men and honest men , so give me a man who keeps his eye on the main chance but who plays fair . You got how much money of your own ? " Matt stood up , hat in hand , and said mournfully , " Only three hundred and eighteen dollars , so I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time . You would n't be interested in my little stake . " " Sit down , man , sit down , " boomed the contractor and waved his seegar in an expansive gesture . " You 're wrong , ' way wrong . Not a year ago , Mr.  --  what did you say 's your name ? " " Everett . " " Mr. Everett , I crossed from over in Illinois bringing nawthin ' more than a carving knife , hickory shirt , a pair of galluses , homespun pants and the boots I stood up in . Right now , " he patted the great watch chain and his diamond-studded shirt front , " I reckon I must be worth a couple hundredthousand dollars , more or less , every cent of which was honest earned through the sale of goods under boney fide Government contracts , signed , sealed and delivered by Gen'l Fremont 's Quartermaster . No , sir . No one ca n't ever rightly claim Tobias Greenway 's commerce is crooked or illegal . " He hunched over the table , small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll speak right out . If I help you get a permission to trade and mebbe a contractor two , it 'll not be just for love of them brown eyes of yours . I want ten percent of any profits you earn . " " Ten percent ! " Matt burst out . " Why , good God , up in Maine three percent  --  " " This ai n't Maine , " snapped Greenway , " and nowadays ai n't ordinary times . Would you rightly kick at paying me ten percent if you was to clear , well , something like thirty , mebbe forty thousand dollars inside the next three months ? " Matt fairly goggled . " Thirty-forty  --  thousand dollars ? That is n't pos-sible . " " It is . But only if you hold a permit to trade and contracts issued by Gen'ral Halleck 's Quartermaster . See ? Since all agreements signed by Fremont 's officers have been voided there are precious few permits valid these days . So them what has ' em can pile up the cash . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " Matt 's yellow head inclined decisively . " Let 's shake on it then , " grinned Greenway . " And I 'll see Callahan about buying your contract . I 'll even advance you money if you need it  --  at ten percent . May take a short while , though , so keep yer pants on . " " I will . When do I see you next ? " " Here , tomorrow evening , ' round six . Oh , one thing more , Mr. Everett . You 'd better get rid of the big-talking weasel who came in with you . He 'll queer a lot of deals for you . He 's got card-sharp , liar and cheat , written over him in letters a foot high . " Now , I 'll just take a hundred dollars on account . " Heart hammering wildly at the thought of parting with so much money , Matt counted out that sum onto the table . " Ninety , one hundred . Good . You 'll never regret this , " beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll go far . " To MATTHEW EVERETT 'S considerable surprise , Philo Daingerfield appearednot the least bit downcast or angry when he found that diminutive individual busily writing in that cheerless bedroom they shared . " I 'm sorry , " Matt began awkwardly , " I suppose really I should have gone out when you did . " " Hell , no , Matt . I was n't half so insulted by Mr. Greenway as I let on . " Reaching into his battered carpetbag the Kentuckian produced a pint bottle . " Here , take a pull of this bust-head , it 's still considerable cold and raw outside . " " Then you were n't really insulted ? " Matt could not conceal his amazement . " Hell , no ! Fact he paid me the high compliment of admitting that my wits were sharper than his . I only hope , " the little man observed while pouring water from a pitcher the lips of which someone had mended with lead , " that he did n't bamboozle you and get any cash away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had , Matt decided . He would remainmiserably uneasy until his next interview with Greenway . " While you were talking with Greenway I made some further acquaintances . They 'll prove useful , and it was useful learning Mr. Quirk 's first name is Simon . " Cheerfully he waved a grimy hand . " Yes , sir , that Greenwaycuss did us a real service when he gave out that fellow 's correct name . Drink up , Matt , and tomorrow night let 's move to better quarters . On the way over you can tell me about yer arrangement with Greenway , which , " sharply he eyed his towering , fresh-faced companion , " I judge you 've alreadyconcluded ? "  | " Yes . I have . " Philo angrily spat tobacco juice into a tin cuspidor . " Ye should have talked to me first , " he complained . " Bet he 's even charging you seven percent commission  --  " A groan escaped the New Englander . " No , ten . " " My God , what you need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for their room with local scrip which had grown incredibly limp and dirty for all that such currency had been in circulation less than a month . " Where are we headed ? " demanded Matt , shouldering his woods pack . " I hear there 's a tidy little hotel on Hickory Street and not far from the Iron Mountain Railroad Station and , " he winked , " close by the levee and water front . " " Why , that 's right in St. Louis itself . " " Sure is  --  we want to be right handy to the center of things , as we ai n't here in Carondelet . You see , we 'll meet some almighty keen competition in this contracting business  --  a lot of big fellers have been in it since the start of the war like Quirk , Rothstein , Gus Krausmaier , yer friend Greenwayand some others . Yep , we 'll have to look sharp and act real smart . " Early next evening after finishing his work at Eads ' boatyard , Matt sought out Tobias Greenway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satin and wearing a dark blue clawhammercoat over his enormous belly . " So you turned up ? " He waved an affable greeting . " Figured you would . " In response to a gesture , Matt seated himself , cap on lap , and carefullyeyed the gross figure behind the desk . " I make it a point to keep my word , " said he shortly . " Now what is it you wanted to tell me ? " " As I 've already told you , friend Everett , my license to trade with the Army was revoked by that Halleck bastard 's Quartermaster-in-Chief . Means that although I still can buy , " he winked ponderously , " and I know just where to find the hard-to-get merchandise  --  I ca n't nowise negotiate with the Army Purchasing Commission . So you , son , will have to carry on our dickering with Colonel Sherrod . " He stared fixedly at the New Englander . " Know how to drive a hard bargain ? " A faint grin curved Matt 's unshaven mouth . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't a born trader . A man does n't amount to much up our way unless he can drive a bargain sharper than a woodsman 's ax . We take real pleasure in trading or swapping . " Phoebe 's pa was famous for his skill in such matters . Phoebe . A disquieting recollection recurred of her peering out of herp121mother 's kitchen and calling out for him to come back . What was it she had said ? " I wo n't be left behind . I love you , Matt . " And , " I 'll follow you to the ends of the earth if need be . " Well , no matter how much Phoebe had meant it at the moment , most likely she 'd gotten bravely over those heroics . Such were to be expected from a young female in the midst of a crisis . All the same he wondered what had become of her , whether her redgoldhair still glistened as brightly in the sunlight and whether her smile was as quick as ever . " Good . " Greenway 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over here , son , and lemme teach you arithmetic as she is learned in the Western Department ! " He shuffled papers on his desk until he found several bills . He passed one over . " What do you read there ? " " Says H.B. and C.S. Blood , Commission Merchants , have sold Tobias Greenway two gross of horse collars and two gross of mule collars at six dollars and seventy-five cents each . " " What would you price ' em to Colonel Sherrod ? " " Eight dollars , maybe ? " Greenway 's guffaws made the whole untidy " office " resound . " Ai n't you the innocent ? " he jeered . " Listen , Everett , us contractor fellers nowadays wo n't touch nothin ' do n't show a hundred-fifty percent profit ! " Matt 's jaw sagged . He then did some rapid calculation . Four gross of horse and mule collars would come to five hundred seventy-six items . If a hundred and fifty percent profit were to be made on each of those collars  --  ? At long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother endlessly had drilled him in mental arithmetic . Why , he 'd have to charge sixteen dollars eighty-seven cents per collar ! This , multipliedby four gross , would fetch a net of  --  he gasped  --  of $5,829.12 ! A parabola of tobacco juice spurted from Greenway 's loose lips onto the floor . " Makes you blink , do n't it ? Do n't look so damn ' startled . And that 's the profit on only one little deal . " " But  --  but , Mr. Greenway , surely nobody in his right mind would pay such a price for horse collars ? " " Would n't they ? Approach him right and Colonel Sherrod will . Remember , wagon trains , field artillery batteries and their ammunition wagonshave got to be equipped . " Greenway settled back and his spring chair creaked under his bulk . " Now when you deal in wheels , forage-wagon bodies , ambulances , limbers and caissons , a feller does a heap better . " The contractor grinned . " Of course the real money 's to be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hall and glanced out , then lowered his voice before he said , " in shipping certain kinds of supplies downriver  --  below Cairo . "  |p122Matt  's broad features went scarlet . " You mean running contraband to Rebels ? " He started to shake his head , and half rose from his chair so strongly it went against his grain to deal with the enemy . Then he remombered ; for nearly a month now it had been a case of Matthew Everett versus the world . " Us contractors do n't talk such a way , " sharply reproved the contractor . " Us fellers simply trade downriver . ' Understand ? Now come over here . I 'll let you buy in your stake on a deal in anchor chain , then horse collars and a couple hundred rotten old tents . They 've been forgotten in a warehousesince the war with Mexico till I found ' em . Yes , sir , soon 's your Provost 's license to trade shows up , and it should within forty-eight hours , you 'll head for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't put too many questions . I figger , son , you 'll get the hang of things quick enough . Well , here 's luck . " During fifteen minutes or so the contractor continued to hold forth , listing for his new associate the names of certain dealers , the commodities they dealt in and their general reputation . Greenway 's huge shoulders hunched themselves forward . " Got it ? You 'd better remember all this . Ai n't you paying me ten percent for the money I 'm advancing for you to buy the stuff on your own ? And me , well , we 're splitting the profits  --  until I get my license back . Now this here is merchandisethat brings the best profit . " Greenway reeled off , and Matt memorized , a brief list of those commodities in especially short supply . When feet came tramping up the corridor Greenway offered a moist hand . Matt accepted it , but had to suppress a shiver of revulsion . " You ca n't be squeamish , you poor bastard , " he reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsecar terminal . Philo should be awaiting him there . Suspiciously Matt eyed his diminutive , ever-restless companion . " Say , just what kind of a place is this Myrtle Hotel ? " " Like I said  --  reasonable rates , clean and handy to the business dis-trict . " " Respectable ? " Matt unslung his woodsman 's pack , and settled it between his knees while directing a sympathetic glance at the two weary old nags that stood with gaunt heads held low to the manure-sprinkled slush . They really should have been given blankets for it was beginning to snow . " It ai n't no sporting house if that 's what you 're thinkin ' , " Philo announced , then grinned . " But I expect there might be a few females living there without their husbands . In wartime a lot of men go away or get themselves killed . "  |p123More  than a little drunk , the bottle-nosed horsecar driver came lurchingout of a saloon across the snow-covered road , climbed onto the horsecar'splatform and cursed under his breath as he lashed his pitiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kerosene lamp partially illuminated the interior of the car and revealed only a couple of tired-appearing mechanicswho promptly fell asleep , a long-legged cavalry corporal wearing bright yellow chevrons and stripes down breeches of sky-blue , and a hardfacedyoung bawd . These last two , sublimely ignored Philo 's obvious interest , embraced and fell to kissing noisily until the corporal 's rakish dark blue kepi , adorned by a pair of crossed brass sabres , fell onto the floor and he broke off to retrieve it . Philo said , " Now then  --  just what kind of a deal did you make with fat-cat Greenway ? For ten percent it ought to be a beauty . " Matt steadied himself against the horsecar 's bumping lurches . " Well , he 's going to get me  --  get what 's called a permit to trade ' from the Provost Marshal . It 'll be made out in my name , but , " he added quickly and with a reassuring smile , " you can trade under it as a silent partner and it 'll cost you nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointment . " I suppose you 'll have to pay through the nose for that permit ? " " I expect so . But then Mr. Greenway 's going to put me in touch with Colonel Sherrod who lets considerable purchasing contracts for the Army . Next he 's going to introduce me to a Mr. Bullwinkle here in town . He 's from Memphis , Tennessee , and does n't exactly go around talking about his sympathies in this war . " " God ! Maybe you did n't get skinned so bad after all . " Philo nodded with breath vapors drifting in silvery clouds about his head . " Now , and this is right important , just what does he figger the Army is keenest to buy and what might Mr. Bullwinkle especially be craving ? " Matt frowned , merging straight yellow brows into a single line . Somehowhe still could n't quite cotton to this business , for all that he haddetermined to win himself a tidy fortune before emigrating to the little town of Portland in Oregon . Many New Englanders had settled there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Sherrod needs mostly iron chain , blocks and tackles and hemp cable big enough to serve for breechings  --  whateverthose are  --  on cannons . " " Good ! Good ! " Briskly Philo rubbed his well-tended hands together . " I 'll start nosing around , Matt , and , holding a pilot 's license like I do , I 'll find what we want by way of a freight boat somewhere . " As the horsecar rattled on Philo canted his head towards Matt and murmured in an undertone , " Now do n't you buy up Big Pig 's contract in too big a hurry  --  iffen you work on the Benton a while you 'll learn what'sp124in short demand at the shipyard . I hear Jim Eads soon 'll be layin ' down five more gunboats . Yessir , pays to know what 's needed bad and what 's hard to come by . " " All right . I 'll delay quitting and feel better for it . " " Course once we get set we ai n't paying that damn ' fat-cat Greenway any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too smart for his own good . Imagine hooking a greenhorn so hard ! " " Hold on , " Matt objected hotly . " I agreed to pay Mr. Greenway for six months and I shook hands on it . " Speculatively he regarded the small , untidy figure beside him . " Somehow , Philo , I do n't think I 'd cross Mr. Greenway were I you . He knows this city like a book and he does n't look to me like a man who 'd take kindly to getting bilked . " " What if he does n't ? " The Kentuckian stiffened , and a curious deadly gleam shone in his small jet eyes . " My young friend , ' t is obvious you 've a heap to learn ; here in St. Louie we 're all out for the main chance and it 's a case of dog eat dog . I suppose you were impressed with the fat cat 's trick with his derringers ? Look ! " In a movement so fast that it defied being followed Daingerfield produced a stiletto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kinder surprised , ai n't you ? If I could n't produce cutlery or artillery about twice as quick as yer friend Greenway , I would n't be living this minute . When I allowed I 've killed more than one man I was n't lying  --  for once . " All in an instant that slim , evil , blue-gray blade had disappeared  --  up Daingerfield 's sleeve  --  and he laughed softly . " Just let good old Philo Daingerfield in on that trading . Your permit 'll come in a couple of days and we 'll begin piling up coin . We 'll go well together , see if we do n't . Me , I got more faults than a dog has fleas , but I ai n't forgot that time you backed me up on the train . Yessir , we 'll be wearin ' pearls in our shirtfronts six months from now . " " Unless , of course , " Matt pointed out , " Greenway gets you done in . " " He wo n't , " the Kentuckian assured . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want him to guess how much smarter I am than him . " He fell silent and the car bumped onwards through ever-increasing snow . The soldier had undertaken to explore his companion 's soiled petticoatsso boldly that eventually she slapped his hand away with an assumed air of outraged innocence . " Park Street ! Park Street ! " The driver bawled without bothering to open the door . " Next stop 's Hick'ry . " In lively curiosity Matt stared out into the street which , despite the falling snow , was busy . Drays , wagons , carriages and travellers on horsebackappeared and became lost to sight in the storm . Numbers of soldiers , laborers , clerks and other civilians hurried along with heads bent againstp125the wind . Saving Boston , of which he had seen practically nothing , this was the biggest city he had ever beheld . Did not St. Louis boast a population of approximately 170,000 , exclusive of the troops stationed there ? They pushed aside the horsecar 's sliding door , paid the somewhat sobered driver five cents in tiny scrip and descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign reading , " Thos . Lynch . Slave Dealer &; Auctioneer . " It was affixed to a big grim structure the windows of which were heavily barred . From a passerby Philo ascertained that the Myrtle Hotel was situated on Hickory Street between Valle and Ham Streets . Presently the lights of a three-storey building loomed ahead and a big black-and-yellow swing board proclaimed that here stood the Myrtle Hotel . From its architecture Matt judged that this must once have been an imposing private residence . Apparently encroaching business structures had driven the owner further westward , probably in the direction of Tower Grove Park . Lamplights glowing within momentarily gilded the whirling snowflakes . Indoors someone was playing " Old Zip Coon " on a badly tuned piano and bursts of loud laughter indicated that this hostelry promised to be far from a dull place . Behind the registration desk stood an individual so enormously fat that an ellipse had been sawed out of the desk 's edge in order to accommodate his monumental belly . Monsieur Henriot 's thinning black hair had been slicked down flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high that Philo afterwards commented that he was existing but a short jump removed from apoplexy . Flanking the proprietor stood a hatchet-faced female clad in a black silk gown cut in the most conservative of styles . Her complexion was that of old ivory effectively emphasized by jet earrings and a jet necklacesupporting a huge cross of the same sombre-hued stone . Her lips were fthin and pale purple ; and her nonexistent eyebrows had been supplanted 11 by two thin lines of mascara . " This elegant establishment was recommended to us by our good friend Tobias Greenway , " Philo announced with a hint of patronage . " Alors . Then you are antis of Monsieur Greenway ? " boomed the proprietor . " Yes , " replied Daingerfield easily . " We shall each require a good-sized room with comfortable furniture and a big bed . " " You must be prepared to pay well for such . " " We are . We shall accept nothing but your best . " The proprietor 's moon-like visage wreathed itself in smiles and his pudgy fingers closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mme. Henriot promptly placed a hand bear/ing an enormous red gold wedding band across the registry book . " First one must inspect your passes from the Provost Marshal . " Meanwhile her eyes as small , black and bright as her jewellery , narrowly scanned Daingerfield'swell-worn and rumpled finery , then with less disapproval viewed the tall , weather-beaten young fellow with the bold dark brown eyes , yellow hair and country-cut garments . " Why , yes ma'am , " Matt produced his pass , also his copy of the work contract with Callahan &; Grogan . Madame Henriot 's expression did not relax in the least as she scanned them . " Bigre , a contract carpenter , hein ? " She sniffed , returned the identifications . " You , the leetle one . I do not theenk Monsieur Greenway he would have sent me such a one . I shall ask heem . You , Monsieur Evairette , may have a room but your companion , non pas . " Whereupon Monsieur Henriot turned purple and exploded into staccato French wildly waving his arms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the woman in black shrugged so violently that a huge ring of keys at her belt softly jingled . " Thees ees your property , Jacques , so have your way , " hissed the patronne . " But you , the leetle one , do not forget that thees ees a respectablehouse so you weel not wear boots to bed . Neither weel you drink een your room nor weel you entertain women there . I repeat , thees ees a very respectable hotel . " As if to raise a question on that point , a door opened upstairs and released loud peals of feminine laughter and piano music . Then sounded a shrill squeal as if some girl 's bottom had been soundly pinched . " We 'll give you no trouble , ma'am , " Matt gravely reassured her . " We 've so much work to do there 'll be no time for nonsense . " A giggle prompted him to turn about and glance upwards . Peering through the banisters were a pair of merry gray-green eyes . He caught an impression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black hair . " Zut ! " snapped Madame Henriot . " I must go upstairs . That Leonie must be neglecting her company . " JAMES B. EADS ' YARD at Carondelet had been located along a low slope which descended to the Riviere des Peres , a minor tributary to the Mississippi , and consisted of six long shiphouses lying at right angles to the river . At the upper end of each shiphouse  --  which really was little morep127than a great shed  --  was situated a drafting and engineer office . At the momentfive of the six ways were unoccupied save for timbers that would be used in the flat bottoms of the next gunboats to be built for the Army along Eads ' designs . Long since , Matt Everett had discovered that a most unusual situation at present prevailed along the Ohio and the Upper Mississippi . While all Federal gunboats had been ordered , designed and built by the War Department , their navigation and the serving of their guns were undertakenby the Navy Department . The Army , however , lately had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Rebels had taken to the distressing habit of masking fieldpieces and of lying in ambush in the narrower stretches or where some vagary of the channel forced a vessel close to the bank . Crack rifle shots from the Southwestalso had taken to sniping gunboat crews at such times , as had been learned aboard the original two " timberclads " Tyler and Lexington , which had distinguished themselves in the first river action of the war  --  the Battle of Belmont . " Yep , " the boss carpenter observed while Matt checked the contents of a battered carpenters ' chest . " The Navy does the navigating and handles them big cannons and it sure gravels the hell out of them brassbound webfoots that they have to take orders from the Commanding General of the district they serves in . ' T was the Navy , though , sent Commander John Rodgers out here ' way back last summer to see what kind o ' craft was needed . ' T was him bought them timberclads which sure have proved mighty useful . " The boss carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a knothole in the floor ringed and befouled by less experiencedmarksmen . " But then the War Department stepped in and , last August , contracted with Mr. James B. Eads  --  there 's a real fine patriot for you  --  to build seven ironclads in forty-five days  --  four here at Carondelet and three at Mound City ' crost the River in Illinois . It was twenty-four hours a day and bonuses for extra work and we got ' em built . " Eads got together with a feller named Isherwood and a feller named Samuel Pook who were loaned by the Navy , and together they designed what us fellers call turtles ' ' count of , without their chimneys , they look just like that . Too bad you were n't here to see them gunboats set off for Cairo couple of weeks back . " " How were they called ? " Expertly , Matt tested the temper of a chisel with a broad thumb . He really was n't interested but he wanted to stand in with his boss . " Well now , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carondelet , of course , " the boss said . " I worked mostly on her . Mighty useful piecep128of work even if she is slower'n molasses in January . Then there was St. Louis , Louisville and Pittsburgh . " " What are the others , the ones built in Mound City , named ? " " Mound City , Cincinnati and Cairo ; you kin bet your boots them gunboatsare going to give them Rebs bad fits when they start to fight . " " I do n't know much about boats , " Matt admitted , " being as how I 've all my life lived in the backwoods of New Hampshire . How long and how wide are they ? " The boss carpenter , whose name was Kniesche , substituted a new keyholesaw for one that was bent and about worn-out . " I 'll describe the Carondelet on account of I know her inside an ' out . Well , let 's see , she 's a flat-bottomed sternwheeler  --  no ribs , just a frame . She 's five hundred and twelve tons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet wide  --  " "  --  in the beam , you mean , " corrected a passing steamfitter . " Why n't you use the right term ? Navy boys do n't like for you to speak of width . " " It 'll always be width ' to me , " Kniesche replied seriously . " Now , Everett , like I was saying , these gunboats are fifty feet wide and draw six feet  --  account of all their armor . " " I would n't think six feet was so much , " Matt commented . " For these waters it 's a hell of a lot . Noticed them big steamboats tied up along the levee ? You wo n't believe it , being from the East , but there 's plenty of ' em do n't draw more than two foot and four inches . " Matt stared , then grinned . " Those great vessels draw just over two feet ? Shucks , Mr. Kniesche , you 're funning me . " " I ai n't . Not a bit of it . Take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gale 's wharf ; she can carry a hundred ton o ' freight on less'n twenty-two inches of water . " The boss carpenter chuckled as he returned a steel angle to the chest which was about to become Matt 's responsibility . " Last year , heard tell of a steamboat built down on the Green River that drew only eight inches , so her owners tied a watering pot to her jackstaff so 's she could slide over any bar that came up for air . Then there 's the Isaac Shelby  --  I been on her myself  --  she draws only eleven inches and they say her cap'n keeps a keg o ' beer mounted on her bow so 's if the river goes dry he can keep going on the suds . " He chuckled and spat again . " ' Course you can believe that last or not as you please , but them drafts I mentioned is true . No sir , always to find six feet of water in most of these rivers is like finding virtue in a Government contractor  --  it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Everett , we sent them four boats off into the River des Peres down yonder with their armor all bolted on . "  | " How thick is this armor ? " Despite himself Matt was becoming interested . " It 's two and a half inches of plate iron at the bow and to either side of the engines ; about one inch on the front of the pilothouse , or texas ' , as they call it here . Everything else is protected  --  if you can call it that  --  by boiler plate which will stop musket or minie balls , but nowthin ' much bigger . " A sudden furious clanging of mauls seating red-hot rivets designed to secure plate armor in position caused the shiphouse to resound so loudly that what the boss carpenter was saying as he locked the tool chest and handed the new employee its key was drowned out . When Matt could hear again the boss carpenter was saying , " Believe it or not , we built all four boats according to contract , mounted their engines and raised and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A quiet pride characterized Kniesche 's bearing and he pulled out a length of lumber . " What 's this ? " " Yellow oak . " " And this ? " " Poplar . " " And this ? " " Cedar , of course . " " And this ? " " Urn . Do n't recognize it . " " You would n't . It 's gum-maple . But you 'll do . If you do n't know , you say so . Let 's go warm our bellies with some coffee at the cook shack , " Once they were picking their way between tall stacks of lumber and great baulks of timber , Kniesche resumed his dissertation . " I tell you Jim Eads is a shining wonder . You should have seen the stuff come piling in . Wood from Minnesota , plate armor from Pittsburgh , cannons from Youngstown , and ship carpenters from the East and all up and down the rivers , and machinery from Cincinnati , Pittsburgh and from right here in town . " Yes , Everett , this here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll boil again the minute Mr. Eads starts his next lot of ironclads . Hi , uncle ! " He waved to an old colored man who came shuffling over to offer crullers from a cloth-draped basket . " Now these new gunboats , I hear , are to be considerable smaller , lighter but heavy armored and , listen to this , they 'll draw only three and a half feet , which is more like it for the kind of fighting they 'll be called on to do . " The thermometer , Matt sensed , certainly had risen and now hovered close around the freezing mark . There must have been a real thaw up in the Northwest for great chunks of ice had begun drifting down upon St.p130Louis , ice created far up the Missouri , because , as Kniesche put it , it was dirty ice showing dark streaks of mud and gravel in it . " The Mississippi , risin ' as she does in free territory , is clear  --  the Missouri 's dirty , like the slave trade . " " You ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kniesche predicted . " Most of the fellers Big Pig Callahan brought out are working on the Benton  --  she used to be Eads ' own snag boat and was called Submarine7 before they named her for the Senator . " They picked their way across a deep litter of timber ends , chips and the dung dropped by teams that hauled heavy lumber down to the yards from the end of the Iron Mountain Railroad tracks . " Can you do real honest-to-God cabinetwork ? " " Tolerable well . At least they used to say so back home , " Matt replied . Home . How incredible , how amazing that less than a month actually had elapsed since he had deserted Dexter to go to murder his father . He swallowed hard . Criminently ! It was just a month ago today that he 'd escorted Phoebe to the Woodruff s ' corn husking bee and , having chanced on a red ear , had been privileged to buss her right in front of everybody . Godfreys , how they 'd blushed and enjoyed it . Dear Phoebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dark blue eyes . " In that case I 'll set you to work on the officers ' wardroom aboard the Benton . She 's the oddest craft you 'll witness come a month of Sundays . Mr. Eads said she 'd do fine for a gunboat and Commander Rodgers wanted to refit her but Isherwood , his Chief Engineer , turned her down . " Once they had gulped sour-tasting tin-cupfuls of stale but smoking hot coffee , he led the way up a catwalk treacherous with mud and melting ice . Under Shed Number Six lay the strangest-appearing craft Matt could ever have imagined . The former snag boat Submarine 7 was a big boat , a thousand tons in burden , and had been very powerfully built to uproot snags and deadheads from the river bottom . Even a landsman such as Matt Everett could appreciate her formidability . " You can see , " the boss pointed out , " she has twin hulls which Mr. Eads has bridged over . By grabs , she 'll swallow the worst them Rebs can throw at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch armor and she 'll mount sixteen cannons ; three more than the Carondelet and the rest . Hi , Phil . " A big , red-haired man whose beard flared like an exploding shell peered down from a scaffold above that great rust-colored hulk reposing on the stocks . Sunlight streaming through a series of windows at the shed 's top revealed a swarm of armorers , ironworkers and steamfitters hard at work on this ungainly vessel . Derricks creaked and whined and the donkey engines which poweredp131them chuffed self-importantly in fashioning this ungainly monster . How many men in the months to come would the Benton 's broadsides slay , cripple or terrify into surrender ? Fascinated , Matt gazed upon the new ironclad . ' What a vast and deadly engine of destruction this was , obedient to the will of her masters be they Northern or Southern . She could cause hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage , dress hundreds of women in black , sear and maim unguessable numbers of mankind . " By God , Kniesche , I 'll bet you fifty dollars I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite the dank and penetrating chill he was wiping a beading of sweat from his forehead . " Them engines they 've got in her now will never push all this goddamn ' iron they 're layin ' onto her at nine miles an hour , let alone upstream . Mark my words , no matter what Jim Fads claims , she 'll prove clumsy as a mired hog . " " Ca n't nawthin hurt her in her guts though , " pointed out a sallowfacedarmorer at work on her well-armored and circular pilothouse mounted forward of the smokestacks  --  a new concept . " Rebels ai n't got airy a gun can punch through them three and a half inches . If I was to fight , which I do n't aim to do , I 'd like to be inside this here Benton . None o ' yer godamn ' timberclads or boiler iron vessels for Joe Browne . Hey , you Jim ! Get down there and tell them dunderheads to re-rig tackles on that for'ard plate . " Matt kept quiet , so utterly amazed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironclad 's twin hulls appeared to be spaced some twenty feet apart but strongly joined above water . Aft , a long and powerfulstern paddlewheel raised its buckets almost to the shed 's roof supports . Upon them a multitude of sparrows twittered and fluttered . Now and then a slate-gray pigeon plummeted earthwards to retrieve crumbs from some workman 's lunch . Heart in mouth , Matt followed his boss up a narrow plank walk which shivered and swayed beneath their weight fit to give a man the fantods . " Now this here will be the wardroom . Yonder 's some yellow pine . You 're to build double bunks with it to either side . Can you read draw-ings ? " " I guess so . " Matt had to shout , so loud was the reverberation and deafening clangor of the mauls driving rabbets into the casemate . He tramped over to a pile of resinous , pitch-leaking boards . Godfreys ! They were so roughly finished he 'd have to spend long hours in planing to get them sufficiently smooth to pass inspection . Here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and noticed that most of them seemed to be working as if they 'd their hearts in their work . Poor fools . How curious to hear how the Eastern shipbuilders referred to this or that part of the vessel by contrast withp132the unnautical phraseology employed by steamboat carpenters from western rivers or the Great Lakes . There could be no doubt whatever that any real shipbuilder from Maine , New Hampshire or Massachusetts had forgotten more about the fine art of constructing a vessel than any of these raw-boned Western Yahoos would ever learn . It became a revelation for the New Englander to learn how intimate with war St. Louis had become . People in omnibuses , saloons and other public places still discussed the sanguinary Union defeat at Wilson 's Creek last August the tenth , and the Rebel defeat at Springfield , Missouri , later on . Mingled among troops wearing every shade of blue were many women in black moving along Gratiot , Chouteau and Seventh Streets , many more than one would have encountered in Bangor , Portland or even in Boston . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern sympathies  --  the socially elect , well-to-do and powerful merchantsin particular  --  the city seethed under the chilling administration of military law . To Matt 's complete amazement not a few of those actually engaged in the construction of the Benton talked , at least , like red-hot Rebels and gloried in how bitterly they hated  --  and feared  --  St. Louis ' very sizable German population which they referred to contemptuously as " Black Republican Dutchmen . " Several times following the outbreak of hostilities , and Nathaniel Lyon 's capture of Camp Jackson where had collected a majority of local Secessionist fire-eaters , terrifying rumors circulated that these German-Americans were about to massacre anyone accused of the least Seccessionist sympathy . He had learned , too , much concerning MajorGeneralFremont 's energetic but arrogant and often ill-advised administrationof the then Department of the West . Now it had been renamed the Missouri District . Not yet could the Union element in St. Louis perceive that flamboyant figure 's many solid accomplishments in the face of enormous difficulties and a complete lack of support from Washington . They recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual inaccessibility , as well as his unauthorizedexpenditure on shady contracts . Apparently this intrepid cartographer of the unexplored Far West and undoubted winner of California for the United States had offended local patriots by surrounding himself at his headquarters in the luxurious Brant house on Chouteau Street with such dashing foreigners as Captain Charles D'Armand , a Frenchman , the Hungarian Major Zagonyi and some Italian captains , Cottaves and Saccippi among them . How people had used to hoot the General 's dazzling uniformed bodyguard . It had numberedthrice that protecting President Lincoln !  |p133When  , next day , Matt set to work on the officers ' quarters aboard the Benton , he recaptured a degree of well-being such as had not been his since that dreadful interview in Edwin Stetson 's office . All that week as he sawed , planed and joined he kept his ears open . Fortunes indeed were being made right and left , so great was the haste of Federal authorities to get a flotilla in being . At General Halleck 's command they paid little heed to the prices , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their supply officers . By Godfreys ! he intended to share in this scramble for riches and in no small way , either . Every time he remembered Sachem Hill 's lofty chimneys , handsome entrance and the rich panelling and spacious apartments within , he felt affronted . All this now undoubtedly belonged to the Widow Cosby , Augustus , Decius , and that young virago called Flavia . To his great surprise he had to admit he wanted to see more of his handsome and whimsical half-brother ; doubtless this was due to his lifelongyearning for kinfolk . The name Adams recurred in that connection . When , if ever , would he come up with the " Reverend " D. Adams  --  Josiah Cosby 's partner in that monstrous deception and betrayal ? The impostor might well be dead , but he intended to go on inquiring . While nailing in place a length of moulding he found himself wonderingabout Phoebe Whidden . How terribly stricken the girl had appeared , so round-eyed and tight-lipped in her mother 's kitchen . Of course Phoebe was much too level-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , it was mighty pleasing to realize that this lovely and steady girl had cared for him enough even to consider so mad a project . Around four of the afternoon when light in the long , dank boat shed commenced to fail , coal-oil flares were ignited and work on this great , ungainly gunboat was resumed by a new shift of craftsmen . While the New Englander was putting away his tools , Kniesche , the boss carpenter , appeared to inspect Matt 's efforts and , to that thoroughly chilled individual 's relief , pronounced his work better than satisfactory . " They must turn out real cabinetmakers where you hail from , " said he , biting off a chew of tobacco . " That 's as purty a piece of joinin ' work as I 've seen about this boatyard . Say , Everett , there 's to be a big parade tomorrow . Some of our best regiments  --  the First Missouri Artillery , Birge 's Sharpshooters , Colonel Woods ' Thirteenth Infantry  --  hope that number do n't prove unlucky  --  are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell this here Gen'ral Grant is fixing to take some forts the Rebs have thrown up along the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers . Come along , " he invited , " you 'll enjoy watching them damned Dutchmen drill . Old Franz Sigel 's Third Volunteers is something to see.  |p134Colonel  Hassendubel 's been drillin ' their tails off near two months so now they 've got a snap to ' em like none of our Butternuts show . " Glowing under the old boss carpenter 's approval Matt heaved his tool chest onto his shoulder and lugged it up a treacherous catwalk for stowage in the Eads &; Nelson 's Submarine Boat Company 's storeroom . He was pulling on his coat when Eads ' chief mechanic came tramping over with long , unshaven jaws working steadily at a huge quid . " Say , Everett , ai n't you friends with a feller calls himself Philo Daingerfield ? Come out here in the same gang ? " Matt caught his breath . " Why , yes . What of it ? " " Well , it 's two days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him , you remind him he 's still under contract . Iffen he do n't turn up tomorrey , by God , I 'll turn his name over to the Provost 's men . Maybe yer friend would like to find himself playing tag with them rats they raise in Gratiot Street prison ? " He frowned , wagged a blunt forefinger . " Me an ' Mr. Eads , we do n't tolerate no such trifling , being 's we got to get this here Benton in the water ' fore the end o ' next week . " " If I see him I 'll tell him , " Matt promised . He felt downright annoyed . No matter what bright plans loomed in the offing it was n't right to undertakean agreement and not live up to it , at least for a while . Gloomily he joined a trickle of laborers ascending a muddy road leading towards the end of the Iron Mountain 's spur and waited among mounds of building materials , engine parts and rusting sheets of armor plate until the " General Winfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sparks from a bell-shaped stack , appeared pushinga pair of dilapidated passenger cars before it . On the front platform stood the diminutive figure of Philo Daingerfield smoking a larger seegar . The Kentuckian , no longer clad in sorry finery but resplendent in a furtrimmedcloth overcoat , a round beaverskin hat , waved a cheerful greeting , then ducked back into the car which lacked glass in most of its windows . " Well , Matt , " he chuckled , when his companion dropped onto a wooden bench beside him , " reckon you can put a big red ring around this date . While you been hammering and sawing I been gettin ' around St. Louie . Yes , sir . I 've looked up our friend Simon Quirk . " He directed an anxious glance at his big companion . " You 've kept your money safe ? " " Sure . Belted on  --  the most of it . " " That 's fine , finer than duck feathers , ' cause tonight , " excitement lit his pinched and pointed features , " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to turn us a pretty penny  --  yessir , a mighty pretty penny . " " What sort of a deal ? Nothing crooked ? " " Crooked ? Oh , no ! " Philo looked positively pained . " Just a matter of selling the Government some sets of mule harness I 've bought cheap thatp135will clear us ' round a hundred and fifty percent . From the profits I 'll buy some hospital cots I 've located and make us another killing . Why , a week from today we should have cleared five thousand apiece . " " Five thousand ? " Godfreys ! That was near twice as much as ' most anybodyaround Dexter or Newport Junction could earn in a year . Good God , what could n't be accomplished with a start of five thousand dollars ? Silently he resolved to play this lucrative game for all it was worth , for as long as it lasted . Had n't Josiah Cosby won himself a tidy fortune despite starting from scratch ? Whether he liked it or not , he was still Cosby 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourse , conducted of course in such a low voice that no one could overhear . " Very soon I reckon we 'll have enough capital to charter a steamboat called the Western Arrow I 've got my eye on . She 's small , about one hundred and ninety tons , but fast as a scared cat and draws only eighteen inches . First , till we get to know the River real well , we 'll haul troops and supplies down to Cairo . There 's good money in that , by the way . Later  --  " he laid a forefinger beside his nose  --  " mebbe we 'll slip on down the River a piece where certain kinds of supplies  --  " he emphasized the word ever so slightly  --  " will bring real fancy prices , say New Madrid or Columbia , for instance . " " But  --  but they 're in Rebel territory ! " Philo considered his companion in mock surprise . " Now whoever saidthey were n't ? " he demanded softly . " Good thing you got off early . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebration party planned for tonight . " He cocked his head to one side and winked . " There 's a right pretty little girl living at the Myrtle and , well , she 's noticed you about and aims to meet you . Do n't frown like that , this Leonie 's a pippin , full of ginger and pretty as a speckled pup . " He sighed gustily and fell to smoothing the fur of his beaverskin hat . " You big , well set-up young fellers win all the breaks . Damned if you do n't . " VI LRONIE DULACTHE MYRTLE HOTEL 'S small but ornate private dining room glowed with light cast by candles supported by four German silver candelabras . In the well-heated atmosphere circulated the odors of rich sauces mingled with the smell of bourbon whiskey and the bluish fragrance of real Habana seegars . A few paper flowers of garish hue drooped upon the disorderedp136table above a scattering of dirty dishes and half-emptied wine glasses of varying design . Due to the heat Simon Quirk belched and , in order to close blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slightly unbalanced a plump blonde perched upon his lap . She giggled shrilly . Long since the contractor had undone a thick black silk cravat permitting his collar points to thrust like misplaced horns from , either side of his bull neck . Raising his glass a trifle unsteadily , he nodded to his guests . " Well , boys , here 's wishing the Western Arrow a quick , safe and goddamn ' prosperous trip south  --  and back . " " And sky-high prices at New Madrid , " amended Philo Daingerfield in drunken gravity . Because the Kentuckian 's bold-eyed and frizzle-haired companion loomed almost twice his size she was not occupying Philo 's lap much of the time but sat beside him with a plump arm twined about his scrawny neck . " What say , Matt ? " He might not have spoken for all the attention Matt paid him , so absorbed was the New Englander in gazing into the slightly slanting graygreeneyes of the slim young woman known about the Myrtle Hotel as Leonie Dulac . " Hi , Matt , wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' us a toast . He 's drinkin ' to a venture that should set us on the road towards gilded halls and silken couches . " He winked at his well-upholstered companion and patted her bosom . " Gilded halls . That 's pretty good , ai n't it ? " " Now , Philo , you 're shorely gettin ' drunk , " giggled the big brunette and noisily kissed the top of Philo 's semi-bald head . Matt remained completely oblivious . He was far too occupied in attempting to steady the uneasy rocking of the room and to focus his gaze upon those fascinating , long-lashed eyes peering so trustingly up into his own . Godfreys ! How those candle flames dipped and swayed . Yessiree . For all that this champagne wine tasted innocent , it packed a blow like a logger 's ax , especially when poured onto several jiggers of prime Kentucky bourbon . He was only aware of the nearness of Leonie . Her bright , neatly delineated lips curved ever so gracefully , invitingly , and her bosom glistenedas white as snow on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Leenie , you 're wonderfully pretty ! " he mumbled , annoyed that his tongue should have grown so clumsy and his lips so slack . " No , you 're more than pretty . You 're lovely as an angel come straight down from Heaven . " She bent close and a tiny gold locket suspended from a black velvetp137band about her throat gleamed briefly as she peered eagerly into his face . " Oh , Monsieur Matt ! Must you mock a poor , plain girl like me ? " " I mean it . I 'll lick anybody says you 're not pretty as an angel , " mumbled Matt staring about in muddled belligerence . Fortunately Quirk and Philo were too intimately absorbed with their companions to notice . Quickly Mademoiselle Leonie poured champagne and treated him to a deliberate , almost langorous smile . " Then I thank you , Monsieur Matt , from the bottom of my heart . To be so admired by such a  --  a strong and handsome gentleman is too much an honor . Come , let us drink to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owlishly Matt regarded her piquant , pink-white features and the carefullyarranged ringlets of a lustrous , raven's-wing black . " What 's gone wrong with your fortunes ? " he demanded over the strident laughter of Philo 's buxom companion . " One would not wish to sadden so happy , so beautiful a dinner . " " Tell me , please , because I  --  I like you a lot , Leenie , " which was as close as he could come to pronouncing her name . " Trust me ; I can understand . I 've had a hard time lately , too . " The weary-looking blonde called Vera smiled loosely over a shoulder bared by Simon Quirk 's insistence . " Go ahead , Leenie dearie , tell him the sad , sad story of your life . The ten-dollar one . " Leonie spat something in French , then her shapely hand , adorned by several rings of doubtful quality , crept out to caress Matt 's . " So you 've been in hard luck ? " he insisted heavily . " Ah , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was only last year . " Philo sat back , draped an arm about his massive companion 's now completelyrevealed bosom and winked at the host in his usual bird-like fashion . " Sure , speak up , sis , " drawled Mr. Quirk . " Le 's hear the story of your downfall . " " I am not downfallen ! " blazed Leonie , gray-green eyes suddenly narrowedand glittering with rage . " I am good girl ! " Quirk bellowed with laughter . " Good ? Who said you ai n't ? Hell , you 're wonderful ! All the boys say so . " " I resent that ! " Matt tried to gain his feet , but instantly Leonie 's hand closed over his wrist . " No ! Let there be no fighting . I hate it , " she pleaded and hurriedly touched her glass to his . " He is a coarse one , your friend Monsieur Simon , so it is no wonder his jokes are the same . " Because he had become occupied in the audible enjoyment of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lovely , black/haired girl whose great , wide eyes seemed to be forever viewing the world in trustful innocence , leaned over the table so far that most of a pair of pale , gently swelling bosoms became exposed by a daringly decollete gown of yellow-and-black brocade . " Oh , Matt , " she murmured brushing his ear with full , shiny and dark red lips , " one so easily can tell you have the heart of a good and generous gentleman . One sees also that you too have suffer ' ! I will tell you that , until last year , my papa was important sugarcane planter in Avoyelles Parish . He owned Beau Sejour , a plantation near Hambourg on the River . But then Papa 's enemies , of which he owned many because he was so proud , so honorable , plotted his ruin . " Leonie 's luscious mouth quivered as she delved hastily into the front of her canary-yellow-and-black gown and produced a frothy bit of handkerchief with which she dabbed carefullyat first one eye and then the other . Philo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously prepared to enjoy Leonie 's discourse to the fullest . " Oh , it was the mos ' unfair , mos ' cruel , how those villains combined to bankrupt my poor papa . " Tears brimmed in the girl 's eyes . " Then poof ! everything was gone  --  our lands , our slaves , our house . A proud Dulac could never support a shame so great , so he  --  he  --  " " He what ? " Matt queried quietly . " He shoot himself ! " Leonie 's small white hand aimed its forefinger at lustrous blue-black ringlets trembling above her temple . She commenced delicately to sniff . " As if this were not enough sorrow , when Maman , my two little brother ' and I seek refuge in New Orleans , the coup-de-bar , called by the American yellow fever , ' spread all through that city . It was bad that summer . They all die and now lie buried in Cemetery of St. Honore . " Matt placed an arm about the girl 's narrow and sloping white shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . What dreadful experiencesyou must have had ! " As Leonie 's arms slipped upwards to join hands behind his neck , he became aware of a scent , delicate , yet undoubtedly titillating to the senses . How very white her skin appeared by contrast to her raven tresses ! " It was mos ' terrible . For me there was nothing . Papa 's enemies remainedwithout mercy and I could not stay in New Orleans so I sell the last of poor Maman 's jewels and come upriver two months ago , just before the Confederate and Union armies stop traffic upon the Mississippi . " " Oh , for God 's sake , Leenie . Get your story straight , " grunted Quirk . " River 's been closed for six months . " Leonie glared at the interrupter but continued in piteous , tragic tones , " And so  --  I come to St. Louis . In vain have I seek employment as ap139governess , as an instructress in French but now that this war , this soterriblewar is fought none have money for such purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders rose in a forlorn shrug  --  " and so Monsieur Matt , if in two days I do not find a position  --  " her intriguinglydimpled chin trembled pitifully "  --  I shall do as my poor dear papa . " " Good God ! " cried Matt , completely aghast . " Why , that 's too awful to even think about ! " " For we Dulacs , death is nothing to be feared , " she declared in a low voice . " Yes , I think I will throw myself into the River . I have heard drowning is not an unpleasant sensation , besides , water so cold should kill me quickly . " Leonie now commenced to weep softly , like the wind in a spruce grove . " Look here , you simply must n't do such a dreadful thing , " Matt protested , and fumbled in his pocket . " How much money would you need to keep on hunting a job for another week ? " " Oh , no , Monsieur Matt ! " She rolled genuinely wet eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so noble , but , helas , I can not allow you . " " Why not ? " " A Dulac can not accept money from strangers . " Lord , but she looked lovely in her distress , and that perfume she wore was so delicious  --  almost intoxicating . " Leonie , you must listen to me . Maybe you have n't known me extra-long , but I 'm not a stranger , and I intend to get to know you better , a great deal better . How much does your room here in the hotel cost you ? " " Seven dollars a week , " Leonie informed shyly . " But indeed , Monsieur Matt , really , I can not permit  --  " From the slender remains of his roll of banknotes , Matt stripped a ten-dollar bill . " Here . Oblige me and accept this . You can pay me back if you want when you land a position .

" Leonie flung herself onto his lap , twined arms about his neck and fervently pressed her soft and brilliant mouth to his . " Oh , Monsieur Matt ! In very truth you have save ' my life ! "  |p140THE  STATION MASTER at Odin Junction , where the Ohio &; Mississippi Railroad crossed the Illinois Central , was a big , moon-faced German who wore a red-and-white " Dutch blanket " overcoat . He nodded heavily . " Ja . Dot train I remember . Here it vas Big Pig Callahan his party in two split ; vun gompany for Cairo , vun to St. Louis . " " I  --  I presume you 've no idea about which of his men went where ? " pled Phoebe Whidden peering up from under a travelling bonnet of dark green grosgrain lined in black ruffles . " Please try to remember . It 's  --  it 's , oh , so important . " " Fraulein ! Gladly I vould help , but how could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , dear ! " Phoebe wrung mittened hands in an access of helplessness . How exasperating successfully to have traced Callahan and Grogan 's labor party thus far only to come up against this dreadful dilemma . She had no idea whether she should purchase a ticket for Cairo or for Illinoistown ; she only retained sufficient money to reach one destination . From behind gleaming , steel-rimmed spectacles the station master feasted his eyes upon this straight-backed and clear-eyed young woman . She was beautiful in a serene sort of way ; her red-gold hair was so neat , tidy-looking and somehow she had remained clean despite the smoke and grime and scant toilet facilities . Twenty-four hours she must have spent travelling westwards from Cincinnati ! " Bitte , Fraulein . Me , I vould look first for this Herr Everett in St. Louis ; ja , because much easier it is to buy passage on a steamboat bound from St. Louis to Cairo than in the other direction . " " And why , pray ? " demanded Phoebe in desperate perplexity . " Because alvays from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kentucky and Tennessee . " Biting her lip Phoebe gazed out over a level expanse of fields so limitless that they stretched all the way to the horizon . Not at all did they resemble the tiny , two-and-three-acre fields so laboriously hacked out from the forest around home . " Thank you , sir . I will go to St. Louis . " " You in a sleeping car should ride , Fraulein , " the station master advised . " From here on vest most passengers are rough and drunk and are soldiers everywhere . You , so pretty , are not to be pestered in a daycoach . Ja . There is vun ladies ' sleeping car on Number Fifty-seven . "  |p141When  he mentioned the price Phoebe realized , with a sinking heart , that she now retained exactly eight dollars and seventy-five cents . God send she could quickly come up with Callahan and Grogan 's men in St. Louis ! This kindly , gold-bearded German must have sensed the acutenessof her distress for after he had written out a ticket entitling her to a built-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillow , he scribbled further . " Fraulein , " said he , " here iss name of mein sister , Mrs. Gussie Schmieler . Her mann , a Dumkopf , off to var has gone leaving her with seven kinder , but she a big heart has . Ask her advice . Maybe she with her vill let you stay until you your mann Everett find . " The station master 's pale blue eyes widened . " He iss vun lucky Kerl so pretty a young lady to run after him . " Phoebe long since had discovered that Matt , for some unfathomable reason , no longer was using the name of Hovey . " Oh , thank you ! You have been so very kind . I 'll never know how to reward you save in my prayers . " She read the written name and address until she had memorized them ; slips of paper had such an annoying way of getting lost . " Nun , " the station master grunted through the wicket , " if you vant to vash come around through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove . Maybe on the vashstand a basin , soap and a not-so dirty towel are . " What a strange and unfamiliar world ! Ohio , Indiana and now Illinois appeared incredibly flat and treeless to one reared among the rugged hills and mountains of New England . Here you never saw a hill , let alone a mountain . The Ohio and Missouri 's Train Number Fifty-seven clicked evenly along over an endless succession of yellow-brown grain fields  --  a warm spell had melted away all snow except in drifts or where there were hollows . To Phoebe the sheer immensity of these vistas was terrifying ; often the train would rattle on for minutes on end without sighting a single human habitation . Several times , though , the engineer had to slow and shriek his whistle to discourage cattle from browsing upon sere hay-grass sproutingbetween the crossties . " Gol-dern critters ! " growled the conductor . " They 'll be the death of us yet ; always on the right-of-way , especially wintertime . Ought to be a law to make these damned stupid Polacks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoebe noticed , differed decidedly from those she had seen in the East . Bunks were built solidly along both sides of the car except at its ends where benches accommodated passengers in daytime . Each bunk , she perceived , was equipped with a grimy canvas cur/tain , a pillow , two shoddy blankets and a single sheet which appeared to be far from pristine . Many of her fellow passengers in the ladies ' car were clad in black . A brakeman explained to the girl in the gray travelling cape that these ladies were journeying west to bring back the remains of their menfolk who had fallen in battle or , more frequently , had perished of disease . By contrast there sat in this car two gay and radiantly happy young women on their way to marry the men of their choice on duty in St. Louis . Also included among the voyagers in the ladies ' sleeping car was a trio of handsomely garbed , but haughty and aloof refugees from the border State of Maryland . Resentful and tight-lipped , these three ladies kept to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest of sympathy for the Union cause . The person who interested Phoebe most was a flighty but kindly appearingold lady wearing a sacque of plum-colored silk shot with green . Under a bonnet of purple velvet , trimmed in bengaline and blonde lace , two red roses were revealed next to the wearer 's plump features . Her hair had been dressed into innumerable tight little ringlets and her lips were surprisingly pink for a woman of her years . When she turned to smile across the aisle at Phoebe , the latter noted that around her neck was secured a black velvet ribbon garnished by a handsome cameo . " Ah , my dear , I perceive that you travel alone , " she volunteered in a pleasing voice . " That 's bad ; it 's even dangerous for a pretty young female in these distressing times . Permit me to present myself . I am Mrs. Wilber , a widow , alas , these past ten years . " " Oh , I 'm not afraid , " Phoebe assured her , smiling steadily . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty good fight at school . " " You  --  fight ? Dear me ! " The lady in the plum-colored sacque raised neatly mitted hands in horror and so attracted the attention of three lively and extraordinarily pretty young females who appeared to be travellingunder her aegis . Phoebe judged them to range in age from eighteen to about twenty . These , Mrs. Wilber presently explained , were young ladies from distinguishedfamilies in the East on their way to attend a seminary she maintained for genteel young women in St. Louis . There they would receiveinstruction in advanced French , polite conversation and social deportment . " Is dancing taught ? " Phoebe inquired eagerly , aware of the other 's covert but intense inspection of her person and clothes . Mrs. Wilber again raised pudgy little hands in horror . " The schottische ,  |p143|polka  and the quadrille to be sure , but certainly not that vulgar dance called the waltz , of which dear Queen Victoria so highly disapproves . " Phoebe , of course , had been aware for some time now that her garments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were hopelessly uninspired , if not downright dowdy , but so far she had never been particularly concerned over that discovery . By the light of rattling , acrid car lamps , she surveyed the truly elegant attire of Mrs. Wilber 's charges . Why , their flounced and tiered gowns looked quite as lovely as those depicted in Godey 's Ladies ' Book . Phoebe presently became conscious that the young ladies on the seats opposite were whispering about her and giggling among themselves . Mercy ! What lovely little boots one of them wore . They were brave with mother-of-pearl buttons and tassels of silver thread . Another wore Congressgaiters of gray kid showing insets of black elastic on either side . " What might you be called , my dear ? " Mrs. Wilber queried , gray curls trembling to the train 's violent jolting . " Miss Whidden ? Ah , there 's a fine old New England name  --  and will you be stopping with friends in St. Louis ? " Phoebe 's wide , dark red brows climbed a trifle . " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll admit I 'm just a little frightened . " A vast understatement . " I  --  I 'm travelling out to , " she raised her chin and levelled her voice , " marry a gentleman from home . " " Mercy ! How very romantic ! " Mrs. Wilber fluttered and tilted her cheek to one side against hands clasped in gentle enthusiasm . " I 'm sure your intended must be handsome . He 'd have to be to win the hand of so lovely a girl as you . " Phoebe blushed furiously and her honest laugh rang down the car , momentarily drowning out the monotonous clicking of wheels over rails . " Oh , Matt 's not handsome , but he is nice-looking . " From a reticule of petit-point Mrs. Wilber produced a twist of paper and offered a peppermint ball . " And where is he ? " " Why , I  --  I really do n't know . " " You do n't know ? " Mrs. Wilber 's small eyes , black and shiny as those of a canary , narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve ? St. Louis is jammed-packed with all kinds of soldiers these days . " " He 's not in the Army , as near as I know , " Phoebe replied , dropping her gaze . " That 's what worries me about finding him . " The artificial " French flowers " beneath Mrs. Wilber 's bonnet fluttered to a sharp reaction of some sort . " You mean you actually do n't have his add  --  " She broke off suddenly . " I notice that you carry no food parcel . Perhaps you would care to join my young ladies and me in a sandwich , and a morsel of fried chicken ? "  |p144Would  she ? For some time now Phoebe 's healthy young body had been craving sustenance but , because her funds were so low , she had purchasedonly a soggy apple tart for supper . Never again would she buy anything with meat in it around a railroad , not after her agonized arrival in Portland . " Oh , I really could n't ! " " Nonsense , my dear , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to meet the girls  --  I mean my proteges . Pray come over here , young ladies , I wish to present you to Miss Whidden . This , " she beamed upon a tall , slender , black-haired girl , pert and vivacious in dark red turban decorated with a long and drooping white ostrich feather , " is Miss Loretta Bentalou . Her papa is a very important  --  er  --  official of the Jersey Central Railway . And this is Miss Clairette Vansant . Her 's is one of the oldest and most distinguished families in Maryland . " " How do ? " drawled Miss Vansant , a petite blonde with bangs showing under a fashionable new " Jockey " hat . " Cha'med I 'm sure , " declared Miss Lola May Askins . She was a big , curvaceous girl possessed of huge and melting black eyes that reminded Phoebe of nothing so much as Belle , Pa 's prize Jersey cow . " And now let us sup , young ladies , " beamed Mrs. Wilber and spread a cloth over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my dear . " Mrs. Wilber 's charges fell-to with such gusto , giggling and grabbing of victuals that the refugee ladies sniffed disapprovingly and stared out of the car 's dirty windows . With considerable relish Phoebe was consuming a hard-boiled egg when , suddenly , the locomotive 's whistle commenced to shriek hysterically , franticallyfor brakes . Brakemen rushed onto the platforms but hardly had they reached their posts when the cars of Number Fifty-seven commenced to buck and jolt like wasp-stung colts . There sounded such a grinding , snapping , crackling turmoil it seemed as though a crew of lumbermenwere felling a hundred trees . The last thing that Phoebe Whidden would remember for a very long time was the jangling noise of glass being splintered , fearful screams and a sensation of being hurled violently through space . By a wavering yellow-red glare created by burning passenger coaches  --  glowing coals from the stoves had been spewed into jagged masses of splinters and other combustibles  --  Mrs. Wilber dashed disordered ringlets from her eyes . After glancing carefully about she then threw some stranger 's mantle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite unconscious in a cornfield bordering the right-of-way . Blood had commenced to streak features still lovely in colorless repose.  |p145Survivors  crouched among withered stalks trying not to notice the soulshakingshrieks and cries arising from the blazing wreck of Number Fiftyseven . " Oh , God ! " the girl known as Clairette Vansant was wailing , " I 've one hell of a big rent in my brand-new Chicago gown and my hoops are bent . Christ alone knows what 's happened to my hat . ' Train Number Fifty-seven 's fourteen cars had degenerated into a wildly heaped and shapeless line of wreckage . Its locomotive , the " General Ambrose , " lay on its side in the ditch oozing steam and smoke among the carcasses of several heavy steers which , invisible around a bend , had caused the derailment . For some reason the " General Ambrose 's " cowcatcherhad failed miserably to function . Survivors of the herd stood about bawling out their terror or staring at flames which , with each moment , were spreading in frightful rapidity . That car in which Phoebe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , like an amorous bull , over the end of the coach precedingit . For a miracle it had not yet caught fire . " Damn ' lucky thing , " laughed Clairette , tying a handkerchief about a small gash in her arm , " our car was so near the train 's end else we 'd have got our hair curled for nothing . " Uninjured male passengers directed by soldiers on leave risked their lives to haul shrieking victims from the splintered and brightly burning cars . Surviving members of the train crew secured axes and crowbars from less damaged coaches and worked frantically to prise apart riven timbers while crackling flames were commencing to spiral a hundred feet into the air . In a water-filled ditch beside the track , workers struggled to extinguish the flaming garments of shrieking , hysterical women whose voluminous hoopskirts afforded dreadfully ready fuel . " Oh , God ! Make them stop that . Stop ! " wailed Loretta Bentalou . In a sitting position in the mud she commenced to rock to and fro . She was holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its back , over her ears . " Shut up , you noisy little bitch ! ' rasped Mrs. Wilber . But the girl kept swaying back and forth , all the while uttering little whining noises . More and more smoking figures , some writhing , some significantly limp , were lugged up onto the cornfield and placed on rough mats fashioned of cornstalks ripped from convenient shooks . Exasperated , Mrs. Wilber arose , strode over to Loretta , hoisted her own ripped skirt and fetched her pretty protegee a shrewd kick on the behind . " Shut up , you damn ' silly slut ! You ai n't hurt . Get over there andp146help Clairette and Lola May care for them poor , scorched folk . I 'll ' tend to this girl myself . " As if the horror was not yet sufficient , rifle ammunition packed in one of the freight cars coupled ahead of the passenger coaches commenced to explode , sending bullets keening viciously through smoke and firelight . Although no dwelling was visible within miles of the wreck , a farm cart presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the cattle . They paid little or no attention to the wrecked train , answered all queries in guttural and incomprehensible Platt Deutsch . " You sure suffered a nasty knock , dearie , " Amy Wilber informed her unconscious companion . This was no exaggeration . By parting lustrous hair glowing copper-red in the firelight , Mrs. Wilber noticed a long gash , which proved shallow , in the strange girl 's scalp . It was bleeding freely , as was also a large lump on the side of her head . " Good thing her looks ai n't spoilt , " muttered Mrs. Wilber . " Ai n't felt such a skin in years . And them eyes of her'n . Any gent in St. Louie would go crazy . Damn ! Must stop her bleeding to death . " To create a compress and bandage Mrs. Wilber ripped some flounces from her skirt ; might just as well , her dress was ripped and muddied beyond repair . While searching for something to cover the red-haired girl , Mrs. Wilber noticed a flash of light and swiftly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fat wallet lying near . She actually commenced to grin when she came across a well-filled carpetbag  --  whose it was she had no idea  --  and propped Phoebe 's bloodied head upon it.  |p149BY  THE END of January , 1862 , that crusty yet energetic and clear-sighted commander , Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote , had collected at the mouth of the Ohio River a flotilla of the ungainliest and weirdest-appearing men-of-war ever to fly the Stars and Stripes . Swinging to their anchors or tied up to the bank above Cairo , Illinois , lay three ten-gun " timberclads " : Conestoga , Tyler and Lexington . They were so nicknamed because they carried no armor , only a protective sheathing of five-inch oak . Like nearly all steamers navigating western rivers these former Ohio River boats carried two very tall smoke pipes , or " chimneys " as the local people called them , set approximately amidships . These served engines which had been lowered from the main deck into the hold for better protection against shot and shell . Foote also commanded the huge thousand-ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although recently painted a dark gray she was already showing rust on her plates because there had been so much rain this winter . Not that the rivermen complained about these icy deluges ; operations along the Upper Mississippi and its twenty or more navigable tributaries were strictly limited by the stage of the waters . Come a sudden fall and an inexperienced pilot might leave a powerful gunboat indefinitely imprisoned in some backwater or bend from which she might emerge only when the ever-capricious waters rose again . Hence rain was no enemy to rivermen . As Paul Dent had ascertained shortly after reaching Cairo , low water was generally to be expected at two periods of the year : in the dead of winter when ice formed and choked that all-important flow from the tributaries , and again in midsummer when the blazing Middle Western sun dried up countless creeks and lesser streams . Small wonder that among those who wrung a hard living from the rivers , a licensed pilot stood in lordly isolation at the top of the social and economic ladder ; a " close-fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month and found . On his infinitelydetailed knowledge of currents and the exact locations of reefs , mud banks and a multitude of snags and wrecks , depended the very life of those imposing , but weakly constructed , steamboats which , until last summer , had plied that vast network of rivers opening up the West and Northwest Territories . Not yet had the remorseless tentacles of thep150railroads extended their trackage sufficiently to offer steamboat owners more than nuisance competition . It was in Cairo 's least noxious bars and hotels that numerous out-ofworkpilots congregated to talk politics , fight , drink and curse the Federal Government for offering the humiliating pittance of two hundred and fifty a month to licensed senior pilots ! Dent often proceeded to such a rendezvous to sit and listen , once his day 's work as a draftsman was done . Should he tonight patronize the Mudcat Bar or the Bald Eagle Tavern ? Standing on the bottom of an inverted scow , Dent deliberated the question . Because of Cairo 's miserable situation and vulnerability to sudden flooding many houses and cabins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , barges or ancient keelboats . For that matter the United States Naval Station here was in reality a floating town in which Captain A. M. Pennock , U.S.N. , toiled doggedly and successfully to arm and man Jim Eads ' homely ironclads . Locally they had become known as Sam Pook 's turtles  --  after the Eastern engineer who had designed them . On this raw afternoon of January 29 , 1862 , no less than four of James B. Eads ' gunboats lay at Cairo , alike as matches from the same box except for differently colored bands of paint decorating their smokestacks . All of them mounted thirteen rifled guns and had their low and too lightly armored pilothouses mounted just forward of the funnels  --  a Pook innovation since the typical river steamboat almost invariably carried her " texas " aft of her smokestacks . Each carried four small boats slung to davits located just forward of a great sternwheel which , theoretically at least , was protected from shot and shell by a housing of boiler iron . Like Commander Henry J. Walke , U.S.N. , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given to sketching whatever might challenge his interest . On impulse he pulled from his back pocket a sketchpad and commenced a swift rendering of the U.S. Army Gunboat Carondelet  --  chiefly because she lay nearest at hand and in a good light . She was charging ammunition and supplies and a swarm of black laborers were chanting as they lugged aboard powder chests and cases of shot . Awaiting its turn alongside lay a coal flat , low in the water , under a mound of coal in bushel baskets  --  the standard of measure on western rivers . Apparently St. Louis and her sister ships Mound City and Pittsburgh as well as Cincinnati , Andy Foote 's present flag steamer , had completed charging . These , the most powerful units in local waters , Dent deduced , must constitute the Federal main line of battle . Certainly a major campaign must be projected in the near future , otherwise why had taciturn Brigadier-General U.S. Grant and his staff come over thep151Ohio from Paducah to spend long hours in conference with Flag Officer Foote aboard Cincinnati ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive orders to naval officers commanding these gunboats , even if Army-owned . Seated upon a worn-out punt , Dent guided his pencil 's point so deftly that soon Carondelet assumed form and detail . With her design and interior plan Dent was entirely familiar through shamelessly having curried favor with her assistant pilot , Mr. Daniel Weaver , a whimsical , slowspokenTennessean who , for some reason , appreciated the Yale man 's rapt interest in the esoteric art of piloting . In fact that jolly individual had gone out of his way to encourage and befriend this dark and lonely man with the haunted eyes . A small sigh escaped the sketcher . What foul luck that his contract with Callahan and Grogan must run another week to completion ! Until then , he could not , in all honesty , volunteer for service in the Navy . Even out here he was resolved not to attempt enlistment in any of those regimentswhich nowadays came swarming down from Wisconsin , Illinois and Ohio to swell the Blue Armies of the West . A stiff gust of wind off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put away his sketchbook . Later he intended to draw two spans of magnificent oxen laboriously hauling a mud sled bearing a heavy sixtyfourrifle gun towards the river 's edge . Apparently this piece of ordnance was intended to arm Benton , an incredibly ugly ship-of-war recently arrivedfrom St. Louis . When he stepped into raw yellow mud in order to retrieve his hat he discovered that this mire had been churned so long by incessent traffic that he was forced to struggle hard each time he freed a foot . A sudden sound of band music , briskly played , attracted his attention to a familiar scene . From a crude , temporary railway station built on high ground was descending yet another column of infantry in dark blue overcoats . Sight of the National Colors indicated the presence of a whole regiment , but if one counted the generous number of such standards alreadyfluttering down on the levee few regiments could have numbered more than two or three hundred effectives . Waiting to receive these newly arrived units lay the faded-looking Kate Cassel , one of innumerable river boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little else to do until it came time to consumea wretched supper at some tavern , Paul Dent slogged down to watch the troops file aboard . They wore rakish kepis and white cross-belts over warm overcoats equipped with red-lined capes . These tall Middle Westerners of the 12th Illinois Volunteers splashed along in a columnp152of twos carrying single-shot , long-barrelled Springfield rifles . They were further equipped with a slender French-type bayonet slung over the left hip , a round blue canteen over the right and a patent-leather cartridge box between them . As they squelched down towards the Kate Cassel they began to sing and shout as if embarking on a summer excursion . A majority of them were big young fellows walking in that shambling , loose-kneed fashion which suggested that they had recently been recruited off some farm . A tightening sensation manifested itself in Dent 's stomach and his eyes filled . Except for a handful , most of these youths could not yet have seen their twentieth birthday . How pitifully inadequate they appeared under those tall packs , full-skirted overcoats and long-barrelled rifles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that blistering march down into Virginia last year . As usual a pack of mascot dogs cavorted about the muddied legs of their masters . When he noticed a lanky youth of seventeen trudging by singing " BuffaloGals " at the top of his lungs and lugging an umbrella under one arm , Dent had to turn aside a quivering face . How little did that lad and his companion realize what lay ahead : the deadly whine of minie balls , the eerie screech of passing shells , the awful , stunning crash of their explosion and the resultant screams and cries of agony . They , too , were to hear the bewildered and hysterical shouting of inexperienced officers and the futile cursing of noncoms who only wore their stripes because of popularity . Across this coffee-colored river , in Kentucky and further down in Tennessee , they 'd learn what a bursting shell could accomplish , in an instant , in the way of blinding , maiming , killing or , even worse , of dooming some previously healthy young fellow to the life of a querulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City we 're on our way ! " chanted the 12th Illinois Volunteers though they appeared disappointed that none of Cairo 's townsfolk had turned out to speed them on their way except a black-clad pastor who , with his wife and half-grown daughters , stood on a pile of lumber to wave little Union flags . The clergyman kept calling out endlessly , " God bless you , boys ! Be strong and keep pure in your fight for the Right . " Two by two , the muddied infantrymen squelched down the slope towards the Kate Cassel 's landing stage . Many , obviously from inland , stared in wide-eyed curiosity upon the transport as she lay with huge side wheel turning very slowly and her funnels raising twin columns of sooty smoke . A little distance out on the Ohio another transport , the Altona , kept backing her paddlewheels while waiting her turn at the wharf . Anotherp153regiment , the 15th Wisconsin , singing beautifully in German , appeared on the bluff and commenced to file past the bloated carcass of a mule which had become mired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit , swinging smartly along under fixed bayonets , started down towards the river after their fat little colonel who , for all the world , resembled nothing so much as a mallard drake improbably garbed in blue with brass buttons ; the scarlet lining of his overcoat 's cape kept flaring in a wind off the river . " Keep step , poys , and hold your heads up , " he called over a rattle of drums and and the shrilling of fifes . " Py Gott , I vant this burg should the Fifteenth Visconsin remember . " Suddenly a shaft of light from the setting sun broke through and drew a ripple of red sparks from the bayonet points . A pair of naval officers on their way to mess commented , " Poor bastards ! Imagine trying to keep step in this muck . Wait till they set foot in Kentucky and see what quagmires pass for roads over yonder . " The rasping bark of a sergeant drilling some men on a comparatively dry piece of ground attracted Dent 's attention . He wandered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rawest-appearing recruits he had ever beheld . They were shaggy , dirty and undoubtedly the culls of some regiment raised in the farm country . " Right , turn ! " roared the red-faced sergeant . Half of the awkward squad promptly turned left . " God Almighty ! That ai n't right ! That 's left  --  like I told you fifty times ! What have I done that I should be condemned to drill a bunch of dim-witted club-footed twerps like you ? Johnson , " he said , " raise your right arm . " A gangling , buck-toothed youth hesitated , then raised his left arm . " Jesus Christ ! " Wildly the sergeant looked about , then his gaze fell upon a mound of supplies protected by a tarpaulin . " Stand where you are or I 'll skin you alive ! " he snarled and went striding over to a pile of baled straw . From it he ripped a double handful of straw , then swung over to a pile of hay . He passed along the line of recruits . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I reckon you can tell hay from straw . Here ! Put that straw in your right boot  --  yes , that one ! Put some hay in your left boot . " While Dent looked on convulsed in silent laughter , the recruits did as they were bidden . " Now ! " said the sergeant , " when I say Forward march ! ' you start off with your hay foot . Understand ? " Delighted smiles shone along the rank . " Now then  --  hay foot  --  straw foot  --  hay foot  --  straw foot ! " A passing soldier added , " And belLy full of rot gut ! "  | " Sing it , you bastards ! Sing it ! " Grinning delightedly , the recruits moved off singing , " Hay foot  --  straw foot  --  belly full of rot-gut . " The drill sergeant shrugged , removed his kepi and sighed his relief . After attending evensong in a ramshackle chapel where he prayed long and earnestly for strength and the courage to redeem himself , Paul Dent picked his way across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharf . Having no desire to return to the construction gang 's barracks ' stuffy air and foul , generally witless , conversation , he picked a course between lofty piles of supplies awaiting transportation to wherever General Halleck decreed they should go . On obtaining a clear view of the river Dent 's attention was attracted to a small , black-painted sternwheeler apparently inbound from the Mississippi . She had commenced to whistle for roustabouts who presently came slouching out from various saloons and eating houses . Seated comfortably enough upon a pile of tents , Dent pulled out his sketchpad again and , despite gathering darkness , quickly recorded an impression of this swift-appearing sternwheeler now threshing importantly towards the shore . Bluish wood smoke streamed from jagged sheet-iron crowns capping her smoke pipes and curled about the spreader bars joiningthem . Presently the draftsman was able to distinguish that this freighter carried a deckload of forage wagons and that a number of mules were waving long ears on her foredeck . Of course the inevitable blue-clad figures lounged about the hurricane or topmost deck or had perched upon the freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrow painted in gold letters around her texas . Expertly her pilot guided his craft around a big floe of ice building up about a drifting tree . To continual strident screams from her whistle and a mad clanging of bells the steamboat was urged gently up to the wharf , then lines were sent snaking ashore to be made fast by roustabouts . Presently the new arrival 's tackles screeched and a broad , sturdily-constructed landing stage was lowered onto the wharf 's splintered surface . Apparently the Western Arrow 's captain was in no great hurry to departfrom Cairo . for at once his engineer blew off steam in great thuttering blasts , then smoke eddied in diminished quantities from the chimneys . In leisurely fashion a crew of ragged Negroes coaxed or hauled ashore the mules , then manhandled seven or eight forage wagons across the landing stage . Finally , a half company of grinning and gawping infantry straggled ashore lugging their packs and muskets any whichway . Darkness had set in by the time the last bales and cases consigned forp155Cairo had been toted into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing Dora , I kin sing hit fine , I kin sing Dora , Well as Coonjintin ' Jine , " " Run here , dog , and git yo ' bone , " or " Show me which shoulder to lay it on . " Somewhat stiffly because of a cold wind which had begun to blow , Paul Dent put away his sketch , descended from his perch and wandered over to inspect the Western Arrow now taking on cordwood from a flatboatthat was poled alongside . Just as he reached the freighter 's side a tall figure elegant in a bottle-green greatcoat and a glossy , stovepipe hat descendeda staircase and started across the emptied foredeck and into the glare created by pine knots flaring in a pair of iron torch baskets . Dent started , called out , " Is that really you , Matt Everett ? " " Sure is . " Grinning , the big figure hurried forward with hand outstretched . " Thought it was you , Paul . Saw you from the wheelhouse . ' What wonderful luck ! Wait here , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Quartermaster 's office . Wo n't be gone a minute . " He returned promptly , plainly eager to renew their acquaintance , and invited his friend aboard the Western Arrow . In patent pride he showed Dent about ; to the engine room where the machinery glistened and boilers hissed softly . " This is Tim O'Hara , " said he , " the hottest damn ' engineer on the River . He can get up steam in two shakes of a lamb 's tail . Tell Mr. Dent about our engines , Tim . " That burly , gap-toothed individual complied without hesitation and at length . " Now these here are the pilot 's signal bells  --  this here 's the reversing gear , there 's the steam drum and that 's the cam-gear rod . This here 's the poppet valve and that 's the relief , or safety valve . " He moved about the hot , lantern-lit engine room his dirty red flannel shirt aglow . " Now these here are two mighty fine engines , built last year up to Cincinnati . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds to the square inch and are non-condensers . In each o ' my four boilers are four two-inch flues . With this here lever I can send escape steam up the chimneys to blow out soot and to increase the draft . " He patted one of the boilers . " Stout cast-iron , mister , so we do n't fear blowing out a boiler head . Yonder cylinders are thirty-inch diameter and have a ten-inch stroke . It can drive . " He showed a gold tooth in a wide grin . " Yessir , if Cap'n Everett here says the word I can drive this boat upstream at better'n eight mile an hour on an average stage of water , or twelve downriver . " He winked . " Which , in our business comes in mighty useful sometimes . "  |p156At  length Matt , heavier of build and older-looking than the man Dent had encountered on the train , broke in . " Guess you 've confused Mr. Dent enough , Tim . Sure you 've got plenty of wood ? We 'll likely have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to cord upon cord of wood stacked around the engines . " Come along , Paul , let 's slip up to my cabin and I 'll treat you to a shot of prime old red-eye . " " Quite a cabin you have here , " Dent presently observed while savoring a glass of red-brown bourbon that tasted as good as it looked . The Connecticutersettled himself upon a deep armchair upholstered in brown corduroy and quite openly inspected Matt 's quarters . The first thing he noted was a terra-cotta figurine of a voluptuously modelled nymph wearing a fetching smile and nothing else . To the walls were hung prints of such famous steamboats as the Eclipse , the New Uncle Sam and the ill-fated Pennsylvania aboard which two hundred personshad lost their lives when she blew up in 1859 . Obviously several staterooms must have been consolidated to form this single spacious cabin furnished in the usual lavish style of a Western steamboat . Kerosenelamps in bright brass gimbals boasted hand-painted shades of frosted glass and a light green carpet was both deep and lustrous . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , occupied one end of Matt 's quarters . A washstand , two deep armchairs , a wide sofa and several hassocks completedthe furniture , but that which especially attracted Dent 's attention was the pair of frilly and gaily decorated ladies ' garters which had been slung over one of the bedposts . " The Western Arrow 's no beauty , " Everett was saying , " but she 's sound and new and , best of all , she draws only sixteen inches and can go like a scared cat when it 's necessary . And , as Tim said , just now speed is sometimes damn ' necessary for us . " His friend , Dent was deciding , certainly had filled out and his yellowblondside whiskers had become considerably more than the promise they had been on the train . Undoubtedly he had prospered if that heavy chain of what appeared to be real gold , traversing an elegant waistcoat of redand-yellowbrocade , was any indication . On a hand which no longer looked chapped or rough sparkled a diamond as large as the pearl securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly built deserter , from mud-caked , knee-high boots to heavy black duroy trousers , navy blue flannelshirt and a heavy serge jacket . Dent 's long and sensitive features appeared weather-beaten and somewhat thinner than of yore , which emphasizedthe fine modelling of his rather wide jaw , straight , thin nosep157and broad forehead . His blue eyes , however , had lost a certain furtive aspect which had been quite noticeable some weeks earlier . " Well , you certainly seem to have done mighty well for yourself , Matt , " Dent observed accepting a seegar from a handsome calfskin case trimmed in gold . " You could n't have stuck very long under Callahan 's contract . " " No , I did n't and that 's a fact . " Matt sent a cloud of seegar smoke whirling over to soar up from the lamp chimney . " I bought up my contractwithin a short time . You should have done the same " " I did n't have that kind of money , " the Yale man explained simply , but did not add that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary funds . After all , Jim Eads ' gunboats had needed to be armed and outfitted . Suppose everyone had bought up his contract ? Then Carondelet and her sister ships would not now be ready to support the impending Federal campaign into western Kentucky nor could they meet , if necessary , the threat presented by the existence of the powerful Confederate flotilla reported to be concentrating in the vicinity of Memphis . No one knew much about this flotilla except that daily it was being augmented under the command of some of the ablest officers ever to graduate from Annapolis . A small sigh escaped the host as he raised his glass to squint at the rich , mahogany-hued bourbon it contained . " Paul , since we parted I'veoften thought about you  --  and me  --  and I 'm sorry to see you in no better I case than you seem to be . So long as you have n't re-enlisted , I 'd like to see you do better for yourself . Would you like to come along with me in the Western Arrow ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands cupped about his glass . " You 'd be wise to , because there are fortunes , great fortunes , to be made by the use of ordinary shrewdness and foresight . Look at me . Since I last saw you towards the end of November I 've rid myself of a pack of damn ' fool idealistic notions . Then I 'd just over three hundred dollars capital . Today I 'm half owner of this steamer and am about to buy one of my own  --  the North Star . " When feet tramped along the main deck 's passagewayhe lowered his voice . " I 've ten thousand salted away in the bank and I own a warehouse and wharf in St. Louis . If all goes as well with this trip as I expect , I 'll clear forty thousand dollars . Think of that ! " " But you have completed your trip , " Dent commented through a haze of tobacco smoke . " Or have n't you ? " " Not by a jugful , " returned the New Englander . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck ? Why did you suppose we did n't shove off as soon as I 'd unloaded ? " " I was wondering about that . " " Well , it 's because now that I 'm rid of those heroes in blue and theirp158wagons and jackasses , around midnight I 'm heading back out into the Mississippi , " he paused , " then my pilot will head south  --  not north . " Dent put down his glass . " But , Matt , how can you steer south ? The Rebels have forts at Columbus , Belmont and not to mention a great fort on Island Number Ten . " Matt took a sip of his whiskey and settled back intently eyeing his friend . " I have here on board a very useful gentleman , " he confided , " an associate who knows just when and where to show blue and red lights arranged in a certain order . They will prevent either a Federal or a Rebel battery from opening fire upon the Western Arrow . Sometime tomorrow I will put into Columbus for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped and his long features suddenly contracted themselves . " Do you really intend to trade with the enemy ? " " Most assuredly I 'll trade with certain Southern merchants . You 've no notion the prices they 'll pay for such items as medicines , percussion caps , boots and shoes . Anyone in this er  --  business , who does n't make a three hundred percent profit is a great ninny . Paul , " said he earnestly , " I 'm offering you a job aboard this boat and a chance to coin money hand over fist . " " Thanks , but I 'd rather not . " Matt flushed and his mouth hardened . " Do n't be so damned quick about turning me down . Wo n't you face facts ? Way you 're headed you 'll have never a dollar to show when this lovely war 's ended . More likely you 'll wind up with a bullet through your guts . " Quietly Paul Dent got to his feet , stood looking down at the powerful figure across the stateroom . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thank you for your well-intentioned offer , but as it is , MatthewEverett , I can only pity you  --  and bid you good night . " JUST BEFORE DAWN on February z , 1862 , Daniel Weaver , Second Pilot on the U.S. Army Gunboat Carondelet , thrust a hand into Paul Dent 's bunk and prodded the Connecticuter into a groggy state of consciousness . " Rouse up , " he instructed quietly , " and come with me . " At once Dent pulled on mud-caked boots which , despite the thick wool socks he had worn to bed , felt stiff and clammy . Puzzled , he followed Weaver 's short , plump figure over to the dining shack in which a quartet of black cooksp159sleepily were preparing the workers ' usual breakfast of eggs , fried potatoes , bacon , ham and coffee strong enough to drive a rivet . " What 's up ? " yawned the draftsman . Gleams of excitement shone in Weaver 's jet eyes and the Indian-like pilot 's thin mouth was a tight line . " You 've allus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's entirely correct . Do you really mean it ? " Dent burst out . " Do you ? " " Well , Ed Barnsby  --  me and Billy Hinton 's relief pilot  --  claims he 's got real bad bellyache cramps that wo n't let up . " Weaver sniffed . " I reckon them cramps is the kind some folks get when there 's fighting ahead . I ca n't bear a coward . Can you ? " Paul Dent winced . " I 've no respect for such . Did you say there 's to be some fighting soon ? " " Yep . Old man Foote 's hull damned flotilla 's due to shove off this mornin ' account of that there Gen'ral Grant who came visitin ' here last week is fixin ' to tackle a big fort the Rebs have built somewheres up the Tennessee River . " Fighting ! Small , icy shivers commenced to course down Paul Dent 's spine and his throat contracted convulsively once or twice  --  just as it had that awful summer 's day at Bull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Billy Hinton and me have ranged all Cairo and there 's not a cub pilot available what with the Army chartering so many transports and manning their gunboats .

" " But  --  but what about my Callahan and Grogan contract ? It 's got a week to run . " Despite everything he now found himself fervently hoping that by this excuse he might avoid acceptance of the Second Pilot 's invitation . " Oh , do n't you worry none ' bout that , " the other returned while acceptinga tin cup of steaming coffee from a grinning Negro . " Billy Hinton already dropped a word to Grogan and he says he wo n't object to yer quittin ' early , says your work at Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped the Connecticuter . " Oh , did he ? " Daniel Weaver 's little black eyes narrowed suddenly . " Well , what about it ? Thought you was mustard-keen to handle a gunboat 's wheel and to get in some licks ' gainst the Rebs . " " Oh , I am , I am , make no mistake about that ! " The words came outp160with a rush lest his mounting fears choke them off . " When do I report and where ? " " Now you 're talking more like it , " Daniel Weaver offered him a small brown hand . " Just throw your gear into a bag and show up on Number Two landing inside a half hour . " He grinned . " Me and Billy have talked things over and I do n't figure you 'll get rattled or scared in a pinch . Billy ai n't so sure , but he 's willin ' to try you . " His Adam 's apple worked twice , thrice ere he finished his coffee , then he wiped his mouth on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you dast be late . Cap'n Walke 's a stickler for discipline , for all he 's a funny feller and likes to draw pitchers , same 's you . " Amid blinding rain more violent than any that Dent had hitherto witnessedeven in soggy , mildewed Cairo , Flag Officer Foote 's flotilla got under way and left behind the Naval Station 's receiving ship Maria Denning , the muddied walks , ramshackle barracks , warehouses and floating armories . His command consisted of four Eads-built gunboats , the largest of which , and the slowest , was Essex under command of Lieutenant William D. Porter , U.S.N. ; Carondelet , commanded by Commander Henry Walke , U.S.N. ; St. Louis , Lieutenant Leonard Paulding , U.S.N. ; and Cincinnati , the flag steamer , her commander Lieutenant R. N. Stembel , U.S.N.In company with these ugly , turtle-like craft steamed those ungainly but very useful timberclads , Tyler , Lexington and Conestoga . All the gunboatsraised clouds of sooty black smoke which instantly were snatched away by a bitter wind lashing the Ohio 's turgid waters into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-too-thinly-plated wheelhouse Paul Dent could see flags flown by the other vessels standing from their staffs stiff as though cut out of cardboard . He saw a puff of steam escape from Cincinnati 's whistle whereupon Chief Pilot Hinton pulled a cord swinging to the right of his head . Bells jangled deep in Carondelet 's bowels as her Chief Engineer , William H. , Faulkner , eased open his throttles and set the ironclad 's ponderous stern wheel to threshing more rapidly . For the first time both Chief Pilot Hinton and his assistant , Daniel Weaver , had donned uniforms which were similar to those of an Army officer , but their gold-rimmed black velvet straps were blank , devoid of insignia of rank . Indeed , a contract pilot occupied a painfully anomalous position . Although legally civilian these individuals nonetheless were subject to Army discipline . However , they exercised no authority beyond thatp161necessary safely to pilot the Union 's gunboats through treacherous channels , chutes and bends . Commander Henry Walke stood slightly forward of the wheel with hands tucked for warmth under the coattails of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pilothouse 's forward side . Under bushy , wide eyebrows Henry Walke had shrewd , penetrating gray eyes . He was tall , thin and clean-shaven save for the sparse chin whiskers typical of a New England farmer and his hair receded almost half the length of his cranium . As became an officer of the Regular Navy he held himself ramrod-straight except when he took to sketching  --  apastime he indulged whenever opportunity offered . " Why would they assign me the slowest of these damned floating barns of Eads ' ? " Dent heard Walke growl . " Confounded scow ca n't turn up better than seven knots , no matter how the draughts are forced . " Along the willow-crowned bluffs above Cairo had collected a dark throng of laborers , mechanics and townsfolk come to bid farewell to these grim ironclads on which they had labored so long . From the direction of Camp Defiance , situated upon a peninsula dominating the confluence of the Ohio and the Mississippi Rivers , sounded the faint thud of salutes beingfired . Time and again lashing rain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as that vessel 's fabric commenced to vibrateunder increased impulses from her engines . From the exhaust pipes sounded an unending series of staccato , cracking reports characteristic of almost every steamboat navigating western waters . In time with the splashings of the great sternwheel Chief Pilot William Hinton 's gray-whiskered jaws commenced to work upon a chew of tobaccowhile expertly he whirled the six-foot wheel guiding this ungainly ironclad into the Ohio 's main channel . From below sounded a rumbling of gun carriage wheels handled in practice by crews of hard-bitten seamen out of the Regular Navy . Carondelet 's First , Second , Third and Fourth Masters , all civilians , were busy superintending the shifting of gear and ammunition to satisfy Chief Engineer Faulkner , that worthy having insisted that Carondelet must float on an absolutely even keel ; he 'd be damned if he 'd tolerate a list which might leave certain boiler tubes so short of water that they could burn out or blow up when too much steam was developed in them . Relentlessly , rain came beating in through eye-slits let into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the better to deflect shot and musket balls . Soon a regular gale sprang up and set Carondelet 's four small boats to rocking slowly from their davits . Bigp162chunks of ice and even an occasional floe came drifting downstream , but these were not heavy enough to constitute a hazard . " Must be one hell of a big rise some'eres , " commented Weaver when a huge tree went drifting by and caused the Essex 's pilot to swerve sharply . By afternoon the Union flotilla , on its course towards the entrance to the Tennessee River , had become strung out in a straggling column nearly a mile in length . Around three the rain let up sufficiently to permit all manner of floating debris and snags to become clearly visible . Only then did the Indian-like Assistant Pilot beckon Dent . " Now , Paul , just you keep our jackstaff in line with the St. Louis ' wheelhouse like I said t' other day . That jackstaff ai n't been put there just to fly pennons and flags ; she 's more of a front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap with a battered patent-leather peak back on his head , Dent stepped up onto a grating traversed by a series of cleats designed to assure a pilot secure footing when there was need to cramp over the wheel in a hurry . He nodded , gripped the wheel handles and experienced a lifting sensation at this assumption of control over the ironclad . For a little while he experimented until he could gauge the exact pressure necessary to turn Carondelet and gradually got the " feel " of the vessel 's four rudders  --  sternwheelers necessarily were so equipped . Commander Walke long ago had disappeared below to watch his gun crews at loading and firing practice . By now even the newest member of the civilian engine room crew had learned that Carondelet 's First Division armament consisted of two old forty-two pound rifled guns which could throw shells of eighty-four pounds weight , and an ancient sixty-four pounder , all three mounted to fire ahead . Her Second Division , or broadside batteries , were composed of four guns each : two rifled forty-two pounders , two sixty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Third Division or stern battery , consisted merely of two light thirty-two pound smoothbores . Of the thirteen guns aboard , at least six could hurl shot and shell better than two miles  --  and with extraordinary precision when handled by such veterans as were now sweating and cursing below . No matter how diligently the stokers fed her fireboxes Carondeletshealways had been slightly slower than the other Eads-built ships  --  could not do better than five knots upstream . Dent strained his eyes upstream . It seemed as if every passing minute brought more and more debris down the storm-lashed Ohio . He was more than ready to surrender the wheel towards dusk . " Yep . There 's a flood stage up the Tennessee or I 'm a Dutchman , " Weaver grunted . Flotsam of all description came so thick and fast thatp163now it could not be completely avoided . Because Carondelet 's freeboardwas less than three feet , branches and small snags presently commenced to ride up over her prow and lodge themselves on the gunboat 's foredeck . Finally night closed in and proved so dark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lee of the Ohio 's northern bank and there anchor for the night . In the gray of the next day 's dawn , bugles blew and bells clanged briskly aboard the Union flotilla , augmented now by a scattering of coal boats and several river steamers converted into Army transports . As daylightbroadened , Carondelet 's crew made out the half-submerged and muddied wreckage of a steamboat lying not two hundred yards distant . She evidently had broken her back on a sandbar . One of the Henry J. Cass ' smokestacks had fallen and lay like a rusty log across her hurricane deck , but the other still rose forlornly above the surface . " We 'll be seein ' plenty of wrecks , but not all of ' em show much above the surface ; that 's one thing you 'll have to watch out sharp for , " Weaver predicted as he appeared in the pilothouse showing a splash of egg on his bushy black beard . " Ai n't all of ' em shows even something above water , specially when the river 's in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you can see is an eddy or boil with streamers behind it  --  like that one yonder . " The pilot pulled a plug of tobacco from his back pocket , cut off a chew with his clasp knife and with meticulous attention studied the turbulent entrance to the Tennessee . " Nope . Ai n't much changed from last year , " he grunted . " Now , Paul , I 'll sing out the marks to steer by and you memorize them . Take the wheel and make for the inside of that next bend  --  closer in than Sam MacBride is takin ' the St. Louis . Always remember this . A pilot travelling downstream holds to the outside o ' the bend where he can profit best from the depth and current but steaming upstream cramp over to the inner shore and you 'll find slack water as a rule . And remember this , too , goin ' upstream you can weave , ' as we call it , back and forth across the channel in a counter-direction  --  this will save wear and fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In growing confidence Paul Dent steered with his jackstaff lined up on " the mark , " an outcrop of rock . " Lucky the river 's deep here so we do n't need to get out the lead lines or sounding poles . There ! " he exclaimed . " Feel that ? " " Yes . The boat seemed to slow up for a minute . " " She did . We passed over a shallow place and it dragged ' at our bottom  --  no , we did n't touch , so relax . " Weaver spat through an eye-slit . " Better ring the engine room for a better head of steam . We 're droppin ' back from the Cincinnati . "  |p164That  the rest of the flotilla , too , was firing up to fight the furious currentwas attested by dense clouds of black coal smoke beginning to rise vertically through the drizzle . Presently Commander Walke appeared in company with Chief Pilot Hinton . Walke 's craggy brows merged into a single line . " Devilish lot of debris out there  --  more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence , privies , water-logged small boats and , most threatening of all , whole trees which , having stood on a bank undermined by the current , had tumbledinto the river . " Cuss it ! " growled Weaver when the Chief Pilot took over , " yonder 's the makin 's of a heap o ' sawyers and deadheads . " At Dent 's puzzled expression he explained in an undertone , " A deadheadis nawthin ' but a log lodged just fur enough below the surface so 's you ca n't spy it in a bad light . A big enough deadhead will stove in a steamboat 's bottom or smash her paddle buckets quicker'n a deck hand will grab a whiskey bottle . But it 's a sawyer that will do the worst damage . " " Sawyer ? " " Yep . See yonder oak tree floatin ' by ? Notice how its top points downstream ? That 's because there 's still a lot of clay and stones still clinging to its roots . Comes the moment when the current do n't move that tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally after most of the branches have been broken off . Damned thing a'ways settles so 's its roots dig into the river bottom and its top points downstream . " Keeping an eye on the naval officer , Weaver silently , accurately spat out of an eye-slit , then returned to his discourse . " Well , that old log 's all right so long as the river 's low and you can sight him , but when the water 's high and fast like now , there 's no tellin ' where such a damn ' thing lies . Worst of it is that-there hidden log keeps a-sawin ' back and forth , mebbe twenty degrees . If a pilot 's luck is out , that-there sawyer will punch right through his boat 's bottom and plenty of times ram clean through to the engine room and cause the boilers to blow up . " " But how can you tell if there 's a sawyer ahead ? " " You ca n't always tell , but mebbe if it 's rot too rough there 'll be a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his attention attracted to Cincinnati . A blue-and-white checkered flag was rising to her signal mast situated directly forward of her stern wheel 's housing . " Looks like old Andy Foote aims to get this column to close up . " A dense flock of mallards came winging downstream . " Keerist ! Wisht I had me a shotgun . Them birds is damn ' sight better'n eating that sowbellyand beans we got for break  --  " " Look ! " Dent cried suddenly . " Over on the east bank ! "  | " What do you see ? " Commander Walke called sharply and snatched up binoculars he carried slung about his long neck . " Sir , there 's a party of horsemen looking at us . " Immediately Carondelet 's commander trained his field glasses . " You 're right . That 's cavalry and Rebel cavalry , too . Look at ' em go ! Guess they 're headed for their nearest semaphore station . " Quite clearly Dent could discern the brown-clad riders , six or eight of them , as they spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralleled the Tennessee . Undoubtedly Brigadier-General Lloyd Tilghman , commanding at Fort Henry , would soon be apprised that a powerful Union flotilla was steaming to attack him . Walke strode over to where Dent sat , with a sketchpad balanced on knee , sharpening a pencil . He viewed the slender , dark-haired young man with interest . " What 's your name , mister ? " " Dent , sir . Paul Dent . " " You are a licensed pilot ? We 're only supposed to have two aboard . " " No , sir . I 'm only an apprentice of Mr. Weaver 's . " " Well , Mr. Dent , I 'll say you 've uncommon good eyesight . Nobody else noticed those Rebel scouts . " He nodded at the sketchpad . " I see you 're partial to sketching also . " " Yes , sir . Thought those other gunboats trailing their smoke downstreamwere worth an impression . " Henry Walke 's long and craggy yet subtly humorous features relaxed their customary critical aspect . " Good enough . Come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started to turn away , then checked himself and addressed Weaver . " Good idea that , of bringing aboard an apprentice  --  teach him your trade as fast as you can . " His smile faded . " Every time I look at that silly , quarter-inch armor they 've put on this pilothouse I get the notion that things are going to get damnably messy in here if ever Rebel batteries find our range . " ON THE FOURTH of February , 1862 , Flag Officer Foote 's flotilla dropped anchors some six miles below the Confederate stronghold known as Fort Henry . On the fifth , Essex , while on reconnaissance duty , ventured too near the enemy 's earthworks and so was struck by a solid shot which crashed through her pantry , shattered the port officers ' quarters and finally came to lodge in the former snag boat 's steerage . Incredibly , not a singlep166person was hurt so the ungainly craft churned back to her anchorage proud of having fired the first shots at the enemy and of having sustained the first damage  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on repairs . Next day , while the gunboats , under the pressure of flood waters , sawed and tugged savagely at their anchors and while their crews frequently cleared away debris that kept on riding up on the gunboats ' low bows , Flag Officer Foote ordered out his barge and had himself rowed from one vessel to the next . Paul Dent would always remember the thrill he experiencedwhen that stumpy individual with the grizzled hair and beard and piercing blue eyes came stalking over Carondelet 's stern deck to be received by Commander Walke , erect and very spruce in a doublebreastedcoat bearing two rows of gold buttons , gold sleeve braid and goldtrimmedshoulder straps . Gravely , the frosty old man handled his sword and saluted the big Stars and Stripes snapping smartly in an icy wind , then stepped through a stern gunport into the semi-darkness of the casemate where , in geometric patterns , naval officers and seamen waited at rigid attention beside their guns . Carondelet 's civilian complement of stokers , oilers , engineers and pilots , meanwhile stood in a silent cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable in his shapeless civilian clothes . In a silence disturbed only by the lazy hiss of steam from Carondelet 's escape valves and the dull bump-bumping of flotsam along her hull , Andrew Hull Foote 's heels clicked briskly across the gun deck . The Navy gun crews , mostly mature men wearing full beards , stood rigid in neat , dark blue uniforms . Light was admitted only through half a dozen gunports , the lid covers of which had been hoisted to afford ventilation for , whenever all were closed , it became insufferably hot within the casematedespite the presence of a quartet of iron ventilators badly mounted just forward of the ironclad 's paddlewheel box . Not a speck of mud , not a chip , not even a thread marred the gun deck 's spotlessness . Even the long , brown-black tubes of Carondelet 's guns shone dully . Every article of brass glistened , every tackle rope had been neatly coiled , every ammunition locker was full and opened for inspection . Twice Foote paused to address some petty officer remembered from earlier service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Flag Officer halted just forward of Number Two gun and whipped off his flat-topped , straight-visored officer 's cap . He tucked it under his left arm . " Men , " said he , " I am about to invite you to join in a brief supplication to our Creator . " He joined his hands and , as the whole company followedp167his example , Foote cried , in earnest and reverent tones , that struck deep into Paul Dent 's soul , " Holy Father and Supreme Arbiter of our destinies , encourage us all that we may face the dangers which lie before us . Sustain us , we pray You , in the coming battle , make strong our hearts and so favor our cause that we may , without faltering , fight our best for this , our beloved Country and for that Union which was born of the suffering and courage of our forefathers . Amen . " During the afternoon even greater masses of tangled debris came whirlingdown the dark and foggy Tennessee presently to foul the Western Flotilla 's anchor chains and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Soon the gunboat 's bows became so weighted that water commenced to boil over their foredecks , whereupon their crews used axes to slash free these encumbrances . Despite use of both of her anchors Carondelet at length was forced to use her sternwheel at half speed to avoid being pushed downstream . Everyone aboard became mystified by a series of muffled reports , rather like that of a big gun being fired at varying distances upstream . What could the Rebels be up to ? Eyes wearied through an over-conscientious scrutiny of Sam Cummings ' The Western Navigator and a recent edition of The New River Guide by one George Conclin of Cincinnati , Paul Dent volunteered to join the work party . Theirs proved to be the laborious task of hacking , levering and sawing . " My God ! What 's that ? " A startled voice demanded from a small boat occupied on towing away a deadhead . Dent glanced down in time to watch a white , cylindrical object perhaps five feet long go whirling by parallel to the ironclad 's beam . A naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified oath . " My God ! That 's a torpedo ! If that thing hit us right it would have blown our whole damn ' bottom out ! " When he got a good look at this deadly engine a sickening sensation constricted Dent 's throat . The torpedo had been equipped with a hinged iron arm ending in two sharp prongs . These points were designed to lodge themselves in a boat 's wooden bottom and so activate the arm which , in turn , detonated a simple firing mechanism . Good God ! He had escaped death by a distance of three short feet . " So that 's what caused them explosions we been hearin'l " grunted a gunner . " Thought it did n't sound quite like cannon fire . " Through the fog Walke at once hailed his nearest consort to apprise her of this hidden menace . Before another fifteen minutes had passed another torpedo or floatingp168mine apparently uprooted by a small dead pinetree , appeared heading straight for Carondelet . The mine might well have sunk her had not the gunboat 's yawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunboat was visible amid this silvery mist Dent guessed that by now they , too , had sent out boat crews . Desperately he attempted to concentrate on the work in hand yet could not conquer a soul-withering fear that , at any instant , there might sound a deafening , deadly explosion ; trickles of sweat began coursing down his hack , soaking his shirt and drawers . " Damn ' good thing this river 's at flood . These here snags must have torn a heap of them Reb torpedoes from their moorings , " commented First Master Richard Wade . " But sure as shootin ' we 'll run onto some of them when we close in on the fort . " All night long the Connecticuter lay rigid , praying for courage , strained and sweating in a hammock slung just outside the wardroom . Every time some floating object went bumping , scraping along the gunboat 's length hairs on the back of his neck lifted . Through sheer exhaustion Dent eventually sank into a profound slumber from which he was aroused by an insistent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of gray light shone through the gunportsbut by it one could note that the fog had lifted , that the rain had ceased . February the sixth promised to prove a fine and cheerful winter 's day . Shortly after sunup a gig came pulling over from Cincinnati bearing a jaunty young naval lieutenant who promptly sought the Captain 's cabin . A seaman on guard outside of the door could hear Walke 's incisive voice snapping , " It goes without saying , mister , that I will do as the Flag Officer directs , but I must observe that this is the God-damndest manner of fighting gunboats I 've ever heard of . " Later it turned out that the cause of Henry Walke 's bitter complaint was certain of Officer Foote 's instructions . Because the river immediately below Fort Henry narrowed so greatly there would be small room for maneuver ; therefore Carondelet and St. Louis were to be lashed side-byside . " Which means , " explained Second Master John Dorety , " we 'll have to tackle the fort with only our bow guns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad an idea , " Chief Gunner Richard Adams observed . " Our armor 's thickest forward . I 'd hate like hell to risk my life behind that quarter-inch boiler iron we carry aft of the engine room . Cussed if I see why Eads did n't call for real armor on the pilothouse . That place is bound to become a slaughter pen ; every Rebel battery will try to hit it . "  |p169At  twenty minutes past ten Cincinnati hoisted a signal to get underway and so sent the Western Flotilla threshing laboriously upstream with its crews praying that no torpedoes would be encountered . It cast anchor again at Panther Island lying approximately two miles below Fort Henry , in a position sheltered from the raging currents . At eleven thirty-five of the morning the four ironclads steamed into a line abreast , with Essex on the extreme right , Cincinnati next to her , then Carondelet and St. Louis lashed firmly together . At a safe distance behind the Eads ironclads cruised those extremely vulnerable but very useful and swift timberclads , Tyler , Lexington and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " knew " this river in addition to the Ohio  --  Chief Pilot Hinton was more familiar with the Cumberland and Ohio  --  attempt to concert his vessel 's steering with that of St. Louis . Considerable shouting back and forth became necessary . Soon the Tennessee narrowed , hemmed in between high banks upon which dark hardwood forests advanced right to the water 's edge ; in fact several undermined trees hung canted crazily out over the furious , claycoloredwaters . Chiefly because Commander Walke , taut and observant , was present very little talk took place in the wheelhouse . In the casemate below , gun crews of the First or Forward Division stood at battle stations but offered obscene comment when civilian deck hands appeared and began scatteringsand upon the wheel-scarred decking lest feet slip on bloodied places . From Carondelet 's engine room sounded a continuous rasp and ring of coal shovels hard at work and the clang of fire doors being opened and shut . Soon various escape valves crackled louder than ever and great billowsof sooty smoke commenced to gush from the flotilla 's smokestacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a bend suddenly called out in a voice that was not as calm as usual , " Well , sir , there she be ; over yonder on the west bank . " " Yes . I see it . Thank God the forts are not on such high ground as I 'd feared . Urn . We 'll suffer from little or no plunging fire . " Gradually the yellow-red glacis of Fort Henry became more visible beneath a ship-rigged flagstaff from which flapped the Confederate ensign . At this distance it appeared all but undistinguishable from the Stars and Stripes  --  a circumstance which would ere long prove costly to both sides until the Stars and Bars with its readily distinguishable red field was evolved . ( Curiously , this banner under which the Confederacy fought for almost three years never was officially adopted by the Government at Richmond . ) As Commander Walke levelled his field glass a small muscle in his cheek commenced to work from time to time . Hinton , too , was anxious ,  |p170Dent  observed in some relief , while the four gray-black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparks from their smokestacks . Gradually embrasures in the red , raw earth of the various salients composing Fort Henry 's earthworks could be seen in greater detail . " The enemy are standing to their guns , sir , " First Master Wade called up a short , steep companionway leading down into the casemate . When the range had decreased to approximately a mile Dent distinctly heard the voices of the gun captains of the three bow guns  --  located immediatelybeneath his feet  --  order a correction in elevation . Still not a single shot was fired from the Confederate defenses ; Fort Henry might have been deserted for all visible activity . At length Commander Walke strode over to the companionway and called down into the casemate . " You will not open fire under any conditionsuntil the flagship fires  --  then fire at will and aim  --  " He got no further for from Cincinnati 's bow gushed a dazzling blast of flame and a cloud of gray-white smoke . Then the whole river resounded to a crashing , thunderous report . Instantly Paul Dent 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingertips commenced to grow numb , just as they had at Bull Run . Boom ! Booml Cincinnati 's two other bow guns were discharged . Then , as Dent clung to a stanchion and gulped for air , the whole deck quivered beneath his feet . With a deafening report , Carondelet 's sixty-four pound rifled gan had let fly and was followed in swift succession by the two forty-two pound rifles . Momentarily all view of the Tennessee and of the fort became concealed behind a whirling bellows of hot , choking and evil-smelling burnt powder . A fearful ear-shattering uproar ensued once Essex and St. Louis also opened fire . From below sounded the rumbling of Carondelet 's gun carriages being hauled back amid excited curses and panted commands from various gun captains . Fourth Master H. A. Walke  --  no relation to the Commander  --  appeared and waited on the companion ready to relay orders if the cannonade grew too deafening for the Captain 's orders , shouted through a little speaking trumpet , to be heard . Wishing someone would assign him a duty Dent gripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an access of terror , he might lurch down the companion in search of safety in the gunboat 's armored casemate . When a shell from the fort burst with a deafening report squarely betweenSt . Louis and Carondelet Dent became aware of a warm trickle descending his leg and only by making a violent effort did he succeed in preventing a further escape of urine . Scarlet with shame he stole ap171glance at Weaver , noticed that his lean jaws now were working to a more rapid tempo . Walke and the Chief Pilot seemed wholly occupied in watching the fort towards which the Western Flotilla was drawing inexorablynearer . When a rumbling of carriage wheels warned that the ironclad 's bow guns were about to be run out again Commander Walke imperturbably turned to his namesake . " Instruct the Captain of Number Two gun to elevate three degrees . He 's firing into the bluff . " The Fourth Master had just disappeared when a terrific clang ! caused Carondelet 's whole fabric to shudder  --  the Confederates had got home the first of the thirty-odd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironclad 's bow guns fired for a second time something went screaming aoouwI close over the wheelhouse . Again and again shells from the fort  --  evidently they had some excellent gunners up there  --  glanced off Carondelet 's casemate . Peering in dazed fashion out of an eye-slit Dent watched St. Louis ' port chimney suddenly collapse about halfway up its length and topple over amid a serpentine tangle of severed guy wires to dangle , still smoking a little , over her side . Oily tongues of flame and smoke escaped from a series of gashes in the steamboat 's remaining funnel . To his great surprise Dent was able to command his voice sufficiently to speak . " Commander Walke , sir , that last shell has cut us free of the St. Louis . " " That 's good . Nevertheless , Mr. Weaver , I want us kept pressed close to the St. Louis , " Walke directed in an ordinary tone . " It steadies us both . " For the first time since leaving Panther Island Weaver spoke . " Praise God them snags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winked at Dent standing , great-eyed and white as cornstarch , a step behind him . " We do n't wear even boiler iron on our bottom . " Again and yet again Confederate projectiles ranged the four gunboats or raised angry columns of spray from the river 's surface , but Essex and Cincinnati now could take advantage of a broad reach of water opposite the fort and steam further apart . All at once geyser-like waterspouts commenced to rise between fort and flotilla to betray miserably poor gunnery aboard the timberclads . These were firing hopelessly short of their target . Thanks to a brisk slant of wind the battle smoke abruptly was cleared away and revealed telling hits the Federals were scoring all over Fort Henry . Plainly to be seen were sudden white puffs caused by bursting shells ; also shattered timbers and clouds of dirt flung high into the air . For some reason Dent suddenly became extremely conscious of the monotonous cracking noises caused by the engines ' exhausts . Now thatp172his initial terrors had become relieved the Connecticuter watched Essex , ever a sluggish boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke-clouded fort . Fort Henry lay on a low bluff not a quarter of a mile distant amid a semi-circle of burning huts , tents and barracks . He could even see how , occasionally , the Rebel flag was blown against the wind by the concussion of a bursting shell . " It 's a cold day , " Pilot Hinton commented with a wry grin , " but I 'll wager them Secesh bastards think it pretty damn ' hot . " " Yep . Glad I ai n't ashore right now , " Weaver agreed and deftly steered Carondelet out of the course taken by a giant oak which , with spidery black roots barely projecting above the surface , came drifting down upon the line of gunboats . " Do n't ' pear their shells can penetrate our armor , " said the Assistant Pilot . Commander Walke 's head snapped about , threw his aquiline profile into silhouette . " Silence in the wheelhouse ! When I desire comments I will request them . Can you steer two points to port , Mr. Hinton ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . Firing in excessive traverse is hard on their crews . " By now Dent 's ears had become so accustomed to this outrageous and confusing din that he could distinctly hear Matthew Arthur , Captain of Number One gun , order his big sixty-four pounder run out . At this moment the range had been closed to a quarter of a mile , so the Western Flotilla 's shells burst ever more accurately over Fort Henry . Conversely , the clanging rap of shell fragments smashing against the casemate grew more noticeable . An officer from the Second Division appeared in the pilothouse . " Captain , sir  --  " " Well , Mr. Gray , speak up . I ca n't hear you . " Walke directed sharply . " Sir ! That damn ' boiler iron we carry aft is beginning to split like walnut shells ; big sections of it are coming loose and dropping overboard every time we suffer a solid hit . " " How interesting , " Walke returned coolly . " Substantiates what I 've said from the beginning . Need real armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your division and order your crews to relieve those serving the bow guns . " " Aye , aye , sir . " Suddenly Walke stiffened and his hands clamped themselves convulsivelyupon his binoculars . " My God ! Look ! What can have gone wrong aboard the Essex ? " Presently it became unmistakable that big , ungainly Essex must have received a shot in her vitals because her stern wheel had stopped . Further ,  |p173furious  clouds of woolly-looking steam began spurting out of her gunports and pilothouse . " Christ ! " gasped ' Weaver . " She 's been hit in her boilers ! God help Sam MacBride and Marshall Ford if they 're in that wheelhouse . " Dent tried to speak , but could n't find his voice . Beyond a doubt any man occupying Essex 's pilothouse must now be dead or dying in the most ghastly pain . ' What were the ultimate sensations of a man in the act of perishing ? What lay beyond ? All that the preachers promised for the godly  --  or simple oblivion ? It was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thunder of the battle the horrified shouts of Carondelet 's starboard broadside gun crews , who had witnessed the disaster , could be heard . Like ants from a damaged hill , faltering , crippled figures struggled out of the hurt ironclad 's gunports and dropped into the icy river . Most of these never reappeared but a few arose to fight the raging current and cling to the helpless gunboat 's guards . Later it became known that LieutenantPorter , wounded and badly scalded , had , by force of the explosion , been blown bodily out of the casemate . He would have perished then and there had not a blue jacket of the Regular Navy dived in and caught his semi-conscious superior ; he then grabbed a line trailing from a bent and empty davit and had held on . Dent saw Daniel Weaver 's gaze flicker sidewise to Walke 's long and impassivecountenance . " Do we rescue , Cap'n ? " " No . The enemy is still firing , keep on . " Chills chased each other the length of Paul Dent 's spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly have taken to his heels , just as he had at Bull Run ; now , fortunately perhaps , nothing remained for him to do save to grab a hand hold and stand there , shaking like a colt which scents a bear , and watch a shell burst squarely between Cincinnati 's smokestacks . The explosion shore her starboard funnel off close to the ironclad 's hurricane deck and thereby reduced her engines ' draughts so that she dropped rapidly astern of Carondelet and St. Louis . The remainingtwo gunboats kept on , all the while maintaining so accurate a fire that enemy artillerymen commenced to desert certain of their batteries . " Pilot , maintain our present course . With luck in a few minutes we 'll be able to enfilade the fort , " snapped Walke and went below to correct Carondelet 's fire . Weaver dashed sweat from eyes grown hollow with fatigue . " Take over , Billy , I 'm plumb wore out . Just keep our jackstaff lined up with thattherefort. "  |p174He  grinned at Dent . " Wonder why them Rebs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He broke off when a hospital flag suddenly was run up . " Damn ' Confeds should have flown that from the start . " On threshed the diminished flotilla , on until their crews could see not only a series of battered and crumbling salients but also the muzzles of overturned cannon pointed helplessly skywards . " They 'll have to holler quits pretty soon , now . " William Hinton was speaking more to himself than anyone else . " If the Rebels reckon Andy Foote is going to haul out , they 're plumb mistaken . " A few moments later a flash of white cloth glimmered upon the shatteredparapets and stayed there until Cincinnati raised a cease-fire signal . Long since , the fort 's signal mast had been shattered , had vanished . Walke reappeared , his blue uniform jacket ripped open enough to exposethe blue-and-white checkered shirt he wore beneath it . " They 've quit , gentlemen . By God , the Rebels have surrendered . Reduce speed , " he barked at Hinton . Perhaps one hundred and fifty yards offshore , Carondelet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as clouds of jet smoke suddenly mounted into the sky upstream . A couple of enemy steamboats were attempting escape , their huge paddlewheels spewing spray and froth in frantic haste . Apparently Flag Officer Foote had no intention of being deprived of the full fruits of victory so a string of brightly colored flags dispatched the timberclads , swift former river racers , surging in pursuit . Cincinnati 's only remaining yawl was lowered and , a few minutes later , an officer appearedaboard Carondelet and saluted smartly . " Flag Officer Foote 's compliments , Commander Walke . Will you immediatelyproceed ashore to receive the enemy 's capitulation ? " But even before Carondelet 's barge could be lowered a gig flying a white flag appeared from that same wharf at which lay the Confederate hospital ship . She was bringing Brigadier-General Lloyd Tilghman , C.S.A. , in person to surrender Fort Henry . And thus it came about that a fort , defended solely by land forces , surrendered to a naval flotilla totally unsupported by troops . The weather had been so vile , the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to cut off the retreat of a vast majority of the garrison . As a result , there fell into Union hands only the Commanding General , his staff , and seventy-eight artillerymen plus some sixteen invalidslying aboard the hospital boat . The remainder of the garrison , some twenty-six hundred in strength , had been seen hurriedly retreating over a miserable road in the directionp175of much stronger Fort Donelson . It lay twelve-odd miles to the eastward upon the Cumberland River and barred a Federal attack upon Nashville . LORETTA BENTALOU AWOKE reluctantly when Cleodene , a slim octoroon recently assigned as personal maid to Lola May Askins and herself , pushed open a latticed blind . Immediately sunlight sketched an irregular pattern of black-and-gold bars across a pink silk counterpane covering Loretta 's huge brass bed . The girl yawned and , in stretching luxuriously , caused the deep lace collar of her lawn nightrobe to slip downwards until perfectly rounded breasts neatly pointed in coral became exposed . Still without fully openingher eyes Loretta tugged her gown back into position . Despite the ornate gilt and brocaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installing , the apartment 's proportions , the chandeliers of cut-glass , its trim and wallpaper betrayed the original owner 's good taste . Mrs. Wilber , who was a lot smarter than most people suspected , had purchased for a song this big , tastefully designed mansion of red brick . It boasted no less than four Corinthian columns before its porte-cochere . Most of its furnishings remained because , immediately followingthe capture of Camp Jackson and the consequent wholesale arrest of Southern sympathizers , Theodore Wilmer and his family had packed up in a great hurry and departed for Natchez . A graceful mahogany washstand supported a pitcher , a basin and a soap dish of pale blue French china all adorned with a profusion of small pink roses . Even the slop-jar matched . The window hangings were of green brocade trimmed with tiny balls of dark green plush . The undercurtains were of real Irish lace and the floor covered by a thick pink-and-gray Aubusson rug that harmonized effectively with those green window curtainsof which Mrs. Wilber so highly approved . In a gesture Cleodene had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared unseeing before her . In the act of hanging up a pair of lace-trimmed drawers the octoroon glanced sympathetically over her shoulder and inquired . " You recallin ' last night ? " Loretta 's full red lips formed a wry grin . " Guess I must have drunk more champagne than I realized . The General was very insistent . " She sighed as Cleodene gently massaged her forehead . " How is Phoebe to-day ? "  |p176The  maid 's Caucasian features assumed concern  --  she had grown truly fond of that mysterious girl whose head had got hurt so bad in the wreck and she offered her more than just the polite service she rendered Lola May , Clairette and the rest of Mrs. Wilber 's pretty , but often illtemperedprotegees . Cleodene clucked softly and carried an armful of Miss Loretta 's generouslyfrilled and flounced petticoats into a closet . It sure beat all about Miss Phoebe . The poor soul , she could recall nothing at all about her life before her arrival and long convalescence at the " Academy . " Laws ! She reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with all them high-steppin ' young whore-ladies she 'd fotched out from the East . Miz Wilber was the smart one , and lucky , too . Not one of those girls had suffered any real hurt in that awful train wreck  --  except Miss Phoebe and she was n't really one of the girls  --  not yet , at least . Her poor head had kept on hurting and she kept on having dizzy spells any time at all . My , my , she still could recall Miss Phoebe 's funny-looking country clothes , all splotched with traces of blood that could n't be washed out and her dazed way of walking and talking . Ten whole days passed before Miss Phoebe 's scalp had healed and that bodacious big knot on the side of her head had begun to disappear . Some piece of wreckage sure had fetched her one mighty mean lick . Of course Miss Phoebe was n't even a bit crazy , but it sure seemed mighty strange she could n't even remember her own name , even when it was told her  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleodene reappeared and smoothed out the green ball gown 's billowing skirt , retrieved its crinoline and various undergarments such as a shortsleevedcorset cover , canary-yellow silk stockings and a corset garnished by delicate blue bows descending its front . Them fancy French stays must a-cost Miz Wilber a pretty penny . Ambrosia , the freed girl who cared for Miss Clairette and Miss Lola May , had been more than a little right when she 'd sniffed , " Miz Wilber mus ' be addled spendin ' all dat doctor money on Miss Phoebe . That red-paid gal wo n't never pay off . She 's too frozen-like and hard-bodied fo ' most gent'mens . Besides , her hands is rough like she 's wuked on a farm or sumpin ' " Miss Loretta , anyhow , was riding high these days . The Eastern girl 's patrons always departed highly pleased and the next time paid a considerablylarger fee for her favors . As it was , Miz Wilber was sharply curtailing the number of Miss Loretta 's " callers " and proportionately increasedher charges until finally only General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Loretta sure was worth every cent Miz Wilber hadp177had to spend on fancy clothes . She was sumpin ' to look at when she got herself all prettied up in a green or a black party dress . No wonder MajorGeneralMixer was takin ' up all the time Miz Wilber allowed him , no matter what the cost . For a fact , only him and Colonel Buttons ever got to see Miss Loretta any more . In all her fourteen years of working about spo'tin ' houses Cleodene never had come across a gal so really full of fun , so warm-hearted and generous . Whenever possible she visited with poor , sick Miss Phoebe and brought her little presents and candy now and then . The other girls ignoredher , even made fun of her dazed manner . Most likely they were scared of Miss Phoebe 's beauty  --  when she " went to work " she 'd surely snake a formidable rival . While Loretta Bentalou breakfasted with hearty enjoyment her maid dragged a tin bathtub from one of three enormous closets opening off this big , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell me , who was at de pa'ty las ' night ? " " Mostly all Army officers , friends of the General 's , but there also were a few contractors and a real live Congressman . " The yellow girl chuckled . " Comes the day you git you a Congressman , Miz Loretta , I reckon you sho has reached the top of sassiety . " " You surprise me , Cleodene , " Loretta observed . " Contractors make a lot more money . I suppose you 've heard that some of them have piled up riches in only a few months ? " " Who ai n't ? " " Have you heard about the one named Everett ? He 's made quite a fortune in only a few weeks . " The maid produced a huge bathtowel , a sponge and a bottle of Florida water . " Ah has , honey . Misto ' Everett , dey sez , is de most up-and-comin'estman ' round dis town . Ambrosia she wuz sayin ' she seen him drivin ' along Walnut Street wid a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - blackcutter . She wearin ' a beaverskin coat . Dat Miss Leonie 's sho pretty , " Cleodene said , " but she ai n't a patch on you , honey , ' deed she ai n't ; ' sides she acts common as pig tracks , so they say , when she drinks even a little bit . Ambrosia she sez dis Misto ' Everett is real handsome ; lie a gre't big man wid yaller hair and side whiskers . " " Tonight I will see him myself ; they say he 's a great friend of General Mixer 's . " Only when the tub was steaming and fragrant with a scent of violets did Loretta Bentalou swing long legs out of bed and walk over to a cheval glass . When Cleodene started to remove Loretta 's nightgown the latter wavedp178her aside and with a flash of marble-white limbs whirled the gown over her head to stand fully revealed before the cheval glass . Once her waist-long mass of lustrous black tresses had been twisted into a chignon Loretta stepped into the slipper tub , sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by bathwater . " Tonight , " she smiled , " you must do your very best with my hair , Cleodene . General Mixer is escorting me to a small dinner Senator Blount Mason is tendering in honor of some naval officers who have come to take over that new gunboat  --  I think it 's called Benton , or something like that . I 've heard that this Mr. Everett will be present . " Loretta raised a slender foot above the bath 's surface and scrubbed it with unnecessary vigor . " You said he 's handsome ? " The yellow bandanna securing Cleodene 's black curls inclined . " Dat what Ambrosia she say ; he got de handsomest haid she ever did see . What you fixin ' to wear , Mis Loretta ? " " I 'll leave that up to you , " laughed the black-haired girl and squeezed the sponge to send a rivulet of soapy water cascading down the vat between her bosoms . " Shall it be the black velvet or my sapphire-blue satin ? " " You best wear dat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' purty hair and complexion bestest of all . An ' do n't go wearin ' no jewellery ' ceptin ' de General 's bracelet and mebbee dem diamond earbobs dat boatbuilder give yo ' . " Loretta stepped out of the tub and immediately became swathed in the bathtowel 's voluminous folds . She stood glowing , motionless while the maid dried her and then dusted her with sachet powder . " What you thinkin " bout , honey ? " " About that poor Phoebe . Give me my dressing gown and let 's go visit with her . " They found the convalescent in a tiny , bare room which certainly must have housed one of the Wilmers ' servants in days gone by . Clad in a neat and simple gingham dress , she was bending over a sewing basket . Seated in the sunlight her rich red-gold hair gleamed like a polished copper pot set in the firelight . Smiling , Phoebe got to her feet . " How are you , Loretta ? Did you sleep well ? " " Wonderfully , as usual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night ? " " Yes . " Cleodene closed the door and departed on her duties , relieved that a little more color was visible in the hurt girl 's sweetly oval face.  | " When are you going to announce your engagement ? ' " In good time , " laughed Loretta , dropping onto a rocker and , crossing her legs to a rustle of flounces , arched delicate eyebrows . " And how is your head this morning ? Can you remember anything more than yesterday ? " " I 'm afraid not . I try and I try to remember but I just do n't seem able to catch hold of anything . " " But you remember everything that has happened since you were brought here ? " " After about the first two or three days , " Phoebe said quietly , " and I 'll always remember how awfully good you and Mrs. Wilber were to me . " She picked up her needle and started to hem a new blouse , a very elaborateaffair that would eventually grace the lovely form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let me stay here as seamstress . ' " You are mighty handy with that needle , " drawled Loretta . " Mrs. Wilber said so . Does your head hurt the way it did ? " " Sometimes I get really sharp pains , then I just ca n't seem to see straight enough to do my sewing , but I do n't get those spells as often as I used to . " " That 's good . " Idly Loretta rumpled her generously long black locks . " What do you think about the Academy ' ? " she demanded quite suddenly . Phoebe 's large dark blue eyes swung upwards . " I do n't let myself think , Loretta . I ca n't afford to . I have n't a penny in the world and here I have a roof over my head , good food and decent employment and I have a true friend in you ; even if the others are hateful sometimes . " She arose and , crossing to a bureau , lifted out a bolt of cambric , then selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , viewing the mysterious girl 's long straight legs , erect carriage and finely formed head . If she were to doll herself up in a ball gown , fix her hair and use a little paint  --  not that she needed much with that fine , clear complexion of hers  --  she 'd surely command a lot of attention from the sporting element . " You do n't blame us for our way of  --  well  --  our way of life ? " " Judge not , that ye be not judged , ' " " quoted Phoebe and tucked half a dozen pins between her lips . Again and again she had reminded herself that this must be her attitude . Of course when she got strong enough and her head stopped hurting she would pull right out of here , find employment elsewhere . It was terrible not being able to remember why she was in St. Louis or from whence she had come . For a space she had really despaired when the effects of the concussion had been at their worst and she had almostp180always thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had some reason for heading out west . Mrs. Wilber had said that they had met aboard a train heading from Chicago to Illinoistown and St. Louis . If only Mrs. Wilber had n't thrown away the clothes she had been wearing , she might have obtained a clue , but undoubtedly they had been too torn and blood-stained to be preserved . It was a pity , too , that Mrs. Wilber had discarded her purse which she claimed had contained only a few dollars and a religious tract addressed simply to Miss Phoebe Whidden . Sometimes , when she repeated her name , she felt on the verge of rememberingsomething , but if she tried too hard to recollect that pain in the side of her head would commence . The doorknob turned and Mrs. Wilber fluttered in , in her usual gown of black silk and with gray curls bobbing agitatedly . " Well , well , how are we today , my dear ? " she paused on the threshold . Phoebe removed the pins from her mouth . " I 'm fine , thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will have that blouse ready tomorrow afternoon , " she added and flushed under Mrs. Wilber 's suddenly penetrating gaze . " Turn around , dearie , and let me see you in profile . Hum-m . It 's best from the left , which is lucky . Gentlemen generally escort a lady from that side . Hum-m . Nice legs , has n't she ? " she demanded of Loretta . " Prettiest I 've seen in a good while , " drawled the other . " You have n't had any dizzy spells recently ? " " No , ma 'm , not in three days . " " Good ! Good ! You must be just about recovered . Dr. Ashby says that except for your loss of memory you 're about as good as new . " The madam waddled into the room , circled about Phoebe with much the air of a horse trader inspecting a likely filly . " Yes , I expect you 'll do . When you 've finished , Loretta dear , please come to my room . I would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour later , Mrs. Wilber pointed to a green satin ball gown , inquired of Loretta , " With that red hair of hers , do n't you think this should be real fetching ? " Loretta nodded , lips compressed into a straight red line . " And I expect those lovely limbs will look even better in black silk . " Loretta again inclined her head . " Come on , speak up . I want suggestions from you , Loretta . You got real good taste . " " So you 're fixing to put Phoebe to work tonight ? " " How 's as good a time as any . Clairette 's sick and Lola 's come down with a streaming cold . "  |p181Loretta  arose , went over to inspect herself in the mirror , said , " You know , ma 'm , I would n't wonder but Phoebe 's a virgin . " " What of it ? So were we all once . " " Well , for all she ca n't remember who or what she was , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If a girl 's heart is n't in her work or if she is n't lazy , like me , the men wo n't cotton to her . " Mrs. Wilber 's bright black eyes hardened . " You trying to tell me my business ? I tell you that girl 's going to be the best , except perhaps you , dearie , I have ever had . My God ! Those legs of hers alone would make a stone saint jump , and did you notice her bust ? It 's just like one of them scandalous Greek statues I saw in Washington , puts me in mind of The Greek Slave . ' She 'll take to this business like a duck to water , mind my words . A girl is n't given a face and a body like that just to teach Sunday School . " " Maybe you 're right , ma 'm . You know more about it than I do . I 'm no judge on account of I like this life , but I still say I do n't think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To a sibilant hiss of silk petticoats Mrs. Wilber crossed to a black walnut chiffonier , pawed in one of its drawers and produced a rhinestone necklace and a pair of earbobs to match . " These will go well , " she announced , " and , come to think of it , there is an old rooster here in town who 'll pay a mighty fancy price to break in a virgin . " She backed off admiring the dress and the jewellery she had tossed onto it . " Now run along , dearie , and get some rest . General Mixer 's coming for you tonight and mind you have Cleodene set those curls at the back of your head tighter than she did the last time . " THE AFTERNOON HAD deteriorated from a pleasant , wintry day into a raw and foggy twilight . A warm wind beating up the Mississippi had poured over the still-frozen plains creating a stifling miasma rendered dirty and noxious by coal smoke from thousands of chimneys . Already Cleodene and Ambrosia were hurrying about igniting gas jets with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string flared . Loretta Bentalou , in a wrapper of pink silk , advanced furtively along the corridor outside her room , then on tiptoe ascended a stair leading to the third floor and the room occupied by Phoebe Whidden . She did n't want to have George , the big ex-prizefighter who masqueraded as butlerp182of the Academy , catch her . Actually he was there to handle obstreperous patrons and administer discipline to Mrs. Wilber 's charges . Daylight having failed , Phoebe Whidden lay upon her little iron bed planning the finishing touches on Miss Clairette 's blouse . If she really had been asleep she would never have heard that faintest imaginable tap at her door . She half roused and then sat straight up when Loretta Bentalou whisked herself inside and reclosed the door behind her . In the half light the girl 's eyes seemed enormous . " Listen , honey , " she whispered , " you 've got to get out of here  --  quickly ! Quickly ! " " Tonight ? " " My God , yes , tonight ! Just as fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why ? Where would I go ? " " I do n't know where you would go , but if you value your chastity , get out of here . Quick ! " Phoebe blinked , trying to pull her wits together . " But  --  but Loretta , what in the world ? " " Never mind ! " muttered the other . " You 're a good girl and I would give my half interest in hell to be just like you , but it 's too late . " Her voice changed and she spoke crisply . " Look , honey , in about half an hour by my reckoning , Mrs. Wilber and George will come up here . You are to be moved to a room downstairs . There will be a green ball gown in it , pretty shoes , silk stockings , even a necklace . " A cold flood seemed to engulf Phoebe . " But , but Loretta , where can I go ? " " I do n't know , silly ; that 's for you to find out . Anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her hand , smiled a quick flashing smile . " Here 's ten dollars cash and a little ring you can sell . Believe me , honey , do as I say  --  get out of here . " Strange , Loretta thought , I should risk this , for all I 'm content with the way things are . Phoebe was saying , " But I 've no cloak , no street clothes . " " Here is a dress is n't too flashy and I , " she grimaced , " borrowed this cloak of Clairette 's . She 's tired of it . " In that bemused manner which had been hers during the past weeks , Phoebe tucked the bill and the ring into the neck of her dress . Then she flung both arms around Loretta 's neck . She could n't find anything to say , which was just as well because footsteps were advancing along the corridor , paused before the door then hurried on . " Take care of yourself , honey , " breathed Loretta , " and sometime if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Reckon I may need a little fire insurance someday . Good-bye , dearie , and good luck . "  |p183Thanks  to Cleodene 's guidance and the timing of her departure , Phoebe slipped out of the Academy 's side door quite unobserved . " God bless you , Cleodene , " she whispered . " I will never forget your kindness . " " And de Lawd watch over you , Miss Phoebe . I hate to see you out on de street like dis . " " Can you suggest any place I could go ? " Voices from inside the house caused Cleodene 's eyes to widen and instantly she closed the door . Clairette 's mantle was too small Phoebe realized as she hurried off down the brick sidewalk stumbling now and then because the fog had so shrouded the already-inadequate street lamps it was difficult to keep one 's footing . If only she had some idea where to go ! But she had n't , not having set foot outside of the Academy since her arrival in town . She shrank into a doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then blundered on up a side street along which clattered a succession of carriages and mounted officers . It seemed she must be heading in the right direction for shops , most of them shuttered for the night , became more numerous . She guessed she must be paralleling the river since off to her left was sounding the mournful tooting of some fog-blinded steamboats . " I wo n't panic ! " she told herself . " I wo n't because I must n't . " Phoebe hurried along , not at the brisk pace customary with her but somewhat uncertainly ; her strength obviously had not been completely restored . She looked about for a policeman but saw nobody answering that description . A party of rivermen bursting suddenly out of a bar confronted her . " Give us a kiss , Sis , " one of them invited and flung an arm about her shoulder . " Oh no ! Please ! Please ! I 'm on my way to meet my fiance , " she lied in desperation . " He will be here any minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mumbled apology and hurried after his companions . At the end of another ten minutes ' walking she found herself on the verge of a run-down residential district where the houses most certainly had seen better days . Presently a sign : " Mrs. Mallory 's Genteel Boarding I Iouse " struck her eye . Breathing a silent prayer that this establishment might live up to its pretentions she tugged at the bell pull , heard a tiny jangling from the depths of the house . A hatchet-faced woman with gray hair skinned back into a tight bun at the nape of her neck opened the door on a chain and demanded her business.  | " I  --  I 've got to find a room , " Phoebe faltered . " Do you have any rooms to rent ? " " Might and I might not . Come inPhoebe found herself in a narrow hallway that reeked of stale cooking but otherwise seemed clean enough . She underwent the landlady 's criticalinspection with an uncertain smile on her lips . " You look decent enough , Miss  --  ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I  --  I lost it on the train . I expect it was stolen . " " Huh ! Where you from ? " " The East . " " What are you doing here ? " " I  --  I am looking for employment . I am a seamstress . " " Got any money ? " " A little , " Phoebe was cautious . " Can you pay three dollars a week for your room and breakfast ? " " Why  --  why yes . Yes , I can . " " Let 's see the color of your money . " Critically the boardinghouse keeper inspected Loretta 's ten-dollar bill by the hall light then sniffed it . " Perfumedmoney is new to me , " she grunted , then made change from a purse strapped to her belt . " I reckon you can have the room , young lady . What are your sympathies ? North or South ? " " North , I guess . " " That 's good . I got driven out of Kansas by a parcel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want any Southern sympathizers in this place . " She put foot to the staircase and , talking all the while over her shoulder , led upwards . " Now this is a respectable establishment so I wo n't stand for you entertaining gentlemen in your room ; the front door is locked for the night after ten so do n't go carousing about town . " Before an ill-painted door she hesitated . " Got any nightclothes ? " " No , I am afraid not . Everything I had was in my valise . " This was true enough ; her bag had been lost or stolen , Phoebe reassured herself . " Well , you and my daughter are about of a size . Maybe she can spare you a nightshift . " From a ring jangling beside her purse , she detached a key , pushed back the door . The furniture consisted of a plain cast-iron bed much like that back at Mrs. Wilber 's , a stand with a cracked washbasin and pitcher and a plain , straight-backed chair . There was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of pegs driven into the wall . The landlady set down a kerosene lamp with a metal reflector . " This gets filled twice a week , " she announced , " and no oftener , so do n't go wasting coal oil . Good night . " PHILO DAINGERFIELD CAME slipping into the Western Arrow Contracting &; Supply Company 's offices bearing disturbing news : a change in command over the Confederate garrison on Island Number Ten was imminent . Therefore it would be impossible for Matt Everett to attend Major-General Mixer 's banquet in honor of Congressman Blount Mason . " Ai n't no two ways about it , Matt . Either we 've got to round up our crew and shove off tonight or wait maybe a couple o ' months till Mr. Bullwinkle can arrange us a new set of recognition signals . We 'd sure lose a mint of money by waiting . " Matt bit off the end of a seegar and glowered across his office at a long row of prints depicting various celebrated steamboats . He and Philo occupied unusually spacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was on the levee at the foot of Washington Street . " Damnation ! Of course we must leave tonight , but Leonie surely will want to lay me out in lavender . She bought a new gown just for old Mixer 's banquet . " He laughed shortly . " I 've bet Charley Buttons a thousand that Mixer 's new fancy ca n't even hold a candle to my Leonie . Would have been fun to watch those two hussies tangle , in a polite way , of course . " Philo 's slight figure dropped wearily onto a cane-bottomed rocker . " Maybe you 're saving money at that , Matt . Hear tell this Loretta Bentalou'sgot black hair , big , dark blue eyes and the prettiest figger this side o ' New York . " Matt 's expression softened . " I used to know a girl with red hair . " " Did you ? Where ? " " Oh , hell , that 's neither here nor there . " After scribbling an excuse to Leonie , Matt rang a bell to summon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulac lives ? " The boy grinned . " Yas , surl ' Deed Ah do . Ah kin git to Numbah " Twenty Lucas Street ' side of ten minutes . " A twenty-five-cent shinplaster sailed over to be caught by the messenger'seager hand . " Present Miss Leonie my compliments and tell herp186I 'm very sorry to have to disappoint her . Tell her I 'll fetch her back a nice present . " Once the door closed , he turned to Philo . " Cargo 's all stowed ? " " Yep , and the boat 's trimmed right . I do n't want the water uneven in our boilers  --  may need every pound of pressure they can raise before this trip 's done . Only items we 're lackin ' are the percussion caps and medicines , but Greenway swore they 'll be on our dock by ten o'clock . " " They 'd better be . ' Matt raised sandy eyebrows . " How 's the River ? " " In good stage for wintertime and the ice ai n't too bad right now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the creeks and little rivers up there is locked tighter than a duck 's foot in the mud . " " ' What about Cairo ? Is our friend Major Bridges still on duty at Camp Defiance ? " " Yes . Bullwinkle got a telegram from him yesterday . " Philo commenced to tug at his slender black goatee . " It 's below Cairo that the River 's got me worried . Bullwinkle heard from Colonel Hazeltine that he 's to be relieved three days from now ; maybe sooner . That 's why we dassent delay a minute . Rebs are rumored to have sent a new Commanding General down to New Madrid . " Matt scowled at a big brass cuspidor beside his desk . Damn ! He 'd anticipated parading Leonie in her new gray merlino pelisse ; that , and her coat of prime marten skins had cost him a pretty penny but Simon Quirk 's predictions concerning the astronomical profits to be won in certaingovernment contracts had made possible such extravagances . GodfreyslIt did n't seem possible but , even after all expenditures had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one hundred thousand dollars in the Exchange Bank of St. Louis . Although the Western Arrow could carry only ninety tons of cargo , she had proved uncommonly swift and handy and could navigate over a scant sixteen inches of water . Matt would never dream of replacing her . Somewhere Philo had learned of a device which minimized the loud cracking noise invariably caused by the steamboat 's exhausts . Also , by a judicious relocation of the Western Arrow 's rudders  --  she carried four in all  --  two to a side and located just forward of the sternwheel  --  she responded very readily to her helm . Shortly after Everett and his partner had purchased the steamboat they had , in order to reduce her silhouette and resistance to the wind , caused all cabins to be razed from the hurricane deck . Further , all but a quartet of staterooms on the main deck had been demolished in the interests of cargo capacity . On Philo 's advice Matt had caused his vessel to be hauled out at the endp187of December in order to equip the contraband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which should prevent the steamboat from sinking were she to run onto a snag bar , reef or sawyer at speed . Thus the Western Arrow had ample freight room , was handy and unobtrusive and could outrun almost anything on the western rivers , exceptsome of the big , sidewheel tugs . Matt Everett began to breathe easier and gave over his taut pacing about the totally darkened wheelhouse now that the batteries of Camp Defiance lay astern smothered in darkness . Only a faint glow against a bitter winter sky indicated the existence of Cairo , Illinois . Jaws rhythmicallyat work on a quid , Philo nodded to Charley Brebner , the relief pilot , and himself took the wheel . He appeared dwarfed by its enormous diameter . Once the contraband runner had steamed around the first bend below Cairo Philo observed , " Matt , I reckon we 'd best run at full speed all night . I aim for dawn to find us off the water batteries on Island Number Ten . We can always loaf about if we get there too soon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how you know where you are . All looks the same to me . " " It will if you do n't know yer river like a real close-fit pilot has to , " came the Kentuckian 's voice out of the gloom . " Ca n't you see yonder bank with the big trees along it ? " " No . I ca n't . " " Well , I can ; so can Charley Brebner . There 's other ways of telling where you are . By the sound a bell 's echo makes against the shore . Then again you can learn a lot from the run of the boat ; for instance , we 'll be passing over Scuffletown bar come a few minutes  --  you 'll notice we dragged water two-three times ? Now I know we 'll find mark twain water this side and mark three water on the far side of it . " " What 's a mark ? " " Same 's a fathom  --  six feet . So ' mark twain ' means twelve foot of water . ' Quarter-twain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . " " It 's still a shining miracle to me how you can find your way through darkness like this . Well , I 'm going below and tell Parker to make his stokers hump themselves . " Philo tapped the engine room bell three times to alert the engineer , then Matt , jamming a seegar into a corner of his mouth , swung down the companion hatch and out of the pilothouse 's sable chill . Right now he was conscious of an uneasiness not associated with previous expeditions . Why ? Well , there was that wholly unexpected and impending relief from duty of Lieutenant-Colonel Hazeltine . Suppose that venal gentlemanp188already had been supplanted by some patriotic hot-head who believed in shooting first and talking later ? What if Hazeltine , for some reason , had been unable to warn his successor that because the Western Arrow was bringing downriver supplies sorely needed by the Confederacy his batteriesmust under no circumstances fire upon a freighter showing a red , a blue and then a red light at her masthead ? Since the Western Arrow steamed quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , puncture her steam chest , boiler or sever one of the several steamlines supplying the cylinders . In such an event all aboard would very likely perish ; by drowning if they were lucky , amid blasts of live steam that stripped flesh right off the bone , if they were not . Outside the engine room door Matt paused , aware that it had begun to sleet . He deliberated ordering the anchors dropped , but time and again Philo had proved himself intimately familiar with this particular stretch of the Mississippi . On several occasions Western Arrow 's guards actually had grazed the shattered hull of some wreck or , at the last moment , had skirted an all but invisible sandbar . But could even so expert a pilot as Daingerfield find his way through this stinging , hissing darkness ? Uneasily , Matt tramped aft past tarpaulin-protected bales of blankets and big cases of harness and shoes . Briefly a small voice pled , " These goods you are fetching South will help to kill Maine boys like Thad Tyler , Billy Hildridge , Harry Watson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " To hell with it ! " he grunted . " They knew the chances they were taking when they enlisted . Besides , if I do n't benefit from this trade Quirk , Greenway , Feldman and the rest will . " He tramped aft circling the main deck to make certain no crack of light was escaping to betray his speeding steamer 's presence . Damned lucky , he ruminated , that the entire Western Flotilla right now either was under repair or concentrating along the Cumberland in preparation for an assault upon Fort Donelson . Reliable reports stated that this fortification was infinitely more powerful and better manned than had been Fort Henry ; probably because of its supremely strategic importance . He lingered staring into the frigid dark and listening to the monotonous hissing splash of the sternwheel 's buckets . Good thing such a strong wind was blowing ; it muffled that betraying staccato pop-pop ! caused by the exhaust valves . Easing the buttons of the naval pea jacket he had picked up in some second-hand store , Matt Everett entered the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Close that door , you damn ' dunderhead ) Want us to git Wowed clear out o ' the river ? " The sweating and oil-smeared engineer promptly relaxed when the New Englander 's big , familiar form came swinging across the floor plates . " What 's it doin ' outside , sor ? " called the red-faced chief fireman . " It 's sleeting and blowing hard , MacGuire , and blacker than a black cat in a dark cellar that is n't there . " He watched his Irish coal-heavers bend to their scoops . Matt never signed a Negro aboard his vessel . Slaves were expensive to replace in case of death or maiming or capture . These Irish when sober were dependable and courageous above the average . " What pressure are we carrying ? " Matt presently demanded of his grizzled Chief Engineer . In a dirty checkered flannel shirt and baggy homespun pants he was squinting at a row of brightly polished gauges . " One hundred pounds even , " he returned , " but I kin give him a hundretand twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " " We 're entering a tricky stretch of the River , " Matt explained . " Say , Mr. Everett , " MacGuire wanted to know while the glow of an opened fire door dyed his whisker-framed face a bright orange , " what if them Reb batteries on the Kentucky shore spot the flame from our fun-nels ? " " They 're mostly out of range , " replied the owner with an assurance he was far from feeling . " Besides , they do n't know we 're not one of their own gunboats . " From above the signal cord sounded three short taps , then two clangs . Instantly more bags of coal were dumped onto the floor plates to be fed into the insatiable firedoors . The ringing scrape of scoops over plating immediately before the WesternArrow 's four firedoors drowned out the sibilant hiss of a leaky connection , the monotonous threshing of the sternwheel . Perceptibly the thrust of cast-iron pistons accelerated , while the pressure gauge 's needle wavered upwards towards a red line marking the safety limit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds till Philo signals to slow down , " Matt directed . " I do n't want fire showing from the smoke pipes . " " Shall I cut them exhausts into the chimbleys then ? It 'll reduce our speed . " " Guess you 'd better . We 've been making mighty good time , " said Matt , then sought the wheelhouse wondering whether it was time to show his recognition signals . For the life of him he could n't guess how close they steamed to Island Number Ten . Worst of it was , irregular or **26;8160;TOOLONG State units were forever throwing up small , unauthorized batteries here and there . Right now Matt wished he had learned to enjoy the chewing of tobacco . To work his jaws might grant his overpowering apprehensions some relief . Supposing Lieutenant-Colonel Hazeltine 's friend in the Confederate Quartermaster Corps did not appear ? Suppose that funds to pay for the shipment had not yet arrived and in the media agreed upon , gold , silver or captured Union banknotes ? As usual the wheelhouse remained pitch-dark even with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from sleet that stung at his eyes like voracious insects . A snow flurry earlier had frosted Philo Daingerfield 's muffler , goatee , shoulder-long hair , eyebrows and visored leather cap . " Damned if I see how in the world you find your way ! " Matt wondered again , through chattering teeth . " River 's right wide here , " the Kentuckian admitted modestly . " We 'll be all right ' lessen we run onto a new wreck , a snag or a big bank of ice . After the next bend is when Charley Brebner and I 'll have to look real sharp . Down there I 've got to cross the current and ride the deep water ' round its outer edge . On one side  --  the Missouri shore  --  there 's the wreck of the Nightingale ' and over in Tennessee lies old Emperor Number Two . She rests just about opposite Reelfort Lake and its marshes " Suddenly Philo glanced over his shoulder and to his alarm , noticed tongues of flame six yards long commencing to stream out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Say , Matt , for God 's sake tell Parker to close down his drafts or we 'll sure enough get shot at ! ' On his way back to the wheelhouse Matt paused before the door to the stateroom occupied by lean and saturnine Mr. Cassius Bullwinkle . The Tennessean , surprisingly , was awake and poring over a sheaf of invoices . A half-emptied pint of bourbon stood at his elbow . He stood up , waved to a seat . " Howdy , Matt . ' Pears like Philo 's snakin ' us right along . " He pointed to a tumbler fairly jumping to the vessel 's violent vibration . " He wants to reach the upper end of Island Number Ten just at dawn . " " At this rate , he shore will , " predicted the Southerner . " When do you figure we ought to show our recognition lights ? " " Lemme talk to Philo first , " Bullwinkle tilted back in his cane-bottomedarmchair , jet eyes peering out from cavernous sockets . " Only one thing I 'm worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as silk if some dern Home Guard outfit hai n't throwed up a dinky little battery abovep191the Island . They 're always doin ' that , dern ' ern . They 're as independent as hawgs on ice and will blast away at anything they see . " Bullwinkle filled a jigger of whiskey and passed it over . " Dern fools sank a Confederatetug last week that way . " " Well , then , I guess we 'd better go up to the wheelhouse . It 's nigh on five o'clock . You 've readied your signal rockets ? " " Shore have , " the Southerner reassured him . " I been in this business a good while , you know . " " All right , come along , " Matt tossed the bourbon off , nodded his thanks and , after rebuttoning his pea jacket , stepped out into the chill darkness to discover that although sleet still fell it was not driving nearly so hard as before . Bits of ice kept bumping alongside but they remained small and therefore presented no real menace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , at the wheel . The latter was crouched on the pilot 's bench and peering attentivelyout into the night . While awaiting Cassius Bullwinkle 's arrival , Matt , for some inexplicable reason , got to thinking about Dexter . How had various neighbors reacted to his abrupt and unexplained departure ? What had Mr. Stetson done about his mother 's legacy ? Twice Matt had sat down to write  --  but never had written . What of Phoebe Whidden ? Most likely she must long since have pretty well forgotten about him . Maybe she was taking up with Fred Thatcher ? On the other hand he doubted it . There , in her mother 's kitchen , so much feeling had been evident in Phoebe 's glorious dark eyes . What had she said ? Something nonsensical about following him no matter what . Of course that had been only an excited young girl 's talk when her emotions were out of kilter . In the pilothouse 's gloom he gnawed briefly on his lower lip . Why should he have taken to wondering about Phoebe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , bright smile , the trick she had of raising one brow slightly higher than its mate when she was amused , and the rich , red-gold gleam of her lustrous hair ? Bitterly , he cautioned himself against any further moonings of this kind since he 'd not the least intention of ever returning East . Too risky . Somebody would recognizeand denounce him as Josiah Cosby 's murderer . On through the opaque and wind-filled dark threshed the Western Arrow , once more under Philo 's expert guidance . What an amazing man . Certain it was that Daingerfield once had ridden as a jockey , had worked Western steamboats as a gambler , and had been a peddler of shady landcompanyshares somewhere in the East . Of course , now there could be not the least doubt that he had been  --  and still was  --  a " close-fit " pilot along the lower Ohio and knew intimately the Mississippi 's peculiarities as farp192down as Memphis . When one considered the innumerable bars and other obstacles to navigation which must be remembered , in addition to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few pilots were familiar with more than certain stretches of given rivers . All at once aware of a quickening vibration beneath his boot soles Matt peered helplessly into that wall of gloom beyond the wheelhouse 's open windows . Godfreys ! It had grown mighty thick out there ! " Hal There it is  --  " Perceptibly the contraband runner 's easy prbgress slackened while she passed over a bar and felt the tug of the bottom . The vibration also became briefly intensified , then decreased as the ' WesternArrow re-entered deep water . What sort of reception would they be accorded at New Madrid ? The Confederate 's commander , especially if he were new on this station , might still be smarting over the loss of Fort Henry and so confiscate the Western Arrow and imprison her crew . It went without saying that the Southerners must also be anxious over the outcome of that big fight shaping up around strategically vital Fort Donelson . In Cairo , Generals Grant , Smith and McClernand had been reported to be closing in on that fortress like the jaws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philo 's voice drawling , " Must be close to five , Matt . I 'm telling Parker to reduce speed . " Thrice he pulled a signal bell cord with the result that presently little tongues of flame no longer curled through the smokepipe 's iron crowns and the Western Arrow 's paddle wheel slowed . " Reckon you 'd best warn Bullwinkle to rig our signal lanterns , " Philo drawled , but just then the swift little freighter became illumined by a series of blindingly bright flashes off to starboard . Then a roundshot and some shells screamed by sickeningly close to the wheelhouse . Somethingstruck the contraband runner aft , heeled her over and caused a sharp , cracking noise . " Keeristl Must be some wildcat battery on Nigger Head Island ! " gasped Philo . With the help of his relief pilot he cramped the wheel down hard a-larboard and so presented a diminished target to the maverick guns . Bullwinkle came pounding up from below cursing wildly . " Goddam ' hayseed milishy 's got no business there . Can we get clear before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " panted Philo . " Better show them signal lamps . " But even as the red-blue-red lanterns were run up the independent battery 's guns fired for a second time . Luckily this time it scored no hits.  |p193THANKS  TO A PREVIOUS visit tO New Madrid , Matt knew what ought tobe expected once they left behind the frowning but mercifully silent batteriesof Island Number Ten . New Madrid was a thriving River town . Situated on dangerously low ground it now was crowded beyond belief by the approach of fighting . Its sun-bleached , unpainted and uninspired buildings rose upon the Missouri shore , sprawled untidily away from behindits levee and a row of warehouses . The Court House , modelled on the usual Greek temple , was the only important building in evidence . Still , New Madrid remained a pretty place backed by tall woods and dotted with towering live oaks trailing ghostly gray beards of Spanish moss from gnarled branches . Profound indeed had been the relief of everyone aboard the Western Arrow when , beyond a single challenging gun to which Mr. Bullwinkle had responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had remained silent . Matt decided that if Union gunboats ever steamed this far south they would be in for a very hot fight ; at this point the Mississippi turned almost back upon its course , forcing traffic to hug the Eastern shore . A surprising number of steamboats lay tied up along New Madrid 's waterfront . The vessels most noticeable amid the huddle of transports , freighters and tugs , were two ironclad Confederate gunboats : General Van Dorn and General Jeff Thompson . Both were single-funnelled sidewheelersand undoubtedly much faster than any Eads ironclads Matt had ever beheld . Protected by casemates made of railroad rails bolted together , these small men-of-war appeared grimly efficient . Silently their crews tramped out on deck to watch this low , dull-black-painted sternwheelercome nosing cautiously into the levee . Undoubtedly the white flag fluttering at the jackstaff where the Stars and Stripes previously had been shown , must have aroused curiosity , for numbers of Confederate soldiers , mostly clad in butternut-tinted uniformsor parts thereof , came shambling along the streets of New Madrid to loaf about the levee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were also a good many rag-clad Negroes in evidence but practically no civilians . Probably it was too early in the day . Sleet had given way to rain which lashed at the Western Arrow 's superstructure and the wide guards running along her sides.  |p194No  sooner had the steamboat 's landing stage been lowered than Matt , Cassius Bullwinkle and Philo Daingerfield tramped ashore and sought a small group of civilians wearing ponchos and stovepipe hats . Significantly , only a single military figure was on hand , a stout , red-bearded fellow wearing a wrinkled gray tunic which bore the braid of a major curling up its sleeves . His trousers , muddied to the knees , however , were of checkered wool and tucked into clumsy cowhide boots . He wore a black slouch hat with brim turned down to ward off the rain  --  kepis evidently were not popular  --  or , more probably , unobtainable in this theatre of the war . Matt , splashing through mire and horse droppings towards the group waiting under a rickety shed , reflected on what he had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and new batteries added at Fort Bankhead , situated on a bluff immediately upriver , and in Fort Thompson a little way downstream . Many more troops were in evidence . That the Confederate High Command intended to hold this strategically important town of New Madrid in force was evinced by the fact that on a near-by levee cannon of heavy calibre were being craned out of a pair of barges which must have been towed up from Memphis and Vicksburg . Matt recognized several individuals standing in dripping raincapes and ponchos . Among them he was relieved to note Lieutenant-Colonel Hazeltine'scorpulent figure , cadaverous Tom Jennings and dignified-appearing Mr. Luke Pender who resembled a deacon , but who could offer the subtlestof bribes . He was reputed to drive the sharpest bargains and to negotiate the crookedest agreements along the Upper Mississippi . Fat littleMajor Holmes of the Confederate Quartermaster Corps , Mat reflected , was in for a hard morning , whether he knew it or not . Presently he would shake his head , blow out his florid cheeks and agitatedly stroke at his ginger-colored beard in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern civilian contractors sat down with Bullwinkle , Daingerfield and the master of the Western Arrow . They all assembled on the second floor of New Madrid 's dingy , whitecolumnedPost Office to wrangle over and eventually settle upon prices and terms . " My God , gentlemen , have you lost your wits ? How dare you ask four dollars gold for a single pair of Army boots ? " growled Deacon Pender . " Damn it , Bullwinkle , you know we just ca n't pay such prices ; and three dollars for a blanket . Good God ! On your last trip they were n't half that price . " Bullwinkle nodded equably . " I know , but prices are rising in St. Louis something fierce . You ai n't heard nothin ' yet ; just you wait till you hearp195what quinine , epecac , ether and arnica will stand you ; let alone a set of surgical instruments . " " Ah must protest , " rumbled Lieutenant-Colonel Hazeltine , looking very anxious . " We cai n't even think to pay such prices ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he turned to confront Matt . " Sho'ly , suh , you would n't jack yo ' prices on articles of mercy which will mend the sick and ease the sufferin ' of the wounded ? " Matt drew a deep puff off the long seegar Tom Jennings had presented and replied steadily , " I am not , and never have been , particularly interested in the humanitarian aspects of this traffic with you . I know only that Mr. Daingerfield and I have risked our fortunes and a good many lives to fetch these supplies down to you . " " What else can you expect of a pack of damnyankees ? " snarled Major Holmes , very red-faced in his faded gray uniform . " They 'd sell their sisters into a whorehouse for a profit . " Angry color surged above Matt 's collar . He cast a contemptuous glance at Pender and Jennings and another civilian contractor . " You can drop that kind of talk . Business is business . These gentlemen have ordered certain goods run through the Federal blockade . I have delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Major Holmes , and I guess you 'd better get out of this place before I lose my temper . " He turned to Jennings . " I did n't come down here to haggle with your Army . " " That 's entirely correct , " Bullwinkle agreed quickly . " I 'm afraid you gentlemen will have to leave . " " By God , suh ! " thundered Major Holmes , " I 've half a mind to confiscateyour boat and cargo and send you all down to Memphis in chains ! How dare you so shamelessly bleed an Army fightin ' fo ' its home and rights ? " " Just you try confiscating our boat , " Daingerfield 's voice cut in incisively , " and when the word gets out you 'll never receive another chest of percussion caps , case of harness , or another bolt of woollen cloth or  --  " "  --  Why , damn your greedy guts , are you threatening us ? " Colonel Hazeltine spoke up . " That 'll do , Major . Pender and Jennings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and let them negotiate with our Yankee friends . " The bicker ended with the two Confederate officers pulling on damp black slouch hats and stalking out , Major Holmes still breathing fire . " Friends , let 's get down to business , " purred Mr. Pender . " But first  --  " He clapped his hands to summon a sad-faced Negro . " Yas , suh , Misto ' Pender ? " " Just you trot over to the Jackson House , Julius , and fetch back hotp196toddies all around and do n't take all day . Br-r . It must have been infernal cold out on the River . " " It was until some addle-headed battery fired on us , " grunted Bullwinkle . " Hazeltine did n't do a thorough job . " During the strained silence which ensued Matt surveyed his surroundings . If anyone had attempted to clean this office in over a year it did n't show it . Cobwebs , mud-wasp nests and mould defaced walls of ochretintedplaster and the floor was foul with dried mud , cigar ends and splashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his benign expression the predatory and calculating lines . Mr. Jennings , however , radiated cordiality . Philo demanded while tearing off a chew of tobacco , " Now what in the world ailed you fellers to bring in them Army officers before our private deal 's completed ? " " Could n't stop ' em , " grunted Fender . " When Holmes saw your steamer heading inshore he came piking right over . Hazeltine came toer  --  quiethim down , like he did . " Julius , the Negro , appeared bearing a tray of pungently steaming toddies , then stirred the fire in a cast-iron stove . Matt , still drawing upon his seegar , tried to recall what he 'd seen during his progress through Jennings ' warehouse on the way to Fender 's office . Although plenty of cotton bales had been in evidence not one trace of Northern goods had he noted . Apparently the Western Arrow 's last consignment , and certain others he knew about , had been reshipped to equip the armies of Generals Pillow , Floyd and Albert Sidney Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Messrs . Fender and Jennings must be very hard up for fresh stock . Matt said , " I did n't particularly relish Major Holmes ' threats . " " Do n't take him seriously , " Jennings reassured quickly . " Hazeltine will handle him . He wo n't dare touch the Western Arrow or anything aboard . You 've noticed we 've got plenty of cotton on hand for your return trip ? " " At how much ? " " Forty dollars the bale . " The New Englander burst into peals of laughter . " Forty dollars ? My God , Jennings , are you crazy ? Now that your President has clamped an embargo upon the export of cotton I can pick up bales for half that price at almost any landing below Cairo . " " Do n't be too hard on us , " pleaded Fender , a note of desperation in his tone . " What I 'm offering is prime , long-staple cotton you can sell North for seventy-five dollars a bale and up . " "  --  If I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countered . " Sincep197Frenchy Fremont got relieved in the Western Department and your peoplehave begun throwing up wild-cat batteries , running contraband 's becomea mighty risky business . " Presently the last hot toddy had been drained and serious dickering commenced . For Philo Daingerfield it remained astonishing to witness that down-East shrewdness with which Matt met the Southern contractors ' every argument or objection with well-taken counter-objections . " Better meet my prices , " he warned them . " I know they 're stiff but this consignment is top quality and it 's dollars-to-doughnuts this may well be the last trip anybody will dare to risk . Once Foote 's gunboats enter the Mississippi contraband running will be a thing of the past . " Now just you take those ten surgeons ' kits  --  " Matt 's eyes narrowed  --  " they were manufactured in Sheffield , England , of the very best steel procurable . If you really want to help your people , this is likely your last chance . Once Donelson 's taken , the gunboats  --  " Unexpectedly Luke Pender spoke . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donelson wo n't be taken ! There 's a mighty powerful fort , mounting seventeen heavy cannons . I know . And six light batteries manned by the best blood of the Southwest . " " How d' you know so sure ? " Philo tugged at his scraggly black goatee . " Never mind , " Pender replied , " but I 'm certain on it . Besides , Generals Pillow , Floyd and Buckner have forgotten more about commanding troops than your drunken General Grant will ever learn . " " About that , I do n't know , " objected Matthew Everett , extending chilled hands to the stove , " but I do know the Army has a flotilla on the Ohio right now that pretty soon is going to clear this river down to Vicks-burg . " " Them gunboats 'll never pass Island Number Ten , " Jennings objected while riffling a sheaf of invoices . " My God , man , you ought to see the batteries we got there ! And the channel narrows so never a boat can get past ' thout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt turned , picked up his round felt hat . " Come along , Philo . Seems like these gentlemen prefer to talk strategy , not business . We 'll keep on down to Memphis where they understand the situation better . " The chilly office resounded to a thud caused by Jennings ' feet being pulled off a counter . He hurried forward , exuding good nature . " Now ! Now ! Mr. Everett , do n't you take on so . Who said yo ' prices ai n't goin ' to be met ? " Haggling continued but it lent Matt no peace of mind to watch a halfcompanyof infantry , wearing blankets and ponchos for raincoats , tramp down to the levee and line up opposite the Western Arrow 's landing stage.  |p198Pender  , when that movement had been pointed out , rose , muttered something in Jennings ' hairy ear . Bullwinkle saw , too , spoke sharply . " Yo ' pardner , Major Holmes , seems to be getting horsy . Send down and warn him to get them Butternuts out of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can whistle for yo ' goods  --  and profit . " " I will , ' Pender promised . He returned promptly and , without further ado , signed bills of sale totalling something over one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars , an example swiftly followed by Mr. Jennings and the third contractor , a sallow silent individual who in expression resembled a heartbroken bloodhound . One and all , the Southern contractors sighed , but licked lips over the prospects in store . Percussion caps , surgeons ' instruments , blankets and boots brought plenty of fine gold in this section of the Confederacy , remoteas it was from the seacoast and suffering already from the strict Federal blockade of the Passes below New Orleans . Presently Mr. Pender called his slave Julius and disappeared . At the end of a half hour he returned from the local bank lugging a bulging carpetbag and followed by his retainer bent under two large and heavy canvas sacks . The Southerner exposed big , horse-like yellow teeth in a friendly grin . " Reckon you fellers air smart enough to reco'nize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Everett ? " Matt smiled . " Might and then again , being a damnyankee , as your friend put it , I might n't . Depends what this speculation is about ; be it cotton or sugar , my partner and I will listen . But , ' he cocked his head towards the two canvas bags , " if it 's got to do with Reb-er , Confederate currency , I 'll say no ' so long as you ask . ' Color welled into Pender 's gaunt visage as he offered a sheaf of crisp new but crudely printed bills . " Now do n't be hasty , " he urged . " Right here I 've got some nice new banknotes fresh issued by the Sovereign State of Louisiana  --  worth a hundred cents to the dollar . " " And secured by gold or silver ? " The Southerner 's lips tightened into colorless lines . " No , suh . This currency will be secured by a tariff on imports and from the sale of cottonin London ; they will pay one hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt 's sleet-stung countenance . " Now that 's what Philo and I call an A-i security ; duties on goods that ca n't be imported because of the Union blockade , and unexportable cotton that 's piled up and rotting on every levee between Cairo and Baton Rouge . " " Then you wo n't hazard a part of your price in Louisiana money ? "  | " No , sir . " Mr. Bullwinkle , the intermediary , took pains to remain cordial . He picked up and surveyed a blue-gray banknote . " Why , it 's real pretty , but I 'd like to gamble this here bill is so common-printed any counterfeiterowning a job press could run off a couple of thousands in a day 's time . He cast Jennings a reproving glance . " Really , Tom , you had ought to know me better . Mr. Everett and Mr. Daingerfield and I do n't aim to take our price in nothing but gold or silver or Union banknotes  --  as usual . " " By God , you are a hard lot ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaved the carpetbag he had carried onto the table . " Christian honesty , forbearance and decency get a man nowhere in this world , " snapped Matt . " If you expect justice , you 're an almighty fool . Now then , you 've on hand the kind of money we want , or not ? " The Southern contractors grimaced and nodded . Then the silent one spoke at last . He snarled , " Reckon you Yankee bloodsuckers hev got us by the tail with a downhill drag , but I 'll pray my God some wildcat battery blows you all clean out o ' the River on yo ' way home . " ST . Lours ON this February afternoon of 1862 appeared to be heartily tired of such a long and unusually cold winter ; the city appeared distinctlyshabby  --  and busy . The most obvious change Matt noticed about the brick-paved streets and sidewalks  --  St. Louis had been very largely constructed of brick  --  was the absence of any great number of soldiers . He knew where they had gone , for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one transport after another loaded to their guards with cheering , jeering troops , and towing barges deep-laden with mules , horses , fieldpieces , caissons , forage wagons and a multitude of other supplies . Upon once more raising the long , low outline of St. Louis the contrabandrunner cruised slowly towards shore , riding deep under her cargo of cotton bales and hogsheads of brown sugar . To their surprise her officersnoticed many gaps along the levee where , in the past , one laid-up steamboat had been crowded against another . The Federal Government must have either bought or chartered these idle craft by the dozen for that forest of rusty smoke pipes , spreader bars and guy wires to become so thinned out.  |p200Still  wearing a seaman 's pea jacket , checkered woollen pants and a steamboat captain 's leather-visored cap Matt Everett swung along towardshis office . His tread along a muddy , wooden sidewalk was light because that long-staple cotton taken aboard at New Madrid promised fabulous profits . Even before he had departed on this trip the spinning mills in New England had been clamoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Yankees for that slender trickle of cotton bales finding their way northward were the agents of French and British manufacturers , now truly desperate for raw material . Never in the history of North America had the price of cotton and sugar soared so high . Matt chuckled while unknotting his muffler . Godreys ! He was doing all right these days . In three short months he had banked above a hundredthousand sound United States dollars ; probably as much as Josiah Cosby could have amassed in ten years ! He and Philo had been mighty lucky , he told himself , to have commencedoperations just when they had . Not many more contraband runnerscould hope to get through once the Union 's Western Flotilla devoted their efforts towards controlling the Mississippi . To prevent this the Confederate Government now was collecting a fleet of sturdy , ocean-going vessels and river gunboats supposed to be faster and better-built than the Union 's sluggish ironclad " turtles .  --  While in New Madrid Matt had learned the names of some of these gunboats . Owned by the Confederate Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorn , General Bragg , Colonel Lovell , General Jeff Thompson and General Sumter , among others . Commodore J. E. Montgomery , the vigorous and able Officer in Commandhad commenced carefully to patrol the Mississippi above Island Number Ten and , in accordance with President Jefferson Davis ' embargo , he was doing his best to halt a northbound flow of cotton or the export of that invaluable staple . In addition to this hazard , so many independent Confederate batteries were being erected nowadays on both banks that soon it would become impossible for Cassius Bullwinkle , who had remainedSouth for just that purpose , to suborn the commander of each and every one of these mushroom installations . Alas , only a single , wellaimedround shot was required to sink the Western Arrow or cripple her beyond repair . From now on , Matt decided , he would stick to the safer , if somewhat less remunerative , business of inducing through bribery or subtle blackmail , certain Federal purchasing agents to pay through the nose for essentialwar materials . Thinking he heard Philo 's footsteps on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that wiry little individual duck into a saloon for a quick drink and the purchase of a bottle of champagne with which to celebrate the completion of this enormously successful cruise . The hour being six o'clock no clerks were about the offices but night lights were glowing and the stoves were still warm . Matt tramped through the empty outer office and smiled to notice Mouser , the office cat , on guard at a promising rat hole . This feline , it turned out was the only living thing about the Western Arrow Supply Company 's premises . On his rolltop desk Matt noted a huge pile of mail , bills of lading , inventories and other documents accumulated during his ten-day absence . With satisfaction Matt noticed that during his absence two new desks had been added to the original four , graphic testimonial of his expanding business . His chief clerk also had procured some highly colored lithographs of various celebrated steamboats and had hung them about the accountingroom walls . Once in his private office the New Englander lit and turned up a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hum " Old Zip Coon " for , come nine o'clock , he 'd be driving out to that neat little house on Lucas Street in which he had installed Leonie Dulac . Lord ! How wonderful it would be to feel gay and affectionate Leonie 's soft and lively mouth upon his , to feel the eager pressure of her arms about his neck and to sniff her French scent so infinitely preferable to the River 's damp reek and oily fumes exuded by the Western Arrow 's engines . Tonight he planned for the two of them to partake of a quiet and intimate supper but tomorrow he intended to hire a dining room at the Planters Hotel and give a triumphal banquet . To it he would invite key members of the " organization " such as General Mixer , Colonel Buttons and certain other officers who had proved conveniently preoccupied while contraband cargoes were being landed . Of course Tobias Greenway would be included , along with Simon Quirk , his brother-in-law , if only to prove to the former that he had not misplaced his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of Greenway 's presence but that worthy undoubtedly would occupy himselfpleasantly enough in one of St. Louis ' fashionable establishments . Being flush he might very well patronize Mrs. Wilber 's Academy for Young Ladies , that most luxurious of all the bordellos . In her house , so ran the gossip in various gentleman 's clubs , MajorGeneralMixer had encountered an exquisitely lovely girl upon whom he had squandered a small fortune . Not a small part of this had been amassed through a convenient absent-mindedness concerning the Westernp202Arrow 's activities  --  along with those of certain other vessels likewise employed . Grinning to himself Matt settled into a swivelled armchair . By God , life could be good for the fellow who found sufficient courage to ignore conventions and take his chances with the law . He wondered how the redecoration of the handsome brick house purchased for his own occupancyout on Compton Street might be progressing . Right now he could visualize lovely , dark-haired Leonie flying downstairs to answer his knock . He guessed she 'd greet him with her usual scampering leap into his arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing an azure ribbon about her throat , the sapphire-blue negligee with its rose-point lace collar , black garters , and yellow silk stockingswith lace insets  --  and not another blessed thing . Leonie possessed the invaluable gift of appearing wildly appreciative of anything he did for her ; rapturously. she would refer again and again to his gifts , even very little ones . True , she had cause to be grateful . Had he not purchased her release from Madame Henriot 's Myrtle Hotel , and the necessity of pleasing a succession of generally coarse and unattractive males ? Now Leonie had a place of her own with a coffee-complexioned servant to care for her and only himself to please . Small wonder she was pathetically happy to pamper his sometimes insatiable tastes ! After removing his jacket Matt thumbed through a pile of correspondence , chiefly contracts to be negotiated , receipts and bills of sale . From the door to the outer office Mouser uttered a chirrup of greeting and strolled in gently waving his ringed tail , gravely to reconnoitre a cane wastebasket which , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was occupied in reading a long list of requirements forwarded by the Quartermaster Corps when subconsciously he heard a door open and close downstairs ; undoubtedly that would be Philo . His gaze descended the long list of desired supplies . Two hundred bolts of dark blue woollen cloth , twelve gross woollen drawers . Someone cleared his throat . Instantly , Matt realized that it was not Philo who had entered his private office . He whirled about on his swivel chair to behold a complete stranger in stovepipe hat and a brown travelling cloak , standing in the entrance . With his left hand the man raised his hat at Matt 's " Come in , " and strode in , his small , steel-gray eyes flickering about . " Good evening . Are you looking for me ? " Matt demanded . " You are Mr. Daingerfield ? " queried the gaunt , clean-shaven stranger . " No , I 'm Mr. Everett . " " Mr. Matthew Everett ? " " Yes . And you are ? "  | " My name is Pennypacker , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he heard the downstairs office door open and close once more . " Mr. Everett , I have brought you something from the East . " " From the East ? I do n't understand . I have no undertakings with Eastern firms . We do all our business around here . " " My errand has n't to do with business , " announced Mr. Pennypacker , in a deadly monotone , " This concerns a personal matter . " He produced a Colt 's forty-four revolver from beneath his cloak and levelled it at Matt 's chest . " With Josiah Cosby 's compliments , Mr. Everett ! " Matt had only time to realize that he must not have killed his father back there in Bangor before a crashing double report caused his office to resound . Something bit savagely at his right shoulder and spun him half about . Deafened , he lurched and would have collapsed if he had n't caught the edge of his desk . Then , as the room reeled wildly about him , he was surprised to notice Mr. Pennypacker 's stovepipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he realized that the stranger was swaying , with eyes fixed and grown round as marbles . All at once Mr. Pennypacker 's knees buckled and he collapsed onto the office floor like a huge puppet the strings of which had been cut . Hatless and clutching a still-smoking derringer , Philo Daingerfield came running , an expression of concern on his coppery visage . " You hurt , Matt ? You hurt bad ? " " Guess not , " Matt gasped , then removed his left hand from the wound to stare incredulous at fingers grown brilliant with blood . " Guess I  --  I 'm all right . Only w-winged me , high up . " Still steadying himself on the desk Matt watched his diminutive partnerwalk over with his foot to stir that long and sombre figure sprawled so slack upon the office 's turkey-red carpet . Philo squatted onto his heels , parted the stranger 's travelling cloak , and made a quick inspection . He straightened grinning . " Straight through the heart ; pretty a shot as I 've ever made . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into our place , " Philo explained while uncocking his little pistol 's second barrel . " Wondered what his business could be at this hour so I hurried up . " He fashioned a compress from a none-toocleanblue bandanna handkerchief . " Hold still , Matt , whilst I peel off your coat . Urn . He winged you all right , but you 're lucky . Iffen that bullet had struck a half inch lower you 'd have had a lame shoulder for life . Isere , take a jolt of this forty-rod . " With his teeth Philo removed the cork from a flask jerked from his coattail.  | " You heard what he said ? " Matt demanded presently though his ears yet rang from the revolvers ' report . " Reckon so . Who in hell is this feller ? " Thickly Matt replied , " I 've never seen him before . " " Who 's Josiah Cosby ? " " My father . Guess he figured he 'd better have me killed before I tried again to kill him . Please tighten that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " EARLY ON THE morning after her escape from Mrs. Wilber 's " Academy " Phoebe hurried downstairs and consumed a meager breakfast before beggingthe loan of a newspaper . A careful perusal revealed the fact that female cutters and sewing machine operators were in considerable demandso , to Phoebe 's infinite relief , she obtained employment in the garment factory of a Mr. A. J. Bulloch . The establishment was on Plum Street right across from the terminal of the St. Louis &; Iron Mountain Railroad . At first the work seemed easy enough , making infantry tunics for the Army , but the light was bad and the loft ill-ventilated and overcrowded . After two days the dizzy spells recurred , that , and a sharp aching in her head . Worst of all she twice was taken violently nauseated , so much so that on one occasion she had to be sent home and her pay of ten dollars a week docked accordingly . She managed , however , to keep on , thanks to the kind offices of the forelady who pitied this vague-eyed girl with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could no longer sew a straight seam , nor could she guide the thread into her needle 's eye . On a Saturday night  --  they all worked until seven from seven in the morning  --  the proprietor beckoned her into his office . " Sorry , Miss Whidden , got to let you go . Mrs. Austin has hung on to you as long as she could , but I ai n't in business for my health and the Quartermaster 's hollering for these uniforms like a pig under a gate . " Like a stone , Phoebe 's heart plummeted within her . " But  --  but Mr. Bulloch , what can I do ? Where can I go ? " " God knows , " said he carelessly . " I suppose you will land another job when you get to feeling better . " He turned his back . The results of her concussion grew no better , so for a week , Phoebep205was forced to lie about watching her pitiful supply of cash dwindle . She had simply had to buy a few underthings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time she had paid Mrs. Mallory her week 's rent , a half dollar , a quarter and a twenty-five-cent shinplaster were all that lay on the top of her chest of drawers . Of course there was that little gold and garnet ring Loretta had bestowed ; and when she secured , and promptly lost , her next job , she was forced to pawn it for an outrageously small amount , not enough to buy her more than a few skimpy meals . She certainly was missing those hearty repasts she must have enjoyed in the past because she tired so easily nowadays . Her clothes hung with increasing looseness upon her . Again and again she tried to hold a job but always that dreadful dizzinessand occasional nausea sent her out onto the street again to be pushed and jostled by the crowds that seemed forever to be on the move in St. Louis . Never had the city been so populous , it seemed . There was a sharp scarcity of lodgings , particularly of the inexpensive sort , so it came as a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week 's grace , curtly informed her that she would have to move elsewhere . Being a poor woman herself , she could not afford to maintain even a single unproductive room . And so on a chill Saturday evening , Phoebe Whidden stumbled down the worn stone steps and again drifted aimlessly in the general direction of the river . If only she were n't so hungry ! If only she knew of a single friend . Of course there was Loretta Bentalou and Cleodene , but she did n't dare go near the Academy even if she could locate it . Uncertainly her feet carried her downtown where saloons , restaurants and hotel fronts blazed with light . It was late enough now for streetwalkers , young ones who looked well enough by daylight , to begin plying their trade . Suddenly overcome by weakness , Phoebe sank onto a bench and listlesslywatched the traffic go by . She saw a provost guard frog-marching a pair of yelling soldiers off to some guardhouse . Had she begun to mend again ? Possibly . She had n't been ill nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could keep a job ? But this was Saturday evening . No factories would be open until Monday and she was penniless , without a possession in the world save the clothes she wore . 1ler head sank onto her chest and she huddled into Clairette 's mantle . Her feet had become damp clear through due to the heavy moisture on the streets and a wind off the Mississippi was icy . Dully she became aware that someone had halted before her . She looked up into the facep206of a Union officer , a plump , well-fed looking individual with rather a friendly expression about his eyes . " May I sit down , miss , or are you awaiting someone ? " She nodded . After all it was something to have someone to talk to . " Now for the life of me I ca n't understand why a pretty girl like you should be sitting here all alone . Have n't you any friends ? " She shook her head . " Where are you from ? " " The East . " " Oh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now look , " said he , " I have just come in from upriver and I do n't know many people here in town , either , so , since we are both lonely , what say we keep each other company ? " He spoke eagerly , studying her features by the fading light . " You look like a nice girl and one I would n't be ashamed to be seen with . " When he took her hand she made no effort to withdraw it . " Now listen , Miss  --  ? " " Whidden . " " I 'm in something of a fix . Friend of mine 's giving a big dinner and he invited all the people he does business with to come and bring a partner . " He unhooked the front of his overcoat , fumbled and presently fetched out a seegar case . " When is this dinner ? " The very sound of the word made Phoebe faint with longing . " Tonight , not till about nine o'clock , so you will have time to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever you say . " " Thank you , Mr.  --  " " Major Tucker , Charley Tucker . I 'm from  --  " but he broke off and said nothing more about his home . " But you ca n't come for me , Major Tucker . You see I have no home . I  --  I was put out of my boardinghouse today . I  --  was behind in the rent . " " Sa-ay ! That 's hard lines , Miss Whidden . Have n't you got any clothes , I mean party clothes , put away somewhere ? " A faint shake of her head was all he got for reply . " Well then , look , suppose  --  say , you 're hungry are n't you ? I thought so . Well , tell you what let 's do . We will go over there to that restaurant and get you something to line your ribs . Then , " he snapped his finger ecstatically , " we 'll go shopping ; get you a dress and some pretty things . Matt 's fussy about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing for it but to agree . " And what about after the dinner ? " she murmured as he assisted her to her feet . He winked . " We 'll see about that when the time comes . I guess you 'll feel a lot more like being playful after the party . "  | " I  --  I  --  really should tell you that I wo n't . I  --  " " Oh , nonsense ! Come along now , and let 's have a plate of stew . " THE PLANTERS HOTEL 'S principal private dining room had seldom appearedso resplendent . In a pair of ornate cut-glass chandeliers , in three candelabra and in several sconces , gleamed dozens of candles to cast a warm , yellow-gold radiance over a long , elaborately decorated table set for fourteen . From one of St. Louis ' few hothouses , ferns and great sheaves of pink and white roses had been procured with no regard to expense . Before each place stood a rank of wine glasses ranging from tiny liqueurs to long-stemmed champagne goblets . Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had produced their very best silverware , china and napery . Each dinner chair had arms  --  lest its occupant become unsteady , as was expected  --  and a handsome goldbound pigskin case of seegars or a small package done up in pink tissue paper and white ribbon occupied each place plate , while upon a gleaming sideboard sweated a whole battery of champagne buckets . Awaiting guests with plainer tastes stood a formidable array of whiskey bottles for the most part showing famous brand labels yellowed with age . A rich red carpet and yellow-painted walls lent an atmosphere of warmth if not of taste . " Everything is to yo ' satisfaction , suh ? " demanded Prescott , the urbanemulatto headwaiter who would officiate . " Yes . The table looks very well , ' Matt smiled . Godfreys ! What would the folks back in Dexter say to such splendor ? Even Josiah Cosby most likely would gape over this lavish display of hospitality . With each passing moment Matt was feeling oddly relieved  --  not only that he was not in fact a murderer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assassin . He , Matt , at least had had the courage personally to confront and to shoot down his enemy . Yessir , he now stood several cuts above his father in the matter of attempted murder . Prescott said , " Everything has been done , suh , just like when Gen'ral Fremont was here . What with livin ' in foreign parts so much that Gen'ral knew how to entertain them Frenchies , Hungarians and Eyetalians he used to keep on his staff . " " Looks elegant to me . " A small sigh of relief escaped the New Englanderfor , of course , he knew mighty little about such fashionable enter/taining , and Leonie , giggling and radiant in her new , wide-skirted dinner dress of pale rose looped in green and secured with many little bows of crimson velvet , knew even less . Too bad that when Leonie took a glass too many her speech and table manners became something to blush over ; she could sing , however , and , under sufficient inducement , would remove the more cumbersome elements of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for a deal of high kicking . Nor was Leonie averse to revealing the slim perfection of shapely white limbs  --  she always called them " limbs " during her more refined moments . Leonie now approached and passed a slender arm about Matt 's waist . " Oh , Matt , this sho'ly is the elegantest spread that evah was . " Ecstatically she rolled liquid eyes upwards , then smiled tenderly . " How 's your po ' hurt shoulder feel tonight , honey ? " " So  --  so . The doctor said it 's nothing to worry about . Look , " he led her over to a mirror . " Do you notice any bulge made by the bandages ? " ' No , honey . Dr. Lamson did a real clevah job . I love all them little ruffles on yo ' shirt front and that big diamond stud . I do declare , Matt , you are the handsomest man I ever did lay eyes on . " " And you 've maybe seen two , " he laughed , but continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guessed he had aged considerably and now looked older than his age what with his jaw line hardened and his brow divided by a pair of small V 's that had not been there the day he called upon Mr. Stetson . His yellow sideburns now had become real adornments instead of just yellow fuzz and he must have filled out quite a lot , for all he carried no fat at all . Somehow , his high and rather prominent cheekbones had become more pronounced . He examined the set of his white tie as arranged by Marcus , the dapper colored barber who customarily shaved him and cut his hair . Marcus , or so he claimed , had once been personal valet to Mr. William Harvey , one of the richest men in St. Louis , and it had been he who had told him where to have this elegantly cut dress suit made , and where to purchase his spotless white waistcoat , ruffled dress shirt and gleaming patentleathershoes . While standing before a cheery open fire and listening for the arrival of the first of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather-covered small box . " Prescott , " he said to the mulatto headwaiter , " I sha n't require your attendance until my guests arrive . " Prescott bowed and withdrew with the impressive decorum of a welltrainedcolored servant . Matt then kissed Leonie on the mouth and , capturing her right hand , slipped a ring upon its little finger . " Now look ! "  |p209When  she saw the size and hue of that emerald glowing between two smaller diamonds the dark girl 's breath came in with a sibilant rush , then escaped in an ecstatic squeal as she literally flung herself upon him and caused him to wince from the pain she caused his wounded shoulder . Her eyes filled while she smothered his face with kisses and , cooing , hugged his waist like a small and wildly excited child . " Oh , Matt , Matt ! Why are you so awfully good to me ? After all , you know I 'm but a cheap little  --  " His imperative gesture cut her short . " That will do , my dear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderfully sweet and gentle and kind to me during a  --  a difficult part of my life . I 've made a killing this trip , so I 'm rich now  --  it 's only right you should have a share in my good fortune . " He smiled a warmer and more genuine smile than she had ever remembered . This was because he no longer deemed himself a murderer , but of course she could not know that . After dabbing at her eyes with a tiny lace handkerchief plucked from between ripe and half-exposed bosoms Leonie peered up in mock horror . " Mercy ! Let me wipe off that lip rouge . I hear someone in the corridor . " The private dining room 's door of well-polished mahogany swung open to admit big and muscular Colonel Buttons together with that dainty Corybant from Mrs. Wilber 's Academy who called herself Clairette Vansant . In a sparkling gold and dark blue dress uniform with black tie Colonel Buttons was looking uncommonly handsome despite receding red hair and a constellation of freckles across his scalp . " Congratulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt 's hand . " I am delighted on its success " Colonel Buttons should be pleased , Matt mused ; he 'd just cleared a cool three thousand as his share , and without running the least risk . The two girls giggled and smiled as , expertly , they appraised one another'sgowns and jewellery . Claire immediately noticed Matt 's latest gift . " Merciful Heavens ! " she gasped . " What a perfectly go'geous ring ! My , you 're one lucky girl , Leonid " She cast Colonel Buttons a quick look , managed to pout a little . " Co'se I could never hope to have anything so fine . " The big colonel only grinned and patted her on the rear . At this point Tobias Greenway waddled in fairly bulging out of a frock coat and leading by the hand a frightened , big-eyed brunette who could scarcely have passed her eighteenth birthday . " This here 's Pauline . Just come to town , " chuckled Greenway . In a tight and poorly cut gown of flame-colored silk ornamented by much too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lips compressed , she greeted the other female guests . Be/cause this Pauline appeared to possess breeding and her voice sounded rich and well modulated , Matt felt more than a little sorry for her . " That was great news ' bout our Flotilla capturing Fort Henry , ai n't it ? " Greenway demanded from the sideboard as he poured himself a half tumbler of bourbon . " Most of them gunboats was built right here . " " Sure is , " agreed Buttons shortly . " Unless I miss my guess the River batteries will be firing victory salutes again pretty soon . " " Again ? " Matt demanded . " Saw a telegram this afternoon at Headquarters ; claimed Grant 's Army is closing in on Fort Donelson from three directions while Andy Foote 's flotilla is attacking up the Cumberland . Of course what with this terrible winter weather the Rebels just might hold out . We know Donelson 's a lot stronger than Fort Henry and held by a powerful garrison . " " We damn ' well better take it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business in Nashville this year . " Presently Simon Quirk and another contractor appeared escorting bejewelled , overdressed and excitedly giggling young women . Promptly all four made for the sideboard . " Wonder what 's keeping the General ? " demanded a major in the Quartermaster Corps . " He left before me  --  " " Probably he 's making his manners to Mrs. Wilber and his Sultana . " Buttons laughed , then turned to his host . " I say , Everett , have you ever seen this , er , lady friend of Mixer 's ? The one known as Loretta Bentalou ? " " No , but I hear tell she 's a raving beauty . " " This Loretta 's not only extremely handsome , " Buttons informed him , " but she 's also damned good fun . She 's got old Mixer turning handsprings whenever she smiles at him . " Prescott and a discreet assistant appeared ; champagne corks popped and gleaming glasses were lifted . None too subtly , Leonie displayed Matt 's ring and obviously revelled in the other girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sidled possessively up to the host . " Please , honey , how much longer we got to wait fo ' Major Tucker and the General ? Everybody else is here and we-all are just starvin ' to death . " A quick shake of the head from Prescott warned Matt that the main course of buffalo hump and wild duck could not be held back much longer without disastrous results . Chattering excitedly over their place favors the guests were about to seat themselves when the dining room 's double door was eased open and Prescott 's pompous voice announced , " Majo ' - General Mixer an ' Miss Bentalou . " Every head in the room swung about , epaulettes flashed and the guestsp211hesitated , hands on the backs of their chairs . A flash of golden buttons and a yellow sash encircling a corpulent middle shone at the entrance . Leonie 's hand swung over to nestle within Matt 's . " Honey , do n't you dare to think this  --  this Bentalou wench is prettier than me ! " " I wo n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor . " Well , well , " boomed Mixer , " this is quite an affair ! Sorry to be late , Matt , but I 'd some papers to sign . " " You are not the last , sir . Charley Tucker 's not here yet . " " Good . Good , " said the General accepting a tall bourbon highball . " Oh , yes , this is my friend Miss Bentalou  --  Matt Everett , dear . " The girl 's carefully made-up eyes widened a trifle . " I 've heard a lotabout you , sir , but nobody ever said you were so handsome . " Matt bowed laughing . " That 's because you evidently do n't associate with liars . Some champagne , perhaps ? " In rising impatience Matt glanced at his watch . It showed almost half after eight . What the devil could be delaying Charley Tucker ? He was about to signal his guests to seat themselves when the private dining room 's door handle rattled . Prescott opened it and announced , " Major Tucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet the last of his guests but halted with hand outstretched . His jaw had dropped ludicrously open . Leonie watched her patron 's expression freeze as there swept into the dining room a tall young woman whose red-gold hair had been trained into an overly elaborate coiffure which left a single curl dangling over the pallid perfection of a bare shoulder . In a crinolined gown of garish red satin looped with jet bugles , Major Tucker 's companion advanced , with clumsily painted lips forming an uncertain smile . " How do you do , Mr. Everett ? " she cried , dark blue eyes wavering . " Major Tucker has been telling me all kinds of nice things about you . " Suddenly gray-faced , Matt swayed before the dinner table much as he had after Mr. Pennypacker 's bullet had struck . " Phoebe ! " The name barely was audible . " What are you doing like this ? " IN ALL PRESCOTT 'S years of service he had never witnessed a moment quite so dramatic . All in an instant the Planters Hotel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness peopled by wax figures.  |p212The  officers , gentlemen and the girls stood rigid , as if confronted by a haunt . Everyone was goggling at this young woman , lovely despite her garish paint and the crude arrangement of her hair , at the obvious bewildermentof her ashen-faced host . " Phoebe Whidden , " rasped Loretta Bentalou . " Oh , my God , you did it after all ! " " I say , Loretta , " General Mixer turned a big , blunt and florid head ; his flaring black sideburns commencing nervously to quiver . " Why should my friend Everett address this lady as Phoebe ? " " I do n't know , but her name is Phoebe  --  Phoebe Whidden . " " How did you know that ? " rasped Matt . " I knew her at Mrs. Wilber 's  --  " " Mrs. Wilber 's ! Oh my God ! " Livid , he whirled upon Major Tucker 's companion . " What were you doing in a place like that ? " " As if you did n't know , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I  --  I was sewing , " Phoebe replied in a hushed voice and not for aninstant did her great , dark blue eyes desert Matt 's frozen countenance . " Sewing ? " chuckled General Mixer . " Wild oats , eh , my dear . " " No ! " Loretta started to explain . " She was hurt and lost her memory . She was n't  --  " " Be still ! " Matt drew a long , shuddering breath . So , despite everything , Phoebe Whidden had carried out that threat made in her mother 's kitchen . Somehow she had followed him out here . Dear God in Heaven ! Candelabra , mirrors , faces spun and swayed before Matt 's agonized eyes as the appalling truth became inescapable . On his account she stood yonder , still beautiful despite cheap finery and daubed features . She could not be one whit better than Leonie now clinging so tenaciously to his sleeve and hissing , " Do n't you dare pay attention to that hussy or I 'll scratch her eyes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt stood glaring into Phoebe 's wide and bewildered eyes . Leonie in desperate gaiety cried , " Come on , folks , let 's sit down and eat . Me , I 'm simply starvin ' ! " Had her voice been the squeak of a mouse Matt might have paid more attention . He shook himself free , walked the length of the table , turned to plump and definitely bewildered Major Tucker . " This girl is my fiancee , " he announced in a clear , penetrating voice . To General Mixer he said , " Will you kindly assume my place as host ? I must leave . " Major Charley Tucker turned to Phoebe . " What in hell is this ? " he exploded , but she remained rigid , clutching the back of a chair and staring dazedly at Matt 's tall , black-clad figure.  |p213Slowly  , wonderingly , Phoebe 's gaze then wavered over to her escort . " I do n't understand this , really I do n't , Major Tucker . I seem somehow to recognizeMr . Everett , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen him before . " " Of course not ! " shrilled Loretta Bentalou . " I tell you her head was hurt , badly , in a train wreck . Beyond her name she ca n't remember --  " "  --  Of course I wo n't take over as host ! Really , Matt , this is nonsense , sheer , utter nonsense , " the General broke in loudly . " Let 's have done with this play-acting , dramatic as it is , and drink a toast to our generous and handsome host and to his luscious Leonie. '  --  " No ! Please do n't : ' " Come off it , Matt , do n't act so silly . " Again Leonie pulled at Matt 's sleeve , causing him to wince because of his wounded shoulder . Greenway pushed his enormous bulk forward . " Sure you ai n't already had a few drinks too many , Matt ? Do n't blame you what with that mean trip upriver and getting the Western Arrow piled up on that sandbar for a while . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lifeless . " You take over , Colonel . Miss Whidden and I are departing . " " Oh , no . We are your guests ! " Colonel Buttons protested . Major Tucker stepped before his companions and the double row of buttons descending his solid figure flashed warningly . " Look here , Matt , " he boomed , " I do n't know what you have in mind , but Miss Whidden is my partner . You 're going too far , much too far , with your jest . " " This is no jest . This  --  this girl is from my home town . We were en-gaged  --  " " Who is she ? " The New Englander 's eyes began to glisten . " That 's of no importance here . She is leaving this place with me at once . " " Phoebe 'll do nothing of the sort ! " roared Charley Tucker , going scarlet as an outraged turkey cock . " I escorted her here and she 'll stay with me . " Leonie commenced to wail . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like this ? Ai n't I always been good and agreeable to whatever you asked of me ? " The sound of Matt 's breathing was momentarily audible in the brilliantly lit dining room . " You have , Leonie , " he said without looking at her . He kept his gaze fixed on Tucker 's enraged countenance . " Leonie , the house in Lucas Street , the carriage and pair , everything I have given you and five thousand dollars , will be yours . " " Oh , honey boy ! Ai n't you just too sweet and gen'rous fo ' words ! " Leonie actually danced a few steps , then gulped a glass of champagne.  | " Heah 's to you , honey , and yo ' new gal . " She had the temerity to wink at Greenway . Certainly she should please him better than that skinny , washed-out looking Pauline . Returning his gaze to Phoebe 's immobile features , Matt stepped forward . " Phoebe , you do remember me ? " " No , " she replied in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have met who knows who I am  --  who I was , rather . Sometimes I  --  I almost seem to remember , but I never can quite . I do feel , though , that we knew each other somewhere . " " Dexter . " " Dexter ? Where is Dexter ? " Matt drew himself up , offered Phoebe his arm . " I 'll tell you later . But now we are leaving . " " Like the devil you are ! " roared Major Tucker . " You think I 'm going to stand by like a ninny and let you take away a girl I 've just squandered sixty dollars on ? " In a calm but menacing voice Matt informed him , " You 've made a mistake , Charley . This lady will not be your companion tonight . Her real self , whom you 've never met , is sweet and innocent . " " This trollop sweet and innocent ? " chuckled Mixer . " God , but that 's rich ! " Such a roar of shrill and raucous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hall . If he knew the signs he reckoned a couple of police officers would come in handy mighty soon . " God damn it , Everett , you are drunk ! " Tucker shouted and doubled his fists . " If you think for one minute I am going to let my little friend go with you  --  " " Phoebe , " Matt called above the tumult , " will you do as I say ? Will you come with me ? " Piteous uncertainty became evident in Phoebe 's manner as she glanced first from one then to the other of the principal figures . " Do n't you dare listen to this crazy , drunken fool ! Come here to me , " cried Tucker . Certain of the guests , experienced in brawls , caught up bottles while the girls retreated , twittering , across the dining room , not altogether displeasedby the drama of this moment . " Since you seem to know who I really am , Mr. Everett , " Phoebe 's voice sounded jerky , toneless , " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed surprising in a man of his bulk , Tucker aimed a hard swing . Experienced by now in the matter of rough-and-tumble , Matt easily avoided the blow and countered with an uppercut which , although it caused agony to his hurt shoulder , snapped the major 's head back sop215violently that he reeled into the table , then fell amid a crashing of china , glassware and silver . " Stop it , " roared the General . " Stop it , I say ! " " Jesus God ! " Greenway gasped , goggle-eyed . " You gone crazy , Matt ? Mixer and Tucker can put every damn ' one of us out of business . " " I do n't give a thin damn if he does . " Matt was standing over the fallen officer . Aware that blood from the reopened wound was trickling down his shoulder blade , he offered Phoebe an arm and conducted her to the doorway . There he paused long enough to call back , " Sorry my party turned out this way . Good luck to you all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you taking me ? " Phoebe Whidden inquired from the depths of Matt 's opera cloak . " To a house I 've just bought , " came his stony response barely audible above the brisk clatter of the horseshoes over paving . " Although it 's only partially furnished I guess we can make out there overnight . " Because a warm rain had washed the brick pavements clear of snow and ice , the rasping of their hack 's steel tires sounded very loud . Phoebe peered sidewise at the tall , tight-jawed figure beside her . He had not delayedto borrow an overcoat so his ruffled shirtfront shone crisply in the light of the carriage lamps . She started . " What 's that on the back of your hand ? " " Blood , I expect . During my little debate with Charley Tucker I must have opened a wound I suffered the other day . " At this hour many hacks , omnibuses and private carriages were travelling along Gratiot Street with lights gaily dancing and flaring . By their passing radiance Matt 's yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me who I really am . Please , Mr. Everett . " Phoebe demanded from the hack 's musty-smelling shadows . " For Heaven 's sake do n't call me ' Mr. Everett . ' Ca n't you recall me ? I 'm Matt  --  Matthew Hovey . " He winced , caught her by both hands and peered intently into her great dark eyes . " We grew up together in Dexter , Maine . " " Hovey ? " the girl repeated uncertainly . " Hovey ? Seems I have heard that name before . " " You have . You 've heard that name all your life . My mother , Abigail I Iovey , taught you to read , to write and to figure . " " Did we really grow up together ? " Phoebe 's confusion was pitiful to behold . " We did , " his powerful profile became puckered as he nodded . " Your father is Azel Whidden . He 's a farmer . " In desperation he queried , " Ca n't you remember anything at all about Dexter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest upon his . Some of the blood on it stained a black velvet bow gracing her wrist . " Mr. Everett , er , Matt , I wish I could , but I ca n't seem to recall a thing before I was brought here to St. Louis . " Suddenly her eyes flickered up . " No . That 's not so . The other day I think I remembered something ; a black-and-white collie dog I once owned , but I ca n't recall his name . ' " It was Benjie . " " Benjie ! Of course . " In the semi-darkness her teeth glistened in a delightedsmile . " What can my parents  --  do I have parents ? " " You had last November , " he assured her gently and tucked his uninjuredarm about her shoulders . " Whoa , you Columbus ! " The colored hack driver pulled up . " Heah we is , suh . Number Twenty-eight Compton Street . Dat right ? " " That 's correct . " Once the driver had clambered down to unfold his carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare in these days of little hard money . " A whole silber dollah ! De Good Lawd bless you , suh ! Hopes you and de pretty lady has you a right elegant time . " The old Negro 's teeth shone in the carriage lamps . " Be quiet ! " Matt snapped and led Phoebe across the sidewalk and into the vestibule of his recent purchase . When he tugged the bell handle a melodious tinkling commenced deep within this handsome red brick edifice . It being both cold and raw on the stoop Matt commenced silently to curse Lambert , his valet 's slowness . Presently a lamp glimmered through the vestibule door 's ground-glass panels . " Who dat ? " quavered a voice . " It 's Mr. Everett . Open up and be quick about it . " Lambert , otherwise clad in a nightgown and cap , was wearing a shawl about stooped shoulders . A fringe of white hair gleamed in silvery contrast to his wrinkled and sable features as , hastily , he slipped off the guard chain , saying , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home till mawnin ' . " " You thought wrong . " " Mah Gawd , suh ! Yo ' wound 's done opened up again ? " " Yes . But the bleeding has stopped . Go make us a pot of coffee , then get into your clothes . " " Yassuh , directly , suh . " Backing away Lambert goggled at this thin young woman with the red-gold hair who stood gazing curiously down the long and completely unfurnished hallway . " In there , " Matt opened a door to his right . Within was a study obviouslypartially decorated but containing chairs and a sofa . A sea-coal fire blinking redly in a grate gave off a heartening warmth.  |p217Two  elaborate brass table lamps soon revealed the girl in red to the last detail , pitilessly betrayed the presence of paint on her cheeks and lips . " I 'm chilled right through . " Phoebe for the first time was speaking in her normal voice . " Is there anything ? " In silence Matt disappeared , returned bearing two small glasses and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then dropped heavily onto a chair . Phoebe he knew to be barely twenty years of age , yet wearing that absurd coiffure and clad in that outrageously decollete gown which revealedmore than concealed her bosom , she appeared to be years older . The girl settled herself near the fire and held out her hands to its warmth . Awkwardly , with his left hand he tossed her his handkerchief . " In Heaven 's name scrub off that dreadful paint . " Matt jumped up in anguish and for a while stood staring down at her , a tall figure silhouetted against the fireplace 's crimson glow . " During the past few months some evil things have happened to both of us . But you are not to be blamed that they happened  --  only I. " " Evil ? " She looked up from the fire at which she was warming her chilled hands . " In what way ? " " You have become a  --  a fancy woman , " he cried in a quivering voice , " and I a shameless traitor . Phoebe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patriots risking their very lives in a noble cause . I 've gambled , I 've whored and guzzled myself into drunkenness more often than I can remember . Oh , Abigail Hovey 's bastard son has become a fine specimen of manhood ! " The self-accusations poured from his lips in jerky , bitter sentences . To it all Phoebe listened round-eyed , with lips compressed and sitting bolt upright . " Ah , uh ,  --  what did you say you were , Mr. Everett ? " " Never mind . What tortures me most is , in effect , that I 'm responsible for your  --  transformation . " " You responsible , Matthew ? I  --  I do n't understand . How could you be responsible for what happened to me ? " He swallowed hard . " I 'll tell you . When I learned that my mother had been tricked by an illegal marriage ceremony , and that I , therefore , was illegitimate , I swore I would do three things . First , I 'd leave Dexter ; second , I 'd kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then I 'd hunt down the mock minister who had officiated . Do n't you remember that time in your mother 's kitchen when I told you I was leaving Dexter forever ? " " You told me you were going to leave ? " Phoebe repeated wonderingly , and her petticoats rustled softly when she shifted on her chair . " And what did I say to that ? " " You swore that you loved me . " His voice deepened in his wretched/ness . " You said that if I went away you would follow me , no matter where I went . " " I see . Then I was in love with you ? " she demanded gravely . " Were you in love with me ? " " I 've loved you , " he told her , " ever since you were a stork-legged little girl with long red pigtails . " " Oh . Then we were really promised , just as you said at the Planters Hotel ? " He flushed . " Well , I felt so and so did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so . " Forgetting his wound , Matt poked the fire , then straightened painfully . " You followed me , " he informed her , " how closely I do n't really know , but apparently Mrs. Wilber brought you to St. Louis still unconscious from an injury received in a wreck . You must have been struck on the head hard enough to make you lose your memory . So , " he urged in desperate earnestness , " always remember that you ca n't ever be held responsiblefor falling into Mrs. Wilber 's clutches  --  and her way of life . " " But  --  but , Matt . I did n't fall into her way of life ' as you say . " Infinite pain was in his eyes . " No ? Then why are you dressed like this  --  like a fancy girl ? " " I  --  I was friendless  --  desperate . Please , Matt  --  let me tell you what 's happened since I came or was brought to St. Louis . " While the fire crackled and snapped Phoebe talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . She pressed her temples as , forlornly , she concluded . " I  --  I hope you 'll believe me , Matt . I left Mrs. Wilber 's as soon as Loretta told me what was in store . Really I did . As for Major Tucker , when I met him tonight I had no place to stay , no money  --  and I was hungry . . . . A sibilant sigh escaped him . " I do believe you  --  despite appearances . But will anyone else ? Surely everyone there , the General , Colonel Buttons , Greenway and the rest would swear that you 're no better than Leonie , Loretta and those other fancy girls . " He stood up . " We 're leaving St. Louis as fast as we humanly can . By the first ferry tomorrow . I  --  I hate this city because of the disgraceful things I 've done and stood for . Ca n't get away fast enough . " Her dark blue eyes lingered on his strong , weather-beaten face . " So my name really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusedmonotone . " I come from a village in the State of Maine called Dexter . My father 's name is Azel and my mother 's is Nancy . " He smiled delightedly . " But I have n't told you your mother 's name . That 's come back of its own accord . Oh , Phoebe dear , let us pray God that before long you 'll remember everything before your accident . "  |p219A  knock sounded at the door and Lambert appeared , clutching a batteredstovepipe hat . " Yessuh ? You got errands fo ' me ? " From a billfold Matt counted out fifty dollars in crisp notes on the Exchange Bank of St. Louis . He said quietly but distinctly , " I know it will be difficult to carry out my instructions at this time of night but I want you to buy , I do n't care where , this young lady , a complete outfit of decent clothing . Understand , garments which must be plain and warm . " Lambert 's white-fringed head bobbed several times . " Yassuh . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over to Sixteenth Street lives a lady from Arkansaw what been sellin ' off her daughter 's clo'es . She runned off with a gambling man . " " Good ! " Matt once more was the Captain issuing orders . " One more thing . You 're to locate Mr. Daingerfield , he 's probably at Mrs. Wilber 's place : ' He winced . " Tell him he must meet me at our place of business tomorrow morning at seven o'clock sharp . Understand ? " Never had Lambert seen his master wear so grim an expression . He ducked his head several more times . " Yas , suh , yassuh . Ah 'll sho'nuff find Misto ' Daingerfield . Once the servant had shuffled out Phoebe rose , came sweeping forward , petticoats whispering under her wide hoop skirt . " What do you plan , Matthew ? I want , I need to know . I 'm so dreadfully confused . " " Tomorrow morning we will be married at the first possible moment , " he informed her gravely . " Then we leave St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what of you ? " He drew a deep breath . " I intend to leave everything I 've come by here to my partner  --  he 's the only loyal and good friend I 've found since leaving home . When we board that ferry I 'll have with me only the three hundred dollars I brought West with me . " " But you  --  are n't you abandoning a small fortune ? " He jerked a nod . " I suppose so , but it 's a tainted fortune  --  which I wish to play no part in our future . God willing , we shall live as decent , selfrespectingcitizens . " She peered up into his drawn features , then kissed him sweetly and whispered , " Where shall we go from here ? " " I do n't know for certain . Possibly to Cincinnati or Louisville . I heard recently that a man named Ellet is converting a number of Ohio River boats into steam rams . Perhaps I can find employment with him . " **26;8188;TOOLONG .

He examined each sentence carefully . Nothing definite was said . For a while he carefully pruned the time spent lingering around the doctors ' offices . He came home earlier . That night Ouida sought job . " How long have you known this was going on ? " she demanded . " God , the whole town knows it !

I 'm telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to tell me anything , " Ouida cried indignantly . " I guess I know children . I guess I know my own son ! " Gradually , Lucas resumed his day-long vigils .. As often as not , nowadays , he would be invited into the buggy to accompany the doctor into the country . He said little on these trips . He listened greedily . And the doctors , knowing why he was with them , talking obediently about the case they were jogging toward , about Medicine in general , about studyingMedicine , about the names of things . All of this Lucas now kept to himself . Sometimes he was so full with that which he had learned that he trembled with the excitement . His mother noticed and understood , but she never mentioned it . His father looked at him kindlily and winked . Lucas was full of love for both of them . " Ever see a carbuncle , Lucas ? " Dr. Alexander asked suddenly one day . He had just come out onto his porch and Lucas was waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hop in . " The doctor flopped the reins and they were off . " Now , I 'll tell you the difference between a boil and a carbuncle . Git up ! Now , do you know what a boil is ? " He waited expectantly . " A boil is an abscess . It starts in the skin . Microbes get into a sweat gland . They eat a pocket under the skin . The pocket gets swollen with pus . You got to cut through the skin to the pocket to let it out . " " That 's fine . That 's fine . " " And the most dangerous place for a boil is on the end of the nose or in the nostrils . When you poke around the microbes can get spread into the blood stream and maybe into the brain . You can die from a boil . " " That 's good . That 's fine . Now how about a carbuncle ? " Lucas looked at him helplessly , mortified . " A carbuncle is another name for boil . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a lot of channels  --  like a starfish . See ? " " Yes , sir . " " When a boil breaks  --  there 's one opening . When a carbuncle breaks there 's a lot of openings . " " How do you open a carbuncle ? " " Same way . You cut the skin down to the pocket . " " A cut shaped like an X. Two cuts . " " Fine . " " And people get boils from not eating the right foods , and from kidney trouble and diabetes and living in bad air . " " Not all of them at once . " " No , sir . " They rode a while in silence . " But you could have all of them at once ! " Lucas burst out . " You could . But not likely . " " You would n't be worrying about boils , then . " " That 's right . Git up ! " Far down the road a house came into view . The doctor pointed . " We 're going there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I 'm there I 'll take a look at the man . He 's got a carbuncle . Now pay attention . I 'm going to lance his carbuncle . Here 's what I 'm going to do . I 'm going to paint the area with iodine . I 'm going to lay wet gauze around where I 'm going to cut . I 'm going to cut . I 'm going to poke in a drain . Then I 'm going to put on a bandage . Do you understand ? " " Yes , sir . " " You 've got it clear ? " " Yes , sir . " " Fine . " The buggy had reached the house . The doctor stopped the horse . He got out . He reached for his bag . He looked at Lucas . " Well , come on , come on ! " Lucas stared at him , open-mouthed . " Come on , Luke ! " Lucas scrambled over the side of the buggy . The doctor held his bag toward him . Lucas grabbed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened immediately . The woman of the house smiled a wan greeting . The doctor stepped over the threshold . He turned to Luke , who stood waiting , holding the bag toward him . " Come on , son . Come on in , " Dr. Alexander said . There was no possiblechance of a mistake . He had said it , he had really said it . Numb with delight , Lucas entered the house . " My helper , " Doctor Alexander said courteously . Lucas looked at her anxiously . But the woman did not laugh . She only smiled a welcome and nodded . My helper ! It rang in Lucas ' ears . It thundered . The hairs at the back of his neck prickled . Stiff with pride he followed the doctor into the kitchen of the farmhouse . The doctor turned to the woman. 42 " Well , " he said , " guess we 'll go upstairs if you 're ready . " " All ready . " The woman turned obediently . The back door opened and the farmer clumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . " Hi , Doc , " he said , sideways . " Be right with you , " Dr. Alexander said . He gestured to Luke . " Brought my helper along . " The farmer promptly pulled out a chair and sett it near Lucas . " Sit down , " he said . " Glad to have you . " He , too , said it seriously , there was no mockery in it . There was in his manner that if the doctor saw fit to bring Lucas , the doctor knew what he was doing . All the tools of a doctor were mysterious . The boy was young , but the doctor had a reason for bringing him , and however it was the boy was going to help , the doctor knew best . " Set , " he adjured Lucas , smiling a welcome . And there was even a little respect in his tone . It was unmistakable . There was definitely respect . The farmer poured himself a cup of coffee , recollected , put the cup in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild moment of indecision Lucas took the coffee resolutely , following the pattern of maturitythe doctor had established for him . " Got boils . Got ' em bad ! " the farmer confided . Lucas swelled with pride at the confidence . " That so ? " he said guardedly . " Got ' em bad . " " Boils can be pretty serious . " " So I heard . " Lucas nodded . They drank their coffee in silence . The doctor came downstairs . He entered the kitchen briskly . The man stood up . " Well , Charley , might as well get started ! " " Okay , Doc . How 's the missus ? " " She 'll be all right . Going to have to operate one of these days . I think that cyst 's getting bigger . Big as an orange , now . " He turned to Lucas . " Uterine cyst , " he said politely . " Probably quite a few adhesions . " Right in front of the farmer . " Yes , sir , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you want me to do , Doc ? " " You just sit in a chair , any of these kitchen chairs 'll do nicely . Sit facingthe back . Did you boil some water , Luke ? " Lucas ' world collapsed . " No , " he said , ashamed to his depths . " I  --  " " Does n't matter . We 'll flame the knife . " He looked about him . " Now  --  my bag  --  " Lucas rushed for it . He brought it to the table , opened it , stood aside . The farmer watched interestedly . But now Lucas was almost unconscious of the farmer 's presence . Now he was committed to do what the doctor required , to the job in hand . Now he and the doctor were one , a unit , speaking the same language , apart , and this man was a stranger . He was43animate tissue which was to be treated thus and so , for which a part of one 's consciousness must be reserved , a small part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supplications the tissue might utter , and this part would deal with these manifestations mechanically , making the conventional sounds of sympathy and reassurance . The doctor unfolded a clean towel and put it on the table . Lucas watched intently . He was memorizing each action so that he might do it next time . When the towel was opened the doctor laid upon it a lancet . Then he brought from the hag an alcohol lamp and assembled it . Lucas quickly went to the stove and brought back a match . The doctor nodded . Lucas ritually lit the lamp . Next from the bag came a small vial and a long curved tweezers . In the vial were three twists of gauze covered with vaseline . Now came a vial of iodine , a small heap of snowy gauze squares . Now the doctor was ready . There was a pause . The doctor looked at the back of the farmer 's neck . Looked clown at the array of materiel on the towel . He looked at Lucas . Lucas breathed quickly . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I 'm going to open this carbuncle for you  --  it 's going to hurt a little . " " Ca n't hurt worse , " the farmer said stolidly . " Maybe I better freeze it . . . " The doctor hesitated . " Do n't worry about me , " the farmer assured him . " Do n't want you jumping around  --  " The farmer gripped his hands tighter . " I 'll set ! " he promised . The doctor made up his mind . He returned to the open bag , brought forth a fat tube with a nozzle at one end . " I 'm going to freeze it , " he said to Lucas . " Yes , sir , " said Lucas confidently . He did not know what was about to happen but he strove to put all the approval he possessed into his answer . The doctor now carefully and slowly removed the soiled bandage which had concealed the carbuncle . For the first time Lucas saw that which they were to treat . His assurance left him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fled thinly , left him a small boy gaping at the back of a human neck on which an ugly inflamed lump the size of a monstrous marble presented itself . Lucas fought the shock of aversion which had made him look down at the towel as if there were something there which interested him more . He forced himself to look at the carbuncle again . " That 's a bad one , " Dr. Alexander said . He swabbed the region with iodine . He looked at Lucas appraisingly . " You see  --  the infection entered a pore hereabouts , worked its way down to a sebaceous gland  --  and here 's the result . " Lucas ' mind seized gratefully on this planned distraction . He now looked at the carbuncle steadfastly . It was really a neck , just like anybody else 's . The doctor placed wet gauze pads around the boil . Now everythinglooked better . A germ had gotten into a pore and the pus and inflammationbeneath the surface had raised the skin on this part of the neck , forced it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blood , the same blood that made the man 's skin pink , only a lot of it , a lot of it in one place . The doctor lifted the fat glass tube and held it two inches from the carbuncle . His thumb pressed down on the handle back of the nozzle . There was a hissing noise . A thin , fine stream sprayed the huge carbuncle . The inflamed red had become white . Soon the entire carbuncle was frosty white . The doctor put down the tube . " Now it 's frozen , " he said . He waited , picked up the tube again , resumed spraying . " Light the lamp . " Lucas hurriedly seized the match , struck it , held it to the lamp wick . Blue flame appeared . He stared at it , fascinated . " Pick up the lancet . " Lucas looked at the doctor , then obediently picked up the lancet . " Hold it in the flame . " Lucas held the knife uncertainly over the flame . " Just the cutting end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With infinite care , Lucas did as he was bid . " Now hand it to me  --  hold it by the middle  --  do n't touch the end  --  put the handle in my fingers  --  " With his other hand the doctor put down the tube . " Ethyl chloride , " he said . He turned back to the man 's neck . " Now  --  you see  --  " He cut down on the swelling . The white tissue parted promptly , gaped like a thin pair of white lips . " And now  --  " And he cut down at right angle , a cross of gaping white lips . Lucas swallowed , his eyes glowed with excited admiration . The doctor cut again , deepening each incision . Suddenly there boiledup in each slash thick , ropy , greenish-yellow pus . An instant later the white , the snowy carbuncle , no more human than snow , was red withdark blood , the blood and pus mixed , a thick , soupy blood coiling sluggishlyout to the surface , spreading . A gush of black-green-yellow followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look away . " Hand me the pads  --  " Lucas stared on . The doctor turned his head to look at him . " The pads  --  " He pointed to the gauze squares . Lucas looked numbly at the pads . He forced himself to take one , to put it in the doctor 's waiting hand . " More ! More pads ! " He seized more . He handed them up . The doctor was wiping away the exudate . It flowed on . Soon there were no more pads . " There 's more in my bag . Hurry ! " Lucas wrenched his limbs into movement . He walked to the bag . He looked down into its black mouth . His head began to reel . A spasm of nausea sickened him . The bag blurred . " In the left hand corner  --  " The doctor 's voice was cold , commanding , his hand went automaticallyinto the left corner , his fingers felt gauze , he brought up a handful44 - 45 , **25;8216;TOOLONG pads . The doctor took three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Hold them in place ! " Lucas looked at the doctor helplessly . The doctor took one of his limp hands . He placed it on the gauze . Gingerly , reluctantly , Lucas put up his other hand , pressed his fingers on the rest of the gauze . He waited , standingdizzily , averting his eyes . " Feeling better ? " The doctor had stepped around to face the farmer , peering up into his face . " Fine , " the farmer said stolidly . " Did n't hurt much , did it ? " " Beginning to hurt a little now . " " Almost done . " The wife walked into the kitchen . " Glad I had my assistant here , " the doctor said cheerfully . Lucas straightened . The appeal was irresistible . He began to endure what was to be endured , resolutely . Now he forced himself to look full upon the oozing carbuncle , the stained gauze , his own fingers . He felt the farmer 's neck beneath the gauze . " All right  --  " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers on the gauze . Lucas stood aside . " Now we 'll sec if we can get a little more out . " He pressed down as he said this . Another spoonful of the thick stuff squeezed out and overlaid the gauze . This time Lucas had three more pads waiting before the doctor removed those that were drenched . The doctor smiled at him . " Hand me the drains  --  in that vial there  --  and the tweezers  --  " The room was still spinning , but the woman had moved beside themto watch and Lucas kept his eyes on the carbuncle with such a surge ofwill that he felt the will and his own determination and not the impactof what his eyes were set upon . The doctor placed a drain in one of theapertures he had cut , thrusting it deep into the neck with the tweezers . There was a small groan from the farmer . Lucas started . The woman looked at him . He controlled himself . " Almost done , " the doctor said abstractedly . On a square of gauze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the two strips of adhesive , laid them over the gauze , pressed the ends on the man 's neck . " Done ! " he said . The woman began to clean up . The lancet and the tweezers , the unused gauze , the bottles and vials went quickly back into the bag . The farmer stood up . He still held his neck gingerly awry . " Feels a lot better , " he said . " I 'll be back in a few days , change the dressing . " The doctor snapped the bag shut , handed it to Lucas . " Can I get you a cup of coffee ? Piece of pie ? " " Not a thing , " said the doctor . " Piece of pie for your helper ? " They all looked at Lucas. 46 " No  --  " the doctor smiled  --  " we 've got to get on . Save a piece for him , for next time . " They walked to the door , there was a small mirror in the hall and Lucas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismay that it was quite pale . Then they were in the buggy , homeward bound . " Was n't so bad , was it ? " the doctor said . Lucas did not answer . Around them the fields stretched , the world was a prosaic field , humdrum , meaningless , exasperating . That which really mattered , the most exciting stuff of which life could be fashioned , that which was all-absorbingand all-meaning , they were driving away from , it was in that farmhouse , in the kitchen , the bag opened , the instruments emerging , a carbuncleabout to be opened . Lucas looked adoringly at Dr. Alexander . " I should have had the water hot , " he said humbly . " Next time  --  " Next time . . . . There was to be a next time . . . His eyes filled . " Yes , sir , " he said . Existence was cored by those two words . He said them quietly to himself , testing the sweet anguish . His heart beat faster . Next time . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When school was over he burst into a world in which this day might be the day , he raced to Dr. Alexander 's , he sat on the steps . He waited day after day . Each day opened happier , more excited than the drab day fled . Next time . Perhaps tomorrow . There was another boil , soon , another carbuncle , there was a cut sewn , there was gunshot removed , a torn scalp , an amputated finger . There was next time . There was another next time . There were days and weeks and months of next times . And Lucas ' life was a patient waiting , a fulfillment , a waiting again . This was the stuff on which his clays were fed . This was his hunger . This was his necessity . This activity of Hominidae was for him its prime activity and all the rest were corollary , this was his meaning and his whole desire and his purpose . This had been so from his beginning . The minor surgeries neither awakened nor quickened him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas Marsh , a named mechanism of cells in which by accident or design this hunger was the summed and ordered craving of the cells themselves . On this day , riding through the countryside with his father , he groped for words to bridge the alien terrain between them , words with the reassurance and the bridging of love . He sat thinking of what he should say , thrilled to be taken for a ride with his father , sensible that his father did not idly invite him for a ride but would sooner or later say something which would make the purpose of the invitation clear . And job , for all his bland and breezy and confidentdismissal of Luke 's excitement about Medicine , had determined to create , from time to time , prudent opportunities in which to point out the excellences of his own way of life , the charm of it , its excitement , its sterling worth. 47 " Looks like we 're going to have a good year , " he confided . " That 's fine ! " Lucas was hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-thousand-dollar mortgage on the Tyre store yesterday . " Job grinned . Lucas belabored his small wits for a reply to show he understood . " That 's wonderful . " " I should so say , " Job chuckled . " I should so say so , " chimed Lucas. job 's face sobered . " Now I 'm going to slap another mortgage on it . " Lucas looked up , astonished . " Yep ! Gon na slap another right back on ! " Job was pleased with the boy 's amazement . " Does n't that mean going back into debt , Father ? " " That 's right , son ! " ' ' But you just got out  --  ! " " And now I 'm going right hack in ! " They rode a while in silence . Lucas was troubled . " Do n't get it , do you ? Remember this all your life , Luke . " He put his hand on the boy 's knee . " When I get out of debt it means I 'm free  --  free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody try to get out of debt ? " " We 're not everybody . We 're you and See ? Now , I 'm going to borrow six thousand dollars more from the bank . And I 'll have to pay them six percent for the use of it . Now if I ca n't turn around and make eight percent on the six thousand , why , I better quit , see ? I 'm just no businessman . " " Yes , father , " Lucas said dully . Ile had heard a lot about that **26;8243;TOOLONG from his mother , he had heard her worry and It-et over it , and here was his father , just as his mother had predicted , plunging in all over again . " You can get eight percent and more on any good farm mortgage . Nothing safer than a farm mortgage . " " Yes , Father . " " Money 's just a thing , Luke . It 's only merchandise , like ally other merchandise . Do n't save it . Make it ! Keep staking new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I put it out to sell . That 's all money is. just like har-ness . " " But everybody saves money ! " " No , no . Saving just means do n't waste it . Do n't throw it away any niore'n you would harness . But do n't go sticking it away in a box down the cellar where it ca n't do any good , like sticking it in a bank . Get it out where it can work  --  make more for you . Never forget that . Do n't pay any attention to people . People are stupid . Mob-stupid . When they do somethinglong enough they make a rule about it and when they 've got it all down pat and a lot of people do it then they call it smart and respecta-ble . " " How about the people that are always in debt and never have any money ? Those people , Dad ? " " You ca n't tell . Luck is what was hound to happen only you didn'tfigure on it . 1 ' 11 tell you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell you the truth about people . Nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand are full of ambition and drive . Pay no attention to them . Those are sidewise people . They push out sidewise . Any human 's got just so much drive . These people got so many ambitions there is n't drive enough to cover them . So all their efforts are little efforts . They whoosh out -- sideways . . . " They drove a while in silence . " You see , Luke ? " " Yes , Dad . " Lucas wondered how he summed up to his father . " They 'll never get anyplace . They just sit there like vegetables . Sidewayspeople . The most of the human race . Salt of the earth . Voting for people on the chance who they vote for will lead them somewhere . Workingfor each other , talking , making rules which say the kind of life they lead is the right one . " " They make the rules ? " " That 's their consolation prize . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not many of them . But you be one . " " Yes , Father . " " The one-track fellows . The Morgans , the Rockefellers , the Carnegies . The ones that 're born knowing . 1 mean  --  how things are . They see what to go after . Whatever it is  --  what a man  --  one of then  --  has to have . They put everything else out of mind . And they do n't think anything else . And they do n't sleep anything else . And they do n't eat anything else . Other people ? They just hear them far off , dimly , a kind of bleat that do n't mean anything . They know what life is . They know ! " " They fail , though . Some of them do . " " You 've been listening to your mother , son . Your mother is a fine woman . But she do n't know much about life . She thinks she does . And we 'll never tell her different . But life is life , Luke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's something else , some game or something . Those people do n't fail . Not ever . What they 're working on fails . They keep right on a-going . They never stop . All the rest  --  the herd  --  are sideways . They 're straight up . Now there it is , Lucas . It 's plain . It 's simple . You 've got to see it . You 've got to see it now ! You 've got to forget the rest . You 've got to get . That 's your only hope . People are nice . But they just do n't matter . " Now Luke knew there was a world of the flesh and a world of the spirit . He knew this . He knew it well . There was his father 's world and there was his mother 's world . He wanted with all his heart to please them both , to be on their side , in their world , to he what they wanted him to be . He tried diligently to show them that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never be what they wanted him to be , not if he tried forever . It was impossible . There was no doctor in their worlds . And in his world there was nothing else . One day he would listen to job , straining to appear beguiled while Job tried cunningly to enchant him with the fun of business , smiling brightly , hoping his father was happy with him . Or he would listen earnestly , in the same hour , to Ouida while she spoke and gestured lovingly to him of the future she knew was his . " Mother 's got great dreams for you , Lucas . Great , great visions . " She half closed her eyes . " I see you a leader among men , a mighty leader , a leader of the spirit , upward , upward , ever upward . " He would frown earnestly , so that she could see he was following every word . " A great artist , perhaps  --  " And he would nod quickly , hopefully . . . " A great musician . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , then nod more briskly than before . . . " The world  --  the whole world bowing down to you " He would lower his head to show that despite this he was modest as Mother would have him be . And all the while , with Job or with Ouida , he knew , he knew himself , he knew what he was , he was sick with the sense of having failed them , of tricking them , of acting , of leading a secret life . He thought surely they must read his mind for the very weight and clearness of his guilt . Sometimes they found him out . He was eight when Ouida discovered his hoard of bottles and the fascinating refuse he collected back of the drugstore . " Do n't you want me to tidy these up ? " she asked evenly . She smiled at him sweetly with her eyes and mouth . " No , thank you , Mother . No , do n't . Do n't bother . " His face flamed with shame and embarrassment . He hugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the day to show that he loved her , that she must n't be hurt . But he kept the rubbish . He moved the magic bottles , the empty boxes , to another place . And she did not look for them again . When he was eleven Job opened by mistake a package addressed to Lucas and found a glorious , shining new book on anatomy for which he had saved nearly two years ' allowance . " I did n't mean to open it , Lucas , " he said apologetically , handing the book to the boy in its torn wrappings , " I never thought of anything being for you  --  in the mail  --  " And Lucas had taken it quickly , burning with guilt , ashamed to look at his father . He fled with it , lest his mother come in and discover it also . There were no reproaches . And he knew they looked at each other with understanding , patiently waiting , waiting for a change he knew would never , never come . He was a lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched other children playing , bewildered at their raptures . He lived his life alone . It was another life . He read hungrily . The doctors saved for him the medicalliterature and advertisements that flooded their mail . These he read over and over , saving them lovingly , fingering them , deciphering them . In study periods he would stand at the big dictionary in the corner , hunting , hunting , reading absorbedly , now sidetracked by some new word , now consulting the list of medical words he had copied laboriously on a slip of paper , words in the pamphlets , in the medical bulletins . Sometimeswhen there would be a word the dictionary did not contain hewould ask one of the doctors for the meaning . Sometimes he would be ashamed to ask , lest they remember suddenly that he was a child and withdraw their favor . At the same time a new cosmos had enveloped him . His tastes had becomesuddenly keener . Foods he liked he became inordinately fond of . He discovered a strangeness , a sharp newness , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark of a tree , his fingers explored cloth , paper , iron , all the substances he encountered , for the feel they would reveal , and all these things were a great strangeness in the commonplace , a great newness , a new dimension . Then odors , the odors of cooking , his mother 's few scents , the smells of cloths , of leather , the smell of a skunk ; he analyzed them , he weighed them , he worried them , why did they smell as they smelled , why did they feel as they felt ? And he stared at them more sharply and brooded and looked long and hard . And they were different . Sights , smells , touches , tastes , these were the substancesof the world about him , important and relevant and new . And as for sound , his heart beat to the sound of a doctor 's horse clip-clopping up the street to the porch on which he waited ; and the miracle sound , the beatitude , the clink of an instrument . He did well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other children . He was liked and pitied . Adults found him quiet , well behaved , abstracted . " What are you going to be someday ? " they would ask brightly . And if his father was with him he would look at his father . " He 's got a lot of time for that , " Job would say confidently . " I guess we wo n't be too far apart , eh , son ? " And he would put his arm about Lucas . And if his mother was with him , Lucas would look down . " He has n't made up his mind yet , " Ouida would smile . She would look at him serenely , confidently . She would smile . And Lucas would smile too . And if he was with both of them , he would say nothing and they would say nothing , merely wait for him to reply . And in the silence the visitor would laugh heartily and delightedly , and clap him on the shoulder . " Bet you 'd like to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboy ! How 's that , now ! A cowboy ! " When the war ended , Job owned the four stores ; there was , to be sure , a mortgage on each . But there was money in the bank , there was a new home , there was comfort and even the beginnings of luxury . Job bought a shining Winton . " Do n't worry you , Mr. 1VIarsh ? " a townsman would ask slyly . " Me ? Like cows worried when margarine was invented ! This thing ? Peopie 'll buy ' em , of course . Like to sell me any your horses cheap ? " " I guess there 'll be horses a while . " " I guess there will be . Not more'n a million years or so . " " Yep . " " Or as the Frenchman says : Palm de tare  --  and likewise  --  gross de toot ' ! . . . CHAPTER 6But there were times in school when he was lonely . There were times when he felt keenly the differences between himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was never a time when he would have exchanged his life and its meanings for theirs but now and again he wished that his mother was more like other mothers and that his father and mother were more like other paired members of the tribe about him . It was during one of these lonely periods that Lucas came home from school very late one day , late and sweaty and dirty . " They want me for track ! " he cried . " I 'm supposed to come out for the track team ! " " Well , good ! " Job rose and clapped his shoulder . " What track ? " demanded Ouida , furious and bewildered . " I want some track shoes ! Good leather ones ! " Lucas cried . " Guess we should n't have any trouble in the leather line , " job saidcomfortably . " Do n't be so intense , Lucas ! You 're too intense ! " Ouida frowned . " I used to be quite a runner myself . " Job grinned . " What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-mile ! Coach says 1 ' 11 make a quarter-miler . But I like the half . " Ouida listened to this suddenly established rapport between job and her son with dismay and alarm . She forced a set smile . " When did you ever run ! " she scoffed . " Oh , I used to run around the farm . I ran faster than anybody . Every time there was a church ruckus I used to get in all the races . Won ' em all . Every one . " " Every one ! " " That 's right . " " Did you like to run distances , Dad ? " " Sprints or distances  --  it was all the same to me . Won ' em all . " Later , Ouida came into the living room , where Lucas sat studying . She sat down beside him . " I want to talk to you a while . " He searched his mind guiltily . " Yes , Mother . . . " I have been to see your principal , Mr. Prescott . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aptitude , Lucas . But you wo n't apply yourself  --  " " I 'm all right , Mother  --  " " You 're a dreamer , Lucas : That 's what he says . When you should be studying you dream . You have no application . " " I got 94 in Latin  --  I got 86 in  --  " " You like those things ! You like Latin , you 're like myself , I love languages ! I could be a great language scholar , I would love to know 52them all  --  you like French , you like history . But you do n't even bother to study them . " " Now , Mother ! I got 94  --  " " You could have gotten a hundred . " " A hundred ! " " There 's absolutely no reason why you could not have gotten a hundred . The child I carried in my body , the little life I carried underneath my heart and bore in agony  --  " Lucas twisted . " Not under your heart , Mother . In your  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Under my heart , Lucas . " " Yes , Mother . " " You 're going away from me , Lucas . I feel it . You 're drifting farther and farther away . " " Do n't say that  --  " " I can feel it . . " It 's not true ! It 's just not true ! " " The little boy I knew and loved  --  " " I 'm here , Mother ! " " I have to tell you this , Lucas . I have to tell you the truth . I wo n't alwayshe here to guide you . I 'll be gone , someday , Lucas . I 'll be dead . Mother will be dead . You 'll be alone . " Her face was lifted to his a little . Her lips were open . Tears streamed down her cheeks . " Will you miss me , Lucas ? " He threw himself on his knees beside her , his arms tight around her , his face pressed against her bosom , his eyes shutting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't  --  do n't , Mother ! Do n't ! Please . . . Please do n't ! . . . She caressed his head gently , her hands passing over his hair . She gazed off into the distance . " I 've got to tell you , Lucas . " She began to sob a little , helplessly . " You 've got to see . . . " " I 'll try , Mother . Do n't die . Be with me . . . " You 're all I 've got , Lucas . " " I 'll be good . I 'm sorry , please  --  " " And now games , Lucas . Now it 's something else to take your mind off your studies . My Lucas ! My boy playing children 's games . You  --  with your mind , your fine mind that I gave you . . . " I 'll stop  --  " " Games are not for Lucas . Kangaroo shoes . And yelling . Leave those things for the clods . They do n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave you . I wo n't always be here , Lucas . I 'll be dead and gone . I 'll be far away . You 'll be lonely . Then you 'll see . Then it 'll be too late  --  too late . . . " He clung to her harder , the tears flowed faster , he could not stop them . He loved her , he knew what she was doing , and he could not stop . At length she forced a laugh . " Look at us , " she cried . " Two boobies sitting here crying ! " 53She pressed him away to look at his face , to drink his tears . He averted his eyes . He put her hand to his cheek . " What is it you want , Lucas ? What do you really want to be ? " He hesitated . " Whatever you say , Mother . " " No , let 's talk ! You and Mother ! Tell me . Tell me truly . Tell me from your heart . " He sighed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I want to be a doctor . " " A doctor ! You really want to be a doctor , Lucas ? " He twisted helplessly . " That 's what you still really want  --  in your heart of hearts ? " " I ca n't help it . I 'll do whatever you say . But you asked me . You told inc to say  --  " " Have you sat by yourself and concentrated and let the Divine Light pour through you in all its great and mighty shining waves ? " " I 've tried , Mother . I 've tried and tried  --  " " You 're a very old soul , Lucas . Mother is a very old soul too . We go back , back , back into time , we two , back to the Pyramids . . . . 1 was a priestess once , a Princess in Egypt  --  " Lucas swallowed . She turned her face slowly . Her eyes were grave . She smiled with her mouth . " If that 's really what you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not breathing . " If you have searched your soul and asked Almighty God for His guidance . . . " She waited as if listening . She nodded . " So be it . I do not know why or how , for their wisdom is beyond me . My guides have spoken . Now I know . You will be a doctor . " He stared at her , white-faced , not believing , holding his breath . " You will tell your father that you will not need those  --  track shoes ! " " Oh , yes , Mother ! Yes ! Yes ! " " And you will study ? You will apply yourself ? In the things you do n't like as well as the things you do ? " " I 'll make a hundred in math ! Medicine 's full of math ! They use it for everything ! X-rays , physics , chemistry  --  everything ! " She rose , uplifting him with her . She kissed his cheek . He kissed her and she turned her head barely in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can go to bed now . You 've studied long enough . Your face is tired . " " No , no ! " He sat down quickly . " Now I 've got to study . Now I 've got to really study . Now you 'll see . " " There are no limits for you , Lucas . You can be the greatest man in the world . " " Yes , Mother . " He flung himself upon his books. 54In the kitchen , after she had carefully closed the door , she stood still , her hands folded . After a time she twisted her shoulders stiffly , moved to the kitchen table , sat down . She picked up a book on reincarnation . She began to read . When she looked up , hearing Job come home , an hour had passed . She heard him enter , heard Lucas call to him , heard his excited young voice telling his father the news . She heard Job exclaim . His voice was mechanical . Her face hardened . She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Job entered the kitchen . His face was white with anger . " What the hell do you think you 're doing ! " he demanded furiously . " Were you by chance referring to me ? " Ouida asked icily . " It 's not necessary to shout . " " Did you tell that boy he could be a doctor ? " " If you are referring to Lucas  --  my son  --  " " Your son ! A poor thing like you ! You happened to have a belly to breed him in . I 'm surprised you had that , I 'm  --  " " Moderate your voice , " Ouida said shakily . " You 're a lunatic , that 's what you are . You ought to be put away ! You and your crystal balls and your spirits . Now you leave that boy alone or I ' 11 " You 'll what ! " " I 'm warning you , now  --  " " Who are you  --  a lout like youl  --  to say that fine boy shall or shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead set against it as me . Where do you get off all of a sudden to  --  " " He 's my son and I know him through and through . I know him as you can never hope to know him . I bore him . I know his every thought . He wants to be a doctor . I 've looked into his eyes when he told me so . I do n't expect an animal like you to do anything but scoff at the fine things , the things you can never understand . And I say if he wants to be a doctor that 's what he 's going to be . Now just exactly what do you think you 're going to do about it ? " " You 've got the world all doped out , have n't you , Ouida . Do you know people laugh at you ? They always have , you know . You 're a big joke . They snicker behind your back . Half the town thinks you 're crazy . They 're sorry for me . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they think of you . I 'm married to you . I 've got to put up with a certain amount of your pretending you 're better than anyone else , and your crystal balls and your quarrelling with the very food a man eats . Because I have the damned bad luck to be married to you . That 's all right . I married you with my eyes open . You were a halfwit then , and nobody 'd have you and I knew it and I married you . But do n't get the idea that because I let you get away with it that that gives you the right to say what a boy 's whole future is going to be . Do n't ever get that idea . " " You married me ! Oh , when I think what I 've done , what I 've done ! " " You 've done pretty well , if you ask me ! " " Ask you ! Why would anyone ever ask you anything ? You 're a liar and every human that knows you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thief . You 're an animal . There is n't a spark of human decencyin you . You 're filth . Pure , human filth . You came from filth , you live in filth , and you 'll die in it . Do n't you ever tell me what people say . This whole town knows you , Job Marsh . And despises the ground you walk on . " " That 's how everybody is to you . The whole human race . That 's that dreamworld you live in . Suit yourself . You live where you please . Just leave that boy alone . " " So he can grow up like his father ? And someday rip a decent girl like an animal on her wedding night ? So he can steal a store from an honestold man that befriended him ? So he can grow up an ignorant swine who ca n't live unless he lies and steals from decent people ? That 's your world , is it ? " " It 's kept a roof over your head and bought Ouija @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ashamed . You go ahead , go your own way . Just keep your nonsense to yourself . Do n't infect him . Do n't try to pull that stuff on him that this world is a spiritual place to live in . Becauseyou 're all alone , Ida Boorgoys ! The world knows better . And he 's going to amount to something in the world . Not your world . Not the lunatic asylum . Leave him alone , you bitch , you dumb excuse for a woman . Or 1 'll have you locked up . Committed ! " " You 'll have me locked up  --  ! " " I 'm warning you  --  ! " " I ) o you know what would happen if I ever opened my mouth about you ? Do you know ? " They were both shouting now , careless and alone . Ouida 's face was death-white . Her eyes glittered . Her voice had become hoarse . Job studiedher , uncertain . " I 'm just telling you , now Ouida  --  I 'm warning you  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . She spat in his face . " You 'll warn ME ! You ! You degenerate dog ! " Trembling , unnoticed , Lucas entered the kitchen . " I 've had enough ! " Job roared . His fist crashed into Ouida 's mouth . She fell sprawling . Her hand crept , dazed , to her lips . A bloody tooth dropped into her fingers . " Father ! " wailed Lucas . He rushed at Job to hold him . His father struck him out of his way with a sweep of his arm , without turning his head from Ouida . " Lay there ! " he snarled . He looked at her with raging satisfaction . Then he strode from the room . Lucas knelt beside his mother . " I 'm glad you saw , " she said thickly . Blood poured from her lips . " Now you saw . Now you know what I 've had to put up with . Now you saw for yourself . " He tried to help her rise . " Get away from me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel , wet it , rushed back to her . She struck it wildly from his hand . " I 've had enough ! " she screamed . " I 've had enough too ! I 've had enough of all of you . " She ran coughing to the sink . She began to vomit . Lucas watched , desperate , withered , sick with pity , guilty , longing to escape , impotent , alone . There had never been anything like this . Alwaysbefore he had had a secret sympathy for his father , a resentment for his own embarrassment at his mother 's naked rages . Sometimes he and his father had looked at each other covertly . But this , this was too unlooked for to be believed . He shrank from both of them , his bonds with them ripped , the breach stuffed with shame ; adrift in a world which peered and listened and must know all , In the days that followed Job did not speak to Ouida and only in rare monosyllables to Lucas . When he noticed them at all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He left the house quickly and came home late . He enveloped himself in the harness shops . He worked fiercely and resolutely . He devoted himself to repair the breach in his defenses , in the wall of his world , to thrust out his home , his wife and his son , these aliens and their alien problems . The revelation that they had somehowinsensibly gathered power to penetrate his world , to influence and disrupt it , amazed and frightened him . He was aghast at himself and angry and he cursed bitterly the undefended highway in his life over which these intruders had marched to assault him . He must never let this happen again . As to Ouida , Job knew best how to retaliate . The quarrel had freed him . He was free with a new freedom . He was free , now , to plan as he chose , to maneuver , to consult no one . He wondered , alarmed , how many opportunities he had missed . The family fortunes were comparatively stable . Rather than risk scenes Job had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this career they represented , hardly taxed his capacities . He surveyed himself with disgust and anger . He unleashedhimself , his thoughts leaped the safe ramparts and quested for spoil . It was at this time that he made plans to buy four other harness stores , one a very large establishment in the city of Meridian . It was outrageous , it occurred to him a moment , and in another moment he was launched upon it . The Meridian store was imposing . Its history was troubled . No one had been able to make it pay . This was almost the greatest challenge life could offer Job , and the best loved . He plunged into assaults on the owners . Now he was himself again , and now the shy animal that had won the planet , whose cells had evolved in conquest and flight , was pure in him , simple and entire . And the planet was his prey and everything that existedupon it . And time and the moment were willows to weave in a trap . That was the simple business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was not so . Job smiled happily . He lived three days in Meridian . He fastened upon the Derickson brothers who owned the store , he whittled at them remorselessly . He lied tremendous lies , simple lies , confusing lies , exciting lies , and lies so complicatedonly he could unravel them . Also , sometimes he told the truth . It was all one . Late at night , when he reluctantly left them , he went out into the streets , still exhilarated , pent , and sleepless . In a bar was a streetwalker , he was delighted , he made for her directly , he grinned obscenitiesin her ear and she smiled at him and he hugged her , exultant , the bartenderfrowned at him and job grinned wider , he and the whore were wed by that frown , Job sighed and grinned wider . Now the drinking began . Next morning he left her to go directly to the Dericksons . He was renewed . He plunged avidly into his unlikely battle to split the Dericksons , to twist them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enticethem into surrendering their property to him at a price so low that Job himself smiled fiercely at the audacity and the possibility of it all . In the evening his whore was waiting for him again . He wallowed with her gloriously and rose as before to return to the assault and the siege on the Dericksons . Toward noon of the third day he resolved to return to Milletta . He was happy . He had spent a fulfilling time . He relaxed . He prepared to say his farewells . An hour later he very suddenly won . He was completely surprised . Once again he had won by his wits and his wits alone , but this time the stakes were larger and sobering . Relatively small as the purchase price was , the sum was still huge , the property involved was larger than anything he had ever owned . To raise the money he would have to put second mortgages on the four stores , borrow on everything he owned . Now a new battle began , in which he persuaded the owners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave them a check for the balance . He rushed home to raise the amount and deposit it before the check was presented for payment . A few moments with Charley , his helper , borrowed the old man 's life savings  --  that was four hundred dollars , and from a salesman come on a regular selling visit he borrowed three hundred more . He was irresistible , his momentum hurled him faster , he went to merchants , to farmers ; before the banking day ended he had raised within a thousand dollars of an amount large enough to encourage the bank to allow him an overdraft . For the final thousand dollars he forged Ouida 's name to a note secured by four vacant lots her father had left her . Job walked out of the bank , stable and serene , out into the world , his world now , a new world , a new man . He paused briefly at the shop , it had dwindled , become in three days a little shabby , a poor thing . One of eight . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpectedly . " Me ? Oh , I do n't think I 'd better do that . Thanks all the same  --  " " Go on . Go ahead . " " Well . . . I 'd as soon not . . . I  --  " " Got an interest in the business , now , eh ? " " I want to thank you again , Mr. Marsh . I do n't know how to put it , I guess it do n't mean much to a man like you  --  but letting me invest that four hundred dollars  --  " " That 's all right , Charley . No need for thanks . You earned the privilege . Fair 's fair . . . " Job Marsh went home . He had not changed his shirt , his socks , or his underwear in four days . He was beginning to feel grubby and uncomfortable . While he had been gone Ouida had been happy . She was indifferent58to his whereabouts . That he had simply dropped out of her world did not bother her at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself , the house was free from tension , she was free , completely free , to do as she pleased . The possibility that Job might never return did not occur to her . He had become like an illness to which she was subject . She knew she would have it always . She assented to this illness . She knew how much of her life was sacrificed to it . She was determined only to preserveher spare life in the pursuit of that which kept her whole and which was the only world that really mattered . Her first intimation of Job 's departure came a few hours after he left Milletta to go to Meridian . There was a knock at the door and Charley looked at her , troubled . She hid her still-bruised mouth with her hand . " Fellow wants to see Mr. Marsh , " he said . " Thought he might be here . " " Has n't he been to the shop at all ? " " Oh , sure . He up and left and I thought  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Took the rig  --  " He was gone , then . She relaxed . She ' smiled happily , gaily , keeping her face half averted to hide her bruises . " Guess we 'll just have to expect him when we see him . " " Guess so . Thought you might know . . . Got a toothache , Miz Marsh ? " " I 'm afraid so . I was getting ready to go to the dentist . " " Well ... " He 'll be back , Charley . " " Yes , ma'am . " She closed the door . She stood savoring her freedom . The freedom grew , swelled in her , she was intoxicated with happiness . She ran to the kitchen , put away the basin from which she had been putting hot cloths to her face . She rushed upstairs to change her clothes . In the midst of her dressing she smelled something burning . She rushed downstairs again , gazed wildly about the kitchen . Smoke was eddying slowly from the oven door . She wrenched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had forgottena bread pudding . A fit of coughing overcame her and she sank into a chair , gasping for breath , powerless . Recovering a little , she fumbledthe back door open , leaned against the doorpost . The fresh air revivedher . Still coughing , she turned back , snatched up one of the wet cloths she had been using , covered her mouth and nose and ran unsteadilyto the open oven . She dragged forth the burning pudding , threw itin the sink . She turned on the water . She stumbled to the door again , rested a moment , sat down on the back steps . The smoke cleared . She went upstairs and finished dressing . She continued to cough a little . Her throat felt raw . She mixed salt and water , gargled , put on a hat , muffled the lower part of her face in a scarf , and set out for the dentist 's office . " I had a fall . " She laughed remorsefully . " I see you did , Mrs. Marsh , " he said expressionlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have a new tooth for you in a jiffy . " He peered closer . " Got kind of a sore throat there , have n't you ! " 59 " I guess this was bound to be a bad day . Burned a bread pudding . The whole house was full of smoke . I must have swallowed enough for a county . " " Pretty red , all right . . . . Now , there 's a root in there we 'll have to go after . I 'm sorry , Mrs. Marsh , you 'll have to set yourself . . . " She smiled at him brilliantly , confidently , proudly . She opened her mouth wider . Ouida Marsh knew how to stand pain . A half-hour later he was finished . He shook his head at her admiringly . Not a sound had passed her lips . " It 's all in the mind , Dr. Sorenson . The mind controls the body . " She went home , she set her house in order and waited for Lucas . When he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the countryside . They had the evening to themselves , a long evening . She at quietly by while he studied , made him sandwiches after a while , insisted he drink warm milk , which he detested , and which he drank with a smile , to please her . They were marvellously close . The next day they were rich with themselves . Ouida laughed like a girl . Lucas ' eyes swam , adoring her . On the third evening she drew out a Ouija board . She bade him sit with her at the kitchen table . She drew the blinds . She lowered the lights . " Now we shall see , " she smiled , seating herself as at a feast . " Now we shall see what flows through you . " He looked away embarrassed . " Oh , no , Mother . . . not that stuff . . . please . . . " " Not stuff , darling . You do n't really mean that . I want you to try this . Try it with Mother . Just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything about it ! Boogies and spirits and  --  " " Do you remember fairies , darling ? Do you remember how when you were a little boy they used to talk to you ? " " Yes , " he said , flushing and ashamed . " Look at me , Lucas . And how you used to come to me and tell me about it ? And how Mother explained to you ? You were n't afraid of fairies , were you , Lucas ? " He sighed . " Well , they were n't fairies , Lucas . They were spirits . Good spirits . They do n't come to every little boy . Only a few , a very few , a chosen few . But you  --  they hover about you always , Lucas . I see them hovering about you now . " He looked about apprehensively . " You must n't he afraid , son . This is one of God 's greatest gifts to us . . . for the spirit of man is mighty , Lucas . The spirit of man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over are waiting , waiting about us , protecting us , waiting to tell us . . . She placed his hands on the planchette . She shut her eyes . Her face lifted in the gloom . He looked away from the bruise on her mouth . " Lightly , Lucas . . . lightly . . . lightly . The silence gathered about them and seemed to solidify . The darknesscontained movement . Fear prickled the back of his neck . He breathed faster . The planchette had moved. 60 " Ask it a question , Lucas . " Her whisper frightened him . " Ask .. . ask . . . ask to yourself . . . How soon will I be a doctor ? he thought . He made it a sentence and said it silently . Will Dad help me ? Must I run away ? The planchette moved under his fingers . He lifted his finger tips until they barely touched the wooden tripod and it drifted from beneath his hands . He followed it quickly . His mother 's eyes were shut . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it drifted on , moved waveringlyabout the board . His eyes widened and tears of fright flooded them . Over and over the board the planchette moved , now dashing to a letter , now halting , irresolute . Could one believe ? Could one really believe ? The darkness pressed closer . In the silence there was only the sound of the tripod , moving on felt , sibilant , small . . . . In the darkness Ouida spoke at last and her voice and her words caromed in the silence . " They 're all about us , " she said tiredly . She cleared her throat . " Do you believe , Lucas ? Do you believe , now ? " " Yes , Mother , " he whispered . He looked toward her with fear , trying to make out her face in the gloom . " Did they tell you what you wanted to know , dear ? " She took his hands . " I think so , " he said uncertainly . " They told me something too , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " she said , " No . . . we wo n't talk about it . . . " Lucas stirred . She rose . She turned on a light . " Well ! " she said smiling . She coughed . " That was fun , was n't it ! Was n't that wonderful , Lucas ? " " What did they tell you , Mother ? " he asked eagerly . Her mouth continued to smile but her eyes stopped smiling and becamedistant . " We wo n't discuss it , " she said brightly . She walked to him and kissed him . She hugged him to her . Her arms relaxed , stayed about him , began to rock him slightly . " You must never be frightened , Lucas . " " No , Mother . " His love for her hurt him , it was a mighty pain . " The love of God surrounds you . It surrounds you , always . Peace and eternal love . Open your heart , Lucas . There is a part of you that knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . The body does not matter , Lucas . This , and only this , matters . Within you is a world , the only real world , my son . The rest is only illusion . The shell . Man is a part of Almighty God . Man is God . Man is spirit . Man is soul . Man is mind . The rest is animal . " She rocked him slowly , gently , infinitely . " Within you is truth , you have all power , power to command , power to rule , power to see , and understand . . . within you , Lucas . . . within you . . . nothing else matters ... . They had never been so close. 61When Job returned Lucas awaited him guiltily , wanting him , heavy with disloyalty . Job was in excellent humor . His smile faded when he saw Ouida . " I want to say something , " he said . Lucas turned to disappear from the room . " No , son , you stay . I want you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did a terrible thing and I 'd give anything I 've got not to have done it . You can say what you like to me , I deserve it , and I 'd welcome it . I beg your pardon . I deeply beg your pardon . I apologize . " Lucas stared at the floor , not daring to look at either of them . " Well , it was a terrible thing , " Ouida said uncertainly . " It was a terrible thing and I 'd like to cut off my arm if it would do any good to undo it , and I apologize . " Job appeared deeply and sincerely moved . Ouida looked at him , amazed . " Well . . . " she began . She faltered . " Well . . . we all make mistakes . . . Job walked forward and took her humbly in his arms . " I missed you , " he said honestly . " You do n't know how I missed you . " Ouida thought desperately , wildly . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the beautiful , beautiful country  --  " " Why do n't you run down to the shop , son ! " Job called . " Your mother and I have something to talk about . " Lucas started to the door . " I 'll go right down , " he said eagerly . " See how everything 's going ! " Job called after him , grinning . He turned to Ouida . " What do you say , Ouida ? Shall we make up for lost time ? " " Please , Job . " She twisted away . " Everything 's been so nice  --  so calm  --  so peaceful  --  " " I came to you on my knees , " he said humbly . " Are n't we man and wife ? Do you despise me that much ? " " It is n't that , Job . I just do n't  --  I never  --  Let 's sit down shall we ? And you 'll tell me where you 've been and what you 've done , and I 'll tell you about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ? " " Ouida ! Please ! I 'm your husband ! I 've come back to you ! Is this howyou 're going to treat me ? I 'm a man  --  must I go outside my own home  --  " He put his arm around her waist . He drew her , unwilling , to thestairs . She bit her lip , she closed her eyes , he led her upstairs . Afterward he bathed and changed his clothes . He could do anything now . Nothing could stop him . He had won everywhere . It was impossible  --  everything was impossible  --  and he had done it . Lucas returned . There was dinner . The house was at peace again. 62C HAPTJNaR 7Now this was the home and the community , the cave and the tribe , these were the drives that forged the gambits of survival , the rules and the customs that controlled what was basic in living . And from these essentials and from this place , which was any place , Lucas Marsh had been dowered with reaction and living pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his vector embarked him toward his heritage . He was alone now , that which motivated him set him . apart . The pattern of those who begot him differenced him , made him more separate . His apartness , his loneliness , catalyzed his hunger . There was no doubt that Lucas was going to college . Job had set aside a fund for this , Lucas ' college fund . The harmony which marked his returnlasted barely two days . " He 'll come to , all right , " Job said confidently . " He 's never wavered an instant . I wish you 'd realize that , Job . He 's young . But part of him 's grown up . It 's beyond us . " " There 's no hurry . No hurry at all . You 'll see . " " I 'll see ! What do you ever know about him ! I was the way you are . I did n't want him to be a doctor either . But he 's set ! And if he wants it with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants . I know what 's best for him . " " How can you know what 's best for my boy ! " " Your boy ! " " Yes , my boy ! He 's mine , not yours ! I carried him under my heart  --  " " Look , Ouida ! Why do n't you just shut that big mouth of yours and mind your own goddamned business ! " " You 'll teach him ! He 'll grow up to be a degenerate like his father ! You miserable  --  " But Job was gone . " You 'll have to see your father , Lucas , " Ouida told him later . " I talked to him but it was no use . " " But I thought it was all settled . He 'll just get mad  --  " " He 's the one you 'll have to see . " " But  --  " " I 'm tired of fighting your battles for you . I 'm tired , tired , tired . Fight for yourself . . . . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucas told Professor Glenn , who taught him chemistry . Professor Glenn looked at him wearily over the chemistry counters littered with glassware . From out-of-doors the sound of classes dismissed for the day rioted faintly back to the deserted classroom . " There should n't be any difficulty , " the professor considered . " Your marks are high  --  " " I thought maybe you could tell me something I could say . " 63 " I think you 're setting up obstacles . If Medicine 's what you want to do , if you really think you 've made up your mind  --  " " Yes , sir , " said Lucas miserably . " Would you like me to speak to him on your behalf ? I do n't know your father but I 'd be glad to speak to him  --  " " No , no ! Oh , no ! Thanks , Mr. Glenn . " " Yes . . . Well .. . " I guess my fatal time has come , " Lucas said to Henry Moffatt , who fought him point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Henry thought in terms of decimal points of advantage , he thought coldly , school was grades , they were rivals but their distance from the remainder of the class placed them together in a perpetual guarded and armed truce . " I got to have a talk with him . " " Your grades are all right . What are you worried about ? " " It 's about being a doctor . " " Well , does n't he know ? Just tell him , that 's all . " " Sure . Just tell him . " " I 'd tell him . I 'd tell him , quick . " " Yes-s-s  --  sure , you 'd tell him . " " What 's the worst he can do ? Just tell me that . You tell him and what 's the worst he can do ? " " I do n't care what he can do  --  " " He can beat the tar out of you ! " " He 's never laid a hand on me . No , that 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that . . " Well then tell him . What are you bothering about ? " " He 's just so dead set . I 'd do anything to please him . But I do n't know how to want anything else . If I only knew I could  --  " " Gosh ! They must have got used to it by this time . Everybody knows you 're going to be a doctor ! What 's the matter ? " " They think I 'll change . I just ca n't make them see . They just do n't know . I hate it . I dread it . It 's gotten so I ca n't study or anything .. . Henry looked at him watchfully , alerted . " That 's a shame , . Luke , " he said , trying to hide his satisfaction . " That 's a plain shame . . . . As he had when he was a boy , Lucas waited outside Dr. Alexander 's office , sitting on his front porch . The doctor , emerging , looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something , " Lucas said to Dr. Alexander . The doctor shifted his bag to his other hand and waited . " I have to see my father about something . " Girl in trouble ? Gonorrhea ? wondered Dr. Alexander . He scanned Lucas closely . " I thought I 'd come by and maybe you 'd give me a little advice . Somethingyou could tell me , maybe . " " What 's the trouble , Lucas ? " " I want to be a doctor . " " Well ? " " I have to tell him so . " " But everybody knows you 're going to be a doctor ! " " Yes , sir . I thought there was something you could tell me I could tell him  --  " " Tell him what ? " " Explain to him  --  " " What is there to explain ? " " I have to kind of break it to him . " " Oh , Lucas ! He knows ! How could he help but know ? " " I guess he knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I feel will change . He 's sure of it . " " Maybe you will change , Lucas . Ever thought of that ? " " Yes , sir . I tried to imagine . There was n't any way I could imagine . " " Well . . . I 've got a few calls to make , Lucas . Talk it over with him . . . I 'm sure he 's reasonable . . . if you want I 'll drop by . " " Oh , no ! I 'll do it . " " I do n't know why you 're so apprehensive . He 's never seemed to me particularly violent . " " It is n't that , I just want a way to make him understand . I have to see him , I have to talk to him and I thought maybe there was something you could tell me  --  " " You 'll be a doctor , Lucas . Do n't worry about it . " " Not without his help . " " No . . . not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way through Medicine . " " You know that , do n't you ? " " I know . " " Not any more . " " Yes , sir . " " Go see him . Just talk to him reasonably , do n't antagonize him " Yes , sir . . . Doctor Alexander nodded and was gone . After that there was nobody else . The rest of the day he studied how to begin . He tried opening statements . He spoke them aloud , discarded them , selected new ones . There was a small sum of time remaining and the half-hours of this time alternatelyrushed panicky or dragged and would never end . His dread mounted . Desperately , desirously , he pondered escape . He would run away . Always , like a thing of granite was this , that he was of Medicine , that he must be a doctor . Around this granite his thoughts were mists and they eddied and swirled about this immovable fact , this stone , this upreared and unalterable and uncaring granite and in a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the interview . A moment later he was helpless with dread again . " He 's going to talk to you tonight , " Ouida warned Job . " I 'll take care of it , " Job said . " Do n't be a fool , now . He loves you  --  " " You just mind your business , Ouida . I 'll handle it . " Job pushed back his dinner plate . " Well  --  " he grinned  --  " got to take a drive tonight . Got to see Miller . What do you say , Luke ? Like to take a little ride with me ? " Lucas rushed to get his hat and coat . For a time they drove without speaking . " Country looks nice this time of year , do n't it ? " Job said after a while . " Oh , yes ! Yes , it does ! " " Wants a little more rain . " He clapped the boy on the knee . " What do you say , Luke ? Got something on your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to tell me about ? About college , maybe ? " " That 's it . I wanted to ask you  --  " " Well , you 're going to college . That 's all there is to that . Rest your mind easy . Your mother and I have made up our minds . You 're going to college . " " Yes , sir . That 's wonderful ! Thank you , Dad ! " " Never failed you yet , have I ? " " Oh , no ! No , never ! " " Do n't worry your mother , Luke . She 's fretting , she 's losing weight over you . Everything 's going to be all right . You just go ahead and study and enjoy yourself all you can while you 're young and let me do the wor-rying . " He clucked to the horse . " And when you 're through  --  when you 've had all the learning you want  --  why , there 'll be your place waiting for you . Right beside me . You and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " There was a little silence . " The point is , you 'll change , Lucas . You 'll look back on all this and laugh . You 've got to remember , Luke , I know what 's best for you . That 's all I 'm after . Not what I want . You 're like your mother in some ways . You do n't know the world . It is n't what you think at all . The way you are it 's all plans and dreams and ambitions . It 's different . It is n't that way by a damned sight . It 's what 's born in us and what we are . That 's what the world is . " " I know . I know what you mean . At least I try to know . But it 's just the way you say . Everybody is different , Dad . Not everybody 's in the harnessbusiness . " " I do n't care what business you go in , particularly , boy . 1 'd like to see you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to go into business . That 's the main business . That 's life . All the rest is hogwash . If you could corner the doctor business  --  but you see you ca n't do that . They trade in knowledge and what kind of business is it when there is n't enough knowledge to get the trade ? And keep it ? Sure you treat sick folk and maybe that makes you feel good . That 's kid stuff . Look at the farmer and look at the vet . The farmer needs the vet of course , one of his cows gets sick he calls the vet in a hurry . Pays him a good fee , too . But when66the farmer goes home he 's got thirty cows and when the vet goes home he has n't even got one cow , all he 's got is a little money for treating one of the thirty cows the farmer 's got . Do you see what I mean ? You be the farmer . Pay some other poor dog for his services . See @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing will ever change it . " " Yes , Father . " " You speak up . You speak right up and speak your mind . Do n't be afraid . " " I am afraid . " " What are you afraid of ? Me ? Why me ? " " I 'm afraid you 'll think I 'm stubborn . I do n't want you to get mad . " " I 'm not going to get mad . Not the slightest chance of it . That 's what we came out here for  --  to talk . " " You see  --  it 's hard for me to explain to you  --  " " Go right ahead , boy . " " I  --  I do n't know anything else except being a doctor . That 's all I 've ever thought of . I ca n't imagine how it would be not to feel that way . Just like I 'd say I am a boy  --  and ca n't understand being anything elseit'shard , it 's very hard to explain  --  " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Talk it out . " " Well , that 's about all , Dad . I do n't really want to go into the harness business . . . " There 's lots of businesses  --  " " I do n't want to go into any business . Even if I did want to  --  but I ca n't want to . I 've tried . I want you to believe that . There just is n't anything else . " " Well , you have n't got any great problem there . You can always make it a second ambition . Make all the money you can first . Then , someday when you 're rich and can afford to amuse yourself any way you 're a mind to , cut loose and take a vacation and study to be a doctor , if you want to . You can always do that . Meanwhile , let me be your guide , Luke . " " But you ca n't do that , Dad ! You ca n't put it off ! " " Then make it your hobby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it and make Medicine your hobby . Lots of people do that . Any number of successful men  --  " " Who ? " " Who ? I do n't know who ! They just do ! " " It 's different , Dad , with Medicine . You 've got to throw your whole life into it  --  you 've got to start and never stop  --  it 's your whole life  --  it 's  --  " " All right , Lucas , you 've talked long enough . I 've heard everything you had to say , you 've got it all off your chest , I 've tried to be patient , I 've tried to show you how things stand . It 's all right for a boy to dream , I can understand that . But you 're no boy any longer . You 're a young man . It 's high time you took stock of yourself and the world you 've been born into and put these silly schoolgirl schemes and dreams behind you . You 've had your fling and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was up at four o'clock every morning and I worked until I dropped and I was hungry and cold most of the time and ragged the rest . Now I 'll tell you this , Lucas . And it 's the last I 'll tell you . And I 've had my say . If you want to be a doctor you can be a doctor . I 'll not lift a finger to stop you. 67You go right ahead and be whatever you want . But do n't expect me to help you do something I know is dead wrong . For I wo n't do it . I wo n't have any part in it . I 've gone along , been reasonable . Waited for you to come to your senses . You talk like a child . Now do as you please . But do n't forget this . Tack it up in your memory and do n't forget it . I 'm not sending you to college and paying my good money so you can learn to make a living telling some rich bitch why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Therefore Lucas made his plans to run away . He did not plan with resentment or anger or indignation . He planned with fear . He was afraid that if he did not run away he would not become a doctor . He went to Dr. Alexander again . He asked for advice , where to go , what to do . He was humble , he was anxious , and he was inflexible . Dr. Alexander listened . When Lucas left he clapped on his hat and went to the harness shop . " I 'd like to have a talk with you and Mrs. Marsh , " he said shortly . " Absolutely . Nothing we ca n't straighten out , I guess . Wait a minuteand we 'll go see Mrs. Marsh . Or would this evening do just as well ? " " I 've got my calls . As you say , it wo n't take long . " Ouida opened the door . She stared from Job to the doctor . " What 's wrong ? What 's happened ? " " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor feels there 's something we ought to know . " He pushed past her into the house . " Is it Lucas ? " Her hand flew to her throat . " Is something the matter with him ? " Her voice had become husky . She coughed , swallowed hard . " Nothing has happened , Mrs. Marsh . " Dr. Alexander sat down . " We are three adults and between us we can see that nothing does . Lucas is about to run away . " " Now I think of it , it 's the best thing that could happen to him , " Job cried . " Make a man of him . " " But he 's never given any sign  --  I " Ouida protested . She cleared her throat impatiently . " He 's happy in his home  --  his school life  --  he 's a good boy  --  is he in trouble ? " " He wants to study Medicine , " said Dr. Alexander . " He wants to study Medicine ? " Ouida echoed . " He wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we do n't let him study Medicine he 's going to run away . " Ouida looked at the two men unbelievingly . " That 's right , " said Job angrily . " So the doctor has to take time off from his work and I have to take time off from my work  --  I ought to be in Meridian right this very minute  --  " " Yes , " said the doctor . " Well , there it is . Tell me , have you got anythingagainst Medicine ? " " You know how it is , Doc . A man wants his kid to have the best . I 've had to make my own way , I 've had to work hard all my life . And you and I know that Medicine is n't exactly , well  --  " " It 's not a field a man goes into to make his fortune . " " That 's what I say . That 's all I say . " " I 've known Lucas since he was a little boy . I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some men are born to be doctors . I should n't be at all surprised but Lucas is one of those men . " " But you 're not sure ! " " No , I 'm not sure . I 'm not really too sure of anything . But as sure as I can be of anything , I 'm sure Lucas was meant to be a doctor . " Ouida started to speak but was overwhelmed by a storm of coughing . They waited for her to subside . " I 'm not what you 'd call a hard man , Doctor . Mostly , I 've left the whole care of the boy to his mother . That 's right and proper . But this is a decision for men . It is n't a choice left up to children and women . You know what the world is . And I know what the world is . It is n't any dreamworld . I 'd like it so , well as the next . But it is n't . It 's what it is . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You 've got to have it . There 's only one way to get . it , you 've got to get it from the next fellow . There 's folks think that is n't a pretty picture . I do n't see anything wrong with it . And if I did , it would n't matter a damn . For that 's the way it is . Right or wrong , that 's the world we 're born into , whether we 're born with a hankering for this or that or God knows what . " " You mind your manners ! " Ouida cried . Job ignored her . " Now , do n't go getting mad if I tread close to the bone . " " You keep a civil tongue in your head , " said Ouida angrily . " This is between Doc and me . You just sit back and keep your mouth shut . Now then , Doc ! Can a man be a rich doctor ? " " There 's no reason why he should n't  --  " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never go out of this house ! " " I 'm going to answer what I think is in your mind . The highest ideal of a good doctor does n't includes riches . Many a doctor has invested the money he 's made through healing and become rich that way . In the purest sense of the word , if he 'd been devoting every instant to his patientshe would n't have had time for investments . And if someone had made the investments for him he should , ideally , have plowed the money back into his practice to provide better equipment and care for his patients . There are also men who fight to establish a practice in a fashionableneighborhood , in a rich neighborhood , and who become rich that way . That conflicts with the highest ideal of Medicine , for healing is for all , and one should not aim to heal only the rich . I 'm going to be entirely truthful with you ; in the finest possible sense of the word there is no such thing as a rich doctor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the reason why you do not want your son to study Medi-cine ? " " That 's it , Doc . I could hem and haw and say a lot more . But that 's it . " " And I 'm his mother ! And I say he has a right to follow what God has put in his heart . " " God put in my heart an almighty yen to be a circus rider once , " Job said with a grin . " I think Lucas will be a doctor , Mr. Marsh , " said Dr. Alexander . " I69think you 'd be wise to help him . I do n't think there 's anything else in life for him . " " Over my dead body . " " He ca n't do it alone . That 's what I must tell you . He knows that . " " I 'll tell you what . If he likes it bad enough he 'll work his way through . " " Not Medicine . " " He ca n't work his way through college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You mean to tell me nobody 's ever worked their way through medicalcollege ? " " A few . It 's been done . It used to be easier . But the more we discover , the more there is to study . Today the chances of a boy going through medical school without help are hopeless . There is n't time . He has eight hours of classroom work every day . He has to study at least five hours . He has to sleep seven hours . If he spends an hour a day to eat three meals and perform his natural functions , that leaves him three hours . " " That 's three hours , though , " Job said stubbornly . " When I was a boy  --  " " Those three hours are badly placed for a boy looking for work . They come after an ordinary man 's usual working hours . They offer part-time jobs , janitor work , dishwashing , maybe tutoring . And there 's hundreds competing in those three hours . " " There 's Sundays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sundays . And assuming he 's so very , very fortunate as to find work on Sunday , assuming he 's able to get ten hours work every Sunday , his total hours for a week add up to twenty-eight hours . If he 's most fortunate , he 'll get as high as thirty cents an hour . It is n't likely . But even then his weekly earnings will amount to eight dollars and forty cents a week . " " Look , Doc ! When I was Luke 's age I was on my own . If I 'd had eight whole dollars every week  --  " " Eight dollars a week is n't what it used to be , Mr. Marsh . The hame strap that used to cost me a dollar at your shop now costs me a dollar and sixty cents . But out of that eight dollars and forty cents a week , your son would have to clothe himself , feed himself , and provide a roof over his head . " " Make a man of him ! " " And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How much is that ? " " Roughly , around three hundred dollars a term . Say six hundred a year . And add to that about seventy-five dollars for his books , all secondhand , his laboratory fees and supplies . The lowest you can possibly estimate  --  andI tell you frankly it can not be done on that  --  is that the boy has to earn seventy dollars a month . And in the summer , completely untrained , he will somehow have to earn the unheard-of sum of a hundred and twenty-five dollars a month , living at home , of course , and with no expenses . Can you think of some way he can earn in Milletta as much as a bank cashier ? " 70 " It ca n't be done , " said Job . " I say nothing of what it would do to his health . " " And how do you expect a boy to study with all that ? What does Lucas know about working ? " Ouida demanded indignantly . " That 's what it means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That 's right . " " And when he 's all through , when he 's graduated  --  " " Then a year as intern at some hospital  --  the best one he can get into . And the best hospitals take the brightest boys  --  those who 've had most time to study . " " What does he get then ? " " He gets his meals , his uniforms , his laundry , and from ten to fifteen dollars a month . " Job 's face darkened . " That 's what it is to be a doctor ! That 's the big reward , is it ? " " I 'm not going to hold anything back . I 'm going to give you the whole picture . When he 's through with his internship he has to set up in practice . It 's going to cost him at least three thousand dollars for his instruments , his office , his equipment . And when he 's done all that , probablygone into debt for it , like most of us , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be five years , all of five years , before he even begins to get out of the red . That 's what it is . That 's the whole picture . I have n't tried to give you the bright side . " He finished speaking and there was silence . " Can you imagine yourself a doctor ? " " No offense  --  I frankly ca n't ! " " Well , Lucas ca n't any more imagine himself being a businessman . He just ca n't imagine it . I do n't know you folks very well . I 'm thinking of the little fellow who used to haunt my doorstep . He knows you know what 's best for him . He knows you love him and you 're wiser than he is . He would give anything to be what you want him to be . He does n't know how . He 's what he is . Nothing can change him . It does n't happen often . It happens once in ten million . He 's born to it . Rich or poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor . The rest is up to you . I ca n't say more . " " He 'll be a doctor , " Ouida said quietly . " I only want to do what 's right for the boy , " Job said stubbornly . " I still say  --  " Job wavered . He was confused . He was alone . It was as if he were losingthe boy , as if Lucas were vanishing into another world . There was nothing to share with him . He was on his alien way . He was adrift in a world where he would invent phrases to cover his bare bones and maxims to fill his belly , adrift like millions around him , milling like cattle around the planet , lost and lost and lost and all the while with a father who knew the way , who could help him , who could share the truth with him , open his eyes to it , set him securely on the only way . " Mr. Marsh and I want only what 's best for the boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to us . None of us knew how deep it was with Lucas , it could have been only a child 's fancy . . . 71 " I 've got to be on my calls , " the doctor said . He looked at his watch . " I 'm late . " " Want to thank you . " Job rose numbly . " Glad to pay you for your time  --  " " No need for that ! I should have come sooner . " " Man 's time is worth something  --  " " You give that boy his chance and I 'll be more than paid . " " I want to thank you , Doctor  --  " Ouida came toward him . " I want you to know  --  " A cough interrupted her . " I want  --  " The cough overwhelmedher , she was racked by a spasm , she groped back to her chair and bent over it , helpless . " That 's a bad cough you 've got there . " Dr. Alexander walked to her side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heard over the noise of Ouida 's coughing . " She 's been losing weight , too . " He was glad of the diversion . " Better look her over , Doc . " The doctor pressed Ouida into the chair . He tilted her head back . A little blood showed at the corners of her mouth . She bent her head , swallowed , mastered the coughing , drew a deep breath . " It 's nothing . I 'm quite all right . Really . " Doctor Alexander stooped , opened his bag , drew out a wooden depressorand a reflector . " All right , now ? " Ouida nodded . He opened her mouth . He peered at her throat . He looked a long time . He let her close her mouth . He drew back and waited . Then he opened her mouth again , bent over her and peered again . He straightened . He removed the reflector from his forehead and put it back in the bag . " Bad one , ai n't it , Doc ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told her get it looked at  --  " " Smoke  --  " Ouida swallowed . " Smoke got in my lungs . Burned a bread pudding . Whole kitchen full of smoke  --  " She waved her hand . " I think you 'd better come to the office , " the doctor said . He smiled . " I rarely go to doctors . I 'll come in sometime if it is n't better . " " Yes . No hurry . Still  --  would n't do any harm to come on back with me  --  get it over  --  " " Go on , Ouida ! Place sounds like a dog pound ! " " It really is n't necessary  --  " Ouida searched the doctor 's face . " Might as well catch it , " the doctor said indifferently and firmly . " Wo n't take a minute . . . Job drove them to the doctor 's office and returned soberly to the shop . In the shop he stood sadly . The boy was not lost yet . He held to that thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could happenin those two years . In those two years lay the whole answer . If he could n't make the boy see reason in two years it would be his own fault . The truth was there , plain and easy . The boy would see it . The scales would drop from his eyes . He 'd look up one day , he 'd laugh at himself . And he and the boy would be together . Forever . The whole world their oyster . The world waiting for them . It was a lonely world . There wasn't72any doubt of that , the world was damned lonely . Ouida was all right but she had a world of her own , she lived in another world . Nobody lived in the right world . Only himself . It was lonely , all right . Sometimes it was damned lonely . Now there 'd be the boy . He and the boy . And the boy 'd have something to come to , by God ! He remembered Meridian suddenly . He reckoned his small empire of eight stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting still too long . Time was wasting . He had the store in Meridian now . And who 'd ever have believed that ? It was easy . The world was easy . The world was made up of fools who played games and mouthed pious noises at each other as they gulped at each other 's guts . Little nibbling gulps . Polite gulps . With their little fingers held out , just so . As if they were n't feeding on each other at all , oh no , they were n't doingwhat they seemed to be doing at all . They were n't even seeming to be doing . Job grinned . The boy and he would have many a chuckle over it . He got together his papers and headed for Meridian. - Cl- AP ER 8In the doctor 's office Ouida sat down gingerly in the examining chair and held her mouth open . " I 'm not going to look right now , Mrs. Marsh . I want to ask you some questions . " " I 've had quinsy a long time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so badly last winter I 've never been able to shake it off . " " Made you lose weight , too ? Dropped quite a bit ? " " Yes . I always stay the same . But lately  --  " She gathered a loose fold of her dress . " What have you been doing for this quinsy. ? " " I want you to know something , Doctor . I 'm here because I 'm grateful to you . I do n't want to hurt your feelings . That 's why I came . I believe in mind over matter . I control my own body . Completely and absolutely . I 've never been ill a moment in my life . My body does n't control me . When I let this quinsy take over I am being punished for my own weakness . " " If everyone was like you where would my practice be ? " " You may laugh at me if you wish  --  " " Not at all ! Not at all , Mrs. Marsh  --  " " I do not permit illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And you used  --  ? " " I do not expect you to believe this , Doctor , but there are forces , forces not of this earth , divine forces . I summon them . They cure me . " " Those  --  ah  --  forces , they are all you have employed ? " She bent her head slightly . " Once or twice , when the pain was particularly strong  --  when I was particularly weak , rather  --  I used a strong salt gargle . They rebuked me . " He looked at her seriously , his eyebrows lifted inquiringly . " My forces . They instructed me . They took away my salt water . They told me to use witch hazel . " " You gargled with witch hazel ? " " With the pure infusion of the trees as God made them . " " And did this give you relief ? " " I have been remiss . If I had continued I should be cured . " " You used nothing else ? " " Nothing . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None . I did as I was told . They have never failed me . " " Yes . Now , if you will open your mouth again He searched her throat closely . " I am going to do something that may cause you discomfort . " She smiled contemptuously . She opened her mouth to him . He bent closer . In a little while she gagged , he continued nevertheless a moment longer . He straightened at last , looked at her . She looked back at him se- renely , questioningly . He sat down at his desk and began to write . " I wo n't need any medicine , Doctor , " she said firmly . " No , I know . This is just something to ease that cough a little  --  " " Is it witch hazel ? " she demanded . " Sort of witch hazel , something we made from witch hazel  --  " " Well  --  " she said doubtfully . " You could call it witch hazel , all right . " " I 'm not supposed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essence of witch hazel , you might say , purified witch hazel  --  " " You may think me odd , Doctor , but I assure you there are things not found in books  --  " " I encounter those things every day , " he said gravely . " You have a perfect right to whatever is  --  revealed to you . " " Do you think Lucas really would have run away ? " " He would have hated to , but he honestly saw no other course . " " But I 'm his mother ! Why did n't he come to me ! I ca n't imagine Lucas  --  " " Would you have advised him to run away ? " " We could have talked it over . There would have been a way  --  " " Tell me , Mrs. Marsh , what did your mother die of ? " " She had heart failure , poor soul . My father too . " " Yes . . . Any throat weakness ? " " Not that I know of . Oh , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  ? " " I 've always seemed to have a weakness here . " She put her hand to her throat . " Nothing to bother me , much . But when I caught colds they always seemed to lodge just here . They were the worst of the colds . Not that I 've had many , " she said hastily . " And lately I 've had lumps  --  these lumps on my shoulder . " She pulled her dress to show him . He fingered the lumps expressionlessly . " And this particular sore throat  --  " 74 " I 've had it ever since I burned the pudding , the whole kitchen was full of smoke and  --  " " But not before ? " " Not that I know of . Oh , it was sore from time to time , little sorenesses , they passed , everything passes , you know , Doctor . . . " " I admire your courage , Mrs. Marsh . " " Thank you . " She flushed . " I wish more of my patients were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She smiled . He hesitated . He looked over his notes again swiftly . " Yes . Have this filled . " " Is it a gargle ? " " No , these are pills . You may gargle if you like . Take these pills . When your throat is sore , when you feel you should take them . That will be your best guide . " Lucas , who had been home , then to the harness shop , was waiting for her when she returned home . " Where have you been ? " he asked anxiously . " What have you been up to ? What 's this I hear  --  from strangers  --  that you 're going to run away ? " " There 's nothing else for me to do , " he said in a low voice . " There 's always something else for you to do . You could always come to the mother who loves you . " " You do n't know , Mother . I had a talk with Father . " " Tell me what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's no use . " " Tell me , Lucas . " " You 'd only get mad at him and then there 'd be fighting , and I 'd be the cause of it . He 'll never understand . Never ... " " I do n't want to ever hear again as long as I live that you 're running away . Do you hear me , Lucas ? If you feel you must run away you must come to me and tell me . Now listen ! Now you are going to feel foolish . " She waited . He said nothing , his head down . " Did you think Dr. Alexanderwas going to help you ? He came straight to us ! Why do you do such things , Lucas ? Why do you torment me ? Going to strangers ! Confidingin a stranger and not your own mother ! What have I done to deserve such a thing from you ! I know I must deserve it . But what have I done ! Only tell me ! " He gaped at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean Dad said I could ? " " Now , Lucas ! Do n't get excited ! He has n't said so ! " " But there 's a chance ? A chance ? " " Lucas ! Now stop it ! " He groped toward her . She gathered him in hungrily . " My own boy . . . " She rocked him in her arms . " My darling , my darling . . . " She coughed , held him closer , held back the cough swellingin her by sheer will . She did not understand why Lucas was so moved , the violence of it was beyond her understanding , but he was in her arms and he clung to her. 75Dr . Alexander stopped at the harness shop next day . " I 'd like to speak to you for a moment . " " Come in , Doc . Sit down . What 's on your mind ? " " I want you to prepare yourself . I have something to tell you , some- thing you must face . " " Ouida ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . " Oh , now , her tongue gets a little loose now and then . I do n't know what she 's said , Doc , but you must n't mind it . Why , Lord , she says things to me that  --  " The doctor looked at him compassionately . " It 's cancer , Mr. Marsh . Cancer of the throat . " Job sat down . He swallowed . He stared at the doctor . " Cancer of the throat ? " " There 's no possible doubt . I wish there were . I 'm afraid it 's in the last stages . " " You 're joking ! " " Would you like to take her to another doctor ? I can understand . I wish there were room for doubt . By all means have someone else  --  " " Ouida ? You talking about Ouida ? " The doctor nodded sadly . " But she 's still walking around  --  healthy  --  same as ever  --  " " I know . It 's horrible . . . . She 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Job cried wildly . " At the outside . Perhaps in two . It 's going very fast . It 's out of control now . I 'm going to say something to you , Mr. Marsh : it would be the blessing if she died tonight ! " Job licked his lips . " Have n't you ever noticed she had trouble swallowing ? " " Never  --  no , by God , never ! Wait ! Last Christmas a piece of plum cake seemed to choke her . She 's been tetchy for soft foods ever since . That 's right ! Trouble swallowing ! Hell , she 's always had trouble with her throat , more or less , colds seemed to take her there , quinsy sort of , never gave it a thought , never babied herself any , so naturally I never thought  --  you can operate , ca n't you ? There 's bound to be some chance  --  1 " " There is n't a chance , Mr. Marsh . I can operate . But I know before I start  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll want you to operate  --  " " I do n't think she will . You know Mrs. Marsh . She might . I 'll do whatever you say . You 're going to have to face it . She 's going to have a bad time . And you 're going to have to watch it . At first I can give her pills . I gave her some today . I had to tell her they were witch hazel . She 's in considerable pain . She 's not the type that lets on . They were n't witch hazel , of course . They were morphine . She 'll need more and more . In a little while morphine wo n't help her . " " There must be something  --  " " There is . There 's one thing . Death . " Toward the end , Ouida Marsh seemed to become younger , young as a young girl . Her body withered rapidly as the doctor had predicted , she 76 complained of quinsy and when her remedies did not help her she turned apathetically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to guess what agonies she bore , for she bore them silently , but they must have been very great and , for a lesser person , unendurable . Once , Lucas came home early from school to hear the low noise of her hoarse cries , but she heard the door open and close and an instant after he enteredshe was silent . She wrote long letters to Lucas and to Job , and towardthe end it was evident from these letters that she must have had an inkling of her waiting death . Her throat closed rapidly , then sloughed open , then closed again ; her sounds were thick and burbled and unintelligible . For a time she was lonely and frightened . However close Lucas pressed himself to her , however long into the night Job sat beside her watching , holding her hand , they did not seem able to reach her , to be with her , to be in place of the loneliness and the fear . Then the blessing of the morphine took her mind and greater and greater doses pushed back everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agony too deep to be reached . Toward the end they prayed for her to go . They loved her , a part of Lucas died with her , but it was too much . Too much , too much , greater than all of them , too much to bear , poor soul let her go , let her die , let it end . . . . The doctor stayed with her very late one night . Next morning she was dead . She lay as a young girl might lie , curled , very small , cold , motionless , her haggard mouth a little open , her eyes closed . Where her body had rested the sheet was a little stained . " No ! " screamed Lucas , " you will not bury her ! Never ! Never ! Never ! " " Son , son , " snuffled Job . " It 's all right , boy , they 've got to do it . . . " " Never ! Please , please , never . . . " Ouida Marsh was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . The earth was smoothed . The day ended . The sun rose . The day ended . Day , day day , and then no more days . Now the weeks came , now a month . Time was a shattered window into the void . And into the void his tears fell . Into the blackness , the mouthing blackness , the tears fell , never stop , I swear it , never , never , never . And the tears stopped , slowly . They were a trickle . And then they stopped . And one day of one week of one month after the breast had healed , after the jags were lonely palisadespeering the unknown , one day the glass was whole again . And time was a window . And beyond the window was Ouida , dead . Beyond the window . Not gone . But gone , all the same . Lucas sat by the grave long , still hours . He sat by the grave and77looked into time and shivered and saw nothing . He sat and brooded and now and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far beneath , patted as if he patted Ouida herself , ran his fingers through the grasses . He brooded nothingness . He had no thoughts . Once he stepped upon a corner of the grave and shrank , cringing , and moaned . Over and over he patted her where he had stepped , where it had hurt . After a while he returned to school . When the day 's study was over he went to the cemetery . He brought his books and there he studied , and sometimes he talked about his problems and sometimes he read aloud . You could not see his lips move . A few feet away and you could not even hear him . Her feet could not hear him . Only her head . In the evening he would rise , he would walk reluctantly away from her , he would leave this other home , he would sigh and walk to the house , he would let himself in . They had a servant , now , they had hired a girl who kept the house and looked after them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she slept there , in an unused room . And Job would enter , after a while , and put on a sober , unsmiling , grave face and when the evening meal had ended he would rise and leave the house and go silently back to the shop . And Lucas would study dully , and the time coming , rise and go to bed . Job entered the house reluctantly and left it with relief . For in the house and with Lucas the funeral had never ended . And for Job the funeral had ended on the day the first clod fell hollowly on Ouida 's coffin , within five minutes the grave was filled , the earth was flat except for the telltale mound , and with it , turning away , there was no help for it , Ouida was gone . There fell to his lot now a time for sober face , for small speech , for gravity , for decorous acceptance of the tribal noises of sympathy . Work was the same , the demands of the day were the same , everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing had happened to these things , there was no death here , no caring . But one did what was to be done un- smilingly , putting the smile away , decorous for the season of such things , sad for the time of sadness . " I guess you 're going to college this fall , ai n't you ? " he asked one night . " Am I ? " Lucas asked dully . " That 's what your mother wanted , " Job said quietly . " You 'll go this fall . " His heart warmed . " Got the money all laid aside . Been saving it a long while . I 'm always looking out for you , Lucas . Do n't forget that . " " I know , Dad . " " Sometimes it may seem as if I 'm not . But I always am . Do n't forget that . " Inwardly he groped for a new relationship . " You all right ? " he asked delicately . " I 'm fine , " Lucas said , faintly embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm lonesome , " said Lucas simply . " Same here , " said Job . He warmed at the confidence . There was , of course , nothing else to say . 78 Lucas , he confessed to himself next day , he did not understand . All other people were easy . He could almost always foretell unerringly what they would do ; within a few moments of meeting them he sensed their limits , their weaknesses , their vulnerabilities . But Lucas  --  He sighed . " I tell you , Charley , if I had n't married Mrs. Marsh I could have been one of the Morgans . " " Do n't doubt it . " " I 'll bet I could . " " I 'll say this for you , Job Marsh , there ai n't anybody in the world , and I worked in plenty of harness shops , there ai n't ever anybody knows harness like you do . " " I 'm glad I married her , you understand  --  " " Naturally . " " I 'm only saying  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finer woman never drew breath  --  " " Pretty  --  smart  --  " " You know something , Charley ? I 'll tell you something . She was her own worst enemy . " " I did n't know her good  --  " " Her own worst enemy . " If I was a young fellow , Job thought with alarm , I 'd be off in the cities right now . New York . I 'd be in New York , nothing could stop me , look at me here ! And do you know where I 'd be ? I missed a boat ! That 's what I did ! And never knew it ! I 've got to get going ! While there 's still time ! " Hang on , Charley , " he said jubilantly , free . And he departed for Meridian . " What do you do all day ? " he asked Lucas next morning . " Nothing , " Lucas said defensively , " I take walks , I read  --  " " Do n't want you hanging around the house  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to come down to the shop , help out a while , take your mind off things . " " Yes , sir . " " Instead of frowsting around . " Lucas looked down at his plate . " Might as well come down this morning . " " Now ? " " If you 're through eating . That 's where I 'm going . " Thereafter for a week Lucas went to the harness shop with his father every morning . For a time Job and Charley set him to sorting harness , hoping to infect him with interest by the contagion of leather , and if he had shown any interest or even capacity they were leagued to put him to small repairs . But Lucas had no interest in harness , neither in the shape of leather nor in its odor , its repair or its purposes . He sorted badly . " You blind or something ? " Job asked incredulously . Charlie turned away , embarrassed . " I 'm sorry , " said Lucas. 79 " Do n't even know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straps and things that do n't even look like each other . " " I 'm sorry . I can see it , now  --  " " You 're a smart boy , Lucas . You 're not that dumb ! " " I 'm not doing it deliberately  --  " " He do n't do nothing else all day , Mr. Marsh . I 'll say that for him , " Charley seconded . " I do n't know what I 've done to you that you should do me that way , " Job said remindingly . " I 'll try  --  I ' 11 do better , " Lucas promised anxiously . " You better just wait on trade , " Job said . " Let him wait on the trade , Charley . The prices are marked on everything . " " I 'm sorry  --  I 'm really sorry . " Job nodded . He walked out of the shop . In the next two weeks he was seldom at the shop . The store in Meridianclaimed him . Usually he did not come home until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Dr. Alexander 's house in the eveningsafter dinner , content to sit on the porch and read his anatomy book as long as there was daylight if the doctor was out , and sometimes he arrived on time to go out on late calls with him . In the beginning he sat silent . " I want to tell you something , " Dr. Alexander said finally . " I know you 're grieving for your ma . And this is what I want to tell you . Save your pity for the living . The dead ca n't use it . And it wo n't save the dying . You 're wasting your time . Pity 's valuable . Do n't waste it . " After that it was easier . Somehow the grave was dug deeper . Somehow Ouida no longer lay just below the raw mound . But she returned to the house one night . She returned abruptly . It was on one of the nights Job returned from Meridian very late . This night Lucas heard him enter . He got out of bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercept Job and suggest a midnight raid on the icebox . His smile faded . Job was tiptoeing into the servant girl 's room . He watched , dumfounded , as the door closed . In another moment he heard his father 's voice , the servant 's giggle , a bed creaking . He returned to his room , leaving his door open . He sat on the edge of his bed . He tried to think but he could not . He felt Ouida present in the house , very strongly present , invincibly present . He choked with a distaste and shame . And then anger , and he sat on , rigidly , coldly committed , waiting , and when he heard the door open down the hall he rushed out to the landing . Job was leaving the servant 's room . He was barefoot . He had on only his trousers . He carried the rest of his clothing in his hand . He looked up , startled and then sheepish at the sight of Lucas . Lucas turned immediately and went back to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . For a long time he tried to sleep . At last he rose with deliberation , turned on his light , picked up his anatomy book , and began to read . Daylight came . He blinked , stretched , regarded the light with satisfaction , read on , heard the house stir , opened his door a few inches so that it could be seen that his light was on . When he had heard the servant and Job go downstairs he dressed leisurely . He sat oppositehis father during breakfast . He said nothing . Job read the paper. 80Into the shop that afternoon came Dr. Alexander . Job hastened forward . Dr. Alexander shook his head . " I see you 've already got a job , " he said to Lucas . " Not really , " Lucas said eagerly . " I 'm just in the way here  --  " " Thought I 'd break him in , " said Job . " Got him selling . Had a little trouble at first but now he 's doing all right . " " Glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well  --  I guess I 'll have to look for somebody else . " " Sorry , " said Job . " Wait ! " said Lucas . They looked at him . " You do n't really need me , Dad . " He looked at Job meaningly . " That so ? " said Job , challenged . " No , " said Lucas . " This is work our servant girl could do . " He looked steadily at his father . Job looked away : " I 'll be right with you , " Lucas cried to Dr. Alexander . He scrambled into his coat . " If you 're sure it 's all right , " said Dr. Alexander . " Guess he knows what he 's doing , " said Job . There was a faint smile on his reluctant lips . The shop door shut behind them . They got into the carriage . " You might as well start today , " said Dr. Alexander . " This is the sort of job that happens once in a lifetime to a fellow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man by the name of Fellowes . Have you ever heard of the Reverend Fellowes ? " The carriage jogged on . Dr. Alexander talked steadily . The Reverend Stephen Fellowes was a retired minister . He lived on the outskirts of the town he had once served and he had a small income which kept a housekeeperfor him . Lucas ' job was a simple one . He was to be the old man 's companion for the next two months , he was to sit with him , to read to him when he desired to be read to , and to be sure that he was served with a urinal every three hours . " I do n't say you 'll get rich from the wages , " Dr. Alexander admitted . " But you 'll have a patient . In a sense this man will be your first patient , there 's that element . And being exposed to a man like that for two months is better than a year of college . You 'll get five dollars a week and your lunches . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely different from Milletta . The Reverend Fellowes was a thin old man , given to long silences , to books , and to brooding . The first embarrassment of serving so remote a man with a urinal soon passed , Lucas learned to read aloud , and although much of what he read was incomprehensible to him , the Reverend Fellowes having a taste for religious quibbles of the eighteenth century , he read the whole of Homer that summer and a great deal of Virgil and Horace and Ovid and Suetonius and a history of the Greeks . At such times , and in such literary company , the thin old man 's parchment-like skin would acquire a faint rose hue , his eyes would become hard and bright , and the lines of his mouth would play with the letters of indomitable , he would be immortal in another century , he would be a dweller in another land , before another God , in a body that was flesh without mortality . And some of this beauty was transmitted to Lucas also . Long before81 the two months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionately and look at the world they lived in with a superior amuse ment from behind eyes that had travelled in many pages and in many worlds , and though it bred no hunger in him it bred respect , as a runner watching a weight thrower , or a king watching a president . And this re spect became stronger on those nights when Job was home for dinner , although he did not respect Job 's accomplishments less for the contrast between the two adults . But the day that was to remain longest in Lucas ' memory of that curi- ous summer , and the image that would all his life be sharpest remember- ing the Reverend Fellowes and his own youth and his young manhood and the essence of mankind in whom he had recognized himself as a part , came two weeks before the summer ended , as they were reading Xeno phon , as the Greeks were coming in sight of the sea . " Can you see it , Lucas ? Do you see those weary heroes , a single hero for all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all that Greece stood for , born and bred beside the sea 's white spume , cradled to its booming roar , the blood of the gods sluicing it wine-dark for the dreaming gaze of young men avid on the cliffs , gone to a far country , fighting among strange rocks , spent on alien sands , through forests and mountains and plains , the months passing , the years , and now come at last , come one day , come one opening of the eyelids of the gods , dumb- struck , disembodied , become eyes and soul , seeing it , seeing it  --  " ' Thalassa ! ' they cried . Their mouths opened . Their souls shouted . Thalassa ! The sea ! The sea ! ' " His face was transfigured . He was all that God could make of this man here in this time , in this place , his soul was clean , his mind was risen . " Thalassa , " he whispered . And then his face altered . The lines flowed slowly back to plastic , parchment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long , " he said apologetically . Lucas , still dazed , smiled at him , uncomprehending . " I 'm sorry , " the old man said . And suddenly Lucas noticed the wet stain on his trousers . He jumped to his feet guiltily . " The flesh , " the old man murmured as Lucas changed him . " Always the flesh , the flesh . Do you see how we are tied ? " he asked , suddenly peev ish . " Do n't forget that , young man . Do n't ever forget it . You 'll never be free till you 're dead . " " Will there be a Xenophon where we 're going ? " Lucas asked shyly . " I do n't know , " said the old minister . " If it were n't so I would be afraid to die . " The summer ended . Lucas spent the last days in the small hills about Milletta , avoiding the house , avoiding Job , avoiding the servant , avoiding even Dr. Alex- ander , content to be unseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen and lived , to watch the shimmering railroad tracks , to disappear with them , into the distance . The day came and he said farewell to the house , he went to the sta- 82 tion , he got into the train like a sleepwalker , while they were still seeking a seat the train moved on , it was over , he was on his way . In the seat beside him , Job studied a newspaper picture of an automobile . The caption said America was on its way to seventeen million autos . Job grinned . There were more farms than there had ever been , as long as there were farms there would be horses , as long as there were horses there had to be harness . He remembered , abruptly , gossip about a harness shop in Lankasville , a shop in trouble , a shop run down . He looked at his watch . Lankasvillewas larger than Meridian . He patted Lucas ' knee . " Guess we 're almost there , " he said . Lucas looked at him warily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind that friendliness was content . " You be a good boy , Lucas . " " I will , Father . " " If you want anything , you just write me . " " I do n't think I 'll need anything . I mean  --  I 've got everything  --  " " Do n't worry about anything . " " I wo n't . " " That 's the main thing . " " Yes , Father . " " You 'll be thrown in with a lot of strange people . Well , you were when you were born . Remember that . Every place you go in this world you 'll be thrown in with a lot of strange people . So do n't think anything of it . " " No , sir . " " Yes . . . Well ! . . . Now about women . " " You do n't have to  --  I mean  --  " " Do n't go getting any nice girl in trouble . That 's all you 've got to worry about . Just do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Father . But you do n't have to  --  " " A man 's got to have a woman . And I 'm not going to be goddamned fool enough to tell you otherwise . You 're going to have to have a woman and you 're going out looking for one . Just do n't go getting any nice girl in trouble . It costs money and trouble . Go get a chippie . Then you 'll be safe . Watch yourself . Pick a clean one . Because if you do n't you 'll find yourself wearing your whatsis in a Bull Durham sack . Clap . Disease . Hurts like hell . Now that 's all . I 've said my say . " He looked at Lucas and his features relaxed . " When you 're in trouble , come to me . I 'm your dad . " The train began to slow . Lucas rose . He reached for his bags in the rack overhead . " Think you can find it , all right ? " Job asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you coming with me ? " " Want me to ? Sure ! I 'll be glad to ! " " I thought  --  " " I 'll tell you what , Luke , if you can find it yourself it 'd be a help . Fact is , I have to get to Lankasville. " 83 " Oh . . . I did n't know . . . Why , sure , Father ! Sure I can find it ! Do n't you worry for a minute ! Everything 's swell ! " " Because if it is n't  --  if you want me  --  " " No , sir ! Absolutely not ! I 'm glad  --  I mean  --  " " Now you just tell me , Luke ! It wo n't take a minute ! It 's just that I 've just got time to make connections to Lankasville and if I go withyou  --  " " It 's silly , Father . There 's no need  --  " " I guess you can find it , all right  --  " " Of course I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! " Job 's hand dove into his pocket and emerged with a bill . He pressed it into Lucas ' hand . " I do n't need it , Father ! I 've got plenty  --  " " You just take that and pay the man out of it and he 'll set you right down at the door . There 's ten dollars . " " But it 's too much ! Honest , Father  --  " " Keep it ! There 's a little extra for you . " The train was stopping . They made their way down the aisle . Theystood on the platform . " Well , Luke  --  " ' They looked at each other uncertainly . They embraced awkwardly , quickly . Well , boyLucas got down from the train quickly . " Goodbye , Father . . . " Take care , now ! " " I will , Father ... " " Be a good boy . . . " Do n't worry  --  " " If you need anything  --  " The train began to move . " Goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Write me  --  " Job waved . The car passed . Another car succeeded it . Lucas stoodalone on the platform . A cab driver picked up his bags . " Take you there and set you down for a dollar'n a quarter . " Lucas nodded . The man turned and slouched toward his cab . Lucas followed him . His home was behind him and he was on his way to school and life had evolved to this , this day , and this beginning . And he rememberedwhere he was and walked more quickly. -* CHAPTER 10The enrollment he had so long desired and of which he had dreamed with such excitement and longing passed in a succession of clerical pro- gressions through which he moved prosaically and at the end of which84he found himself adrift again , trudging toward Saylor Hall and the roommate to whom he had been assigned . As he walked , one of hundreds of young men swarming erratically over the lawns and gravelled walks of the campus , the severity and ominousexactness of the college buildings penetrated his loneliness . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green acres , the river beyond , and behind the campus buildings , the fields and the woods which bordered them . He was jostled many times by the excited youth about hint and each time shyness suffocated him and he felt more alien . He came to Saylor Hall , he mounted the stone steps , he passed inside , he climbed again , he walked down a corridor , scanning doors , he retracedhis steps , he read the names on the door cards more carefully , he stiffened suddenly , his own name startled him and beneath his name Alfred Boone , his roommate , a stranger . He looked at the door uncertainly . He read the names again . Finally he opened the door of his home . There were three persons in the small room . Two of them , adults , a man and a woman , sat on one of the narrow beds . The third , a young man his own age , looked at him from before one of two bureaus . " I 'm Alfred Boone , " the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand outstretched . Lucas put down his suitcases uncertainly . They shook hands . " This is my mother and father . " He gestured to the bed . " He 's hogged the best bureau , he 's got the best bed , and if 1 were you I 'd make him start all over again , " Mr. Boone said calmly . " How do you do , " Lucas said , confused . " Do n't hit him too hard , " said Mrs. Boone , " just hit him once and get it over and we 'll all go out to supper together . " The young man bent his head toward them briefly . " Jokers ! " he explained . " You can have any bed you want . Any bureau appeals to you . We sat here for a while waiting and then  --  " " It 's all right , " Lucas muttered in an agony of shyness . " I do n't care  --  " " That 's no way to begin with him , " warned Mr. Boone. " lf I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie left . And take this bed , the one we 're sitting on  --  it 's the softest . " " Did you come alone ? " Mrs. Boone asked . " Yes , ma'am , " Lucas said . " I 'll tell you what you do , why do n't you just drop everything and let 's go out and eat ? " Mr. Boone said quickly . " Unpack ! " cried Mrs. Boone . " Hurry up and unpack ! Get it over ! " Flurried , Lucas hastened to open his suitcases , the room was quickly divided , the belongings of both young men were as quickly put away . Lucas covertly examined these strangers . They were complete strangers . The mother and father did not behave as parents ; their behavior was outside his experience . Their good humor and their joking were reminiscent of Job , but Ouida regarded levity suspiciously and rebuked it often . Here there was disconcerting poise and easiness . And these people liked each other . This was evidently long habit and85 Iiito them an unremarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred Boone he could not classify at all . As they ate together in the small university town Lucas ' confusion grew . They talked without preamble of anything , he could not anticipatetheir next thought . They included him in their intimacy and this equality and regard drew him mightily and at the same time surprised him and made him anxious . He responded timidly . He did his best tojoin them and to respond as they responded , but he did not know how . They were very happy together . There was finally no doubt of that . And as it became evident that this was their normal condition he forgot his apprehensions . He saddened ; he pitied them , he grew warmly fond of them and he wanted to protect them from the unsmiling world he knew lay about them , the harshness they ignored and the cruelties and the disappointments of which they seemed serenely unaware . Life had taught Lucas that laughter was a brief joy , unexpectedly come and alwaysfollowed by some reciprocal sorrow or gravity and he was concerned for them because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew this . He looked at the three he had just come to know and it touched him , their kindness , and his heart was wry with pity for what must come to such nice and such kind people . He coveted their affection , their ease , and their incomprehensible happiness . " You 're going to be a doctor too ? " Mrs. Boone asked . " Yes , " said Luke eagerly , come to a world he knew . " Yes , I am going to be a doctor . " " You and Alfred . But why ? " she asked suddenly . " What is there about Medicine that attracts you , Luke ? " He looked at them shyly , as always nonplussed , unable to form a sentencewhich would explain clearly to himself how urgent the reason was and how watery the words , an ocean of words , each word a wave , the waves slipping one into another . " Alfred 's a joiner , " Mrs. Boone said . " If there 's a club or a fraternity Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred wants to join . " " Listen to her ! " said Alfred . They looked at Luke . They saw a pale young man , the skin a little moist with nervousness , drably dressed , thin , peering at them nervously , anxiously , and uncertainly . There is in most young men the bloom of the year 's youth behind them and the mold and set of the year in which they find themselves . On Lucas there was set boy and young man , and the spirit between wavered , made no choice , remained still , waited for further instruction . He is a handsome thing . Mrs. Boone looked at Luke searchingly . Lovely eyes . Girls are going to like that mouth , the curve of that lower lip , the little line of cruelty there  --  is it cruelty there at the corners ? No mother , poor darling . Pity his father was too busy to come with him . So young . And something in him so old . Something hard , something far beyondAlfred . Force for himself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes ! And she looked away then at Alfred . He 's got to get out of himself , Mr. Boone decided . Alfred 'll take care of that . Otherwise he 'll sit in corners . That 's his type . Nice-looking kid . Too shy , though . Goes beyond shyness. 86He is n't what I had in mind , Alfred thought philosophically . Lookslike a student . Oh , well ! I 'll have fun elsewhere , and I 'll study with him . No trouble , though . . . that 's one thing . . . . He wo n't hurt me , Lucas thought , peering sidelong at Alfred 's face , his large nose , his short brown hair , his thin , angular and tall frame . Theimpact of these three friendly persons eddied warmly toward him and he abandoned an outpost of his reserve . " I 've always wanted to be a doctor , " he blurted . There was a faint check in the flow of conviviality . It was as if he hadshown an arm suddenly naked that ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always ? " echoed Mrs. Boone . Luke nodded . He was alone , again . Somehow he had gone too far . That night Lucas found the darkness comforting . It hid him , it protectedhim , it made all one . Again the feeling of strangeness , of being astranger from an outer world , came over him as he thought of Mr. andMrs . Boone , these parents , these parent quantities , these solid , warm , protecting and protected , these at-ease people . His wondering slowed . He drowsed in the nearness of sleep . Heroused abruptly . His belly was hard with sudden excitement . He was come to the beginning . A wave of friendship for the creature in the other bed who would share this college living , this great adventure , who was himself , his own counterpart except that his manners were different , who now dreamed the same dreams , made him secure , made him not alone , and he drowsedand sleep washed him warmly onto the dark reaches of unconsciousness . In the morning he registered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long wait , " he said dubiously when registering was over . " Two years ? " said Alfred incredulously . " Why , it 'll be over like that ! Then the real work begins ! " " Chemistry and physics and math and history and English  --  what do we need all that for ? " Lucas despaired . " That 's what makes it so long . Why ca n't we just take what we 'll need in Medicine  --  and that 's all . We could do it in eight months ! " " All I know is we 've got two beautiful soft years to play . " " Two years ! " " You act like you want to start Medicine right now ! " " I 've been studying with doctors , " Lucas confided . " The hell you have ! " " All that history and English and stuff  --  " " That makes you a gentleman , my boy . A gentleman and a scholar and a college man . " " All I want to be is a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to do like the man said  --  spend the next three days getting acquainted with our fellow convicts . " " Let 's walk around , first . " " Hell , the buildings will be there . We 'll see enough of them ! Got ta make contacts , son ! " 87He walked with Lucas over the campus . Lucas consulted the small printed map of the university . " Let 's go this way ! " " Wonder where that guy came from  --  looks like a South American . ... There 's a guy dressed like a college man , that 's a sophomore , sure ! ... Boy , look at him ! . . . " Alfred examined the humans about him with interest and absorption . Lucas pressed on . At the medical buildings Lucas stopped , open-mouthed . He drew a deep sigh . Alfred looked at him quickly . " Is this what you wanted to see ? " " Look ! " " It looks just like the rest ! " The brick walls of the medical college rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas , remote as Carcassonne . Alfred shifted embarrassedly . " Look at those guys going in and out , " he said tactfully , hoping no one would notice Lucas staring thus . " Older fellows , are n't they ? Boy , they got a grind . And do they know it ! Look at those faces . " Lucas gaped at the privileged and ordained , passing quickly and silentlyin and out of the medical-college buildings . They talked to each other soberly , in low voices , their foreheads were creased anxiously . That older man , that adult , was surely a professor , and as he watched , the students divided respectfully to let him pass ; at the other college buildingshe would have been jostled unceremoniously . " Two years ! " Lucas murmured , shaken . " Long enough ! Come on ! We 've seen it ! We got work to do . We got to get acquainted . Let 's go where we belong ! " Slowly and unwillingly Lucas moved away , looking to the last , hungeringfor the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to room , making friends , selecting carefully , casting his lot among his own . Obediently , Lucas followed him . They found their eating hall , they moved leisurely about the athletic fields , strolled to the nearby town . On the way Alfred picked up a small covey of other young men . Gradually , Lucas drifted to the outside of the group . Next day Lucas left Alfred to further acquaintance making . He walked about the entire university . In an hour he was loitering again outside the medical buildings . Late in the afternoon , emboldened by familiarity , he sat on the steps of one of the buildings , straining his ears to catch a stray word from the passing students , words in the Language . Later , he loitered about the hospital , watching patients enter , trying to guess their ailments , watching the doctors drive up at the rear , seeing the brisk , white hustling of nurses . In the months to come he would linger and hunger often . Occasionallya medical student would greet him , and he would thrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medical student would discover that he was an outlander and mumble awkwardly and walk on . And Lucas would stare after him , gratefully . Two years. 88But he was in college . Now he was here . Nothing would ever break his hold . There were some of his fellows who in after life , triggered by certain memories , would leaf with thickened fingers through their recollections and , like a man pawing his pocketbook for a weathered snapshot , produce a happy memory of a happy college life , a single feeling that summed it all , an involuntary smile at the memory of play , of young being young among young . There would be a few , like Lucas , who in after years and as long as they lived would remember college as their home , the first loved home since their birth , the home they preferred to all homes , all caves , all parents , all rules , organizations , hearths , cradles , and hunting packs on the planet . In this place , subject to a few simple rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his nights too , if he liked , it was all up to him , his mind a hone on which his vector sharpened , studying fiercely and endlesslyand implacably , deliriously free to follow the direction of his force . Alfred , who took the same subjects , studied little , threw his books impatientlyaside , dressed himself with great care and fled . Once or twice during the first week , estimating guiltily that Lucas was either poor or shy , he was on the point of speaking , of inviting Lucas to go with him , he had almost lipped the words into the air . He checked himself each time . Lucas ' face , studying , was unconcealed pleasure . It was inconceivable , seeing him , that he could be happier . They were very friendly . They liked each other . They were very cheerful together , they became good friends quickly . And Alfred waited patiently for the day when Lucas would be bored with study , when fatiguewould provide him with an opportunity to show Lucas the world . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alfred was a human without a visible plan and without any goal . He was not troubled by the differencesbetween them . Long ago he had found that life as other boys lived it was not his . In their first days together he was frightened for Alfred and amazed by him . To Alfred each hour of the day was an hour for play , each momentthat could be borrowed or stolen or preempted . He played even in classes . He made the most of his freedom . Little by little Lucas realized that most of the boys at college were like Alfred . The college went comfortably on , the days , the weeks passed . There was no day of reckoning . When Alfred fell behind , as he frequentlydid , Lucas was relieved to loan him his notes , to work with him . Helping Alfred made him part of the cosmogony of youth , of the youth around him , of the circle he contacted but inside whose circumference he did not live . He felt no superiority . He felt a difference between himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not feel set apart by it ; it was his relation to the group . Little by little Alfred drifted out of his life and out of his considerations . They slept in the same room , they were warm and friendly to each89other , they lost their sense of unease and difference . They went their separate ways . All about him swarmed the life of the college , the young men garbed ritually , speaking ritually of prescribed things , laughing a prescribed laughter , frowning with a prescribed contempt , the young men of the family Hominidae , jealous of their ritual , chosen young men , proudly alert to preserve their difference from the unchosen and from the world from which they had come and from the world into which they were destined , tightly organized chauvinists of prescribed youth , warriors for a four-year custom , the traditionless given a tradition . When he first came Lucas felt himself an outsider . He walked humblyand looked about him anxiously . He knew no rules and he was selfconsciouswith the constant fear of offending , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that almost all the other young men who had been admitted with him walked as gingerly as he walked and were as apprehensive . Alfred was never apprehensive . Alfred had no fears . Alfred was serene . " It 's easy ! " he comforted Lucas . " Do as the others do . That 's all there is to it . Just do as they do . " The uniform was simple and it was within the reach of even the pooreststudents . It consisted simply of battered and dirty white shoes with very thick soles , a rumpled raincoat , shirts with buttoned-down collar tabs , trousers of one color and coats of another . No one wore hats . In a short time he was dressed in this uniform , and now in classes , as he moved about the campus , as he attended the excited rallies of youth , he felt himself to be indistinguishable from the rest . He relaxed . He obeyed the rules youth made for youth . But there were also ritual noises , ritual thoughts , ritual attitudes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual forays into the terrain of the adult , into the privileges of adult warriors , which includeddrink , marriage practice , communal smoking , and tribal conference . And in the vicinity of these things Lucas remained self-conscious , mindful of an audience and aware that while the population of the collegepresented to the outside world the appearance of a tribe there were little lonely islands in it . And these islands remained lonely and apart . And he knew forlornly that he was one of these islands . He was one of a few dozen such islands , a youth incapable of youth on the common terms of youth . They saw each other in libraries , inspected each other furtively , spoke rarely and stiffly to each other , fearful of being identified for what they were . They came to know each other by sight , to be able to recognizethemselves in occasional newcomers . They kept to themselves . They hoped not to be noticed . Sometimes in the evenings Lucas thought of Ouida and wondered where she had gone . The impact of her living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he knew she was dead . But the impact of Ouida was so strong that he did not think of death seriously in connection with her . She was gone. 90The mosaic of mother-days moved across his memory , the face of Ouida , the feel of her , the sound of her voice . But each time his memory was imperceptibly less keen , the sharp stone become rounded pebble . He longed to be as other boys , to think their thoughts , to have their horizons , to be friends , to have friends , to be one with this enormous family . There was not a week when he was not hurt in some little way or some great way by being excluded , by a casual look , by a conversationmade across him as though he were not there , by parties organized in his presence to which he was not invited . At these times he would remember Dr. Kellogg , or Dr. Alexander , orDr . Dwyer , and the long hours sitting on the steps , waiting for the sound of the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and happy world . It was very real and to enter it was like turning a page in a worn and much readbook . It was a place to which he could return at will , a place of need , a sanctuary . One day , when he had been in college nearly five months , he put aside his studies early and walked to the town . He loitered from street to street inspecting shop windows . From time to time he saw other college boys . For the most part they were in groups or in pairs and they were obviouslyabroad on errands . They talked animatedly , an aura of excitement and pleasure in their very walk . Lucas listened avidly . He tried to understand their excitement , to be excited himself . They were completely absorbed in their errand . They were delighted with what they were doing and they were one with each other . If he could just learn the secret , Lucas yearned , if he could overhearsome word , see some action , some gesture , the whole structure of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with them . He did not seriously consider the possibility that total absorption in socks could ever root itself in his living and outlook and become part of him . He wanted only to perfect himself in the appearance of interest so that he could pass muster as one of them , be a unit in the organized army ofyouth about him , enjoy their games , have their fun , and , even not enjoying , still be part , undetected and unchallenged . It was quickly over . The three went out , talking loudly , headed onsome absorbing errand elsewhere . The clerk walked slowly to Lucas . " Interested in some ties ? " " Some socks , maybe , " Lucas said hopefully . He felt bold . " And what size ? " Lucas obediently balled his fist and held it out to the clerk . The clerklooked at it a moment , surprised , then picked up a pair of socks , wrapped it around the fist , tried another pair . " That 'll be eleven . Any particular color ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be twelve dollars . " The clerk turned to wrap the socks . Lucas flinched . Then , resolute to pay the price of fellowship , he put his hand in his trouser watch pocket . The pocket was empty . He had lost his summer wages . He had somehow lost forty dollars . He stared at the clerk in horror . In the next instant he was sick with shame . " Oh , wait a minute ! " he faltered . The clerk turned . " I just thought91 " Too many , " Lucas said . " You got enough  --  " " Plenty for all ! " Alfred protested , his head turned to Lucas , his body walking after Travis , Ellways , and Latimer . " You go ahead , " Lucas said . " I 'll see you later . " " Try the Goodhue Candy Shop ! " Alfred admonished . " It 's always loaded  --  I ' 11 see you  --  I 'll see you back in the room  --  " He hurried after the others . The girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone again . He walked on . He lingered outside the windows of clothing stores looking at the clothes there , clothes that belongeduncompromisingly to young men of another world . Now with the loss of the forty dollars he was incomparably poorer . He sighed and walked on . Now he studied tobacconists ' shops , studied the pipes , looked curiously at the brown heaps of tobacco , read the exotic names . Then there were shoe shops and he peered at the smart shoes , hopelessly expensive , made to be scuffed to the college pattern . For as long as he could remember Ouida had made taking care of clothing an article of faith . He came to a book store . He felt at home , he had a right here . He looked at the books in the rack outside , fearlessly picked one up , examined it , casually set it back . He lingered here some time . No clerk came out . Reluctantlyhe walked on . It was getting late . He had missed dinner . He turned toward the campus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimly the familiar buildings , the gravelled walks . In the gloom he began the long trudge toward Saylor Hall . The college streets were dark now , and deserted . He saw other figures only occasionally . He walked on into the night . To his right he heard suddenly the soft sound of music . He looked ahead . Lighted windows made a golden halo in the night . It was a fraternity house . Concealed in the darkness he walked toward it . He peered furtively at the windows . Inside a group of young men crowded about a piano . They were singing together , a hymn of youth , a hymn of being together , inarticulate with song , rapt , lost in happiness , their arms about each other 's shoulders . Now the night was more lonely and he stood solitary , a small figure in the empty darkness . A new song began . He walked on . The darkness of the campus enfoldedhim . The sound of singing dwindled . In a few more paces the light was gone . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ahead was the dark bulk of Saylor Hall . He climbed the granite stairway . In his room a letter from Dr. Alexander was waiting : " Hope you are getting along all right , but knowing how much this means to you I am sure you are . I do n't know whether this will help or not , at least not right now , but some time ago I promised you a letter of introduction to a former classmate and here it is . His name is Grover Aarons , and he is full professor of pathology at the medical college . Might drop in on him and make yourself known . You remember that farmer with the wen on the side of his neck ? Finally took it out last week and found a needle embedded in the tissue alongside . Said he swallowed it when he was ten years old . All good wishes and we expect great things of you . Sincerely , George Alexander , M.D. " of something . . . " He started edging toward the door . " I better look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right color . . . I just remembered  --  I 'll be right back  --  " He wrenched the door open . He smiled , red-faced . He nodded reassuringly . He was through the doorway , he was on the sidewalk , he was safe . He walked rapidly away . Not daring to look back he turned the first corner . Two blocks later he halted before another shop window . He glanced covertly about . He was not being observed . He sighed . He walked slowly on . He could still feel the clerk 's eyes . He heard a hail , his own name called . He looked around , startled . Alfred was striding toward him , beaming , trailed by three other young men , strangers . " Where you been , boy ? What you up to ? " Alfred slapped the point of his shoulder . " Just looking around . " A warm wave of companionship and gratitudestiffened Lucas . " Looking ' em over , huh ? " He turned to the three . " You see ? A fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out picking ' em over . Hell , boy ! I figured you 'd be back studying ! " " Seen anything ! Any poontang ? " " No good just walking the streets , boy , " Latimer said kindly . " We 've tried that . " Imagine old Luke out cruising with the best of ' em ! " Alfred said proudly . " You get much ? " Latimer asked anxiously . " Maybe he 's tapped a lode ! These deep , quiet boys you never know ! " " Not a thing , " Lucas said earnestly . " Not a one . " " We 're organized , " Alfred said . " Travel in packs , that 's the only way . System . Latimer 's the sex fiend , old man experience . Ellways is the big broad athletic type . " Tall and rangy Ellways grinned self-consciously . " Travis is the clothes department . " Travis smiled serenely , beautifully and faultlessly dressed , careful and careless . " And I 'm just a big-brother , joiner type . Ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He could be the country-cousin type , " Ellways said earnestly , noddingat Lucas . " The fellow a girl has to trust , " pondered Latimer . " Come on in , " Alfred urged enthusiastically . " I will ! " Lucas said gratefully . " Sure ! " said Travis . A pair of girls passed , talking animatedly , pretending to ignore the group . " Hey ! " called Latimer . One of the girls turned her head and looked at the group coldly . Lucas shrank guiltily . " How do you do , how do you do , how do you do ! " called Ellways . The girl stared at them indignantly , tossed her head , said something to her companion . They giggled and walked on . Lucas looked about uncomfortably , agonizedly sure the whole street was watching . " Well come on , come on ! " cried Alfred . Latimer was already walking toward the retreating girls , followed by Travis . Lucas hung back . " Hey ! " Alfred stopped . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R 11He came into the hospital , the first he had ever entered . He looked about him acolyte-hungry , and all about him was the incense of the temple , the smell of formaldehyde and alcohol , of mercury and iodine and a hundred other chemicals , all subtly blended , suspended , linked to tissue and blood and bone and the skin of man and his inmost fluids . It was not a boy , not a young man standing there on stones the namelesshad joined with cement , the forgotten had quarried . It was spirit , the inner drive of man , of this one man , spirit born and aged in the birthinstant , spirit without years and beyond time , and this stood waiting for the vessel of flesh in which it was contained to carry it forward to the world in which it could be God . He stood inside the hospital for the first time and what he saw and what he felt , all of this took no second , no interval , but a soul 's time , a time without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as all the lives of such as he that had ever been lived before him . He found his way to the office of Grover Aarons . Grover Aarons , who began life as a Yeshiva student faraway in New York 's crowded Williamsburgsection , studying Talmudic law , studying , arguing interminably the points some sharp Jew might one day throw at him and he a rabbi and unless he argued now unable to answer that black day . And in the middle of it , well on his way to become a rabbi , he was troubled for an inner speaking . It did not come all at once , but gradually , pushing hard against the vessel of himself until he had to listen . And more or less , a little here , a little now and a little then , so kill him for it , he had always kind of half wanted , maybe  --  oh , it was an impulse , probably , just an interest  --  he had always wanted to become a  --  let us say it  --  to fool around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about  --  well , to study Medicine . And the day came , the middle of his becoming a rabbi , when graduallystopped and imperative began . And if he was an ocean the waves of him heaved , the storms tore , the typhoons reared , the tumult was like death , like a loved one dying that must be prevented , must be held back , shriek , pray , clutch , scream , weep , beg , grovel . And then let go . And he let go . And they let go . All about him let go . And he was dead . And he left the Yeshiva and went to school to become a doctor . Well , and now he was a doctor , and all he had to do was become an intern , only Jews do n't just pick a hospital and at Jewish Hospital there were already too many Jews , and he got in anyway , and then he went away . He did n't set up a practice . He wanted to practice Medicine , not to heal Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever Medicine he wanted , and to do that he had to find some spot on the planet , some spot in the country on the planet where he was nationed , where they seldom thought about Jews , where they thought about Jews just a little . He came to this backwoods where few people had ever seen a Jew and did n't really know one if they saw one and had only a tribe 's , a commu-94nity 's , distrust of a newcomer . And after a year of practice , of no practice at all , he applied for a teaching job at the university . And now he had been there ten years . Now he was professor of pathology . Now he had nothing to do with patients . Now he had only to do with the tissues of patients , of what made them die . Now he had only to do with Medicine . With the books and the instruments and the tissues on which it practices . And what geist he had , what vector , urge , impulse , soul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathway developed , and he became a pathologist , not just a name , not just a function , but all its eating , living , and breathing , thinking , dreaming , and aspiring entity . He was forty-four . He was five feet four inches , he weighed one hundred and sixty-two pounds , he was small-boned , his hair was brown and crisp , his eyes were gray , his face was a pointed oval , his hands were pale again , his face was lined to laugh at himself , his eyes were lined to be rueful , to be wary , to be angry before the blow , to laugh in relief . He looked at Lucas and his first thought was that here was a student who was about to fail and who had come to plead with him . And the secondthought was that he would be easy on him , he was no enemy , he was harmless , he was plainly frightened , desperate , cornered , intense , and it mattered horribly . He would be easy on him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit down . " Grover Aarons waved his hand , opening the envelope . Lucas , sitting , watched him read . He came to the end , began halfway again and read to the end again . Then he studied the desk a moment , put down the letter , looked up at Lucas and smiled . " Wanted to be a doctor long ? " " As long as I can remember . " " Some doctors make a lot of money . Every man owes it to himself to get security , to lay it up for the day when he can do his own research . There 's money in Medicine . . . honest money . . . there 's no questionof it . . . Lucas looked away in embarrassment . " Yes , sir , " he said . " Every man 's got his heart fixed on a sum . A certain sum . How much money do you think you 'll need ? " " I do n't know . . . I never thought of it . . . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have to make money . . . And Aarons thought , All right , he 's not in it to make money . It is n't money he wants . All right , it 's not money . " Kind of small place , Milletta . . . " Yes , sir . " " No hospital ? " " No , none . Sometimes Dr. Alexander puts a patient up at his house . Not often . Children mostly , after a tonsillectomy  --  " " Farmers make money too . They must make money or there would n't be three doctors in such a small town . But a lot of fellows , me included , do n't like farming , never would make a farmer . I guess it 's easy to get bored in a small town . All farm kids seem to try to break loose , get away , go to the cities . Any profession must look glamorous to them . " 95 " Maybe so . . . I never thought of it quite like that  --  do many of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them do at that . " " Maybe veterinary doctors . " All right , thanks for saving my face . All right , so it is n't glamor , it is n't **32;8271;TOOLONG , it is n't not-be-a-farmer . Whatever it is I 'll be easy on you , you tried to put me at ease , that was kind , " maybe veterinary doctors , " you were trying to help me out . It is n't money , then , and it is n't running away and it is n't the lure of glamor and position . " I guess a few of them do become vets , at that . That 's probably it . I would n't have thought of it . You say this is the first hospital you 've been in ? " " Yes , sir ! " " Kind of exciting , eh ? What did you think of it ? " Lucas looked at him , his eyes shining . He smiled . " Really liked it , eh ? It does that to all of us . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands  --  there 's something about a doctor , learned , wise , clad in white wisdom , the ancient robe of the seer  --  healing in his hands  --  intellect in his eyes , the eyes of the world on him , pleading , hoping against hope , and the doctor is the last resort , awful as Jove , the right hand of God , to give and to take , the last appeal . " Yes , sir . " " Does n't it ever hit you that way ? " " Yes , sir . " " Does n't the prospect of your being one of these doctors thrill you , exalt you ? Is n't it a great prospect ? " " Yes , sir , " Lucas said dutifully . All right , so it 's not drama , it 's not money , not escape , not position . We 're coming to it , my boy . We 're narrowing it down . You have n't got many left . " Of course there 's some of us who just like to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of the greatest discoveries that have ever been made have come from people like that  --  spending days and weeks and nights and years over a lonely table in a laboratory , failing , starting again , failing , starting again , never quitting , learning , always learning . Learning for the sheer sake of learning . That 's one of the things that grips any medical man through and through . You like to study ? " " I love it , sir . Medical study . " " The more you study the more you 'll find that all study is medical study  --  all learning is learning , it 's an apple for every man 's bite . Engineers , farmers , doctors , musicians  --  they 're all nibbling at the same apple . That 's what you like , eh ? " " Yes , sir . " " It 's a good thing you do . Now let 's take something else . Now of them all which do you like best ? " " Which do I like best  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ones I 've mentioned ? " Lucas moved uncomfortably . " All of them draw you equally ? Come now ! " " Well , not money . I need money  --  but not money . Not to become a doctor just because of money . No , sir . But all the rest . " And those are just words that cover the surface . They tell something of what you feel about something but they 're just terms of agreement . So I feel all that . And I say yes . Because there is n't any other word I know that says yes and means the whole iceberg and not just the tip that 's showing . And it 's all that , all you 've said . " Only there 's something more , " he blurted . " Some specialty  --  some special field  --  a brain surgeon , maybe  --  " Dr. Aarons said gently . " No  --  I do n't know yet  --  maybe there would be a field . But I do n't think so . Not one field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's healing  --  " " You feel pity , you ca n't help yourself  --  " I 'll say yes . But I do n't mean pity . " I 'm going to be honest . I do n't feel much pity ... " " Well , you do n't cure patients with pity  --  " " I want to heal , all right . That 's true . That 's pity , maybe . It 's more like seeing a picture hanging crooked on the wall and itching to straighten it and no matter what happens you must straighten it  --  " " Whether it 's a chromo or a Rembrandt  --  " " It does n't matter . And it 's something else . I used to feel it when I 'd ride with the doctors on calls , Dr. Alexander , mostly , he took me more than the rest . It was interest , that 's an awful word , I do n't know the word , it 's something more , something you have to do  --  because  --  because  --  " " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a cow gives milk  --  " " That 's right ! That 's it ! It 's for you . It is you ! It 's your whole everything , it 's what you do because  --  " He looked at Dr. Aarons helplessly . " Because it comes from inside . Because all the rest comes from the outside to the inside  --  money , position , dramatics , study for the sake of study , all the rest are surface things to which you react . But this is reactionitself , produced of itself , produced when you start living and your genes tell you : ' Go ! ' " " Yes , sir , " said Lucas gratefully . " That 's it , is n't it ? " " Yes , sir . . . and more . . . " Yes . . So that 's it . One in ten million . One in a hundred million . That 's two I 've seen . I 'm forty-four , now , and that 's two . So that 's it . You poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thing , you nebulae of genes and God knows what , you 're for it , you bastard , you do n't know it , but you 're for it . Why did n't you give it to me , God ? Instead of only a piece of it ? Just enough to recognize it in somebody else ? What 'll he do with it ? Look what I 've suffered and I 've only got a piece of it ! Look at that lucky young , ignorant , shiny-eyed , look at that , look . And in this silence Lucas looked at Dr. Aarons respectfully . " That pre-med . . . " he ventured deprecatively . " The pre-med ? Yes , the pre-med . Yes . What you want to do is plunge9796right in . But you have to know how to talk , after all . A doctor is a gentleman . Culture is important . Two years is n't much . You 're almost through your first , right now . Tell me  --  what did you say your father did ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness maker ? Are they still making harness ? In this day and age ? Who would have believed it . " " He does n't make it , sir . He sells it . " " Enough to see a fellow through medical school anyway ! " " Oh yes , sir ! " " Harness stores ! And all I see is automobiles ! Tell me , is that a good business , harness ? Has n't it fallen off ? Surely it 's fallen off a little ! " " You never can tell with Dad . This time next week he may have a dozen of them ! " " He sounds like a clever man ! " " Oh , he is ! There 's no stopping him . " " And your mother ? Ah ! . . . I 'm sorry . I 'm very sorry . " It was recent . The eyes were still raw with it . " Well , you 're all fixed then . I 'm glad of that . To tell the truth I was worried about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I did . But you ca n't do it any more . And I only did part way . But you ca n't even do that now . It was almost impossible then . But now  --  it 's impossi-ble . " Now I 'm trying to frighten him . He 's frightened already . What do I want of his life ? Can he help being what he is , what I remember ? And with a father , God forbid , in the harness business . " You say this is your first visit to a hospital ? Come on . We wo n't see everything , but I 've got to go upstairs anyway . " The first impact for Lucas was the first sight , the first floor , the first corridor , the first wheeled stretcher , the first glimpse into corridored rooms , the first white uniforms , the first wasted faces , the first smells , the first sense of another order , another system , another law . After that first impact the next corridors and the next rooms , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were only successions upon an undigestedfirst . On the top floor there were no patients , only a long corridor and a corridor joining this at right angles , making a T. The bar of the T were the operating rooms . " That 's where the mechanics work , " Dr. Aarons sniffed . Lucas smiled obediently . He stared . " That 's what the movies play up . " Dr. Aarons paused to let Lucas look . " In there is high drama , men in white fighting swiftly against death , flashing knives , blood flowing , mystery . In there is where little boys with pocket knives and thread do the same things over and over , by rote , like mechanics . " Lucas smiled appreciatively , the smile covering a defensive feeling towardsurgeons . He was troubled . Now he sensed that in the temple there were sects and that one sect rivalled another . He felt suddenly adult and self-conscious . " Up to about a hundred years ago doctors ranked first and surgeons were barbers , " he said righteously. 98 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas . " That 's right ! Where did you learn that ? " He was very pleased . " I read it . I read it in some medical history . " " How long have you been reading that kind of stuff ? " " Medical books ? Since I was eight or nine . The doctors in Milletta used to loan me some . I read all I can get . " " Anything special ? Or whatever you can get your hands on ? " " It 's hard to get any kind of medical book . I just read what I can get . " Dr. Aarons walked on again . " I 'll see what I can do for you . " They reached the end of the corridor . Here there were two doors , one marked " Laboratory , " and the other " Pathologist . " " Here 's where I hang out . " They entered a wonderland of gleaming glass , bent in fantastic shapes , crystal-thin , fat and swelling , incredibly complicated instruments , scales , fluids green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , formally labelled , formally brown . Lucas ' eyes rounded . He sucked in a quick breath . Dr. Aarons glanced at him sidelong . " Full of junk , " he shrugged . " Everything 's a mess . " Lucas looked at him incredulously . " Got to be cleaned up , " Dr. Aarons grumbled . He walked to a table , picked up a tall beaker , glanced at the contents critically , set it down . " What 's that , sir ? " " That ? " Dr. Aarons turned back carelessly . He picked up a pronged instrument , fished in the graduate , brought up a dripping chunk of tissue . " Liver . Got to section it sometime tomorrow . " Lucas stared . Dr. Aarons dropped the tissue back into the graduate . " Make a slice of it  --  here  --  " he walked to the microtome and put a careless , loving hand on it  --  " freeze it with this  --  " he dropped his hand to the carbon-dioxide tanks  --  " mount the frozen section  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " stain it  --  " he pointed to a row of bottles over a sink  --  " put it under the microscope . " The microscope , the research microscope , resembledno microscope Lucas had ever seen . It was a breathless beauty , the very light which served it was a unit as large as the brass tubes he had until this moment regarded so reverently in Dr. Alexander 's office back in Milletta and thought the final word in scientific wonder . Dr. Aarons was watching him intently and casually . " Ever seen a tissue slide ? " Lucas looked at him helplessly . Deftly , Dr. Aarons slipped a slide into the graduated scale prongs , in almost the same motion flipped on the lights . Out of the black , crackled finish of the light box a cylinder of intense light bridged the two instruments . For a moment Dr. Aarons fiddled negligently with the adjustmentknobs , peering through the microscope . He straightened abruptly . " Here ! " Gingerly , Lucas bent to look . " You 'll have to keep both eyes open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to learn . " For a moment Lucas could see nothing . And then suddenly the field leaped out at him , a paralyzing wonder of purple , shading to red , an in99finity of pattern , lines sharply defined , unmistakably cells . His head jerked up . He stared at Dr. Aarons . " Cancer , " Dr. Aarons said briefly . " Those are kidney cells . Look like nails , do n't they ? " I 've seen cancer . Lucas trembled with happiness . I 've seen cancer and a human kidney . I 've seen it ! I 've seen it ! I 've got to remember ! But Dr. Aarons was walking toward the door . Lucas followed reluctantly . " That 'll give you some idea . Here 's the stink lab . " They entered a large room . Two women and a young man about three years older than Lucas looked up . The women were seated at microscopes . Nearby the young man was tending to distillation apparatus . Here too , wherever Lucas looked , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marvellous machinery , the pungent odor of bitter chemicals . " This is Miss Dorchester  --  Miss Jeanette  --  Mr. Ahrlquist . " They smiled , waited , looking at Lucas . " This is Lucas Marsh , young fellow sent by an old classmate . Doing pre-med now . Expect to have him with us soon . " Ahrlquist turned back to work . The women waited . " Pleased to know you , " Lucas mumbled . " Been showing him the wonders of science , " Dr. Aarons said carelessly . " What did that blood picture show ? " " High eosinophile , fast sed rate . " Miss Dorchester smiled . Lucas blinked . Her self-possession , the glibness with which she , a woman , a female , talked to Dr. Aarons on his own terms , was privy to the same knowledge , confused him . Her fine , reddish-blond hair wisped softly out of control about her triangular face , framed the prominent cheekbones , made her eyes more blue , her straight nose thinner , softened her wide , rather thin-lipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiled friendlily , and turned back to her microscope . " Going to have a late blood sugar for you today , Ruth , " Dr. Aarons said cheerily . And Ruth Dorchester looked up from the microscope , her shoulders sagged and she looked at Dr. Aarons in dismay . " Oh , no ! " " That 's the third this week ! " Miss Jeanette protested . " Why late ? Why are they always late ? " Miss Dorchester was twenty-seven years old , but Miss Jeanette was thirty-six , and where Miss Dorchester was slim and as tall as Lucas , Miss Jeanette was of middle height and overweight . Her hair was black and her oval , kind , plain face had long ago given up the look a woman wears for suitors and the possible . " We 'll never get home . Always at the last minute ! " " How about Ahrlquist giving you a hand  --  " " I 'm tied up on this alkaloid determination ! " Ahrlquist said quickly and stubbornly . He was a thin and weedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility in his tone the women looked quickly away from him back to Dr. Aarons . " Somehow you always manage to have some long-winded test under way when something like this comes up , do n't you ? " Dr. Aarons said wearily . " You want me to drop it ? " There was a faint note of contempt in Ahrlquist 's voice . " Get it over with , " Dr. Aarons sighed . " I 'm sorry , girls . " " Very glad to have met you ! " Ruth Dorchester 's clear , high voice reached Lucas , who had turned with Dr. Aarons . " And you , too . " Lucas whirled clumsily . But she had returned to her microscope and , belatedly , he turned again and followed Dr. Aarons out of the laboratory . " Come back anytime , " Dr. Aarons said . " My liver is calling me . You can find your way out all right ? " " Oh , sure  --  I 'll be  --  " " Wait ! I forgot ! " He turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to loan you some books . " Inside the room he looked at a bookshelf crowded with fat medical tomes . He paused in simulated vexation . " Pathology be all right ? " he asked Lucas apologetically . " Oh , fine , fine ! " Lucas breathed . " Well , I thought I had some others  --  but here 's two  --  you might look them over  --  should be a later edition  --  but you 'll get something out of them "  --  he handed them to Lucas and smiled full at him , friendlily  --  " with your background . " Lucas ' eyes dimmed . " Thank you ! I keep saying thank you , but  --  " " Just bring them back when you 're through . " The door closed . Lucas was alone in the corridor . He walked slowly , lingering . At the landing he looked back once at the laboratory door , then walked quickly to the floor beneath . An orderly moved swiftly and silently toward him , pushing a wheeled stretcher , on the stretcher a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . From the mound came the odor of ether . At the point where the blanket ended there was a waxen , unconscious face had been sent there , it would be recalled , it had been opened , its dark secrets had been touched , its life had been handled and put back and sewed up . Now the blanket covered what had been done , and the smell of ether . Down the corridor two nurses bustled , their shoes white , their stockings white , their starched skirts moving crisply . He turned to walk to the main floor . From the corridor in which he had just seen the nurses the crude clamor of shouting rose . He whirled . Down the corridor an emaciated old man fled , shouting , his short gown flapping behind him . Down the corridor rushed an orderly , pursuing . From her desk in an alcove the charge nurse stepped out , her arms wide to stop the oncoming shouter . She turned to Lucas . " Stop him ! " she cried . Lucas scrambled to sustain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never ceasing his wild shouts . An instant later the three were on the floor , Lucas ' books tumbling , and almost immediatelythe orderly had plunged atop the mass . The emaciated man struggledwildly and nakedly , then abruptly his hoarse shouts became low grunts . He subsided . The charge nurse and the orderly led him back down the corridor . " There 's nothing for you here , " the disarrayed nurse called angrily100 101to the patients now standing openly gaping in their doorways . " Go back inside your rooms , please . Shut the door ! " They withdrew reluctantly . Lucas watched the trio enter a room far down the corridor . Panting a little he stooped to pick up his books . He picked up the nurse 's cap also . He brushed at it clumsily and gently . He held it , looking about him , at a loss what to do with it . " Thank you very much . " The charge nurse had swiftly and soundlesslyreturned . She put out her hand , took her cap , and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nakedness . " That 's all right . " Lucas brushed self-consciously at the top of one of the books , suddenly noticed blood smeared on the back of his left hand . He looked up at the nurse . " He cut himself on a screen trying to get out of the window , " she said contemptuously . " You never know when they 're going to break out , good as gold days running and all of a sudden  --  They do n't belong here in the first place ! " she said angrily . " Plus four ! They 're mental cases  --  and that 's where they belong ! " She smoothed down her uniform indignantly . " I 'll wipe that off for you  --  " she looked at the books  --  " Doctor . . . " " That 's all right . " His voice came to him from a distance , he fumbled for a handkerchief , " I 'll get it . " But she had magically produced a square of gauze and the hand he surrendered was clean and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor , " she said again , impersonally , and turned away . Lucas walked shakily down the stairs . Plus four ! That was syphilis ! And plus four ! That was the last stage , that was the stage where it attackedthe spinal cord and central nervous system , syphilis , carried by the bloodstream , the blood fresh on his hand , seeking an entrance , blindly seeking , in the divine order of its unsinning , unmalicious , unalterableinstinct , a scratch , a tiny scratch . Not infectious ! he remetnberedclearly . It came back to him now . Not infectious in that stage . Almostnot infectious at all . A danger to be thought about , to be treasured , and not a danger that could happen , but to treasure . " It does n't pay to be morbid about such things , " Lucas said jubilantly . He said it aloud , walking . He looked about with concern . No one had heard him . It does n't pay at all , he reiterated proudly , silently , this time only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wo n't do . One ca n't be morbid . One handles it , one grows careless . We all run into infection every day , Doctor . One ca n't be morbid about such things ! He walked exultantly from the hospital . He walked down the steps . The odor of the hospital vanished . The fresh air was another world , but he was a doctor walking down the cement steps into this workaday world , and the place of mysteries , where every sound and every movement and every thought was ritual and concise , this enclosure shut from the world was behind him and the doctor walked away from it , the cord which bound him to it stretching thinner and thinner with each step he took , becoming evanescent , then invisible , then somewhere sundering , fading , gone . He felt the weight of the books he was carrying . His spirits lifted , surged up as he looked at them , formal , blue , stamped with gold . And102suddenly he could not wait to get to his room . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strode from the path and sat quickly under a tree . He opened the first book . The words ascended to his mind , incomprehensible , beautiful , more beautiful than any words that could be understood , he read with delight words that were old friends , medical words , medical meanings , medical language , and his fingers stroked lovingly the glossy paper , turned the pages tenderly , with reverent , dreaming care ... . And the man rushed down the corridor toward him , the old man , the thin gray hair flying , the wild , open mouth , the sparse hairs on his unshavenface , the gray lines , and they were on the floor , tumbling , and the thin body wrenching its bones incredibly . And there was blood smeared on the back of his hand . A thin smear of yellow-red blood . " I 'll wipe it for you  --  Doctor ! " He turned to the book hungrily . The wad of bills that were his summer earnings had disappeared without trace . He quailed at the thought of writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determinedly budgeted the ten dollars that remainedto him until the end of the month . In a few days he saw with despair that he had figured badly . Despite his sternest resolves he was spending a dollar a day for food . He was amazed at his lack of resistance and his self-indulgence but his amazement was of little practical use for it was never evoked when he was hungry . It was apparent that the few dollars he had left would not carry him for the next sixteen days , when his allowance would arrive , and after classes on the day he had determined this he went into the town to look for a job . There were no dishwasher jobs . There was a sign in the window of one shabby restaurant , but the proprietor peremptorily told him in the presence of a half-dozen disinterested customers that he wanted no collegekids . Wherever he went , Lucas quickly saw , there was a prejudice against giving jobs to students . He bought a newspaper . At the beginning of his quest he had slunk from shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing on a street corner for all to see . There were very few employment ads . Next day he went to the college administration building and asked for help . They looked at him in astonishment . They explained to him carefully that jobs were spoken for months ahead , that jobs were very scarce , that the town of Winthrop almost never had jobs for college students , having a chronic unemployment problem for its own **25;8305;TOOLONG . He left the building dazed , enviously noting a student-janitor on hisknees scrubbing a flight of steps . He walked toward town again . Hecounted his money . He had four dollars . He walked the streets of Winthrop , trying block after block . When the day ended he had canvassedeven private homes . There were no jobs . There were no jobs anywhere . And his hunger was such , sharpened by the miles he had trudged andhoned by his fear feeling the lonely four bills , that when he had doneeating and turned back toward the campus he had only three dollars left . The next day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the103sign . It stood in the window of an inconspicuous , small and dingy undertakingparlor . The sad-voiced man who opened the door to him nodded glumly when Lucas spoke of the sign in the window . He led Lucas to the display room and vanished in the gloom . Lucas looked cautiously about him . He was surrounded by caskets , their white-satin intestines blooming from sad openings where the polished lid would close , tilted , all of them , in a coquettish curtsy of the foot end so that their yellow , white , pink , and purple blandishment might be fully eyed in the covert glance they knew would be their portion . " Sort of reproach you for being alive , do n't they ? " a voice made Lucaswhirl . A chubby man in his late twenties ran his hands lovingly overthe soft pleated and ruffled comfort a corpse would never feel . - " You come for the job ? " he said . Lucas nodded . " What kind of a job is it ? " he whispered . " What are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apprentice , I guess . " " Gon na live in ? " " I do n't know . I do n't know anything about the job , " Lucas said rapidly . " I need a job  --  " " It 's a beautiful line , is n't it , " the chubby man admired the curtsying caskets and their spilth of foaming velvet . " You see that one over there ? Nobody 'll ever buy that . Twelve hundred dollars . That 's too much . But it 's a show piece . Must have cost all of six hundred , just as she stands . " " You 're an embalmer ? " Lucas asked respectfully . " But this is what I like , " the chubby man said . " Give me a salesman 's job  --  look at this stuff  --  how could you help but buy it . Do you know what the profit is on an item like this ? " He dropped his hand reverently on a sleek brown casket . " That 's a seller . Costs two hundred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them in . " " They need a salesman ? " Lucas asked hopefully . " God , I do n't know what they need . Couple of Guineas running this place now , just bought in , God knows what they want . This is the one I want ! Yes sir , when I go , brother , this is the one for me ! Seven hundred and fifty smackeroos ! " He patted the wooden friend respectfully . " Look at those handles ! " " You 'd have that  --  knowing what they cost ? " " Somebody 's got to pay for them  --  and you ca n't take it with you , " the chubby man said cheerfully . " You a salesman ? " Then he looked past Lucas . A dark woman stood in the doorway . She looked at Lucas searchingly . Then as wordlessly as she appeared she disappeared past the heavy drapes . " Sizing you up , " said the chubby man . " I got to go . Good luck to you . If you want it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The man who had admittedhim reappeared abruptly . " You an embalmer ? Young fellow like you ? " " No , sir , " Lucas said . " Maybe I could be a salesman . I 'm a student . I 'm going to study Medicine . I need a job . I 'd work real cheap  --  " 104The man disappeared while Lucas was talking . This time he was gone only a few minutes . " Missus says no , " he called out in a low tone . " No chance at all ? " begged Lucas . The man stood silently aside . Lucas shivered . He passed through the drapes , he passed the silent man , he felt the black eyes of the woman boringfrom a recess of the dark hallway , there was no sound to his footsteps , the nape of his neck prickled , he opened the door with a jerk , he was outside and down the steps . A mud-stained newspaper floated down the sidewalklike a harlequin , a small breeze dropped it in the gutter . Lucas turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look back . There were no jobs in Winthrop . There were no jobs at the college . For a man who wanted to work part time , and to select the hours he would work , the prospects were simply nonexistent . There were no jobs , at any price , anywhere . Lucas borrowed five dollars from Alfred . Alfred gave him the money without comment . Lucas wrote Job . A few days later Job sent him ten dollars . A few days later he sent him twenty dollars more . Lucas repaid Alfred . Alfred accepted the payment without comment . After this he saw less of Alfred than ever . He walked about Winthrop by himself . He kept his money in his bureau drawer , never going out with more than two dollars in his pockets . Sometimes at nights he went into bars where no one spoke to him , he attended campus concerts , where people who did not know him nodded at him brightly and walked on , he browsed in book stores , he prowled the library , he lingered near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often he spent an idle hour there , surreptitiouslywatching the people who jangled in and out and wondering what they did and where they were going and whether they knew that he belonged to the college too , and perhaps they were classmates . C AFTER 12The school term ended . The campus hived , swarmed , summer plans were buzzed , release was imminent , and youth busied itself deliriously with the coming explosion . On the train bearing him home Lucas looked about him with a new self-possession and a new eagerness . When the train slowed he was waiting in the vestibule . He escaped down the train steps . He was home ! The hot boards under his feet , the familiar station , the cinders , the sign , the shapes , sights , and odors , he embraced them with his senses , his hunger for them unslaked by the contact , made more keen by their promise of home . He looked about him , grinning . Behind him the train moved off . The station , the platform , were deserted . But home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said fiercely . I 'm home ! Hefting his bag he strode heartily toward the center of town and on all sides of him loved things fell into view , the dusty road , the town , the well-remembered stores  --  the harness shop . The door was closed . He105looked through the window . The shop was empty . Charley 's off and Dad 's home , getting lunch  --  home ... . He made himself not run . He walked the remaining blocks with his head lowered . He looked up . The house was before him . He ran up the steps . He forced himself to walk slowly , he bit his lip for pain to compose his features . He rang the bell . I 'm a salesman , he rehearsed rapidly , got a fine line of leather goods , sirHe could hear the bell ring . If Mother was here she 'd say it 's a creditor , he grinned fondly . I 'm a salesman , sir  --  and now he knocked , knocked loud , louder , banged confidently . The grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried the knob . The door did not open . It was locked . He put his bag down . What the hell ! he thought resentfully . He went to the back door . It was locked . He tried the windows , embarrassed . No one noticed him . Now he pushed at them , frankly tugged and pushed . " By God ! " he said aloud . " By God Almighty ! " He strode angrily to the shed , found an old table knife , returned to a window , tried to force the lock . The lock did not give . He jabbed harder , scarring the woodwork , careless , glad to be scarring it . The lock stayed fast . He stood back , hands on hips , panting a little , surveying it . " Well , I 'm going to get in , " he said aloud . " I 'm going to get in and that 's all there is to it ! " He picked up a stick . He weakened . I could go downtown . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to get in ! He raised the stick and smashed a pane . He put in his hand and wrenched the lock open . " There , by God ! " he said grimly . He climbed over the sill . He walked through the house to the front door , opened it , retrieved his suitcase , looked inquiringly up and down the street . The street drowsed emptily . Far down a man slouched along slowly . He brought the suitcase inside the house . It was cool and smelled pleasant and musty . He shut the door . He dropped the suitcase . He looked about him . He drank it in . He was home . He walked through all the rooms , treading the roses of homecoming , feeling the carpet here , the bare floor there , seeing the familiar doors , the woodwork , the rooms , the furniture , all dear to him , spoons , a nail , a table cover , a welcomer , a delight . For a while he sat in the kitchen , resting . Slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then faster and faster the oppression rushed in , the loneliness , the aloneness , the empty house . He leaped up . He went out quickly , strongly , the house behind him . He went to the harness shop . " Your pa 's in Meridian , " said old Charley . " God , you 've growed ! Did n't seem to know you was coming home today . Did n't say nothin ' ! " " I wrote him ! " Lucas said resentfully . " Did n't say a word . " Did n't say a word ! And he knew it ! I wrote him over and over again . Not a word ! Not to tell Charley , even ! " What time do you expect him back ? I went to the house . I had to break a window ! " " By God ! " Charley cackled delightedly . " Broke a window ! Got in , did ya ? No , he ai n't coming back today . Nope . Do n't look for him rightly , till day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quiet street Lucas fought down a sense of shame and resentment , a feeling of rejection , a feeling of being covertly observed and his rejection discussed . He looked about him for sanctuary . He remembered Dr. Alexander . He walked briskly in the direction of the doctor 's office . As he walked he noticed two new stores . Milletta had changed a little . There were more automobiles . There were few horse-drawn vehicles . Ahead of him , from the Milletta Bank building , stepped the familiar figure of Mr. Benjamin . Lucas slowed , hoping he was unnoticed . But Mr. Benjamin had seen him . " Glad to see you , Lucas . Looking fine . Home for the holidays ? " " Yes , sir . About an hour ago . No , two hours  --  " " How 's college ? " " I 'm doing fine , Mr. Benjamin . Yes  --  " " Glad to hear it . Just pay attention to your work and study . We all expect great things from you . That 's right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I beg your pardon ? " " I was just wondering if you 'd seen your father . I was looking for him and  --  " " He 's in Meridian . " " In Meridian ! I see . Yes , well . . . " Charley does n't expect him back today . " " Not today , eh ? How about tomorrow ? " " I think Charley said he 'd be back tomorrow . " " Yes , that 's probably so . Sure . Did he say what time tomorrow ? I mean  --  about ? " " He just said sometime tomorrow . " " I see . . . . Well , I 'm glad to see you looking well , Lucas . Hope to hear fine things of you . Glad to see you home . Good day . " Mr. Benjamin , whatever his errand was , turned and walked back to the bank . It must have been a busy day , Lucas reflected . The banker had been formal almost to the point of queerness . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker 's transparent desire to see Job . But he had been reared in an atmosphere of concern ; whatever it was , his father would maneuver out of it smoothly . People like Mr. Benjamin were his natural prey . He thought of his father as Ouida had thought of him , her outlook on Job was his , now . Out of sight , out of mind , he thought bitterly . I wonder what he 's up to now ? The white square of cardboard was on the doctor 's door . The arrow pointed to " Doctor Out . " Lucas sat on the steps . After a while he rose . There was Dr. Dwyer to visit and Dr. Kellogg . As he had when he was a boy , Lucas strolled through the streets of Milletta seeking the doctors ' carriages . Dr. Dwyer was out . Dr. Kellogg was out . And on the streets of Milletta there were no doctors ' carriagesto be seen . He walked a little further . He looked out over the ribbons of light brown , the empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emptily , except for a sense of desolation , of loneliness , of rebellion , he turned back toward the center of town . He thought of the shop and began to walk faster . Perhaps his father had returned . He reached the shop , breathless . He peered inside . Except for Charley , workingaway on a long strip of leather , the shop was empty . He turned away . He stood uncertainly . The street outside the shop was dusty , the grass died at its edge . He looked unseeingly at the remembered store fronts . This was home . He said it mechanically . I belong here . This is where I 'm supposed to be . Here . He looked about him hopefully . There was neither welcome nor rejection . The day moved impersonally into time . I 've got to go someplace , he said uncertainly . The town . . . the shop . . . the doctors ... and then there was home . Reluctantly , he walked homeward . He saw the empty house again . His steps echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway . The house was somehow stiller . It was emptier than before . It was a house , now . It was wood and plaster and wallpaper . It was a case of wood , full of rooms , smaller than he had remembered them , carpeted , furnished , inanimate , a picture here , a picture there , offering at no one , hanging , an empty house . He looked about him awkwardly . He had a sudden sense of constraint , it was as if he had opened a door and walked into a stranger 's house , walked beyond the front door into forbidden territory , and stood now waiting for someone to appear , surprised to see him standing there . He felt a stranger . " This is my home ! " he said defensively , aloud . He saw on a small table his mother 's picture , an old photograph , a picture of Ouida as a blooming and lovely girl . And at the sight of the stiff cardboard easel , the remembered face , longing and loneliness and yearning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he turned gladly and fled the house . He saw it at last , a small field , stone-fenced , on the edge of town . A breeze moved the quiet grasses and fanned his face . He had been walking very fast . He wiped his wet forehead on the sleeve of his jacket . He walked happily into the cemetery . The cemetery seemed larger than he had remembered it . He walked confidently toward Ouida 's grave . He halted . The gravestones were unfamiliar . He must have taken a wrong turning . He had come to the wrong plot . He looked about him , alarmed . And then two plots away he saw it . A moment later he was standing by his mother 's grave . There was a gravestone there now . " Sacred to the mernory of Ouida Marsh , Beloved Wife and Mother . Born 1880 , Died 1921 . " White stone , new-cut . The tumulus of earth that had pillowed over the form of Ouida was almost flat now . It mounded gently . It was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grass replaced it and there was no line of separation , nothing to show there had not been grass here always , the grass of the cemetery , as far as one could see . Carefully , gently , Lucas sat beside the headstone. 108He tried to think of what she would not know . There was nothing , actually . If she was right , she would know everything . She was here , she was everywhere . Tenderness flooded him at her nearness . After a while , feeling home with her , he raised his eyes , deliberately he forced himself to look at other graves , at the whole cemetery . He looked back at the small mound which covered Ouida . It was unchanged . And yet something had changed it . It was grass , now , part of the cemetery , the mound was identical with other mounds , that which was peculiar to Ouida , to dearness , to the personal , to privacy , to a place set apart , filled with presence , tangiblewith love , was suddenly impersonal . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frantically to regain her . For a moment he succeeded , the place was alive with her , the instant was fragile , it broke , she was gone , he was sitting in an empty place , on earth , on sod , in a place used for a cemetery , beside a headstone , beside a hundred headstones , beside a hundred graves , and the wind , the curious , restless wind , rustled the grasses of all impersonally , the common wind , the common grass , the common sod . He strained desperately to put this from his mind . He strained , aching , for the other feeling , the feeling of Ouida . It was gone . He left the cemetery . He walked back to the empty house . Inside , he waited , looking about him , undecided . He picked up his suitcase . The day rushed through his mind . Step by step , incident by incident , frustration by frustration . " No , by God ! " he cried harshly . He shook with rage . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairway wall . " To hell with you ! " he screamed . " To hell with the lot of you ! " He whirled , then , and walked out , slammed the door behind him , marched to the station , waited a fuming hour , boarded a train back to college . He saw the buildings again with gratitude . He could not wait to be among them . For this was home now . This was all he needed . This was his . This could not be taken from him . This he had made . This was home . CHAPTER 13When the train stopped he had decided clearly what he must do . He alighted impatiently . He faced the bursar confidently , smiling . " I 'm in a kind of pickle , " he confided . He smiled ruefully , a smile at himself , a smile to share with the bursar the way students were always getting into a pickle , always having to run to the bursar , the poor , longsufferingbursar , but what could a young fellow do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lips , acknowledging the gambit . " I was supposed to see Dad today  --  I went all the way home  --  and when I got there he 'd been called out of town . " Lucas halted . He produced an embarrassed smile. 109 " What was it in reference to ? " the bursar said warily , patiently . " Why , you see we 'd agreed on a summer term for me . I wanted to catch up on a lot of stuff we 'll have this fall  --  I 'm taking a pre-med  --  and I 'd  --  we 'd talked it over and instead of wasting the summer he decided , sure , go ahead and take the summer course ! It was only at the last min-ute  --  " " We have n't heard anything from him  --  " The bursar shook his head . " I know ! That was it ! I was to go home , spend a day or so with him  --  you know how it is ! He wanted to see me for at least forty-eight hours ! After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was to give me a check and  --  " " I 'm afraid I do n't see what I can do  --  until  --  " " My goodness ! Can you imagine anyone in their right mind trying to get into summer school when he did n't have to ? " " Yes , " said the bursar . " I can . As a matter of fact  --  " " No ! You 're joking ! Actually conniving ? When they do n't have to ? " " There have been cases  --  " " Honestly ! " Smiling , Luke shook his head in amazement , delighted , bemused , incredulous . " I do n't say we run into it very often , " the bursar conceded , reluctantlyaccepting that Lucas was not one of these . " It 's hard to believe . " Lucas shook his head , his voice trailed off . The bursar now believed him , and Lucas spoke with sympathy , helping the bursar to the next step . " Yes . . . Well , now , in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pencil . He frowned . " I do n't see what we can do . . . We 'd have tohave  --  " " Gosh ! Now I am in a pickle ! You 've been so understanding and kind , when I first came here  --  and I thought , well , it is a problem but if anybody can help you , that 's Mr. Johnson . So I came right to you . There 's nobody home and I came all the way back knowing matters were all arranged and here I am . And I  --  " He shook his head helplessly . He smiled a smile that was not a smile , that was just not tremulous . The bursar cleared his throat . " I appreciate your position . I 'd like to help you . But you see  --  " " Gosh ! " " If you had a letter , even , anything that would give us something to go by , some formal expression of intention  --  " " A letter ! " Lucas shook his head , hopelessly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in which hesays  --  " " Oh ! " Lucas cried . " Oh , wait ! His last letter  --  I Wait ! " He searched his pockets feverishly . He looked at his suitcase . He bent as if to open it . " No ! " He straightened . " No ! I know where it is ! " He grinned happily at the bursar , sharing his joy with him . " And it 's all there ! How he wants me to go to summer school , how he 's glad I 've agreed to go  --  it took a little persuading , " he confided sheepishly , " and how I 'm to come home for two days and he 'll give me the check and I 'm to have three dollars a week spending money  --  " He paused to get his breath , excited , relieved ; a great sigh of relief swelled from him . " Spending money ? " 110 " Yes , he keeps me pretty short , does n't want me to have too much . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're pretty badly spoiled , he keeps pointing them out to me  --  but that 's enough . Goodness ! I can doon that very well ! Sure ! As a matter of fact it took my last nickel for train fare  --  I ' 11 need the first week 's in advance  --  " " You go get the letter  --  " " I will ! " He grabbed his suitcase . " I 'll be right back  --  thank you ! Thank you , Mr. Johnson ! I wo n't be a minute  --  1 " He escaped from the bursar 's office . Still wearing the bright smile for all to see , he rushed out of the building , toward Saylor Hall . At a safe distance he discarded the smile . He licked his dry lips . Fear thickened inhim . He forced himself to consider the next step , to do what must be done . He went directly to his room . He unpacked , putting off the moment , holding off the fear . When his few clothes had been put away he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dormitory brooded in the stillness of summer . He had a sudden feeling that except for himself the campus was deserted . Alfred 's pennants and pictures were still on the wall . Fulboating , Lucas thought . And he remembered Alfred 's laughter , pictured him somewhere in a happy , lazy , intimate shouting group . He looked about the room again , now emptier , now more still , more alien . And now determinedly he turned to his desk , rummaged there , found a few sheets of Job 's business stationery he frugally used for correspondence . He left the room . He walked down the corridor , knocking at doors , opening them , until he found a room still occupied , an occupied room and a typewriter . He brought the typewriter back to his room . He inserted a sheet of his father 's business stationery . " Job Marsh , " it said across the top , " Harnessof all Kinds , Repairs , Try the Shawnee Line , Only the Best Meetsthe Test . Branch Offices : Meridian , Tyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this carefully . He began to write . " Dear son : " He found the letters with care and difficulty . " I 'm glad to hear you 're making out so well . " How would Job put it ? What were some of his expressions ? " Things have been looking up here steadily and business was never better . Have been thinking some of putting in a line over Sherwood way . More of that when I see you . Now in answer to your last letter  --  " Lucas paused . He thought carefully . He proceeded with confidence . The die was cast. "  --  I am glad you see things my way . I think taking the summer course is exactly what you need and as you know I have always wanted you to take it and been anxious that you see things my way . You make the necessaryarrangements and I want you to have four dollars a week for spendingmoney , I think that 's enough and as you know I do n't want you spoiled . When your term ends I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend some time with you . I have been very busy but I am most anxious to see you and see how you 've grown and talk over your plans and maybe have a little fun together , father and son . I 'm very proud of you and the marks you 've made and I do n't have to tell you I 've missed111you . Looking forward to seeing you when term ends and when I see you I 'll give you a check to cover your summer tuition and allowance , I remain , your loving Father . " He took the letter carefully from the typewriter . He found Job 's last letter . On the back of the page , back of the sprawling signature , he rubbed a pencil . With a pencil he followed the loops of his father 's signature . He took the upper sheet away . On his letter beneath were the faint marks of the traced signature . He took a pen and carefully followed the marks . He let the ink dry . With an eraser he removed all pencil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He folded it , put it in the envelope which had contained his last letter from Job , pocketed it , brought the typewriter back to the room from which he had borrowed it , and walked quickly back to the bursar 's office . " I 've got it ! " He came in waving the letter gleefully . The bursar took the letter carefully from its envelope , unfolded it , smoothed it , read it . He pursed his lips . " Yes , " he said , " yes , that will be all right . " " Grand ! " " That 's what we needed . " " For a while I thought I 'd lost it ! " Lucas closed his eyes in mock dismay . " Now , what courses did you have in mind  --  " " English , history , and German . Those three . I 'm going to try and do them so I wo n't have to do them this fall  --  " The bursar prepared his papers . " It certainly must be some job keeping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the records you have to keep  --  the problems  --  the whole university  --  " " It never ends . " The bursar nodded . " Well , here you are . " " I 'm certainly grateful to you , Mr. Johnson . I was in a real pickle  --  " " I 've arranged your classes to cover the mornings . I expect you 'll haveuses for the afternoons this fine weather  --  " He looked enviously toward the window . " Well  --  " " Uh  --  Mr. Johnson  --  " " Yes ? " " The allowance . I 'm a bit short and  --  " " Oh , yes . You wanted an advance . " " If you could  --  " " Four dollars , was n't it ? " " That 's right ! " " Sign this . " " I ca n't tell you how grateful I am , " Lucas said . " Well , these things do happen . We 'll hear from your father shortly  --  " " That 's right . Or  --  just send him a bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the summer-session rules in your Student 's Guide . " Lucas walked forth onto the campus . He looked over the empty , spreading acres . He possessed it all , now , it was all his , he had the universityalmost to himself . He walked about until the excitement subsided a little . He walked to his home , to Saylor Hall , he sat on the steps there and scanned the day , the summer , the fall. 112Everything fitted , everything was provided , the future was full , tidy , made whole . He turned his thought to face coldly that which would happen in Milletta . His father would hear of his arrival and learn of his abrupt departure . His father would have to be told what he was doing . There was no alternative . Job 's paternity was careless and he would not find his son 's absence disagreeable . But he would have to know what had happenedand he would have to agree to the expenditure Lucas had forged . A life with Job and Ouida had dowered Lucas with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was little in Job 's demeanor to reflect accurately whether he was secure or on thin ice , whether money was plentiful or scarce . But Ouida 's vigilance was unceasing , her anxietiesand her worries sharpened her perceptions , Job could seldom deceiveher , and , in time , Lucas , closely tuned to his mother , came to have the same perceptions , the same unconscious habit of observation . He knew now from a score of impressions that matters were somewhat precariouswith Job . He went upstairs to write the letter which must be written . He was calm . He wrote confidently : " Dear Dad : I was awfully sorry to have missed you , but it was just as well , because the way things have turned out I had to be back at school , anyway , if I wanted to be in time for a chance at summer session . One of the chief reasons I wanted to see you was to talk this over with you , it came up very suddenly so I had n't time to write before I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I tried to do it the way you taught me , figuring out all the pros and cons from the other fellow 's viewpoint . First of all there is the matter of expense . It wo n't cost much more to keep me here all summer than it would home , playing around and enjoyingmyself , which always takes money . And in the second place it shortensmy college time considerably so there is a big saving on that . I knew you would n't object too much to my being out of mischief all summer and I expect the way your plans are and the things you have afoot you would n't have too much time for me and would be glad to have as much of your time as possible free to maneuver in . " I 'm awfully sorry I missed you . I hope you can get up someday this summer , or maybe I can get a ride home . I 'm pretty strapped for money but I 'm trying to get by on what I have , even though you always told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You and I are alone now , and I 'd like to spare you all the burden I can . Your loving son , Lucas . " He read the letter detachedly and carefully . He put it in an envelope and addressed it . It had come out even better than he expected . By taking the problem point by point and addressing each point to Job 's viewpointthe letter now appeared unanswerable . In addition , he could probablyexpect from twenty to thirty additional dollars from Job during the summer . With his allowance this would sum slightly more than five dollars a week . But if he could find a spare-time job , if he was able to write Job that he was employed , he would be even more deeply rooted . It was impossible to find a job , but this was summer . Perhaps in summerHe thought of Dr. Aarons . He stuffed the letter to his father in his pocket and rushed to the hospital. 113 " Have you seen the bursar ? He 's a good man to help with jobs , " saidDr . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucas asked abruptly . He sat back , relieved . Where he had felt tension he now felt warmth . It had been said . " Cleaning the labs ? You mean a job ? As a job ? " " I streaked right over here to see you . It came to me  --  I remembered the time you took me through , how you said the labs always neededcleaning  --  " " My God , boy ! There 's no money for that ! Why , it 's all I can do tokeep the staff I 've got together ! " " I would n't need much money . . . " " Much money ! I can see you do n't know anything about money ! " " I 'll do all the labs . I 'll clean them so they shine . I 'll keep them spotless . The staff can get that much more work done . It 'll give you the effect of another technician . I 'll work every minute I 'm not in class . Weekends , too . Nights , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " For twelve dollars and a half a week . " " You ca n't do that . " " Why not ? " " It 's no pay for a human . An orderly gets more , a cleaning woman  --  " " That 's all I need . " " I ca n't let you do it . " " Dr. Aarons , do n't you know what it means to me , just to be allowed to work in the laboratory ? " " I know , I know . My boy , there are certain basic realities which youhave to face in life . Dreams , ideals , are one thing  --  but the world aboutyou  --  " " And your labs would be spotless . Always . Spotless . And think of theextra volume they 'd turn out  --  freed from janitor work ! Will you askthem ? Will you ? Please ? " Dr. Aarons looked away from the intense young face . If it was a dollarand a quarter a week it 'd be just the same . So it wo n't kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt is another dirt , and this dirt has the mantle of science to make it respectable . He shrugged . " It 'll be all right , " he sighed . " If I have to pay you out of my own pocket we 'll make it work , somehow . " " Dr. Aarons  --  ! " " Now , do n't thank me ! It 's criminal to work for that , I ought to beashamed to let you , I am ashamed  --  " Suffocated with happiness Lucas was helped into a white coat , he wore a white coat for the first time , now he wore part of the uniform . He nodded shyly as Dr. Aarons announced him carefully as the new lab helper . He beamed , wordless , during the pleasantries that followed , conscious of the white coat , impatient to begin . " I leave him to your tender mercies , " Dr. Aarons said at last . " He 'll be a shadow by the end of the week , " Miss Dorchester promised. 114Dr . Aarons was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came forward . " You ever work in a lab before ? " " No , I have n't  --  " " Well , I 'll show you what you 've got to do . " He turned and walked to the rear of the lab . Lucas followed . The women watched , exchanged outraged looks , shrugged and returned to their microscopes . The laboratory was a long rectangle , divided into four small rooms and one large room . In the smaller rooms the laboratory animals were caged , there were two rooms for patients and a room for supplies . The larger room was shelved with reagents and chemical equipment which occupied three-fifths of its space . The remainder , the province of Miss Jeanette and Miss Dorchester , was equipped with clinical test apparatus . Following Ahrlquist , Lucas walked in a narrow aisle on either side of which geometrical vines of glass tubing rose from squat , round , flat , cylindrical , brown , blue , clear , amber vessels , wax-stoppered , glass-stoppered , cork-stoppered , clear , cloudy , stained , colorless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boundless with function , insistent with surmise , with drama , momentous with curiosity , the extension of his living , the machinery of his vector , the instruments of his mind , the branches for his hands . " What 's the matter , " Ahrlquist asked indifferently . He had watched covertly . " It excites me . I ca n't help it . " " This ? This crap ? " " I mean the shapes of them , their complexity , what they do  --  " " Lot of goddamned glass . " " Do you think I 'll ever learn how to work that stuff ? " " Is that what he put you here for ? " " Oh , Lord , no ! Just to clean up . I meant  --  " " It 'd be like him ! " " Look ! I do n't know the simplest thing ! It 's just that the sight of this stuff excites me . Always has . " " When you 've cleaned the five millionth piece of it let me know how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Lucas said placatively . " There 's nothing to it . " " Nothing ! " Lucas looked at Ahrlquist enviously , admiringly . " You 'll get used to it . " Ahrlquist was mollified . " What do you want me to tackle first ? " " That thing there , for instance . " He flicked a tall flask , one of a glitteringrow , shaped like a pear with a long , long neck , stoppered , the stopper receiving an inverted smaller flask , in turn tubed , leading to anotherinvert , stoppered in a twin of the first flask . A row of these , precise , exactly the same , exactly aligned , all on a stand exactly machined to fitthem , beneath each flask a burner , in one end of the stand a spigot . Lucas stared at it , his mouth open . " That 's a Kjeldahl . " " A Kjeldahl ! " " Distillation. " 115Lucas swallowed . " And that 's a Van Slyke amino-nitrogen deaminizing  --  " Kjeldahl . . . Van Slyke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He jerked his head irritably in the direction of the women  --  " I wish they 'd learn to keep their goddamnedstuff in their own department ! " Kjeldahl . . . Van Slyke . . . inspissator . . . " That 's for titration , they 're too goddamned cheap to buy a Coleman  --  extraction and separatory condensers and tubes  --  Saybolts , Erlenmeyers , Hempels , Sokhlets with a Friedrichs condenser  --  junk , junk , junk  --  " By the end of the first day Lucas had learned how to clean the animal cages . He had washed flasks , he had learned to ether-dry pipettes , to wash slides , to dust bottles , to sweep floors . He had mollified Ahrlquist , he had avoided the area where the women worked , he had waited sedulously onAhrlquist . " You got some fraternity meeting to go to  --  some college-boy stuff ? " Ahrlquist asked as the day ended . " No , no ! I do n't go in for that kind of stuff ! I do n't belong to any-thing  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to eat in anyof those fancy places I eat in a lunch room . It 's good enough for me ! " " Me too ! " " Okay , then . " Ahrlquist looked sidelong at Lucas . " Ever bowl ? " heblurted suddenly . Lucas blinked . " Bowl ? " " Christ , you know what bowling is , do n't you . You been in bowling alleys ! " " Gosh  --  I have n't  --  I live in a little town , and  --  " " Well , for Christ 's sake . You do n't know anything about bowling ! " But Ahrlquist was pleased . " Do you bowl ? " Ahrlquist glanced at Lucas , twitched his lip elaborately . " Yeah . . . Some " At the diner Ahrlquist fed avidly and silently , then pushed the plateaway with disinterest . Lucas made haste to finish the sandwich which his budget allowed him . He rose , still hungry , the flat-tasting egg sandwichgave him a sense of virtue , of the better things disregarded . Ahrlquist 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowroom , a strip of torn carpet , a bed with a thin mattress and a worn , patched spread , a second-hand bureau , a chair , a rattan table . On the bureau , on the rattan table were loving cups , bowling prizes , the two surfaceswere covered with them . The walls were hung with photographs , pictures of bowling alleys , group pictures lettered in white : " Tacoma Champions , 1919 , " " Missoula League , 1920 ... " lettered Lexington and Susquehanna , St. Paul , Winnigatchee , Buffalo , Herkheim , Oneida , Harrison , Multnomah . Lettered towns heard of and unheard of , blaring faces , stern , reserved , proud , determined , diffident , and wild . Lucas whistled dutifully . " What  --  them ? The cups ? Christ ! " He flung open a door . " Got a clos-etfull " " And these  --  " moving to the wall to stare with feigned absorption at the anonymous faces  --  " these are all you ? All winning teams ? " " I could be national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent , picked up tenderly a pair of bowling shoes and , sitting on the bed , begansomberly to lace them on . " Cost me sixteen dollars , " he said briefly . " Bowling stuff 's expensive ? " " I 've got everything I need . It 's going around . It 's going from town to town , working up a reputation , meeting better and better . Until byGod one day you 're in the big leagues , you 're playing champions , you 're in the runoffs . National ! " " Those are good-looking shoes . I mean  --  " " But how the hell can you save enough on what they pay ? How the hell you going to do it ? Reminds me  --  what they paying you ? " " Well , it 's not much . But it 's not their fault . I get twelve-fifty a week . That 's all I asked for . " " Twelve-fifty a week  --  1 " Ahrlquist stopped lacing his shoe to stare at Lucas . " That 's all I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed just that  --  twelve-fifty a week  --  it 's my own fault  --  " " The sons of bitches ! It 's not their money . It 's state money . There 's endowments . They got plenty . You 'd think it was theirs ! The dirty rats ! " They walked out of the dark and musty room , down the dim stairway , out into the somehow luxurious street . " I 'll be free of them someday . And then by God ... 1 " " But you know so much ! " Lucas protested . " Do you mean you 'd actuallythrow it over  --  give it up  --  for bowling ? " " Look , kid ! Do n't let the sight of a few twisted hunks of lab glass fool you . It 's just glass , see ? And the job 's just a job . Like any other . Youlearn it , you do it , you draw your pay . Sure I know it . I ought to know it . I been doing it twelve years ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deference . Hangers-on addressed him hopefully . He took it as his due . He went to the office , the manager hurried to produce a small canvas bag , hefted it carefully over the counter . Ahrlquist opened it , pulled out hisspecial bowling ball , inspected it critically , turned away , now became almostjovial . A small group of bystanders moved diffidently toward the alley , picked what seats they could find , leaned against the railing to watch . " Gon na kill ' em tonight ? " one called out brashly . " I told my missus about that three hundred  --  I told her  --  " another began excitedly . But Ahrlquist had turned his back and was now wiping his hands with care on a towel slung from the ball-return post . " Get up ! " he ordered one of the sitters . The man rose promptly . " Sitthere , " Ahrlquist directed Lucas . Lucas sat apologetically in the seat the man had cheerfully quitted . Ahrlquist now applied chalk to his hands . He inspected them critically . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shining expanse . He returned , picked up his ball . For a moment he stood , poised , lost to all else , looking far down the alley at the triangle of ninepins . Seconds later , liquid seconds in which his motionlessness dissolved without break into smooth motion , he had moved forward , his arm swung back , his arm swung forward , the ball was spinning soundlessly down the alley , it struck the pins with a tremendous crash and the alleywas empty . Ahrlquist turned and walked back . His face was expressionless . Ababble of triumph burst from the onlookers . They had been vindicated , their day had been given meaning , their existence had been given a triumph , they lived now , victoriously , on the crest of triumph , justified andalive . Lucas stared at Ahrlquist in amazement and respect . " Get the idea ? " Ahrlquist grinned , pleased , unable to conceal hispleasure . " Boy ! " said Lucas simply . On the way home Ahrlquist turned to him suddenly . " I 'm gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Split-tails ? " " The dames . The stupid dikes we got . " " What 'll I do ? I 've got to answer them  --  I 've got to be there  --  I 've gotto do what they ask me to  --  what 's the matter with them , anyway ? " " I 'm just warning you , lay off . You 're either with me or with them . " They walked a while in silence . Ahrlquist cried out suddenly : " Art , that 's what they love , pictures and music and beautiful crap like that . That 's what they talk about . To hear them pretend  --  they could go on for hours if they think you 're listening  --  and as to that awful thing ! Oh , my God . Oh , touchmenot . Ohwhatareyouthinking ! " " Did you  --  ah  --  did you  --  try  --  ? " " I took out the young one , spent two good dollars feeding her . Thenshe pretended she did n't know what I wanted . All surprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ! I should have smacked herright in the puss . " Lucas looked at him expectantly . " I told her off . I told her just what I thought of her , her and any othersplit-tail like her . She knew what I meant , all right . Next morning I told them right then and there , I said , You do your work and I 'll do mine , ' I said . ' I do n't want anything to do with any goddamned split-tail trash . ' That 's what I told them . So now they let me alone . Two dollars , feeding her goddamned face , filet mignon she ordered ! For nothing ! And sheknew it all the time . " Lucas shook his head commiseratingly . " You know something ? I 've got an idea they 're women lovers ! Lookhow they stick together , like man and wife ! For two dollars I could have had any nurse in the hospital ! Give me a nurse , every time . Give me a girl that knows the score . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a nurse is the best lay you can get . Nurses first , thenschoolteachers . " " Do n't they get fired , I mean they have to be in by midnight  --  " " How long do you think it takes to get a piece ? Say , you 're not avirgin , are you ? " " Me ? Heck , no ! I just did n't know about nurses  --  " 118 " Fired , hell ! They got to catch them first . Wait until you 're an intern . You 'll see . Hell , they stand ' em up in linen closets , empty rooms , diet kitchens , just whip up their skirts and pour it to them . Those interns get the best . And you know why ? Look at the life those nurses lead ! Up at five o'clock , mucking in bedpans all day and then what ? Squat together reading last month 's magazines they stole from some patient . You ever see the food they eat ? Just give one of them the chance at a steak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready . Boy , you 're goingto have your eyes opened ! " " I sure did n't know that ! " " What else have they got in life ? The only other thing is somedaymaybe they can marry a doctor . That 's what they 're all out for . " " She could help him  --  " " What does he get he could n't get free ? So he marries her and gets a free nurse and maybe she 's got a couple of hundred dollars saved . And all he 'd have to do is wait a little and marry a rich girl ! Maybe find one that comes to him in trouble . Lots of doctors do that ! Plenty ! " He grinned suddenly . " Do n't be surprised if I 'm a little late tomorrow . If they can afford to hire a helper they can afford to give me a raise . " Next morning Lucas was at work when the two women arrived . " Here so early ? " Miss Dorchester 's brows lifted . " Where 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I think he had something he wanted to see the hospital about , " Lucassaid lamely . " Well , that 's something , " Miss Jeanette said , relieved . She carried a paper box . She walked with it to one of the metal-topped tables and frombehind a row of tall bottles she brought forth a box of tea , a can of evaporatedmilk , and a small box of sugar . Miss Jeanette , who had rinsed and filled a flask , set it on a ring and lit a Bunsen burner . " So you 've been out with the Ahrlquist . Now , you know all about us ! " " Leave him alone , Ann . " " We 've heard about his stories , " Miss Jeanette said grimly . " Do you think you 'll like laboratory work ? " Miss Dorchester asked . " Oh , yes ! " He looked about the room . " Yes ! Yes , I  --  " " He 's got that look in his eye , Ann ! " Miss Dorchester cried . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one to the other . " I 'm sorry ! " Miss Dorchester apologized . " Dr. Aarons told us .

" He filled you up about us , did n't he ? What did he say ? " " He ca n't eat and talk too , " Miss Dorchester protested . " He did n't say much , Miss Jeanette , " Lucas began miserably . " You ca n't help but be sorry for him , " Ruth said . " I 'd as soon feel sorry for a snake ! " Ann snorted . Ruth smiled **25;8332;TOOLONG side with the Williamses . Had it not been for that , joined to the circumstance that the Williamses went back in an unbroken line to one of " The Twenty Families , " she might have foundered at the start . Anson sometimes wondered if she knew how close she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The threat still lurked in her father 's money  --  not millions , which by their own crushing weight might have commanded that awe which passes for respect , nor even so much as a half million . With the Williams connection , Pompey 's Head would have been willing to accept a half million . There would have been a substantial tidiness to the sum , impressive but not intimidating , a sign of inherited money judiciously invested . But there was neither the crush of millions , the discreetness of a half million , nor , finally , what the inner circle was best qualified to understand : " People in modest circumstances ; just enough to get along on . " As a consequence , the proper placement of the newcomers was puzzling in the extreme ; they were not rich , they were not " family , " they were not poor , they were not " Irish Channel . " The only thing to do , obviously , was to wait and see  --  meanwhile , because of Ellen Williams , Joe Ann 's mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchful waiting lasted for nearly a year . Then it became known that Mr. Robbins , an upcountry Georgian who had acquired the controlling interest in a fertilizer factory on the edge of town , had purchased the old Wedderburn house on St. Andrew 's Square . To that , in itself , the inner circle would have had no serious objection ; it was granted that he had a right to be ambitious for his only child . It was what came after  --  the carpenters , the plasterers , the painters , the electricians ; the Negroes spading in the gardens and the other Negroes unloading antiques ; the elaborate act of restoration that turned the old house into one of the show places that the tourists went out of their way to see . But only the tourists . The tight , hard core of the inner circle , taking one look , decided to look the other way . It was done too expensively and too soon . But then , as was said across the bridge tables of the Wednesday Afternoon Ladies Society and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expect ? It was new money , was n't it , and did n't such money always want to splash around ? And by tomorrow , if not before , they would be talking about the champagne  --  Anson could already hear them . But if it were Pettibone champagne , McCloud champagne , Paxton champagne , nothing4  --  would be said ; Anson could feel his resentment rising . All because Kit did n't have ancestors . It sounded silly when said aloud , but it was nonetheless true . Kit 's being the prettiest girl her age was not enough . Truly to dazzle , her radiance had to be looked down upon by portraitsfrom the wall . Joe Ann Williams could afford to jest , that bright , cheerful , happy-go-lucky girl  --  it became part of her legend of laughter when she said , " We 're just like the Japanese . All we do is worship our ancestors and eat rice . " And it was granted to little Dinah Blackford , Wyeth 's thirteen-year-old sister , also to question the incense and the altars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she demanded of a gathering of the immediate clan around the dinner table one Sunday afternoon , and then , in the midst of the astonished pause , " I think they 're dull ! " So Joe Ann and so Dinah . But not Kit . She had only that distant cousinship to sustain her ; no matter how close she came to the inner circle , she could not step within that final , guarded ring  --  unless she married into it , of course . Anson knew this as well as she . And sometimes wondered . This was one of the times when he wished that being in love with Kit were not so difficult . He envied Wyeth Blackford his easy relation with Joe Ann . Wyeth never had to give two seconds ' thought to anything . But he , Anson  --  well , take this champagne . Why did he have to have it added to all his other worries ; why must he be troubled with the awareness of the hurt it might do to Kit ; why could n't it just be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too many things to think about . Sorry though he was that Kit could not invite him to breakfast , he was glad he was going out shooting with Wyeth . He could forget nearly everything once he was in a blind . In later years , looking back upon that winter , Anson realized that it was Kit Robbins who caused him to subject his environment to critical examination for the first time . As part of the examination , he had to consider his own position in Pompey 's Head . He had always known that he had no ancestors , not in the Pompey 's Head sense of the word , and the lack had never mattered . His mother 's people , the Lawrences , had been established in the small towns and villages of the western part of the state for well over a hundred and fifty years . They had contributed their share of doctors , lawyers , farmers , and merchants to the general welfare , even a minister or two , and while none of them had ever spread his name or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it was worth , that41he stemmed from the Lawrences of Ockeelaka County . He also knew , more positively , that his father 's father was David Page . This dimly remembered progenitor could never be regarded as a proper Pompey 's Head ancestor , having come South from New Hampshire at a time when all Northern men were lumped together as carpetbaggers , and his portrait would never be hung on the walls of the Pompey 's Head Historical Museum . He planned no battles , pioneered no wilderness , introduced no crops to the colonial economy . However , you could find his likeness and read the story of his life in The History of Pompey 's Head . Contained in two volumes , it was written by J. Fletcher Pearce , who was also the author of Chronicles of Marlborough County ; Genealogical History of the Twenty Founding Families , which most people thought was a most distinguished work . The " History " was published in 1896 . Its full title was The History of Pompey 's Head , From the Earliest Periods to the Present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes occupied a prominent place on the Page bookshelves , as they did on the bookshelves of many other families , and as a boy Anson had often taken them down . His grandfather 's likeness , a steel engraving , was in the section devoted to Trade , Commerce , and Manufactures . It showed him in a frock coat with wide lapels , wearing a pearl stickpin in his stock . His hair was white , his jaw was set , and his eyes looked straight from the page  --  you sensed a commanding , almost intimidating presence that was hard to reconcile with the fading recollection of the tall , kindly man who smelled of tobacco , took you boating on the river , and gave you shiny ten-cent pieces . Anson had read the passage concerning his grandfather so many times that he could recite it word for word . David Page , one of the leading merchants and civic leaders of Pompey 's Head , was born June 9 , 1852 , near Durham , New Hampshire , where his father was engaged in agriculture . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's farm until 1868 when , desiring to better his condition , he removed to Portsmouth . Finding gainful occupation in that commercial and maritime center , he remained there until 1870 , when , having married the former Miss Mary Deye , the only daughter of a pious and respectable Portsmouth family , he determined to seek his fortune farther afield . Mr. Page came to Pompey 's Head in 1871 , separating himself42from his bride until he had opportunity to establish himself . He had not yet reached his twentieth birthday and had but six dollars and fifteen cents in his pocket when he arrived . He is emphatically a " self-made man , " whose success has been won by steadfastness of purpose , honorable dealing , untiring industry , and loyalty to the city of his adoption that has all but erased the accidental circumstance of his Northern birth . Beneath an exterior which a casual observer might deem unsympathetic is a warm , generous , and cordial nature . His sympathies are manifested by deeds rather than words , and he gives freely to every deserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anson liked best : A few days after arriving in Pompey 's Head , young Page , without friends or acquaintances , went to the mercantile establishmentof Murdoch &; Brown , and requested an interview with Mr. Brown , who consented to see him . He explained his financial condition to Brown , showed what remained of his six dollars and fifteen cents , and asked for a little credit . Brown scrutinized his visitor , and , remarking that he seemed like " a nice , honest , upright young Yankee , " granted the request . Young Page left Murdoch &; Brown with a job lot of whips that he peddled about town . Within a week he returned and paid the little indebtedness , a matter of but two or three dollars . He asked for a larger supply of merchandise on credit , which Brown granted , and from these transactions there resulted a friendship that lasted until Mr. Brown 's death . Mr. Page has never hesitated to say that he regards him as his greatest single benefactor . Then came the part about young Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Having saved enough money to buy a horse and wagon , young Page 's next venture was to purchase a large stock of New Orleans coffee , which he sold to the residents of Mercier 's Bend , now incorporatedwithin the city limits of Pompey 's Head and generally known as the Irish Channel , and other areas far from retail stores . In this and other enterprises he also succeeded , and soon realized a sum sufficient to justify the thought of engaging regularly in business . He embarked in the retail hardware trade , and prosperedto such an extent that he ventured to open a more preten-43tious business in what was then known as " The Green Store , " on Bullis Street near the Municipal Market . And then the conclusion : Mr. Page has always exhibited a warm affection for the city of his adoption , and it would be hard to select any one of her businessmen who has taken a deeper interest in every judicious scheme to advance her prosperity . One of the original investors in the Pompey 's Head Spinning Company ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also identified , along with his close friend , Colonel Robert Blackford , with the reorganizationof the Atlantic &; Central Railroad . For eleven years he has been a director in the Merchants &; Mechanics Bank , in whose prosperity he has taken great pride . Mr. Page is still in the vigor and prime of manhood , and his constant success from youth to the present time constitutes a cogent argument in favor of earnest endeavor as the pathway to high and honorable station . It was apparent , then , even through the pages of a paid biography , that David Page , the New Hampshire Yankee who moved South , was a grandfather worth having  --  you bore his name , you walked in his memory , and you knew who you were . There were certain things beyond your reach , such as future membership in the Pompey 's Head Light Infantry Club , which was limited to those whose ancestors had fought in the ranks of the regiment during the Revolution , and you were aware , also , that there was considerably less money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said so directly , or even hinted at , but you gathered that your father was not the " businessman " your grandfather had been  --  less ambitious ; not so far-seeing ; interested in books without being a scholar ; content simply to run the hardware store which had been moved to the center of town on Bay Street . You suspected that there had been hurts in the past , knowing enough about your environment to imagine some of the things that must have been said about young David Page , but the hurts were not yours . Others had borne them for you , and in the bearing secured your place . It never occurred to you to question anything , so firm was the knowledge of who you were , and then , suddenly , you met a girl . You saw things differently . You examined yourself and your place more critically . And years later , 44riding through the streets of New York with a man named Charles Barlowe , you could remember exactly how it was . You could still see the girls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain drummed on the roof of the taxi , you could almost hear the music . The band was playing " Sweet Sue . " 45CHAPTER FOURA thoughtful pause on the part of Mr. Barlowe caused Anson to stop thinking about Pompey 's Head . It was all right to let your attentionwander during one of Mr. Barlowe 's monologues , provided you were ready to return the ball if he should decide to send it into your court . Now , having followed that fellow in Speed 's bank to the end of his unhappy career , and again reaching the conclusion that character in a man was like conformation in a horse , he was ready to bring the discussion another step forward . " This Mrs. Wales , " he said . " What 's her story ? " It was now Anson 's turn to be thoughtful . " So far as I know , it 's not much of a story . Her family has always been a prominent one down in my part of the country and  --  " " We 've covered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't know much else . Mrs. Wales was on the stage for a time --  " " You do n't say . " The tone of Mr. Barlowe 's voice , however , did say ; it said , " Ah ha  --  so that 's the way it is ! " Mr. Barlowe belonged to a generation that had not been able completely to down the feeling that being on the stage was one of the more intriguing forms of immorality . He looked as though he felt that he had hit upon a significant clue . " A chorus girl ? " he asked . It was easy to see what Mr. Barlowe had in mind  --  one of the editionsof the Follies ; a glitter of rhinestones in the beam of a spotlight ; a powdered procession of long-legged young women descending a flight of stairs in handsome , shapely undress . " No sir , " Anson said , " Mrs. Wales was n't a chorus girl . She was a46dramatic actress . She wanted to be one , that is . Her marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minor roles in Caesar 's Wife . " " I saw that , " Mr. Barlowe interjected with sudden interest . " Billie Burke was in it . An attractive woman , too . You say that Mrs. Wales was in that play ? " " Not very noticeably , I 'm afraid . I did n't see it and all I know about it  --  " " Of course you did n't see it . That was before your time . I do n't suppose you saw Lightnin ' either . " " No sir , I did n't . " " And William Gillette in Dear Brutus ? And E. H. Sothern and Julia Marlowe in Twelfth Night ? " " No , but my father --  " Mr. Barlowe looked subdued . " The theater was worth going to in those days . You could count on a good evening 's entertainment . But now  --  one of the girls dragged me to something the other night that I was ashamed to sit through . I may not be able to appreciate such things , as the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of the theater as it was in my day , Forbes-Robertson and Maude Adams and The Chocolate Soldier and Laurette Taylor in Peg 0 ' My Heart  --  " He shrugged his shoulders and shook off his subdued look . " So Mrs. Wales was an actress , you say ? " " Only in that she appeared in that one play , " Anson replied . " It was hardly more than a walk-on part , with only a few lines . Phillip Greene told me that she received excellent notices . It was n't so much her talent as her appearance . She was called the most beautiful young actress on Broadway . " Mr. Barlowe meditated for an instant and then shook his head . " I 've been trying to remember her but I ca n't . I distinctly recall Billie Burke , though . I remember discussing her with Mrs. Barlowe after the theater . I said she looked like a horsewoman  --  it was her carriage that made me think so  --  and Mrs. Barlowe did n't agree with me . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember this Mrs. Wales for the life of me . Are you sure she was in that play ? " " She married Wales during its run , " Anson explained . " That was just after the First World War . The marriage took place in the Little Church around the Corner . It was one of the big romances of the time . The papers were full of it . Phillip Greene was best man . " Mr. Barlowe was silent for a time . There was a new , sudden burst of rain , driving against the windows of the taxi . The weatherman47Meg had heard over the radio was wrong again , Anson thought . If he knew anything about rain , this was going to be an all-day affair . " Anson . " " Yes sir ? " " Let 's go back to Phillip Greene . Do you know any reason why Mrs. Wales might want to make it difficult for him ? " " No , I do n't . Besides , if she has any such reason , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it do her now that he 's dead ? " Mr. Barlowe nodded gravely . " That 's what has been puzzling me  --  that 's why I say we have to approach this with open minds . The fact is that this is a deliberate charge she has made . And it seems to me that you 're forgetting something important . Our client in this case is not Phillip Greene . It 's Duncan &; Company . Our only interest in Greene  --  our only legal interest , that is  --  lies in his being one of our client 's agents . And at the moment he stands accused of a serious crime by a woman who , so far as we know , has nothing to gain by defaming his memory . My suspicion is that she must have proof  --  something that she regards as proof , anyway . It is inconceivable that she would have made such a charge otherwise . " Anson wished that he could think more clearly . So convinced was he of Phillip Greene 's innocence that he had not once entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to confrontit . As Mr. Barlowe said , it was inconceivable that Mrs. Wales would have made so serious a charge unless she was in possession of something she regarded as proof . Turning to Mr. Barlowe , he said : " The way you put it , I have to agree . But how do we know what Mrs. Wales would regard as proof ? It could be some bookkeeping error . If what they say about her at Duncan &; Company is true  --  " " You mean her  --  her troublesomeness ? " Mr. Barlowe shook his head . " Maybe you 're right , but it does n't make sense . Not to me it does n't . But then , of course , I do n't know anything about these artistic people . They 're not my stripe . I 'm glad this is going to be your problem and not mine . " " You mean you want me to handle everything ? " " Everything . " Mr. Barlowe nodded slowly . " You know what makes these people tick  --  I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said as much over the telephone . After this meeting I 'm going to drop out of it . I came along just as window dressing . What 's the matter ? You look worried . " " I was just wondering what this will do to my schedule , " Anson said . " I 'm pretty clear at the moment , but there 's that London thing48you asked me to look into , and the Maddox will is coming up for probate next week --  " " Relax , " Mr. Barlowe said . " Do n't let it worry you . We 'll get one of the other boys to take over some of your load if we have to . And I naturally hope you 're right about Phillip Greene . I never knew you felt so strongly about him . " Mr. Barlowe spoke in a benign , generous fashion , almost as if he were overlooking a transgression . Mr. Barlowe did not quite approve of strong feelings of any kind , except where horses were involved . Anson was glad that once the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . He did not want the guardianshipof Phillip Greene 's reputation to fall into Mr. Barlowe 's hands. 49CHAPTER FIVEDuring daylight hours , whenever Anson happened to find himself in midtown Manhattan , he always felt out of place . The atmosphere of luxury that enveloped that part of the city made the more accustomed neighborhood of Wall Street and lower Broadway seem practically Spartan by contrast . No matter how serious the business that brought him there , he invariably felt like a tourist on a spree . Even the office buildings had an air of wealth and magnificence that caused the whole downtown district to appear prosaic and routine . Not only this , but some of them , such as the modernistic structure on Madison Avenue to which Duncan &; Company had transferred its offices a few months before , would have been unthinkable anywhere in the financial area . Anson thought it was a handsome building , rising in a series of terracedsetbacks that seemed to be made entirely of glass , but he could understand why Mr. Barlowe , who was seeing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Barlowe was expressing the downtown point of view . The building was too dramatic and unconventional . Nobody would have risked having it as an address . Mr. Barlowe , bendingforward , crooked his neck in order to get a better view from the window of the cab . Like Anson , he did not get to this part of the city often enough to take its wonders for granted . He restored himself to a sitting position and gave a derogatory grunt . " I 'd just as soon do business in the shower , " he said . " I would n't have my offices in a thing like that if they gave them to me rent-free . " Anson did not have to be told . He was fully acquainted with Mr. Barlowe 's views about offices  --  let him have his way and they would all resemble the Victorian domain of Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul . Mr. Barlowe was proud of his quarters . He felt that their solid , 50old-fashioned appearance went with the solid , old-fashioned dignity of the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an admission that Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul was in competition with what he called those fancy boys uptown . He was not impressed by the building , and he was determined not to be impressed by the new offices of Duncan &; Company . One glimpse of them as he stepped into the reception room , and his face took on a set expression that made Anson think of a senior warden being taken on a tour of a Paris bordello . He quickly observed his surroundings  --  a dimly lit , heavily carpeted room with deep leather armchairs and lines of bookshelves and a low , glass-topped table on which were spread all the firm 's latest books  --  and marched toward a striking brunette who sat at the semicircular reception desk . She was so poised and decorative that Anson wondered if she had been hired through one of the model agencies . Mr. Barlowe did not seem even to see her . " Charles Barlowe to see John Duncan , " he said abruptly . " Yes sir , " the girl said . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number on the inter-office telephone while Mr. Barlowe , still wearing his set expression , took deliberate note of the room ; he seemed to be saying that although he had no intention of letting himself get contaminated he might just as well find out what it was all about now that he was here . The girl at the reception desk spoke softly into the telephone and almost immediately John Duncan'ssecretary appeared . She was a blond , businesslike young woman in a tweed suit and a pair of sensible shoes , whom Anson knew as Miss Dodge . Inclining her head to Mr. Barlowe , she gave Anson a friendly smile . " This way , gentlemen , " she said , " Mr. Duncan is expectingyou . " She looked nothing like Mrs. Waggoner , Mr. Barlowe 's secretary , and Anson wondered what it was about her that brought Mrs. Waggoner to mind . It was the expression on her face , he finally decided . She and Mrs. Waggoner both shared the same repressed look of crisis . It was another storm signal , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was following Miss Dodge through a door that led to the maze of inner offices that were given over to the editorial activities of Duncan &; Company , he felt a throb of excitement . It would n't do to let it show , however , and he made his face as expressionless as he could . The conference was held in the board of directors ' room . Looking out upon the roofs and towers of uptown Madison Avenue , it was a large , rectangular chamber with pine paneling and a heavy green51carpet . The canyon of Fifty-seventh Street cut its way crosstown a few blocks away . Several English sporting prints from John Duncan 's private collection hung on the walls of the room , along with a portrait of old Mr. Duncan in a heavy gold frame , and there was a long , highly polished table made of one of the light-colored woods that had come into fashion , and a set of chairs to match . John Duncan sat at the head of the table and Mr. Barlowe sat at his right . Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of papers in front of him , was Paul Tarbell , a compact , square-built man in his late fifties who was one of Duncan &; Company 's old hands . Starting out as a salesman , he now held the title of executive vicepresidentand treasurer . Anson sat opposite him . Next to Anson , also with a folder , was Van Buren Bliss , the firm 's editor-in-chief since the death of Phillip Greene . Bliss and Greene had entered the firm a few months apart ; they had been close friends . A big man , Bliss showed the increasing heaviness of middle age . His pepper-and-salt hair was parted on the side , standing up slightly , and his jaws were clamped on a short , stubby pipe . He looked more like a retired militaryman than an editor , but Phillip Greene had not looked like an editor either  --  Phillip Greene most closely resembled a Vermont schoolmaster come to the city in his one good suit . Bliss puffed on his pipe , found that it had gone out , and reached for one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turning to Anson , he said : " This is some rain we 're having . If it does n't stop soon , my block on Eighty-first Street is going to be flooded again . " " A lot you have to worry about , " Paul Tarbell said from across the table . " You should see that river that runs past my place in Connecticut . Two more feet and I 'm going to have it flowing through my cellar . " " Two more feet means a lot of water , " Anson put in . " It wo n't rise that much , will it ? " " If this weather keeps up it will , " Tarbell replied . " For the past two months we 've had nothing but rain  --  hardly any snow at all . That 's why the river is so high . All that water has no place to go . " " I 've never liked river property , " Mr. Barlowe interjected . " You can go on for ten or fifteen years , thinking you 're safe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under six feet of water . Shore property is just as bad . Along comes one of these hurricanes we 've been having and all you 're left with is a pile of matchwood . " It was like a ritual , Anson thought . Here they were confronted by52a problem of such grave importance that it demanded a special meetingwhich was going to make everybody late for lunch , and yet it was required of them , as if by the rules of some secret society , that they first talk about something else . Not that they imagined the problem would disappear in the meantime , or that it was not occupyingthe whole forefront of their attentions , or that they were trying to screw up courage enough to deal with it . It was simply a kind of ceremony , reflecting an ingrained set of attitudes . ' Weather and rivers led to fishing , and fishing led to fishing trips , and now John Duncan was telling about the summer he packed into the Big Horn Mountains of Wyoming . Van Buren Bliss looked interested and Mr. Barlowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules and procedures of the society , and from the trace of restlessness that both Mr. Barlowe and Paul Tarbell were beginning to show , Anson surmised that John Duncan was getting close to the edge . His tone and his remarks were no longer cursory ; he was genuinely interested in what he was saying ; he seemed to be forgetting that there was work to be done . Mr. Barlowe made a bold show of looking at his wrist watch . The rules of the society precluded Paul Tarbell 's doing this , or Van Buren Bliss , and it would have been unimaginable on the part of Anson . But Mr. Barlowe was a senior member in excellent standing . It was quite in order for him to suggest to another member that his conversation was getting beyond the prescribed latitudes . John Duncan accepted the correction in good grace . " I suppose we 'd better go to work , " he said , looking around the table . " The sooner we get this over with , the better . We all know what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If we could go on from there --  " He was trying to make it easy for himself , Anson realized . It was significant that he had avoided all mention of Phillip Greene . This incredible thing had happened , this bolt had come crashing down , and although he must know that Greene 's name had inevitably to be brought into the discussion , he had plainly shied away from it . Mr. Barlowe , however , was not handicapped by such compulsive behavior . Frowning ever so slightly , he said : " Let 's take our time , John . I 'm afraid I do n't have as much of the background as you fellows . As I understand it , from what you said over the telephone --  " " You know damn well what I said over the telephone , " John Duncanburst out in a fit of impatience . " I said that Phil Greene has been53accused by Lucy Wales of embezzling twenty thousand dollars of Garvin 's royalties . What the hell else is there ? " Mr. Barlowe maintained his look of self-confident calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking that it was up to him to keep the meeting in hand . Managing an indulgent smile , as if to indicate that he knew all about his old friend 's short temper and profane speech , which were really quite attractive in their way , Mr. Barlowe said , " A lot else , John . This accusation , for instance ? How was it made ? In writing ? " " Of course it was made in writing ! Do you think that woman called me up on the telephone ? She has n't spoken a word to me in nearly ten years . " " Why ? " ? " Because she 's a bitch , that 's why ! A mean , poisonous , troublemakingbitch ! " Mr. Barlowe 's blandness dropped for an instant , leaving his face startled and exposed . He was not used to such uncontrolled outcries . Paul Tarbell , sitting next to him , appeared only slightly less uncomfortable . Close though he had been to the chaotic world of books and authors for the larger part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his natural element once he left his niche in what he liked to describeas the hardheaded , practical end of the business . He seemed to Anson to be snuggling closer to Mr. Barlowe for protection . Adjustinghis features , Mr. Barlowe said : " What you say , John , may be true and it may also be relevant . That 's what I 'm trying to find out . Right now , though , I 'd like to get a few more facts . From what you say , I take it that there was a letter from Mrs. Wales . Is that correct ? " " That 's right . " Paul Tarbell nodded and drew an envelope from the folder before him . " It came in the morning mail . " Handing the envelopeto Mr. Barlowe , he added , " You will notice that it 's addressed to Van . He brought it in to John , and John brought it in to me  --  it was quite a bombshell , as you can imagine . " Studying the envelope , Mr. Barlowe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else I 'd like to ask , " he continued , lifting his eyes and looking about the table . " Is there any significance in the fact that the letter was addressed to Mr. Bliss ? Purely as an outsider , coming in cold , I 'd say that it seems curious that a communication such as this would n't be addressed to John . You understand , of course , that I 'm just trying to get the background . " " The reason that letter was n't sent to me , " John Duncan said , 54 " is because  --  Oh , you tell him , Van ! But make it short . Let 's get this wagon to roll . " Van Buren Bliss eased his heavy frame into a more comfortable position and took the pipe from his mouth . " It 's like this , Mr. Barlowe  --  I'mthe only one here that Mrs. Wales will write to . Not that we are on very good terms . The truth is that we are n't . But she has to write to somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see . " Mr. Barlowe touched the tips of his fingers together and looked across the manicured steeple they made . " And Mrs. Wales , as I understand it from Anson , is not above making things difficult . What I mean is that , given two interpretations , a good and a bad , she would most likely , so far as your own experience is concerned , be inclined to choose the bad . Is that correct ? " " Yes sir , " Bliss said . " You put it too mildly , but that 's correct . " Anson was compelled to admire Mr. Barlowe . He seemed to be proceeding in a dull , ponderous manner , and all the while he was not proceeding at all . Deliberately . John Duncan 's harsh words had set him back for a moment , but he was intelligent enough to recognizethem for what they were  --  a flash of jagged lightning in a sullen , inflamed sky . What he was now doing , along with taking his place on the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one around the table was aware of it , was cooling off the atmosphere . Anson sat watching John Duncan as Mr. Barlowe asked further questions about Mrs. Wales . Since he knew that part of the story , he could afford to let his mind wander a bit . John Duncan had aged greatly since that morning in the duck blind . His grizzled sparseness had given way to a gray , almost cadaverous thinness that had drawn his cheeks into hollows and left his eyes sunk far back in their sockets . He was getting into his late sixties and looked worn and tired . Anson again remembered those hours in the duck blind , and for an instant he found it curious that he should be sitting as an equal in the same room with John Duncan , one of his associates and one of his friends . There had been almost as many ring-necks as there were mallards in the flocks that morning , and he had said to John Duncan , " I do n't think you 're leading them enough , sir , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Duncan had a nervous way of jerking at the trigger , which spoiled every shot , he was now sitting in a board of directors ' room in New York City with his life gone off in a direction that he would never have dreamed possible at the time . He had not gone shooting with Wyeth Blackford following Kit55Robbins 's party after all . Wyeth was seized upon by Mr. Stewart , the new member who had given him the bottle of scotch , and he , Anson , had gone out with John Duncan . He rowed him out to the blind while it was still dark , with most of the stars still shining and only the creak of the oarlocks in the lonely silence he loved so much , that and the lapping of the water against the sides of the skiff , and just before daylight he set out the decoys . The flocks started flying early , just as Wyeth had predicted , and from all across the marsh there came the firing of the guns . John Duncan had the best shooting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made one difficult shot  --  bringing down a mallard that was dropping to the decoys with its wings set to brake and then , already climbing , veered off sharply to the left  --  and so had something to boast about that night around the fire in the lounge . He put the day 's success down to the instruction he had from Anson , and when Anson sought him out to tell him good-by he pressed his hand warmly and said , " Young fellow , if ever you come to New York and I can do anything to help you , I want you to let me know . " Anson thanked him , never thinking the time would come , and now , sitting in the same room with John Duncanon this rainy March day , it was still hard to realize that it was he who had sent him downtown to see Mr. Barlowe about a job . Looking at Mr. Barlowe , Anson saw that he had taken Mrs. Wales 's letter from its envelope and was reading it intently . " Well ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lady does n't mince words , does she ? Unless she receives immediate settlement she will turn the matter over to her attorneys without further notice . " He lowered the letter and surveyed the faces at the table . " I now understand what you mean about her troublesomeness . Not a word about the possibility of error . Simply the flat , direct charge , and that she has her husband 's consent to turn the matter over to her repre-sentative . " " That 's what I ca n't understand , " John Duncan said , " Garvin 's going along with her . Except that I do n't believe it  --  it 's one of that woman 's lies , I 'm sure ! " Mr. Barlowe pursed his lips thoughtfully . " You may be right , John , and I hope you are . I think , however , that we ought to understand the legal technicalities . If any action is taken , it would have to be done by Wales  --  even with his wife 's having his power of attorney she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to be brought by him , in his own name . He would have to give his consent , in56other words . And apparently , on the face of this letter , he already has . " " I still do n't believe it ! " John Duncan said doggedly . " Garvin would n't do a thing like this to Phil . It 's more of that woman 's troublemaking , I tell you ! I know it is ! " Mr. Barlowe nodded in a consoling fashion . " If that 's the case , we 'll find it out in time . For the moment , though , I suggest we take the lady at her word  --  as matters stand , we are obliged to . But what about these dates and sums she gives ? Have you been able to check them ? " " Yes , we have , " John Duncan said . " Paul and Van spent the morning going through our files . They show that Phil had twenty thousand dollars of Garvin 's royalties transferred to his own account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , damn it , they make it look bad for Phil . " Anson listened with a sinking sensation . This was a scene he had not visualized . He had argued with Mr. Barlowe about how impossible it was , just as impossible as his going out and shooting his favorite mare , and already it appeared as though he might be wrong . He looked from John Duncan to Paul Tarbell and then to Van Buren Bliss ; there was nothing in their expressions calculated to raise his spirits . They repeated what John Duncan had just said  --  it looked bad for Phil . He felt something close to gratitude for Mr. Barlowe 's unruffled calm . " Let 's get the facts first , " Mr. Barlowe said . " Nothing is gained by jumping to conclusions . These dates and sums that Mrs. Wales gives in her letter  --  I notice they go back a number of years . " " All the way to September 6 , 1919 , " Paul Tarbell said . " That 's the first one . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper on which he had made some notes . " The last one was June 12 , 1940 . There was a withdrawal on that date of one thousand dollars . Wales 's royalty reports indicatethat it was transferred from his account to Phil 's . Each withdrawalwas made the same way . We 've found all Phil 's memos to the accounting department . They show that he ordered the checks to be made out in his name . " " And you say that you have been able to check your own records as far back as 1919 ? " Mr. Barlowe asked . " We could check them back to the first year of the firm if we57wanted to , " Paul Tarbell replied with just a trace of pride . " Consideringthe authors we 've published , our files are worth having . There is more than one university that would like to get its hands on them . Besides , in publishing you never know when the smallest scrap of paper  --  " " That 's true of any business , " Mr. Barlowe interrupted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decisive factor was a receipted bill made out in 1898 . It definitely established proof of purchase of certain disputed pieces of jewelry by a grandfather of my client . The ownership of the pieces was disputed by a half cousin who claimed that the pieces in question had been purchased after my client 's grandfather 's second marriage . You may remember the incident . It came up in connection with the settlement of the Dodd estate . " Anson was afraid they were in for one of Mr. Barlowe 's stories , takingforever , but Mr. Barlowe brought himself back to the contents of Mrs. Wales 's letter . " The period covered by these withdrawals is how many years altogether ? " he asked . " Twenty-one , " Van Buren Bliss replied . " But it seems to me  --  it seems to all of us  --  that those figures --  " He cut himself short . " Excuse me , Paul , I did n't mean to interrupt . " " That 's all right , " Paul Tarbell said . " This is n't my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Van Buren Bliss stared at the table for an instant , rubbing the bowl of his pipe with his thumb . Raising his eyes , he said : " The feeling we have , Mr. Barlowe , John and Paul and I , is that these figures ca n't be relied upon exclusively . We all admit that they make out a damaging case against Phil . According to them , Phil was having these sums of money withdrawn from Garvin 's account and transferred to his own for twenty-one years . Mrs. Wales seems to have us dead to right , but personally , knowing Phil  --  " " It 's been definitely established then , " Mr. Barlowe broke in , " that the figures given by Mrs. Wales are correct . I want to get that straight . You have eliminated all possibility of any error in bookkeeping ? " " There 's been no error , " Paul Tarbell said . " We 've checked and rechecked . It 's easy to see what happened . Mrs. Wales copied those figures from the royalty reports we sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  several carbons , as a matter of fact  --  and all her figures tally with ours . But I agree with Van  --  there must be something behind those figures . " " You 're damned right there is ! " John Duncan spread his hands58and put them down hard on the table . " It would n't take Phil five minutes to tell us what this is all about , but Phil is n't here . All we have is that woman 's letter and our books . I do n't care what the figures show ! If Phil was drawing money from Garvin 's account and having it transferred to his own , well , I say that Garvin knew about it , by God ! How in the name of the Seven Tribes could he not know ? All those withdrawals appeared on his royalty reports , did n't they ? Blind as he is today , he has n't been blind for twenty-one years ! I say to hell with those figures ! If that woman thinks she has me over a barrel and wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , " Paul Tarbell said in an agitated tone . " That 's one of the things that we agreed upon  --  that she must n't see a lawyer , I mean . I naturally go along with you and Van , of course , but , as you yourself said , if she goes to a lawyer and makes a noise about this , getting it into the newspapers --  " Anson could see why it should not get into the newspapers . The headlines would say that America 's leading novelist was threatening to sue his publishers for twenty thousand dollars that had been embezzled by the most noted editor in the trade . The gossip columnistsand the book sections would pick it up , along with Publishers ' Weekly , and it would make as nice a scandal as could be imagined . It would take years for Duncan &; Company to live it down . " I 've just thought of something , " he heard himself say . " It seems to me that Mr. Duncan is on the right track  --  Wales must have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that he did n't . In that case , he must have authorized them . " He was not rewarded with the more cheerful expressions that he realized he half expected . It was unwise in any conference to give the impression that you thought you had lapped the field , and it was particularly unwise in a conference with Mr. Barlowe . If he had thought about that beforehand , he might not have spoken so hastily . He waited for the troubled frown that always creased Mr. Barlowe 's forehead when he was displeased  --  the brown badge of peevishness , Eugene Hollister once called it  --  only to find himself rewarded with a benevolent nod . " There is something to what Anson says , " Mr. Barlowe commented . " If he should happen to be correct , and if these withdrawals were authorized , there must be some evidence of it  --  something in writing from Wales . Such evidence would change the whole look of things , of course . We would have nothing to worry about . You fellows would be proved right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Personally , though I do n't know the lady , I 'd say that what she needs is a good reining in . " " What about it , Van ? " Anson said . " Have you checked to see if there were any letters from Wales to Phil  --  letters that bear specifically upon these withdrawals ? " Van Buren Bliss had just lit another match . Blowing it out , he said , " Not yet . So far I have n't been able to find a thing . I still have some more searching to do , but there 's not much hope on that score , I 'm afraid . Phil was more than careful about any dealings that involvedthe firm . Going through his files this morning , I came across one that he must have made himself  --  I recognized his lettering on the tab . It contained all his memos to the accounting department , instructing it to draw these various amounts from Garvin 's account and to make the checks payable to him , but I could n't find a scrap of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That still does n't prove anything ! " John Duncan said heatedly . " Garvin was always calling Phil on the phone . None of this had to be put in writing . Damn it , the mere fact that Phil kept that file proves that Garvin knew about it ! If Phil had something to hide --  " " No one has said that he had , " Mr. Barlowe observed . " That 's not the question . I find it hard to believe , though , that there is nothing from Wales on the subject . We know that these withdrawals took place over a period of twenty-one years . It seems incredible to me that our friend Greene was acting solely on verbal instructions all that time . What about those periods when Wales was out of the coun-try ? " Yes , Anson thought . What about them ? How could Garvin Wales give verbal instructions to Phil Greene when he was off in all those far corners of the globe ? If any of the others had ever sat through a trial , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damaging question . Any judge , reviewing the evidence thus far , would have to charge the jury that it demanded the defendant be found guilty as charged . But still it was impossible ! There was bound to be an answer and there was one man who could provide it . Phillip Greene could no longer speak , but Garvin Wales could speak for him . Why did n't they go straight to him , then ? Why all this beating around the bush ? He was about to put the question when Mr. Barlowespoke again . " Mind you , " he said , " I am not arguing that it was impossible for Greene to have been acting on verbal instructions . It could have happened . I am only pointing out that it is difficult to believe . And6oyou say , Mr. Bliss , that you found nothing in the way of an authorization . Nothing at all ? " " Nothing , " Bliss said . " It may be that a more thorough search of Garvin 's correspondence will turn up something , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all his letters to Phil from1936 to 1940 --  " " Why those particular dates ? " Mr. Barlowe asked . " The withdrawals were most frequent during those years , " Bliss replied . " It occurred to me that if Garvin had been writing to Phil about them  --  " " A logical conclusion , " Mr. Barlowe said . " But let me ask this  --  during the years you have mentioned , 1936 to 1940 I believe you said they were , do we have any reason to suppose that our friend Greene was in  --  well , in financial trouble ? " " No , we have n't ! " John Duncan said . " It so happens that Phil 's mother died in 1934 and that Phil 's share of the estate came to more than eighty thousand dollars  --  that on top of what he already had . So if you 're thinking that Phil had his hand in the till because he was strapped , you 're wrong ! Damn it , Charlie , stop acting like a lawyer ! Phil was acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But will the court ? " said Mr. Barlowe . " Let 's be reasonable , gentlemen . As things now stand , it would appear to the average person  --  andjuries are composed of average persons , let me assure you  --  that Greene misappropriated these funds for his own use . Unless we can prove  --  not assume , prove  --  that these withdrawals were made with Wales 's knowledge and consent , I 'm afraid we are in a most vulnerable position . " " What about Wales ? " Anson said . " Is n't he the answer ? If he tells us --  " " In that event , all our troubles are over , " Mr. Barlowe replied . " I will be getting to Mr. Wales and the value of his testimony soon . All I am doing now is to show what I think is clear to all of us  --  that our whole case rests upon what Mr. Wales has to say . But before we talk about that , I 'd like to ask one more question . Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter ? " There was a heavy pause . Anson knew that Mr. Barlowe had drilled his way to a particularly sensitive nerve , and the expression on Mr. Barlowe 's face showed that he knew it too . " Tell him about those checks you found , Van , " John Duncan said . " Let 's wind this up . " Van Buren Bliss reached for the folder he had brought to the meet-61ing . Picking it up , he said , " I found this in Phil 's personal files . It is ticketed only with the initials A.J. , as you can see . It was clipped to the file in which we found Phil 's memos to the accounting department , the ones in which he gave instructions to have those sums of money transferred from Garvin 's account . " " And its contents ? " Mr. Barlowe inquired . " Sixty-four checks , " Bliss replied , matching the crispness of Mr. Barlowe 's tone . " They were all made out by Phil and they were all drawn against his personal account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was another , longer pause . " This Anna Jones ? " Mr. Barlowe asked . " Who is she ? " Van Buren Bliss shook his head . " I do n't know . Neither does John or Paul . We never heard Phil mention her , and her name appears nowhere on our books . This was obviously some personal matter of Phil 's . But the curious thing --  " Mr. Barlowe leaned forward on his elbows , peering across the table . " Yes ? " " Well , two things , " Bliss said . " The first is that the period covered by these checks is twenty-one years  --  the same , you will remember , as that covered by the withdrawals . The second is that the total amount of the checks comes to twenty thousand dollars . " " But that 's not all , " Paul Tarbell broke in . " The number of checks tallies exactly with the number of withdrawals . I had just finished making a list of them when Van found the checks . We compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hold on a second , " Mr. Barlowe cautioned . " Let 's take these jumps one at a time . Am I correct in understanding that there were sixty-four withdrawals from Garvin Wales 's account and sixty-four checks made out to Anna Jones ? " " That 's right , " Paul Tarbell said . " Furthermore , the dates on the checks show that Phil made them out a day or two after he sent those memos to the accounting department . Here , let me show you . " He opened the folder he had consulted previously and brought out first a canceled check and then a small , square sheet of paper that bore a typewritten notation . Handing the latter to Mr. Barlowe , he said , " I-sere is a memo from Phil to the accounting department . It is dated April 1 , 1938 , and is in the same form as all the others . It instructsour account people to deduct $250 from Wales 's account and to make the check payable to Phil . Now here "  --  he handed the canceledcheck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's checks made out62to Anna Jones . It is for $250 and is dated April 2 , 1938 , the very next day after Phil 's memo . Now , if that does n't prove --  " " Prove what ? " Mr. Barlowe 's tone was one of gentle rebuke . " All that is proved is that our friend Greene wrote out a number of checks totaling twenty thousand dollars to a certain Anna Jones . Beyond that it proves nothing . It would appear , I agree , that there is , or was , a close relation between the withdrawals and the checks , but proof  --  what could it prove ? " " That Phil was acting for Garvin ! " John Duncan almost shouted . " That he was withdrawing these sums from Garvin 's account and paying them over to this Anna Jones . All right ! " He cut himself short , glaring at Mr. Barlowe . " Suppose that what you 're thinking is true ! It could n't be , but suppose it was  --  suppose that Phil had this Anna Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rob Garvin to foot the bills ! Do n't be a fool ! And do you think he would have kept the checks he sent her , or even sent her checks at all ? If that 's what you 're thinking --  " " It so happens , John , " Mr. Barlowe said , " that I have n't been thinking along those lines at all . I am simply trying to point out that these checks do nothing but indicate  --  not prove , mind you , indicate  --  how our friend Greene might have disposed of the twenty thousand dollars that Mrs. Wales claims he misappropriated . We are no further along than we were before . What we are required to produce , as I 've said before , is concrete evidence that these sums of money were transferred from Wales 's account with his knowledge and consent . What Greene did with the money need not concern us too much . Not at all , actually . The important thing is to prove that Wales knew what was going on . It is as simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he had listened , he found it hard to tie up all the threads . What Mr. Barlowe was saying , in his cautious way , was that unless Garvin Wales came to the rescue they did n't have a leg to stand on . But who was Anna Jones ? It was easy to believe with John Duncan that Wales had authorized Greene to withdraw the various sums and that Greene , following his instructions , had then sent the money to Anna Jones , but , as Mr. Barlowekept insisting , belief and proof were two different things . It seemed to him that Anna Jones loomed much larger than any of them imagined . What was her relation to Garvin Wales ? And if he wanted to make donations to her that amounted to twenty thousand dollars over a period of twenty-one years , why had he not done so directly ? Why was there nothing in Wales 's correspondence to6 ; Greene that touched on the subject ? And why , most of all , had Greene permitted himself to be drawn into such an embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort , he listened to what Mr. Barlowe was saying . " This letter , John , from Mrs. Wales . It 's your opinion , I believe , that it was sent without her husband 's knowledge . We should all understand , however , that if matters stand to the contrary , then all our speculations about his being aware of these deductions would appear to be unfounded . Should that be the case --  " " Garvin knows nothing about that letter , " John Duncan broke in . " I 'm sure he does n't ! But where is all this getting us ? We 've hashed and rehashed enough . We have to decide what we are going to do . As I told you over the phone , Charlie , I think there is only one way to handle this . If you 've talked it over with Anson , and if you both agree --  " Anson 's name came so suddenly into the conversation that he sat up with a jerk . He was thinking that things were far more complicated than he had ever imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must be explained , and now , without any warning , all eyes were turned in his direction . He wondered what it was that he and Mr. Barlowe were supposed to have agreed about , and why Mr. Barlowe had not got around to mentioning it . " I thought it best for us to go over the whole situation together , " Mr. Barlowe said , addressing John Duncan but also including Anson . " Besides , I did n't get everything you said . I felt that you might like to explain it to Anson directly . He understands , however , that all this is going to be in his hands . Frankly , I 'm glad it will be . I would n't know how to begin with these artistic people . Suppose you tell him what 's on your mind . " Anson sat waiting , aware that everyone was watching him . " This is the way it is , Anson , " John Duncan said . " It 's obvious that the only person who can clear this up for us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for us . It 's not going to be as easy as it sounds . Lucy has him a prisoner on that island as much as if he were behind bars . You know the island , do n't you ? Tamburlaine , it 's called . " " Yes sir , " Anson said . " I know it . " " It 's going to be up to you to get to Garvin , " John Duncan continued . " We 'll discuss the strategy later on . But the only way you 'll be able to talk with him is by working through Lucy  --  you know he 's blind , do n't you ? " 64 " Yes sir , " Anson said . " Unless you make friends with Lucy , or get on her good side , it 's unlikely that she will let you get anywhere near Garvin , " John Duncancontinued . " She 's become more his warden than his wife . Maybe she thinks she is protecting him from the world , or maybe , as Van and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to separate him from every friend he ever had  --  I do n't know ; it 's hard to say . Anyway , this is something that none of us can take on . Things are that strained between us , as you might as well know . Not only that --  " John Duncan went on to explain in detail why it would be impossible for anyone in the firm to go down to see Garvin Wales , but Anson was not listening . He was thinking that Tamburlaine Island was only a few miles down the coast from Pompey 's Head . He was thinking that he had not been there in fifteen years and that now , because Phillip Greene had caused twenty thousand dollars to be transferred from Garvin Wales 's account and had written out twenty thousand dollars ' worth of checks to a woman named Anna Jones , he was going home again . Meg would not like the idea , for she hated being left alone , but there was nothing he could do about it . He was aware that everyone was still looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , sure , Mr. Duncan , " he said . " I 'll be glad to do what I can . " " Good , " John Duncan said . " We 'll talk over the details after lunch . I 've had all I can take on an empty stomach . Where would you fellows like to eat ? We can go to my club , if you like , but the food has n't been up to par lately . How about Louis and Armand 's ? It 's not too late to get a table , is it , Van ? " Van Buren Bliss said he did n't think so , and Paul Tarbell suggested that they might find it more agreeable at the Ivy Room of the Drake . John Duncan agreed that the Drake might be the better idea , at that , because of the rain , and Anson hardly heard them . It had suddenly occurred to him that after fifteen years he would be almost a stranger in Pompey 's Head . All the remaining members of his family had moved away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , the house in which he had grown up and which he always thought of as home , but it really was n't his home any longer and he would have to stay at the Marlborough Hotel . It was something he had never thought of before. 65CHAPTER SIXonly he and Phil knew about . And there is one thing of which you can be sure  --  that Lucy did n't know about it . You can make book on that . " " It could be . " " There is no could ' about it . I know what I 'm talking about , believe me ! What I do n't understand is why Phil went along . If it was something  --  well , rotten  --  I know he would n't have . He must have been convinced that Garvin was doing the right thing  --  not in coveringup his tracks , necessarily , but in sending that money to Anna Jones . Anyway "  --  he rose from his desk and began to pace the floor of his office  --  " this is something that we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know it , too . If you and Charlie are right , we do n't stand much of a chance  --  without a statement from Garvin to clear him , Phil stands convicted . That 's the way it is , is n't it ? " " Yes sir , I 'm afraid so . " John Duncan continued walking up and down . " Not that I 'm not thinking of my own skin too , mind you ! Ca n't you see what the papers will make of it ? Let 's suppose , for the sake of the argument , that we can show that Phil was acting for Garvin . Let 's suppose that we could prove that Anna Jones was some biddy that Garvin was laying regularly , keeping Lucy in the dark , and that Phil , knowing this --  No , it 's too fantastic ! Much as he was willing to do for Garvin , Phil would n't do that . But the important thing is that none of this gets out  --  we owe that much to Phil . So either you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . And unless you can arrange to meet her on a friendly basis , through some of those connections of yours --  " How , though ? The connections upon which John Duncan placed such importance were the very threads he had deliberately cut in two . Some of his old crowd was bound to be left , and a few of his friends , but one by one he had lost touch with them during the years he had been away . It would be awkward to ask favors , except of Wyeth Blackford , with whom he had corresponded until their lives took such different turnings that there was nothing left to correspond about , and , besides , it seemed unlikely that any of them would be on friendly terms with Mrs. Wales . How to go about it , then ; what was the best way to proceed ? He was considering the problem when the porter appeared again . He smiled genially as he poked his head into the roomette . Remembering that his name was Thomas McElroy , Anson was again reminded of the McElroys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River . Ten days had passed since the meeting at Duncan &; Company , and in ten minutes the train would be pulling into the Lafayette Street station . Anson told himself that he had better start thinking about the job in hand . " Your being our lawyer is bound to get you off on the wrong foot , " John Duncan had warned at their last meeting . " You 'll have two strikes against you before you start . As our lawyer , just as our lawyer , Lucy wo n't let you get anywhere near Garvin . She 'll probablyinsult you for invading what she calls their privacy . As I told you the other day when Charlie was here , she keeps Garvin on that island as though he were a prisoner . She 's always had a hold on him  --  a damned powerful hold  --  and now that he is blind he is more dependent on her than ever . So being our lawyer will get you nowhere . But if you could arrange to meet her socially , through some of these connections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not saying it will . All I say is that it may make it easier for you to get to Garvin  --  damn it , Anson , I know he can tell us what this is all about . All you need is half an hour with him alone . I do n't know what it was he wanted to keep quiet --  " " You 're thinking of those checks to Anna Jones ? " John Duncan nodded . " What 's behind them , up to now , was none of our business . But with Lucy 's dragging Phil into it , making these threats --  " His voice changed and he gave way to one of his fits of impatience . " What the hell , Anson  --  who are we trying to kid ! If Garvin persuaded Phil to act as some kind of pay-off man , as we think he did , he must have had something to hide  --  something that66 1 67 " It wo n't be long now , sir , " the porter said . " Brush you off ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's something I 've been wanting to ask  --  I hope you do n't mind . " " No sir . " " Your name caused me to wonder about it . Do you happen to befrom Pompey 's Head ? " The porter nodded . " That 's right . I live in Florida now  --  have to , account of this run  --  but Old Pompey is where I 'm from . Just outside , that is . " " Bugtown ? " " No , now ! " The porter smiled again . " You know Bugtown ? " " The S- &-S; Feed Company , Galloway 's Cafe , the Oasis , the FirstAfrican Baptist Church --  " The porter began to chuckle . " The S- &-S; and Mr. Galloway 's  --  Iai n't heard tell of them since I do n't know when . " He stopped chuckling and regarded Anson with mild puzzlement . " But that was a long time ago , my time . The S- &-S,; it 's closed down , and Mr.Galloway , he 's dead . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a boy named Tooker McElroy --  " " Tooker ? You know Tooker ? " The porter focused his attentionupon Anson with renewed interest . " He 's my third cousin on my mother 's side , my second cousin 's oldest . But those McElroys , Tooker'speople , they ai n't from Bugtown . They come from DoubleCrossing . " " Frenchman 's Creek , Little River , the road to the old Blackfordplace , ' Willie Randall 's general store --  " The porter broke into a pleased , rumbling laugh . " That 's rightthat 's the Crossing for sure ! And here I had you figured for a Northernman . It just goes to show ! But Tooker , he ai n't been around for ten-twelve years . He 's working in Philadelphia . If you knewTooker --  " Anson decided to clear up the mystery for him . " It was when wewere boys , a long time ago . I do n't live in Pompey 's Head any more . I 've been away for years . " " I see , sir . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commiseration ; it was as if he wanted to indicate that he , too , knew what it meant to be an exile . " I reckon that 's how come I took you for a Northern man . " " Yes , I reckon it is . " It was a word " reckon " that had long since been dropped from hisvocabulary  --  you did n't say " reckon " in the chambers of Roberts , 68Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul , nor in any of the places to which they happened to lead . But here it was again , coming naturally as ever ; he might have been saying " reckon " right along . It was nothing to be especially pleased about , but pleased he was  --  at least he had not forgottenhow to speak his native tongue . And he was pleased , too , that he had been correct in his surmise ; " Old Pompey , " the porter had said , and that was all he needed to know . " You going home on a visit ? " the porter asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have some business to look after . " " Yes sir , I see . " The porter spoke in a more impersonal tone . Bugtownand Double Crossing were areas of shared affection , business a strange , puzzling country into which he was disinclined to venture . " Well , do n't forget your overcoat when you leave . We 'll be crossing the river most any time now . " Pompey 's Head lay on the south side of the Cassava River , sixteen miles from the sea . Half a mile wide and providing ample draft for ocean-going vessels , the Cassava was responsible for Pompey 's Head being where it was  --  the founding fathers , " The Twenty Families of Marlborough County " as they were generally known , had laid it out on a high bluff that overlooked the river and receded westward into a broad , fertile plain . Sir Samuel Alwyn , who in 1720 had commanded the first boatload of political exiles hustled from England to the Southern plantations in the sailing vessel Swan , wrote in his diary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stretch of river where it had first been sighted , " had the plaine outline of a human countenance , witnessed in profile , and of a most noble and majestikal meine . " Anson , like all the other schoolboys of his time , had been made to commit this part of Sir Samuel 's diary to heart  --  it was because of this " plaine outline " and " most noble and majestikal meine " that the settlement had been named Pompey 's Head . Responsible for the location of Pompey 's Head , the river was likewiseresponsible for its importance as a port  --  not nearly so bustling in recent times as in the great pre-Civil War days of cotton and river traffic , when hundreds of thousands of bales were brought down by steamboat from over two hundred miles inland and then shippedabroad , but still busy enough to rival Charleston and Savannah . The it volume of Sir Samuel 's diary always on display in the Founders ' Room of the Pompey 's Head Historical Museum was the one in which he stressed the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summed up , " the temperature of the climate , the salubritie of the air , and the richness69of the soile , and , above all else , the safe convenient harbour near the mouth of the deep river , which is called by the Indians Cassava , after an edible roote which they say used to be plentiful in the neighborhood , make this place one that affords , or can produce , whatsoever , most things affected by man , either for pleasure or profit . " For pleasure or profit  --  again , for no good reason , Anson felt pleased . He had n't thought of Sir Samuel Alwyn in years , much less the faded pages of the diary that every eighth-grade class in Pompey 's Head made a special visit to see . He was surprised to find that he could still remember even the irregular spelling the English nobleman had used to commit his colonizer 's thoughts to paper . Sir Samuel 's diary , however , was one of the points on which his life had turned  --  on it , as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambition . He too was in the eighth grade when he saw the diary for the first time . Their teacher , Miss Harrigan , had taken them on what Boojum and Beejum , the husband and wife who were at the head of Patrick 's school in New York , would call a field trip  --  to Miss Harrigan it was a visit to the museum , but to Boojum and Beejum it would be a field trip . He knew about the museum , which was in the building that had been the home of Sir Richard Montague when he was royal governor of the colony  --  the best example of Georgian architecture in the state , his father said , if not in all the South  --  but he had never visited it before . The old mansion faced on Montague Square . There was a large bronze statue of General Robert Carvell in the square , standing on a block of native granite . The inscription told how General Carvell had been the only general in the Revolutionary Army who came from Pompey 's Head , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Pigeon Marsh . Embedded in the earth on one side of the statue was a slab of rough-hewn stone to which was affixed a copper plaque . The legend on the plaque said that the square had once been occupied by a statue of Sir Richard Montague , which had been melted down for cannon balls by the patriots of Pompey 's Head during the Revolution , and that the statue of General Carvell had been erected in its place by a grateful citizenry in 1825-Lafayette , it concluded , was an honored guest at the unveiling . Miss Harrigan , their teacher , had lined them up in twos near the statue . Anson noticed that the general 's hat was gray and spotted where the pigeons had been , and that his cheeks were streaked in a way that made him seem to be shedding big , thick tears . Anson70started to call Ian Garrick 's attention to it , Ian being his best friend next to Wyeth Blackford , who was n't at school because he had snagged a bass plug in his lip and let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Midge Higgins to pay him any mind . Everybodyelse was scrubbed and polished in his Sunday best , but Midge wore the same bright red dress she had on the day before . Midge was a new girl . She had been in the class only a few months . She lived on the far end of Hampton Street , one block away from what was called the Irish Channel , and her father was a conductor on the Marlborough Drive line . Miss Harrigan , in class that morning , had tried to impress them with the educational value of the visit they were about to make , but Midge had turned up her nose . " That old museum , " she said to Anson as they were leaving class . " Shinola ! What 's so wonderful about that ! " Midge lived the farthest away from school of any of them . If it was n't that her father was a conductor and she could ride free , she would have had to walk eleven blocks to get to class ; and if she lived just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , instead of the east , side of Hampton , she would have had to go to school in the Channel . Anson knew enough to realize that nearly all the mothers of the other boys and girls wished she did . They did n't think that Midge was a " good influence , " citing the way that " Shinola ! " had been picked up by the eighth grade , and they said that no child her age should be permitted to wear the clothes she did , particularly since she was so " well developed . " One thing , though , they said they could be thankful for  --  at least her two older brothers had gone on to high school before her family moved to the east side of Hampton , and that the youngest one , Mico , was n't yet old enough to attend class . They also said that maybe the Henry Pettibones knew what they were doing , turning that old house on Hampton Street into low-rent apartments , but it seemed to them that all that had been accomplishedwas deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fixed boundary for generations . " Dear old Henry , " Anson 's father said one night . " What did our good friends and neighbors expect  --  that he would keep on paying taxes on that vacant property simply because it was where his ancestors first climbed out of the indentured-servant class ? That 's what they were , you know . It is one of Henry 's many crosses that none of his ancestors was in the Swan , the Discovery , or the London Merchant  --  his having married an Olney has n't helped much , either , since the first Olney , Isaac , came over as a shoemaker . And in the71fifth contingent , at that . " Anson 's father gave an exaggerated chuckle and then began to cough . It had a dry , rasping sound . " I do wish you 'd do something about that cough , " Anson 's mother said . " It does n't sound right to me . Should n't you see a doctor ? " " No , I should n't . It just comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut down . So our good friends and neighbors are exercised about Henry 's inviting the Channel to move into that property of his , are they ? " He shook his head . " Poor old Henry . He does n't worship the Almighty Dollar  --  his is the shrine of the Almighty Dime . And it must be extremely trying to be a frustrated Shintoist . Henry 's heaviest burden is that he wants to live up to a tradition and has no tradition to live up to  --  what kind of a tradition is an indenturedservant and rents from the Channel and Duppytown ? And so far as that property of his is concerned , history is simply repeating itself . When the first Pettibones moved in and began to act like quality  --  they did n't build that house , you know ; it was the Archer house originally  --  they were in effect making the jump from the Irish Channel of their day . " He coughed again , shielding his mouth with his hand . " As a matter of fact , if some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to admit that they came from stock that was no better than these Higginses we 've been hearingso much about . It may be the carpetbagger in me coming out , but I think I 'll write a letter to Joe Birke on the News . " Anson 's mother said he would n't dare  --  she seemed truly alarmed at the idea of his father writing a letter to the editor . Anson was surprised because he thought anyone could see that his father was only joking . He knew that his mother tried to take what she called a sensible view of the Higginses . She said that while it was unfortunate that the old Archer house could not be preserved in its original state , the Pettibones had the right to do what they wanted with the property , and the Higginses , on their part , had just as much right to want to better themselves by moving out of the Channel  --  there was nothing wrong in being a conductor and it was quite possible that they were nice people . Anson 's sister Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this let out a howl , She said that if her mother knew Joe Higgins , the one who was a sophomore , and some of the things he did --  " All right , then ! " Anson 's father interrupted sharply . " If that 's the case , you keep away from the Higgins boys ! Meanwhile , live and let live . " All this conversation had the effect of making Midge doubly more attractive . Standing in line with the others in Montague Square , 72Anson wished he had managed to get paired off with her instead of getting stuck with Olive Paxton , the least popular girl in class . Olive had mentioned four times already that she was General Carvell 's great-great-grandniece on her mother 's side , just as if she did n't talk about him nearly every day , along with her other ancestors , but if she thought that ancestors could make up for her peaked face and skinny legs and lank , mouse-colored hair , she was crazy , that 's what . Besides , she had gone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vinegar rinses that the colored people thought were good for a girl 's hair , and she still smelled of it faintly  --  Anson , feeling more and more put upon , aware that Olive liked him better than any of the other boys and that his getting stuck with her was bound to be twisted around as being his own design , just as if she were his girl , said to himself that she smelled the way the dining room did when his father was in one of his sophisticated moods , as Marion called them , and decided to mix the French dressing and dripped some of the vinegar on the table . Midge Higgins , four couples in front of him , had none of Olive 's spectacular disadvantages . Her round , animated face was set off with a bright mouth and a pair of shiny blue eyes , her blond hair was cut in a boyish bob , and her tight red dress showed all the lines of her figure . Anson noticed that her bosom was most as full as those of any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ladies who played bridge with his mother meant when they said she was so well developed . " Ian Garrick said that Midge was built like a brick outhouse and kissed with her mouth open the way they did in the movies , but that was just his talking big again , like the time he said he had taken so many swigs out of his father 's decanter of whisky that the room went round and round  --  Ian was like that , always blowing off big about something , just as Wyeth Blackford said . Anson was watching Ian fool around with Midge , saying things that made her giggle , when Miss Harrigan clapped her hands for silence . Olive Paxton straightened up , as did most of the other children , but Ian and Midge went right on giggling  --  " You , Ian ! " Miss Iarrigan said . " You , Midge ! Do I have to teach you to mind ! " Miss Harrigan was also dressed in her Sunday best . She wore a dove-colored dress with a lace collar that Anson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of brownish wings . Anson thought that if Wyeth Blackford were there he would say it was lucky for her that he did n't have his shotgun along , and he amused himself for a moment thinkingabout Wyeth Blackford stalking Miss Harrigan 's hat behind one73of the clumps of azaleas that were still in bloom  --  Wyeth would get that pair of wings the first crack , too ; he was the best shot of all the younger boys . Stealing another glance at Midge , Anson tried to consolehimself by remembering that he was the next best shot to Wyeth , and that Ian Garrick , with all that biggity talk of his , could n't hit the side of a barn . He was brought back to reality by another clap of Miss Harrigan 's hands . " Remember what you were told , " she said . " No speaking in loud voices and no touching . Not anything , understand ! These are priceless relics you are about to see , hundreds of years old . All right , children , follow me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a few automobileswere baking in the sun along the curb and an old Negro in a battered felt hat was pushing a high-wheeled cart loaded with vegetables , on his way to peddle his produce from door to door , and then , quiet now , even Ian and Midge behaving themselves , they went up the steps of the museum . As soon as he entered the building , Anson had the feeling that he was in church  --  not on Sunday , when the bells were ringing and there were lots of people , but on one of those weekday afternoons when his mother , who was a member of the Altar Guild , had to change the linen and polish the brass . He found himself in a long , wide hall in which a flight of white stairs curved to the rooms above  --  there was a moment 's confused impression of flags and charts and maps , of gold-framed portraits of men in colorful uniforms and outmoded dress , of things in cabinets and other things behind glass , and then he was off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various articles were . He saw a likeness of George Washington woven in silk in France , a storm flag of the Confederate cruiser Shenandoah , the torn and faded regimental banner the Pompey 's Head Light Infantry had carried all through the War between the States , a view of the port in 1835 , and , in one of the glass cases , the famous " Little Pigeon Flag . " It did not look like a flag to Anson , just a piece of needlework with roses and leaves and forget-me-nots  --  " This square of embroidery , " the card said , " was ripped from the back of an armchair in her father 's plantation home by Margaret Jennor ( later Mrs. John Williams ) and presented to Colonel William Washington for his cavalry colors . The flag receivedits baptism of fire at the Battle of Little Pigeon Marsh in 178o and was also borne at the Battle of Cowpens . It , was later presented by Mrs. Williams to the Pompey 's Head Light Infantry . " Anson was so absorbed in what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoke of battle a fearless drummer boy with a bandaged forehead who bore an astonishing resemblance to himself , that it needed a severe " Pstt ! Pstt ! " from Miss Harrigan to make him join the others . They went then into a handsome chamber just off the hall , paneled in white and lighted by two fan windows . It was identified by a little sign that hung from the doorway as the Founders ' Room . Here were more portraits , twenty in all , and , spelled out in gilt letters on the walls above the portraits , so arranged that they made a kind of decoration , the names of " The Twenty Families of Marlborough County "  --  those who had come over with Sir Samuel Alwyn in the Swan . One portrait , larger than the others , was that of Sir Samuel himself  --  a heavy-cheeked , square-jawed man in a white wig and a snuff-colored coat with brass buttons and large turned-back cuffs . Beneath it stood a single glass case , the only piece of furniture on that side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it in fours ; it made Anson think of church again , the hushed , solemn time when people went up to the altar to receive communion . At first he felt a sag of disappointment  --  there was nothing but some handwriting in the case , each sheet of paper weighted down by a small , oblong strip of glass , along with a copybook that was hardly different from the ones they used in school . But then , as he began to read the faded but still distinct handwriting that covered the pages of the copybook  --  written in metallic ink , he was later to learn  --  he felt a strange thing happening , beyond his ability to explain . To think that these lines had been written when Pompey 's Head was nothing but a little clearing in the woods ; to believe that that far time and the time of today could be brought so close together  --  andat that moment , beyond the awareness that Ian Garrick was trying to hold Midge Higgins 's hand and that Sir Samuel Alwyn was looking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew what he wanted to do when he grew up . He now had something with which to answer his father . When he grew up he wanted to find out all about these dusty , forgotten things and what they meant , and tell about them  --  did n't Miss Harrigan say he was better in Compositionthan anything else ? Sitting in his roomette , Anson had to shake his head . All he could show for that early ambition was The Shinto Tradition of the AmericanSouth . He felt a certain protective tenderness for the boy he had been , much like the feeling he had for his son Patrick , and it wasnot the boy 's fault that he did not know there was no future in being a local historian . It was just as Meg had said when he told her that if he had the time he thought he might still like to write a short social history of Pompey 's Head  --  " Do n't be silly ! Who in the world would be interested ? Now if it were a historical novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stretches of marshland fell away on either side , the tall , still grasses black in the early light and a few circling hawks in the sky , and then Anson caught sight of the Cassava River  --  the tracks followed it for a short distance before they crossed the bridge that led to the environs of Pompey 's Head . Once again Anson could feel his heart beat faster ; memories came with such a rush that everything was memory  --  the stretch of water just below the Blackford place where you could catch both fresh-water and salt-water fish ; the old rice fields where the ducks settled on the ponds ; the deer country between the north shore of the river and Ockeesawba Lake ; the deeper swampland where he got his first wild turkey ; the night when he and Wyeth Blackford and Ian Garrick were returning from Joe Ann Williams 's coming-out party and wrecked Ian 's brand-new car . All his customary points of reference were in a state of flux and dissolution ; even Meg and the children had receded into the distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have drifted into the country of neither-here-nor-there . He felt momentarilysuspended in space , discharged from the obligation of participationand able to regard himself as one of the proponents of his own drama  --  he recalled that there was something in Aristotle about this , and that there had been a reference to it in one of the books he had to read when he was taking his cram course to prepare for the New York bar examinations , but he could not remember where it was . The train was now crossing the river . The slow-moving water , yellowish-red and silt-laden , broke into little whirlpools where it washed against the pilings of the bridge , and off to the left he could see the four or five multiple-story buildings that made up the skylineof Pompey 's Head  --  not much , he thought , the usual frustrated ambitions of a provincial American town . The speed of the train began to slacken after it crossed the river , and he saw that it was passing through the Negro quarter that lay on the north side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of sagging frame houses from which every last bit of paint had flaked and fallen , leaving them to take on the dead gray tones of ashes long forgotten in a cold , neglected hearth . The back yards were crisscrossed with lines76that bellied on Mondays with the white folks ' washing , there were patterns of footprints in the dust beneath the queen-of-China trees , a few skinny dogs roamed about with the ravenous lope of hunger , and in the rank weeds of an empty lot the rusty skeleton of an ancient car lay disemboweled on its side . Duppytown , Anson thought ; Duppytownthe Beautiful . He put on his hat , picked up his briefcase , threw his topcoat across his arm , and walked down the corridor to the end of the pullrnan . They were pulling into the station , and the porter was already opening the door . " Well , sir , " he said genially . " We made it . " " Yes , " Anson replied . " So I see . " 77PART TWOCHAPTER SEVENHe saw , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lafayette Street station  --  this might be any one of those mornings when he had risen early and driven the family car down to the station to meet his father , who was returning from New York on the five forty-six . Handing over his baggage to a small , wizened Negro whose coffeecoloredeyes peered out disconsolately from beneath the peak of a faded red cap , Anson followed him down the concrete ramp that led to the iron gates that stood at the end of the tracks . Only one other passenger had left the train . He was a portly man in a gray homburg and blue suit who strode past briskly , tagged after by a second redcap , who seemed already to be panting with the effort to keep up with him . Anson tried to imagine what his hurry was and when he reached the waiting room he found out . A dark-haired girl who appeared to be about twenty burst through the doors that led to the street and ran up to the man , crying , " Oh , Daddy , I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good trip ? " She threw her arms about him , gave him a kiss , and they went chatting into the street  --  Anson , following his redcap , wondered who they were . Once he would have known and now he did n't and there never was a time when he felt so much a stranger and so alone . Here it was again  --  the grimy station with its waiting room of yellow brick ; the rows of wooden benches divided by the brass rail demanded by Jim Crow ; the two ticket windows , one on either side of the rail ; the bulletin boards where the schedules of the trains used to be posted by one of Midge Higgins 's many uncles ; the all-night lunch counter with its lights still burning and where a stout woman in a soiled , wrinkled smock was slumped down81wearily on her elbows , turning the pages of a picture magazine  --  here it was again , even to the smell of coal-tar disinfectant used to swab the floors , and here he was again , lonely and alien as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " You want a cab , sir ? " the redcap asked . " Yes . Please . " " May be one . " The redcap looked doubtful . " This time of morning , it 's hard to say . I can phone one for you , though . " It turned out that he had to telephone . Anson stood in front of the station , listening to his high , put-upon voice speaking into a box telephone attached to the wall . He hung up the receiver and turned to Anson . " One 's coming right away , " he said . " Should be one , without me having to phone , but this time of morning , they seem to figure it 's too early to get up . " This business of having to telephone was plainly a deep , galling grievance  --  his face took on a new set of wrinkles , glum and petulant . Anson tipped him with a dollar bill , not only because he seemed to be in such need of cheering but also because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the garden and who had the same kind of grievance against weeds  --  " Pull , pull , pull ! And for what ? Just to pull , pull all over again ! Why is weeds , anyhow ? What good is they ? " Not knowing about Henry , unaware that this white stranger was offering up a sacrifice at the altar of his family gods , the redcap fingered the dollar bill gingerly  --  it took him several minutes to comprehend that he was not expected to make change . His face took on much the same cast as did Henry 's when Anson 's mother told him that the rest of the weeds could go until tomorrow , and his " Thank you , thank you , " reminded Anson of Henry 's " Praise be for something ! Praise be ! " Anson told the redcap that he need not wait any longer . Looking dubious , the Negro said he 'd better , just in case he had to phone again . Anson knew it was primarily the dollar working and possibly , behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger who seemed to be a kindly man , but he was glad to have his company nonetheless  --  he preferred not to stand all by himself on Lafayette Street , waiting for a cab to take him to the MarlboroughHotel . Lafayette Street was where all the stores that catered to the colored trade were , where he and Joe Ann Williams used to spend hours listening to phonograph records that could be had in no other part of town , and in the new wash of memory that brokeover him , bearing the fleeting figures of so many shadowy presences , it was comforting to have a living companion , even though it was a baggy , wrinkled Negro he had never seen before and would probably never see again . " Tell me , " he said . " Does Vicksburg still have his record shop ? " " Vicksburg ? " The redcap twisted his face into an expression of deep concentration . " Oh , you mean the one who used to play the guitar . No sir , he do n't have that shop no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down  --  there 's a movie theater there now . " " And Vicksburg ? What happened to him ? " " That I ca n't say , sir . He ai n't been around in years . Seems like I heard that he went to live in Atlanta , but I ca n't rightly recollect for sure . You know how it is  --  so many folks coming and going , especially when the war was on , that a man ca n't keep them straight . But Vicksburg , I ai n't seen him around in a long time  --  he was getting to be an old man . " Not so old , Anson started to tell him . Were Vicksburg to come walking up the street he would not be much more than sixty . And well preserved in the alcohol in which he used to steep himself night after night during the years when he played his guitar in the band at the Oasis . The affairs of the record shop were looked after by his wife . Vicksburg himself rarely appeared on Lafayette Street until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white teeth and a tremendouslaugh ; unheard of beyond the borders of Pompey 's Head , but one of the world 's great natural musicians . No party was completewithout Vicksburg , who besides playing in the band at the Oasis had his own quartet , and no one had a wider acquaintance among the younger white people in town . Anson was about to ask the redcap if the Oasis in Bugtown was still standing , but just then the cab arrived . The driver , a young man with a pale , narrow face and a pair of ferret-like eyes , hopped out and loaded Anson 's luggage into the front seat . " Where to ? " he asked . " The Pompey Arms ? " " No , the Marlborough . " Anson found it revealing that the driver should imagine he would be going to the Pompey Arms . It was the new , modern hotel ( new and modern for Pompey 's Head ; erected in 1923 ) and greatly favored above the Marlborough , that old-fashioned , high-ceilinged pile . The cab went north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store fronts that had not yet opened for the day , and turned east on Independence Street , where the Marlborough stood , two blocks from82 83Monmouth Square . Independence was one of the easier streets on which to drive , Anson remembered . Taking it , you did not have to circumnavigate the various squares which , much as they contributed to the city 's character , presented a bothersome traffic problem . Anson was thinking how green everything was , and how even so prosaic a street as Independence borrowed a verdant beauty from the oaks and magnolias that grew on either side , when he heard the driver speak . " Stranger ? " " Yes , sort of . " " That 's what I figured . " The driver crooked his neck and looked at Anson in the rear-vision mirror . " It ai n't a bad town , thoughkeepspicking up right along . That 's why I come . I figured a man could do himself some good here , not that I call driving this cab doing me much good . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New York ? " Anson said yes , he was , and the driver said that that was a town he sure intended to see . He spoke in the nasal twang of the upcountry , the one-crop plateau that stretched into the interior until it met the red clay hills that rose into the mountains of North Carolina , and even without the reference to chopping cotton Anson would have known him as a countryman tired of the backbreak of a tenant farm . The driver was telling about the things he wanted to see in New York  --  " That Music Hall theater they got there ; my cousin in the Navy , he sent me a postcard with its picture on it "  --  when a small , neatly dressed Negro woman with gray hair , carrying a basket over one arm , stepped into the street . The driver honked his horn , and as she hurriedly regained the curb he gave a soft , throaty chuckle . " Now what do you reckon that old nigger is out this early in the morning for ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here it was again , that loathsomeword . Here , conjured up out of nowhere by an ignorant countryman , were all the things that had caused him to leave Pompey 's Head . And out of the past , set adrift by the lock 's quick turning , two shadowy figures  --  a small , anxious , fearful boy and a tall , irate , white-haired man , himself and his grandfather . " Young sir , you ever let me hear you use that word again , just once , and I 'll thrash you so that you 'll still be feeling it when Gabriel blows his horn . They are colored people , understand . Colored , yes , but people . And those who use that word , those who call them nigger , make themselves out to be less , far less , than the lowliest of those they pretend to despise . You understand what I 'm saying , do n't you ? Remember , then . You 'll not get a chance to hear me say it again ! " The driver returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " That Empire State Building , now that must be something for sure ; my cousin , he sent me a postcard of it too "  --  and Anson tried to shut his ears against the sharp drill of his voice . By the time they reached the Marlborough , he was holding himself so rigidly that he was reminded of Mr. Barlowe . That carrying things a bit too far , he relaxedhis shoulders , paid off the driver , and stepped from the cab . There was no sign of a porter , and the driver offered to carry his bags into the hotel . Anson told him he need not bother . The man had spoiled the morning and he was glad to see him go . The Marlborough Hotel was built in 1889 . Pompey 's Head at that time still had ambitions to become the leading metropolis of the southern Atlantic seaboard . Cotton and rice were firm , tobacco was bringing higher prices than ever , tar and turpentine were in brisk demand , almost any timbering operation was profitable , and the volume of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only blot on the picture was the railroads . The location of Pompey 's Head had proved a serious handicap in that respect , and it had been by-passed by all but one of the major lines . In 1886 , however , with the reorganization of the Atlantic &; Central , which had never managed fully to recover from the loss of tracks , stations , rolling stock , and other equipment destroyed during Sherman 's march to the sea , even this difficulty appeared to be remedied . The rejuvenated Atlantic &; Central , running to Chattanooga and connectingthere with other rails , would enable Pompey 's Head to move its freight as far west as Louisville and Nashville , and thence eastward into Virginia . The future , consequently , had an expansive look  --  the Marlborough was cut to fit the dimensions of a dream . The hotel had not changed since the last time Anson saw it . Built of native red sandstone , it was surmounted on each of its four corners by a crenelated tower that Gaby Carpenter , one of the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Folly . There was a time when the Marlborough 's reputation was exceeded in the South only by the St. Charles in New Orleans , but by Anson 's day it had become the residence of so many aging aunts , uncles , and cousins that it came to be known as the Old Folks Home . It was Gaby Carpenter who christened it with that name . Gaby thought she had literary ambitionsand professed to be bored with Pompey 's Head  --  Pompey's84 85Dread , she called it . Anson suspected that Gaby liked to say such things because she thought they would shock people , and he never could quite see what she got out of it . More to her disadvantage , however , was the fact that , unlike the other girls , who would not be caught dead in anything that looked " Bohemian , " Gaby was forevergetting herself up in some outlandish creation made of red bandannas , or some print she said came from India , or even a piece of burlap . Gaby was tall and thin , with inky-black hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those costumes of hers Anson always felt slightly embarrassed when he met her on the street and had to stop and talk , good friends though they were . In recent years , however , especially since the day 1VIeg came home with an outfit she bought to wear to the Duncans ' for the week end and which consisted of a red bandanna shirtwaist and a voluminous burlapskirt , he had begun to suspect that the only trouble with Gaby Carpenter 's ideas about dress was that they happened to be a little before their time . He was thinking of Gaby , remembering how she persuaded her family to let her have a " studio " on the top floor of an old house the Carpenters owned on Clinton Street , only five blocks from Duppytown , when a porter came out to get his bags . He was too young for Anson to have known him in the past . Anson followed him into the hotel . The lobby was deserted and the porter 's heels made a clacking sound on the tiles with which it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble with their gilt pedimentswere still there , that a glass enclosure had been put up around the reception desk , and that a cozy fire was already burning in the hearth before which the aunts , uncles , and cousins , the widowed and the unwed , used to gather in the evening to knit , play cards , read their mail to each other , and spin the prayer wheel of old times . The clerk was an alert , blond young man , remarkably brisk and amiable for one who had just sat through the long night shift . The way he said that he felt sure Anson would be comfortable in Room 528 identified him as a native . He made " eight " sound like a twosyllableword  --  " aay-ut , " he said , just as did everyone who had ever grown up in Pompey 's Head . " How long will you be with us , Mr. Page ? " he asked . " We have you down for a week . Is that correct ? " " So far as I know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? Do n't you like our town ? " For a moment Anson did not know how to reply. 86 " Why , sure . I like it fine . " " Oh , so you 've been here before . " The clerk smiled pleasantly . " We 're glad you decided to stop with us this time . " It did not seem quite real to Anson , the conversation he was having  --  did n't he like their town and their being glad he had decided to stop with them this time . It was his town , too , and he had stopped with them because he liked the Marlborough , for which his grandfather had put up some of the money , and he suspected that his emotional investment in both the town and the Marlborough was considerably greater than theirs . But how could anyone know ? He felt lonely again , reminded that he was as much a stranger as the clerk took him to be , and for an instant he thought of telling him who he was . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sisters of some of his contemporaries ; being a native of Pompey 's Head , he would almost certainly know their names . But not now , Anson decided . He preferred not to run the risk of polite interest . He did not want to hear the clerk reply , " You do n't say , sir ; now think of that , " and most of all he did not want to hear him say , " Fifteen years ! Well , sir , welcome home . " He would have found it hard to say why , but he did not want to be welcomed home by a clerk in the Marlborough Hotel . " I wonder if I could get some breakfast , " he said . " Is the dining room open ? " " Yes sir , it is , " the clerk replied in his cheerful way . " We open at five forty-five for the convenience of our guests who like to get an early start . A lot of folks stop by to visit us on the way to and from Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our historic spots . " " Yes , I have . " " There 's more to see than most folks realize , " the clerk went on . " We 're smaller than Savannah , and not all painted up like Charleston , but I 've heard a lot of well-traveled people say that Old Pompey is a lot more interesting . " Old Pompey . It still had its hold , Anson thought ; Old Pompey , we love you still . He began to feel warmly disposed toward the young man behind the desk ; there was something about him that brought Wyeth Blackford to mind  --  Wyeth as he was when he used to be a teller in the Merchants &; Mechanics Bank . The clerk seemed to be several cuts above the job he was holding down , just as Wyeth had , and he appeared no less content with what he was doing . " If you wish , sir , " he said , " I could have your bags sent up while87you 're having breakfast . There 's the men 's room if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine . " " Your key will be in your box . Anything we can do , we 'll be more than glad to . We 're happy to have you with us , Mr. Page . " Anson noticed a pile of fresh copies of the Morning News on one side of the desk . He did not have to look twice to see that the paper 's page-one make-up had not changed any . Either old Joe Rawlings was still on the job , which seemed hardly possible , or else somebody was using his dummies as a model . Glancing at the headlines , which seemed to carry the same news as those he had seen in the WorldTelegramand Sun the night before when he was boarding the train in Pennsylvania Station , Anson 's attention was attracted by a small stack of thin books bound in heavy blue paper . He picked one up and looked at the cover . It was decorated with a bird's-eye view of the older part of the city , upon which was superimposed the title , Historical Guide to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters , contained in a box at the bottom of the page , said that it had been compiled and published by the Pompey 's Head Historical Association . " How much is this ? " he asked the clerk . " Seventy-five cents . " " Is it any good ? " " Yes sir , I think so . It 's full of interesting material , if that 's what you mean . " " That 's what I mean . I 'll take a copy of the News too . " " Thank you , sir . Enjoy your breakfast . The entrance to the dining room is just past the elevators on your right . " " Yes , I know . " It was the second or third time he had said " Yes , I know , " that morning and if he was not careful it could turn into a habit . But again it was true  --  he did know . Upon graduating from college he had written a local column for the News for nearly a year and a half , going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Leigh , and during those months Kit Robbins would often have supper with him . If it had been one of the other girls he used to date before he and Kit began going with each other , Joe Ann Williams or Gaby Carpenter or Margie Rhett , they would probably have gone to the Cassava Cafe , a small place near the river front that all the reporters on the News patronized , and where you could get a drink all through Prohibition . However , because it was Kit , they went to the Marlborough . Kit88never felt comfortable in places like the Cassava Cafe . They made her stiff and awkward , and she seemed to be intimidated by the fellows who worked on the News , sitting there silently and never joiningin the fun . Anson could not find fault with Kit and he thought that the dining room of the Marlborough was a wonderful place . It was nothing like the dining rooms of most hotels , simply a long , narrow chamber with a line of glass windows that looked out upon a small garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York when he had wished for a dining room as pleasant as that of the Marlborough . He liked going there with Kit . He was proud of how pretty she was and of the glances that followed her , and it was pleasant to have old Watkins , the Negro headwaiter , show them always to the same table and then inquire about the health of his mother and father , or perhaps say that Wyeth Blackford had been in to have lunch that day . During those times in New York when his thoughts drifted back to Pompey 's Head , Anson often thought that the months when he and Kit Robbins used to have supper at the Marlborough were the happiest of his life . He was working as a freshman lawyer at Garrick &; Leigh , he was seeing his name in print at the head of the column of historical jottings that he wrote three times a week for the Morning News , he fished and hunted in season , and he consideredhimself engaged to Kit  --  it would have been hard , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more . He could now , wondering how it was that he had failed to notice the flaws in the structure , but even with the wisdom of hindsight it was still true  --  be had never known a happier time . A Negro waiter met him at the door , wearing the uniform Anson remembered . It consisted of black trousers , black shoes , a white jacket with brass buttons , and a white shirt worn with a black bow tie . Anson looked to see if he was one of the waiters he had known , but , like the porter at the door , he was much too young . Two other waiters were standing at their stations and everything was as it used to be  --  the regularly spaced tables with their fresh clean cloths , the two serving stands at either end and the one in the middle , the swinging door that led to the kitchen , the line of spotless windows and the palm tree in the garden , near which stood a little fountain that sent its trickle through the early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden , and how she89and Watkins used to talk about the flowers that were in bloom , and for an instant everything began to seem unreal again , almost as if it were a dream . He could not remember having dreamed about Pompey'sHead in years , not since those first months in New York when he used to wake up and not know where he was , but the configurationsof a dream could easily have taken on such a shape as this  --  the dining room of the Marlborough in the shadowy light of early morning , the Negro waiters in their accustomed uniforms , the rustle of the palm tree in the garden , and himself walking , almost as if in a trance , toward the table that Watkins used to save for him and Kit . It was one of the tables that stood along the line of windows , the fourth from the rear . A man drinking a glass of orange juice was sitting at the table in front of it , and two places farther along a second man was munching a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiters and Anson , they were the only persons in the room . It was very quiet . A sudden clatter of dishes rose and fell behind the door that led to the kitchen , and when it subsided there was nothing but the trickle of the fountain and the rustle of the palm tree and the quick bright call of a redbird . Anson recognized it immediately . It might have been only yesterday that he had last heard that cheerful call . He saw that the waiter was not going to show him to his old table after all . Going to the table in front of the man who was reading the Morning News , he pulled back the chair and waited for Anson to seat himself . The man glanced up from his paper with a grave , slow munching and then went back to his reading . Anson ordered orange juice , bacon and eggs , and coffee . After the waiter left , he again looked around the room . Everything was the same and nothing was the same . It was like returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changes they had made  --  it was the same house and the same rooms , and the clock in the hall had the same measured tick , but some of the furniture had been rearranged and the pictures were hung differently , and there was the lingering presence of alien shapes that made the house theirs , not yours . Not wanting to think about it , Anson opened the copy of the Histo.ricaI Guide . It began with several pages of advertisements and there were more advertisements toward the end . Leafing through them , he read about the Pompey 's Head Candy Company , specializing in benne brittle , a famous old Southern confection ; the Calico Lane Tea Shoppe , delicious lunch , afternoon tea , 12 to 3 and 3 to 6 ; the Pompey Arms , a Brinkler hotel , where you must be sure to serve90yourself from the Plantation Hunt Board in the Sportsmen 's Room ; the Jolly Jim Tire Company , finest recapping in the South ; and the Old Cottage Gift Shop , circa 1804 , glassware , pottery , and antiques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anson watched him until he flew away , and then leafed through the rest of the advertisements . He wondered how they would appear to him if he had never lived in Pompey 's Head , and if he might be tempted to serve himself from the Plantation Hunt Board and buy a box of benne brittle for Meg . Somehow he doubted it . He thought he would have sense enough to stay away from the Plantation Hunt Board , and he could not see himself getting out of a taxi with a box of benne brittle for Meg . " Typical , " she would say , " just typical , " and she would mean by typical , not only the benne brittle , which was a hard candy full of little , flavorful seeds , but all the vexing provincialisms she disliked about the South and which the box of candy would be sure to bring to mind . " All right , then ! " he said to her one night during the third year of their marriage . " If all these things are wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Because , darling , you caught me on the rebound , " Meg answered . " Jake Sundburg was leaving to head up the Rome bureau , and I expected him to ask me to marry him before he left , and when he did n't I started to console myself with you . Besides , if you 're a Southerner , you 're a lapsed one  --  not emancipated , lapsed , the way some Catholics are lapsed . It was that that made you interesting . You 'd left your church and were full of complications because of it , and I 'd never known a lapsed Southerner before . Besides , if you must know , you were so darned sweet . " Anson did not answer . This was the first he had heard of Meg 's coming to him on the rebound . It was fine of her to be so forthright about it , but he wished it had n't been necessary . He would have preferrednot to know that she had expected Jake Sundburg to marry her , and he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had . Meg noticed the expression on his face . " But , darling ! Do n't be silly . That was then , not now . Jake Sundburgand me would have never worked out . Every time he shows up at a party I wonder what it was that I ever thought I saw in that big , stupid , pompous Swede . I never was really in love with him , not the way I was with you  --  it was the Rome bureau I was in love with  --  but let 's suppose I was . Were n't you in love with that girl in Pompey 's Head ? Were n't you now ? If it 's our being each other 's first love you91want , which I will admit is a tender idea , you 'll have to go back and arrange things differently . Either you 'll have to get yourself born in Hillsdale , Indiana , which God forbid , or else get me born in Pornpey'sHead . God forbid that too . " What Meg said was true , of course . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he himself had been no less in love with Kit . He had not gone to Meg on the rebound , however . He was completely over Kit when he began to think seriously about Meg . It did not matter any longer , nor had it ever in any vital way , but he wished that that conversation had not picked this moment to come driftingback into his thoughts . He did not like to think that when he and Meg were married Jake Sundburg was lurking somewhere in the background . But that was being silly again . Everyone had a background , and in all backgrounds there were people , and who was he to say that Kit Robbins was not present in his background on that Sunday afternoon when he and Meg were married at John Duncan 's place on Long Island ? He had enough to be depressed about without going out of his way . " That old girl of yours , " he could hear Meg saying as she helped him pack . " Will you be seeing her ? You know , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you always keep saying that I ran away from her ? " He took the pile of shirts Meg was holding and put them into his suitcase . " I did n't run away from her and I wo n't be seeing her . She does n't live in Pompey 's Head any more . Did n't I tell you about the time I saw her in Chicago ? " " I do n't remember . Is she the one who wanted you to spend the night in Lake Forest ? " " Good lord , no ! " He could not imagine anything more fantastic than his spending the night with Kit Robbins anywhere . " That was Emily Duncan . Her father asked me to call her up and I was n't able to reach her until I got back to the hotel after five  --  " " Dear me , the way you explain . I sometimes wonder how judges manage to live as long as they do . What about neckties ? Do n't you have any new ones ? Most of these look pretty shabby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was saying  --  " " I heard you . ' What you were saying was that you would n't be seeingthat old girl of yours because you 've already seen her in Chicago . Why do n't you get yourself some bow ties ? I do n't think you 've ever worn one . " 92 " The chances are that I never will , either . And I did n't see that old girl of mine , as you keep on calling her , in Chicago . I was windowshoppingon Michigan Boulevard , hunting for something for Debby 's birthday , and then , in front of the window --  " " Look , darling . I 'm sure it was an interesting experience and somedayI want you to tell me all about it . Right now , though , you have forty minutes to catch your train . Are you sure you have everything ? What about your toothbrush ? " He was thinking about his encounter with Kit Robbins on MichiganBoulevard and Meg was thinking about his toothbrush . It seemed all out of balance , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meg . She had no feelings about her one way or the other because , as she said , it was hard to be interested in people you had never known . Whether or not he had his toothbrush was much more important . In any case , whatever else lay ahead of him , seeing Kit Robbins need not be one of his worries . Not that it would have made much difference . He was sifting only a few feet from where they used to have supper together , but Kit Robbins did not matter any longer . All that was in the past . It had started being in the past the day he and Meg were watching the skaters on the rink in Rockefeller Center , and it was completely in the past the day he saw Kit on Michigan Boulevard . " Why , Anson ! It 's you ! " " Oh , hello , Kit . What are you doing way out here ? " Kit was still beautiful , and with the structure of her face and frame she would continue to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the trouble and unhappiness might never have been . Everything was over . He had often wondered what it would be like to see Kit Robbins again , and now he knew . He could even tell himself , noticinghow the weak sunlight was being reflected in the windows of the Tribune Building , that Kit was hardly to blame . It had been too much for her , just as it had been too much for him , and Kit Robbins would never matter again . " You 're still living in New York , I hear . " " Yes , I am . And you ? " " Oh , I  --  we 're living in Oak Park . What brings you to Chicago ? " He was still living in New York and she was living in Oak Parkand all the hurt was gone . There should be more to show for all thatanguish than this meaningless conversation . It made what happened so completely a waste . And now , sitting in the dining room of the93Marlborough Hotel , it seemed more a waste than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and be that person again , and if it mattered so little why had it ever mattered so much ? " Excuse me , sir , " he heard the waiter say . " Here 's your orange juice . Drinking it , Anson leafed through the pages of the Historical Guide . he saw a picture of St. Paul 's Church , a photograph of the old courthouse near the waterfront , an etching of one of the squares , and a pencil sketch of the J. J. Lockhart home . " This private dwelling , " the guide said , " NW corner James and W. Hampton Sts. , erected in 1835 , is of early Classical Revival design . Strikingly designediron grillwork ornaments the Doric portico , the balcony , and the garden fence . The living rooms are magnificent with their mahoganysliding doors , dark marble mantels , and ornate plaster medallionson the ceiling . " It was an adequate description of the Lockhart house , except that it gave no idea of how oppressively sterile the place was  --  it was hard for him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had always been assumed that Joe Ann and Wyeth Blackford would marry each other , but it had not worked out that way . According to Marion , who now lived with her husband and three children in Denver , where Anson 's mother lived also , Joe Ann had grown tired of waiting for Wyeth to make up his mind and had married Jay Lockhart instead . That was about the last piece of news Anson had had from his sister about any of his old crowd . Denver was a long way off and Marion had cut her ties with Pompey 's Head as completely as he had cut his . When the waiter arrived with the rest of his breakfast , Anson saw that a helping of hominy had been served up with the bacon and eggs . It was incredible that he should have forgotten that you always had hominy for breakfast in Pompey 's Head . Or , rather , that you always had hominy . Eating his breakfast with relish , he continued to look through the Historical Guide . It was like coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drawer . Things were not quite as you remembered them , and it seemed that the photographs and not your memory must be at fault , and every now and then you were confronted with some puzzling detail that brought you up short . The Hanby house , for instance , which the guide said was now an antique shop  --  did it have curved sandstone steps at either end of its front stairway or did n't it ? The guide said it did , but he thought not . Gaby Carpenter 's house had steps like that , and so had the Johnsons ' , but the Hanbys '  - -  Suddenly it became as unimportant as it was . Turning the page , he saw a photograph of the Blackford home on the Cassava River . It barely resembled the shabby , run-down place he remembered , but even had the name " Mulberry " not been printed beneath the photographhe would have recognized it immediately . He had no idea , however , that it could be so handsome . This was the way it must have looked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blackfords to the high point of their wealth and power . He had a sudden desire to see it again ; all the old affection came rushing into his throat . But to whom in the world did it belong ? Not Wyeth , surely , becausewhen last heard of Wyeth was on the road selling ice cream in the two Carolinas . It was unlikely that he had sufficiently prosperedto afford such splendor , and it was equally unlikely that he had married anybody who could afford it for him . A piece of news as big as that would somehow have found its way to Marion , or if not Marion to his mother , and it would have been surely passed along to him . Who owned the place , though ? He turned to the guide to see if it told . There was a brief sketch of the Blackford family , which relatedhow Percy Wyeth Blackford had been Sir Samuel Alwyn 's second-in-command , and an explanation of how the property had received its name . " It was the hope of the original colonists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyeth Blackford set out a number of mulberry trees for the culture of silkworms  --  hence the name Mulberry . ' " All this , however , Anson knew . What he wanted to find out was to whom the place belonged . The guide gave no hint . The description concluded with a note that said the property was closed to visitors . Anson felt that a door had been quietly shut in his face . He always had the run of Mulberry , just as Wyeth Blackford had of the house on Alwyn Street , and even though Wyeth 's family had found it necessary to give it up before he left Pompey 's Head , he always thought of it as a second home . Some of his happiest hours had been spent at Mulberry . He loved the view of the river from the room in which he always slept , the mists that rolled in with morning and the lazy shadows of late afternoon , the honk of geese in the winter midnight and the thrushes deep in the summer woods , the festive occasions when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps of the porch and sang to the accompaniment of Vicksburg'sguitar  --  it was difficult to sort them out , so fast the memories94 95came , and it was hard to believe it was he who had figured in those almost forgotten scenes . He lit a cigarette , trying to bring the present into some sort of relationwith the past , the quiet of the morning gently invaded by the clock in the steeple of St. Paul 's Church tolling seven o'clock , when he heard a shuffle of footsteps along the bare wooden floor of the dining room . He turned to see who it was . The next moment he was on his feet and the sound of his voice was booming in his ears . " Watkins ! " He moved toward the old Negro through the awareness that the two other men who were having breakfast were watching him , that his voice was reverberating along the walls , and that the added weight of fifteen years was a burden Watkins could barely carry . A solid , heavy-set man in the old days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed to have to pull himself along , dragging his feet . His hair had turned into a white , curly fringe , and his features , once sharply defined , had grown fleshy and indistinct . He peered into Anson 's face earnestly , smiling in a bemused fashion , and then , slowly , as recognition came , his mouth widened into a big , delighted grin . He grasped Anson 's outstretched hand in a huge brown paw and pressed it warmly . " No , now ! It 's Mister Sonny . " He wagged his head and began to chuckle , still holding Anson 's hand . " Yes sir , it 's Mister Sonny for sure . Where you been , young man ? " " Away , Watkins , just away . " " Yes sir , it 's sure good to see you . You had your breakfast yet ? They been treating you right in here ? " " Fine , Watkins , fine . " The old Negro relinquished his hand and looked at him again , chuckling deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't changed a bit . I 'd of knowed you anywhere . Yes sir , anywhere I 'd of seen you , I 'd of knowed you . How you been ? " " Fine , Watkins , fine . And you ? " " I ca n't complain . I still get around . I do n't wait any more , though  --  they 've put me in charge of the gentlemen 's hats . Eight to two I 'm supposed to be on the job , but waking early like I do , five or six o'clock , I generally get here beforehand . What else do I have to do ? " He checked his garrulity and began to grin again . " Yes sir , I ca n't tell you how glad I am to see you . I was saying to Felicity the other night , not more than a week ago , Felicity , ' I was saying , I wonder what 's happened to Mister Sonny Page . ' " 96Anson knew it was purest fiction and that it was part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two races , but he was nonetheless grateful . He would just as soon believe that he had not been forgotten and that Watkins had wondered to Felicity about what had happened to Sonny Page . It was strange , however , to hear himself called Sonny again . It had not happened since he left Pompey 's Head . The name had been invented by Marion . It was based on the last syllable of his first name , as he used to think it necessary to explain because he did not want people to think it was the diminutive of " son , " and until the time he left for New York he had never been called anything else . He used to be Sonny Page , and now he was Anson Page , and somewhere along the line Sonny Page had disappeared . He could not place the time of thevanishing , nor say how it had come about , but he was not the person Watkins imagined . " You home for good now ? " " No , Watkins . Just for a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! When you coming back for good ? " " Someday maybe , Watkins . Maybe someday . " " You do that , young man . But do n't make it too long . Old Pornpey'sthe best . " For the moment Anson wished it were possible  --  nothing in the past could touch him any more and , given the chance , he would be tempted to risk it . But it was too impossible even to think about , and , besides , he was beginning to tire of this half-world in which he was moving . Duncan &; Company was not paying his expenses in order for him to talk to an old Negro about Pompey 's being the bestand when was he coming back and what had happened to Sonny Page . " Take care of yourself , Watkins . I 'll see you around . " " Yes sir ! And you take care too . Just wait until I tell Felicity that I saw you  --  it was only the other night that we were talking aboutwhere you 'd gone to . And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you . " " It 's good to see you too , Watkins . Give Felicity my love . " He did not know Felicity and would not have been able to remember her name . He had come home , however , and it seemed right to be sending Felicity his love. 97CHAPTER EIGHTA few minutes later , sitting on the edge of the bed with the Pompey 's Head telephone directory open in his lap , Anson decided that he would have to begin with Ian Garrick . He wished he did not have to , but there seemed no way out of it . He had to find a way of getting in touch with Mrs. Wales , and Ian appeared to be his only lead . It was his original intention to first get hold of Wyeth Blackford . He had imagined them having a drink somewhere , or walking in the woods , and Wyeth 's giving him what Mr. Barlowe would call the local background  --  who was living and who was dead , who had marriedand who had moved away , and eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction to Mrs. Wales . Wyeth 's name , however , was not listed in the directory  --  Black , Blackburn , Blackdell , Blacker , but no Blackford . That ancient and honorable name , woven into the history of Pompey 's Head from the very beginning , seemed to have been completely erased . Mrs. Blackford , as his mother had written him when he was stationed in London during the war , was dead . But Mr. Blackford ; was he dead too ? And Dinah ? What about her ? And what had happened to Joe Ann Williams , that sweet and happy girl ? He knew that Joe Ann had married Jay Lockhart  --  Mrs. J. J. Lockhart , Jr. , her name would be  --  but Jay 's name was nowhere in the directory . His mother 's was included , Mrs. J. J. Lockhart , Sr. , and from the address and telephone number ( 125 Hampton : Main 2-roo6 ) Anson knew that she was still living in the house described in the Historical Guide . It was quite possible that Joe Ann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady all alone in thatvast house could not readily be imagined  --  but if that were so it was strange that Jay 's name did not have a separate listing . Everything , however , would come straight in time . Ian Garrick could be depended upon to bring him up to date . The thought of seeing Ian , however , was no more congenial than before . He could not forget the morning when Ian had been unable to find a word for him . It was all in the past now , part of the lost , submerged world of Sonny Page , and if forgiveness was necessary the intervening years had made it easy to forgive  --  Ian , being Ian , could not have done otherwise . At the time , however , it had seemed a gross betrayal . The world had divided into two camps  --  friends and enemies  --  and Ian was not his friend . Nothing , however , was to be gained by dwelling on that . He had to find a way of getting to Mrs. Wales , and Ian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paxton . As he adjusted himself to the idea of seeing Ian , he began to find certain advantages in it . Ian was a lawyer , whom he could bring partially into his confidence and thus give a professional emphasis to his call  --  there could even be a fee , if need be  --  and Olive , whom Ian had married , was distantly related to Mrs. Wales . Together they might be helpful ; more helpful , actually , than Wyeth Blackford . Thumbing the pages of the telephone book , Anson looked up Ian 's home number . The exchange was unfamiliar to him ( Bullock 2-3639 ) and he had never heard of Azalea Drive . He reached for the telephone , thinking to call Ian immediately , and then decided against it . Ian himself he felt able to face . The mine fields had been laid and the years had built their own defenses . He had not engineered them , planning against a time when it might be necessary to meet Ian Garrick again , but he knew they were there . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; stronger ; bearing the scars of all the years he had spent in his cubbyhole at Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul  --  and he had confidence in his ability to carry off a meeting with Ian without any trouble . But Ian 's voice coming puzzled and disembodiedover the wire , taking several moments to comprehend who it was and then bursting out as though they were once again meeting on terms of an old , cherished intimacy  --  no , that he preferred to avoid . Better simply to walk to the offices of Garrick &; Leigh and announce his presence . There would be even a certain value in taking Ian by surprise . He would have no time to arrange the scenery for a sentimental meeting between two boyhood friends . Ian , however , would be at least another hour getting to his office. 98 99It was not yet eight o'clock , and the day 's business in Pompey 's Head rarely began until around half-past nine . What to do with himself until then ? He thought of taking a walk and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down Alwyn Street and see their old house , but that was the one encounter for which he was not prepared . There was no way in the world he could keep himself from being hurt . Not yet , however . For the moment he lacked the courage . Rising from the bed , he picked up his briefcase and carried it to a desk that stood near one of the windows  --  it would be well , while there was still time , to review all the facts he had been able to acquire relative to the affair of Phillip Greene and Garvin Wales . First , though , he wanted a drink of water . He went into the bathroom , a high-ceilinged chamber with a marble-topped washbasin and an immense tub that stood several inches off the floor , supported by cast-iron legs fashioned to resemble lion 's paws , and let the cold water run into the basin . One thing about the Marlborough , he told himself  --  whatever it might lack in the way of chintz , imitation maple , and framed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up here , you would not have to wonder where you were ; you would not have to think twice to know you were not in Sioux City . The room into which he looked from the bath was three times as large as any hotel bedroom he had ever seen . The old-fashioned furniture matched its proportions . There was a double bed , a dresser , a wooden rocker , several chairs , a bedside table on which stood a reading lamp and the telephone , the desk by the window , a floor lamp near one of the chairs , and a high , massive cabinet , made of mahogany , that reminded him of a similar one that had stood in the second-floor hall of the house on Alwyn Street . He remembered how much of a problem it had been . Well as they knew their way , somebody was always running into it in the dark . His mother kept threatening to sell it , saying that they could get something useful with the money , and once went so far as to run a three-day advertisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , however , and they kept on colliding with the cabinet in the dark , bruising their elbows and barking their shins , and it stood there year after year until it took on almost a human presence , like some troublesome , trying member of the family whose presence everyone grudgingly had agreed to tolerate . Staying in a room in the Marlborough was going to be more of an experience than he had imagined . It had the anonymous characteriooof all hotel rooms , where last night 's lives are bundled up and sent out with this morning 's laundry , and yet , because it was the . Marlborough , it represented an overlooked corner that he was coming upon for the first time  --  never had it occurred to him that someday he would be staying at the Marlborough , or that he would be like any other transient who passed through Pompey 's Head . Not wanting to think about it any longer , he walked back into the bedroom and sat at the desk . Zipping open his briefcase , he saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillip Greene had sent to theaccounting department ; copies of Garvin Wales 's royalty reports showing the discrepancies of which Mrs. Wales had complained ; several sheets of ruled yellow paper covered with notes made forhis own guidance ; and , finally , the sixty-four canceled checks made out to Anna Jones , After ten days the name had taken on a certain fascination for Anson  --  who was this Anna Jones and what was her place in thepicture ? He remembered a conversation with Mr. Barlowe several days after the meeting in the offices of Duncan &; Company . He hadjust explained to Mr. Barlowe that he had asked one of the tracing agencies to find out what it could about Anna Jones . " We may turn up a lead , " he said . Mr. Barlowe looked at him for a moment before replying . " I thought you had your lead , " he said . " Is n't that Wales fellow lead enough ? It still boils down to a question of his authorization , does n't it ? Or have you turned up something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't . It seems to me , though , that if we knew exactly how Anna Jones fits into this puzzle -- - " " But for all practical purposes we do know , " Mr. Barlowe brokein . " We know that your friend Phillip Greene wrote out twenty thousand dollars ' worth of checks to her . What else is there ? Heridentity ? Her present whereabouts ? " He took a cigar from the humidorthat stood on his desk and used it to make a short gesture of impatience . " I 'm afraid I do n't see their relevance . What 's the angle ? " " I do n't have any , " Anson replied . " I just thought that if we could find this Anna Jones and get a deposition  --  " " To what effect ? " Mr. Barlowe punctured his cigar and lit it , continuing to speak the meantime . " That Phillip Greene made thesedonations to her as an agent of Garvin Wales ? That 's what you 're rorthinking , is n't it ? All right  --  get such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do without supporting testimony from Wales ? This whole thing hinges on him , remember . Suppose he chooses to deny it ? " Anson permitted himself to shrug his shoulders . " In that event we 're sunk . But not any more sunk than we would be otherwise . If , that is , Wales is going to take the position that Phil Greene made those withdrawals without his knowledge and consent . Besides , as part of the background  --  " " That 's different . " Mr. Barlowe pulled in on his cigar and glanced at its tip . " If it 's background you 're after , well and good . But I would n't let my hopes soar too high if I were you . My own opinion is that even if you do manage to locate this Miss Jones , or Mrs. Jones , or whoever she is  --  you do n't expect me to believe that that is n't an assumed name , do you ?  --  you wo n't find her particularly obliging . Why should she be ? " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lent herself to a conspiracy . She had received money from Phillip Greene for twenty-one years and had managed to remain hidden throughout . So complete a concealment had to be deliberate . Yet , knowing this , he had thoughtlessly said that he thought a deposition might be had from her . " Put it down to my going off half cocked , " he said . " I had n't thought it all the way through . You 're probably correct in saying that it is foolish to imagine that this Anna Jones will talk , even if we brought her to court . And that 's impossible . I had another talk with Mr. Duncan yesterday . The one thing he insists upon is that we keep this from getting any publicity . He wants it to be handled quietly . " Mr. Barlowe shrugged his shoulders . " If that 's the way John wants it , that 's the way it has to be  --  he 's the one who foots the bills . I do n't know that I agree with him  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find themselves headed for court  --  but he may be right , considering the people involved . Frankly , they strike me as rather a messy lot  --  a man does n't slip a woman twenty thousand dollars under the barn door unless he is afraid to do it in the open . But tell me this . What 's made you so curious about Anna Jones ? If you 've put one of the agencies on the job , you must think it important to know more about her . Why ? " Anson was facing the window . After the spell of rainy weather , the morning was clear and fine . The sun shone on the waters of the bay just off the Battery and he could see all the way across to Brooklyn. rozThinking that New York had its points after all , he shifted his positionand said , " I 've already explained  --  I went off half cocked . It may be that I 'm going off half cocked all along the line . You 'll say that I 'm jumping to conclusions , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Garvin Wales who wanted that money sent to Anna Jones  --  I go along with Mr. Duncan and Van Bliss on that . " " Prejudice , " Mr. Barlowe said . " Rank prejudice . " " Of course it is , " Anson agreed . " But you yourself will admit that in a situation like this you have to have some point of departure and that you must begin with what you know . " " I would n't find any quarrel with that , " Mr. Barlowe replied . " But what is it , exactly , that you do know ? " " That Phillip Greene was an honest man , " Anson said . " Exactly how he became involved with this Anna Jones I ca n't imagine . As I see it , however , Mr. Duncan is absolutely correct in believing that he was acting on instructions from Wales , and that Wales knew about those withdrawals . It 's hard to believe that they would have been so carefully itemized on his royalty reports had it been otherwise  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were talking at lunch . " Mr. Barlowe shook his head . " Not at all . I agreed only that it was a plausible surmise , one arrangement of the few known facts . You could arrange them in several ways , as I went to some trouble to point out  --  it could be , for instance , that Wales regarded those various sums of money as loans . " " Yes , but --  " " Let me finish . John Duncan 's error  --  and yours too , if I may say so  --  is in assuming a relation between this Wales fellow and Anna Jones . But the established relation  --  the established one , I repeat ; not the theoretical one  --  is between Anna Jones and Greene . So far as the evidence indicates , there is no reason to suppose that Wales even knows of the woman 's existence . But let 's stop riding all over the track . You still have n't told me what caused you to become so curious about Anna Jones . " " Because I am , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not used to being addressed in such a fashion . His face lost its composed look and a glint of displeasure shadowed his eyes . Then , taking a puff on his cigar , and with his features arranged in their habitual expression , he said , " No , not at all . It so happens that I do n't like these steamy relationships . I have n't the stomach for them . If it were possible to get a deposition from Anna Jones to103the effect that Wales was aware of these payments and had authorizedyour friend Greene to make them  --  well , that would be one thing . But curiosity for the sake of curiosity , who the woman is , where she lives , what she may happen to look like  --  " He blew out a puff of smoke and waved it away . " No , I find that I 'm not at all interested . Why should I be ? " Mr. Barlowe looked friendly enough , and there was no apparent hostility in his attitude , but Anson was aware that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note in Mr. Barlowe 's voice that said very plainly that he thought Anson was implying that he was somehow at fault for not being curious about Anna Jones , and that it was up to Anson , now that he had brought it up , to show where the fault lay . It was little things like this that caused you to lose favor at Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul and get black marks beside your name . Anson knew that the thing to do was to frame his reply carefully and to mollify Mr. Barlowe 's ruffled feelings . There was a right thing to say and a right way to say it , but all of a sudden it did not seem worth the bother . He was tired of having always to edit his thoughts and he did not see why Mr. Barlowe 's feelingshad to be one of his major concerns . Looking across the desk behind which Mr. Barlowe sat waiting to hear why he should be curious about Anna Jones , he said : " I do n't suppose I gave your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as curious as I am . Greene I knew and Wales I know about . I now know about Mrs. Wales too , in a general sort of way , but Anna Jones is just a name . To me , though , she is just as important as the others . It troubles me to know so little about her . It is she who is at the bottom of this  --  that much is plain  --  and I wish she were less a mystery . I think that explains my curiosity . As for yours  --  well , perhaps it 's a little off its feed this morning . " It was a risk to end like that , much too forward and much too bold , but the look on Mr. Barlowe 's face told him that he had managed to say the right thing after all . He should have been pleased but he was not . He still did not like to think that whenever he talked with Mr. Barlowe he had to edit his thoughts . " Those checks that your friend Greene made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you had a good look at them ? " " No , not yet . Why ? " Mr. Barlowe considered his cigar for a moment . " If you intend to refer her to one of the agencies , you might find them helpful . I did n't look at all of them the day we went uptown , not more than104four or five , but the ones I happened to see appeared to indicate that she did a certain amount of moving around  --  at least two of them were cashed in different parts of the country . They might bear closer examination . I do n't give a damn about the woman , and I still say that even if you do turn her up you wo n't get anywhere , but I feel obliged to do what I can to help you satisfy this curiosity of yours . " It could have been a rebuke but it was not ; when Mr. Barlowe wanted to minister a rebuke he left no question . Anson quickly ran over what he had just said . That two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country might prove to be of no importance . The significant thing was that Mr. Barlowe , in the midst of that difficult session at Duncan &; Company , had observed the clearinghousestampings on their backs and instantly comprehended their possible value . Once again Anson was driven into a kind of grudging admiration . Mr. Barlowe was not the easiest man in the world to get along with , and Meg was probably right in saying that he had n't had a new idea in forty years , but that was beside the point . If you had to work for a living , there was always the problem of getting along with somebody , and Meg 's years on the newsmagazine sometimes led her into confusing the possession of ideas with intelligence . Let there be no mistake ; Charles Barlowe was nobody 's fool . " Thanks for the tip , " Anson said . " I 'll get to work on them right away . " Mr. Barlowe gave one of his well-bred grunts . " I would n't overdo it if I were you . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself this morning . Relax . It 'll all come out in the wash . " What , though ? It was what might come out in the wash that troubled Anson most of all . That night he went over the checks Phillip Greene had sent to Anna Jones . Meg had gone to a concert with one of the girls with whom she used to work and he was alone in the apartment with the children . He sat in his shirt sleeves in the small room he used as a study . The children were both asleep . After the shrill , romping confusion that always attended their bedtime , and Meg 's hurrying to get to the concert on time , the apartment seemed very quiet . One by one Anson examined the checks Phillip Greene had written , making notes on a sheet of ruled yellow paper . He wrote down the date on which each check had been issued , the amount of money it called for , and the place in which it had been cashed . It was not the kind of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was105absorbed in it  --  slowly , check by check , Anna Jones was acquiring something in the way of a personal history . She herself was shadowy as ever , identified only by a labored signature that would seem to indicate only the most rudimentary kind of schooling , but gradually , as he continued to add to his notes , a few facts about her began to emerge . It was more than two hours before Anson was through with the checks . He slipped a rubber band around them , put the bundle aside , and then considered his notes . Mr. Barlowe was correct  --  Anna Jones had done a certain amount of moving around . But not in the sense of traveling . What had actually happened , judging from the story told by the checks , was that she had lived , for varying lengths of time , in three parts of the country  --  Ransome , Alabama ; Detroit , Michigan ; and St. Louis , Missouri . So much was immediately clear . The checks themselves were a little more puzzling . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not until Anson spent another half hour with them , making more jottings on a new sheet of paper , that they grouped themselves into three informative sequences . The first check of the lot , drawn to the sum of $zoo , was dated September 6 , 1919 . It had been cashed eight days later , September 14 , in Ransome , Alabama , and bore the endorsement of two signatures  --  thatof Anna Jones and , below it , written in an equally uncomfortablehand , that of someone named Cleon Pyle , who apparently was the proprietor of a place called the Farmers Market . The check had been handled by the Ransome Bank &; Trust Company , as had fifteen others . On none of these did the signature of Cleon Pyle reappear . Trained though he was not to jump to conclusions , Anson felt it safe to surmise that Anna Jones was at that time relatively unfamiliar with checks and that , upon its arrival , she had taken it to be cashed at a place , most likely in her own neighborhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Cleon Pyle of the Farmers Market had obliged Anna Jones , and Anson wondered if he was still alive . The tracing agency had best get on his trail immediately . Going back to his notes , Anson saw that the fifteen other checks handled by the Ransome Bank &; Trust Company were each for $250 . They came to a total of $3,750 and covered a period of approximately six years . The date carried by the first in the series was January 2 , 1920 , and the last , September 2 , 1925 . Looking down his column of figures , Anson saw that Phillip Greene , during the twenty-one-year106period in question , had sent a check to Anna Jones three times a year at regularly established intervals : January 2 , May 2 , and September 2 . There were several checks mixed in for smaller amounts and one for $r , 000 dated June 12 , 1940 , but it was plain that Greene was carrying out what he regarded as a fixed obligation . " It 's a dismal thing , " Van Buren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Company , where Anson had gone to pick up the checks . " Damn it , Anson , unless we clear this up , sooner or later it 's bound to leak out . You know that as well as I do . There is more gossip in publishing than there is in a small town . " " You do n't know small towns , " Anson said . " The hell I do n't , " Bliss replied , biting on his pipe . " Did I ever tell you the name of the place I came from ? It 's Blackwing , Minnesota . Both my grandfathers were from the East . One was born in upper New York State and the other in Pennsylvania . They could n't make it where they were  --  not well enough to suit them , anyway  --  and when the big migration came along they went West with it . They were both doctors . One was a good doctor and the other was a drunk . A real one ; an honest-to-God belief . from way back . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " There was a girl in the BlackwingHigh School I thought I was in love with . Thought ? I 've never loved anyone half so much in my life . I was in my senior year then , and I nearly went crazy because her family would n't let her go out with me  --  in my day , and in Blackwing , Minnesota , families had that power . And why would n't they ? Because of my grandfather Bliss . They still remembered his bouts with the bottle and were afraid that the taint had been passed on to me . So do n't tell me I do n't know small towns ! " He paused for a moment and then continued : " But publishing , I say , is just as bad . It 's inbred as a can of worms . I 'm not worried about your talking , or Paul Tarbell , and I think I know enough to keep my mouth shut . The one I 'm afraid of is John . He 's going to take one drink too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those parties he goes to , and surer than hell he 'll blow his top . He 's worried about what a scandal will do to the firm , just as we all are , and he has a tremendous loyalty to Phil . But more than that , he hates Lucy Wales . I do n't mean dislike , or find distasteful , or have an aversion for ; I mean hate . " " Why ? " Van Buren Bliss shrugged his shoulders . " As my fourteen-year-old says , you tell me and we 'll both know . I think , however , that it in-107volves his idea of loyalty  --  that among a few other things . John is n't sentimental ; in some ways he can be hard as nails . He is generous , though , in that impulsive way of his , and if he happens to like you there is nothing he wo n't do . " Anson thought of that morning in the duck blind and of that other , later morning when John Duncan picked up the telephone and called Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . " " As John sees it , " Bliss continued , " he 's been unreservedly loyal to Garvin . This is n't for general publication , but there was a time when Garvin put the bite on him for sixteen thousand dollars . That was when he and Lucy decided they wanted that place in Jamaica . Garvin could n't afford it , actually . His last two books had n't been successful  --  The Stained-Glass Window sold less than seventy-five hundred copies  --  and he was pressed for cash . John did n't hesitate about advancing him that sixteen thousand . Phil was all for it too . Looking back , we can say it was the best investment we ever made  --  we got three best sellers from Garvin in a row , along with our share of the motion-picture money that came in from two of them , plus another cut when The Night Watch was made into a play . When John advanced that sixteen thousand , though , he did n't know this would happen . Sure , he was gambling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , with Garvin seeming to be at the end of his rope , just as he is now , sixteen grand was a lot of money to lay on the line . " The more Anson learned about publishing , the more baffling it became . No wonder Mr. Barlowe said that he would n't give desk room to any of those literary fellows and that he did n't see how they kept themselves alive . " But where does Mrs. Wales fit in ? " he asked . " You started to explain why John has such strong feelings about her . " Van Buren Bliss found that his pipe had gone out . Striking one of the kitchen matches he carried , he puffed a few times and said , " John is a feeling man . He feels that Lucy ought to be loyal too  --  it may be unreasonable of him , but he does . He also feels that he 's been stabbed in the back . And that it was Lucy makes it all the worse . Garvin 's real tie here was Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Phil who kept him going . I mean that , literally . " A new tone had come into Bliss 's voice , bearing a trace of solem- nity . No one at Duncan &; Company ever seemed able to discuss the friendship between Garvin Wales and Phillip Greene without becom- ing almost reverent . It was something Mr. Barlowe would not have understood , and Anson was not sure he understood it either . Having himself been devoted to Greene , he was not disinclined to sentiment . It did seem to him , however , that the relation between Greene and Wales had been elevated beyond the human plane to the point of sanctification and that , like one of those brittle relics to be seen under glass in the churches of Europe , it had become Duncan &; Company 's holiest possession  --  it would not surprise him , he once told Meg , if one day , walking up Madison Avenue , he found John Duncan at the head of a solemn , slow-moving procession in which papier-macho images of Phillip Greene and Garvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being carried down the street . " And you would be right in there with them , " Meg had replied . " You 'd be one of the ones holdingup Phil Greene . " Van Buren Bliss was still on the subject . " It might have been possible for Garvin to bring it off without Phil 's help , but I frankly do n't think so . If ever you read their correspondence , you 'll see what I mean . One of the few sympathetic things about Garvin  --  he 's a pretty thorny character , you might as well know  --  is that he does n't think he 's worth a damn . He never has . Time after time he 's threatened to chuck it . " " Who has n't ? What does that prove ? " " Nothing , probably . Unless , as Phil thought , there is a certain kind of humility involved . Writing is a queer business and writers are queer birds . Egocentricity is their principal stock in trade  --  that and a consciousness of their own genius . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days when I 've wished I never left the farm , but with anything less a writer can hardly continue . Either he is self-absorbed to the point of neurasthenia or he ca n't stand the gaff . Look at me . I know . I 'm one of those who were shaken from the branch . The publishing offices and the universities are full of me and my kind . " " And Wales ? " Bliss collected his thoughts for a moment . " With Garvin it 's the same . He would n't be a writer if it was n't . According to Phil , though , he has no real belief in his talent . He does n't think that what he has to say is important simply because he is saying it , and he has no dependableconfidence in his ability to put it down . And yet , because he is a writer , more completely possessed than any man I know , he 's caught , wholly and absolutely  --  all he can do is suffer . " " You make it sound pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garvin it is grim  --  more grim than anyone prob- ably knows . There is not much sweetness and light to that man ; do n't expect to find somebody out of Puss in Boots . Being alive is a real torment for him , and it was Phil who made it bearable  --  if you think I 'm exaggerating , wait till you read their letters . Garvin thought he depended upon Phil for editorial advice , of which he received plenty , God knows , but what Phil really gave him was the will to persist . If it had n't been for Phil , always standing behind him , always encouraging , always willing to live through those suicidal moods that Garvin can work himself into  --  well , I do n't know . It 's an extravagant thing to say , but I sometimes have the feeling that it was Phil who kept him alive  --  what 's going to happen to him now that he 's blind and does n't have Phil to depend upon any longer , I do n't like to think . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went off into his own thoughts for a few moments and then , rousing himself , said , " But it 's John and Lucy we were talking about , were n't we ? That part of it is simple  --  simpler than Phil and Garvin , anyway . John and Lucy belong in the same social bracket and they had a lot in common . Lucy liked partying on Long Island with the Duncans and the Duncans liked visiting Lucy in all those out-of-the-way places that she and Garvin picked out to live . " John and Garvin got along  --  no , let 's be fair ; it was more than that ; a genuine friendship was involved  --  but the important con- nection there was between John and Lucy . She 's not much younger than John , just by ten years or so , and she is , or was , a beautiful woman  --  it 's been so long since I 've seen her that I ca n't rightly say . Anyway , John was attracted to her . How much attracted , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to have her picture on the wall of his office . It hung there for years . Not , mind you , that I am implying there was anything between them  --  I do n't think there was ; I 'm simply saying that John was attracted . He made no bones about it , and the bones naturally showed . And if it is a purely physical hold that Lucy has on Garvin , as he now likes to say , I venture the proposition that it is one which he was once quite able to under- stand . " " Is that her only hold ? " " Only ? " Van Buren Bliss gave a derogatory shrug . " Is there such a thing as an only , even in this Freudian age ? That she has some particularly strong hold on Garvin seems to be agreed upon by every- one . What it is , however , I 'm in no position to say . The truth of the matter is that I am handicapped in talking about Garvin , since I was never part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to is Julian Tokar . If you want to know about Garvin , more than John or I or anybody else can tell you , he 's your man . You know who he is , do n't you ? " " By reputation , yes . Who does n't ? " " Julian , as you have undoubtedly heard , was Garvin 's lawyer for years . There was a break there too , though , and Lucy sent him packing . It seems to happen to everybody . But next to Phil , Julian was closer to Garvin than anyone else . I think you ought to talk to him . As a matter of fact , I 'm having a drink with him this afternoon around five and I halfway promised to bring you along . " " I wo n't be breaking in ? " " Of course not . Julian will be glad to meet you , and he will be even gladder to talk about Garvin  --  the truth is that Garvin is a kind of obsession with him . You 'll probably get tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was trying to say about Lucy and John . " " Yes , please do . " " Well , John , as I say , now feels that he has been stabbed in the back , and by a woman he might have once had boyish notions about going to bed with . So the wound is doubly deep . When he calls Lucy a bitch , it 's not only because he feels she has been disloyal to the house by bringing this charge against Phil . That 's why he 's sure to blow off about it before long , and , when he does , Phil 's name is bound to come into it . John will be half tight to begin with , and he will try to explain the details to a crowd of bored people who will only half listen , and talk will follow talk , and by the time it gets up and down Madison Avenue a few times Phil Greene will have been shacked up for twenty-one years with a woman named Anna Jones . " Anson put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his notes . No matter what thread was picked up , it led always in the end to Anna Jones . More and more her importance asserted itself , and the only information he had about her was what could be deduced from Phil Greene 's checks . A few things , however , had made themselves clear . From September 1919 through September1925 , Anna Jones had lived in Ransome , Alabama . It was logical to suppose that she had made Ransome her residence for some time prior to 1919 , but there was no evidence on that score . It could only be guessed at , not proved . But what else did he know ? 110 111Only that Anna Jones had taken her first check to a place called the Farmers Market , which was owned by someone named Cleon Pyle , and that she had herself cashed the other fifteen checks she received during that period at the Ransome Bank &; Trust Company . Hers , on these , was the only endorsement . It was not much to go on  --  hardly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil 's checks had caused some slight alteration in the manner in which Anna Jones handled her financial affairs . He knew nothing about Ransome , Alabama , other than that the latest atlas said it was a town of 2,657 people , but he suspected that during the years 1919 -- 25 it was a place where $250 represented a considerable amount of money . Phil 's first check had been for $ioo . Cleon Pyle of the Farmers Market could apparently oblige to that extent , particularly if part of the money had gone to wipe out a bill . However , when the second check arrived , calling for a payment of $250 , it was seemingly more than Cleon could manage . Anna Jones had to go to the Ransome Bank &; Trust Company and present it for payment herself . Ransome , Alabama . Anson had never been there but he thought he knew how it was . There would be a main street , widening into a macadam highway on both ends of town , and all the business establishmentswould be gathered into a single block  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neon sign that said EAT suspended above the sidewalk , the dry-goods emporium , the drugstoreon the corner , and , on the opposite corner , the two-story buildingthat housed the bank . The dentist and doctor would have their offices above the drugstore , their names printed on the windows in gilt block letters and perhaps under that of the dentist the single word PAINLESS , and the windows above the bank would also be lettered , though not necessarily in gilt , for behind these would be the narrow , whitewashed rooms , smelling of dust and summer , where the town 's lawyers saw their clients and prepared themselves against the coming sessions in the courthouse whose red brick tower was the most noticeable landmark for miles around  --  and somewhere , over twenty years ago , receiving three checks a year from Phillip Greene and taking them to the bank with such regularity that it must have been commented upon ( people being people and this being Ransome , Alabama ) , the shadowy figure of Anna Jones . The tracing agency should be instructed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would still remember who she was . Anson went back to his notes . The Ransome , Alabama , phase ofAnna Jones 's life had seemingly ended sometime after September 1925 . The next check she received from Phillip Greene , dated January2 , 1926 , and bearing the cramped signature which by now he would recognize anywhere , had been presented either for payment or deposit at a branch office of the National Bank of Detroit . Once Anna Jones was in Detroit , Anson lost her completely . He could imagine her in Ransome  --  walking down Main Street ; stopping to look at the dresses in the windows of the dry-goods emporium ; having a coke in the drugstore ; keeping her eyes fixed rigidly ahead as she passed within range of the stares that were turned her way by the idlers in the barbershop  --  but , once in Detroit , she was swallowed by the crowd . Was that why she had gone to Detroit  --  because of the crowd ? To be less solitary , less noticed , less marked ? Had Phillip Greene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had there been talk , gossip , scandal ? And why Detroit ? To work as a waitress ; to find employment in one of the automobile plants ; to live for a time with some friend or relative ? There was no way of knowing . All he had to go on were Phil Greene 's checks and on this score they told nothing . Anna Jones lived in Detroit for four years , from 1926 through 1929 . During that time she received fourteen checks from Phil Greene , twelve for the usual three-times-a-year sum of $250 , another for $loo , and another for $450 . The whole amount came to $3,550 . Then , toward the latter part of 1929 , she moved again . This time she went to St. Louis . She was still living there when , on June 12 , 1940 , the trail ran out . On that date she deposited the last check she received from Greene . It was the largest of the lot . It called for a payment of $1,000 and had gone through the channels of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IIad Anna Jones run into some sudden emergency , or had the $1,000 been in the nature of a final pay-off ? And why the change to St. Louis ? What had happened in Detroit ? What was it that kept Anna Jones on the move ? Restlessness ? Apprehension ? Fear ? And if fear , what kind of fear ? Who was she and how had her life become entangled with the lives of Garvin Wales and Phillip Greene ? Again there was no way of knowing . In St. Louis , Anna Jones seemed to have been able to settle down for at least eleven years . The third and last sequence of Greene 's checks extended over that period . The only other information to be gained from them was that during approximately ten of those years , from January 2 , 1930 , to September112 1132 , 1939 , the $250 which she had been getting three times a year was raised to $350 . There were thirty checks for this amount , coming to $10,500 . In addition to this , Greene had sent her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two others for $500 , and the big one for $i , 000 . The dates borne by these were fairly close together  --  February 5 , March 16 , April 12 , and June 12 . Four checks in four months ; $2,100 in all . There was no question that something out of the ordinary had happened . But what ? Some mad extravagance that had to be paid for ? A serious operation ? It was no use even trying to imagine . The checks led to their usual blank wall . The only thing of which he was certain was that no blackmail was involved . A woman does n't blackmail a man for twenty-one years and then let her victim off the hook . Nor does she disappear . Why , then , had Anna Jones disappeared ? Where had she gone and where was she now ? He could spare himself the trouble of trying to guess . Everything the checks had to tell was told already , and what they told , simply , was that it looked bad for Phillip Greene . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not find him guilty . He had withdrawn twenty thousand dollars from Wales 's account , there was no evidence that he had been authorized to do so , and he had written twenty thousand dollars ' worth of checks to a woman named Anna Jones . There was one way , though , of cutting through this fog . All that was needed was a statement from Garvin Wales . Let him declare that the withdrawals had been made according to his instructions , and they would have nothing to worry about . It was as simple as that. 114CHAPTER NINEIt was actually too simple . A good position was one that could be defended in depth and maintained all along the line . Here it was vulnerable at every point , with no reserve strength anywhere and the whole outcome depending on Garvin Wales . Swayed by John Duncan , Anson had never doubted that Wales would come to the aid of his friend . He was prepared to believe , also , that Wales knew nothing of his wife 's letter and that , as John Duncan kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was brought before him , that Phillip Greene had acted with his knowledge and according to his instructions . That , however , was before his conversation with Julian Tokar . It now seemed that John Duncan could be wrong . The possibility had to be faced that Garvin Wales might decline to co-operate and that , instead of coming to Phillip Greene 's defense , he might lend his testimony to support his wife 's charges . In which case Anson preferred not to think about it . Phillip Greene would go down as a thief . Mr. Barlowe was already more than half convinced that he was guilty , and should Wales profess ignorance of the matter , or join in his wife 's denunciation , John Duncan would also be compelled to question Greene 's innocence . So would the others ; there would always be that cloud . Furthermore , as Van Buren Bliss had said , they could not keep it from leaking out . Mrs. Wales herself , should Julian Tokar 's estimate of her character be correct , would do all the damage possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are dealing with a woman , " Tokar said . " You happen to be dealing with evil in its most absolute form . " Anson , sitting in the quiet of his apartment , felt the same distaste he had felt at the time . That piece of melodrama had best be for-115gotten entirely . It was he who would have to deal with Mrs. Wales  --  not Julian Tokar ; not John Duncan  --  and he would be placing himselfunder a needless handicap by accepting these outside judgments at face value . And yet -- And yet nothing ! He did n't want to think about it any longer and he wished Meg would come home . That concert should be over by now . Tired of sitting in one position , he put his notes aside and rose from the table at which he had been working . It was a wooden table of the kind that people used to have in their kitchens before the advent of the porcelain age . Meg had picked it up in a secondhand furniture store on Third Avenue . They used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but since neither he nor Meg was the sort of person who found any pleasure in doing things over , it still wore the dingy coat of apple-green paint that had been applied by some previous , more ambitious owner . The room was not big enough to contain much else  --  an unpainted wooden chair that Meg bought when she bought the table ; another and more comfortable chair that used to be in the living room before Meg decided it was getting too shabby to live with ; a standing lamp with an inverted bulb that reflected its light from the ceiling ; and , in one corner , a metal filing cabinet that Meg had also found on Third Avenue and had been unable to resist because it was such a bargain . Anson had nothing to put in it except some copies of his university 's law review and the small , flat albums in which he had pasted up the columns of historical jottings he had contributed to the Pompey 's Head Morning News , but the metal cabinet had proved of considerable value as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkbook stubs , bundles of the Christmas cards that came every year , and various other odds and ends . That room of his , Meg said , was a mess . He found it hard not to agree with her , but he was unable to agree that what they ought to do was to save enough money and have it done over into a real den . Eugene Hollister had a den in his house in Larchmont , and a den was the one thing Anson was sure he could do without . A den and a plumcoloredsmoking jacket . The last time they had driven out to the Hollisters ' for dinner , Eugene had appeared in a plum-colored smokingjacket and Anson was afraid he had not been able to conceal how dumfounded he was . " Who let you out in that ? " he asked . It was said before he realized it and immediately he wished he had thought about it beforehand . Eugene took it the way it was116intended , but Grace Hollister , who did not like him anyway , gave him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off badly . On the way home in the car Meg said that it was trying enough to have to see the Hollisters even under the best of circumstances , and why he had to make a crack like that the moment he stepped into the door was more than she could understand . She was n't angry , though , and even giggled a little . " The look on the poor man 's face , " she said . " Who do you think he was trying to impress ? " " Nobody , " Anson replied . " Gene 's all right . He just thinks he has to live up to your friend Charles Barlowe and his idea of how a bright young lawyer should look . It 's the junior esquire in him coming out . " " I 'm glad you 're not a junior esquire , " Meg said , sliding closer on the front seat . " Give me a kiss . " Meg was inclined to regard the Hollisters more severely than he . The world of Eugene Hollister was not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least it provided Eugene with the illusion of having a place . That was more than he could say for himself . There were times when he felt that he did not belong anywhere , and this was one of the times . He had not felt that he belonged anywhere since he left Pompey 's Head . Nor could it be said that he had failed with his group . He had no group . Sometimes he wondered if anyone in New York had . There were circles and cliques in New York , people drawn together by the same profession or a loose collection of momentarily shared interests , as in the case of Meg and the other mothers who belonged to the Parents Club that Boojum and Beejum read papers to , but these were temporary associations at best . The interests were always changing , and the faces with them , and there was always the feeling that everybody you met in New York was just passing through , or else on an extended visit , so that there were times when you had the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endlessgame of musical chairs . Phillip Greene once remarked to him that although New York was a collection of neighborhoods it was a place where nobody had any neighbors . " Some people say that this is one of the fine things about the city , but I do n't think so , " Greene went on . " A man wants neighbors . He may want to put a fence between himself and them , but he wants them just the same . The trouble with New York is that it imposes a set of unnatural conditions . Nobody knows anybody , even when they live next door to each other . You can make117 your home here for fifty years and still feel a stranger . I know I do . " Though Anson was barely acquainted with Phillip Greene at the time , he was surprised to hear him voice a set of feelings that were so close to his own . Greene was one of the people whom he had imagined as being completely at home in New York . It was that conversation which marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of Phillip Greene without recalling it . The time was October 12 , i936  --  bad though he was at remember- ing dates , he would always remember that one . He had just passed his twenty-sixth birthday and survived his first ten months at Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul . It was a Monday . He remembered it was a Monday because Mr. Barlowe , the previous Friday , had sent for him shortly after lunch . It was only the fourth or fifth time he had been in Mr. Barlowe 's office and he was nervous and ill at ease . Mr. Barlowe was signing his mail . He lifted his eyes when Anson entered , said " Oh yes , Page  --  I ' 11 be with you in a minute " in that preoccupied way of his , and left Anson standing there while he affixed his signature to the rest of the letters before him . He put down his pen and picked up what looked like a box of typewriter paper . " This thing just came down from Duncan &; Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those novels they publish . John Duncan had me on the telephone about it , but I did n't get all he said . I gathered , though , that it 's a question of possible libel . Duncan tells me that it 's based on the life of one of those hillbilly politicians they have down South and he wants to be sure they wo n't be in for a suit . He 'd like to have an opinion not later than Monday noon . Do you think you know enough to handle it ? " Anson was sure he knew enough , but it would not do to say so out loud . Mr. Barlowe would expect a more tempered reply . His heart missed a beat and he told himself that here was his big chance . He was then still too new to understand that in a firm like Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul there was no such thing as a big chance and that your whole future depended upon the skill with which you handled a number of routine chances that were deliberately thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had a record and everything went into your record , and it was your record , at the end of a year 's time , that decided whether or not you cleaned out your desk . " We school them , " Mr. Barlowe once said , " and then we see how they take their jumps . " Later , looking backward , Anson realized that his period of schooling had come to an end , and that Mr. Bar- 118 lowe had decided it was time for him to show how he took his jumps . It was just as well that he did not know it at the time . He would have been more nervous than he was . Even so , his thinking that this was his big chance caused him to take longer to answer than Mr. Barlowe considered necessary . " Well , " Mr. Barlowe said . " Do you ? " " Yes sir . I think so . " " Good . I 'm going to drop the whole thing in your lap . Mrs. Barloweand I are going down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back until Tuesday . You 'll have to handle it direct  --  John Duncan knows you 're going to . The man you 're to see up there is a fellow named Phillip Greene . Everything straight ? " " Yes sir . I think so . " " And , Page . " " Yes sir ? " " You need n't be so damned judicious . It 's not going to hurt you to speak up . " " Yes sir . I 'll remember . " It embarrassed Anson to think that he had once been so gawkish in Mr. Barlowe 's presence that he had to be told to speak up , and it was only slightly less embarrassing to remember how anxious he was not to miss his big chance . Nowadays , with his acquired skill , he would be able to go through a manuscript of that length in an evening ; then it took him the whole week end . He went over the manuscriptword by word , accumulating mountains of notes , and then pecked out a long opinion on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly midnight on Sunday before he was through . He was then living in a one-room apartment in Waverly Place , just off Washington Square , and somebody was having a party on the floor above . He could hear voices and laughter , and above them a phonographplaying , and now that his mind was no longer occupied , he wished he had a party to go to  --  he also wished he had a girl . But over and above everything , even his wish for a girl , was his determination to succeed with the assignment that had been given him . His whole future seemed to be hanging in the balance and he had to make a good impression on Phillip Greene . In Greene 's office the following morning , however , just before the lunch hour , his labors of the week end appeared to have been wasted . Phillip Greene barely looked at the report , which Anson had asked one of the girls in the office to retype . " I told John he had119nothing to worry about , " Greene said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You should n't have taken so much trouble . " Anson tried not to show his disappointment . It would have been hard for him to say what he had expected , but he had hoped for more . Phillip Greene , who had been standing when Anson entered his office , and who had remained standing throughout , dropped the report on his desk . Anson knew his reputation as a great editor , but he certainly did n't look like one . Nor had he ever seen such a small , cluttered , disorderly office ; you would think that a great editor would be able to do better than a room that was n't much larger than his own office down at Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul . As he stood waiting to be dismissed , Greene , looking at him steadily , said : " What did you think of it ? Did you like it ? " Anson stared at him dumbly . " Did I like what ? " " The novel . You 're from the South , are n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been asked to give his opinion of a manuscript before and he was not sure if it was expected of him now . The promotionhad been too sudden . A moment before he had been a young man from Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul , hardly more than a messenger boy if the truth be known , and now , without any warning , he was being asked to tell what he thought about a novel . Something , however , had to be done  --  he and Phillip Greene could not stand there looking at each other forever . " Why , yes sir . I suppose so . " " Suppose ? " Greene 's eyes did not move . " Do n't you know ? What was wrong ? " " Nothing , I guess . " " You guess ? Something was wrong then . What was it ? What did n't you like ? " This was as bad as a session with Mr. Barlowe , Anson thought . In some ways it was even worse . Mr. Barlowe did n't mind coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up that you could hardly think straight , but he never became this worked up and intense . " Well , " he said , " I do n't want to be critical --  " He paused , hoping to hear Phillip Greene say that that was what was expected of him , to go ahead and be critical , but Greene plainlyhad no intention of obliging . Forcing himself to continue , he said : " Well , that part where the hero , the politician  --  I suppose you'd120call him the hero  --  that part where he has dinner in the home of the girl --  " " Yes ? " " It would n't happen . " Phillip Greene 's face took on a different expression . His eyes widened as if with surprise , and then , narrowing , became more sharply piercing than before . He leaned forward , craning his neck a little , and said : " It would n't happen ? " " No sir . " Anson shook his head . " The girl 's family would n't have it . Not then . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor , although they might , but before that , right in the midst of the campaign , when he 's still this country redneck  --  well , if they are the kind of people the author says they are , that snobbish , they would n't have him in their house . They 'd think up some excuse . It would n't happen , that 's all . " Phillip Greene stood motionless , still with his neck craned forward , and then nodded gravely . " You 're right , " he said , speaking in a low , intimate tone for which Anson was hardly prepared . " It would n't . That 's one of the things the author will have to change . It did n't seem right to me , either . It did n't sound right . I 'm glad to know you agree . " They stood facing each other . After his brief venture into friendliness , which Anson thought he might already be regretting , Greene seemed to have rushed back to the recesses of his own secret world , locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees and judges a man in an instant , taking in the shape of his features , the hang of his body , and the flavor of his personality all at once , and Anson was always to remember Phillip Greene as he appeared at that moment , his tired blue eyes shining with a kind of repressed intensity , and his whole person giving off an impression of solitariness that set him apart from other men . A truly private person , Anson thought . A good man , surely . " But you liked the book , " Greene said doggedly . " You did , did n't you ? " " Yes sir , I liked it . " " And you thought it was good ? " " Yes sir , I thought so . Some parts I liked better than others --  " " Some parts ? " Greene 's eyes narrowed again . " What seemed to be wrong , other than what you 've said about the girl 's family , I mean ? If you did n't like it all --  " 121Anson was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had not said he did n't like it all , when John Duncan stepped into Greene 's office . He wore a pair of gray slacks and a rust-colored tweed coat and carried a bundle of proof sheets . Except for the proof sheets , he looked as ' though he might be on his way to the Cassava Gun Club . He said , " Hello , Phil . Hello , Anson , " speaking in the hearty , outdoor tone he sometimes affected , and then , addressing Anson directly , added , " They told me at your office that I 'd find you here . Is it all right for us to publish that book ? We wo n't get sued ? " " No sir , Mr. Duncan , " Anson said . " You wo n't get sued . It 's a good book . I enjoyed reading it . " " You hear that , Phil ? " Phillip Greene nodded and , much to Anson 's surprise , sat down at his desk . John Duncan gave no sign of finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " But that 's not all I wanted to talk to you about . Mrs. Duncan just called me on the telephone . She wants to know if you can join us for dinner and the theater tonight . " " Why , yes sir . I 'll be glad to . " " Fine . I was afraid you might not be free . Mrs. Duncan has some fluff of a thing on her hands , the daughter of a college chum of hers , and she finds herself in need of a young man . But not just any young man . I was given specific instructions to get hold of you . " They might not have been there so far as Phillip Greene was concerned . He was absorbed in a manuscript . Trying to match John Duncan 's matter-of-fact air , Anson said : " I 'll have to remember to thank Mrs. Duncan . What time , sir ? " It was plain that this was something that had come up all of a sudden and that John Duncan had not been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said : " Since Mrs. Duncan has tickets for the theater , we 'd better get an early start . We 're staying in town this week , so why do n't you meet us at our place around seven ? That ought to give us time . There 's one other thing , though . " " Yes sir . " " Mrs. Duncan wants to know if you 'd mind picking the lady up ? " Like any other young man of twenty-six , Anson had certain reservationsabout picking up girls he had never seen . " No sir , " he said . " I do n't mind . " John Duncan looked at him and gave a knowing grunt . " There is n't much you could do about it , even if you did , is there ? This is122what you get for making such a good impression on my wife . Anyway , the young lady is named Margaret Whitman and she has an apartment somewhere on East Forty-eighth Street  --  I 'll give you her address later . Mrs. Duncan tells me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exceptionally pretty  --  remember , though , that that 's my wife 's opinion , not mine . I would n't want you to hold anything against me . " " I wo n't , sir . " Anson liked seeing John Duncan . In all of New York he was his only tie with Pompey 's Head and almost his only friend . At least they shared a few memories together  --  the Cassava Gun Club , the smell of the marshes , the way the ducks came over just after light . " These proofs of Bob 's , " John Duncan said , turning to Phillip Greene . " Have you seen them ? Has he any idea of how much resettingis involved ? " Greene slowly looked up from the manuscript he was reading . " It 's all right , " he said in what Anson thought was a bored , almost annoyed tone . " It 'll be a better book . " " But why ca n't he better his books in manuscript ? " John Duncan demanded . " Why does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pained look crossed Phillip Greene 's face . " It 's his way , John . You ca n't interfere with an author 's way . " There it was , Anson often thought later ; there was the reason for the loyalty and devotion with which Phil was rewarded ; you could not interfere with an author 's way . But that was later , after a friendshipof almost fourteen years ; it was not the forenoon of October 12 , 1936 , with an unknowing young man reporting to Duncan &; Company on instructions from Mr. Barlowe and listening to a conversation he did not altogether understand . He could tell , though , that John Duncan did not think much of what Phillip Greene had just said . John Duncan started to reply , decided against it , and went on wrestling with whatever it was that bothered him . " All right , all right ! " he said finally . " Far be it from me to interfere with an author 's way ! These changes will bring him way over his allotment , but I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't interfere with an author 's way ! Come on , Anson . I 'll see if I can find that girl 's address . " Anson followed him to his office , which , unlike Phillip Greene 's , looked the way it should look , and waited until John Duncan found the address for which he was searching . It was written on the back of an envelope which he uncovered beneath a sheaf of letters that were123apparently waiting to be answered . Since Mr. Barlowe always cleaned up his mail before eleven o'clock , Anson was surprised to see them there . It was obvious that things were arranged differently uptown , and that the procedure at Duncan &; Company was not the same procedurethat applied at Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul . " See you tonight around seven , then , " John Duncan said , handing the envelope over . " Do n't dress . I 'm sorry I ca n't ask you to lunch . " " Oh , that 's all right , Mr. Duncan . I have to hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurry , and he had already planned to eat somewhere in the neighborhood , but he knew that John Duncanwas a busy , important man who could hardly be expected to ask him to lunch . It was nice of him just to mention it . He did not like the idea , though , of going to some drugstore alone . He had accepted the fact that his life in New York was going to be different from his life in Pompey 's Head , where there was never any question of finding someone with whom to pass the time of day , but even after nearly a year in New York the lack of companionship was still hard to get used to . Walking toward the elevator , he caught up with a slim , light-haired girl with a sensitive , well-bred face who nodded pleasantly as he went past . She was one of those young women whom he had come to associate with this part of New York , trim and confident and expensivelygroomed , and , nodding back , he thought how nice it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of Phillip Greene , who was waiting for the elevator with his thumbs hooked in the pockets of his vest , put all such notions out of his mind . It would n't do for it to get back downtown that he had gone to Duncan &; Company and tried to make a girl there in broad open daylight . Not that Phillip Greene gave any indication that he would have noticed . He gave off such an air of absent-mindedness that he seemed almost in a trance . He looked at the girl , who had ventured to call attention to her presenceby means of a faint , tentative smile , and then looked at Anson . " Hello , Mr. Greene , " Anson said . " I 'm just leaving . " Greene looked at him vacantly , still with his thumbs in the pockets of his vest , and Anson wished he had not spoken . He had not meant to be forward or to pretend that he and Phillip Greene were on friendly terms , and yet that was the way it probably sounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Greene and had been royally snubbed . Why did n't the man have the decency to say something , and why did n't that elevator come on down ? In the building on Fifth Avenue that the firm then occupied , the124offices of Duncan &; Company were serviced by a pair of small , grillworkelevators , on the order of iron baskets , from which you could see the swaying cables that dangled on both sides . The first car went by without stopping , giving off a wheezing , creaking sound , and the second dropped halfway past before its operator thought better of it and decided to return . He opened the doors with a loud " Down ! Down ! " a sullen-looking man with a flat , fleshy face and an untidy shock of thick gray hair , and Anson saw that the car was already crowded . The girl edged her way into it , causing the other passengers to shift their positions , and Anson waited for Phillip Greene to precede him . " You first , Mr. Greene , " Anson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without replying . " For chrisake ! " the operator said to Anson . " You think I got all day ! " He spoke under his breath , out of one corner of his mouth , but Anson was sure that everyone had heard . There were no two ways about it  --  this was the rudest , surliest , most ill-mannered town on the face of the earth , and that fellow ought to have his face slapped . He was the one to slap it for him , too ; one more unpleasant word out of him and he would get what he was asking for . Except , of course , that he knew he would n't . This was New York , not the Oasis in Bugtown , and a fine thing it would be if it got back to Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe and Paul that he had punched one of Duncan &; Company 's elevator operators in the nose . But one thing was certain . He could be as disagreeable as any of them ; if that 's what they wanted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , he failed to take into consideration  --  hewas still in the elevator . When finally it stopped  --  the operator banging the doors open and calling out " Ground floor ! Ground floor ! " as though he loathed the sight of it  --  Anson moved aside to make way for its women passengers . The girl who had got on just before Greene slipped past him with a lowered sidelong glance , and then , before he knew it , everyone was hurrying out ahead of him with the exception of Phillip Greene . It was largely his own fault , since he had managed to render himself more or less helpless by getting wedged in a corner behind the operator , but there he was , just as if he had never been in an elevator before , and there Greene was , staring at him in that bemused , exasperating way . There was nothing to do but admit defeat . " After you , Mr. Greene . " Considering how antagonistic he felt , he was surprised at how125meek he sounded . Greene looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second look , and stepped from the elevator . Walking into the busy corridor , he waited in a manner that Anson interpreted as an invitation to join him . He was anything but sure about it , however . More than half suspecting that he was falling into another booby trap , he said warily : " Yes , Mr. Greene ? " " That book we were talking about  --  " " Yes sir ? " " If you did n't like it all " " But I did n't say that , Mr. Greene . All I meant was that I liked some parts better than others . I liked the hunting and fishing parts especially . I thought they were fine . " Greene 's whole expression changed . " Yes , they are fine , are n't they ? " he said . " They 're full of the right feeling . And what you said before , about the girl 's family not having that fellow to dinner  --  that wo n't be hard for the author to change . It 's the only really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of that --  " It appeared at last to dawn upon him that this was no place for a quiet conversation . He looked around as if noticing his surroundings for the first time . He said , " I wonder --  " " Yes sir ? " " If you have nothing else to do  --  I mean , if we could find time to talk further about that book --  " Anson suddenly realized that he was being asked to lunch . It was not the usual sort of invitation , but he had already decided that Phillip Greene was not a usual sort of man . " I 'd like to , Mr. Greene , " he said . " I 'd like it fine . Where shall we go ? I 'm a stranger in this part of town , you know . " " I am too , " Greene said . " Everybody is . But there 's a place on Fifty-third Street --  " " It sounds fine , Mr. Greene . Thank you , sir . I was wondering what I was going to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty-third Street was a small Italian restaurant where Greene lunched regularly . There was room for only a dozen or so booths , along with a small bar , and the walls were covered with those homesick murals that Anson had come to accept as part of the standardequipment of all such establishments . These little restaurants always seemed very insubstantial to him , tied to New York by the slenderest kind of mooring , and he never went into one without126thinking that , if left to the pull of its own particular gravity , it would rise above the city and float back to whatever Italian town or village it was that the proprietor had come from . The present proprietor , a small , balding , voluble man in a shiny dinner jacket , hurried from his station behind the bar , which apparently he presided over , and showed Greene to his table . Greene , Anson noticed , seemed embarrassed by the effusiveness with which he was greeted ; he slipped into the booth almost furtively . " And to drink , gentlemen ? " the proprietor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This being a special occasion , Anson decided to have a cocktail before lunch . It was the first time be had broken his rule against it since coming to New York . By the time coffee came around he began to realize that , whether because of the cocktail , Greene 's questions , or the intimacy of his surroundings , he had done a considerable amount of talking about Pompey 's Head . There was not much he could do to remedy the situation , however , and he had just started telling the story of chief Tupichichi and his daughter Mary . " What then ? " Greene said . " What happened ? " Well , Anson said , this Indian girl , Mary , who was supposed to be quite beautiful  --  there was an old painting in the Pompey 's Head Historical Museum that was supposed to be a portrait of her , and for an Indian girl she was really quite attractive  --  this girl Mary , as he was saying , picked up English so readily that she became Sir Samuel Alwyn'sinterpreter . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though . The young men of the colony used to have foot races , and Mary always raced with them . With just a single outside garment and nothing underneath . She used to wrestle that way too . You would think that after all these years it would have stopped being a scandal , but it had not . Mary finally married one of the colonists , a man named Christian Bottomley . There were no longer any Bottomleys in Pompey 's Head , but there was a family named Carpenter that was descended from them , and he knew a girl , Gaby Carpenter , who to this day had to sort of apologize because of the way Mary used to race and wrestle . Actually , it was said that Christian Bottomley had to marry her . The story was that Sir Samuel , after one of those wrestling matches , personally saw to it that he did . Therc1 ' as no proof of that , though , absolutely none , and it just went to show how long a piece of gossip was remembered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anson often wondered how he could have been that young . There were times when he was tempted to tamper with127reality , and because it was so easy he sometimes did , seeing himself as more confident , more relaxed , more self-assured , but in the end he was always forced back to the truth . There was no way out of it  --  much as he would like to have it otherwise , he had been just that young . He did not think , however , that he had been objectionable . It was true that he had gone to Duncan &; Company wanting to make a good impression , feeling that his whole future was involved , but after the first few minutes at lunch he completely forgot it . He could tell that Greene did not care one way or the other about his being a representativeof Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul , and so , with that shift in emphasis , there was no reason for him to concentrate on putting his best foot forward . He honestly did not think he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him was that he had talked too much and that he must have seemed extremely young . " But how is it that you are so informed ? " Greene asked . " Do you have a special interest in history ? " " Yes sir , " Anson said . " I suppose you could call it that . Everybody down home has , in a family sort of way , and when you grow up hearingall those stories , like the one about Mary and Christian Bottomley , you find yourself wanting to know more about them . " Phillip Greene nodded . " Yes , I can see that you would . I used to hear stories too . None of them was as interesting as this Indian girl of yours , though . In my part of the country , they would n't be . Tell me  --  do you write ? " " Write ? " Anson said . " Me ? No sir . I 'm trying to be a lawyer . " For an instant Greene looked as though he wanted to smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this interest you have , this knowledge , I would have guessed that you had been tempted to try your hand at writing . It 's no vice , you know , even for a lawyer . " He again looked as though he wanted to smile . Anson , not liking to think he was being a source of amusement , said , " It all depends on what you mean by writing , Mr. Greene . I used to do a column for our local newspaper . " Greene 's interest brightened , and it began to be plain to Anson that all this man really cared about was writers and writing . " What kind of column ? " " It 's hard to say . It was n't anything like these columns you have in New York , if that 's what you mean . We have this historical society down home , the one I was telling you about  --  " " Yes ? " " Well , after I was old enough , by the time I went off to the university , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law review , and one of my professors thought I should write for it . I was interested in colonial law at the time  --  pre-Revolutionary law , to be exact  --  and that summer , when I went home , I started going through some of the old papers in the society 's library --  " Anson never once imagined that the day would come when he would be telling a New York editor about how he happened to start writing his column for the Morning News . He did not feel self-consciousabout it , though , and he did not think Phillip Greene was simply making conversation . It was getting late , however , and he still had Mr. Barlowe to consider ; if ever it was rumored that he had bored Phillip Greene all through lunch by talking about himself , there might be all sorts of adverse consequences . Against this , however , stood the fact that he was enjoying talking about himself . He would have to take his chances with Mr. Barlowe . " One day I happened to come across three letters that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The general is one of our big heroes . He was in command at the Battle of Little Pigeon Marsh , and we have a statue of him in one of our squares . Anyway , nobody knew about those letters from Lafayette . They had been tied up in a bundle of old legal papers by mistake . " " And you found them ? " " Yes sir , I did . I was pretty excited at first  --  I guess I naturally would be  --  but they turned out to be fairly unimportant . Lafayette had been given a bounty of land in our state and he wanted the generalto tell him how to go about selling it . He also said he had the gout . Look , Mr. Greene  --  are you sure you 're interested in this ? " " But of course I 'm interested , " Greene said . " Why should n't I be ? Lafayette 's having the gout makes him come alive , a real human being  --  mostof these great historical figures are all so dead . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with yourself . Did you do anything with the letters ? Did you write anything , I mean ? " " Yes sir , that 's what I 'm coming to . I told my father , bout them , and the next day he happened to see his friend , Mr. Joe Birke , the editor of our local paper , the Morning News . That night Mr. Birke called me up and asked me to write something about the letters . He must have liked what I wrote because he printed it almost the way I sent it in . A few days later I ran into Mr. Birke on Bay Street  --  that 's our main street  --  and he asked me to walk to the paper with him . He said that the historical association was probably full of things thatthe public did n't know about , things of general interest , and asked me if I would like to do some more stories . " " And finally it turned into a regular thing ? " " Yes sir , that 's about what happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I did a column three times a week . Old Pompey ' it was called . That 's how Pompey 's Head is known down home . Nobody ever calls it by its full name . " " It sounds like a fine place , " Greene said . " Why did you leave ? " Here it was , the inevitable question . But much as he had come to like Phillip Greene , Anson had no intention of answering . Somedayhe might be able to tell why he left Pompey 's Head , and even make it into something bright and entertaining , but not now . Not for a long time . Perhaps not ever . " I guess it 's the same old story , " he said . " I imagine I just wanted to get away . " Phillip Greene did not seem to be convinced . For a moment Anson thought he was going to be pressed for details , but , instead : " Those columns , " Greene said . " Are they the only writing you 've done ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , no sir . I could n't write a novel . " " How do you know ? " " I just do , that 's all . I feel that if I wanted to , or had anything like that in me , it would have made itself felt before now . All I ever wanted to be as a writer was a local historian . That would have suited me fine . I know it does n't make me sound very ambitious , but until I came North I do n't suppose I was . " " And now ? " Anson nodded . " Yes sir , I 'm ambitious . I 'd like to succeed in what I 'm doing . And someday , if I can find time , I 'd like to get back to my interest in history . 1 once wrote an article for the law review that I called The Shinto Tradition of the American South . ' I know it sounds presumptuous , and I do n't mean it that way , but I always thought that I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all right to call them my ideas  --  and develop them further into a book . That 's just one of those notions , though , and I do n't imagine I ever will . " Phillip Greene looked at him and finished his coffee . " I 'd like to see some of your writing , " he said . " Suppose you send me copies of those articles you did for the law review . And some of your columns too . " Anson did n't know what to say . " Well , if you really mean it  --  " 130Phillip Greene nodded and reached for the check . " I really mean it . It 's part of my job . I hope we can lunch together again . " Anson could never think of that day and that conversation withoutalso thinking that under normal conditions a man 's life was all of a piece . There were bound to be a few loose ends , threads that could not be fitted in anywhere , but except for these it made a whole design . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the eighth grade , getting himself paired off with Olive Paxton when he wanted to be paired with Midge Higgins , and his feet were set on a path that eventually would lead to a restaurant on Fifty-third Street and the beginning of his friendship with Phillip Greene . The ancients were right to imagine the Fates as weavers , he thought . There was a warp and a woof and always some design . He knew that there were men who planned their lives , setting their sights on a determined goal , and it sometimes troubled him that his own life appeared to have been so largely governed by chance . A visit to the museum with the eighth grade and a morning with John Duncanin a duck blind  --  it was easy to imagine the weavers at work . Take away either the one or the other , the museum or the duck blind , and it was inconceivable that he would be where he was . He would not have been given his desk at Roberts , Guthrie , Barlowe &; Paul , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have married Meg . For she too was part of the pattern . He met Meg the same clay he had lunch with Phillip Greene , just a few hours later  --  " And if you were honest , " Meg once said , " you would admit that meeting Phil was more important . I was simply a chore you had to perform . " &*t; There was just enough truth in Meg 's remark to make him feel uncomfortable . All that afternoon , after his lunch with Greene , he had to force himself to work . He could not forget what Greene had said about wanting to see some of the things he had written . Althoughhe knew it might be held against him , especially since Mr. Barlowe was away , he went to Mr. Guthrie , for whom he was also doing some work at the time , and said he would like to leave early . Mr. Guthrie was a small , paunchy man with a bald head and a round pink face . According to those who hold that personality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jolly , twinkling man with a cheerful word for everyone . Instead , he was sour , sarcastic , and full of impatience . He said , " Do I look like a housemaster , 131Page ? I hope to God not . If there is something you have to do , go ahead and do it . " Long ago though it was , Anson could remember it clearly . He had to rush  --  riding the subway to his apartment and bundling up the things for Greene ; hurrying to get the package into the mail before the branch post office on West Tenth Street closed at five  --  but he made it in time . Then , afterward , with the sweet taste of freedom sharpened by the knowledge that it was a weekday afternoon and New York somehow a warmer , friendlier place , he sat on one of the benches in Washington Square and read the newspaper in the late autumn sunlight before returning to his apartment to get ready for his date . He was still thinking about Phillip Greene when he reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . A uniformed doorman wanted to know if he was expected , and he still had the customary reservations about a blind date . He imagined , too , looking back on it , that before he saw Meg he had been a little put off by her being a career girl . He had been in New York long enough to have decided that career girls were not like the girls in Pompey 's Head . He supposed they were brighter , and certainly they were more ambitious , but he did not think they were as much fun . He doubted that this date that John Duncan had got him into would be much fun . That , however , was before he saw Meg . The moment she answered his ring everything began to take on a more promising look . " Hello , " she said , standing framed in the doorway in a black silk dress . " I 'm Meg Whitman and I suppose you 're Mr. Page . Come on in . If you want a drink , there 's some ice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cocktail but I did n't have time . " She smiled at him and he smiled back and it was pleasant merely to be in the same room with her . She was the prettiest girl he had seen in a long time . More , though , than merely pretty . There was a fresh , intelligent look on her face , an air of alertness that was concentrated in her clear blue eyes , and he could tell that behind her smile she was coming to a cool , calculated appraisal of him , chalking up his good points and ticking off the bad . Noting that her head came hardly to his shoulder , he saw that she was standing in her stocking feet . " Do n't be alarmed , " she said . " I do own a pair of slippers . It 's just that I have n't put them on . " " You do n't need any help , do you ? " 132It came out of its own volition , bubbling from the rush of well-beinghe felt , but immediately he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting he was not in Pompey 's Head . Joe Ann Williams or Gaby Carpenter would have taken it for what it was , understanding that it was just a thing to say and that he was not trying to be fresh , but up here in New York it was different . Say something like that to a Northern girl , and instead of laughing it off or saying , as Joe Ann might , " All right , but just below the ankles , remember , " immediately you were put in the position of making a pass . He waited to get slapped down , but , instead , dryly : " Out in Indiana we get helped with our slippers only on the second date , " Meg said . Anson was so relieved he had to laugh . " I did n't mean to rush things , " he said . " When 's the second date ? " She had not expected that , he saw . It took her a little off balance . He was still playing it according to the relaxed rules of Pompey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indiana . What she had just said was contrary to the ones she had grown up with , most likely a sign of her determination to be emancipated from them , and he should have been perceptive enough to understand . Her face became sober for a moment , and he felt that this time he had done it for sure . Again , however , he was offered a reprieve . Gazing at him steadily , but with a different , more calculating look in her eyes , she said : " I never have to work on Tuesday and Wednesday nights . " It was now his turn to be at a disadvantage ; one thing about this 0 girl , he thought  --  she was certainly quick on her feet . " Tomorrow night is Tuesday . " " No , not tomorrow . " " Wednesday . " " No , not Wednesday either . " " Next Tuesday then ? " She leveled her eyes at him , coolly appraising as before , and then , smiling : " Sure . Why not ? " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a black silk dress and they walked into each other 's lives , and it would be a long time before he ever forgot October 12 , 1936 . That large milestone even marked a change in his relation with Mr. Barlowe . Toward the end of the following week , after he and133Meg had their second date , Mr. Barlowe sent for him again . Mrs. Waggoner , Mr. Barlowe 's secretary , told him to go right on in . Mr. Barlowe was sitting behind his desk , and although his greeting was no more cordial than usual , he did seem less Olympian  --  for one thing , he asked Anson to sit down . He explained that one of the publishing houses was buying out the textbook department of another firm , and said that he wanted Anson to do the groundwork for him  --  sales figures , copyrights , outstanding obligations , and all the rest of it . " I need some help around here , " he grumbled . " I ca n't do everythingmyself . " There never had been a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew , but since Mr. Barlowe had descended far enough to the ordinary human level to pretend that he needed a moment 's sympathy , it seemed advisable to go along with him  --  " Yes sir , " Anson said . Being young and inexperienced , and almost totally ignorant of the ways of business , it was not until the interview was over and Mr. Barlowe had said in a careless fashion , " You seem to have made quite an impression the other day up at Duncan 's . Keep up the good work , " that he understood that Mr. Barlowe had decided to put him in the way of another chance . His feeling of elation was such that it must have showed in the way he carried himself . Mrs. Waggoner , who occupied a small office that adjoined Mr. Barlowe 's , looked up from her typewriter , and then , as their eyes met , she gave him a friendly nod  --  Mr. Barlowe must have said something about it to her too . Anson 's elation persisted throughout the day . Wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her office . In the end , however , he decided against it . When put into words , it did not sound like much , and Meg might not understand . Only he could appreciate it properly . He had managed to acquit himself creditably the day he had lunch with Phillip Greene and word of it had found its way downtown  --  he had taken his jumps without a fault and Mr. Barlowe was not going to whistle him off the course . In retrospect it was easy to see that he owed it all to Phil , just as he owed so much else . It was Phil who had given him his first leg up , and now Phil was dead , unable to defend himself . This damnable thing had happened , coming out of nowhere , and Julian Tokar had caused the prospect to appear darker than ever before . CHAPTER TENLighting another cigarette , Anson , sitting at the desk in his room in the Marlborough , turned to the notes he made after his meeting withJulian Tokar and Van Buren Bliss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it had resulted in little more than adding to the background . What stood out most clearly was that Tokar 's bitterness toward Mrs. Wales was greater than that of anyone else . Tokar was waiting for them in the men 's bar of the Ritz . Van Buren Bliss , catching sight of him at a table on the far side of the room , lifted a hand in greeting as he and Anson hung their hats and topcoats on one of the old-fashioned racks that stood near the door through which you entered from Madison Avenue  --  so that , Anson thought , was Julian Tokar . It would not do to stare , however , and he had time to note only that Tokar had either just returned from a hot climate after an extended visit or else had an uncommonly dark complexion , when , having followed Bliss across the room , which was already crowded even though it was not yet five o'clock , he was being introduced , trying to conceal his surprise at Tokar 's excessive height . It was curious , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been told of Tokar 's library , of his small but impressive collection of modern art , and of his penthouse apartment overlooking Gracie Square and the East River . No one , however , had ever consideredit worth mentioning that the man stood at least six feet four . Anson observed that it took a certain amount of ingenuity for him to fold himself back into his chair , but there was no trace of the awkwardnessthat is common to most people who have been overgener-134 135ously endowed in the way of height . Like his inherited fortune , it was something to which Tokar had plainly learned to adjust . " I 'm drinking rum , " he said . " It sounds appalling , I know , but I 've developed a taste for the stuff . Besides , I like to pretend that I 'm still basking on the beach at Montego Bay . " Van Buren Bliss said , " Just do n't rub it in , that 's all , " and then , to Anson , " What 'll you have ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He passed on their wants to the waiter , a bourbon and water for Anson , a scotch old-fashioned for himself , and turned back to Tokar . " How 's Molly ? " he inquired . " I do n't have to ask about you  --  you 've never looked better . How was the trip ? " Anson was glad to be omitted from the conversation . It gave him a chance to fit himself into his surroundings and to have a closer look at Julian Tokar . The men 's bar of the Ritz and Tokar rather complementedeach other , he thought . He himself was a stranger here and always would be , despite the protective plumage that enabled him to fade effortlessly into the background , but it was plainly a part of Tokar 's natural environment . It was as fitting for him to speak regretfully of the passing of the Ritz , which , it had been announced , was going to be torn down and replaced by an office building , as it was for him to mention the improvement that a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City was his own special place , identified with his family for five generations , and , like all born-and-bred New Yorkers of whatever station , he had developed a set of highly personalized responses to its various stimuli  --  Anson could not imagine him anywhere else . " And so you got to the Caymans ? " Van Buren Bliss was saying . " But why ? Why the Caymans of all places ? " " Stamps , " Tokar answered . " When I was a boy I used to collect stamps . Now I 'm trying to collect a few of the places they made me want to see . You do n't believe me ? Would n't you like to go to a place called Grand Cayman ? Or Ascension ? Or the Cook Islands ? " " No , I would n't , " Bliss said . " I think stamps are a lot of damned nonsense and I have yet to lay my eyes on Rome . " Anson regarded Tokar with renewed interest . He was sure that in his own circle Tokar had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of him , part of the impression created by his long frame , his expressive hands , his simple yet elegant dress , his rather triangular head with its dark skin , narrow nose , and flat , thin mustache that emphasized the strong , firmly delineated lines of his mouth . It even went with his small , exclusive stable of clients  --  theatrical people , 136musical people , literary people , artistic people of all kinds . They would require more of their lawyer than brilliance ; it would be regarded as essential that he also be amusing . " All horsing aside , Julian , " Van Buren Bliss said , " what made you go to the Caymans ? " Tokar lifted his eyebrows in mock surprise . " Why ca n't you believe what I say ? I 've wanted to visit them for as long as I can remember . We had to drive to Kingston for the day , and I went into the Myrtle Bank for a drink . There was this Englishman there , a young fellow , one of those odd-fish Britishers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd started an airline from Kingston to Grand Cayman  --  which , as you would n't have to be told had you ever collected stamps , is the largest of the Cayman group . Although Molly did n't think much of the idea , I said why not ? I 'm pushing sixty now and the chances are that what I do n't do soon , I wo n't do . " " I feel sorry for you , " Van Buren Bliss said . " You 've had such a sedentary life . " " When Garvin lived in Jamaica , " Tokar continued , " we always talked about going to the Caymans . A few New England whaling captains finally dropped anchor there  --  quite a number , as a matter of fact  --  and Garvin thought he 'd like to do a book . We never got there , though . Garvin was all for it , but Lucy was n't , as it should not be necessary to say , and so we never got off . Having the Caymans in my system , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . It was a beautiful trip and the beach on Grand Cayman is absolutely one of the most beautiful in the world . But that 's enough about me . I do n't think I 'm giving away any secrets , Mr. Page , when I say that I hear you are having your troubles  --  what can I do to help ? " The transition was so abrupt that Anson was taken unprepared . He had been thinking that the Cayman Islands sounded like a wonderfullyunspoiled place , reminded of the time when he wanted to go to Burma to gather the seeds of wild plants , and his immediate impression was that already he was encountering a set of attitudes with which he had become familiar  --  affection for Garvin Wales , hostility toward Mrs. Wales . Wondering how much of the situation Van Buren Bliss had divulged , he said : " I do n't exactly know , Mr. Tokar . I had n't thought . " " This is the way it is , Julian , " Van Buren Bliss interjected . " Somethinghas come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anson is going South to have a meeting with Lucy . " 137 " What a pleasant prospect , " Tokar said , looking at Anson . " You do n't know how much I envy you . " " Of course , " Bliss went on , " the matter ought to be handled by Garvin . In the end it will have to be , since it 's something that only he can straighten out . You know the way things stand , though , and unless Anson manages to get to Garvin through Lucy --  " Tokar , addressing Anson , said , " They do make you earn your keep , do n't they ? Did they think to tell you that you were being asked to do the impossible ? I hope you 'll see fit to at least treble your fee . " " Never mind that , " Bliss said . " The point is this  --  Anson , not knowing Lucy or Garvin , has been asking me questions that I do n't know enough to answer . I thought it might be helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't mind --  " " Mind ? " Tokar said . " I 'm flattered . What is it , NIr . Page , that you 'd like to know ? " Confronted with the question , Anson did not know how to answer . What should be done , of course , was to take Tokar wholly into his confidence . He was not yet prepared , however , to go that far . " It 's hard to say , " he ventured . " Ordinarily , under normal circumstances , this whole thing could be cleaned up with a telephone call . Here , though  --  well , everything is being made more difficult by Mrs. Wales . It may sound unfair , but that 's the way it seems . " Tokar shook his head . " No , Mr. Page , not seems  --  is ! You have been hearing about Lucy from John Duncan , I imagine , and to a lesser extent from Van , and you 're probably wondering if she is nearly as black as she has been painted . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid you 've come to the wrong man . You see , Mr. Page , I know Lucy Wales . John Duncan thinks he does , and Van has been able to pick up enough gossip to imagine he does --  " " That 's where you 're wrong , " Van Buren Bliss broke in . " I know better than that . " " But with me it 's different , " Tokar continued . " I 've seen Lucy in action . Not once , not twice , but dozens of times . May I give you a piece of advice ? I do n't know what 's come up , and just to make everybodycomfortable I 'd like to say that I would prefer not to know , but if it 's Lucy you have to contend with , as Van says , do n't make the mistake of thinking that you are dealing with a woman . You happen to be dealing with evil in its most absolute form . " Anson felt a stab of annoyance . That kind of talk got you nowhere . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice from its conversational level  --  that he had practically thrown the line away , 138as they said on the stage  --  put a sharper edge to his displeasure . The casual , almost indolent delivery was apparently part of the technique of being amusing . Anson could see Tokar arranging his elongated frame near one of his pictures , a Leger or a Juan Gris or a Mire ) , standing with a cocktail in his hand and saying to a select group of guests , " Lucy Wales ? Believe me , I know that woman  --  if , that is , woman she may be called . " Under the spur of his annoyance , Anson found himselfhalf wanting to defend Mrs. Wales . John Duncan , Van Buren Bliss , and now Julian Tokar  --  an outsider might easily conclude that she was being ganged up on . " That 's a pretty strong statement , is n't it ? " he said . Julian Tokar nodded affably . " Yes , a very strong statement  --  it was intended to be . I think you will discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strong statements . And if , as I suspect , you are thinking that there must be a considerable amount of bias involved , the answer is why yes , there is . I would n't like to pretend otherwise . " He smiled pleasantly and finished his drink . " As I said , Mr. Page , if it 's a favorable character reference you want for Lucy , I 'm afraid you 've come to the wrong man . She had me thrown out of her house , which was a blow to my pride , and she destroyed a friendshipthat I valued most highly . " He crossed and uncrossed his legs , getting them out of the way . " I must say , though , lest you think that I am more prejudiced than I am , that I do n't hold her entirely responsible  --  thereal damage was done by Garvin . After seventeen years I expected more of him . Lucy , unfortunately , is not the whole story . I thought Garvin might have stood up  --  not for me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his last chance . But Lucy commanded and he obeyed . He did n't even want not to obey . That was the distressingthing , to see the utter coward he 'd turned into . " Van Buren Bliss , who was filling his pipe , said stonily , " You do go in for strong statements , do n't you ? " " Yes , I suppose I do , " Tokar agreed , looking around for their waiter . " But so far as Garvin is concerned , I am not interested in evasive ones . The trouble is that you people at Duncan 's have always been under the shadow of Phil Greene  --  you ca n't admit certain truths about Garvin because , if you do , they are bound to reflect on Phil . What was the point of that long-suffering selflessness of his , it would have to be asked , if Garvin turned out not to be worth it ? " " Oh , what the hell , Julian ! " " There you go again . " Tokar 's voice was touched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to run away from
