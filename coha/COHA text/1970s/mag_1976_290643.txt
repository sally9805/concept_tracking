With a final sharp spurt , the stock market last week finished its most explosively bullish month ever . Easily shaking off some midweek profit taking , the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24 points on the last two trading days to close on Friday at 975 , its highest mark since October 1973 . That brought the rise for all of January to 123 points , the most for any month in history . Even more astonishing was the hectic pace of trading on the New York Stock Exchange : January rewrote every volume record in the Big Board book . The month witnessed the highest turnover in one hour ( 12.1 million shares between 10 and 11 a.m. , Jan. 30 ) in one day ( 38.51 million shares , again Jan. 30 ) , in one week ( 162.2 million last week ) - and , of course , in one month . During January 635.9 million shares changed hands , or 39% more than in May 1975 , the previous record . <P> The bulls ' rampage was good news for investors-and indeed for everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : nine times out of ten , says Wall Street Analyst Yale Hirsch , a strong performance then presages rising prices for the year as a whole . Of broader significance , the stock market , which reflects the hopes , hunches and knowledge of millions of investors , is one of the most accurate predictors of the course of the nation 's economy-duly recognized as such by the Government , which officially classes the market as a leading indicator. * Since 1873 the market 's upsurges and downturns have preceded by an average of six months the peaks and valleys of the nation 's economic cycles ; only a few times has it been wrong . Hence January 's message was clear : good times ahead . Says David Babson , the Boston financier : " The stock market is saying that people think the recovery will continue , and I see no reason to disagree . " <P> One factor in the market 's record for accurate economic prophecies is that they tend to be self-fulfilling . Economists generally agree that the market has at least some limited power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : rising share prices enable a company to use its stock to make acquisitions , or sell new shares to get cash to expand . But the biggest lift is psychological . A bull market puts executives in an expansive mood , as the worth of their stock options goes up , and raises the morale of employees , who see the value of their stake in pension funds increase . Consumers who own stock directly or through mutual funds feel richer . If they do not have ready cash , a rising market increases their ability to borrow : readily marketable stock that is going up in price is excellent collateral on loans .
