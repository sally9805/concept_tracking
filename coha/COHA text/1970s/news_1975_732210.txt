txt Letters to the Editor pg . 32 Letters to the Editor On Dooming High-Speed Train Service To the Editor : The recent announcement by the Department of Transportation that it was abandoning plans for developing high-speed passenger train service in the Northeast Corridor because it was " too costly " shocked all of us who have been concerned with this longplanned objectiVe . In November of 1970 , long before the energy crisis , the same department issued a report stating that " high-speed trains offer the only hope of relieving congestion , pollution and delay in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor in the ' 70s . " The unfortunate decision is also in complete opposition to : ? The expressed will of a great majority of the American public , according to several polls , favoring railroad passenger trains . ? The mandate of Congress , as last stated in the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 . ? The proposals of the United States Railway Association , a body set up by this act to restructure the bankrupt Penn Central , which called ' not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for the initiation of high-speed service in ten or more intercity runs of intermediate distance . What is the result of this footdragging by the Federal Government for the past five years ? The U.S. remains the only highly industrialized In his article , Mr. Arbatov strongly objects to American emphasis on this section . He reproaches us for various acts of our Government , and where justified these must be corrected . But it is true , as Mr. Amalrik so well states it , that the strength of America 's foreign policy is a genuine and sincere concern for the welfare of people . And now , with " Basket 3 , " we have every right to speak for these human concerns . For the first time they are a part of an international agreement , signed by 35 nations . No longer can they be termed purely internal matters , improper for international notice or action . Now that this has been established , it is incumbent upon us to see how well the nations are complying  --  are families really allowed to reunite ? Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Heath Lesson To the Editor : There is a lesson for President Ford in the experience of former Prime Minister Edward Heath of Great Britain . As the British economic situation steadily deteriorated in late 1973 and early 1974 , many Conservatives saw the miners ' strike as an opportunity to rally support behind their faltering government . Prime Minister Heath decided to meet the challenge of the miners ' action head-on . He called the February 1974 general election on the issue of " Who governs Britain ? " ? " them " ( the unions ) or " us " ( the Government ) . It looked like  --  a smart move . The polls showed that the British electorate was not in sympathy with the miners ' strike and was , indeed , supportive of the Government 's wagecontrol policy and resentful of the growing power of the trade unions . But the strategy did n't work . The voters refused to be polarized . The election turned into a referendum . on Heath 's leadership , not a showdown on the miners ' strike . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoking confrontation and held him responsible for tke consequences ? even though most voters probably agreed with his position to begin with . The election brought down the Conservative Government and ultimately ended Mr. Heath 's career . The lesson for President Ford ? That political leaders exploit confrontation at their own peril , even if the polls are on their side . Such leaders gain the dangerous reputation of being stubborn and divisive men . And the voters will not fail to hold them responsible for the consequences of their actions . WILLIAM SCHNEIDER Asst . Prof. , Government , Harvard Cambridge , Mass. , Nov. 1 , 1975 ( I am tempted to say " civilized " ) country that does not possess a balanced transportation policy or practice . In 1970 , for instance , 87 percent of our intercity travel was by the private car , 1 percent by rail . All European countries and , of course , Japan have fine high-speed passenger trains and are concentrating on their further development . No one questions the convenience and flexibility of the family car , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one city to another several hundred miles apart . The Transportation Department 's decision could have long-term effects far more costly than the abandoned plans , not only to the taxpayer but to the environment and the price of energy . Existing railroad rights-of-way cost far less to upgrade and maintain than the building of interstate highways . And , of course , anyone who has ridden a really first-class foreign train realizes that there is no comparison in comfort or dependability . We have expended our interest and our Federal , state and local funds far too long on the automobile , and to a lesser extent the plane , at the expense of our railroads . The only answer to the shortsighted decision by the Administration is a resounding public appeal to.the Congress to override . CLEVELAND S. WHITE West Falmouth , Mass. , Nov. 1 , 1975 freely through the mail in these nations ? I have introduced  --  along with sixteen other members of the House of Representatives  --  a bill to set up a commission specially charged to monitor compliance , with special reference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information on these subjects , and we hope that it will give d ? tente a clear base of understanding : Each signatory nation will have its own special concerns , but all must be honored . For this country , " Basket 3 " and the hope it offers is central . MILLICENT FENWICK Member of Congress , 5th Dist. , N.J. Washington , Oct. 22 , 1975 Unhappy Republican To the Editor : I am an old lady , a Republican for years who has lived through many wars and many American Presidencies , but never did I think I would see the time when an American President would attack so viciously and publicly any city in the nation . This is the grossest kind of political campaigning I have ever witnessed . One can not imagine Franklin Roosevelt or John Kennedy tearing apart the fabric of life of so many Americans as those in New York City , but , these Presidents had intelligence , manners , class and humanitarianism . I am voting for the Democrats . SARA L. MULLIN Watertown , N. Y. , Nov. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : In reference to the Oct. 28 Op-Ed article " Amber ( Get ) Waves ( Your ) of ( Plastic ) Grain ( Uncle Sam ) " by John Gardner , I would like to point out a factual error pertaining to the American Freedom Train . The statement " . . . a train which carries authentic documents and a simulation of the ' historic ' baseball Hank Aaron hit " is incorrect . The actual baseball and bat that Hank Aaron used to hit his 714th home run are among the more than 500 other original documents , art treasures and memorabilia aboard the train . At a July 5 ceremony in Detroit , Mr. Aaron himself rededicated his baseball and bat to the train and stated that his ball and bat were getting better protection aboard the Freedom Train than the - gold in Fort Knox . SY FREEDMAN American Freedom Train Foundation New York , Oct. 29 , 1975 What Zionism Is To the Editor : Those who are familiar with the Holocaust are not surprised to witness the spectacle in the United Nations pertaining to Zionism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spells out " the ultimate danger " to be caused by final passage of this resolution . It was not long ago that humanity failed to react to a lonely voice , and as a result , six million Jews evaporated without a trace . It seems that the tragic experience of the Holocaust did not penetrate the consciousness of the general public , or even the intelligentsia . No wonder that the Third World in the U.N . is mute about Red China 's aggression , about genocide in Cambodia , and gladly listens to Uganda 's president Idi Amin , a noted murderer and racist , who was not ashamed to send an open letter to the U.N . Secretary Waldheim extolling Hitler and Nazism . How could a group of Moslemdominated states , whose credo is to convert the world to the Islamic religion , ( Philip K. Hitti , " History of the Arabs " and G. von Grunebaum , " Medieval Islam " ) manage through a committee which carries the label " Humanitarian and Culture " pass a resolution equating Zionism with ) racism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created ? " For out of Zion shall go forth the law and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem . " This has been the motto of Judaism , which for centuries , in spite of pogroms , persecutions and death succeeded in reestablishing a state in its original homeland with the approval of the United Nations . If Zionism is racism , then the Hebrew Christian Bible is racist . Are Isaiah 's words spelling out Zionist hopes at the entrance to the U.N . racist propaganda ? I recall that on one of my visits to the U.S.S.R. I was asked by a leader of the Ministry of Education , " What is Zionism ? " My reply was : " It is the Jewish effort throughout ages to emancipate itself from world imperialism . " I think it is proper to state now that Zionism has become the Jewish attempt to emancipate itself from Moslem and Third World imperialism . Since this " humanitarian and cultural " resolution is a blatant attempt to foster anti-Semitism on a worldwide scale , it becomes a challenge to all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become still as in the past , in order not to become a partner to genocide . " The voice of thy brother 's blood crieth out , " humanity where art thou ? ABRAHAM KATSH President , The Dropsie University Philadelphia , Oct. 27 , 1975 ? To the Editor : Your Oct. 30 edition carried an advertisement by the Zionist Organization of America that stated , among other things , that " Zionism is synonymous sic with Judaism . An attack on Zionism is an attack on the Jewish people . " That statement by these selfproclaimed spokesmen does a grave disservice to the many , many Jews in the U.S. who do not support the Zionist movement . JOSEPH N. ULMAN JR . Bethany , Conn. , Oct. 31 , 1975 ? The Wanton Atrocities To the Editor : Your Nov. 1 edition speaks of a youth who brutally killed a girl of eighteen to steal her bicycle and was given a sentence of eighteen months . On Page 29 , Ruth C. Adams recounts in a soberly chilling manner " the Code of Honor " which governs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pennsylvania doe season . There is a striking similarity in the atrocity of such acts : In both cases lives were extinguished wantonly , and cruel suffering was imposed on those who died , and those who loved them , by men who either lack the brains or the conscience to control their sinister whims . In both cases the failure of other men whose duty it is to apply the laws of the land will encourage and promote endless repetitions of such obscenities . In both cases the complacent indifference of public opinion to the daily violence which pollutes our society will make readers forget this horror . Yet surely all of us are involved  --  not just the victims or their killers . SADRUDDIN AGA KHAN U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees Geneva , Nov. 3 , 1975 ? Of Sweden 's Arms To the Editor : On Nov. 5 The Times published a letter from Joseph Winston contrasting Sweden 's high military output on a G.N.P . per capita basis with official Swedish remarks concerning Western world arms production . I would like to point out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the fourth in the world on a per capita basis . This figure must , however , be seen in the context of Sweden 's G.N.P . per capita as a whole which is the highest in the world . Furthermore , Sweden ( as a country not member to any military alliance ) must adapt its defense costs to_the the realities of a world dominated , by the two superpowers . In this connection I would also like to recall that Sweden in 1975 , alone among the industrialized countries , consecrates 1 percent of its G.N.P . to official development assistance to Third World countries , as compared e.g. with 0.25 for the U.S. 1NGA THORSSON Under Secretary of State Permanent Mission of Sweden to the U.N . New York , Nov. 5 , 1975 Complying With the Helsinki Accord To the Editor : The comments published recently in The Times by Georgi Arbatov , chief of the Canada-U.S . Institute of the U.S.S.R. , and the Oct. 22 Op-Ed article of Mr. Amalrik clearly suggest the importance of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and particularly " Basket 3 , " the section dealing with such human concerns as reunification of families , freedom of movement and freedom of information .
