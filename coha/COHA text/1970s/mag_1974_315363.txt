If a single product could take credit for West Germany 's " economic miracle , " it would be the Volkswagen Beetle . Since the start of production 36 years ago , 18 million copies of the inelegant rear-engine car designed by Ferdinand Porsche have been sold round the world ; yet now the world 's joyride with the Beetle appears to have stalled , so thoroughly that production has ground to a temporary halt . <P> Worldwide sales of Volkswagenwerk AG have slumped 21.6% so far this year , and officials openly predict that the company in 1974 will suffer the first full-year loss in its history . ( Profits in 1973 were $40 million ; at their peak in 1966 they totaled $151 million . ) Last week Volkswagen closed down most of its West German plants and gave 45,000 workers a two-week furlough with partial pay . <P> Company spokesmen cite rising costs as the principal cause of Volkswagen 's financial troubles . During 1974 , they say , the company faces wage increases of $221 million and a jump of more than $301 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis has left a lingering reluctance on the part of many consumers to buy new cars , even the gas-efficient , economy Beetle . <P> Hammering Away . A bigger factor , however , is that the Beetle is not the economy car it once was . Largely because of repeated devaluations of the U.S. dollar and upward revaluations of the German mark , the price of Volkswagens in the past 18 months rose 30% in the U.S. , a market that accounts for one-third of all Beetle sales worldwide . The port-of-entry price of a Super Beetle in the U.S. , without options or accessories , is $2,849 , compared with a basic $2,442 for a similarly stripped-down Ford Pinto . It is a fact that U.S. and Japanese competitors have been quick to exploit-Ford TV ads , for instance , hammer away at price comparisons between the Super Beetle and the Pinto-and during the first quarter this year U.S. sales of Volkswagens plummeted 28% . <P> Even in Europe , Volkswagen is meeting increasingly stiff competition from small-car competitors like Simca and Opel , and this year 's sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of fuel , Volkswagen has even been losing a good share of its market to the much thirstier Mercedes-Benz , suggesting to some VW officials that the beloved Beetle configuration may have finally outlived its attractiveness . As a result , the company that once turned a one-model line into an advertising asset has been introducing a whole new array of cars . <P> The man in charge of this transformation is Rudolf Leiding , 59 , a onetime repair-shop manager who became chairman of Volkswagenwerk three years ago . Though 5,500 Beetles had continued rolling off the assembly lines each day until last week 's shutdown , Leiding has been gradually shifting some of Volkswagen 's eggs out of the Beetle basket . Volkswagen 's subsidiary , Audi NSU Auto Union AG , formed in 1969 , now offers medium-priced and expensive ( up to $5,360 ) sedans , most notably the Audi 80 , called the Fox in the U.S. Sales of these cars are rising faster than anything else the company makes .
