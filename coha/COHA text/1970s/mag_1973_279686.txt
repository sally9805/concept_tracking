SHAMUS <P> Directed by BUZZ KULIK Screenplay by BARRY BECKERMAN <P> Burt Reynolds must be the first actor ever to have been influenced by a television star . In Shamus he often seems to be doing Johnny Carson impressions , as if too many appearances on the Tonight show have left him with a chronic case of mimesis . " Healthy devil , are n't you ? " he murmurs to a top-heavy ingenue , who promptly melts at his wit . ' Thought we might do a little skindiving , " he suggests to a hat-check girl , who replies , " Bring your snorkel . " <P> Reynolds not only sometimes sounds like Carson , with his voice full of curdled cuteness , but acts like him , too , doing long , innocent , slightly baffled takes and little-boy expressions of wonderment . Why Reynolds bothers with this remains mysterious , because when he is doing the material straight , he is truly funny , dexterous and quite winning . <P> He plays it straight enough of the time to keep kicking Shamus along at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective from Brooklyn named McCoy , who is hired by a rich businessman to recover some stolen diamonds . The whole business is pretty shady , and McCoy gets roughed up or punched out in every scene where he is not bantering with or bedding a society type ( Dyan Cannon ) from Sutton Place . The plot makes no sense , although it tries . It all ends with one of those tenuous solutions that raise more questions than they actually answer . <P> The script is shoddy enough so that Reynolds might well have been tempted to send it up ; maybe that is what he meant to do with the Carson impressions . Screenwriter Beckerman lifts at least two scenes from Howard Hawks 's The Big Sleep . He may know quality but he can not duplicate it , and never makes up his mind whether to do straight hard-boiled melodrama or imitation Damon Runyon . No such doubts apparently plagued the director . He establishes a consistent tone of massive mayhem . Kulik attempts to disguise every lapse in logic with a lapse in taste . - J.C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
