txt Even if Ottawa is firm against the Front de Liberation ' du Quebec ( FLQ ) demands , the radical separatist group may have won a victory by changing the nature of Canadian politics . " We can no longer be so easygoing as we have been with this threat from people bent on taking power for power 's sake , " a Cabinet official in Ottawa said . " It means we have to be aware that there are forces throughout the world that are bent on disrupting normal society and no longer can we be oblivious to it . " Like so many officials in government , the speaker asked not to be identified in view of the current tension . Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau may well be the first to undergo change in style . He has been quite casual in his movements and frequently slips out to a movie or a restaurant in Ottawa without any bodyguard . Seldom does he have more than one Mountie acting as guard . This now is changing . The Toronto Star asked : " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that the FLQ has made violence against individuals an instrument of politics ? " We may be passing from the age of innoceme to the age of security with guards , walls , and bulletproof glass to separate the leaders from the people . " // *Violence jolts Canada // But as the hours pass and Canadians await new word on last week 's unresolved kidnappings , a steady barrage of warnings about new kidnappings and possible terrorism in many parts of Canada are being heard . The arrival late Oct. 12 of Canadian Army units in the Ottawa area to reinforce the Royal Canadian Mounted Police protection of officials and diplomats was accompanied by word that two Cabinet officers had been threatened . Threats from cranks ? ? Some of these threats , both to federal Cabinet officials as well as to Quebec provincial officials , may well be the work of cranks . But the Canadian Government is not taking any chances  --  and the stepped-up security in Ottawa , Quebec City , and particularly Montreal is evidence of this new attitude . Prime Minister Trudeau 's movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police activity in the Montreal area have been stepped up . Checks on planes departing Montreal have been frequent following several bomb reports which proved to be false but which delayed numerous flights out of the city 's Dorval Airport . All this activity , unusual for easygoing Canadians , has led to the mood of anxiety which many Canadians now feel . Some Canadians are talking about the events of the past 10 days in which the kidnappings occurred as the ending of the age of innocence in Canadian politics . With troops augmenting the fully manned mounted police units in Quebec and Ontario , Canadians are being brought up against the same problems facing nations in Latin America , the Middle East , and elsewhere . Former Prime Minister John Diefenbaker 's comment on the situation is typical . He said Canada has become " little more than another Banana republic . " That may be too premature a suggestion . But it does point up the sudden Canadian awareness that violence is a factor in Canadian life . It came as a shock .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
