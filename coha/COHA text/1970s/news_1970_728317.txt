txt An in-depth assessment of the war from Republican National Chairman Rogers Morton was carried in-the Jan. 2 edition of this newspaper . Sen. George McGovern , a leading critic of the administration on the Vietnam war , sees " no early end to the war " as long as " we 're still wedded to the Thieu-Ky ' regime . " While giving credit to President Nixon for troop reductions , the South Dakota Senator says , " We 're ' on ' the wrong course . " In a year-end interview with The Chrfstian Science Monitor , the Senator , ' a very probable candidate for president in 1972 , also charged the administration with " government by propaganda . " By this he said he meant , " an effort to manipulate the people behind administration policy rather than changing the policy along lines that we had hoped the President would follow " ( on the war ) . In other comments , the Sen-ator : ? Used the word " significant " in .. describing GOP chairman Rogers Morton 's prediction of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months . But he added that , he was still skeptical . ? Gave Mr. Nixon credit for expanding food-assistance programs , for progress in family assistance , and fdr draft and tax reform . - The interview with Senator McGovern follows : Senator , at year 's end , would you please assess the Nixon administration for us ? On the negative side , my big disappointment in this administration centers in the failure of President Nixon to move quickly to liquidate our involvement in Vietnam . I think we 're still wedded to the Thieu-Ky regime . And as long as we continue in that posture I do n't see an early end to the war in Vietnam . * Please turn ' to Page 2 By a staff photographer Senator McGovern ' Skeptical of Nixon timetable gays U.S. on wrong Viet course Centinnedireint Page ? 1 I believe that the President 's election stemmed in considerable part , perhaps to a major extent , frOm the dissatisfaction with the previous administration 's handling of the war in Vietnam . And While the President has made some reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we continue to cling to the maintenance of an unpopular regime in Saigon . I think as long as that is our policy we 're on the wrong course . Yet a year has gone by and the President appears to have a good part of the public behind him on the war issue . Has n't this been a rather remarkable achievement , that he would still be able to keep this kind a support ? This leads Me to what is my second disappointment with this administration . This is what I could call " government by propaganda " an effort to manipulate the people behind adminiatrition policy rather than changing the policy along lines that we had hoped the President would follow on the basis of what he said during the campaign . Let me be very frank about it . I really believed in 1968 that candidate Nixon would quickly end this war if he were elected . And I think instead of that what he has done is to concentrate on managing American public opinion to support what is essentially the same policy we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the Vice-President loose in a series of speeches designed very frankly to discredit the peace movement . There 's no question about that . Those speeches were aimed at the more articulate young people on university campuses who were sparking the peace effort in the university community . They were aimed at those senators and congressmen who 'd been speaking out . And they were aimed at liberal network commentators on television and liberal papers that had been speaking out editorially against our policy in Vietnam and had continued that criticism of the Nixon administration . I gather that you see great danger here ? Yes . I think it 's a very dangerous trend When the United States Government uses its great influence and power to silence legitimate criticism and legitimate dissent . The President by doing that has temporarily won probably the support of the majority of the Atherican people for his policy in Vietnam . He 's had Vice-President Agnew taking the low road in undercutting the critics . He himself has command on nationwide television and radio and in well-publicized and well-advanced speeches to present his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has , himself , avoided direct assaUlts on his critics . But what he 's held out is tile hope of-peace based on his repeated assurances that that is his goal and based on the dramatic announcements of troop re suctions whiCh leave the impression , I think , , in the minds of most Americans that we 're moving out about as rapidly as we can . So that we 've had a kind of government by public relations , government by propaganda , government by manipulation , which I find a very , very disturbing trend . Has there been some substance , though , to the troop withdrawals ? themselves and to the Vietnamization over there ? Has n't there ben some movement toward getting out of the war ? Yes , I think as I indicated earlier , and I want to spell that out clearly , that President Nixon deserves some points for reducing the number of troops there . We had been.escalating up until now . He does deserve credit for that . He deserves whatever credit is involved in trying to turn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could describe in just one sentence what I think is wrong with the Nixon administration 's approach to Vietnam and what I think we ought to do , I would put it this way : Instead of seeking to Vietnamize the war , we ought to be trying to Vietnamize the government in South Vietnam . Now what do I mean by that ? I mean this , that I think it 's a very cruel if not immoral policy for us to be creating a client state in South Vietnam and then encouraging them with our arms and our money to continue the slaughter of their own people . This is basically what is involved in Vietnamization  --  it 's an effort to fight a war by proxy , to use the massive technology of the United States to arm one side of a civil war . Now if we want to see this war come to an end on a more humane and rational basis than simply arming the Vietnamese to fight it out among themselves , I would say that we ought to Vietnamese &; government in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our support for Mr. President Thieu and Marshal Key and in doing so to create the kind of political situation where they would be forced to go out and form a much broader coalition government  --  where they would have no other alternative except to embrace many of the political groups whose leaders are now imprisoned in Saigon and to perhaps invite some of the exiles to return and form what would amount to a transitional peace government in Saigon that would have the credibility to negotiate a settlement with the Viet Cong . Skepticism voiced That 's , really the way to end . the war  --  on a negotiated basis and on a more enduring political basis that would hold out the hope for real stability and peace in South Vietnam , Rogers C. B. Morton said to me the other day ? he 'd just talked to the President  --  that lie was absolutely convinced that Nixon was going to get us out of this war . And further . more , he predicted that we 'll be out of any kind of combat role within six to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant prediction , Mr. Sperling , Because Rogers Morton is a very thoughful , and I think shrewd , effective political spokesman . I have a high regard for his ability and , for his understanding of American politics . I have heard several assurances of that kind from people who haVe talked to the President . - I . have to be candid with you and tell you that I am still skeptical of the validity of that interpretation . But : : I hope I 'm wrong . I ' hope very much that the- President is using this kind of tough rhetoric about how we 're not going to yield ' and we 're going to keep our commitments , that we 're going to stand by General Thieu and Marshal KyI hope he 's using that as a political device to kind of disarm the right-wing critics here at home . And that he really behind that rhetoric has the intention of withdrawing on the kind of timetable that Congressman Morton says he does . . Now what do you see as the pluses of the Nixon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two most significant achievements of the administration are , first of all , progress that has been made in expanding our food-assistance programs . I give the Nixon administration rattier high marks in quickly grasping the urgency of the malnutrition problem in this country and moving to meet it . That does n't mean they 've solved the problem , but the rhetoric has been right , the commitments haVe been right , and some modest steps have been taken in meeting that problem . Second to that I would like to applaud the President for being the first American president to talk about family assistance in a new framework . He has said that this administration will move in 1970 and 1971 to provide a minimum income for the needy families in this country who are unable to work . And he has suggested what I think is a useful emphasis : that the prOgram ought to be geared in such a way that it does not penalize the working poor . . . . And I give the President a good score in at least recommending a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
