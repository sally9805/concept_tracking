Paul Dudley White 's start as a practicing physician 60 years ago coincided with the hesitant , unheralded beginnings of a new medical specialty : cardiology . Dr. White nurtured and grew with it : for almost half a century his name was synonymous with the study , treatment and prevention of heart disease . Last week , as the American Heart Association was preparing to add to White 's endless string of awards , death-from complications following a stroke-robbed him of what would have been a most appropriate honor . <P> White was to have received the James B. Herrick award , named for the Chicago physician ( 1861-1954 ) who in 1912 first accurately described a coronary-artery shutdown in a living patient and in effect added the term coronary thrombosis to the language . Previously , doctors had assumed that no one could survive a heart attack . They had viewed the post-mortem finding of a coronary thrombosis merely as an interesting item of pathology , and no particular significance was attached to Herrick 's report , which he admitted " fell like a dud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul White ( M.D. , Harvard , 1911 ) , who was then switching from pediatrics to heart disease because a sister had died from the aftereffects of rheumatic fever . After White 's internship , Harvard financed a trip to London , where he bought a newfangled invention , the electrocardiograph . White took the instrument back to Massachusetts General Hospital , where he set it up in a closet in the basement of a Bulfinch building . There he began taking and studying the ECGs of Americans , men , women and children , eventually compiling records of tens of thousands of patients . <P> Survival Regimen . Although tuberculosis and pneumonia had long been the leading causes of death in the U.S. , heart disease was fast overtaking them . White suggested that a special cardiology service be set up . As he later recalled : " My former teachers and the hospital chiefs warned me that I was entering an insignificant , special field and would never be heard from again . " Undaunted , White expanded his service and research . From detailed studies of patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack not only for weeks or months but for a quarter-century-if he followed the White regimen of weight control using a prudent diet , no smoking and programmed exercise . <P> In 1924 White helped to found the American Heart Association and thereafter became Dr. Cardiology to half a dozen federal health services-and eventually to a large segment of the American public . When President Eisenhower had his first heart attack in 1955 , his personal physicians turned naturally to White as a consultant . Describing the President 's recovery to the press , he spoke freely of the patient 's bowel movements . To many , this was shocking , but White , a sage and proper Yankee , was speaking with a purpose : he was getting across to a mass audience the value of normal body functions as a sign of a cardiac patient 's recovery . White was often accused of sensationalism and publicity seeking , but this candor was his way of promoting the cause of preventive cardiology.                   @ @
