UNEMPLOYMENT in the U.S. no longer means breadlines and deprivation , but the reality of joblessness still brings painful changes to the people who make up the statistics . If unemployment continues long enough , it can often lead to the loss of one 's home or car , to the unpleasant need of relocating in another part of the country , or to personal discouragement . The effects on three typical families : THE MACHINIST . In Seattle , where widespread unemployment creates a here-today , gone-tomorrow mood , the current definition of an optimist is a Boeing worker who brings his lunch to the job . One man who can appreciate that grim joke is Vern Higgins , 44 , a precision machinist at Boeing until last month , when he was laid off after eight years on the job . Higgins grossed $168 a week ; now he collects exactly $168 once a month in state unemployment compensations . From that , Higgins pays $108 on the small suburban house in which he , his wife and their four children live . Utilities and medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other living expenses come out of savings , and soon there will be none left . <P> Higgins has been looking for work in Seattle and Tacoma . " Believe me , " he says , " there 's just nothing in the way of a job . Wherever you go , they wo n't even talk to you most of the time . " At one company , he filled out an application but found that 50 to 75 men had already been there . The Higgins family hopes to keep its house , though Vern says : " I have heard about others with less equity in homes out here who have just walked away from them in the last 30 days . " THE STEELWORKER . " When things started slowing down . I knew I 'd get it , " says Ray Russo , 29 , a veteran of U.S. Steel 's Irvin Works near Pittsburgh . Because of reduced demand for auto-bumpers steel , Russo was dropped down last month from coil feeder to laborer , and his take-home pay was cut from about $135 weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue slip notifying him that he was " furloughed . " He is among the lucky ones . Furloughed workers keep their identification badges and locker keys ; they can be recalled without the red tape of physical examinations and other re-entry procedures that " laid off " workers must go through if they are rehired . <P> Russo 's wife works as a bank teller . His unemployment compensation plus the United Steelworkers ' jobless benefits will add up to as much as his take-home pay as a laborer . " I 've been through this before , " says Russo . " At first it 's like a paid vacation , but then you have too much time on your hands , and you begin to worry . " The most nagging worry : if Russo is off for six months , he will lose Blue Cross coverage . Money pinch or not , Ray Russo has no plans to look for work because that would wipe out unemployment benefits and supplemental compensation . THE SPACE SPECIALIST . Jose Jimenez ( no kin to the Bill Dana comedy character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past seven years at North American Rockwell 's plant in Downey , Calif. , as an Apollo command-module training officer . At 44 , he has enough plaques , awards , citations and pins to wall up a suburban picture window . Last September he was let go as part of an 8% reduction of aerospace and systems employees because of federal budget cuts . " I did n't think it would happen to me , " says Jimenez .
