South Korean President Chung Hee Park , 55 , last week moved to make himself his country 's permanent dictator . In a series of constitutional amendments , which will be submitted to a national referendum later this month , Park proposed several sweeping changes that will enable him to perpetuate his rule as long as he chooses . The move came one week after Park proclaimed martial law , dissolved the National Assembly , outlawed political activities by other parties , imposed tight military censorship , and shut down the universities , the source of his most vocal and persistent opposition . <P> " We have always attempted awkwardly to imitate closely the democratic institutions of others , " Park declared in introducing the amendments last week . " We can no longer sit idle while wasting our precious national power in imitating the systems of others . " He added that the revised constitution " guarantees maximum efficiency in regimenting national strength . " <P> It certainly does that . In fact , it provides all the power that any dictator could desire . Under Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a newly created National Conference for Unification consisting of 2,000 to 5,000 deputies-presumably hand-picked-chosen by small administrative units throughout the nation . There will be no limits on the President 's term of office , such as the one embodied in the present constitution that would have required Park to step down in 1975 . One-third of the National Assembly , moreover , will be appointed by the President ; these , along with his own party 's members , will virtually assure him of a majority at all times . The rest of the National Assembly will be elected by popular vote . <P> As if all this were not enough , Park 's proposed amendments give him the power to dissolve the National Assembly , a prerogative denied the President under the present constitution-though he did , just two weeks ago . He will also be able to declare emergency measures " to temporarily restrict civil liberties " when he deems such action necessary-thus ratifying emergency powers he had already taken last December . <P> The new constitution may give Park as much power as North Korea 's Premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snag into prospects for reunification . The two governments have been holding preliminary negotiations since May , but Park did not change the present constitutional article defining South Korea 's territory as the whole Korean Peninsula and its adjacent islands-thus encompassing North Korea as well . Last week Pyongyang announced that North Korea 's constitution was also being revised " to legally solidify socialist achievements . " <P> Aside from a stiff note of disapproval , Washington has given no indication that it intends to cut off the $240 million in aid slotted for South Korea this year . Within South Korea itself , the opposition seems , at least temporarily , to be lying low ; some have expressed fears that Park might carry out a purge . Economic dissatisfaction is widespread , however , and Park may find it easier to become a dictator than to remain one for as long as he evidently intends .
