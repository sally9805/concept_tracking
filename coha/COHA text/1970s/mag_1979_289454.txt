Executive View <P> <P> One reason for America 's lag in productivity and gap in balance of payments is that the U.S. has lost much of its lead in innovation . Not in a long time have Yankee tinkerers produced an invention to rival nylon or the transistor . U.S. scientists and engineers have brought forth some fascinating new products , including talking toys and maybe the Moodymobile , but the ingenious Europeans and Asians are being granted an ever increasing share of the patents . <P> This deeply troubles John Hanley , a soap supersalesman who rode the Tide to the top at Procter &; Gamble and in 1972 floated over to become chief executive of one of its major chemical suppliers , Monsanto Co . Now Hanley , 57 , is hard-selling a provocative idea : that technology could leap ahead if two basic but often distant institutions would join forces . Those two are U.S. universities and U.S. corporations . <P> In a promising pilot , Hanley 's firm has committed $23 million to a joint project with the Harvard Medical School to find new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Boston and Monsanto 's campus-like home in suburban St. Louis , scientists from the college and the company have been unwinding the secrets of " molecular messengers , " which control the growth of tumors . Besides money , Monsanto , like many another firm , has quite a bit of technical expertise to offer . Says Hanley : " We can , in fact , bring something to the party . " <P> Its own biochemical research has taught Monsanto to manipulate cells . The making of ingredients for simple toothpaste has unlocked some mysteries of dental cavities . Thus the company 's scientists are also working with those at the Harvard Dental School to find ways of controlling diseases of the teeth and gums . <P> Of Monsanto 's Harvard connection , Hanley says , " A lot of people in both education and business are watching this project . Exxon , for example , is looking at it . They have some fledgling arrangements with M.I.T. , and I gather that they want more . There is n't a month that goes by that some paper shuffler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming along ? ' David Rockefeller was in my office a few weeks ago and asked if we could make the same kind of deal with Rockefeller University . " <P> Harvard and Monsanto are aiming at a tough scientific target , but Hanley figures that it is equally significant that they are demonstrating a means for working together to increase the effectiveness of the research under way in U.S. universities . Compared with cash-short colleges , companies have far larger resources to invest in basic research , and they are much more expert in managing that research , directing it to the market and recruiting scientists . " The transferral of technology from the university to the marketplace is a very flawed mechanism in this country , " says Hanley . " It does n't work worth a damn . "
