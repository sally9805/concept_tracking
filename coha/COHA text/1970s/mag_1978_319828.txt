CAPRICORN ONE <P> Directed and Written by Peter Hyams <P> Now that June is here , junk movies are busting out all over . Capricorn One is the first decent one of the lot : it kills two hours with a breathless progression of incredible plot twists and daredevil aerial stunts . Even at its silliest-which is quite silly-this thriller makes The Greek Tycoon seem like a slow yacht to China . At its best , Capricorn One almost matches the trashy highs of Coma , the junk movie of the year to date . <P> The film 's title refers to a NASA mission to send a trio of astronauts ( James Brolin , O.J. Simpson , Sam Waterston - do n't you love it ? ) to Mars . Unfortunately for the astronauts , NASA is headed by a devilish schemer ( Hal Holbrook ) who decides to fake the Mars landing in a TV studio rather than risk failure and a cutoff of appropriations . Predictably , the mad scientist 's plans go wrong , wrong , wrong . Capricorn One turns into a vivid chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a crop-dusting pilot ( Telly Savalas ) and a couple of bloodsucking desert reptiles . <P> Director Peter Hyams ' script does its best to exploit the latest fashions in paranoia . There are interwoven conspiracies and cover-ups ; every U.S. Government official on view is a venal scoundrel . Hyams ' cynical fantasies about the space program are an especially amusing treat . He suggests , with malicious wit , that NASA 'S space walks could actually have taken place on Earth : indeed , he demonstrates that for the price of a video camera and a few buckets of sand , any American can take a giant step for mankind in the privacy of his own home . <P> It 's too bad Hyams did not push himself harder , for Capricorn One could be better . If the film had a few fewer plot holes , a bit more narrative depth and far less signposting dialogue , it might even have been a space-age Manchurian Candidate . A classier cast would also have helped . Gould , Holbrook and Waterston are all in fine , easygoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not big enough stars or good enough actors to make us care about their fates . <P> Even so , the failings of films like Capricorn One are part of the special charm of pulpy summer movies . They should have saggy sections so that moviegoers can engage in such seasonal activities as smooching , scratching sunburn and relieving themselves of beer . For that reason , Capricorn One must be savored before Labor Day - at which point its brief shelf life will run out . <P> - Frank Rich
