THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes andComment THESE are thrilling times for a citizen to he alive in . First : The Surgeon General 's new report , which tells us that because of the baby-sitter 's smoking up the living room with her lemon-and-lime Gauloises we citizens may not be alive as long as we thought we would . Then : Howard Hughes . The Super Bowl . Duane Thomas . Clifford Irving . Is there really a Clifford Irving ? Does the Hughes Tool Company actually exist ? For our part , we like to think of it as a great , beautiful , spooky thing out there in the desert : low buildings with no windows ; strange pipelike structures letting off wisps of gas ; enormous , weird hangars ; something that looks like a dirigible-mooring mast ; men in sunglasses and light-blue suits . The Hughes Tool Company has a telephone number in New York . We phoned.it , or them , as the case may be . We are nut , after all , the sort of magazine that sits around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone rang three times . A lady 's voice answered  --  sounding , in fact , suspiciously like our answering service . " Hughes Tool Company , " the lady said . " Would you care to answer a few preliminary questions ? " we asked . In our kind of work , you do n't just sit there on your end of a phone connection and hear a voice saying " Hughes Tool Company " at you and leave it at that . " Who is it you wish to speak to ? " the voice said . " Doubtless you remember the date of the patenting of the Hughes drill hit ? " we suggested , glancing at our notes . The answer , we knew , was " 1909 . " The real Hughes Tool Company would certainly have the answer . " Hughes Tool Company , " the voice said , " What is the nature of your business ? " " We would like to speak to Mr. Hughes , " we said . It was a brash attempt , we knew  --  putting our cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , or even just happened to be secretly in town and hanging around the switchboard . There is whole literature , after all , on great men hanging around switchboards and rewarding casual callers with sound hits of financial advice . " Mr. Hughes is not here , " the voice said . " When do you expect him ? " we asked . This is the question that always stumps our answering service . " I have other calls , " the voice said . Was there a trace of sadness in the voice ? Memories of the old days ? Of 1909 ? Office parties after the patenting ceremony ? We could hear her ( if , indeed , it was a her ) murmuring " Hughes Tool Company " into the distance . There was not much doubt about the existence of the Super Bowl , however . The Dallas Cowboys . The Miami Dolphins . Dolphins is certainly a cute name for a football team . It is also cute to have a President who takes such an interest in the National Pastime  --  to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass-play suggestions . It was also especially cute to see the military so genially and enthusiastically stirred into the nation 's sports spectacles . First , the Air Force Academy choir sang the national anthem . Then there was much fine marching about on the field by soldiers carrying large American flags . Then there was a fly-by of eight Phantom jets , in an asymmetrical , " missing-man " formation , which was supposedly a reference to the pilots who are missing by reason of being imprisoned in North Vietnam . As the planes whooshed by  --  dark phallic shapes that seemed well suited to this country 's great Locker Room Circus  --  there was a release of balloons . The balloons , we gather , did not represent the souls of faraway people ascending into Heaven , or wherever , as a result of Phantom jets , but then , we imagine , the Super Bowl people were limited as to the number of symbolic pageants they could stage . Practically the only notable thing about the Super Bowl , in fact , was the foolish and rather poisonous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backs , by what is known as the nation 's sports press . Thomas , an exceptionally goal player in his rookie year for Dallas last season , a black , a graduate of a small Texas college , decided at the beginning of this year  --  for reasons that seem to have struck many people in the sports establishment as arrant uppitiness  --  that he should receive more than thirty thousand dollars a year for his services . A certain amount of sports drama then took place : Thomas was suddenly dispatched to the New England Patriots , where he stayed for two days ; he was then returned to the Cowboys , where he has played superbly , hot in virtually total silence , all season . He continued this silence into the Super Bowl . " Thomas Refuses Interviews ! " reported sports story after sports story . It became , finally , a pathetic and an at least slightly brutish spectacle  --  not Thomas but the press . Sports heroes , one gathers , should be docile and content , especially if they are black sports heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black sports hero  --  much praised for his reserve and politeness . " He can run , but he Ca n't hide , " Joe Louis said of Billy Conn . Folk wisdom . The extraordinary- left jab . The impassive face . A model to his race , people said of Joe Louis . Nnt so Cassius Clay , and when he changed his name to Muhammad Ali they really trained that white ringside disdain on him , not even allowing him his name change ( despite the fact that prizefighters have traditionally changed their names ) ? announcers refusing to call him Ali , or else calling him that with an ill-concealed edge of contempt . Uppity . He spoke too much . He spoke too loud . No foot-shuffling . No gentle wisps of folk wisdom . He knew he was good , and said so  --  clearly a dangerous thing for one of our gladiators to do . The danger is not entirely confined to one race , either . Joe DiMaggio , the great center fielder , was reserved and polite , and was generally treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Ted Williams , the great hitter , was brash and outspoken , and was attacked in the press and often berated by his own fans . And now Duane Thomas , who plays football for money , and plays it extremely well , has the uppitiness to think that since the sports establishment does n't do much for him in the way of extra favors , there is no pressing need for him to do extra favors for it . The nation seems now to he obsessed with sports  --  mostly , to he sure , with watching sports f , 0 perhaps it is time to do some shaking up of the sports establishment : the greedy men who , by virtue of strange ninth-century feudal laws , appear to own athletes ; and the inane , prattling , productpushing announcers who lay their heavy thumbprints over double plays and slalom falls and pass interceptions . A good way to start getting us all out of the National Freak Show might be to begin according the likes of Duane Thomas some simple , ungiggl ) regard . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Phantom jets and their beautiful , sexy fly-bys . ? PRESIDENT NIXON 'S announcement that he is withdrawing seventy thousand troops from Vietnam over the next three months is both welcome and a little unfair . What is unfair is that in an election year the President alone can deliver this kind of good news . To achieve equity , the other major candidates should have the right to make troop withdrawals , too , if they wish . Senator Muskie , for example , might want to withdraw even more troops than President Nixon has withdrawn  --  say , between eighty-five thousand and a hundred thousand . Senator McGovern might wan t to withdraw them all . Governor Wallace , on the other hand , might want to put some back . Mayor Lindsay could conceivably withdraw between a hundred and fifty and two hundred thousand fat , prosperous taxpayers from the suburbs and bring them home to New York City .

This , of course , is a popular point to make . During the recent emer-gence of Bangla Desh , al-most every commentator remarked , in one way or another , on the self-de-structive nature of our policy . We not only backed a ruthless dictatorship ( it was said ) but backed an ineffectual ruthless dictatorship . We were not only on the wrong side but on the losing side , too . We defied not just decency but the dictates of power poli-tics . We lost our soul and the world . And all this has been said with equal justice of the entire Indo-China war . One reason this point has been made so often is that it 's easier to accuse the government of failing to accomplish its own ends ( the enhancing of our " pres-tige , " and so on ) than to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everyone likes a chance to appear more hardheaded than the hardheads themselves . ( Some observers , to get extra points in hard-headedness , clearly implied that they would have had no objection to our si-lence about the massacres in East Pakistan if only there had been some advantage for us in it . ) However , there are better reasons for dwelling on this point . A powerful nation that commits terrible crimes itself and con-dones the crimes of other nations in ruthless , single-minded pursuit of its own advantage and it own interests is naturally a menace to the rest of the world , but in our age a nation that does all this in spite of its own interests can be a still greater menace ? particularly if it is a nuclear power , as we are . The world should pray that the nuclear powers , if they ca n't behave with generosity , will at least preserve a lively and accurate sense of their own interests , because their greatest possible interest is also the entire world 's greatest JANUARY 2 9 9 7 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the nuclear powers are indifferent to human life , and arc willing to carry out or condone murder on a huge scale , self-interest becomes the last preserve of hope for the race . Selfishness can lead to great crimes , but it can also keep them within certain bounds . It 's the self-righteous " selfless " crimes that have no limit . Nuclear war , if it conies , wo n't grow out of anyone 's self-interest ( no one has anything to gain ) ? it will grow out of madness . So if the great powers Ca n't honor the lives of people in other parts of the world , one can still hope they 'll learn to cherish their own sweet lives . In Asia , however , we 've been pursuing something that dulls us to the pain we inflict on ourselves as well as to the pain we inflict on our " enemies " ? something that has started to put us to sleep altogether .

Photographer WE put in a call the other day to a man we vastly admire  --  James Van DerZee , who is eighty-five years old , black , and a photographer . We were calling Mr. Van DerZee to congratulate him on his television appearance on the N.E.T . show " Black Journal " last week . Mr. Van DerZee has received quite a hit of attention lately , in belated recognition of the importance of his sixty years ' work as a photographer in Harlem , and we asked him how he was handling it all . " Well , " he answered , in his quiet , courtly voice , " I was at City College the other day , lecturing . I 'm a photographer , ant a lecturer , but they seemed very much interested . Lately , f do n't know what I 'm going to turn into . A month ago , I went to dinner at the millionaires ' yacht club  --  you know , the one on Forty-fourth Street  --  and it was a very nice dinner . " Mr. Van DerZee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metropolitan Museum 's " Harlem on My Mind " show , have been put together into a stunning book , " The World of James Van DerZee " One afternoon , before his television appearance , we met with Mr. Van DerZee to go through his book with him . Despite the recognition recently given his work , the last several years have been difficult for him , and he sometimes describes himself as being in " a state of shock . " Two years ago , he was evicted from the building , on Lenox Avenue , where he had his home and his place of business , and this , he felt , happened because he was deceived by a friend . He now lives , with his wife , in an apartment at Ninety-fourth Street and Amsterdam Avenue , but we met him in the Brooklyn apartment of Reginald McGhee , a young black photographer who is a friend of his and who worked with him on his book . Mr. Van DerZee 's work is a moving record of the lives of many black people  --  in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town of Lenox , Massachusetts  --  and , of course , it is a record of his own life as well . He talked with eloquence about both his life and his work ( " I like to talk about myself , because I know my own life and my own business better than anybody else does , " he said ) , so we just listened . He showed us first a remarkably lovely picture of his first wife , Kate , and their daughter Rachel in Lenox in 1908 . " This picture here was taken up in Lenox by the brook , and this same brook used to lead water to an old mill that stood down on our property , " he said . " That was taken in the spring of the year , in May , and the apple tree was all in blossom , and the bees and the butterflies , they were going from one flower to another . We had a beautiful childhood , as far as I can remember . My parents came to Lenox around 1882 , 1883 . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . My father was General Grant 's butler . There were a lot of questions I should have asked him about that , but I never did . My father was the sexton of the wealthy church in Lenox , the Episcopal church , where the Vander- - hilts and the Frclinghuysens and all the wealthy people went . I used to take pictures of those people and sell them for ten cents apiece . I know of nothing we wanted , except when bicycles were coming out 1 always wanted a bicycle , and I wanted a bicycle so bad it really hurt me . I started to make one , and got as far as the front wheel and the handlebars on it . One day , a wealthy lady came by in a horse and wagon and coachman and so forth  --  Mrs. Morris K. Jesup . She had a big house up on the hill , and she called me up and wanted to know if I liked bicycles , su of course , naturally , my heart jumped up in my mouth ; sure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I guess I did n't talk strong enough , because she never did give me a bicycle .

I have been about twenty-two , I g " Those Indians were schoolteachers at the Whittier School . Those children have got to be in their seventies POW . " I 've been taking pictures since 1900 .

' You see , this twenty-fivecents stuff he did n't bother with he 'd just say , ' Next , next , next , next ' but I 'd take time to pose ' em up . So they 'd act like they wanted me to take their picture . So finally he 'd say , ' Come on in , Jimmy . Set ' em up and take their picture .

FRENCH , DIRECTOR General Services Le Properties Tribute WHEN Woody Guthrie , the most prolific and influential folk singer of his generation , died , in 1967 , after a fifteen-year battle with Huntington 's disease , a group of his friends and relatives organized two memorial concerts  --  one at Carnegie Hall and the other at the Hollywood Bowl  --  and they were both recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Luther King , Jr. , Labor Center , on West Forty-third Street , to celebrate the Long-awaited release of the records , the royalties from which will go to the Woody Guthrie Tribute Fund . There were a few brief speeches ( by Harold Leventhal , Woody 's manager ; by Guy Logsdon , of Tulsa , who has done scholarly research on Woody ; and by Marjorie Guthrie , Woody 's second wife ) , and there was some relaxed group singing , led by Pete Seeger , with Arlo Guthrie , Woody 's twenty-fouryear-old son ; Fred Hellerman , one of the original Weavers ; Oscar Brand , the folk singer ; and Millard Lampell , a writer , who directed both concerts . Most of the people in the room were over forty-five ( Woody 's friends ) or under twenty-five ( the Arlo contingent ) . We recognized one of the over-forty-five guests  --  a stocky , white-haired man  --  as Moses Asch , the founder of Folkways Records . " Woody came to me in 1943 , and I recorded him for THE NEW YORKER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He did five hundred songs for me , and I would estimate that at least a hundred of them have never been released . Eventually , they will be . Woody was an absolutely free soul , and he was often antisocial when the spirit moved him . He would n't put up with anything that might tie him down or that would keep him from expressing himself . " " As you may know , Woody never wrote down the music of his songs , " Al Brockman , a short , cheerful man , said , after telling us that he had published almost all of N.Vcody 's music . " But around 1951 we bought one of the early portable tape recorders and asked him to put his songs down on tape . For a year and a half , he 'd sit and talk or sing into the machine and then type out the lyrics , so we 'd get the words right . From these sources we made sheet-music copies , which we submitted to other artists . Woody 's first big commercial success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's Been Good to Know Yuh ' ? a song about leaving the family homestead during the Depression . His most famous song , ' This Land Is Your Land , ' has sold more than half a million copies over the years . " On the other side of the room , Mrs. Guthrie , a trim , vivacious , gray-haired woman , was tapping one foot to Pete Seeger 's banjo as he played her husband 's music . " Whenever I call people up trying to raise money for my Committee to Combat Huntington 's Disease , I always ask how old they are , " she said . " If they 're under thirty , I say I 'm Arlo 's mother . If they 're over thirty , I say I 'm Woody 's wife . " Toward the end of the party , we found Pete Seeger and Millard Lampell in a reminiscent mood . " In January of 1941 , Mill and I started an amorphous group called The Almanacs with Lee Hays , " said Mr. Seeger , " and in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the Coast . That first week with Woody , we made two albums ? ' Deep Sea Chanteys ' and ' Sod Buster Ballads ' ? which are still being reissued . " " We were the first group to sing urban folk songs , " said Mr. Lampell , a luddy-faced , strong-featured man . " Our audiences were either left-wing ? intellectuals who suddenly felt they had found the real America or hard-nosed union workers who wanted to know whose side we were on . We had a chance to show them when the bus workers struck in 1941 . We met with Mike Quill , of the T.W.U. , and offered to help him organize his people . He said fine , so we sat down that night . , nd wrote ' The Train That Never Returned , ' a ballad about a subway train that roared off into the night with all the city officials on board . " " Maybe we should resurrect that , " said Mr. Seeger , strumming his banjo thoughtfully . " We sang Woody 's songs all across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the man in the corner bar . But his simplification was as purposeful as that of Thoreau 's " " The problem is to keep the mass media from turning Woody into a precious folk hero , " said Mr. Lampell . " He was a man who fought the ? Establishment every day of his life , " said Mr. Seeger . " I saw a football game on TV the other day , and at the half they had little girls dolled up in red-white-andblue bikinis singing ' This Land Is Your Land , ' " said Mr. Lampell . " Now , there 's a song sung by two hundred million Americans , most of whom forget that it was written by a guy who called himself a Communist and wrote a column for the Daily Worker , " said Mr. Seeger . " When Odetta and Arlo sing it together , it 's Woody , " said Mr. Lampell . " Do you remember the verse they use on the record ? " The two men looked at each other for a moment and then sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there And on the sign it said ' No trespassing ' But on the other side It did n't say nothing .
