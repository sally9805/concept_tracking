Editor 's Note : Few writers have the accomplishment or the lifestyle so perfectly attuned to comment on a Scott Fitzgerald as George Frazier . As a Harvard undergraduate , he won the Bowdoin Prize for Literature , the most esteemed award in its field . He sold his first three manuscripts , articles and fiction , to the magazine Vanity Fair , when that publication was the fabulous home base for the most glittering talents of that day . Like Fitzgerald , Frazier also lived in the lofty purlieus of the Hotel Plaza during his stays in New York , as he whirled through a career as fashion authority , social arbiter , and jazz critic . In the latter role , when assailed by dissidents at a Newport Jazz Festival as a " mouldy fig , " George replied in a lengthy speech entirely in Latin , quelling the rabble in " my native tongue . " Frazier 's fourtimes-a-week column in the Boston Globe was recently hailed by Time magazine , listing the ten best newspapers in the United States , as " a continuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He broadcasts over CBS every morning on the news , and in an enduring gesture to the gentility of Boston , reports on the opening baseball game of each season entirely in Latin . The drama of working with George Frazier was not lost during the preparation of this article . Confined to a hospital with cracked ribs and numerous abrasions while the Post deadline expired , he was sedated to the point where he misdirected the manuscript to some long lost address . Ultimately , the article was dictated directly to our typesetters ' premises from the Frazier bed of pain , and thus made this issue with a squeak which Scott Fitzgerald himself would have relished . There is drama in both subject and author . George Frazier makes the point that The Great Gatsby has pervaded our present thought and way of living . As if to prove that , the aware citizens of Nashville , Tennessee , have taken the Scott Fitzgerald era as the theme for their 1974 Swan ball at " Cheekwood , " formerly the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie Cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardens and Fine Arts Center . The photographs accompanying this article were taken at " Cheekwood , " and depict Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Darling Pickslay Cheek , Jr. , recapturing the age of Gatsby in the atmosphere which was their family 's home until 1929 . This drunk ! This deadbeat ! This genius ! The academic advocates of such established classics as The Scarlet Letter and Moby Dick , big bulky sententious books like that notwithstanding , there has lately been growing support for The Great Gatsby 's right to recognition as , if not precisely the greatest American novel , one with few , if any , equals . In the most enlightened and progressive literary circles , Gatsby belongs with Huckleberry Finn , A Farewell to Arms , The Sun Also Rises , Tender Is The Night , Appointment in Samarra , Catcher In The Rye , Ethan Frome , and The Red Badge Of Courage as an American novel that seems to improve with each passing year . Moreover , it has its own mystique , an appeal of such increasing power that now , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencing the lifestyles of practically all of us . I know of nothing else in world literature quite like the Gatsby phenomenon . For one thing , it was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald , the laureate of the Jazz Age , who , when he died of a heart attack in December 1940 , was generally regarded as a failure . Repeating the celebrated line out of Gatsby , Dorothy Parker , when informed of Fitzgerald 's death , said , " The poor son of a b -- - . " Well , the passage of time and heightening of our consciousness have changed all that . A few years ago the Fitzgerald revival had assumed such proportions that Look magazine entitled an article about it " The Poor Son of a B -- - Is n't Poor Anymore . " It 's all so ironic . In his lifetime , poor Scott Fitzgerald was a deadbeat , an ugly alcoholic and a denigrator of his own talent . Forced to write hack movie scripts in order to meet his daughter 's college tuition and his wife 's hospital expenses , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mankiewicz , a Hollywood hand , and the condescension of a marquee lure named Joan Crawford , who , when he was assigned to write a script for her , smiled coquettishly and said , " Write hard . " This , in Arthur Mizener 's haunting phrase , was the far side of paradise  --  the mounting debts , a wife who was insane , the debilitating drinking bouts , a chronic heart condition , the dwindling sales of his books , and  --  yes , the public spectacle . The dazzlingly handsome man of impeccable taste who , with one drink too many , metamorphosed into a rummy  --  that was Scott Fitzgerald 's fall from grace . The other side of paradise began with the publication of his first novel , This Side of Paradise , in March 1920 . This , and his marriage a month later to Zelda Sayre , was the start of the legend  --  the Golden Boy and the beautiful , untamed , and as it turned out , utterly mad Southern Belle . The carryings-on , the high jinks , the unsubtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their roles as apostles of the Jazz Age have made the Fitzge raids part of our more stylish folkways . Unfortunately , in the course of all this , it was generally overlooked that , when sober , Scott Fitzgerald was a writer of magical talent . Though he was a negligent caretaker of his health and purse , he treated his writing gifts with almost sublime respect . Even his potboilers , which were turned out to meet tuition bills or household expenses , betray a deep concern for craftsmanship . But as I 've said , this side of Fitzgerald was not what made him a celebrity . A perfect sentence would go unnoticed by all except admirers of his prose , while the whole of sophisticated New York would be titillated by his and Zelda 's midnight dips in the pool in front of the Plaza . Over the years , there have been other literary legends in America  --  Hemingway , for one , Mailer , for another , and also Hart Crane , and Faulkner and Ken Kesey and Jack Kerouac  --  but Fitzgerald was sui @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wallowing in the gutter , there was a certain fashionable playboyishness to his drunken disorderliness . He carried on with the arrogant indifference to money of a young heir to immense wealth . Actually , except for the first gaudy emoluments of his status as the prophet of the Jazz Age , he was usually poor as a churchmouse  --  but never too proud to beg.Perhaps the most serviceable brief chronology of the main events of Fitzgerald 's life was prepared by the late Andrew Turnbull for his edition of The Letters of F. Scott Fitzgerald . I quote from it with certain observations of my own which I put in italics , a catalog of triumph and lost hope few can match . 1896 , September . Born in St. Paul . The son of a gentleman-type of little get-up-and-go. " 1911 , September . After a couple of years at St. Paul Academy , he entered Newman , a Catholic prep school in New Jersey . 1913 , September .

Beginning of friendship with Hemingway . One could continue with this chronology but bit by bit it becomes almost too depressing to bear . After the reception of The Great Gatsby , Fitzgerald 's career appeared to go steadily downhill . But one can not , in retrospect and in view of the current brouhaha over the movie , overlook the reviews Gatsby received . Mostly the reaction was ecstatic although there were those who had reservations , notably H.L. Mencken . It was unmistakable that a writer of immense stature had arrived . ( The trouble was that success did not become Fitzgerald , and his wife even less . ) Yet it is a characteristic of good books that they are constantly undergoing scene changes , one generation the rage , the next generation completely out of fashion . Gatsby , on the whole , has demonstrated extraordinary staying pow er . Now , with the movie featuring Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Already the bookstores report tripled sales over the past few months . But what the picture will do , bad or good , will have little bearing on the fact that here is a novel rarely matched in the English language for the beauty of its prose and the singular simplicity of its narrative . A good many critics consider it a flawless novel . Indeed it is so perfect a work of art that it seems almost sacrilegious to quote from it , since it is as a whole that it commands our unflagging attention and respect . In the end , of course , the story is always of Fitzgerald and Zelda . This drunk , this deadbeat , this merciless critic of his own gifts , turns out to have been quite possibly the greatest American writer . But unlike others in his profession , he was without the jealousy , the snideness , that characterized , say , a Hemingway . Indeed , Hemingway owed much of his early success to the fact that Fitzgerald constantly promoted him . And yet , when Fitzgerald was ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in a short story . There is something about Fitzgerald that is part Gatsby . because of all American heroes , Jimmy Gatz a/k/a ( as they say about Cassius Clay , " also known as " ) , Jay Gatsby may well be the noblest . Fitzgerald is never known to have done an unkind thing , unless drunk , either to friend or competitor . Considering this , it is providential that the youth of today have taken him as their hero . As a result The Great Gatsby has become more than a mere novel . It has become , almost fifty years after its publication , a way of life among the young . If elegance returns , as some people predict that it will , part of the reason will be the appeal of Gatsby . It is not for nothing that booze is back at college , that the high-Hamilton stiff evening collar is seen at the formal dances at Eastern colleges .

The tomboyish female of recent years is being replaced by the soft Southern Belle type , played with a great deal of skill in the movie by Mia Farrow . The Gatsby legend is n't likely to perish when the movie has had its run . There is too much substance , too much beauty , not to leave a residue .
