GUNNAR JARRING , who is known as " the Silent Swede , " suddenly found himself cornered one day last week by a group of reporters near his office on the 38th floor of the United Nations Secretariat building in Manhattan . Pelted with questions about the Arab-Israeli discussions that he has been summoned to conduct on behalf of U.N . Secretary-General U Thant , the Swedish diplomat recited an aphorism in Hindi , one of a dozen languages that he knows . Then he translated it : " All is all right . " With customary caution , Jarring immediately added , " I mean that only personally . " <P> The situation was beginning to improve professionally , too . To be sure , the Israeli-Egyptian cease-fire remained as tenuous as ever , and Israel continued to accuse the Egyptians of violating the agreement that barred the introduction of new weapons into the 32-mile-wide strip along either side of the Suez . But the truce was more than two weeks old , and it had not been seriously broken by gunfire along the canal . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formulate their bargaining positions . Unless an unforeseen hitch developed , both Israel and Egypt expected the talks to begin this week . <P> American Promises . Israel broke the log jam by notifying Jarring that it was ready to compromise on the formal details of the talks . Originally , the government of Premier Golda Meir favored holding ministerial-level discussions somewhere close to the Middle East , perhaps on Cyprus ; the Egyptians wanted the representatives to be of ambassadorial rank and the site to be New York . Israel finally agreed to New York meetings and said that the preliminary sessions could be handled by ambassadors . As its part of the bargain , the Israeli Cabinet was expected to nominate U.N . Ambassador Yosef Tekoah as its representative . But when the talks reach substantive issues , the negotiating rank probably will be upgraded to the ministerial level . By then , the foreign ministers of the countries involved are scheduled to be in New York attending the U.N . General Assembly , which convenes Sept. 15 . <P> Israel 's decision to compromise on negotiation arrangements eased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet-Egyptian support that made the ceasefire possible , U.S. diplomats complained that Israel protested far too loudly about the alleged truce violations . Israel became anxious that the U.S. was hedging on its promise to maintain Israeli military superiority in the Middle East . The Israelis took particular offense at Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird 's remark that the U.S. possessed better intelligence than Israel .
