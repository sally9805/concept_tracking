When Archbishop Makarios , the bearded political and religious leader of Cyprus , visited Athens last January , Greek Strongman George Papadopoulos warned him : " Your Beatitude , you should be careful . Your safety is in danger . " Makarios nodded knowingly ; only recently , he confided , a foreign diplomat had told him that an assassination attempt was to be made when he returned to his troubled island . " And what did you do ? " asked Papadopoulos . " I did n't pay attention , " Makarios replied . <P> He should have . Last week , bound for a monastery 30 miles away to celebrate Mass , Makarios strapped himself inside the presidential helicopter just outside his palace in Nicosia . When the silver-and-white chopper reached rooftop level , automatic gunfire spat out from a high school across the street , riddling the craft . Makarios was uninjured , but the pilot , Army Major Zacharias Papadoyiannis , 38 , was wounded seriously in the abdomen . Nonetheless , though he grazed a tree as he swung desperately from the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a 12-ft. by 12-ft. open square . Then , mumbling , " Forgive me . Your Beatitude , but I am wounded , " Papadoyiannis crawled out of the cockpit and collapsed . <P> Makarios , his robes smeared with the pilot 's blood , pronounced a blessing over him at the hospital , then went on to preside at the appointed Mass . That evening , addressing his nation in a calm but sorrowful voice , he declared : " If the bullets did not strike my body , they struck and wounded my soul . " <P> Still Vulnerable . Suspicion immediately centered on several Greek extremist organizations that stubbornly refuse to accept any political solution for the divided island short of enosis ( union with Greece ) . Makarios has firmly expressed his belief in independence for both the Greek Cypriot majority of 490,000 and the Turkish Cypriot minority of 110,000 . Moreover , the military regime in Athens has formally abandoned the idea of enosis . Despite such opposition , extremists in recent months embarked on a new campaign of terrorism . <P> After the assassination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cypriots suspected of belonging to gun-packing private armies such as the National Front . By week 's end , however , at least six had been released . Police also searched the home of former Interior Minister Polycarpos Georgadjes , one of Makarios ' political opponents , and announced that they had found two pistols . Despite Georgadjes ' claim that they had been gifts from Makarios in friendlier days , he was fined $384 for illegal possession . Meanwhile , Makarios ' attempted assassins apparently remained on the loose , leaving the archbishop-and his volatile land-as vulnerable to danger as ever .
