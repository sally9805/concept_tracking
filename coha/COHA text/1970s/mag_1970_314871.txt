Violent political demonstrations are a phenomenon that only rarely visit the drowsy , sylvan Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh . They have been directed against foreign embassies there only three times in memory-once against the British and twice against the Americans . Last week , six years to the day after Cambodian demonstrators attacked the American embassy in Phnom Penh to protest the U.S. presence in Southeast Asia , mobs once again rampaged through the city . This time , however , their targets were the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong embassies . <P> Careful Turnaround . The demonstrations began in the eastern-border province of Svay Rieng , long a vital refitting and recuperation base for Communist troops operating in South Viet Nam . Three days later , they spread to the capital as thousands of placard-carrying , student-age protesters attacked the North Vietnamese embassy , tossing furniture through doors and windows , and setting fire to several official cars . At the Viet Cong embassy , windows were smashed , doors were torn from their hinges , and the lawn was strewn with debris . The demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The trouble broke out two months after Cambodia 's chief of state , Prince <P> Norodom Sihanouk , left for treatment in France of a blood ailment .

With an estimated 40,000 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops in Sihanouk 's country , many of them protecting the southern terminus of the Ho Chi Minh Trail , Hanoi is certain to be alarmed by any threat to its Cambodian sanctuary . <P> In Sihanouk 's absence , the government has been run by Premier Lon Nol , formerly a top-ranking general , and by Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak , the Deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consolidate their own power by carrying the policy of coolness toward Hanoi and the Viet Cong farther than Sihanouk would wish . When informed of the riots , the Prince accused " certain personalities " of trying to throw Cambodia " into the arms of an imperialist capitalist power . " He warned that he could be toppled by a right-wing coup .
