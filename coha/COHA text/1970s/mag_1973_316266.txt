For the first time since the military junta seized power and imposed martial law six years ago , Greece has been rocked by political protests . Surprisingly , the demonstrations were organized and led by Greek university students , who have until recently been considered the most passive and timid in Europe . " I smell the fresh breath of spring , " exclaimed Opposition Leader John Zighdis , a former Cabinet Minister who was imprisoned for a year and a half by the colonels . " This will lead to the destruction of tyranny and the downfall of the dictatorship . " Retorted the government spokesman , Byron Stamatopoulos : " The student problem is like a mosquito sitting on the horn of a bull . " <P> The truth lies somewhere in between . What is certain is that the regime of George Papadopoulos has been shaken by the students , on whom it has lavished free tuition , spanking new schools , and even free meals . A good many of them , however , now feel that such material benefits are not enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed by their European counterparts . Thus , students at Athens ' elite Polytechnic Institute boycotted classes last month after the government announced that it planned to upgrade the status of the so-called " sub-engineers . " These , in effect , are second-class students who follow a simpler curriculum than do regular engineers and are subject to certain professional limitations after they graduate . ( For example , they can build a house no taller than two stories . ) <P> This fairly parochial protest might have died down in a few days , but a government official ( no one is certain who ) sent squads of policemen to the campus to break up a meeting on the sub-engineer problem . Outraged by this " violation " of the university , students began taunting the cops with cries of " Fascists ! " and " Gestapo ! " For good measure , some also threw in two peculiarly Greek insults : pustis , meaning the passive partner in a homosexual relationship , and malakas ( masturbator ) . <P> The police responded by beating and dragging off a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " insulting authority . " Eight were later found guilty and given eleven-month suspended sentences . <P> In an attempt to forestall further demonstrations , the government enacted a new law that empowered the army to rescind the draft deferments of any student who boycotted classes . The law only spurred more protests . Strikes and demonstrations spread to the University of Athens and to the Aristotelian University of Salonika to the north . The students have called a temporary truce , but another mass rally is scheduled for this week . If the government does not back down , warns one student leader , " we will come down the streets .
