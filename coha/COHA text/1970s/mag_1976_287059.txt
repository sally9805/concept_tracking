Native-born peregrine falcons-not plentiful even when they were thriving - had not been seen in the skies over the Eastern U.S. for some 20 years . But now this fierce , graceful bird of prey , driven to the brink of extinction by DDT , * appears to be making a comeback . Ornithologist Tom Cade and his colleagues at Cornell University have succeeded in breeding peregrines in captivity and releasing them in the wild , where they can once again be seen soaring to great heights before diving on their prey at speeds of up to 200 m.p.h . <P> The Cornell program to boost the peregrine population got started in 1970 . But it was not until 1973 that the ornithologists working at Cornell 's " hawk barn " got chicks from captive birds to survive , and not until 1975 that they began regularly releasing peregrines into the wild . Last year Cade placed 16 peregrines-offspring of birds trapped in Canada and Alaska and mated in captivity-in artificial eyries in Massachusetts , New York , New Jersey and Maryland . This summer he hopes to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release enough young birds so that the peregrine can re-establish itself in the East and breed naturally , now that there is a near-total U.S. ban on DDT . <P> Capturing the wild birds , which tend to nest on cliffs and other towering places , is no easy trick . And breeding the falcons and returning their offspring to nature are even more difficult . So that peregrine chicks will think of their new man-made eyries as natural homes , they must be placed while they are still flightless-and thus most vulnerable to predators . Great horned owls , the peregrine 's major natural enemy , killed two of the birds released in New York State last year . One was electrocuted when it lighted on a high-voltage transformer . <P> Odds should be better for four-month-old birds placed atop a tower in New Jersey 's Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge earlier this month . Two amateur falconers , Daniel Hays and Edward Howard , both 24 , are living in a tent near the tower and keeping an eye on the nesting box .

Then , to learn more about the falcons ' habits after they begin hunting on their own , Hays and Howard will track them by means of tiny radio transmitters attached to the birds ' tail feathers . <P> Promising Prospects . Cade and New Jersey officials who have helped sponsor the peregrine program hope that the birds will adapt quickly to life in the refuge . The prospects seem promising . Two falcons released a few miles to the north near Barnegat Inlet last summer disappeared during the winter but returned to the Jersey shore this summer . Equally encouraging , birds bred in captivity have mated this year and begun raising families of their own . <P> Most important , the falcons seem determined to survive , even to the extent of taking advantage of the civilization that nearly wiped them out . One of the four birds released last year on Carroll Island in Chesapeake Bay later took up residence on a bridge tower near Annapolis . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Baltimore . There , like sharpies everywhere , they were preying on pigeons . <P>
