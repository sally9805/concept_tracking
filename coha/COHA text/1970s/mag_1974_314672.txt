In the work of Gustave Moreau . . . des Esseintes saw , realized at last , the strange and superhuman Salome he had dreamed of . . . the accursed Beauty , marked out from all others by the catalepsy which stiffened her flesh and hardened her muscles ; the monstrous Beast , indifferent , unresponsive , unfeeling and , like Helen in antiquity , poisoning everyone who came near her . . . <P> <P> Perhaps no living painter has ever been thrust into such notoriety by a novel as Moreau was by the publication of J.K. Huysmans ' manifesto of decadence , A Rebours , in 1884 . Moreau was then 58 , a Parisian born and bred , praised in the salon , an officer of the Legion of Honor , a mature and respected figure with a strong academic bias . The fictional hero of A Rebours , that absurd purple monster des Esseintes , was described as owning two of his paintings . One was the elaborate Salome Dancing Before Herod , 1876 ( see color page ) . <P> Ideal Somnambulism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron saint of dandyism and decadence , the father of symbolist art . His canvases , exotic in their spurts and blooms of color , are populated by pale androgynous youths and languid women encased , like scarab beetles , in glittering carapaces of emerald and embroidery . Such pictures were hailed as setting the tone of an entire sensibility-the same cast of imagination that in literature ran from Flaubert 's Salammb to Swinburne and Wilde , heavy with allusions to enigmatic and castrating Fatal Women . Moreau 's own work was rich in homosexual overtones , though in fact he kept up a continuous liaison with a woman named Adelaide-Alexandrine Dureux for 25 years . <P> Moreau felt he was lionized for the wrong reasons . " One has never seen such a mania for the invisible , " he jotted grumpily , " such exclusive addictions to dream , mystery , mysticism , symbolism and the undefined . " Under the circumstances it seems ironically right that three-quarters of a century after he died of stomach cancer in Paris , Moreau should now be having his first American retrospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . Composed of 88 oils , water-colors and drawings , it has been assembled by Art Historian Julius Kaplan for the Los Angeles County Museum . <P> Moreau was Matisse 's teacher , but he is not an artist who fits into the formalist canons of " modernism . " Indeed , for 50 years it has been de rigueur to reject his work as florid and sickly , despite its demonstrable influence on surrealism and its frequently astonishing beauty . That beauty , however , is not in the structure ; his nymphs have a way of looking like Delacroix houris , but boned , and one may look in vain-except in the hundreds of tiny and miraculously spontaneous oil sketches and color notes that fill the Muse Moreau in Paris-for that dynamism that animated Moreau 's romantic predecessors , Delacroix and Chassriau . Rather , it is a delight of surface . To fix it , Moreau resorted to what he called the " beauty of inertia . " He noted of Michelangelo , whom he adored : " All these figures seem fixed in a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make . " Once immobilized , the figures in his allegorical paintings-Oedipus , Salome and the like-could then be loaded with accessories , encrusted with redundant decoration .
