A DOLL 'S HOUSE by HENRIK IBSEN <P> Anticipation proves to have been the best part of Liv Ullmann 's Nora . She is giving a middling performance in a self-indulgent vanity production . Stardom is a powerful narcotic which , like pride , has frequently preceded a fall . <P> Perhaps there should be a talent-depletion allowance for actors and actresses who linger too long in films . In any event , the stage makes different demands , and in the present instance Ullmann is simply not up to them . This is not entirely her fault . Her marvelously expressive face and luminous blue eyes perform exquisite miracles in camera closeups . In the vast spaces of Lincoln Center 's Vivian Beaumont Theater these precious attributes , and their power to move , are lost . <P> As to flaws , Ullmann has a thin voice with a narrow , monotonous range . In a Bergman film , with its still , deep pauses , this is not immediately apparent , but onstage it becomes a cumulative irritant . Ullmann 's English is good , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little squirrel " imagery of the play literally , she skitters about the stage like a sandpiper . This does not destroy Nora 's coquettishness , but it certainly diminishes it . There seems to be an arbitrary rhetoric of motions with which Ullmann plays the role . When she fears that her husband Torvald ( Sam Waterston ) will discover her secret dealings with the malignant moneylender Krogstadt ( Barton Heyman ) , she makes the panicky gestures of a heroine in a silent-movie melodrama . When she reads the riot act to Torvald prior to slamming the famous door , she sits as motionless as a pillar of ice . Presumably , this translates as " frozenly adamant . " <P> Here we are at the core of Ullmann 's misconception of the role . Her Nora does not grow toward self-awareness or strive for emancipation ( as Claire Bloom 's so affectingly did a few seasons ago ) . Instead , she simply seems to assert herself by different methods . Thus there is no sense of either exhilaration or poignance in her departure . <P> The supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nora buckles . Still , this cast might be sued for nonsupport . With no trace of a guiding hand from Norwegian Director Tormod Skagestad , the players appear to be introducing themselves to each other at first rehearsal . As Torvald , Waterston is a mildly ruffled porcupine who can be dequilled instantly by Ullmann . Petty or not , Torvald should be a visible tyrant . After all , Nora is not slamming the door at middle-level management , but at the historic tyranny of convention . <P> As the man who triggers the mechanics of the play by making a secret loan to Nora and then writing her husband a letter about it , Krogstadt should be ominous . Yet Heyman merely huffs and puffs like a March wind . Dr. Rank , Nora 's platonic admirer , is dying of hereditary syphilis and is in considerable agony . No one has apparently mentioned this to Michael Granger , who plays the doctor as if he were an aging boulevardier with a head cold . <P> Though it is an aesthetic dud , A Doll 's House is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineered it that way by settling for star power . This is faintly amusing considering his long and loud castigations of Broadway commercialism . Too bad he did n't consult a Broadway producer before casting the play . T.E.Kalem
