On the feast of St. Nicholas in 1273 , Italian Dominican Friar Thomas Aquinas entered a chapel in Naples to say Mass before beginning a day of lecturing and writing . During the Mass , something profound happened to him : some kind of physical or nervous breakdown , perhaps accompanied by an overpowering mystical vision . Afterward , he ceased dictating his theological masterwork , the Summa Theologiae . " All that I have written , " he explained to concerned friends , " seems to me like straw compared to what has now been revealed to me . " He never wrote another line . Three months later-700 years ago last month-he died in a monastery on the way to a church council at Lyon . <P> He was 49 , and the author of more than 40 thick volumes of philosophy and theology so harmonious to Catholic teaching that he became known as " the Angelic Doctor . " This year Protestants and Roman Catholics alike are marking the seventh centenary of Thomas ' death with a sympathetic reassessment of his writings . <P> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roman Catholic thought , a man so revered that he was the only philosopher actually named in the church 's 1918 code of canon law . The code declared that his " method , doctrine and principles " were to be the foundation of every priest 's philosophical and theological training . Brilliant Neo-Thomists like the French philosophers Jacques Maritain and Etienne Gilson had given Thomism a modern relevance . University of Chicago Philosopher Mortimer ( The Great Books ) Adler considered Aquinas to be one of the foremost molders of Western thought . In many Roman Catholic colleges , students got heavy doses of Thomism ; later philosophical giants like Descartes , Hume and Kant were only mentioned for their errors . <P> Font of Truth . Catholic Theologian David Tracy , writing in a recent issue of the Christian Century , recalls the period somewhat ruefully : " Has Einstein spoken ? Fine , but really-if you look hard and long enough , it 's all there in Aquinas . Are you looking for an aesthetic or political theory . . . applicable to the modern situation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary theology ? Master the Summa Theologiae and the Summa Contra Gentiles . " Even before the Second Vatican Council , some progressive Catholic theologians were abandoning the kind of worshipful Thomism Tracy describes . After the council had ushered in a new spirit of intellectual freedom in the 1960s , Thomas ' fall into disfavor accelerated . His structured philosophy was criticized as too static , his rationality rejected for lacking the insights of existentialism . This year , at one typical U.S. Catholic seminary-St . Joseph 's in Yonkers , N.Y.-only one course specifically offers studies in the work of Thomas Aquinas.
