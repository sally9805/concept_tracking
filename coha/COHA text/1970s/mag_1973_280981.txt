By any reckoning , Joan Mir is probably the greatest living painter , at least of the generation that produced Picasso , Matisse , Gris and Dali . Amidst these driven men , Mir was always the elf , an antic poet who took Surrealism and made it gay , an irreverent abstractionist who planted sexual symbols in wide fields of indeterminate space . He is already so enshrined in art history that it is easy to assume that he is dead . But Mir is alive , and at 80 has taken off in a new creative direction . <P> He found inspiration about four years ago when he walked into a Barcelona gallery and saw some tapestries - " hangings , " in the current vernacular - by a young Spaniard called Josep Royo . They were insouciant works , with various objects sticking out of the wool . Mir decided at once that with Royo he could and would create a new style , in a career that has had many styles . He sought out the young man , told him briskly : " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break traditional molds . " In the next years , the two worked in close collaboration . Every few weeks , Mir traveled from his house in Majorca to Royo 's studio , a converted flour mill in Tarragona , outside Barcelona . There Royo would spread his newest tapestries on the floor . Mir studied each , with all its intricate twists , sworls , braids and tailings . Then he might splash a design across the rhythmic shapes , or snatch up some scrap of cloth to provide an accent or an assertion , using material from among the detritus lying around the studio . These were appliqud into the tapestry itself . <P> Humble Burlap . For one tapestry , Mir picked up a metal stencil for the letter G and splashed it on upside down in brown against bright yellow canvas . Then he hung the stencil itself on the fabric-also upside down . A handy whisk broom was slapped onto another tapestry . Working on a third , Mir 's eye lit upon an empty paint bucket ; he rammed it into the composition then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint made of canvas . He proposed scorching certain areas to darken the hemp , and soon the studio flared with gouts of kerosene fires , quickly lit then doused . <P> He told Royo where to add a canvas patch , where to drape a cascade of wool , where to drop coils of fishermen 's rope . Says Mir : " Wool and weaving give me a great sensual feeling . " Agrees Royo : " When he picks up a skein of wool , he closes his eyes to feel it , and cries , ' C'est formidable ! ' " <P> The result was a series called Sobreteixims , now on exhibit at Manhattan 's Pierre Matisse Gallery . All the name means is " on top of tapestry . " The craft of tapestry is as old as palaces , as durable as moths will allow . But the collaboration of a young crafts man and a modern-day old master have transformed it into something bold and new . Bright color plays against the hemp 's rich browns , big shapes against the intricacy of woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Formidable .
