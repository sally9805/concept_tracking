One reason that economists can differ sharply over whether the U.S. is in a " recession " is that there is no simple , numerical definition of the term . Herbert Stein , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , offers a qualitative description : " An extended , substantial and widespread decline in aggregate economic activity , but one less severe than earlier ' depressions . ' " The job of determining just which downturns belong in that category has fallen to the National Bureau of Economic Research , whose word on the subject is practically law in the profession . <P> The NBER has classified five post-World War II business contractions as recessions . No single standard determines that judgment , but the five drops do have some common denominators . Each lasted at least nine months , during which real G.N.P . fell at least 1.5% and industrial production dropped a minimum of 8.1% . Also , the jobless rate rose at least 2.3 percentage points , to 6.1 % or more , and employment declined in more than 80% of the 30 major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , the current downturn has lasted roughly three months , and no figures are yet available on what has happened to real G.N.P.Industrial production has dropped 1.4% , the jobless rate has risen six-tenths of a percentage point , to 5.2% , and employment has declined in about 20% of the nonfarm industries . So , by NBER standards , the U.S.is not yet in a recession-though it could enter one later .
