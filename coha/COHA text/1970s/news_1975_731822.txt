txt Coast Guard specialists late Monday still were unable to contain a huge oil slick caused by a runaway barge that slammed into a rock breakwater and spread about 10,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil along four miles of Milwaukee coast line . Hampered by the icy , choppy waters of Lake Michigan until fate in the day , workers finally were able to board the 280 - foot oil barge that ran aground at the breakwater 1,000 feet from shore at the south end of Milwaukee . The barge , owned by Hannah Inland Waterways Corp . of Lemont , Ill. , was being towed by a tug from Chicago to Milwaukee Sunday night , when the towing cable parted in rough water 11/2 miles from the entrance to the Milwaukee harbor . THE 150-FOOT tug boat , under the command of Capt . Richard Marone , searched for the drifting barge thruout Sunday night but was unable to locate it in the dark . Wind-lashed waves of 10 and 12 feet further hampered the search . The barge was carrying 672 , - 000 gallons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11:30 a.m . Monday after it apparently had been washed onto the breakwater just south of Milwaukee 's South Shore Yacht Club . By that time , the escaping No. 5 grade fuel oil had spread over almost two square miles of water like a thin layer of black-strap molasses . During the day special containment " booms " were strung across the common mouth of the Milwaukee , Kinnickinnic , and Menominee Rivers and at strategic points inside the breakwater to trap the slick . The booms are long strings of rubber or plastic floats with fins that hang in a two-foot skirt below the waterline to keep the slick from spreading . HOWEVER , IT.was virtually impossible to surround the whole slick with the booms , and by evening much of the oil had dissipated out into the lake . Coast Guard authorities designated the accident a major spill and called in the Atlantic Strike Team of oil spill experts from Elizabeth City , Because of the prevailing winds which had been blowing the slick toward the shore and inside the breakwater , authorities had hoped to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps by Monday night . However , as the sun went dawn the wind changed direction and Coast Gua rd officials said that pumping could n't start until Tuesday morning . MEANWHILE , members or the Strike Team who boarded the barge reported that some of the leak had been stopped and only two of the five oil-containing compartments on the vessel had been punctured . anna In , officials have arranged to bring an empty barge from Chicago in hopes of transferring the remaining oil to it Tuesday morning . The oil slick was not expected to harm Milwaukee 's bathing beaches , but the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said some of the 4,000 water fowl who winter in the area could be rendered helpless if oil soaked into their feathers . In a press conference Monday , Comdr . Earle Sullivan , the Coast Guard 's on-the-scene coordinator of the containment operation , said the main cleanup should be completed in two or three days . He said there was no danger to the Milwaukee water supply . Under the law , the Hannah Corp . can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expenses of the cleanup . Sullivan said normal cleanup costs run about $3 per gallon .
