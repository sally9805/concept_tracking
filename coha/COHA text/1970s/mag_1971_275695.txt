While some mass circulation magazines are having their troubles , with advertisers if not readers , specialty magazines are springing up all over , aimed at particular regions , races or interests . A sampling of newcomers : <P> BLACK SPORTS is a 50 monthly dedicated to providing depth and dimension to the coverage of black athletes- " something beyond salary figures and statistics , " in the words of Publisher Allan Barren , a bush-bearded black from New Jersey who once ran a computer company . The first issue adds little to the public 's considerable knowledge of such obvious star subjects as pro basketball 's Lew Alcindor and Oscar Robertson and football 's Matt Snell . But Barren hopes to develop other healthy heroes for young blacks , who , he claims , " now identify only with guys on the block , like pimps and pushers . " Because he could not find a qualified black to serve as editor , Barren appointed a white friend , Freelancer Joseph Hemingway , to head an otherwise all-black editorial staff . <P> SEXUAL BEHAVIOR , a $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to authoritative information about sex " and appears to be inspired by the successful Psychology Today . Its editor , Dr. Harold Lief , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School , feels that " Americans are estranged from sexuality . They are ashamed of their desires . " Despite such spicy cover come-ons as " 57 Reasons a Wife May Decline Sex " and " Are We a Nation of Breast Worshipers ? " . Sexual Behavior seems almost ashamed of its subject . Most of the articles are by M.D.s and Ph.D.s and so mustily mid-Victorian in style and tone that educated adults will not discover much they did not find out about in schoolyard bull sessions as kids . <P> ON THE SOUND is the brainchild of Editor Roy Rowan , a former assistant managing editor of LIFE . A slick monthly that sells for $2 , it is aimed at the 4,000,000 people who live on or near Long Island Sound . " Our readers are genuinely affluent , educated people , " Rowan says , " who share a certain location and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of leisure and concerned ecology , stressing to Sound dwellers the joy of sailing on it or swim ming in it and the horrors of bilge-blowing tankers befouling it . <P> AUDIENCE is a hard-cover bimonthly that virtually commands affluence from its readers . It costs $4.95 a copy and is a melange of Esquire and Horizon , with the flair of the long-dead peekaboo Flair . Book adaptations and artsy photographic portfolios are mixed with nonfiction articles that seem to have a very limited audience indeed . Example : " How I Rode with Harold Lewis on a Diesel Freight Train Down to Gridley , Kansas , and Back , " which turns out to be exactly that .
