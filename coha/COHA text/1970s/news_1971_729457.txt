txt Pakistan 's President Yahya Khan is expected to announce a transfer of power to politicians in the rebellious east wing of his country when he visits Dacca , its capital , early next month . He is evolving a working arrangement with a group that includes compliant second-rung politicians from the Awami League . These men did not join the breakaway Bangla Desh government announced by the resistance movement last month . They surrendered to the Army after military action began following the breakdown of talks between President Yahya and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman , the Awami League leader . Since then East Pakistan has been under a military governor , Gen. Tikka Khan . When asked a few days ago by reporters whether there would be a transfer of power , the Pakistani President replied : " Who is there to receive it ? " A modified form of autonomy for the east wing now will probably be handed over to the " reasonable men " he had hoped to discover at the time he started military action . Greater job opportunities will be given to East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus reducing their list of grievances . The Pakistani President also hopes that the new move will appease the United States , which has been pressing him for some political accommodation to help it ' continue with its aid program .
