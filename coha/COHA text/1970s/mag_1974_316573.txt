Motion ? It is not the first word to come to mind when one looks at the ritual masks , figures and fetishes in the show called " African Art in Motion " now on display in Washington , D.C. Locked in the National Gallery 's glass cases , chastely spotlighted , such objects are seen by the Western eye as immobile , like any other sculpture . <P> In a symbolic sense they have been frozen still more by Western art history , which has tended to interest itself in African art only to the extent that it was cannibalized by Picasso , Braque , Brancusi and other European artists , becoming a font of style for cubism and expressionism . This helped Europeans see it as " real " art , instead of mere curios or portable anthropological data . Still , the stereotype must be got rid of before African art can be understood in relation to its original audience . <P> All African visual art issues from cultures permeated by the dance .

Art Historian Robert Thompson , in showing these works drawn from the superb African collection owned by Katherine White in Los Angeles , demonstrates the canons of African motion across the diversity of regional cultures : Dan and Dogon , Yoruba and Ogoni , Luba and Ashanti , Benin and Ejagham . <P> Western ideas of form and psychological theories of " body language " are inadequate to deal with African imagery , though it has something to do with both . A European is apt to seek the meaning of a work like the modern Ashanti wood carving of a mother and child from Ghana in its harmony of shapes : the massive , fluid bulges of hair , the delicate formal rhyme between the points of nose , chin and conical breasts , and so forth . But when Thompson showed it to an African , his response to what seemed " universal " in the sculpture was quite different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child . She secures his body with the other hand . She is sitting well , like a person of character . " And this quality of presence , of being " purely there , " extends itself through a language of moral posture . <P> Just as sitting suggests permanence , calm and repose , so the act of balancing - as seen in the Yoruba " Gelede " masks with animals riding their heads and in the figures on houseposts or columns - indicates a harmonious equilibrium with the world and its spirit forces . Kneeling " conveys belief that life demands the beautiful giving of the self to persons of honor . " A standing posture implicitly suggests power , life , fortitude , kingliness-as in ( amid a host of other examples ) the sacred fetishes of Zaire , wooden figures into which tribesmen ceremonially hammer nails as a proof of moral integrity ; the fetish , they believe , will kill any evil-spirited person who adds a nail to it .                 @ @ @ @
