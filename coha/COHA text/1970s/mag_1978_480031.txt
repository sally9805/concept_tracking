OF THE THREE-HUNDRED-ODD books that had accumulated for me when I began this re- view ? an average number in recent years ? a few , as usual , could be set aside at once : the weak , ill-conceived , the downright bad . But not so the mass . Dutifully I slogged through book after book of good poetry , intelligent , concerned , well-written , poetry adequate to experience and faithful to aesthetic standards ? and as exciting as a dish of canned peas . Put it to the summer heat ( in which I have been working ) , or jaded sensibility , or whatever you wish : one point nevertheless remains , Change in literary circumstance requires a change in critical response . For years , trying to be helpful , I have sought out and reviewed little-known poets and the publications of small presses , and have become somewhat known as a person who does this , with consequences not altogether expedient to myself . Sometimes , perhaps too often , I have been easy in my judgments . Now I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if , through our expanding cultural mechanisms , our subsidized publications , grants and fellowships , university writing programs , workshops , and so on , we could create a sufficiently big agglomeration of good poetry , then excellence would be bound to arise from it , like bubbles from sourdough . We should have known better . The good never goes beyond itself . It does not ferment ; it stops short and conforms ; it solidifies into a corn-mon style and attitude ; it just sits there . No , excellence comes not from the mass but from the fringe , or from somewhere else altogether ? a place never heard of by 99 percent of the younger poets in the country , remembered , apparently , only by their elders . Consequently I have chosen four books from the mass to write about , a radical reduction . Three seem to me genuinely excellent . The fourth misses by only a little , though that little is worth discussing . B ASIL BUNTING , the Northumberland poet who began writing in the Twenties , has most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat comical name . Years ago he was praised by Ezra Pound , and more recently has been admired and promoted by others , but not by many ; at least not in America , though I think generally not in England either . He has been almost a cult figure . And I confess I am no better than the rest because until now I had read only one of his major poems , " Briggflats , " and a few smaller ones in anthologies and magazines . I wonder how I was so obtuse . The poetry is marvelous . It should have sent me scurrying to find all his productions . Now his Collected Poems has been brought out by Oxford University Press in both England and America , which I suppose is as strong a sign as we could expect that Bunting has " arrived . " I imagine he is smiling , if wryly . He seems a gentle man in his poems , yet lively , too , and life-giving , very original , perceptive , learned , genHayden Carruth is poetry editor of Harper's. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , human or other . He knows things are not what they should be , and he stops short of forgiveness , as any intelligent man must ; but he makes allowances , as any wise man will . His best-known poem is " I3riggflats , " named after the place where he lives , a longish , rambling , semiautobiographical poem in short-line measure , full of imageries of moorland and ocean , croft and harbor , but with excursions abroad , too , or backward into history . He writes a which is his own self-prescription . He " paints " too , of course ? those imageries I spoke of ? but the tune , the harmony of voices , is what stays as the words flow : cadences , syntax woven against the line . the modulations of sound , and above all the play of thought and feeling in their concrete embodiments : It 's true . Read it three times , and say if it is n't . Poetry is " sensuous things " informed by " thought , " i.e. , moral concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out singing , and that means loving . It is true , certainly , of Bunting 's poetry , even when he is cross or bitter . He has in his ear the precisely right combination of hearings : modern speech in all its many usages , his own antique Northumbrian dialect , the poetic language of the ages . The combining , which is his innate gift , is poetry of a high order indeed . The Collected Poems is short , only 160 pages to convey fifty years ' work . One feels that it has been as carefully pruned as the individual poems themselves . Tonally and thematically , it is a varied collection , yet utterly unified by the continuing presence through the years of the poet 's own consciousness . Comparisons arise , of course , with Pound , Eliot , Zukofsky , David Jones , or others , but though they may be historically unavoidable they are otherwise invidious and should be ignored . Basil Bunting is his own poet , as strong and independent as any of the others , and his book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a long , long time . 1 SAY THE SAME with equal fervor of Adrienne Rich 's book The Dream of a Common Language , though it and Bunting 's are as different as two books of poetry could he . 1 have known Rich 's work for years , have liked it immensely , have watched it mature with a steady , personal directedness that is rare . Consequently 1 am not surprised that her new book is her best . Beyond that , it is important , both poetically and thematically , to our general human evolution , especially because in the work itself these two elements , poetry and theme , can not be separated . Here is a new awareness totally assimilated to timeless aesthetic procedures . This would be rare at any time ; now it is unique . The new poems spring from the same locus of thought and feeling that has generated Rich 's recent polemical writing , particularly her book Of Woman Born , which has stimulated so much discussion since it appeared a couple of years ago . But whereas I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hysteria , that rather spoiled the whole effect , the poems are firm , assured , calm . They are reasonable ? to draw the distinction between rationality and reason that Camus made years ago ? and that is what counts in poetry . They are true to the poet 's vision . I do n't know if Rich 's radical feminist ideology contains mechanisms that might be made to account for this difference between her prose and poetry , and in the present discussion I do n't care . What is important is that Rich is a poet , a genuine poet , and has been all her life . Whatever the state of the world , she would be writing fine poems . If the actual state of the world has driven her to devote part of her energy to polemic , she remains a poet primarily . And I do not imply by this that the ideology is unimportant to the poetry . On the contrary , the ideology is what has permitted her to combine traditional poetic resources with continual personal experiment , exactly the combination that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book is a sequence of sonnetlike love poems ? no , call them true sonnets . For if they do not conform to the prescribed rules , they certainly come from the same lyrical conception that made the sonnet in the first place , and it is long past time to liberate the old term from its tram . meling codes of technique . Here is one from the sequence : It is an outstanding poem , but typical as well of Rich 's way of writing : the genuinely literate sentences woven into genuinely poetic measures , cadences , and patterns of sound ; the easy , perfectly assimilated classical allusion ; the sense of immediate , unique experience ; the details ? here the female mountain and flower ? turned into generalized insights of humane value . These are the resonances we find in all the poems . A mind is here , a loving mind , ? in and of this world , including all this world 's cultural inheritance , yet still asserting , firmly and calmly , its own independence and newness . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose again : humanism androgyny ... meaning that in the present condition of society the poet finds herself so embattled that she can only fight back with equally militant means ; that is , by adopting an anti-male , frankly sexist posture . She implies that this is the case with all women . But she also implies , I believe , that the hope has not been entirely lost of a time when these old words and the vision embodied in them , the " dream of a common language , " may still come true , at least for significant numbers of people . I can not think of any book more likely to help induce such a change than this one by Adrienne Rich . T HE POETRY OF Donald Hall is native gift , his willingness to again a different case . His excellence is , aside from his risk being merely good ; at least that is one way of putting it . He writes poems that have already been written thousands and thousands of times . Like all risk-takers , he sometimes fails . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is very short , has the distinction of containing the worst poem I have read this year ; I mean " 0 cheese , " which however I read it , grimly , lightheartedly , sardonically , turns out a disaster . Well , so much the better ; at least it is not good . And other poems in his book seem to me both excellent and deeply moving . But how many nostalgic elegies have we read about changing times , loss of values , the ugliness of the present compared with the past ? Thousands , literally . Such poetry is the cornerstone of the temple of goodness ? and of our boredom . Hall dares to write it , to challenge our boredom , and he succeeds , His best poems , which are about the New England countryside , his childhood there , his ancestors , are rather long , making me reluctant to quote snippets , since they can not do justice to his achievement . Nevertheless here are three lines from a poem about sheep : Notice the simplicity , economy , balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archaic ( " delved " ) , the poetic ( " winter grass " ) , and the modernistic literal ( " in nineteen-fifty " ) . Then imagine this spread over four or five pages , gradually and quietly building in intensity . It is a question of really functional line-structure and perfectly controlled diction , shifts of rising and falling accents . It may seem casual , and indeed that is what is intended , but it is as far from the modish flatness of the good poets as bronze is from plastic . Maybe bronzen is the word for Hall 's best work , which has a deep luster and a slowly reverberating tone . Hall lives on the farm in New Hampshire that has been in his family for something like 200 years . No doubt this accounts in part for the authenticity of his poems . The details are known , but to him , not to us . They come to us with perhaps an aura of familiarity , because the convention he has chosen is such a common one , but within the aura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are nostalgic and melancholy from the first line , but that is mood , not motion . We are moved , as the poem progresses , by Hall 's clear , authentic memories in his clear , authentic language . Convention is the starting place , in other words , not the ending , and that makes all the difference . m ABLE policy 's BOOK The Twelve-spoked Wheel Flashing contains much wit , moral concern , close observation , valuable thought and feeling , and it is well-written ; yet it misses excellence , if by only a little . I open to a random page : to sleep .. ? ... and so on and so on . You see ? The substance is there , but the poetry is the same lineless , tuneless , stressless stuff , with the same expectable enjambments , that thousands of others are writing . The common American style , in other words . I can not find Pierce in her book , though I find abundant information about her . Is this what we want , this anonymity ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of collectivism , which can become only more and more collectivized , and that consequently art should speak in a collective voice . Well . this is just what we have . Myself , I rebel . I can not imagine a real art that lacks the presence of an authentic , authorial person , which alone can combine and integrate the other components . The common American style is interesting , but it is not moving , and hence , to my mind at least , it is not real art . There are lines in Adrienne Rich 's book equal to anything Shakespeare ever wrote . This is not an extreme statement , nor is it an aesthetic judgment . At a certain point , works of art transcend aesthetic analysis and become authentic metaphysical objects , like natural things . We do not recognize the authenticity of natural things , a tree or a raccoon , simply because they are there , because they exist ; existence is merely the undifferentiated and seething atomic mass . We recognize them because they are functionally complete . They transcend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including works of art , and it happens more often than one might think . History is almost cluttered with them , though we would be unwilling to sacrifice any . These objects are equivalent . A tree is not " better " than a raccoon . A poem by Shakespeare is not " better " than one by Rich , assuming in each case poems that really are authentic . ( Even Homer nodded . ) Functional completeness , the combining imagination , the presence of original sensibility , and style as the em-BOOKS bodiment of authenticity : these are the ideas to hang onto . I can not see why so many thousands of poets ? and believe me , we have immense numbers at work in this country today ? fail to grasp these ideas . Not all of them are young , but most are . The poets who are working authentically are nearly all older , of Rich 's genera . tion and mine . Moreover , most of them have been teachers at one time or another , and many have made their livings at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not learned what poetry really is or how it comes to be . Maybe in practical classroom terms it is as simple as the relationship between poetry and language : you can not make poetry out of language , but you can make language out of poetry . if the work . shops could once get that proposition straight , instead of backassward as they have it now , a mighty improvement possibly could occur . But the teaching has failed . Where ? Why ? How ? If anyone can tell me , I 'd really like to know .
