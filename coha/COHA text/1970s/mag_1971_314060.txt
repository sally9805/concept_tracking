In this bitter winter of high national unemployment , Seattle has the unhappy distinction of leading Americas major metropolitan centers with a staggering unemployment rate of 10.9%-almost double the national rate of 5.8% . Seattle 's troubles largely have their origin in the troubles of the Boeing Co. , which at its peak employed 1 out of 12 people in the Seattle area . But the effects ripple out to touch nearly everyone , as TIME Correspondent Karsten Prager reports : <P> THE facade is deceptive : busy , brightly decorated city streets , department stores full of holiday shoppers , the freeway humming with traffic . The Seattle SuperSonics are drawing sizable crowds at the Seattle Center Coliseum in the shadow of the Space Needle ; their record is soso , but they are making money and their attendance is fourth in the N.B.A. M*A*S*H. now in its eighth month at the downtown Coliseum Theater , is still pulling them in at $2.50 per seat . All over town , station KIRO-TV 's billboards ask , HAVE YOU HEARD A GOOD ONE LATELY ? - part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inception last May . <P> But good news is the individual incident , not the general reality in Seattle . Under the veneer , it is a troubled , uncertain city , its crisis real . It is a town that has had its downs before , but never quite to this degree : out of an area population estimated at 1,400 , - 000 , more than 71,500 are out of work ; 66,000 are on county welfare rolls ; 72,000 on food stamps . In little more than two years , Boeing employment has plummeted from 101,500 to 46,800 . By the end of 1971 it will probably sink to 32,500 . It could go as low as 25,000 if the U.S. Senate goes through with its threat to cut off funds for Boeing 's SST development program , a project that still employs 4,800 workers . The company has already sold one plant , closed another , auctioned off surplus equipment and furniture , consolidated assembly lines , cut its 747 jumbo-jet production from 7 a month to 5 . The Boeing cuts have given Seattle unemployment a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of whom have never been out of work before , and for whom prospects elsewhere are hardly encouraging . Cal Lowe , 45 , a former flight test engineer , has been luckier than many of his colleagues : from Thanksgiving to Christmas Eve he played Santa Claus at a downtown department store . He and another former engineer were picked out of ten men who applied . Despite the fact that the Seattle Times printed ten times more help-wanted classified than situations-wanted last month , good jobs are hard to come by . Most of the ads offer either overseas work , low-paying jobs or commission deals . <P> Whenever something acceptable opens up . the lines are long : 280 men recently took examinations for 20 police vacancies . Sometimes the Boeing label can actually hinder . " Saying that you 've been in aerospace around here is like having a wart on your nose , " says Lowe . To counter that , some 100 unemployed have come together in a group called Talent Plus Inc. , with the aim of finding new jobs partly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonaerospace background as possible . A few jobs have opened up .
