IT was a dramatic turn in the endless , blood-drenched conflict between Britain and Ireland , Protestant and Catholic . It was also the boldest step of British Prime Minister Edward Heath 's career . In a daring attempt to end the terror in Northern Ireland , he last week imposed direct rule by London on that troubled province . Hoping to break " the vicious circle of violence and yet more violence , " Heath suspended for at least a year the Protestant-dominated government at Stormont , which has ruled Ulster since 1921 . For Catholics , it was the most significant victory yet won for political equality . But in ending home rule , he ran the huge risk of entangling Britain even more deeply in Ulster 's troubles and loosing new legions of communal furies . <P> Heath 's immediate aim was to pacify Ulster 's 500,000 Catholics and thus dry up their support of the outlawed Irish Republican Army . At week 's end , though , the urgent question was whether Heath 's proposals-or any others that would satisfy Ulster 's Catholics - might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Jackboot Unionism . Protesting what they regarded as a sellout , 6,000 Protestant shipyard workers walked off their jobs and marched on Belfast 's city hall , carrying Union Jacks and the red cross flag of Ulster . William Craig , the right-wing former Home Minister who heads the militant Ulster Vanguard , warned that " Ulster is closer to civil war today than it was yesterday . " He called for a massive , two-day strike this week by Protestant workers who man Ulster 's public services , and vowed that the shutdown would be only the beginning . " We have the power to make government in this country impossible , " he declared . <P> Moderate Catholic leaders , although fearful of the Protestant reaction , voiced a predominant mood of relief that they were no longer governed by the Protestant Unionist Party at the Parliament in Stormont . " Catholics have lost the feel of jackboot Unionism , " exulted Gerry Fitt , leader of the Social and Democratic Labor Party . If that mood continued and if the Protestants could be restrained , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of luck , might win his gamble . <P> Clearly some dramatic stroke had been needed to halt the campaign of I.R.A . bombings , which reached a bloody climax in Belfast last week . There , pedestrians crowding a busy shopping street sought refuge in a narrow thoroughfare after police received a series of telephoned warnings that a bomb was due to go off in a nearby street . Suddenly 100 Ibs. of gelignite exploded-not where it had been said to be , but in a car parked amid the fleeing shoppers . In the heaviest daylight toll to date , six were killed and 146 injured . Two days later , another bomb exploded , near the Great Victoria Street Railway Station , wrecking passenger cars , shattering every window in one entire side of the nearby Europa hotel , Belfast 's newest , and injuring 70.
