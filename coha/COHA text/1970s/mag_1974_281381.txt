When I was the head of our party and government , we decreased the size of our army both in the Soviet Union and in the fraternal Warsaw Pact countries . Some people who read my memoirs may misinterpret that policy and say it was wrong for us to cut back our troop levels . I think the majority of those who might take this " view can be found among the military . However , I 'm convinced we were right to do what we did . I 'm still in favor of removing Soviet troops from other countries , and would fight for implementing that policy if I could . But how can anyone fight for the reduction of armed forces when a certain orator * is preaching quite the opposite ? How can anyone propagate the doctrine I 've been advocating if the troops under the command of this orator are stationed on the territory of other countries ? We ca n't make propaganda for peaceful coexistence and noninterference and then turn around and put our troops in other countries . Under such circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishes nothing and earns the confidence of no one . <P> We must press for arms control . In my day we were able to persuade the imperial ! sts that it was in their interests , as well as in ours , to limit the arms race . During my political career we reached a partial agreement on nuclear testing . We agreed to ban tests in three spheres : the air , the land , and under water . The treaty was signed in Moscow on August 5 , 1963 . It was a good beginning , but the United States refused to include underground tests in the ban . <P> While it might still be true that the United States has quantitative advantage over us-and that NATO has a quantitative advantage over the Warsaw Pact - in terms of total accumulated means of destruction , we no longer lag behind to any significant degree . In my last years as head of the government , our military theoreticians calculated that we had the nuclear capacity to blast our enemies into dust . We stockpiled enough weapons to destroy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our potential enemies in Europe . <P> Therefore , I think there is no longer any reason for us to resist the idea of international control . If I had any influence on the policy of the Soviet Union , I would urge that we sign a mutual agreement providing for on-site inspection in designated parts of the country around our western frontiers . <P> Sticking to the matter of our relations with the West , I 'd also favor on-site inspection at all military bases , especially airfields . It 's essential that airfields be open to inspection , so that neither side could concentrate troop transports for a sneak attack . We 're afraid of a surprise attack by our enemies just as much as they 're afraid of such an attack by us . We need a system of inspection as much as they do . <P> In short , I would like to see us sign a mutual treaty of nonaggression and inspection . I emphasize " mutual . " The treaty would have to be genuinely reciprocal ; neither side should try to deceive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
