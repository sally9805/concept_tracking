THE VICAR OF CHRIST by Walter F. Murphy Macmillan ; 632 pages ; $12.95 <P> The proposition is preposterous . Once again the Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church gather to elect a successor to the late Pope , killed in a plane crash . The conclave is deadlocked . An Italian prelate offers a radical proposal : elect a monk . Said monk is not your average Trappist . He is a former U.S. Marine colonel who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for leading his troops out of a deathtrap during the Korean War ; a Pulitzer prizewinner for the book he wrote about the experience ; a former presidential emissary to the Vatican ; and , until his retirement to the monastery , Chief Justice of the United States . Why not Pope ? <P> One of the classic tests of a writer is his ability to persuade an audience to suspend disbelief . Walter F. Murphy persuades . In his hands , the audacious thesis of this massive , complex first novel becomes fascinatingly logical and intellectually gripping . No better fiction on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Princeton law professor , is a compulsive storyteller , and in The Vicar of Christ he tells three tales that could have made books in themselves . Part 1 , reliving Declan Walsh 's military adventures in Korea through the ripely phrased recollections of a Marine master gunnery sergeant , is a crisp , realistic novella . Part 2 , narrated in the fastidious accents of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court , makes the arcane milieu of the Nine Old Men for once intelligible . Part 3 is the center of the novel . Its narrator , Ugo Cardinal Galeotti , is an urbane Vatican veteran who enjoys fine wine and good company . He possesses a thoughtful spiritual vision as well , and it is through his eyes that the reader is led along on Declan Walsh 's odyssey of the soul as Pope Francesco I. <P> Francesco is dogged by a destiny that oscillates between a quest for sanctity and demonstrations of hubris . He is crowned with the triple tiara that Popes John Paul I and John Paul II rejected , to let men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spain murder priests under the approving eyes of Cabinet ministers , Francesco revives medieval precedent and threatens to place the entire country under interdict unless the culprits are punished . When a cabal of Cardinals plots to depose him , he dispatches them into exile with all the brutal efficiency of a Nixonian Saturday Night Massacre . " Declan , Declan , " warns a purged friend on another occasion , " because you love no one , you think you love God . " <P> Despite his autocratic methods , the Pope remains a theological liberal , a doubting Declan carrying the keys of the Kingdom . Sensitive to the anguish of Catholic couples , he adroitly bypasses the birth control ban of Pope Paul VI 's Humanae vitae . He sets afoot a plan to bring divorced and remarried Catholics back to the sacraments from which they are barred . He admits that " every intelligent human has some doubts about an afterlife .
