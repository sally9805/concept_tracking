To the Editor : At the NATO Washington meeting , British Prime Minister Callaghan made the sensible comment on Soviet and Cuban activity in Africa that it was important to analyze the situation and not rush into action . The Horn of Africa is cited as a Soviet-Cuban triumph . Yet the Soviets suffered a severe setback there when they were evicted by Somalia . In aiding Ethiopia in the war with Somalia , the Soviets found themselves in a position not unknown to American policymakers : arms supplier to both sides . It is not clear how the Soviets and Cubans , while supporting the winning side , will benefit tangibly from their involvement . The political situation in Ethiopia continues to be unstable , to say the least . If the Soviets and Cubans become involved in Eritrea , they enter a quagmire , fighting an indigenous people ? not invaders , as with Somalia ? in a mountainous terrain . ( This should give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pause . ) Although they backed the winning side in Angola , again it is not clear how the Soviets and Cubans have benefit NIculaeAsclu Of Postage Past To the Editor : This morning I picked up from a Brooklyn sidewalk three beautiful , big , strong rubber bands such as the mail carriers throw away after taking them off the packages of envelopes they are about to deliver . At 75 , I 'm happy to stoop down and get these ? the only concrete dividends I receive from Uncle Sam . Now that postage on first-class letters has gone up another two cents ? or , on my slide rule , 15.4 percent ? I am reminded of the running battle my mother had with the post office back in the second decade of this century . And she was not alone . She had a sharp . tongue and a sharp pen . When she could reach the local postmaster , she lashed at him for the failures of the ? local service . When she could n't reach ' him on the phone , she slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do believe that in those days first-class letters went for two cents locally , three cents outside Madison ( Wisc. ) and postal cards for one cent . ? The more costs go up , the less service improves . In my company we now send by private carrier much that formerly we sent by Postal Service . The postal price changes will encourage private enterprisers , and another law will be in jeopardy . Ben must be whirling in his crave . ELIOT H. SHARP Brooklyn , May 27 , 1978 ed , or how the vital interests of the United States are adversely affected . The most authoritative thing that can be said of the fighting in Shaba Province is that no one really knows what happened . Myths were created to justify United States intervention in Vietnam . ( One myth being that a Communist victory would bring Vietnam under Chinese domination . ) Today we are in danger of creating a new set of myths about Africa . The Soviets and Cubans have had limited success in Africa , for which they are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they are not going to take over the place . Troublemakers they are and will continue to be , but we should not forget that the Soviets have already compiled an unenviable record of being expelled from three countries on the African continent : Egypt , Sudan and Somalia . Given Soviet clumsiness and insensitivity , the list is certain to lengthen . To think that African countries , having sought independence for so long , intend now to become puppets of the Soviet Union or Cuba flies in the face of the continent 's history . To the Editor : Your recent editorial " How to Unsoak the Rich " coincides with a news item in your financial section on Congressional nervousness about the Internal Revenue Service 's desire to tax fringe benefits as income . Is it possible these questions are related and that you are being superficial in your treatment of these complex matters ? The voters may be doing their arithmetic and concluding that in states like New York , working men , labor union members , will soon be paying a 60 percent incremental tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high inflation and constant tax brackets . The coal strike , as you perceptively pointed out , was to a large extent about fringe benefits . Right now , most of the pain created by the taxation of capital gains ( the interaction of the 50 percent limitation on taxes on earned income with other provisions of the tax code ) is felt by persons who have high earned income , but this pain will soon be shared by millions of workers who are steadily rising through inflation into higher tax brackets . Sacramento Fault To the Editor : June 6 will go down in history as the day of California 's Tax Quake.The passage of Proposition 3 will have an effect that wo n't be felt at once , since the state boasts a surplus that will help the first year , if properly distributed . How to distribute fairly is also more easily said than done , but that 's the minor problem . The major problem will come the following year when the the surplus is gone . Of course the state will still be there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It wo n't be as though the San Andreas fault had let go and dropped large parts of California into the Pacific . Thank God ! But Proposition 13 , if not a geologic fault , is still a time bomb of sorts . The Sacramento fault ! The rest of us may have reason to be grateful to the State of California . We may learn how to keep the baby , while disposing of the bathwater . ARTHUR J. MORGAN New York , June 6 , 1978 1110 ** 011:11CJ ** UC aevere in its denunciations of Soviet and ' Cuban military activity in Africa . ( The Soviets never hesitated to &-; flounce our role in . Vietnam . ) We should reject out-of-hand suggestions for U.S.-supported covert activity in Angola or anywhere else , which world undermine the moral force of our opposition to outside military interference in African affairs and make a mockery of our legitimate criticism of Soviet and Cuban activity . We should encourage African solutions to African problems . And we should not permit Soviet activity in Africa , which over the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us from completing a SALT agreement or any other agreement which serves our national interests . This is a point the Soviets understand well . It will be recalled that in 1972 the Soviet Union received President Nixon even though he had just ordered the mining of North Vietnamese ports , and the two sides signed the first strategic arms treaty . WILLIAM J. DEAN New York , June 3 , 1978 Ironically , successful high-income earners who work for a living are treated worse by the current tax rules than those who inherited fortunes and live on interest or dividends . It isn't. the rich who are being soaked but the competent and industrious . Your newspaper is too sophisticated and influential to skate over this difficult matter without consideration of indexation . A tax on capital gains resulting purely from inflation is a form of confiscation , less onerous at 25 percent than at 49 but confiscation all the same . Faced with confiscation , those who hold capital will do everything they can to delay it , thus making our capital markets increasingly illiquid on all levels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of living in order to determine true increase in value . Indexation is now used in labor settlements and is increasingly common in the naturalresource industries ( e.g. royalties ) . The real problem is still inflation , but this would at least be one way to make the tax system fairer . HENRY R. BRECK New York , June 5 , 1978 A Cyprus Solution To the Editor : The Cyprus problem would cease to be intractable if the United States would offer to resume armament shipments to Turkey , on the scale previously envisaged but upon the withdrawal of Turkish forces from the island . Pending such withdrawal , we should position a token force of American troops on the Greek side of the demarcation line to discourage possible further Turkish incursions into the present Greek zone . After Turkish troops have left the island , the interests of both the Greek and the Turkish population should be safeguarded under the aegis of an international commission representing the NATO membership . It is fully tenable that NATO be entitled to protect the alliance 's interests by assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mutually administered trust territory . PAULA . CHADWELL Washington , May 31 , 1978 It Is n't the Rich Who Are Being Soaked ' F-15 's for Saudi Arabia : The ' Uneasy Anticipation ' To the Editor : With several squadrons of F-15 's now destined for Saudi Arabia , I offer the following five points in the spirit , not of partisanship , but of uneasy anticipation . ( 1 ) Despite the oft-repeated dissemblance that the Saudis need advanced aircraft to protect themselves against Iraq , Southern Yemen , Ethiopia , the Soviet Union and Iran , their acquisition of 60 ** is intended to improve their capabilities vis-a-vis Israel . As unlikely as Soviet intervention in Saudi Arabia is , the ** will not deter and could not defeat it . Nor will they have kit ) great an effect in deterring an Iranian invasion , yet another unlikely . As for Iraq , Southern Yemen , Ethiopia , potential insurgencies , etc. , F-5 's ( with perhaps a few ** for the benefit of the Iraqis ) would do quite nicely . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , less advanced military powers , they would acquire a more stable and utilitarian mix of fighter aircraft . Instead , they are loading up with silver bullets . Imagination of the ? purpose for which these are intended does not take a Dante or a Brueghel. ( 2 ) If the U.S. genuinely wanted to offset the advantage that the F-15 's will lend to the Arab coalition ( despite White House statements to the contrary , the historical record still shows Saudi military participation in the 1948 , 1967 and 1973 wars against Israel ) , it would require the Saudis to base the ** at . Tabuq , and thus make them easier for Israel to monitor and , if necessary , destroy . Rearward basing is In fact the only real Saudi option in using the ** against Israel . ( 3 ) The controversy about bomb racks is sublime irrelevance . The F15 's Phoenix missile system , EW suite , and onboard computers allow it to attack six aerial targets simultaneously , at ranges up to 100 miles . It is the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like using a Ferrari to deliver coal . Besides , anyone can make a bomb rack . We used to construct them on my kibbutz , in the tractor garage . ( 4 ) The tactical use to which the F15 's would best be put is neither to carry 2,000-pound bombs nor to fly cover for Arab attack aircraft ( as The Times has recently suggested ) , but , in a major war , to divert and damage a sizable portion of the Israeli Air Force , thus enhancing chances for success of the main Arab air activity . A base in Saudi Arabia 's north would serve to refuel the 60 aircraft configured as interceptors . This flight of ** with 360 potential.kills before reload , would he the best possible contribution to a greater , more conventional , more massive air attack from Egypt and Syria , as Israel would be forced to meet it in kind , siphoning from the main battle its most advanced aircraft . The argument that the Saudis would always eschew this tactic for fear of leaving their oil fields vulnerable is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves among them ) the Saudis might be willing to accept such a risk in exchange for a final , decisive blow against Israel . And dispatching planes to war against oil fields would further denude an already denuded Israeli defence , thus reinforcing the original plan of diversion . ( 5 ) Though the ** will not tip the Middle East military balance decisively , they are a serious threat to Israel nonetheless in a tactical sense , in a political sense ( raising once again Arab confidence in the war option ) and in the sense that they are a foot , or rather 60 feet , in the door to the American arsenal .
