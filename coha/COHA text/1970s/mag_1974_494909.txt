DECEMBER 21 , 1974 called out " Hi , Al . " Barkan turned to him , his mouth opened , nothing came out , and he turned to check out . There is some evidence that Jackson has lost ground , particularly across the South and Southwest . Many delegates with oil incomes or constituencies shook their heads firmly when Jackson was mentioned and put themselves on the side of Texas ' Lloyd Bentsen . In these areas Jackson and Bentsen are fighting for the same constituency and Bentsen is chipping away . Jackson still does command strong support . He was well received at the Illinois caucus , where Mayor Richard Daley called him " an outstanding American " and Jackson reminded Daley 's cheering charges that his state of Washington voted unanimously to seat the Daley delegation at Miami Beach . " I think we were the only ones who did , " Jackson said . Jackson did n't put on a mob scene at the bar as Bentsen did with his reception for 5000 , said to cost $20,000 . But a steady stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their way through Jackson 's trailer in the exhibit area ( where Udall also - had a booth ) , picked up a drink or two and had snatches of conversation with the candidate . For charm , no one matched Georgia 's Gov . Jimmy Carter and his sons . The party 's happy warrior , Hubert 13 Humphrey , was everywhere and always available for long interviews with the press , but he was n't talking like a candidate . Since most Minnesotans have come to believe there 's a constitutional requirement that their state have a candidate , and with Mondale out of it , Humphrey was pushing Gov . Wendell Anderson . Terry Sanford waited until Sunday afternoon to call delegates from the floor to ask them to head up his campaign . Sanford has a critical problem , however . If he ca n't whip Wallace in North Carolina , he ca n't be taken seriously . Yet his state 's primary comes too late , in the spring to use it as a launching pad for a national effort , so Sanford must decide whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state defeat by Wallace . He is said to be inclined to wade right into the New Hampshire primary . Wallace had little impact here . His forces were able to elect only a handful of delegates . He had little power on the floor . He flew in early , greeted delegates and met the press in his suite on Friday , and then left before the convention was gaveled into session Satur ? day morning . But since he 'll be able to garner a lot more delegates from primaries in 1976 than he could in 1972 , the brevity of his appearance should give no comfort to his adversaries . Writing about " Money and Politics , " this journal 's editors said recently that the American political game is not " fixed " by corporate special interest , that there are " strong countervailing pressures in the political money market . " True as far as it goes ; these days , the government owns the railroads instead of the other way around . Nevertheless money still talks big and often irresponsibly . Not all special interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence . They get their money in small , voluntary donations from carpenters , machinists , doc ? tors , dairy farmers , bank executives , teachers , who are thus drawn into politics . There are literally hundreds BRooics JACKSON is a Washington newspaperman who has written extensively on the milk fund scandal . of such political action committees registered at the national level-572 at last count . Most are small In a given election year only a handful ever raise as much as $100,000 . Even some of the big ones act in a pretty responsible manner . The life insurance lobby , for ex ? ample , has spent $232,841 this year on politics , but its most recent contributions included none higher than $500 to any single candidate . It is hard to imagine buy ? ing a congressman for that , inflation being what it is . The trouble begins when a special interest group has huge assets and a pointed interest in a particular piece of legislation . The American Medical Association , for example , wants badly to influence the shape of na ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Washington Post , the AMA 's state and federal arms have distributed $1.5 million to 300 con gressional candidates since the 1972 election . AMA money frequently is given in chunks of $5000 or so . Lately it is going to sponsors of the AMA 's medicredit bill at twice the rate that it is going to nonsponsors . One must at least infer that the AMA is influencing these legislators , or rewarding them . There is no " strong countervailing pressure " from sick people . Granted , there is money on the other side . The United Auto Workers favor more liberal health care legislation than does the AMA , and the union has spent $862,000 on politics this year . But the auto work ? ers have a range of interests and are n't likely to abandon an otherwise acceptable congressman just because he votes " wrong " on health insurance . Judg ? ing from the 1974 AMA spending reports , a congress ? man risks losing AMA support if he fails to sponsor their legislation . he use of special-interest money sometimes gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? cutions in the case of dairy trusts . In that case , it will be recalled , Harold Nelson and David Parr of Associ ? ated Milk Producers , Inc. promised the Nixon White House they would funnel two million dollars into the President 's reelection campaign . ( No countervailing pressure from milk drinkers here . ) Nixon raised milk prices ? apparently to beat Congress to the punch ? and there is evidence that the White House then squeezed a reaffirmation of the two million dollar promise out of Nelson just before the price hike was announced publicly . The dairymen then delivered several hundred thousand dollars to Nixon and might have given even more if his fund-raisers had n't been so slow in providing the secret conduits . Is that bribery ? The House Judiciary Committee did n't think so , but 16 of its members got donations from the same dairy groups , so they were n't exactly disinterested . Before Nixon was pardoned , the Water ? gate special prosecution force said in court that a pos ? sible bribery and conspiracy case might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties for two different kinds of bribery . First there 's the outright purchase of government favors . The law provides up to five years in jail and a $20,000 fine for an official found guilty of taking anything valuable " in return for . . . being in ? fluenced in his performance of any official act . " The second prohibits an official from taking anything of value " for or because of any official act , even if he would have performed the act anyway in the normal course of his duties . This goes by the legal name of an " illegal gratuity , " although it falls under the same gen ? eral heading of bribery . In one case that went to the Supreme Court , a tax accountant was convicted of illegal gratuities because he gave " Christmas gifts " of $25 and $50 to Internal Revenue agents who went easy in auditing his clients . The intent of the illegal gratuitylaw is to prohibit a more subtle form of corruption than the outright purchase of government favors . As it is written , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabinet members , members of Congress and Presidents . John Connally was charged under the illegal gratuity section on grounds that he received two $5000 gifts from milk producers as a re ? ward for his help in getting Nixon to raise price sup ? ports . It seems likely that Connally would have supported the dairymen 's case with or without a gift , so no bribery case could be made out . But if he took the money , which he swears he did not , then he could be found guilty of taking a gratuity . The same princi ? ple applies to Connally as to the wayward tax agent . There is no conclusive ruling yet on whether an elected official can be prosecuted under the gratuity section for taking a campaign contribution " for or be ? cause of " an official act . The Supreme Court seemed to open the way for such prosecutions in 1972 when it ruled that the Constitution 's speech or debate clause was no protection from prosecution for former Mary ? land Sen. Daniel B. Brewster , who was accused- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in return for sponsoring legislation opposed to an increase in postal rates . Brewster was tried for bribery but con ? victed of the lesser charge of taking gratuities . The US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned that conviction last August on grounds that the trial judge had confused the jury with his explana ? tion of the differences between bribes , gratuities and legal campaign donations . The appeals court then gave its own ruminations on the subject , volunteering the opinion that campaign donations probably ca n't be construed as gratuities because of two words in the law . The gratuity section , unlike the bribery section , forbids an official to take anything valuable " for him ? self . " The bribery section forbids him to take such gifts " for himself or for any other person or entity . " The appeals court said that any donations given to a legally constituted campaign committee ca n't be gra ? tuities unless the prosecutor can prove the committee was an " alter ego " for the congressman , or was used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of pass ? ing some of the money through a committee account and into his personal account . ) The maritime labor unions present another , more recent example of quasi-bribery by a well funded lobby . These unions held combined political assets well in excess of one million dollars and used them in an unusually ruthless manner on behalf of a bill that would mean thousands of jobs for union seamen . Passed by both houses , it would require eventually that 30 percent of the nation 's oil imports travel in American flagships , manned of course by union crews . The bill was opposed editorially by newspapers of such diverse viewpoints as The Wall Street Journal , New York Daily News and The Washington Post . So far this year , the unions have contributed more UECEMBER 21,1974 ' - than $500,000 to 170 members of the Senate and House who supported the bill and only $28,400 to 22 who voted against it . The largest donation , $22,000 , went to Sen. Russell B. Long ( D , La. ) who guided the bill to passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others given " for or because of " their support for the - bill ? If it is bad public policy to allow an IRS agent to take a $25 gift for a soft tax audit , is it not as bad to let a senator take $20,000 while helping to get more govern , ment subsidies for a maritime union that gave the money ? It is probably worse , because the public treas ? ury loses hundreds of millions of dollars in maritime subsidies but only a relative handful of dollars through - the chiseling of a single IRS agent . Except in the most flagrant cases , the way to prevent - this sort of influence is not through bribery prosecu ? tions . The cure is either to limit the size of special-interest donations or to eliminate them entirely . As a practical matter the new campaign law does - neither , and will make matters worse than they are . It will limit donations by individuals to $1000 per elec ? tion , but will permit " political committees " to give $5000 per election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate ? $5000 in the primary and $5000 in the general . In the case of the dairy trusts , since there are three of them and they often act in con ? cert , the practical limit would be $30,000 per candidate , which is a lot of money . In actual practice there may turn out to be no limits whatsoever on the amount of money a single interest group can give ; the definition of " political committee " is so sloppy that any one group could multiply itself , amoeba fashion , setting up many committees . The new federal elections corn , mission might forestall this with a few strict rulings. * But it might not . he situation is likely to degenerate further if new interests begin to follow the lead of the dairy and mari ? time trusts . Did Pan American fail to get a subsidy ? Perhaps it should set up a political fund and raise one million dollars or so from its employees . That would help put it on an equal footing with the subsidized merchant marine . Already dentists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ex ? ample by setting up their own funds . New committees register every week . Common Cause wants public financing of congres ? sional races as well as presidential elections . This would solve the problem of quasi-bribery by a few ir ? responsible lobbies , but it would also have some bad side effects . It would wipe out the hundreds of political ? cal institutions that now bring small donors into the * democratic process . It would force some money under ? ground , although there is almost certainly a lot of it there already . And it would lead to an ugly public reac ? tion against the inevitable new kind of campaign abuse it would breed : the fraudulent candidacy . Inevi ? tably some of the thousand or so subsidized candida 15 cies would be exposed as mere schemes to tap the treasury through nepotism , phony vouchers , padded payrolls and kickbacks . The alternative is to try putting strict , enforceable limits on spending by interest groups . The first step would be to limit each such group to a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits each candidate to one major campaign committee . Interest groups might also be permitted to have state-level committees if their money is raised , controlled and spent on the state level , and they are not used as de ? vices for avoiding spending limits . Transfers of money between state and national committees should be pro ? hibited as a safeguard against cheating . The second step would be to put a more stringent limit on the amount any interest group committee may give a congressional candidate . The new limit of $5000 per election is too high for a House race , where a candidate will be prohibited from spending any more than $70,000 per election . Even if a candidate spent the limit , he could get it all from as few as 14 lobbyists , or seven if each of them controlled both a state and a na ? tional committee . That puts too much power in the lobbyists ' checkbooks . The $5000 limit is probably reasonable for a Senate race in a big state , where legal limits will run up to $1.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts to one percent of the candidate 's legal spending limit , with an absolute ceiling of $5000 . This would work out to $700 per election for a House candidate , $1000 for a Senate candidate in a small-state primary , $2548 for a Senate candidate in the Connecticut general election , and $5000 for a Sen ? ate candidate in New York and California . Basically , no group should be allowed to give a congressman a sum so large he would fear losing it . Strictly enforced , such a scheme would encourage formation of state-level committees , making it a little harder for journalists to keep track of the money but also broadening the base of political financing . Another effect would be to encourage more candidates to stir themselves to raise their own small donations instead of letting the unions , the dairy co-ops or the AMA do it for them . A lot of candidates this year operated under self-imposed limits on the size of do ? nations . Ramsey Clark in New York took no more than $100 , Ed Edmondson in Oklahoma no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financed their campaigns . Pete du Pont in Delaware raised more than $100,000 in small donations . The electoral process need not depend on COPE or AMPI for its solvency . Lobbyists look for loopholes with about the same fervor that lifers plot jailbreaks , so enforcement of strict limits on special interest contributions may eventually prove unworkable . If that happens , public financing would be worth a try . In any case some fur ? ther refinements of our mixed system should be con ? sidered before the 1976 congressional campaigns .
