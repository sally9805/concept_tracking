txt The South Vietnamese National Assembly 's passage of a controversial election provipori will make it extremely difficult for Vice-President Nguyen Cao Ky to qualify as a presidential candidate , say political observers in Saigon . This seems to be the most important conclusion to emerge so far from the Assembly 's vote . - - the The lower house of , the Assembly has just passed the election provision by a vote of 101 deputies out of 122 present . The provision requires that a candidate for the presidency be nominated by 40 national assemblymen or by 100 provincial and city councillors . The final vote came after two days of heated debate which reached a climax when one deputy , a Ky supporter , brandished a hand grenade to protest the proposed election provision . The deputy , Nguyen Dac Dan , a mustachioed former Army captain who looks like Vice-President Ky , dominated the proceedings for a while , and the Speaker of the Assembly quit the rostrum and went into hiding . In the end , Mr. Dan yielded the grenade to house officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election was thought to be one of the motives of President Nguyen Van Thieu in pushing for passage of the election provision . He also sought to limit the field of candidates in the forthcoming election in order to prevent a recurrence of the 1967 situation in which there were 11 candidates In that election , Mr. Thieu won with only , , - 35 percent of the votes . Mr. Thieu clearly intends to run again in the election scheduled for October . But this time he wants to win with a clear-cut ma jority . Mr. Thieu has not enjoyed being called a " minority president . " The overwhelming vote in favor of the election-law amendment did little to enhance the prestige of Mr. Thieu or that of the National Assembly . Local newsmen and some of the deputies themselves openly attributed the heavy pro-Thieu vote to vote buying . And one opposition newspaper even quoted what it said was the price the government was paying for a vote in favor of the election clause . The paper , Tin Sang ( Morning News ) , said the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 000 piasters ( $2,544 ) . Mr. Thieu 's chief potential rival at the moment is Duong Van Minh , the retired general and former chief of state popularly known as " Big Minh . " General Minh spoke out against the new election provision prior to its passage . He said it would be " unconstitutional , " although the Constitution does not rule against such a provision . But political analysts feel General Minh will be able to get the necessary backing required by the new election provision if he decides to run . // *Ky loses a round in South Viet vote // If Mr. Ky were ' eligible to run  --  and he now says he definitely would like to run  --  his appeal could be expected to cut into votes that would otherwise go to Mr. Thieu . Thus Mr. Ky 's elimination from the race would benefit Mr. Thieu more than Mr. Minh . Position shifted But despite the doubts of analysts here that Mr. Ky could meet the requirements of the new election-law amendment , the Vice-President 's aides are bravely in sisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to get the necessary support . Once noted as one of South Vietnam 's leading " hawks , " Mr. Ky has in recent weeks been attempting to stake out a position clearly to the left of Mr. Thieu . He has renounced the possibility of a military victory and called for a political settlement of the war . He has also established a tactical alliance with General Minh , whom he had bitterly denounced a few years ago . The Air Vice-Marshal and General Minh can occasionally be seen playing tennis together . What seems to bring them together is a common interest in undermining Mr. Thieu . But at this point , most observers do not expect their alliance to go much furthel than that .
