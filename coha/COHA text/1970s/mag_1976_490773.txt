THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ON the morning of January 9th , the day after the death of Premier Chou En-hi , the texts of two poems written by Mao Tse-tung in 1965 and released by the Chinese press this New Year 's Day reached the newsstand of Chinese Native Products , Ltd. , on Catherine Street . We went to pick up some copies at the store , which carries an assortment of goods from the People 's Republic , and found a few random shoppers , with stolid faces that showed no particular reaction to the news . We helped ourself to papers in English and Chinese , paid , and left . Outside , the streets displayed that special mixture of grim cityscape and gaudy chinoiserie which distinguishes an American Chinatown , and the thought came of how so many Chinese emigrants have been scattered over the world  --  in each city forming their own neighborhood and opening their own shops , and now , perhaps , all reading the same news of their homeland . In their dispersion , the Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reluctant as some Jews to give up their quarters , their fonds , and their respect for the written word ft is in the Book of Deuteronomy that Moses  --  having prophesied the Diaspora , the scattering of the race " among all people , from one end of the earth even unto the other " ? prepares for his death by leaving his people a song . The analogy with Mao , whose New Year poems are set to music , and whose own approaching end seems doubly foretold by his associate 's passing , is perhaps not too farfetched . He and Chou transformed China , rallied their people to a renewal of the land as radical as the Israelites ' journey out of the wilderness toward a place of abundance . Where once were famine , filth , and corruption , travellers now report health , cleanliness , and order . As the price of this transformation , the Chinese people have suffered the almost gangsterish violence sumtned up in Mao 's " Sayings , " but they may he compensated , we can hope , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in much the way the Mosaic tradition developed , through the contributions of who knows how many successors , from a mere Ten Commandments into the rich narrative of the Pentateuch , the New Year 's publication of these two poems presages in China some wider-spread exercise of free thought and free speech and free writing . As Americans know , a civil war of the sort that produced modern China is the most terrible of conflicts . A friend of ours was a schoolboy under the old Nationalist regime . He remembers one night when rival armies fought a pitched battle outside his boarding school . The children were gathered in one room at the center of the compound , where they heard shooting through most of the night . In the morning , the fields outside revealed tableaux of horror which haunt him still . Our friend belonged to a typical landholding family , which is to say that it owned around five acres . His home was in the province of Kiang-. si , famous now as the site of the first Chinese soviet and as the starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , it did not require great wealth to make one an object of resentment , and the time came when he and his father thought it would be prudent to spend the night with relatives . When he returned in the morning to change his shirt , his mother told him to flee at once , and he did  --  luckily , for the house was soon surrounded by thugs . He does not know how many men were abducted and killed by such ready recruits to the Communist cause , or how many victims were similarly claimed in the terrors of Chiang Kai-shek . Encirclement and escape : the pattern recalls the Chinese game of v. ) ei -- clei ( known here by its Japanese name , go ) , in which a player captures his opponent 's counters by surrounding them with his own . The resemblances between wei-elei and guerrilla warfare have long been remarked by scholars and military thinkers , and in reading Chou 's obituaries we were struck anew by the repetitions of this pattern in the Chinese civil war .

Defending all approaches to their camp except one , at fluangy-angchieh , they invited an attack along that route , and ambushed Chiang 's forces when they came . Later , the Communists ' domain spread through Kiangsi , where Chou joined them in 1931 , and where they were again encircled , and tightly blockaded . In 1934 , they fought their way out of the siege  --  losing a major portion of their forces  --  and began the Long March . Crossing desert and steppe , mountain and marsh , they wandered through much of western China , until , reduced in numbers to a tenth of their original strength , they reached safety in the hills around Yenan . Along the way , they had preached the Communist faith , already beginning that ultimate encirclement achievable in guerrilla warfare : the enlisting of such general sympathy as to enable a revolutionary army , in Mao 's most famous metaphor , to move among the people like fish in the sea . Given the stagnation and immobility of Chiang 's regime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands recognized ) inevitable . The story of the Long March is one of great derring-do . To us , in our less realistic moments , it seems much more interesting than the industrious , dutiful story that Chou lived out during the twenty-seven years of his premiership . This later Chou , for all his flashes of debonair charm , reminded us of nothing so much as a successful executive , and we have no doubt that in another incarnation he would have done marvellously running A.T . &; T. or Con Ed . We hope it is n't untrue to his rec- ord to imagine that , late some night while he was slaving over his papers , he thought nostalgically of the trek to Yenan . Certainly one of Mao 's Ncw Year poems , " Chingkang Mountains Revisited , " shows the persistence of memory : I have long aspired to reach for the clouds . Again I come from afar To climb Chingkangshan , our old haunt .

THE , death of Dame Agatha Christie , whose mystery novels were best-sellers for over five decades and , in tato , sold over four hundred million copies  --  very likely more than the output of any other twentieth-century writer  --  put us in mind of many things . One was the pleasant obbligato that the reading of a Christie novel often provided when we embarked on a trip of any length . Another was a specific insight we once gained into the character of this unusual woman , who in her eighty-five years produced sixty-odd mystery novels , nineteen collections of short stories , eighteen plays , six highly romantic novels ( written under a pseudonym ) , two books of nonfiction , and two volumes of verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place in 1971 , when a young writer of our acquaintance , planning to spend several months in England , wrote to Dame Agatha 's publisher requesting an interview with her , and also wrote directly to Dame Agatha , enclosing a letter of introduction from a colleague of hers she had long admired . The publisher 's reply was a routine turndown . Dame Agatha 's was n't . The letter of introduction , plus , possibly , the young writer 's obvious devotion to her work ( he had read over forty of her novels ) , may have influenced the exceptional detail and generosity of spirit which marked her . ex-pia nation of why she could not accede to his request for an interview .

Crossing SERGEANT WALTER ROBINSON , a black , thirty-year-old carpenter in the United States Army who is stationed at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , walked across the Hudson River last Tuesday morning from Guttenberg , New Jersey , to Manhattan , on amazing special shoes of his own devising . He was aiming for the Seventy-ninth Street Boat Basin , but the tide and the current carried him about half a mile JANUARY 2 ( 2 , I 9 7 downstream . The special shoes , which cost him twenty-five dollars to assemble , are olive-drab air mattresses , each about six feet by two and a quarter , stiffened with aluminum poles , which are surmounted by plywood boards in the middle for the fret .

He stands straight and tall , relaxed , balanced , and mobile . The shoes themselves are almost invisible , being the same shade as river water , and when the Sergeant slides toward you , it is an arresting sight . The Sergeant has already walked the entire fifty-one-mile length of the Panama Canal , and he plans to walk across the English Channel some twenty-two miles by his chosen route  --  later this year . We first saw the Sergeant from a dock at die boat basin .

We were standing with Roger Field , from NBC radio ; Joseph Erdelyi , Jr. , an American-flag peddler who 's a member of the American Party ; and a river man from the Ohio who lives in his boat at the basin .

He was running a vacuum cleaner , and everyone was asking him dead-serious questions like ' Is this the answer to the energy problem ?

Boswell says this supports a theory he developed in three years of guiding tourists around U.K. high spots  --  he also put in five years at a number of English ad agencies  --  that Americans would like to own any artifacts that can be associated with historical figures .

" At least , there was a guy named Arthur and he was married to a chick named Guinevere , and he was almost certainly the king of at least the area around Glastonbury in pre-Norman days . There 's not a lot available from back then , so I may go first to Sherwood Forest and chop down a tree that Robin Hood might have cut his arrows from . " The Smew I AST year around this time , a Ross 's gull  --  the only species of gull with a conspicuously pink breast  --  caused a considerable stir when it ariived at Salisbury , Massachusetts , thousands of miles from its normal home , in Siberia . This year , we have the equally stirring arrival of another exotic bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are waterfowl that nest in northern Europe and Asia from Sweden to Siberia . Never before in recorded history has a sinew visited our East Coast under its own steam . in fact , the only sightings in the United States have been in Alaska , except for a single bird seen sixteen years ago in the harbor at Buffalo , New York . At 9:35 A.M. on January 3rd , two bird-watchers were on the shore of Green End Pond , just off First Beach , on the border between Newport and Middletown . They were Hugh Willoughby , forty-four , a former educational consultant who is now a real-estate man , from Riverside , Rhode Island , and Robert Bushnell , of North Providence , who is a production controller in a manufacturing plant . Willoughby has been bird-watching for fifteen years . His life list of species observed is close to six hundred , which puts him in the top ranks of bird-watchers . Bushnell , who is twenty-nine and has been bird-watching for only four years , has a commendable life list of three hundred and twenty-three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but peaceful . Numbers of waterbirds  --  green-winged teal , common mergansers , canvasbacks , and various gulls  --  were riding on the open water of the partly frozen pond . They were all familiar species , readily identifiable . Then , momentously , Bushnell saw bobbing on the wavelets a bird that looked like a little white diving duck with a crested head . Since there is no such JANUARY 2 6 , 9 7 G thing as a little white diving duck with a crested head among North American birds , Bushnell exclaimed , " What the hell is that ? " Willoughby looked , and agreed that it was not an American bird . Finally , he said , " Damned if it does n't look like a sinew ! " For this inspired conjecture Willoughby is generally credited with the discovery of the Newport sinew , but he quickly and modestly points out that it was Bushnell who first spotted it . Willoughby had never seen a sinew , though he had once travelled all the way to Adak Island , in the Aleutians , where smews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one , both men were excited , but their emotion was tempered by the possibility that it was a tame bird that had escaped from an aviary . Willoughby hurried home to consult his bird books , which confirmed that the bird was a sinew . He called Charles Wood , the co-editor of Rhode Island . Field . Votes , with the news . From that moment , word of the sinew sped along the intricate communications network that links bird-watchers all over the country . The Massachusetts Audubon Society maintains a telephone service called the Voice of Audubon . Anyone dialling 617 ) 259-8805 hears a recorded message giving an up-to-date report of interesting bird sightings . There are similar rare-bird-alert systems in the New York and Washington areas . ( The New York number is 8326523 . ) In addition , bird-watchers are quick to phone colleagues and friends . Thus , within a day hundreds of people were aware of the little white bird on Green End Pond . For several days , however , the question of its origin remained unsettled . At first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild bird . Audubon people called all the waterfowl fanciers who might have lost a smew . Sinews are difficult to keep in captivity . It turned out that there were only eleven sinews in captivity in the United States , and they were all accounted for . European weather patterns were examined . A storm with hundred-mile-an-hour winds had swept into northern Europe just before the sinew arrived , and people speculated that as a result the bird could have been carried across the Atlantic by freakish air currents . Watchers also noted that the sinew had no band and was as wary as any wild bird . By the end of the week , doubts about its authenticity as a far-flung smew had vanished . We learned all this , and more , when we visited the sinew ourself , a week after the first sighting . We drove along the beach road , where a grassy embankment encloses one end of a large reservoir adjacent to Green End Pond . A long line of cars was parked beside the embankment , and the edge of the reservoir was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We scrambled up the bank , and a Siberian wind hit us in the face . A man muffled in a parka pointed out a distant white speck and offered us a view through his telescope . We saw the smew . It was the cutest little duck we ever saw  --  white , with a large black eye-spot , a crested head , and two black crescent bars on each side of its breast . Its outline was short and plump . Its neck arched in a graceful curve . The man said that the smew , a male , was only sixteen inches long and weighed less than two pounds . It is a merganser  --  specifically , Mergus albellus . The species is quite uncommon even in its home range . Suddenly , the smew bobbed its head and vanished , reappearing a moment later . There was a murmur of pleasure from the bird-watchers . Mergansers feed on small fish caught underwater . The smcw resumed floating . Watching , we were reminded of Dorothy , swept by a cyclone into the Land of Oz , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its small , plump form gave no clue . Shortly , when icy tears blurred our sight , we slid down the bank and went over to the office of the nearby Norman Bird Sanctuary to talk with its director  --  Lee Gardner , an ornithologist with a beard that looked enviably warm that day . Gardner said he had spotted the smew a few hours after Willoughby and Bushnell saw it , and had recognized it immediately , since he had seen sinews on the Black Sea ( where migrating smews appear in winter ) when he was a professor in Istanbul some years ago . He , too , had called the Audubon people , in some excitement , and he had been a little disappointed to find that they already knew . Gardner has his own theory of how the smew got here . He doubts whether it was blown over from Europe , and thinks it was a bird that had migrated eastward , as Siberian sinews do , into China . Thence it could have wandered on to Japan and to the Aleutians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smews show up in the Aleutians , and they have been seen as far east as British Columbia . On the Alaskan coast , the weather is relatively mild , but inland there are fierce storms . If the smew had been caught in one of these , prevailing winds would have carried it southeast into western Canada and diagonally across the United ? States to Newport . The past autumn was exceptionally mild , Gardner points out , and the sinew would have found open water in which to feed along the way . A smew must eat every thirty-six hours or it dies . " Other birds have crossed the continent from Alaska , " Gardner said . " Some experts do n't agree , but my theory is much more plausible . " What lies ahead for the wandering smew ? Will he ever return home ? Gardner thinks not . The cues that trigger migration in birds  --  hormones , day length , and weather patterns  --  would not induce him to fly either west to Siberia or east to Europe . Therefore , his exile is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new environment is not radically different from his home range . Newport is at the same latitude as portions of the smew 's normal wintering ground . His problem is isolation from his own species in unfamiliar territory during the coming weeks of freezing temperature . If the reservoir freezes over , as it may any day , all the birds must leave for open water . Some species can resort to the sea , but common mergansers and sinews prefer to feed in fresh water . The smew 's survival will depend on ? his finding unfrozen estuaries and ponds farther south . Ducks often find food by following old-timers who know the way . Fortunately for the smew , there are other mergansers on the pond  --  both the American , or common , merganser and the red-breasted merganser . ( The third native species , the hooded merganser , is as rare here as the smcw is in its home range . ) Perhaps the smew will recognize his American kin and follow them to new feeding grounds . Then , if he survives the winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshes and bogs of Canada , which are much like those of Siberia . But he will find no other smews . We asked Gardner if this meant that the smew is doomed to solitude as long as he lives . " Perhaps not , " Gardner said . " I am a romantic . I see an outside chance that our mergansers will tolerate him . He is the wrong color , but he is still a merganser and speaks essentially the same language they do . Who knows ? He might even find an American mate . Meanwhile , he is settling down very well . Eating frequently . Preening himself . Today , there was a very good sign -- he disappeared and came back . That means he is scouting and remembering . "
