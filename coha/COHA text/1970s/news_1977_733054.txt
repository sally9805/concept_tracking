txt IN THE FOOTWEAR industry , where fashions are dictated by cutting or adding an inch to the heel and pointing or rounding the toe , and where colors range from sand brown to two-tone purple , there is a brand that appears to have been unchanged since after World Wm . T  --  tim GT combat boot . ' It is perhaps the plainest but most comfortable , the ungainliest but most medically correct of all mass-produced footwear . And like the Volkswagen advertisement of several years ago , while the outside has remained unchanged there have been technological advances in the internal parts . Without glamor or advertising the United States Army boot has left its imprint in the muddy fields of Europe and the leafy jungles of Asia . MGR-LACED , government-Issue boots usually have some vague sentimental value to discharged American soldiers , especially those who recall spending hours hunched over them , shining them to a high gloss . Also , in the words of many ex-GIs , " they are damn practical . " A survey of almost any group of male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and years after filing away theindischarge papers in forgotten drawers . The boots were designed for the parade ground as well as the battlefield . The are made to stand up under all sorts of weather and wearing conditions , as many an infantryman who has lived in his boots for a week can well remember . NOW ARMY experts at the Natick Research and Development Command in Massachusetts are working on a new concept in GI footwear  --  two different boots , one for dress and one for the field . " In a two-boot system , " says Douglas Swain , a civilian footwear specialist at Natick , " the true field boot would not require shining . That requirement has always driven me up the wall . The last thing a soldier in combat cares about or wants is a shiny boot . " In the dress boot , the difference would be putting a little sexiness and style into it . " RIGIIT NOW , THE sexiest military footgear is the paratrooper boot with its stitching across the toe . It 's the height of military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Dr. William T. Xernahan , former Army orthopedic surgeon now practicing in Chicago . " The shape is well designed for the whole foot . In basic training during World War II even guys who had // Column 1 Army gets a boot out of foot research // never worn shoes before seemed to be able to adapt quite well . " Military boots have ranged from the immense footgear of the Roman soldier to the foppish chamois-lined fashion boots of 17th century France . But it was n't until the Civil War that any army  --  the Union army in this case  --  decided to issue its soldiers left and right boots . And it was n't until after the turn of the century that Gen. Edward Lyman Munson , an Army surgeon who specialized in morale and hygiene , came up with the " Munson Last " following a scientific study of soldiers ' feet . A last is the metal or wooden form shaped like a human foot over which shoes are shaped . MUNSON , WHO was born In 1888 , was a career soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Philippines . He was in charge of medical department training when World War I broke out . He wa8 also an author who wrote extensively on military hygiene as well as a 1912 piece , " The Soldier 's Foot and the Military Shoe . " So good was the army boot he designed that it was the one used through the 19305 and World War II and into the early 1950s when the Ft . Knox Last was developed . Using Munson 's technique , the Army took 28 different measurements of the feet of 10,000 male soldiers and came up with the Ft . Knox Last . Since then there have been further refinements . " Quite frankly the boot is excellent for the purpose for which it is Intendgl , " says Swain . " Of course you have to consider that we think in terms of the worst conditions possible , such as a man walk- ' ing with up to 165 pounds on his back . " ALTHOUGH IN THE Army the volume of business is not a measure of popularity , the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million pair and at the height of the Viet Nam War the Army was ordering 6 million pair a year . The Army pays about $20 a pair for the boots while some surplus stores , which normally stock Army rejects , have sold them for as much as $50 . And the special rubber Insulated Army boot which costs the government $55 a pair was recently selling In Alaska for up to $200 a pair . Such insulated boots , called " Mickey Mouse boots " because of their bulkiness , were developed after many frostbite problems occurred during the Korean War . They are now standard issue for assignments in Alaska , Greenland , and Korea . The most sophisticated type retains body heat In temperatures as low as 65 below zero Fahrenheit . After the Vietnamese experience , experts are also working on a better jungle boot that drains off water and dries quickly . " We 're always experimenting with new and exotic types of materials , " says Swain . " When anything new comes out in the civilian market , high heels or negative heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at it . " THERE IS AN Air Force zipper boot , but the Army frowns on it . " What happens if the zipper breaks ? " Swain asks . He is also dubious about pull-on boots " which are great if you have a lot of sizes available . " He believes the old nine eyelet Army boot Is still best . And while the research continues for a dress boot that will take a high gloss for Inspections , Swain says the Army is also considering a third type of boot ? this one for training . While the barefoot boys could adapt to boots 35 years ago , the current Armyage generation American youth Is suffering more and more from blisters and other foot problems . " A lot of them come into basic training wearing sneakers and jogging shoes and the other casual type footwear sold today . Besides that , " says Swain , " I guess people do n't walk very much anymore . "                   @ @
