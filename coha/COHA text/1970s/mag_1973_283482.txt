Obtaining a genuine peace in Indochina remains a Tantalus-like frustration , visible but just beyond reach . That was apparent last week as Henry Kissinger and North Viet Nam 's Le Due Tho met again in Paris to seek a way of implementing last January 's moribund peace agreement . <P> Kissinger landed at Orly Airport in a jovial mood , noting the " progress and cooperative spirit " that marked his talks with Tho before they recessed May 23 . At a reception at Paris ' George V Hotel , a perpetually smiling Tho assured guests that he was " optimistic . " From Saigon came cheering reports that Vietnamese and Western officials saw the time as ripe for movement toward a real peace . Official photographers and television cameramen were admitted to the first session , which opened Wednesday morning at the Communist villa in Gifsur-Yvette , a Paris suburb . At previous talks , the presence of the cameras had meant that agreement was near . <P> Then came a thunderbolt from Saigon . A spokesman for South Viet Nam 's President Nguyen Van Thieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked out between only Kissinger and Tho . Acknowledging that Washington and Hanoi can strike whatever deals they please in matters concerning only them , such as possible U.S. aid for North Viet Nam , Saigon insisted that it be present at any sessions where decisions were made affecting South Viet Nam . <P> Kissinger and Tho were apparently unprepared for these new objections . In Saigon , acting U.S. Ambassador Charles Whitehouse conferred twice with South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam . He also spent three hours closeted with Thieu at the Presidential Palace-one of the longest meetings since the ceasefire . Next morning , another government spokesman announced that the declaration of the previous day was " inaccurate . " <P> Rather than being unalterably opposed to any new agreement , he said , Saigon would remain flexible and would not commit itself either way . <P> Quite clearly , Thieu was worried that Kissinger would make concessions to the North Vietnamese that Saigon has long opposed . Saigon , for example , fears that the U.S. will not pressure the North to withdraw its military forces from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these elections until the North Vietnamese army withdraws completely . <P> Hanoi , for its part , still does not admit that it has troops in the South , although they are indisputably there . The Communists worry that if their forces withdraw , Saigon 's troops would invade Viet Cong areas , break up the V.C. cadres and arrest suspect Communist sympathizers-thus guaranteeing an election result favorable to Thieu . <P> Saigon also opposes any deal by Kissinger that would place a third , " uncommitted " party on the National Council for Reconciliation and Concord . Thieu insists that the council comprise only his government supporters and those of the Viet Cong 's Provisional Revolutionary Government ( P.R.G. ) .
