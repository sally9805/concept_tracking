txt ? All that glitters here in the California desert is not gold . Usually it 's broken glass , or a discarded beer can , or a motorcycle leaping over a sand dune . Strange as it sounds , some experts fear the desert is dying . The California desert covers more than 16 million acres of jagged mountains and sweeping plains , inhabited by small rodents that never drink water and with strands of drab cacti that burst forth with sudden slabs of color . This arid wilderness is really two deserts , the Mojave and the Colorado , stretching from the Sierra Nevada and Death Valley on the north to Mexico on the south , from the Colorado River on the east to the mountains surrounding Los Angeles on the west . The total area is as big as West Virginia . Once the desert was considered a barren , hostile place , the last barrier before reaching the Promised Land of Southern California . But today it is the great sandy backyard for 11 million people , a weekend refuge from Paradise-on-the-Pacific . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of the Interio ? , which supervises about three-quarters of the desert , put it this way : " Try to picture the California desert , not as a vast expanse of open space , but as a constantly shrinking landscape , surrounded by sprawling cities . " In 1970 , according to the bureau , the desert absorbed S million visitor days  --  one person spending one clay . Only two years before the estimate was 5 million . This weekend alone , as on most holidays , more than 100,000 are expected . And these visitors , as they have so often done elsewhere , are threatening to ruin what they came to enjoy . " Unless we act soon , " the bureau said in a report last year , " the desert faces damage and destruction because of people pressure . " Few believe that the desert should be roped off , that people in the crowded coastal cities should not have an escape . But planning , officials feel , is essential ; anarchy can only end , in destruction . " We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and yet keep the natural environment intact . That is always the rub . " The damage takes many forms : erosion of the land , destruction of vegetation and wildlife , the defacement of ancient Indian petroglyphs , the plunder of ghost towns , the loss of historic relics , and everywhere the mark of modern man  --  trash . A Fragile Environment " Everybody thinks of the desert as indestructible , " said J. IL Penny , state director of the land management bureau , " but it 's just the opposite . The desert is one of the most fragile environments we have . " It has been more than a year since the bureau warned of the imminent " destruction " of the desert , In that time , the spokesman conceded , it has " been able to do darn little " to stop the process . A ranger at the Joshua Tree National Monument south of Barstow said efforts to protect the desert " have been like throwing water up Niagara Falls , " The Bureau of Land Management has roughly one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly enough to patrol its vast domain . Moreover , the bureau has always been geared to supervise land , not people , and its agents have no training or authority to enforce the law . As a result , most use of the desert is completely unregulated . The desert is hardly virgin territory . It has been violated for years by miners , squatters , ranchers , and people who just wanted a convenient dumping ground for an old automobile . But recently , a much more serious threat has developed , the off-road vehicle . A novelty only five years ago , there are now 800,000 in the state  --  motorcycles , mini-bikes , jeeps , dune buggies , gyroplanes ? most of them within striking distance of the desert . What is happening to the land can be seen a few miles east of Barstow . Out here , ruts and gashes criss-cross the land like a child 's aimless scribbles . Every arroyo has become a freeway , and on weekends the more popular paths remind one of the beach roads on a summer Sunday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants , like casualties on a battlefield , white and stick-like , deprived of life-giving moisture . Some of the remaining bushes are festooned with unnatural colors : orange ribbons marking racing trails , bright blue paper blown away from some abandoned campsite now caught in the sticky branches . In the dry desert climate , even paper lasts for years . People often camp in large groups here , as if they were afraid of the desert or too used to cramped quarters to break the habit . And they leave their mark : an egg crate , a child 's sneaker , the rusting hulk of an automobile , so many bottle ca ; s and cans they almost look native to the region . The refuse serves one purpose  --  as targets for amateur riflemen . When they run out of cans and cars they shoot at signs and rest stations and rodents ; nothing escapes their tell-tale pock marks . " You get to the top of some hill and you think no one has been there in 200 years , " said Bill Halligan , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see a beer can . " The most drastic impact of the vehicles is on vegetation . " Desert plants are not rugged , they 're very delicate , " said Ranger Donald M. Black of Joshua Tree , who is a naturalist . " They develop very shallow root systems and wax and cork coatings to retain moisture , and once they 're broken , they do n't usually heal before they dehydrate and die . The right conditions for growth might not come again for 10 or 20 years . " Moreover , the vehicles compact the soil , causing the rare desert rainfall to run off quickly , rather than to percolate into the soil , And their tracks are practically indelible . Scars left by General Patton when he trained his African armed unit here during World War II are still visible . As people have Invaded new areas of the desert , the wildlife has retreated . The big horn sheep , which are very sensitive to man , " are like an encircled ' band , restricted and confined more and more , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As he talked , Ranger Sansum got a call from a colleague . A young coyote was dying near a campground , apparently from eating human garbage and waste . Another threat to wildlife are clubs of " varmint hunters " who track down coyotes , foxes and similar species . " There is a very delicate balance of nature between the varmints and other types  --  the varmints weed out the weaker animals , " said Ranger Black . " But for some reason these people feel they have a religious duty to kill varmints . I just do n't understand them . " One of the major results of TI , Now York TIrnos/13 . Garton Off-road vehicles , such as motorcycles , are a serious threat to the desert . Their tire marks crisscross the land ; every path becomes a noisy highway . the off-road vehicle is noise . As Ranger Sansum put it : " People pay $2 a night to camp where it 's peaceful and quiet . And then some dingaling comes in- with his motorcycle and does nothing but drive around and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has no thought that people might be tired of all that noise they get all the time . On a heavy weekend , this place sounds like the Culver City speedway . " Off-road vehicle enthusiasts talk about the " freedom " they have and the chance to reach once inaccessible areas . But those areas often contain Indian petroglyphs ? pictures scratched in the soft rock ? valuable archaeological sites , and remnants of the white man 's early days here . Many of these have been picked clean by rock hounds , bottle hunters , and plain vandals . One example Is a wooden plank road built across the desert by early pioneers . Most of it has now been burned for firewood . What lies behind this destruction , and what can be done about it ? Part of the problem is sheer numbers , and many officials feel that developing more facilities might make things worse , since they would only attract more people . Recently the Bureau of Land Management returned to the Federal Treasury $250,000 earmarked for a camp ground near Trona , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another part of  --  the problem is just ignorance , and the bureau hopes to get money for an educational program that would make people more aware of the limits of the desert . But the issues go deeper . Many people who come here are not concerned with the esthetic value of the area but its recreational potential , according to Ranger Sansum . " They want to know how they can use it ? collect rocks , or take plants , or drive over it , " he said . " And this is where we bang heads with them . " There is also a small group of openly destructive vandals , the type who burn privys and shoot up signs . " I do n't think they have a grudge against us , ' said ranger Black , " I think they 're striking out at their situation in life . They ca n't get back at their boss , or a cop , so when they come out here , with no restraints , they strike out at anything . " Last Labor Day weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand dunes stopped a train and broke its windows . When a county sheriff went out to investigate they chased him away . Officials agree that off-road vehicles must have some place to go ; so do rockhounds and bottle hunters , The problem , as always , is balance and planning , reconciling conflicting demands , establishing some order , preserving the land even while it is being used . Scouts Saving Painting A few things are being done . A Boy Scout troop is fencing off a particularly valuable Indian rock painting . Several large areas near here have been reserved for off-road vehicle use . But as Gordon W. Flint of the land management ? bureau office in Riverside said , " We have n't begun to scratch the surface of what 's needed . " What is needed , according to conservationists , is a thorough survey of the desert , a plan to allocate different areas for different uses , and enough manpower and authority to enforce the regulations . The bureau asked Washington several months ago for $28-million to pay for drafting a master plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . , But others add something ' else to the list of needs  --  a nevi attitude on the part of the public . As one writer put it : " Up to now men . have treated the deserts as if they made no difference . One of these , days , when survival can no ; longer be taken for granted on a crowded , used-up earth , theyi may make all the difference . ' , Time is probably the rarest ; commodity in this ageless place . ' With 11 million people " poised ? like some gigantic tidal wave , " : as the bureau put it , eager to , escape the smog and stress of daily life , crisis is a ? mild word. ; " We ca n't afford to wait five ' years , " said Mr. Flint . " Things like the petroglyphs will be , totally destroyed , rare animal ' species will possibly become extinct , the danger to desert , visitors who lack protection will increase . The beauty the California desert now holds will be diminished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Would you want to stand up to your neck in beer cans ? " .
