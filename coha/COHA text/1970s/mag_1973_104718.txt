How perversely appropriate that an event so burdened with hyperbole as " The Great Miami Air Race "  --  sponsored in part by the " Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce " and " Great Miami Air Race , Inc. "  --  should result in a personal triumph for two little old gentlemen in old little airplanes. // Air Race ? Great ? Words from another time . Nothing much is " great " anymore ; " super " perhaps , but almost never " great . " And is n't air racing something Richard Aden used to do ? Or was it Richard Dix ? Goggles and wind-whipped silk scarves . Oil spattering back into an open cockpit . A tailspin . " The stick , the stick  --  pull the stick ! " " You ca n't send a mere boy up in a crate like that ! " // Ah , but Miami is a community not easily cowed by a common anachronism . Lord knows , it harbors its share of old-timers . And few can fault it for paying homage to the air industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dutifully ferrying all those numberless senior citizens south for the winter . // Still , despite modern hoopla during the week , The Great Miami Air Race seemed pleasantly antique . The competing airplanes  --  aeroplanes ?  --  were propeller-propelled , jets being too big , too fast , too hard for the spectators to watch and far too expensive for the sportsmen who compete in such races to buy . Watching those marvelously maneuver-able biplanes , midgets and World War II fighters and trainers in flight was a bit like watching a pole vault with bamboo poles  --  the man , not the equipment , was the thing . The pilots themselves were mostly of middle age , men who as boys looked upon flying as an adventure , not a technical exercise , and the planes they flew last weekend were the stuff of which boyhood dreams were made . It was a backward flight into fantasy , and when a gargantuan National Airlines 747 was flown low over the runway of the New Tamiami Airport to show the time-travelers what giant steps forward we have made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminder of how gross we have become . // There are not many air races these days  --  four , maybe five , a year . This was the first held in Miami since 1950 and the first " international " race in the U.S. in 36 years . Actually , it was international in name only , for though they were invited no foreign flyers appeared and only one foreign-made plane was flown . The Great Miami Air Race was as American as Amelia Earhart . // The competition was divided into four classes : the Unlimited for modified old fighter planes , the AT-6 for vintage military trainers , the Biplane and the so-called " Formula I " for tiny planes built to racing specifications . These last , mere toys that looked in the air as if wires should be attached to them , quickly captivated the 70,000 or so spectators who turned out for the weeklong show . In these , pilot and plane are virtually as one , for the machine is not that much larger than the man . // A Formula I plane weighs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and has a wingspan of around 15 feet . They are powered by 100-horsepower engines and , astonishingly , can reach speeds of 250 mph or more in a straightaway . Formula I planes can be torn apart by strong winds and even menaced by large birds . Since they carry only five to 10 gallons of gasoline and consume about one gallon for every nine miles , they can neither be flown too far nor too high . // Their pilots tend to be quirky individualists who fuss like antique-car owners over their aircraft . They wear costumes , good-luck charms and call their planes by names  --  such as NO BIG THING and Therapy . Most of the men are over 40 and should know better than to risk their necks in , well , crates like these . // Probably the finest Formula I pilots are both older and presumably ( though not necessarily ) wiser than their comrades in flight . Bob Downey , a Whit-tier , Calif. paint manufacturer , and Bill Falck , a retired airport operator from Warwick , N.Y. , are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 years each and both operate planes that are about half their age . Last year they dominated Formula I racing , winning three of the four major events . Downey was the year 's top point-winner and Falck had the fastest winning time  --  227.2 mph. // Downey flies a plane , Ole Tiger , that is considered undersize even by the standards of this aeronautical Lilliput . Ole Tiger weighs 535 pounds  --  only 375 more than the pilot  --  is but 17.2 feet long and has a wingspan of 14.1 feet . The cockpit is so cramped that Downey can not wear ordinary flying headgear . Instead , and appropriately enough , he wears a Little League batting helmet . But he has flown this pint-sized plane at a top speed of 270 mph. // Still , Ole Tiger is not as swift as Falck 's Rivets  --  which is named not for the obvious reasons but after the comic-strip dog . In a trial heat last week Falck tied his own Formula I world record with a 232.2-mph lap . Rivets is a hundred pounds heavier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wingspan . Because of his plane 's comparative bulk , Falck is generally a slow starter who then pulls out of the pack and treats spectators to a Garrison finish . Downey is quick on the takeoff and nimble on the turns . He forces a race ; Falck waits to make his move . // The Falck-Downey  --  Rivets-Ole Tiger  --  duel was a natural crowd-pleaser , and the pilots did not fail their audience . Their several races were the most thrilling of the week . // Little planes are more fun to watch , if only because they are so much easier to watch . In Miami they flew on a short , three-mile course and were always visible . The Unlimited planes require an eight-mile course that puts them virtually out of sight  --  and occasionally out of mind  --  for much of the time . // In both the Friday and Saturday trials , Downey and Falck flew true to form . The red and white Tiger took early leads and , flying low  --  little more than 50 feet off the ground  --  clung close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Falck took the high , wide one . Winging last at the start of both races , he twice caught and passed Downey from above in the closing laps . Their times were nearly identical . In the six-lap Friday race , Falck averaged 219.9 mph , Downey 219.5 . Saturday , Falck was 220.8 , Downey 220.4 . In the one race Downey pleaded a tight engine , in the other a large and sluggish propeller . But he is more given to tinkering with his machine than alibiing for its failings . Falck is his friend , and he enjoys racing him almost as much as beating him . // Mostly , he loves flying his Tiger . " This plane fits you like a glove , " he says affectionately . " You do n't so much fly it as wear it . " // Downey , a short , friendly , florid-faced man , is as effusive as Falck is taciturn . " I think the rest of us will split the prize money , " he advised Falck before one race , " just by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know why it is that when you give me every chance with your starts , I ca n't take advantage of it . " // " Maybe , " said Falck , " you will . " He did not . Falck won the Sunday final easily , flash home at an average 224.5 mph while the tiny Tiger , buffeted by gusty winds , could only crank out 217.7. // How does one get started flying competitively ? " Well , " says Falck , " first you got to get yourself an airplane . And that costs money . " // That it does : Downey paid $10,000 for Ole Tiger nine years ago and , despite his winning , has lost approximately that much in the last three years shipping , repairing and maintaining it . // This , however , is a mere drop in the fuel tank when compared with the investments of the Unlimited pilots . Cliff Cummins , a Riverside , Calif. radiologist and consistently star-crossed flyer , estimates that he has sunk some $140,000 into his Mustang fighter in the years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air Force gunnery instructor , belly-landed the Mustang in the Nevada desert three years ago during the Reno air races after a small throttle link snapped . The very same gadget failed him on the sixth lap of the eight-lap semifinal heat in Miami on Saturday . Cummins was leading at the time and had recorded the fastest qualifying-heat time of 376.8 mph earlier in the week . // " I do not again need that sudden silence in the engine up there , " he confided nervously after he had coaxed his failing airplane into a neat landing . // Because of his outstanding times and because the plane could be fixed in time , his fellow pilots ruled that Cummins should be allowed to compete in the Sunday finals , but not for the top prize money of $8,055 . He could compete for glory and lesser cash consolation prizes . But , alas , he was denied even glory Sunday : this time his lap-counter broke and Cummins lost track of the race . When he finally made his move he was too far back and finished fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite his troubles , Cummins had greatly contributed to the dramatic success of the first Great Miami Air Race . And the little fellows , Falck and Downey , had made it an artistic success . In the end there was hopeful talk of this becoming an annual event . // But air racing is a hazard in the air and at the bank , and neither pilots nor planes are getting any younger . Downey sagely observed : " You never know what the hell is going to happen up there . " // True down here , too .
