THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THIS winter , two powerful Russian voices have made themselves heard around the world . One is that of Alexander Solzhenitsyn , whose account of Soviet forced-labor camps is now appearing in the West , and the other is that of Nadezhda Mandelstam , the widow of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam and the author of " Hope Against Hope " ? an account of her husband 's art and the last four years of his life  --  who , in an event of no less importance than Solzhenitsyn 's momentous act , has published what may be , in its own way , a new autobiographical masterpiece , " Hope Abandoned . " These two Russian voices speaking about Russia to Russia and to the world are like a fresh wind blowing through a closed room . They , and the voices of a few of their comrades , sweep away everything that the thousands of workers in the ministries of propaganda in the Soviet Union have been laboring to put across to the world for decades . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices of record , and will he heard and believed as long as there is a record . They speak directly to us in America  --  not only because of the universal qualit ) of their work but also because the United States is involved with the Soviet Union more deeply than ever before . Just recently , the global fuel shortage has drawn the two countries closer . But at root the bomb is what unites us . It clamps us together in common dread of extinction . Being clamped to the Soviet Union is nut comfortable . Unfortunately , the bomb unites us in America not with Mr. Solzhenitsyn and Mrs. Mandelstam but with Secretary-General Brezhnev . We like Solzhenitsyn and Mandelstam better , but Brezhnev has the bomb . And so it is he whom we welcome to the United States and put on national television , he who rides about in a Presidential golf cart , and he whose arrival at the White House is greeted by a fanfare of trumpets . We lay on the golf carts and the trumpets because we want to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out ) of detente , and detente is the first step on the road to survival . Our misfortune is that neither of the two men who hold the world 's survival in their hands has an acceptable vision of what kind of world it should be . President Nixon ( the leader of a free country that , owing to him , is in danger of losing its freedom ) and Secretary-General Brezhnev ( the leader of a totalitarian country that is trying to make sure that freedom stays lost there ) have both used detente as a rationalization for dictatorial measures in their own countries . Secretary-General Brezhnev has cracked down harder on dissidents at home , on the ground that in an era of detente the danger of infection with foreign ideas is greater , and now the regime has portrayed Solzhe n itsvn 's hook as a threat to detente . President Nixon has used the Middle East crisis  --  an example of detente , according to him  --  as one excuse for firing a special prosecutor who was looking into his affairs . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want are the Solzhenitsyns and the Mandelstams . It is they who , crushed under the weight of a totalitarian regime , have kept the vision of freedom alive . When Secretary-General Brezhnev was in San Clemente last June , meeting movie stars and other notables , he met the enormous American movie actor Chuck Connors . There was some friendly fooling around , and then , when the time came to say goodbye , Secretary-General Brezhnev suddenly fell into the actor 's arms , and they embraced . Connors lifted the SecretaryGeneral  --  no featherweight  --  about a foot of the ground . It was the most uncomfortable moment in an uncomfortable week . All of us in this country have only begun to think about the looming question of how to reconcile our survival with our liberty . For the moment , we may embrace Secretary-General Brezhnev , but it is Solzhenitsyn and Mandelstam whom we take to our hearts . Party AB E BEANIE , our new Mayor , went to a reception in his honor on his inauguration day , January 1st , and we were there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four thousand people turned out for it , and many of them carried their coats around , to avoid standing in a coat-rack queue . A sophisticated political lady identified the crowd for us . " It 's Queens and residential Brooklyn . I have n't seen more than three familiar faces in the last half hour , and one of them was Jack Dempsey . " She led us past the tables in the Grand Tier Restaurant , identifying appointees . " That 's Housing , " she said , " and that 's Budget toward the window , and Corporation Counsel over there in the corner . Those people , trying to save seats , are judges and their wives . " At the top of the house , in the Family Circle , we found a receiving line composed of the Mayor , City Council President Paul O'Dwyer , Comptroller Jay Goldin , their wives , the Mayor 's children , and Mr. Goldin 's parents . Five hundred people were lined up waiting to shake hands . A reporter nudged us and pointed to the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ste that character ? " the reporter asked . " That 's Jack Dorman , a politics 24 JANUARY 1 4 , 1 9 7 4 buff from Paterson , New jersey . He ca n't vote for Abe , and he did n't work in the campaign , but he 's been through the line live times . " Fa  --  ades Protected ON a recent morning , the Land-marks Preservation Commission , a cir agency that is trying to protect our architectural heritage from the bulldozer and the steel-and-glass tower , held a public hearing at City Hall to consider twenty-three new candidates for landmark status . The hearing was well attended from the official point of view nine of the eleven commissioners showed up ) , but the audience was sparse . We paused briefly at the door of the white-and-gold Board of Estimate Chamber to chat with Frank Gilbert , the executive director of the commission , and he told us about a few of the ground rules . " This will be our last public hearing on proposed new designations until 1976 , unless the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years  --  is amended 13 ) the Cite Council , " Mr. Gilbert said . " And that just might happen this afternoon . As a matter of fact , it did . Our present jurisdiction ? ? covers only the facade of a building . If the amendment goes through , we will be able to landmark publicly accessible interiors , such as the Custom House rotunda , as well as scenic outdoor areas , such as Central Park . " " The other important point in the proposed amendment is that it mandates publication of any advisor ) - commission report on a public ) owned landmark , " said a tall , tweedy young man , who turned out to be Kent Barwick , executive director of the Municipal Art Society . " If we 'd had this on the hooks in 1970 , it would not have been necessary for someone to ' leak ' the commission 's report on the Metropolitan Museum to the press . t would simph have been a matter of public record . " During the next two hours , twenty-odd speakers trooped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . For practical purposes , the speakers could he divided into three groups : ( ) enthusiastic pro-landmark people , such as Mr. Barwick ; a scholarly white-haired architect named Otto Teegen ; and Mrs. Rita Aid , the lively chairman of Community Board 7 , on the upper West Side ; ( 2 ) anti-landmark people , mostly lawyers acting for property owners who felt that landmark status would decrease the value of their investment ; ( 3 ) fence sitters , uneasy and apologetic men who explained that while they favored the landmark law in principle , they did not wish to see it applied to the buildings they represented . " I find myself in a most ambivalent position , " said Paul Lipson , a lawyer and trustee of the Ethical Culture Society , whose building at 2 West Sixty-fourth Street had been proposed as a landmark . " Our society has been in that forefront of social progress for almost a hundred years , and supported the founding of your commission . And yet our movement is now a small one , and our auditorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past ten years . On the other hand , our school next door is very successful and needs more space . We have considered replacing the present building with a taller one , and putting a co-op on top and the school and a smaller auditorium on the lower floors . But this would cost millions of dollars , which we can not afford , and the allotted floors would n't give us enough space anyway . " " Have you considered interior changes ? " asked Harmon Goldstone , who was the chairman of the commis- " It would be too expensive for us , " Mr. Lipson said . " There are all too few structures in New York which hear the mark of the Art Nouveau movement , " said Mr. Teegen . " Your building , which was designed by Robert D. Kohn in 1910 , has two powerful facades , both relatively simple in mass . It is an excellent example of a distinct school of architecture , and it should be preserved . " The commission proceeded to discuss three churches ( only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , favored landmark status ) ; the Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue , on Central Park West ( delighted ) ; the Old Calvary Cemetery Gatehouse , in Queens ( opposed by the trustees of St. Patrick 's Cathedral , on the ground that the cemetery might need more burying space ) ; the Huntington Free Library , in the Bronx ( requested more time ) ; several . private houses ( mixed reacdons ) ; a Transit Authority administration building in the Bronx ( " How this magnificent nen-Italian Renaissance , almost Tuscan building survived is a mystery to me , " said Mr. Barwick ) ; and Gaye &; Tollner 's restaurant , in Brooklyn ( " It would be ludicrous to preserve the modest Anglo-Itallanate facade and let that magnificent mirrored interior slip away , " said Mr. Barwick ) . Toward the end of the meeting , Mrs , Aid suggested that the commission was not moving fast enough on priority items in her district . " There are two buildings in great danger , " she said , " The Central Savings Bank at Broadway and Seventy-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We urge you to follow our list of priorities . " The final item on the calendar turned nut to be a strategic retreat on the part of the Frick Collection , a self-sufficient institution , which was bitterly criticized when it demolished the adjacent - Widener house last summer . Everett Fahy , the Frick 's y outhful director , told the commission that the Frick had abandoned plans to build an extension on three vacant lots to the east  --  a tract of land that includes the crumbling foundations of the Widener house . " We have decided to install a permanent architectural garden in this space and a narrow one-story wing extending from the wall of the Frick Collection , " he said . " Will the new wing diminish the size of the garden ? " asked Barbaralee Diamonstein , pretty , blond commissioner . " The proposed wing would decrease the size of the terrace but not the size of the garden , " Mr Fahy replied , carefully . " The Frick has mysteriously changed plans another time , " said Mr. Barwick , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must consider the whole of East Seventieth Street from Madison to Fifth Avenue . Stylistically , it goes from French to Italian classical to hopelessly eclectic . And yet it 's one of the most successful block fronts in the city . The Municipal Art Society strongly suggests that the entire block should be preserved as a landmark . " Backgammon N a Saturday afternoon , we speedily lost three consecutive games of backgammon to the world 's champion player , Tim Holland . Mr. Holland looks like James Bond  --  he is in his early forties , dapperly dressed , six feet three . He told us that until fourteen years ago he had excelled at every game xcept backgammon , a game he had never encountered until he happened upon some players at a fashionable Miami Beach country club . Since that day , Mr. Holland has won more backgammon tournaments than anyone else in living memory , and has been teaching the game to groups of up to sit students to the tune of three thousand dollars for four two-hour lessons . " With six students , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars , or sixty-two dollars and fifty cents an hour , " he said modestly . A former golfer  --  he spent his twenties doing the celebrity golf circuit in Florida  --  Mr. Holland once played backgammon for sixty-eight hours without a break , and he likes to stress the athletic nature of his favorite game , Sitting across from us , in his Manhattan apartment , at a large silver-edged table , on which he won the World 's Championship of Backgammon in Las Vegas three times running , Mr. Holland told us that he was the author of a recently published hook , " Beginning Backgammon " ? the first book designed expressly for the novice player  --  and the inventor of a new self-teaching aid called Autobackgammon . He went on to explain why the game had achieved such phenomenal popularity in the past few years , eclipsing bridge , gin rummy , poker , and canasta in many circles . " Backgammon combines the features of every popular game we 've known for decades , " Mr. Holland said . " It blends the pure luck of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Large element of personal judgment . The social aspect of it is beautiful  --  you do n't need to go to a club or set up a foursome . You can compete sn alone against your wife , or with an almost unlimited number of children or friends . Then , it 's so dean and candid : cheating is just about impossible ; no one is hid - ing any cards ; there 's no bluff , as in poker . It 's also very democratic and good for the ego , because , with occasional luck , beginners can heat the most advanced players . And , of course , it 's the most pacific game I know of it 's totally devoid of any clement of human aggression . You 're never 26 JANUARY I 4 r I 9 7 4 angry at your opponent , as in rummy , or at your partner , as in bridge . Whatever anger you feel is directed at the dice , at some abstraction of Lady Luck . " A brief perusal of backgammon history had taught us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian era ; that it was extremely popular in the Egyptian , Greek , and Roman civilizations ( the Emperor Claudius even wrote a book about it ) ; and that the Romans imported it into England , where it achieved particular popularity . It was known as " tables " in England until well into the seventeenth century , when the name " backgammon , " or " hack game , " from the Middle English " gamcn , " began to prevail . It was in eighteenth-century England that backgammon rules were refined into an approximation of today 's game  --  except for the use of the doubling cube , which was added only in the nineteen-twenties . Tim Holland elaborated for us on some recent aspects of backgammon history . " What we are witnessing is the popularization of one of the world 's most aristocratic and elitist games , " he said . " In the Middle . Ages , backgammon was supposed to be strictly confined to the ranks of the nobility  --  at the time of Richard the Lion-Hearted , for instance , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-nineteen-sixties the only backgammon tournaments were held on the club level  --  in very Wasp , exclusive clubs at that . The first major open competition was organized in 1966 , at the Cleremont Club in London  --  the International Championship of Backgammon . I won that in 1966 , 1972 , and 1973 . The first major tournament held in America was set up in 1967 , by a Chicago industrialist , Charles Wacker an enthusiast who had decided he wanted to democratize the game . It was called the World 's Championship of Backgammon , and it was held in Las Vegas , at the Sands Hotel . I also won that tournament three times  --  in 1967 , 1968 , and 1970 . It was n't held in 1969 . " Mr. Holland , who has accumulated some sixty thousand dollars a year in tournament money over the past few years , reverently held up a two-foothigh silver trophy he won at Las Vegas , which he said was purportedly a former yachting cup of Kaiser Wilhelm II 's . We asked him what he saw as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been trying to figure that one out myself , " Mr. Holland said . " I think it 's in part the influence of women 's magazines . Backgammon had always been such a ritzy , jet-set , beautiful-people activity , and throughout the sixties there was a trend to popularize and identify with the beautiful-people experience . It 's like movie heroes ' drinking Scotch instead of rye . Also , there may be a women's-lib factor involved . Up to the nineteen-sixties , backgammon had been exclusively a rrian ' . c club game , whereas this year over fifty per cent of the tournament players are women  --  it 's another one of those men 's activities that the women seem to enjoy taking over . " We ventured to suggest that the pacific , unaggressive nature of the game might be well suited to the placid character of the **25;4548;TOOLONG reaction against the agitated temper of the . sixties . " That 's very probable , and not at all farfetched , " Mr. Holland said . Having sat down to play with the Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , and Mr. Holland threw a three . liNe were immediately made aware that , as was n't the case with the game we learned at our father 's knee , tournament rules do not allow any refusal of the first dice . So we were forced to play this rather unpromising opening throw . Mr. Holland then threw a six and a one , and dosed his bar point  --  one of the finest opening moves of backgammon . Then we threw another wretched six and a three , leaving several " blots , " or dingle men , vulnerable to being hit by our opponent . After several more rolls , when his position had become almost insurmountable , Mr. Holland turned the doubling cube up to two , and admonished us to decline his double . " One of the most important and sensitive aspects of the game is learning to refuse doubles , " said Mr. Holland , who had managed to win a hundred and eighty dollars the first time he ever played backgammon by consistently refusing every double in a chourtte . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Vietnam  --  they think that refusing is admitting failure or defeat . That 's why backgammon is the greatest possible thing for the American psyche  --  it forces us to play a game in which you just have to lose very often . " As we disposed our men on the hoards for a second game , Mr. Holland 's sumptuous silver-edged table re minded us that the 1979- World 's Championship was being played in Las Vegas the second week of this new year . We asked the champion if lie was planning to participate in it . " Gosh , no , " he said . " I 'm tired . I 'm going to sit this one out . And , besides , I 'm having the time of my life writing a second book , this time for more advanced players . " In our final game , we threw a six and a one twice in a row  --  always too much of a good thing . Dead Ringer A : What do you know about poisons ? Himan Brown , experienced radio director-producer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the other day putting together an episode for " The C.B.S . Radio Mystery Theatre . " " The C.B.S . Radio Mystery Theatre " is the first new drama program to he produced for radio since the demise of " The N.B.C . Radio Theatre " ( also produced by Brown ) , in 1959 . It will he heard every night of the week all year long , and will run fifty-two minutes a night . One hundred and ninety-five original shows ( brand-new scripts , brand-new everything ) and one hundred and seventy reruns of these shows will , as it looks now , punctuate every single day of the coming year with Significant Pauses , Menacing Snarls , Husky Laughs , and other essential dramatic baggage . " The C.B.S . Radio Mystery Theatre " will he heard on WOR in New York , which shows you how the foundations of popular culture have been undermined ( by passivity and relativism ) since 1959 . " The N.B.C . Radio Theatre , " you can damn well bet , was on N.B.C . When we visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cast of a drama called " Dead Ringer . " He was reading the script of " Dead Ringer " with his actors and giving them cuts . No notes  --  just cuts . On Mr. Brown 's right sat Joan Lovejoy , who was playing Gloria Winters ; Larry Haines ( Al Grissom ) ; and Leon Janney ( Leo Winters ) . On the other side of the table were Bob Dryden ( Dr. Carmody ) and Paul Hecht ( Grafton ) . " Would you make a cut on page twenty-two , please , " Mr. Brown said . " Cut ' So let 's pack it in ' and pick up for me on twenty-three with ' We 've got to stop talking about murder . ' Then , on page thirty-one , cut Are you crazy ? This is no time for kissing .

" said Leon Janney . " One week , I kno-w I did fifty shows . " The beginning of " Dead Ringer " involved a number of sound effects  --  rain , for instance , and car noises . There was a hit of trouble in coordinating some of the cat noises . " Hold it , fellow , " Hi-man Brown said to Joe Cabibbo , the sound man . " We 'll go crazy with these car doors opening and closing . " What happens at the beginning of " Dead Ringer " is that Gloria Winters finds Al Grissom injured on a highway late 011 a rainy night . " You 're some dynamite kind of Good Samaritan , " Al says . Gloria says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly . " GLORIA : We need 1. o know more about poison mushrooms . The library go to . The actors performing " Dead Ringer " went straight through the script , on tape , without a pause . Only when someone actually mispronounced a word or lost his place was a speech redone . " Listen , " said Himan Brown , who was sitting in the control booth . " These guys are pros . Now , Hecht is young  --  he 's a Canadian actor . But everyone else here is a pro radio actor .

After the taping , Leon Janney said , " I was the man Helen Trent married . After twenty-eight years , she got married . That was the last show .

" Paul Hecht told a joke about actors . " The young actor says to the old actor that he likes acting , because he gets paid for acting , but Ito hates the standing around . The old actor says , get paid for standing around . I act for free . ' " Then the session broke up . " You know these guys arc working for scale , do n't you ? " Himan Brown said .
