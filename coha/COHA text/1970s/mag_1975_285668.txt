The name on the mailbox-New Alchemy Institute-suggests that the small Cape Cod farm is dedicated to the ancient quest for a way of transforming base metals into gold . In fact , the farmers are pursuing an equally elusive but more modern goal : alternative methods of feeding the earth 's billions without excess use of fertilizers and pesticides , waste of coal and oil , or reliance on the new hybrid grain crops , which despite their high yield are often vulnerable to disease . <P> That is the heady dream of the institute 's young founders , Marine Biologists John H. Todd , 35 , and William O. McLarney , 34 . Their crusade began in 1969 while they were teaching at San Diego State University . Between classes , they began looking into the prospects of cultivating fish and plants , and using wind and solar power directly instead of energy-wasting farm machinery . They called their experiment the New Alchemy Institute as a reminder of a time when science , art and philosophy were not considered separate or even antagonistic pursuits . Later Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution . Now both have left , and are devoting themselves full time to the new alchemy . <P> Located on twelve acres of leased land near Falmouth , the institute focuses most of its attention on a growing scientific concern : that the Green Revolution may be failing . As Todd explains it , the use of pest killers to maintain the revolution 's high-yield grains has triggered a vicious cycle : " Soils decline in quality , which in turn makes crops more vulnerable to pests or disease . This creates a need for increasingly large amounts of pesticides and fungicides for agricultural production to be sustained . " As a result , says Todd , he shares " the disquieting feeling that we are witnessing the agricultural equivalent of the launching of the Titanic , only this time there are several billion passengers . " <P> As one small lifeboat for some of those passengers , Todd and McLarney have created a prototype agricultural " ark , " a self-sufficient food-producing complex involving greenhouses , fish ponds , solar heaters and a windmill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an incline . The lowest pond contains a variety of edible fish , mostly the tasty tropical tilapia ( somewhat like the sunfish ) . Pumped by the windmill , the water from this pond is passed through a solar heater , then circulated through a bed of crushed , bacteria-laden shells in the topmost pond . The bacteria not only detoxify the fish wastes but convert the ammonia in them to nitrites and nitrates , which are used to fertilize algae in another part of the pond . <P> Full Diet . Then the algae-enriched water is fed into the middle pond , where the microscopic plants provide feed for tiny crustaceans called daphnids , or water fleas . Finally , water containing fleas and algae flows back into the bottom tank , where it provides a full diet for the tilapia . Nothing is wasted : in the warm greenhouse space above the ponds , the new alchemists grow vegetables even in the dead of the New England winter . The plants are fertilized by the nutrient-laden fish water . To protect their harvests against bugs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pesticides into the greenhouses .
