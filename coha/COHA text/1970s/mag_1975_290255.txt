In a mood perhaps too wishful , some top bankers have insisted lately that the OPEC oil cartel 's domineering note in the world economy would soon diminish . But last week Walter Levy , dean of U.S. oil experts , punctured that optimism . In a closely argued study , he contends that OPEC 's balance of payments surpluses-and high prices-will continue disrupting the global economy at least through the early 1980s . <P> Recent analyses by New York 's First National City Bank , Chase Manhattan and Morgan Guaranty Trust suggest that OPEC 's trade surpluses will peak around 1978 and actually swing to a deficit , perhaps of $56 billion ( Morgan Guaranty 's figure ) , by 1980 . But Levy , one of the most widely respected private U.S. oil consultants , estimates that by 1980 the 13 OPEC countries will still be pulling $50 billion a year more in oil revenues out of the rest of the world than they return through purchases of goods and services . By then their accumulated surpluses of foreign liquid assets will amount to a staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Levy does not believe the OPEC countries can increase their imports as rapidly as the banks assume . Morgan Guaranty predicts the OPEC countries ' imports will grow by 20% a year . Levy concedes that OPEC imports rose even more than that last year , but doubts the oil countries can keep up the pace . The thinly populated Arab states lack the expertise , labor , port facilities and inland transportation network necessary to handle that big a tide of foreign goods . In addition , many of last year 's imports were fighter planes , tanks and other highly destructive weapons , and there are questions of how much longer the Western nations will continue selling so much dangerous gear . <P> Levy also believes that the oil exporters will raise prices steadily , perhaps by as much as 12% this year and 7% annually thereafter . By 1980 he expects the key grade of oil to be selling for $14.65 per bbl. v. $10.46 now . Even if oil prices drop temporarily , he contends , the decline would fuel a boom in the industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase in oil demand that OPEC could put prices right back up again . <P> Coldly Realistic . In sum , Levy persuasively reasons that paying for oil will continue to be a burden , heavy even for the industrial states and crushing for the many poor countries that do not possess oil . He fears that attempts by each nation to cure its own deficit could lead to " a mushrooming of new barriers to trade " that oil importers would erect , not against OPEC but against each other . In his coldly realistic report , Levy predicts it will take at least three or four more years than the banks anticipate-or roughly until 1983-84-before the problem begins to diminish . Meanwhile , his latest analysis suggests no way out of the box . But he has previously voiced hope that a united front of oil importers could convince OPEC that it is not even in the cartel 's own long-run best interest to bankrupt its customers for the sake of earning high revenues that the oil countries can not profitably use .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
