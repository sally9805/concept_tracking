In a 90-minute interview with TIME 's Cairo Bureau Chief Wilton Wynn last week , Egypt 's President Anwar Sadat indicated his willingness - under certain conditions-to renew the mandate of the United Nations peace-keeping force for longer than three months and to consider allowing nonstrategic Israeli cargoes to transit the reopened Suez Canal . Excerpts : <P> ON THE U.N . PEACE-KEEPING FORCE . I had already agreed during my negotiations with Kissinger to extend the mandate of the United Nations force for one year instead of six months on condition that the disengagement agreement be fulfilled and the Israelis pull back . But after the Israeli rejection , that is past tense . I have made it three months because I want to send a message to the U.S. and the world , an urgent message . But at the end of three months , I will be ready to reconsider my decision if the peace process is being pushed and the momentum maintained . <P> ON REOPENING THE SUEZ CANAL . There is a security problem , but to show my peaceful intentions and to ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Africa and Asia-for world prosperity and for our own benefit , I am ready to take this risk and protect the canal . According to the Constantinople Treaty of 1888 , if there is a state of belligerency between Egypt and any other country , that country is not permitted to use the canal . Even if the Israelis ask for their cargoes to pass through in other flagships , we have the full legal right to prevent it . But when the canal is opened it will depend on the conduct of Israel whether their nonstrategic cargoes will be allowed to transit the canal . <P> ON EGYPT 'S REFUSAL TO SIGN A NONBELLIGERENCY AGREEMENT . We were ready to accept a text committing us not to resort to the use of force during the peace process . The difference between this and nonbelligerency is that if I had agreed to the latter while part of my land and other Arab land is occupied it would mean I am inviting the occupiers to stay . But agreeing not to resort to force during the peace process means we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> ON THE GENEVA CONFERENCE . <P> I do not want the Geneva Conference to reach a stalemate as a result of polarization . It could happen ; even Israel predicts it . But we seriously want to reach peace , and so I have made my suggestion that Western European countries like Britain and France and perhaps some Third World countries be invited . We want to get away from a situation in which the Soviets seem to back the Arabs and the Americans seem to back Israel and we reach a stalemate . With others invited , we get away from the cold war . I am also asking that Jordan and Lebanon participate . They are states in confrontation with Israel . We need them , because we are working for a lasting peace in the area . <P> ON PARTICIPATION OF THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION . Having them represented at Geneva by an Arab League delegation is a possibility . I am trying several approaches so that we wo n't come to a standstill . But finally the formula must be agreed on by the Palestinians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
