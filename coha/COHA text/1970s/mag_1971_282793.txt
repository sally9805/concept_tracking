In latter-day Venice , the Church of Ss . Giovanni e Paolo is a kind of glorious barn . It is some distance from the Grand Canal , and although it houses the tombs of 25 doges of ancient Venice , tourists come chiefly to see the equestrian statue by Verrocchio in the piazza outside . But like many another church in Italy , attended only by a desultory group of the faithful , Santi Giovanni e Paolo had its treasures dating from a more devout age . There were panels by Bartolomeo Vivarini and a glowing polyptych by Giovanni Bellini in a chapel to the right of the main aisle . <P> Bulky Swag . One night last week , somebody hid in the church while a sacristan locked up . When he left , the thief let in his team of accomplices . Working by the flickering light of votive candles , they pried two Bellini panels and three Vivarini panels out of their niches-no mean task , since the panels average 5 ft. by 2 ft. in size . Then , with their bulky swag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen garden of the sleeping Dominican friars who were the guardians of this treasure , and loaded them into a work boat . Then thieves and works vanished . <P> Unhappily , the theft is not unique . Only a week earlier , similarly clever thieves , helping themselves to Communion wine as they worked , made off with a classic Titian from the parish church in Pieve di Cadore , which was Titian 's birthplace . Both these recent burglaries are only the latest of an appalling series . In 1970 , there were at least 259 , resulting in the loss of objects cumulatively valued at some $48 million . In 1971 , the pace is up ; thefts are averaging one a day . <P> The baffling question is : What does a thief do with incredibly valuable , well-known art objects ? In the case of the Bellinis and Vivarinis , there is also the problem of bulk-each panel is as big as a kitchen door . How does anyone smuggle them through customs ? Who will buy them ? If bought , where can the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No hideaway ? <P> Dr. Rodolfo Siviero , who carries the title of minister plenipotentiary and chief of the delegation for the recovery of works of art , is convinced that there is a kind of art Mafia , masterminded by big brains in Switzerland , Germany and Italy . " The big boys wait for a statute of limitations to run out in a European country , in Latin America or in the U.S. They can wait as long as 20 or 30 years . " Others suspect that the burglars are merely common thieves who hope to get a couple of thousand dollars from an obscure dealer or fence . <P> Some kind of value can be put on the losses . But , as Siviero says : " You ca n't measure a piece of civilization like the Titian . His daughter modeled for the Madonna , he painted himself as the shepherd , it was done for his own family chapel . " On the open market , the painting might bring , say , $5,000,000 . But this is not the point . Money is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one can recreate the Titian or the Bellini.
