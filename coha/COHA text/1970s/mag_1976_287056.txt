No health measure is as widely accepted by the American public as the annual or semiannual physical checkup . Doctors and hospitals promote it . So do major health organizations . Many labor unions and corporations agree that periodic employee examinations serve everybody 's interests . Even Presidents dutifully submit to them , as did Gerald Ford last week on his 63rd birthday . Yet an increasing number of physicians have begun to question whether the ritual trip to the doctor is really necessary or practical . <P> The Annals of Internal Medicine , many of whose physician subscribers derive considerable income from checkups , recently published a critical diagnosis of the routine examination . Among other things , it suggested that the periodic exam may be just one more instance of " a tendency of the health professions to oversell prevention ... and to overvalue the benefit of their care to patients . " Acting on the advice of medical consultants , the Chicago board of education is scrapping annual chest X rays for all employees . Even leaders of the American Medical Association have joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general practitioner who boasts that he has not had a routine physical since he joined the Army in World War II , regularly asks patients who demand checkups : " What do you want one for ? Who says you need one ? " <P> Obvious Symptoms . Good questions , other doctors agree . Though regular checkups are important for spotting health problems in youngsters and the elderly or in people with obvious symptoms of illness , they appear to be largely unproductive for the vast majority of the population . For most adults , write Drs . Donald M. Vickery and James F. Fries in a health guide called Take Care of Yourself ( Addison-Wesley ; $9.95 , hardcover ; $5.95 , paperback ) , " even the most elaborate checkups ... do not detect early and treatable diseases with any regularity . " Dr. Russell Roth , a longtime Erie , Pa. , urologist and former A.M.A. president , concurs . In 35 years of routine rectal examinations , he reports , he has discovered in only one patient an ailment that lent itself to treatment . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. William Keith Morgan of West Virginia University 's School of Medicine , " patients are probably better off not knowing they are going to die of Huntington 's chorea or multiple sclerosis 15 or 20 years from now . " <P> Annual checkups are also under attack because they are time-consuming ( some stretch over several days ) and expensive ( up to $400 ) . Fries estimates that as much as $15 billion to $20 billion of the U.S. 's annual $118.5 billion medical bill is spent on routine examinations . <P> Despite their broadsides against annual checkups , doctors do not criticize regular examinations for certain types of illnesses ; some tests , in fact , do make economic and medical sense . For example , Vickery and Fries recommend routine blood-pressure tests for hypertension , inexpensive skin tests to spot tuberculosis , Pap smears for women over 25 to detect cancer of the uterus and cervix , and glaucoma examinations for people over the age of 40 if their families have had a history of the eye disease .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
