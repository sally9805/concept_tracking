Across America , crises over money , schoolroom violence and forced busing threaten to overwhelm the cities ' public schools . In Chicago and Philadelphia , the school districts are reeling under deficits totaling tens of millions of dollars . In New York and Los Angeles assaults on teachers and students were at an alltime high . In Washington and Richmond , so many white families have fled to the suburbs that the city schools are being left , de facto , segregated . <P> A.L of these problems-and some uniquely its own-are reflected in Detroit . Put bluntly , Detroit 's public education system is close to collapse . Though fourth largest in the U.S. , with 300 schools , 10,500 teachers , 285,000 pupils and a budget of $292 million a year , it is running $90 million in the red and may be forced to close March 15 , two months ahead of schedule . The system does not have the $73.2 million needed to operate longer . Chances that it will get the money are so slim that a fortnight ago the board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plight does not result from lavish spending . Its schools have been living frugally for several years , and more so than ever this year when $16 million was slashed from the budget . The schools now must get by with old versions of textbooks instead of buying new editions , and cutbacks have been made in such courses as music , art , remedial instruction and athletics . The teaching staff has been reduced by 350 to 10,500 , even though it means larger classes-35 pupils per class , about ten more than the statewide average . Teacher salaries now average $11,500 ; the average autoworker earns $12,500 . <P> New school construction has been halted , and existing schools are seriously overcrowded . Cass Technical High School , for example , was built in 1917 for 2,500 students ; today it has 4,800 . Space is so scarce that counselors meet parents in the high-ceilinged main office to discuss students ' private problems within earshot of anyone who happens by . For lack of a study hall , students spend free periods lounging in the graffiti-smeared corridors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of Detroit 's elite schools , housing the city 's top students in music , science and the arts . <P> Supply rooms have become as barren as Mother Hubbard 's cupboard . " There 's never enough paper , " complains a teacher at an inner city elementary school . " So far this year I 've bought ten reams of paper myself . It 's a matter of protecting your own sanity - when you see a kid without anything to do , you 've got to get him a pencil and a piece of paper . "
