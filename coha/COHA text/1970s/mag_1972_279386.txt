BERLIN TO BROADWAY WITH KURT WEILL <P> This show is an auditory feast , but everything except the music leaves something to be desired . Kurt Weill 's theater music is one of the glories of the modern stage-haunting , melodious , perfectly wedded to the lyrics . Such songs as Pirate Jenny , Alabama Song , My Ship and Lost in the Stars do more than fill an audience with pleasure . They are incarnations of beauty in sound . <P> The irritating thing is that the devisers of this production do not leave Weill enough alone . Arbitrarily , the show has a shipboard setting , and a tedious commentator . Donald Saddler has staged the numbers as if they were supper-club turns . The cast has fine voices , but the collective air of bouncy innocence somehow belies what is worldly , skeptical and melancholy in Weill 's mental tone . This is Weill without tears , and it misses the distilled suffering that makes some of his music so affecting . <P> One exception must be made . Margery Cohen bears witness to life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elly Stone , her voice contains pain , endures it , survives it . <P> While the Berlin section of the evening is less well done , it is more meaningful because Weill 's collaborator was Bertolt Brecht . Between them they fashioned a dramatic rhetoric of music and lyrics that moved with deceptive ease from the beat of the goose step to the glide of the tango . Decadence was their target , but they were half in love with what they hated ; Weill could decant sin from a saxophone . The music that he later composed in the U.S. somehow lacks that moral bite that Brecht inspired .
