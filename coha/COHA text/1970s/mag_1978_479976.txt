THE NATIONAL RELIGIOUS Broadcasters met recently in Washington for their thirtyfifth annual convention . It came as a bright spot in the capital 's otherwise rather drab calendar . At one time or another , the following people were somewhere to be seen in the Washington Hilton Hotel during the four-day meeting : Anita Bryant , Malcolm Muggeridge , Chuck Colson , LaBelle Lance , Eldridge Cleaver , MaraheI Morgan , and Larry Flynt . One had hoped that they might all appear onstage together at some point , but it was not to be . Larry Flynt was not invited to participate in the convention at all , but he showed up anyway and held a hurried press conference in the hall . He is said to have lost weight . The National Religious Broadcasters ' hierarchy was glad to see the back of him , but many of the press people covering the event were sorry that he was not allowed to join in the seminars , knowing as they did that Flynt had appeared on a local Washington television program a few days earlier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a church on a Sunday morning . Thus his participation in the proceedings would have had a salty , newsy flavor to it , and there was some disappointment Tom Bethell is a Washington editor of Harper's. that the vigilant evangelicals let the headline writers down . Eldridge Cleaver did n't speak either , although he was scheduled to show the world premiere of his movie The Eldridge Cleaver Story , and to take part the next day in a seminar entitled " Evangelicals in Search of Identity . " His nonappearance came as another blow to the style writers . Only a few days earlier he had shown up in Los Angeles " to promote a new line of risque men 's wear which he designed in Paris two years ago , " according to a release from the Evangelical Press . Cleaver was supposed to have put all that behind him . When he showed up at the hotel he was confronted by distressed evangelicals with this backsliding . He promptly went into an all-night intensive prayer session with Chuck Colson and Dr. Jarrell McCracken , who was understandably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waco , Texas , and is due to publish Cleaver 's new book , Soul on Fire , very soon . But Cleaver did not emerge the next day fully cleansed , in the view of the hierarchy , and he did not appear on the rostrum . For the smart news-media crowd ? more accustomed to dealing with pinstriped government officials ? the temptation to mock all this was very strong . Evangelical Christians , after all , represent that " other " America . Moreover , they are plainly aligned with that well-known enemy , the corporate world . Media/government versus corporate/ religious is a natural division of camps . Media people tended to view the convention much as the anthropology department of an important university might regard the gathering of an exotic tribe that happened to be conducting its weird rituals right on the campus . " They " were in town . Had one heard ? The religious people . Soulhunters but it might have been head-hunters . The reporters came with notepads at the ready , to study and record the strange goings-on . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media friend of mine asked , thus at the same time certifying her membership in the club of Correct Opinion . It was not so much a question as a shot fired from the trenches of our ongoing class war . Class . That was one of the principal questions that this convention raised in my mind . An issue , if you like , and one that 's not often discussed . But there it was . Religion is right at the cutting edge of class division in America today . Class lines are intended to exclude undesirables . Now that we live in a society dominated by the idea of equality ( enforced more and more every day by income transfers and government edict ) wealth no longer adequately selves to set up class divisions . All the more important . then , to set up social codes that do the same job in other ways . People who go around talking about how they accepted Jesus into their hearts ( on such and such a date ) , about how they have been " born again , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are telling us that they have not heard of the modern class code . In the same way , one notices that these people tend to wear brightly colored polyester clothes . Probably they eat Burger-Chefs-and-Taters , too , without so much as blushing . And you know they take their kids to Disney World . In short , they blithely ignore the class taboos that serve to separate the anthropologists from the tribes . In media/government Washington , I believe , these taboos are particularly important ( although they operate similarly within all large cities ) . Do I know anyone in Washington who regularly goes to church ? No , I do n't , although it is possible that some of my friends go secretly . In correct Washington circles , I believe . if you go to church you do n't exactly shout it from the rooftops . This is a striking turnaround from Biblical times ( and , I think , all succeeding centuries until this one ) , when conspicuous piety went hand in hand with social advancement ? so much so that Jesus Christ specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement , one of the few instructions from the Sermon on the Mount that has a superfluous quality in contemporary Washington . I DO NOT MEAN TO IMPLY that people in Washington ? or the more rarefied intellectual strata of big cities generally ? are unreligious . That could be far off the mark . It is just that almost any expression of religious sentiment is regarded as being a tiny bit embarrassing . Not " done . " This was confirmed for me by Michael Novak , the theologian and columnist , who happened to be in Washington at the time of the religious broadcasters ' convention . He told me about a poll that was conducted at Harvard University not long ago . People were asked ( a ) if they thought Harvard was religious-70 percent thought not ; and ( b ) if they were religious-70 percent thought so . They were hiding it , in other words . The class taboo against religious expression may well be growing stronger because there are now so many of them out there ? not just in the Bible Belt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves to demarcate a very small group of people . and so is suitably " exclusive ? ' At the same time , however , the great majority ( How many ? One heard the figure of 50 million " horn-again " evangelicals in the U.S. today ) are beginning to fight back against what they perceive as the godless minority . Shots are heard from their trenches , too , as became evident at the convention . Anita Bryant personified some of this . As she came onstage at the outset of the convention ? a swift flurry of drums , a dazzle of spotlights , a vivacious quickstep to the microphone , and there she stood , confident before a huge sea of faces ? it was hard to realize that she must surely be the most controversial woman in America today . I had n't realized the extent to which this was so until I mentioned to a few acquaintances that Anita Bryant was due to appear in Washington . I was planning to go and hear her , I said . Oh . Crestfallen and disappointed looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recently voted the " most admired woman in America " in a poll taken by Good Housekeeping magazine . At the same time , she is regularly excoriated , from public platforms and in the public prints , as a merchant of " hate . " That is war ? and again , class war . For example , Richard Cohen , a columnist for the Washington Post , used the word " hate " to summarize Anita Bryant 's message . Cohen 's sensitivity to the nuances of correct opinion is so finely honed that if he applies the word " hate " to Anita Bryant , then she must indeed be safely beyond the intellectual pale . She is the new Nixon . Nothing too bad can be said about her . Bryant , of course , campaigned in Dade County , Florida , against an ordinance intended to ban discrimination on the basis of sexual preference . That is , she campaigned against the theory that sexual preference constitutes a basis for claims to legitimate " minority " status . Bryant had a point , because sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlike , say , skin color ) . We are regularly told , for example , that 10 percent of the population is " and has historically been " homosexual , in which case one must presume that this large number of people is and has historically been exercising its rights ( e.g. , to housing ) . The issue raised by the Dade County ordinance was not one of rights but one of proselytization , as was confirmed from an unexpected quarter . While Bryant spoke at the Hilton Hotel , a " gay activist " rally was held down the street at DuPont Circle . There an activist shouted into the crowd : " Anita , enough of your lies , enough of your hatred .... Anita Bryant says we 're going to flaunt our sexuality . I say flaunt it , hell ! We 're going to scream it and yell it from the top of the tallest buildings in this land ! " Bryant has a much better case than all the name-calling directed at her would suggest , but for several reasons she has become embroiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her opponents cleverly cast the issue she raised in terms of " rights , " a totem word these days , before which all right-thinking people fall down in worship . ( Interestingly , Bryant has support from some black leaders w ho realize that the concept of rights is in danger of being eroded and stigmatized by its everwidening application . ) In addition , Anita Bryant did not take her stand according to the conventionally acceptable terms of discourse . If only she had said something fuzzy from the social sciences , perhaps some cushioned phrases about parenting , she might not have been drummed out of the club quite so hurriedly . But she did not . She quoted from the Bible , thus making things worse . She called homosexuality a " sin . " So there was no other course left but to accuse her of " hate , " or simply to laugh at her . Anita Bryant is not content to let it rest at that . She said at a press conference before the convention : " There are millions of born-again believers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tired of ourselves and our leaders being portrayed as bumbling squares , and our religious beliefs being mocked by immoral shows , comedians , and other showbusiness personalities . We plan to form a media and legal task force to monitor all communications .... " The media . They are next on her agenda . She 's sick and tired of " ultraliberal and militant-radical groups " who have managed to " cast fear into the hearts of our communications industries . " In this she was joined by Malcolm Muggeridge . Everywhere he went at this convention , Muggeridge , a former editor of Punch , columnist for Esquire , and frequent broadcaster , was joyously received by delegates from more than 800 religious broadcasting organizations ; and everywhere he went he castigated the media with all the zeal of an Old Testament prophet . No one seemed to mind , or even notice the paradox . Muggeridge has a most unusual ability to deliver jeremiads and yet somehow buoy everyone up with his cheerfulness . Rarely can anyone have forecast the coming Dark Age with such relish ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasting it for over a decade now , while it always seems to remain disappointingly beyond the horizon . Anyway , the media are the problem , Muggeridge reminded the broadcasters , and many of them seemed to be in agreement . Carl Richardson , chairman of the Morality in Broadcasting Committee , outlined a " three-point program of positive action . " One way of summarizing it would he to say that the plan is to get people to stop watching most network television . " Many Christians , it seems , " Richardson reminded the audience , " have forgotten that the same button that turns the television and radio sets on also turns them off . " This may seem like an ambitious undertaking , but the growth of religious broadcasting has been so rapid in recent years that almost anything could happen . According to Dr. Ben Armstrong , the executive secretary of National Religious Broadcasters , " We 're forming one new Christian radio station every week in the United States , and one new Christian television station every month . " NRB claims to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million radio listeners and 15 million television viewers . The new technology of cheap videotape reproduction means that evangelical programs can be easily syndicated without the aid of a network . The " ratings " for the most popular evangelical programs ? e.g. , Rev. Robert Schuller 's " Hour of Power , " carried by 150 television stations ? are said to be rivaling those of the " Mery Griffin Show . " Nevertheless , the evangelicals are annoyed at the networks because the networks wo n't show their programs . CBS News , for example , produces an hour of religious programming a week , distributing it free to CBS affiliates . But it is not the right stuff . " Tokenism , " Dr. Ben Armstrong told me . " Watered down . Generally it 's an academic exercise three or four guys discussing some social problem like highway safety . It 's not good . " E VANGELICAL BROADCASTERS ( and ministers ) are not at all interested in social problems . It would be tempting to read great political significance into the current evangelical revival in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five Senators and Congressmen on the dais as Muggeridge delivered his speech . But my impression is that that would be a mistake . The best known of all born-again Christians , Jimmy Carter , seems to have played down his evangelical utterances since assuming office ; although it is possible , I suppose , that he will revert to the topic as 1980 draws closer . I asked John Conlan , a former Congressman from Arizona with strong evangelical inclinations , what he thought about this . He admitted that Congressmen are beginning to approach him with questions . " What 's an evangelical ? " they ask . " How many do I have in my district ? " Still , it is unlikely , as some imagine , that this movement is going to be transferred into any noticeable shift in policy ( with the possible exception of the abortion issue ) . The message of evangelicalism is personal rather than political . In this , of course , evangel. icals echo the sentiments not of the Berrigan brothers or Rev. Robert Drinan ( Dem. - Mass. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , St. Paul , both of whom evidently regarded it as futile to try and change political systems . This also was the message of Alexander Solzhenitsyn. which was read out to the convention : There is in our days a prevailing and entirely wrong belief that the contemporary world 's dangers and disasters are the result of this or that political system 's imperfections . It is not so , however . The truth is that they all stern from the relentless persecution of the religious spirit in the East and from the fading of this spirit in the systems of the West and the Third World . It is not at all clear , however , that the religious spirit really is fading in the West . What struck me , after those few days spent at the National Religious Broadcasters ' convention , was that the expression of that spirit is merely unfashionable among a certain , relatively small sector of the population . But , you say , an influential sector ? That is not so clear either . In an age of rapidly proliferating communications media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position on the television dial is more influential than any one of several others . No doubt it is true that the sum total of " the media " is highly influential ; but , surely , the traditionally " influential " sectors of the media have become less so as the number of alternative voices increases . The New York Times " discriminates " against religion by failing to include most religious books on its best-seller list . But when one considers that the vast majority of people represented by the delegates to this convention do not read the New York Times , if indeed they have heard of it , the effect of this discrimination is not very noticeable . The television networks , it is true , reflect in many ways the attitude of the New York Times , but now , with the - number of television programs increasing rapidly , the influence of the networks appears to be waning , too . As Rev. Jerry Falwell , who broadcasts the " Old-Time Gospel Hour " over 329 television stations . told Roger Mudd of CBS : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has done more to turn this country toward God ... than any other one aspect of the propagation of the gospel in this century . " The electronic age is the age of the " electric church . " as Dr. Ben Armstrong calls it . This also really does appear to be the age of the common man ? a phrase that seemed doubly suitable as I watched one media camp observing another at the religious broadcasters ' convention .
