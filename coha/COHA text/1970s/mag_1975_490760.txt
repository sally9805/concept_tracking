THE NEW IOUi IV ? ? THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AMAN we know who describes himself as a semiliterate historian dropped by one day last week and delivered himself of a few thoughts . This is our transcript of what he said : " It 's all well and good , I guess , for men and women of civic virtue to rejoice over the recent assaults on the seniority system in the House of Representatives . Beyond a doubt , some of them were famous victories , and for this we should all be grateful . I must say , though , that I 'm sorry about what happened to Representative Wright Patman , of Texas . I 'm sure he was wrong in some of his judgments as chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Currency , but , as far as I know , no one has ever suggested so much as a trace of venality on Pat-man 's part . He was trying to crack the Watergate business long before anyone else got on to it . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowledgeable crank . Those Young Turks who shoved the old populist aside not only were being cruel but were probably making a mistake . Pat-man 's eighty-one , and perhaps that 's too old . Still , I think of Mr. Justice Holmes , who had all his marbles at ninety-three . I see that Wayne Hays , of Ohio , is being kept on as chairman of the House Administration Committee . That 's bad . Hays is a martinet , or , at least , so most congressmen say . Anyway , I 'd like to submit a brace of caveats . First , the seniority system appears to be a law of life . It is operative in many human institutions , including the family . Whole societies some American Indian tribes , several societies in Asia and Africa  --  are based on it . In the United States , we still honor the English rule of primogeniture , though less rigidly , of course , than the English . Then , there are all those foundations and lawyers screaming against seniority ; someday took at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " senior partners " and so on . And you 'll find the same thing in corporate management . Even on publications opposed to the seniority system in Congress , there are " senior editors " and " junior editors . " In the firm I work for , / know , age is honored in pay scales , the allotment of office space and furniture , and the deference shown the older people by the younger ones . And my second point is that only fools believe there is any connection between youth and talent . In the past , the system , as it has worked in Congress and most other legislatures , has produced some hideous miscarriages . Edward Hebert , now out as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , and his predecessor , the late Mendel Rivers , may have grown in unwisdom with the years . But I do n't believe that Hebert and Rivers constitute a majority . I can think of plenty of exceptions . I think first of the late Senator Robert Taft . Taft , as you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , but his years on the Education and Labor Committee taught him a great deal about public education , and midway in his senatorial career he did a hu n dred-an d-eighty-degree turnabout on this issue , and became a forceful advocate of federal aid to education . More recently , there have been some other striking cases in the Senate . Abraham RibicofF has : acquired enough knowledge over the years to become as fine an urbanist as any professional city planner or academician . Claiborne Pell probably could n't tell a trolley from a bus when he first got to Washington , but after fourteen years in the Senate he is , I imagine , one of our leading authorities on mass transit . I could go on , but I wo n't . I 'll just say this : Think of Sam Ervin . He 's the best argument against the juniority system I know of . " THE other day , we turned our television set on and heard New York State Assemblyman Andrew Stein , who has done much of the work in investigating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally , will turn out to be as big as , if not bigger than , the Watergate scandal . " Not long afterward , we picked up our paper and found a two-column headline that announced , " BERGMAN CERTIFIED WORTH WAS ALMOST $24 MILLION . " ( Bernard Bergman 18 a nursing-home entrepreneur and the major target of Assemblyman Stein 's investigations . ) That afternoon , we saw a headline that read , " DISPUTE P , ERGMAN ON WEALTH DATA . " On other recent front pages , we read of other investigations . At the national level , there was the investigation of the C.I.A . and the investigation of the F.B.I . Several existing committees of Congress would be looking into these , and senators were said to be competing vigorously for a place on the special committee that was being set up to look into the C.I.A . Closer to home , there was an investigation of a " major educational agency " an outfit called the Institute for Educational Development  --  for mismanagement of funds , and there was a story on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And in the Wall Street Journal we read a story about a journalism professor who had trained her entire class as " investigative " reporters by sending them out to " compile lists of the surrounding county 's most reversed judges , its biggest slumlords , its heaviest political campaign contributors , and the business interests of its pin:mingand-zoning-board members . " There was something in all this that bothered us It was not , as Senator John Stennis said in the debate on the makeup of the special Senate committee to investigate the C.I.A. , that the inquiries now going forward were likely to destroy worthy institutions . Nor was it , as one columnist maintained , that a new wave of " McCarthyism " had been unleashed . The investigators had , on the whole , been scrupulous . We had not seen a single fact that we would not have wanted uncovered . What bothered us was not the stories themselves but the way they were being handled . In part , the problem was the idea  --  implicit in the big headlines , and explicit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bigger " than Watergate  --  that the new headlines would fill a gap left by the tapering off of Watergate headlines . We wanted the investigations of scandals that have come to light more recently to go on , but perhaps with a little less fanfare . Watergate the word we now use to refer to about three-quarters of what went on in the United States in the last five years or so  --  was many things . It was a nearly successful attempt to subvert Constitutional democracy from within ; it was a mass of governmental and corporate corruption ; and it was one of the best stories ever to find its way into American journalism . It is this lest , and least important , aspect of Watergate which seems to he emphasized by the prominence of the new investigative stories . It is as though the country , having developed an appetite for sordid secrets , now had to he fed a steady diet of them . At the moment , the mode of the journalism , rather than the content of the story , often seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page or its prominence on the television news : if it 's " investigative , " it gets heavy play ; if it 's straight " reporting , " it gets Tess play . Of course , in the time of Watergate it was the substance of the stories , and not the way in which they were uncovered , that gave them their importance . The prominence of the new investigative headlines has the odd effect of seeming to diminish the importance of the Watergate headlines by placing the Watergate story and the new stories on the same footing . And at the same time attention is drawn away from present storks that are of larger importance . These stories the economic predica-ment of the world , the energy predicament , the food predicament , the troubles in the Middle East , and the new difficulties in our relations with the Soviet Union  --  are a mass 44 confusion , but they are out in the open .

Dick showed us a French newspaper piece about him  --  the subtitles were " Le Chaos , " " L'Acide , " " Le Suicide , " " Les Machines , " " La Societe TotaliFEBRUARY 3 19 7 5 tairc , " " La Paranoia .

As for the cosmologies , this is what emerged from our discussions : cosmologies all seem to he based on repetition --  you know , first the universe expands , then it contracts , then it expands again , etc. ? but maybe that 's not so . Maybe this whole expansion business that the universe is currently embarked upon is going to happen only once . That would mean that every day really is a new day , right ? Also , maybe it 's not true that Einstein was smarter than Newton . Maybe Newton 's laws accurately described the universe as it then existed . But since then it 's expanded and got more complicated , and can be accurately described only by Einstein physics . Which will eventually become outdated , maybe .

Ca n't wait to breathe that N.Y . air . The Wedding Cake PEOPLE getting married get sentimental . It happens to everyone , not just to girls and boys you sometimes see wandering hand in hand , in their best jeans and custom T-shirts , between the Royal Worcester and the Limoges on the third floor of Tiffany 's but to marrying grownups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many old marriages they have put behind them . The fact is that people getting married generally end up amazing themselves , amusing their friends , and bringing tears to the eyes of their maiden aunts by their odd behavior . Take , for example , the couple we know who , after several years of domestic but not , strictly speaking , legal bliss , recently decided to get married ( his second , her third ) . They turned helplessly sentimental within minutes . They demanded that William Greenberg make their wedding cake . Now , William Greenberg , Jr. , is to wedding cakes what Henry Purcell w .. s to wedding music or Edmund Spenser to the epithalamium . He is an Old Master of the mixing bowl and the icing gun , an artist of the pale , shaded rose , the standup squiggle , the classic fluted edge , and the fine white line of frosting . There are days when people who want to pick up a few schnecken or a simple chocolate cake can not get past the door at Mr. Greenberg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town , but Mr. Greenberg himself holds court at the one on Third Avenue and Seventy-eighth Street  --  because so many passersby and local children have stopped in to watch him decorate a wedding cake . Like most great artists , he is at his best before an audience . And so we knew that he would not object if we stopped in to watch him make our friends ' cake , and to ask a few questions . We were just in time . When we arrived at the shop last Monday afternoon , Mr. Greenberg , icing gun in hand , was bent over a display counter filled with butter cookies , about to squirt the first fine vertical line of icing onto the wedding cake . The cake , standing on the counter , was two tiers high and was dressed , as it were , only in a thin white camisole of whipped cream  --  a bride waiting for her wedding gown . Mr. Greenberg himself was dressed for work , in a short-sleeved checked shirt , blue pants , and an outsize baker 's apron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lorty nine years old and getting bald , but as freckled and gangly as a boy . In fact , he looked to us a little like a grown Huck Finn who had been civilized somewhere along the way by the ministrations of a loving Jewish mother . He also looked like one of the most fulfilled people we had seen in years . We watched him work for a while , applying his perfect lines down each tier of the cake and then latticing the cake with loops of horizontal ones . Then we asked him about the cake , which had been baked that morning in a big gas oven in the back room , and learned that it was made of thin layers of yellow sponge cake and filled with a whipped cream laced with brandy , pecans , and a special coffee extract from Colombia . " I 'm very partial to this recipe , " Mr. Greenberg told us . " It has an aristocradc air about it . I 'm opinionated about the cakes I make . I do n't like fruitcake , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer this sponge . I used it for my own wedding cake . My cake served fifty people . I made it in the morning and got married in the afternoon . That was almost twenty years ago , and I still use the recipe whenever people ask for something very traditional , very sentimental . I call it my Madison Avenue Victorian number . It has as much the air of a proper wedding cake as anything I 've seen . You know , wedding-cake tastes vary . Anything is normal when people arc getting married . Some want their cakes very schrnalzy , some very eccentric . It 's not surprising about your friends , though . People who have been married before do tend to get traditional . Not that a chocolate wedding cake ca n't he traditional . I get a lot of requests for chocolate . I do a chocolate wedding cake with pale-yellow and white flowers , and you 'd he surprised  --  that 's a very classic look . But on the whole it 's the kids  --  first marriages  --  who want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not the other way . tround . One young couple I know  --  the cake f made for them was cut on the sand , on a beach in the Hamptons . You see , they were getting married to the rising sun . Now , they were a chocolate-cake couple . So were the couple who asked for an Art Deco wedding cake . I made them a cake that was a kind of cross between 2 Tiffany lamp and Radio City Music Hall . A wild design . Chocolate loops radiating from the center of the top layer , some filled in with mustard-yellow icing , some with a kind of mustard-green , some plain . Still , my favorite request came from a prong girl who said , ' 1 want tin Italian Renaissance chocolate wedding cake for a hundred people . Make it so ugly it 's beautiful . ' Well , that 's what she got . " Mr. Greenberg
