THE Administration 's economic policies are headed for a critical test this week : the start of the Christmas shopping season . Besides their importance to retailers and manufacturers , holiday sales are a sensitive gauge of the public 's mood . The pace of production and employment for months to come could well be determined by how many shoppers pick up that extra gift or two . All the experts have been carefully waiting for the tightfisted U.S. consumer to start spending again and thus lead the economy to the " great year " that Richard Nixon has promised for 1972 . <P> The prospects are relatively bright . Says J.C . Penney 's President C.L. Wright : " We think that Christmas sales will be pretty darn good . Not a boom , but better than last year . " Ralph Lazarus , chairman of the Federated Department Stores chain , sees a sales increase in the fourth quarter of 12% over last year or , excluding price increases , a real growth of 91% . Otto Eckstein , a member of TIME 'S Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales for Christmas will be about 9% . Including inflation , a First National Bank of Chicago study reports that sales for Christmas and the first half of 1972 will climb by as much as 12% in chain stores and by up to 20% in discount houses . <P> Sales are already quickening . Department-store volume jumped during October and early November by 14% over the same period last year . Buying has been brisk on the West Coast , the Northeast and in the South , but rather spotty in the Midwest . Partly as a result of the housing boom , which lifted sales of higher-priced , higher-profit items like appliances and home furnishings , durable goods sales are up a hefty 31% from November of last year . Clothing sales are also strong because the old mini-midi-maxi battle is over , opening the way for more apparel sales to women . More important , because double knits and other new fashions are catching on , men have been buying more clothes this fall than last . <P> Saving Less . Fully half of the rise in total retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year more than 10.1 million U.S. and foreign cars will be sold , up 16% from strike-stalled 1970 . Ford and Chrysler officers predict that next year will be equally strong . <P> At long last Americans are putting less into their savings accounts . The savings rate dropped from 8.2% in the second quarter to 7.7% in the third quarter . The decline was partly due to a slowdown in the growth of personal income caused by the wage freeze . People did not get their expected raises , but they continued to spend at least as much as before , and so saved less .
