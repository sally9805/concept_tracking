Congress acts to save the automaker from bankruptcy <P> It is the most extravagant Christmas gift a bountiful Uncle Sam has ever given a U.S. company . Just before recessing for the holidays , Congress last week agreed to extend an extraordinary $1.5 billion loan guarantee to the ailing Chrysler Corp . and sent the measure to the White House for Jimmy Carter 's signature . The gigantic bailout , dwarfing the $250 million Lockheed loan guarantee of 1971 , is designed to save from bankruptcy the nation 's third largest automaker and tenth ranking manufacturer ( 1978 sales : $13.6 billion ) . With Chrysler 's losses mounting daily , its 1979 deficit is almost sure to exceed $1 billion , the gaudiest splash of red ink in U.S. corporate history . <P> While Washington may have given Chrysler a reprieve and preserved jobs for its 137,000 employees in an election year , the action may be a dangerous example for a system in which the right to fail is as enshrined as the right to succeed . Moreover , if Chrysler can not make a U-turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans , the U.S. taxpayer could get stuck with a portion of the $1.5 billion tab . Assessing the action of his colleagues , Senator Barry Goldwater , the Arizona Republican who is a leading advocate of keeping government out of the private sector , called the bill " the biggest mistake Congress has ever made . " <P> The measure , however , is far from a pure giveaway . For one thing , the loan guarantee is not a handout but simply the Government 's pledge to reimburse private parties for the money , up to $1.5 billion , that they lend to Chrysler if the auto firm is unable to repay the loans . This promise should enable Chrysler to return to the money markets that have been closed for the past year . The automaker , moreover , will pay the Treasury an annual fee of at least 1% of the sum guaranteed . <P> Chrysler will be eligible for the federal guarantee only if it raises $2 billion on its own from sources specified by the legislation . From domestic banks , financial institutions and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in new loans that would not be covered by the Government 's guarantee . Because the fate of Chrysler 's suppliers and dealers is so closely tied to that of the automaker , Congress insists that they contribute $180 million by such means as buying stock or extending loans . Similarly , the states and cities that benefit economically as the sites of Chrysler plants must kick in $250 million . An additional $300 million is to be raised by selling more of the company 's assets . ( Chrysler has liquidated more than $400 million of its holdings this year . ) <P> On top of this , the key requirement imposed by Congress is the contribution from Chrysler 's workers . Although its blue-collar employees have already agreed to forgo expected wage increases amounting to $203 million in the next three years , Congress insists that an extra $259.5 million be cut . This will force Chrysler and the United Auto Workers to renegotiate the contract that they concluded in November . Said Senator William Roth , the Delaware Republican : " Our proposal would have to be ratified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " White collar employees will also be hit ; their wage packages are to be trimmed by $125 million .
