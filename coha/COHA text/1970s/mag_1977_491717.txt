" When you 're on top , you make yourself a target . Everybody takes potshots at you . Maybe they 're jealous ; maybe they 're just marksmen , and since you 're easy to hit , they let go a few salvos . " It is an understatement to say that Farrah Fawcett-Majors is very visible these days . The hair , the teeth  --  all real  --  flash across screen and magazine with the insistence of an aspirin commercial . Among the missiles fired off at the actress are that she is losing her hair ( " Farrah could have extremely thin hair within a year  --  even be bald -- if she keeps on blow drying it and rolling it up in a curling iron , " says Louis , a New York coiffeur who used to rake Farrah 's mane ) ; another that she was accused of shop lifting in San Fernando Valley seven years ago and put on probation and a third that she is leaving her husband , SixMillion-Dollar man , Lee Majors  --  for a woman .

" Can she cope with these disasters ? " I 'm a fanatic about staying in condition , " she explains unnecessarily . " I rattle around on the bedroom floor for 20 minutes in the morning when I get up 5:00 a.m. doing hip rolls , side bends , 60 sit-ups she repeats that one at night after jogging for a mile , touch my toes , kick , jump rope , side straddle hop .

" There 's a cut-off clause in my contract when I 'm working on the lot , " she says , " but on the three days when they shoot on location it can go on to midnight . " Reason ? The great expense of setting up equipment away from Sound Stage 8 at 20th Century-Fox .

When you have just a few hours to sleep and you get tied in a knot over something that 's upset you , it shows up the next day and the next . One day we were out on location in Los Angeles and these boys  --  maybe they were 9 and I0 ? got on the Forrrah continued from page 54 like being theirs but at this point Lee and I do n't go out much .

" I do n't play in any pro-am celebrity tennis and golf tournaments anymore because if I miss a shot it seems a big disappointment to the image , " he says . The Majorses have been married for four years and together for seven . " I like to cook for him , " Farrah says . " But I 've come a long way from the time I was doing only television commercials . Lee would go off to work at dawn and come home after dark . I 'd get together a really nice dinner and then he 'd call to say something was wrong at the studio and he could n't get home on time , and I 'd pout , ' You mean , after I cooked this terrific meal , you 're going to let it spoil ?

I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever got to the point of having to choose between marriage and a career , I would say that meant my marriage was on the decline anyway . When you really love somebody , I do n't think competition enters in . Lee is happy for me and proud of my success . The very same way I feel for him . " The 1973 wedding was unabashedly romantic . Farrah , her arms weighted down with lilies , her famous mop covered with a floppy leghorn straw hat , trembled down the aisle in the Hotel Bel Air toward Lee in a Mr. Clean white suit with orange blossoms pinned on his wide , vaguely Southern , lapels . There was a quotation from Kahlil Gibran on the wedding invitation : " It is when you give of yourself that you truly give . " A picture of Farrah and Lee , almost like a staid Victorian couple , added just the right touch of schmaltz . The Majorses live in a Bel Air house decorated with Chinese rugs , French provincial furniture , good reading lamps , unpretentious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it . There is none of the sense of impending career doom , of " spend , spend for tomorrow we head back to the dinner theater " desperation about the house . " I do n't think she is obsessed with being the perfect consumer , " says a friend . " She has excellent taste and really loves beautiful things , but she does n't require them to be happy . She prefers a kind of understated simplicity . " Other American sweethearts strike a note of familiarity . Mary Pickford was shyly amused by her image , poked gentle fun at herself in her masterfully comic movies . Yet she knew the value of the image and what it could do in terms of making her rich , and to an artist , what is more important , permanent , indeed , immortal . When she was a teenager , D. W.

" Mary signed on and unleashed her delicious sense of pantomime and gentle mockery on the American public . When she sensed she was n't getting her share of the expanding pie , she said to Griffith , " You said I 'd be making a million dollars before I was 21 . Well , be 20 next month . " One can imagine her fluttering her eyelashes , toeing the ground with her dazzling white shoes , and hugely enjoying herself as the original high priestess of a new art form . Then there was Marilyn , the tender vulnerable cotton-candy sex goddess who exclaimed , " Sex symbol ? I thought symbols were something you clanged together when you wanted to make a loud noise , " and could never understand that the public and the press agents and the money and the ogling could be deadly if they got inside you . She , this Monroe , wanted to be an actress . She wanted to be chosen for ability instead of looks . Farrah wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People want to see me in a certain way . I understand that . Still , I think deep down every actress would like to do a role where she does n't wear makeup , where she is accepted on her acting alone . I do n't fool myself about my acting talent . I know I 'm not great . I was n't blessed with that kind of ability , but I think I 'm getting better . I think I can become an actress . Television initiates you into the discipline of being an actress . You have to memorize lines , you have to get up for roles , you must work with other people , you learn to listen to a director , how to be on stage with another actor without being a dead blob but without trying to steal the scene . " Television also has a fleeting quality about it . Stars from shows in the Sixties have evaporated with their roles . Seasons come and go . Television shows never show up in movie houses but movies run again and again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Farrah 's first star movie will be good . Nobody will let her down , she feels , as long as she keeps up her end . It will be like Barbra Streisand 's A Slur Is Born . For months before  --  even for years  --  the news trickled out of Hollywood that Barbra was a tyrant , that her 7F hairdresser-lover was no producer : Writers , directors and other actors quit by the demi dozens . And as a tribute to the profession of movie-making , those same " employees " were the first to admit it . La Streisand had made a decent film , had brought honest tears to audiences and won herself an Academy Award as a songwriter . " Everybody tried extra hard on the picture , " said a writer for A Star Is Born . " Good was n't good enough . Streisand was bitchy , but she did n't ask any more of anybody than she gave herself . I 'm not unhappy with the results ! " Farrah does n't have Streisand 's voice . Or her kinks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol . Fit , fast , almost electronic . Whereas Marilyn 's psychoses endeared her to the troubled Sixties , and Mary 's anti-sentimentality pepped up the post-saccharine days of pre-world-warishness , Farrah stands for the **38;4008;TOOLONG Seventies . A poll conducted of thousands of high school girls listed Farrah as the woman they would most like to become . Madame Curie and Eleanor Roosevelt should n't feel especially bad though ; Marie Osmond was second , followed by eight television stars including Cher ( 8 ) and Kate Jackson ( 10 ) , Farrah 's other mobile sleuth with Jaclyn Smith on " Charlie 's Angels . " The boys said they liked Lee Majors most . Why ? " Because we 'd like to come home toher . " Is this such a condemnation of American youth ? After all , Rosalynn Carter is dowdy . Eleanor Roosevelt was n't much fun . Mamie Eisenhower devotes herself mainly to bridge . Queen Elizabeth , that perennial favorite of what-I-want-tobecome lists , operates in a remote sphere . And even Her Majesty admits to watching " Kojak . " Television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few 19th-century people who remember growing up without it , but for children born in the Sixties , and the Seventies , it has been baby-sitter , mother , father , Saturday companion , teacher , preacher , back alley ( for learning about sex ) , doctor , historian and friend . If anyone ever had any doubts about the possible delights of Farrah 's life , consider the children of actors and actresses today who are actors and actresses . It used to be that an actress would shield her daughter and son from the glare of publicity , the " agonies of stardom . " Now , it seems inconceivable Chastity Bono will grow up to be anything but Tatum O'Neal . Life is too short to be a lawyer or a doctor or a teacher . Hollywood seems to be much happier with itself . It is no longer a pink bubble . It is a realistic , hard , businesslike dream and easily as serious as anything else in our lives . We have been told the White House , now and past , manipulates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond belief . And for what ? At least the images of Farrah and her " Charlie 's Angels " and all the other super tubers are for fun . Fifty percent of the homes of the brave are tuned in to Farrah 's series . She works at being the person her viewers delight in . " I do n't feel right , " she says , " if I do n't get in a tough set of tennis or my mile every day . And I know I look better if I feel good . " " And that means , " her husband says , " that she wants to live up to the image young people have of her . " Of his own image he says , " Kids have n't had a clean-cut all-American hero for years . I 'm humbled by my part as the Six Million Dollar Man . ' This can lead them into good , basic , all-American things like football . I think my image is good enough to uphold it . " Farrah had a quiet , Catholic upbringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful in her class in high school in 1965 . She dated a football player at the University of Texas and she went to Hollywood and was discovered by " Charlie 's Angels " producer , Barney Rosenzweig , after several years ( that 's right , kids ! years ) of bitty bit parts . She has been on parade grounds before . " You hear so much about Hollywood being a jungle , " she says , her green eyes leveling , " and that everyone who enters it becomes bitter and disillusioned . I 've been lucky : Almost everyone has been very kind to me . " But she can drive a hard bargain when the weather cools in Tinsel Town . Item : When she wasasked to do a spot on " The Captain and Tennille , " she said there was a fur coat she 'd seen she liked and wondered whether $7,500 would be okay as the fee . Tennille 's producer was trying to get the other Angels too , so he said yes . When it seemed the other two Angels were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say she had misread the label on the coat and the price was $9,500 . Sherman Adams , you should have been living at this hour . When she appears in the coat , a cushy sable with deep collar , one is reminded that she does n't need it . On the other side of the couturier coin , Farrah has on several occasions refused to don a bikini on the show , saying , " When the story line sags and they just want to beef up the looking with a body , I say no . " Her fees run between $3,000 and $5,000 a show . She and Lee would like to do some of their own production . They know that 's where the money is , and they would like to let their talents range a little wider too . Movies . Specials . Farrah has had to do a lot of the promotion of " Charlie 's Angels . " " I 'd like to have some time , " she says wistfully . The couple has been planning a baby  --  Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow Kentuckian  --  but each time a break in their careers has prevented the family . " There 's more to me than hair and teeth , " says Farrah . " I 'd like a chance to prove it . " She shows her sense of timing and ? 4 comedy with her hairdresser , Hugh York , who is credited with creating " the look . " " Wow , look at those teeth , " he says . " Too many , " she says ; " any more and I could race at Hialeah . " She will have trouble playing the dumb blonde . Garbo had a great sense of comedy . And Marilyn Monroe , whom Farrah thinks of as the most beautiful woman she ever saw , worked dazzlingly well with comic directors like Billy Wilder . Farrah defies packaging . She is not a product . The famous poster of her , braless , deliciously thin , hair wildly free , hit the charts at three million copies . But she is very real . She performs on television with none of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel after they 've reached a certain pinnacle , all they have to do is be there . And she 's working hard at improvement . She 's not thinking , " Would this be best for me ? " She 's thinking ( and doing ) her best and working at upping that quotient . Psychologists are writing about Farrah much in the way they wrote about Mae West and Diana of the Ephesians . Blessedly she sees the humor in what they are saying , and in the image of herself . And other women see the possibility of themselves in Farrah . " Farrah created her own look , really , " says York . " It took her five years . " Nobody doubts that it was worth it , this cosmetic soul-searching . She is 31 ram , at the top of her beauty . She has everything , including the brains to know she 's got to keep pushing the carrot of success farther and farther out in front of her .

" It 's called ' The Fonzie Syndrome , ' " Winkler reports . " Children have started wearing glasses and eating liver because of The Fonz . I 'm used as a teaching skill , " he laughs , throwing up his hands . " I do n't know , " he continues softly .

It is now consistently among the three top-rated shows on television , and will undoubtedly maintain that position during its forthcoming and apparently final season . All , it seems obvious , because of one Henry Winkler . " I used to fantasize about being a star , " Winkler admits . " I mean , who wants to be small potatoes ? If I 'm going to do something , I want to do it ! " An amused smile comes and goes as he recalls a favorite dream of glory . " I was on the ' Dick Cavett Show ' several times in my head . I played both parts . I was very clever . I asked some of the greatest questions you ever heard in your life . And the answers  --  you should have been there for the answers !

Or it will absolutely wash you away . " He sits back , his eyes troubled , remote . " It is so powerful . It has a life of its own . It 's almost as if you become enameled in this suit of success . And you must be centered . You must have your own thoughts , you must be your own person . Or it will pull you in so many different direc-tions ?
