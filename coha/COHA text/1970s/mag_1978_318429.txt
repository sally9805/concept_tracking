Tax Revolt <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> The passage of Proposition 13 in California is beyond any doubt the political event of the century , and Howard Jarvis June 19 has proved himself a leader to be reckoned with . I nominate him to lead a crusade for constitutional fiscal restraints on our spendthrift , irresponsible , inept Congress . <P> William C. Morrison Jr . <P> Oklahoma City , Okla . <P> <P> The voters of California have spoken all right , but " tax revolt " is a little too noble-sounding for this irresponsible initiative . Given the opportunity , " the will of the people " would probably be to eliminate all taxes . Let 's not make heroes out of selfish , ignorant voters . <P> <P> Paul Bollwinkel Fair Oaks , Calif . <P> <P> The tax revolt is just what the doctor ordered for a chronic case of national fiscal obesity . We 've finally realized that the way to control the Government monster is to cut back on its diet of our money . <P> <P> Dick Scar Buena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have had to use a meat ax on the tax structure if the politicians and bureaucrats had not been using a scoop shovel to distribute tax money . <P> <P> Clem Stretchett Joseph , Ore . <P> <P> By all means , let 's return to those thrilling days of yesteryear ... 1932-37 ... few taxes and low assessments . Ahhh , the good old days ! Horse biscuits ! <P> Frank Horcajo Glendale , Calif . <P> <P> California 's tax-relief measure will ultimately fail-not because of the quality of the idea itself , but because the original opponents of the measure are now the ones asked to implement it . Essential , rather than nonessential services will be the first to be cut and the I-told-you-soers will soon begin their chorus . <P> <P> Lawrence A. Brown Chester , N.H. <P> <P> Unless rents are cut proportionally to reflect the landlords ' lower tax bills , it is possible that you will see the first statewide renters ' strike in the nation 's history . <P> <P> Peter Rodman Davis , Calif . <P> <P> An M.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard June 19 should have been a Doctor of Medicine rather than a Doctor of Letters . He has diagnosed America 's illness and prescribed the proper treatment . <P> <P> Bill Marden Madison , Wis . <P> <P> Perhaps the younger generation in the Soviet Union has not suffered enough to develop that intense spiritual development of which Solzhenitsyn speaks . Otherwise why are so many of them willing to risk arrest for their materialism by exchanging icons or other family heirlooms for blue jeans , pantyhose or albums of " intolerable music " by the Rolling Stones ? <P> <P> Thalice Goodridge Rockport , Me . <P> <P> West Bank Conflict It 's so " nice " to see in your story " West Bank : The Cruelest Conflict " June 19 how much you care about the " poor , dispossessed and abused " Palestinians . What about the hundreds of thousands of Jews who were forced to leave their homes in the Arab states ? Have Jews become blind and insensitive to the suffering of others ?           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
