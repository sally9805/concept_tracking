txt Although Charles de Gaulle had a long record of disagreements with the United States and made no secret of his fear that American hegemony threatened to dominate the world , he came to believe by the end of his long political career that major differences between Washington and Paris were near an end . On Feb. 14 , 1969 , two months before his resignation , he had his last long talk as chief of state with this correspondent . Until now the content of- the conversation has been held in confidence  --  it was off the record  --  although he gave permission to take extensive notes . He looked fit , better than ever , although several times during a talk of almost an hour he had small spasms of coughing . Even if he had a cold , it did not seem serious . His skin was ivory pale but healthy . His eyes had a piercing , wicked , shrewd look . He took off his glasses , but his eyes bored right into his visitor . He seemed to have lost some weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was really an ugly old map but had a very winning way and he talked with immense selfassurance . As always he was keeping all his options open . He took no trouble to disguise his growing feelings against West Germany and was clearly frightened by the increase in German power . He thought it had been a mistake for France to join the Americans and British in supporting Bonn 's desire to hold elections in West Berlin . De Gaulle talked swiftly , with great concentration , persuasively and with a complete mastery of what he had in mind , as he shifted from topic to topic . President Nixon was due to arrive on his only state visit to de Gaulle . Asked whether he felt that a new Administration in Washington would make it easier to improve French United States relations the general replied : " I think this process had already begun before President Johnson left office . Our relations were starting to get better during the last months of his Administration , and for natural reasons . But right now it is even easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a question of Presidents but of the problems posed . " For us the principal question between our countries was NATO . But now that is all over . Now it is no longer a subject for discussion ' as far as we are concerned . There is no NATO for us French so there is no reason to have a problem on this with Washington . " ? By this de Gaulle meant that France was no longer in the NATO " organization " although it remained a partner in the ' North Atlantic Treaty . ' It Will Lead to Peace ' " Then there was Vietnam , " he continued , " but President Johnson started negotiations while he was still in office . The negotiation is bound to go on for a very long time . That is inevitable . But it has started and , in the end , it will lead to peace . " There is no reason for major differences between us now . Our problems are on - the road to solution . Of course , there is the question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you on this since 1967 , but you should remember that this is merely a reverse of the previous situation . " With the Fourth Republic there was also disagreement . You were against France and Israel . in 1956 at the time of the Suez invasion for reasons that are . ' just the contrary of our differences now. , . Now the United States is with Israel , which . wishes , to take the Suez Canal . The United States has changed its policy  --  and so has France . " We agree that Israel should exist and should . be a state ? but not in an exaggerated way . The situation in the Middle East is not good today and it is not soluble along the lines Israel wishes . On this subject perhaps Nixon can draw closer to our policy . " Reverting to a possible improvement in United ' StatesFrench relations , de Gaulle said : " There is another aspect to the whole problem  --  namely relations with Russia . Little by little you are becoming ' more like us in your view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Want to have them submerge Europe . But you are beginning to see that it is useful to develop prac tical contacts such as those we started . You will follow the same path that ye have been following because that is the practical approach . Long U. S.-French Amity With regard to the two superpowers he said : " We have always favored the United States . Historically , we have always been friends . We have been rivals before . Remember , in the past you were in Africa , in Asia or even in Europe . " Also you should remember that we have old reasons for being friends of Russia . For us , in Europe , this Russian friendship has always been necessary as counterweight to Germany . Constantly in history , we have sought to be on good terrns with Russia , with - the Czars , with the Soviets , as a counterweight to Germany . We have been old friends with . America and old allies of Russia . " Today we have no reason to renounce friendship with the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , any reason to break off with Russia . " " And another thing , " he went on , " something you should never forget , is that one must always remember what France was historically , just after the war and what it is today . France is as it is. and the French are as they are . If the French do not think . of France , it disappears . But you can not think of France if you lose a sense of independence . The friendship , of the French for the United States requires no American hegemony . - " The same is true of Russia . It is for that reason that the Communists have never succeeded here ; for national reasons , not for social reasons . " About . Britain and Italy " As for Britain , " he said , " Britain has renounced its independence . It has sold it off for advantages of all sorts . And Italy counts for very little . " Asked if the ultimate aim of his policy was to neutralize the Mediterranean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied : . " The Mediterranean is open to everyone but we think that the concentration of a big United States fleet and the appearance of ' a big Soviet fleet do not constitute anything good for peace . " However , if an international d  --  tente can . brought about , there will no longer be any reason for a permanent United States fleet stationed in the Mediterranean . And at that point that ? would reduce the reason for the presence of a Soviet fleet . " On the question how long American troops should remain in Europe , he said : " Until there is a real East-West d  --  tente , it is obviously normal to keep American troops in Germany . But if there is a real detente , there would be no more reason for such detachments except for symbolic units . But the fact that ' you have , troops in Germany now does not irritate us ; so have we . " . Conversation in Moscow The general was reminded that the official Soviet account of his conversations with Stalin In December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy compels Frenchmen to desire first of all mutual-assistance pact with the Soviet Union . " Asked if that was still true , he answered : " When Germany is a danger , yes . If there is a German danger , we would have to have an alliance . You must remember how much both Russia and France suffered from Germany . If Germany were to become a big power ' militarily , economically and in a nuclear sense , we would have to have an alliance . Neither of us can accept a dangerous Germany . " Asked if he thought it feasible to ? work out a compromise revision of the world monetary system , ' he spoke for a few moments in a way that suggested that he was getting just bit beyond his depth . He confessed ? rather disarmingly : " Of course , you know , I am not a great expert on these ' things . " Nevertheless , he plunged ahead , speaking of gold as the world criterion for the balance of payments between states and saying that a common value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its value has to be increased . Neutral Stance in ' Mideast Again discussing the Middle East , he indicated that the French considered themselves neutral as between the Israelis and the Arabs , in the sense that they would support either side if attacked by the other . ' ' " In 1967 I told Israel not to attack , " he recalled . " I also told the same to the Arabs . We told both sides that we would hold either one responsible if it attacked the other . " A question about Nigeria and the Biafran civil ? war , then going on , led to a discussion of Canada . " There is a French people there , " he said . " They do not want to be anything else . There is also an English people , and in the West there is ' a people that is almost American . " They must make tp their own union on the basis of reciprocal engagements on such things as defense or currency . But to pretend to make English law on the Wks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just . It would be better to accept a. state of Quebec in a union of , Canada . "
