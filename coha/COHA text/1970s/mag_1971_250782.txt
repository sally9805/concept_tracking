Disowning Richard Nixon , his right-wing former supporters carefully point out , is a decision reluctantly reached . After all , one does not toss off an old ally and champion without shedding tears for what once had been . But the moderate tone of Richard Nixon 's presidency-while not liberal enough to satisfy critics in the center or on the left - has so disturbed many of his conservative backers that he appears to be in some danger of alienating a constituency he has counted as his for 25 years . Welfare reform , cutbacks in defense spending , advocacy of deficit spending and Keynesian economics were difficult enough for Nixon 's conservative supporters to tolerate , but for many , rapprochement with Communist China was the final straw . In recent weeks , right-wing spokesmen have announced a formal split with the President : <P> Twelve gurus of the right , editors and officials of conservative groups headed by National Review Editor William F. Buckley Jr. , expressed their " personal admiration " and " affection " for Nixon , then said : " In consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nixon Administration , have resolved to suspend our support of the Administration . " <P> Human Events , a Washington-based weekly that is a barometer of far-right thinking , pointed to years of backing Nixon candidacies , but added : " We fear that the President is not only advocating policies at almost total variance with conservative sentiment on the domestic front , but his ' generation of peace ' diplomacy , coupled with his seeming unconcern about our rapidly deteriorating military posture , is literally endangering the survival of the American Republic . " - William Loeb , ultraconservative publisher of the Manchester , N.H .. Union Leader , reminisced about the old Nixon , then washed his hands of the new : " The publisher and Mrs. Loeb are very fond of the President and Mrs. Nixon personally , and we thoroughly enjoyed our recent dinner at the White House . We found the Nixons to be fine people . But the first consideration is not personal friendship . This newspaper considers President Nixon 's proposal to visit Communist China and the change in policy toward Red China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger for the survival of the United States . " <P> Early Birds . The hard-core right wingers have never been well organized nationally and are generally dismissed by politicians as fringe extremists . But the voices raised against Nixon could influence a wider range of voters who stand to the right of center . The danger from the right could easily be overestimated , but Nixon for one did not ignore it . He called his older lieutenants on Capitol Hill-the " early birds " who helped him resurrect his political career for a run at the White House in 1968 - for a cocktail party last week . They included John Tower of Texas , Paul Fannin of Arizona , Robert Dole of Kansas . They met for an hour , exchanged cordial remarks and received presidential gifts . The same day , Nixon held another meeting , this one with New York Senator James Buckley . Neither would discuss the details of the meeting , but the President more than likely sought to answer affirmatively the question Brother Bill had posed about him in a recent magazine article : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
