IN Covent Garden , Bizet 's Carmen was performed in total darkness . In Soho , a resourceful strip-club owner issued flashlights to his patrons so that the show could go on . A TV mystery went off the air just as the detective was saying " The person we want for murder is . . . " Parliament debated , and the Queen took afternoon tea , by candlelight . Millions of homes were without heat , electricity or hot water for long periods , and whole areas of London resembled the capital during the wartime blitz . Darkness and gloom had descended on Britain because 125,000 Electrical Trades Union ( E.T.U. ) workers had decided to stage a slowdown . It was so effective that at any given moment during the week a quarter of Britain was without electricity . <P> At first there was some sympathy for the normally reasonable , well-led electrical workers , who were using the slowdown to try to gain a wage increase of $13.92 over their current average weekly earnings of $57.60 .

" One of the few signs of support came from unionized workers at London 's Evening Standard who walked out and halted late editions in protest against a drawing they considered objectionable . The cartoon pictured the E.T.U. worker as " Homo-electrical-sapiens Britannicus , circa 1970 " - with head of " solid bone , " eyes " green with envy , " ears " deaf to reason , " mouth " permanently open , " hand " always out , " and only a hole where his heart should be . <P> During the blackout , beleaguered Britons also had to endure a 24-hour nationwide strike by 350,000 workers protesting the government 's proposed Industrial Relations Reform Act , which comes up for debate this week in the House of Commons . The Carr bill , so named for Employment and Productivity Minister Robert Carr , aims at legally preventing wildcat work stoppages .
