txt The first known Sicilian revolt against the Mafia has taken place in the Lipari Islands for sound business reasons . Last year , about 1 million tourists visited Lipari , Salina , Vulcano , Stromboli , Panaria , Alicudi , and Filicudi-40,000 to Filicudi alone , which previously lived off fish , capers , and goats . But the exile of 15 suspected Mafia leaders to Filicudi at the end of May , along with an escort of 250 carabinieri , to guard the big shots ( " pezzi di novanta " in Italian ) from an enraged populace of 200 , may have put an end to this summer idyll , at least for the present . For a time after the arrival of the 15 unwelcome guests in regulation dark glasses and shiny Dacron suits , the inhabitants of Filicudi were seriously thinking of rolling rocks from a nearby peak , down on the unfinished Sirena Hotel , where the exiles and their guard are billeted . But softer hearts prevailed and , breaking quarantine , some of the islanders even passed fresh bread and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called them , because they could n't stand to see them eating canned beef . Italians still tend to think that a man eating out of a can has sunk about as low as he can go . // *Mafiosi start musical islands ' // Within several days , however , the islanders decided that the most dignified form of protest was mass evacuation . They boarded up their doors , nailed shut their windows , and took the boat for Lipari , where a special fund had been set up to feed and house them . Money has been pouring into that fund from Italian emigrants as far away as America and Australia . The refuges spend a good deal of their time in an amusement park riding on mechanical cars . ( There are no roads on Filicudi . ) But both the Lipari Islanders and the suspected Mafia leaders have been howling about the injustice of this enforced residence on an island no larger than five square miles . Both have a point . The islanders ' case is obvious . But the " big shots " make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confine persons to areas , such as islands , in Italy , if they have been convicted of no crime . The most that can be done is to exile them from places where they might cause trouble . In this case , the 15 suspected Mafiosi have been exiled from all of Italy except Filicudi . With the population gone , this is no longer a vacation , but a penal island . " We 'd rather be in jail , " one of them said . " At least we 'd have company . " Carabinieri get KP Even the carabinieri have a beef . With the population gone they-have to do all the cooking and , presumably , the dish washing . But on another rock , Linosa , in the Pelagie Islands , where another 18 suspected Mafiosi have been sent , the picture is. rather different . Last year Linosa had just 800 tourists , and then only for a couple of months in the summer  --  the cheaper sort at that . The new visitors to the island seem likely to stay all year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The biggest of the " big shots " on Linosa , Angelo La Barbera , almost monopolizes the island 's only telephone , calling his wife and his children and his lawyers . " Obviously , he is a family man , " the islanders are beginning to say . The influx of journalists to this little-visited island also is looked on with favor . " People are hearing about us for the first time , " a villager says . " Marbe they 'll learn how beautiful the island is , and how quiet , and what good fishing there still is around here . " know nothing ' As for the Mafia ? Angelo La Barbera shrugs his shoulders and a smile spreads across his face . " I do n't even know what the Mafia is , " he says , drinking a tiny cup of coffee with his little finger raised . " I do n't even know if it exists , this Mafia I know nothing . Nothing . " Perhaps few people on Linosa know that La Barbera is charged with several kidnappings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragment of a bullet in his skull to show for it . But if they 'd had 40,000 tourists last y'ear the chances are they 'd be up in arms like the people of Filicudi.
