txt In a vote crucial to the urban Northeast and the Middle West , the House of Representatives beat back today an amendment that would have scuttled a new formula meant to funnel increased urban development aid to the large older cities . The vote , which split 261 to 149 along regional lines , came as the House neared a final vote on the renewal of the Com- j community Development Block Grant program . The program , which would be ex- , panded to more than S4 billion a year under the bill , is the Federal Government 's chief measure to help cities to combat physical deterioration and decay . The amendment failed after spirited debate that brought to the surface many divisions in the chamber , which is closely attuned to the local concerns of its members  --  big cities , small suburbs , the Snowbelt and the Sunbelt . Different Version in Senate With the California-sponsored amend ' ment swept away , the House appeared almost certain to pass the bill , probably tomorrow . A slightly different version was reported out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that house is not expected for a couple of weeks . The block grant program provides millions of dollars to local officials all over the country for a variety of urban efforts such as street improvements , housing rehabilitation and community centers . It combines several previous programs , including Model Cities and urban renewal . The hill to renew it contains a pew dual formula for allocating the money that is expected to be particularly beneficial to the ailing cities of the Northeast and the Middle West . New York City , for example , would get $225 million in the next fiscal year . or $75 million more than this year . Similar benefits would ac- // crue to depressed areas in Connecticut and New Jersey . Jersey City 's share would rise to $10.7 million from $6.3 million by 1980 . The bill also provides for a new $400 million program requested by the Administration . called the Urban Development Action Grant program , to help to spur economic development in " several deI pressed " urban areas . This program was cut back sharply in the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Senate floor . But the issue in the House today was ' the new funding formula . It was becoming increasingly evident that the old formula  --  which depended on population , poverty and overcrowding  --  did not suffi , sufficiently aid the most depressed cities , , which were losing population . So an al ; ternative formula was devised  --  originally by the Ford Administration  --  using poverty , the extent of pre-1939 housing and lag in population growth . Cites would ! use whichever formula provided more money . Although the new system greatly benefits the older cities of the Northeast , which stood to lose millions of dollars in urban aid that they used to get , the Sunbelt cities generally do not get less than under the current program . However , they will generally get a proportionately smaller share of the enlarged funds . For this reason , Representatives Mark W. Hannaford and Jerry M. Patterson , both California Democrats , introduced the amendment to revert to the old single formula . Mr. Hannaford said that the new plan would cause " great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles gets $17 per capita in community development money and Detroit $20 ; under the new formula , Los Angeles would get $19 and Detroit $42 , a disparity he called " absolutely unacceptable . " Representative Thomas L. Ashley , the Ohio Democrat who is floor manager for the bill , countered by saying that a city could take advantage of either fomula , and that the second plan better addressed cities with much physical deterioration , such as Detroit . Representative Richard Kelly , a Florida Republican , said that the new formula added to the preference already given to the Northeast under the old law and asked why taxpayers in his part of the country should be required to give money to help to develop other areas with which they were in " commercial combat . " The issue was not really a regional one , argued Representative Stanley N. Lundine , a Democrat of upstate New York . He said that such cities as Denver . Louisville and Savannah would suffer if the amendment passed . " Not only large , but small cities all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander , an Arkansas Democrat , supported the amendment " reluctantly , " saying that the bill did not address adequately the deep poverty often found in small towns like those in his district . Other House members faulted the new formula on the ground that it relied heavily on the age of housing , rather than poverty . Supporters like Mr. Ashley said that this might not be perfect but argued that an aged housing stock usually correlated well with the type of physical deterioration addressed by the program , which is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development . It was left to a Westerner , Les AuCnin , an Oregon Democrat , to issue a plea for national unity in support of the Eastern cities . " We are talking about the physical human habitation of people , " he said . " This is the formula that best meets the real needs . " It may be imperfect , but failure to implement programs like this , he said , will lead to disaster . " The East will decay , the industrial cities will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the country , " he said . " My allegiance is to the West , but I also belong to the nation , and this is a national need , " he concluded .
