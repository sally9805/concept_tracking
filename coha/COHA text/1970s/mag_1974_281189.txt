The way the Maryland Bar Association saw it , Spiro Agnew 's uncontested conviction for tax evasion , along with the lengthy list of charges that were not going to be prosecuted , clearly added up to the sort of " moral turpitude " that required disbarment . Agnew himself admitted that he deserved to be temporarily suspended as a practicing lawyer . <P> But , argued his attorneys , disbarment was " going a little far , " - especially since the offense involved " nothing wrong insofar as his clients are concerned . " The three Maryland judges who heard the case are expected to announce their decision this week . <P> Whatever the outcome , the Agnew case-to say nothing of the long roster of Watergate-tainted lawyers-suggests that the legal profession has not been notably successful in preventing ethical lapses . Nor has it policed itself very vigorously . Said one disgusted delegate to the American Bar Association 's annual meeting last summer : " The time is upon us , gentlemen , to belly up to the buzz saw and do something about this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any such teeth . As recently as 1970 , an A.B.A. committee , chaired by retired Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark , examined the profession 's system of ethics enforcement and found " a scandalous situation . " It reported that " lawyers convicted of federal income tax violations are not disciplined , ... even after disbarment lawyers are reinstated as a matter of course , . . . lawyers will not appear or cooperate in proceedings against other lawyers ... and finally , state disciplinary agencies are undermanned and underfinanced . " <P> The Clark committee proposed various remedies-including automatic suspension while disbarment proceedings are pending against lawyers convicted of serious crimes , a requirement that permanent records of those proceedings be kept and that disciplinary actions be publicized . As a national organization , the A.B.A. does not actually disbar any lawyer ; state and local bars generally seek such action by state courts . But the A.B.A. has strong influence , and in the past three years many states have begun to heed the Clark suggestions . <P> Reform is coming to the bar with particular authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a program to weed out incompetents by having attorneys take periodic tests . State bar authorities are currently processing some 3,000 cases against lawyers ( among them , many involved in Watergate , including Richard Nixon ) . That is a small but typical increase over previous years . The A.B.A. began compiling rough national figures in 1965 and logged a grand total for the entire year of 216 disbarments , suspensions , reprimands and resignations under fire . By 1972 the tally was 357.
