txt To the Editor : I feel that a dangerous precedent is being set in the case of Police Officer Torsney ( news story Feb. 6 ) . Several years ago , the International Psychiatric Association condemned the Soviet Union for using psychiatric confinement as a punishment for crimes against the state . The psychiatrists were right in doing so , and they should be equally critical of the decision of the Appellate Division in the case of the white police officer acquitted in the killing of a black youth by reason of temporary insanity . The initial court decision was that Officer Torsney , being a victim of psychomotor equivalency epilepsy , was not responsible when he pulled the trigger . It was on the basis of this diagnosis alone , and not that of personality disorder , that he was committed to Creedmore Psychiatric Center . It was on the basis of this diagnosis alone that be was released from psychiatric treatment . Now the courts are questioning Creedmore 's decision to release Mr. Torsney . Perhaps they are questioning Man vs . Animals : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albertson 's Feb. 6 letter on hunting and the article which prompted it , I must say in all fairness that while hunting is gross , animal husbandry is far more inhumane . One would hope that in the wilds animals live together in herds or families . The young stay with their mothers until they are old enough to leave . The animals eat their natural diets and are free to roam . In contrast , animal husbandry separates the young from their parents prematurely in many cases  --  veal for example . The animals are strictly confined and must follow farm protocol . Unlike their free-roaming counterparts , farm animals are reduced to nothing more than factoried units . Pigs , clean-living by their nature , are forced to live in dirty pens , which mistakenly reinforce their reputation ; chickens , four to a cage ; cattle separated from their calves ; minks kept in cages . Is this humane ? Is it really worse to live your life free as a bird to one day be felled by a bullet ? Or is it better to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fed antibiotics and tranquilizers , periodically removed from one environment to another only to face certain death at the hands of a butcher ? PAUL OBIS Editor/Founder , Vegetarian Times New York , Feb. 6 , 1979 Keep the Trains Running To the Editor : Trains are not like buses . Once they stop running , they can not start up again the next day . A study of the history of transportation reveals that , should America abandon its national rail network , it may deeply regret the loss in the future . GREGORY BATTCOCK New York , Feb. 5 , 1979 what many have long perceived to be an insult to justice in his acquittal . The courts are looking to the mental health system to mete out the punishment they belatedly feel Mr. Torsney deserves , ignoring the fact that he has been treated for the condition initially diagnosed and found capable of returning to society , although happily not in his former capacity . It is an old proverb in the field of psychology that if you assemble 100 psychiatrists on a cold day , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . Now , the courts have found just such a person , who claims that Torsney also has a personality disorder , which was not in evidence at the time of the trial . We must not allow the courts to use the mental health system as a surrogate form of punishment for those they either can not or choose not to convict .

Why Joggers Jog To the Editor : Dr. Christiaan Barnard 's comment on jogging as a form of masochism , ( Notes on People , Feb. 6 ) shows that you should n't necessarily let a leading cardiac surgeon advise you on either masochism or jogging : ? While one indeed has to run a good distance to use up calories ( about 800 per hour ) , the fact is that most confirmed joggers are not overweight . ? No jogger with any sense runs on a street that is polluted by gas fumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does his jogging . ? Most joggers I know jog because they enjoy it and because it makes them feel good . They also hope that it may keep them out of Dr. Bamard 's waiting mom but realize that the last word on this is not yet in . A final note : Anyone who jogs around his lawn has yet to discover the pleasures of jogging . DAVID M. MACDONALD , M.D. Tenafly , N.J. , Feb. 6 , 1979 To the Editor : New Yorkers have by nature never been known to shy away from a fight . In that vein we welcome the economic challenge of Atlanta 's new apparel mart , just as our Yankees welcomed the challenges of Boston , Kansas City and Los Angeles . I take issue , however , with certain presumptions in Wayne King 's Feb. 6 news article . Specifically , he reports that " statistically , it would appear that the exodus of the apparel industry from New York ... is already well established , and the Atlanta effort ... merely takes advantage of an existing trend , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cited in the article are from 1971 ) simply do not corroborate this thesis . According to the New York State Department of Labor , employment in New York City 's apparel industry increased consistently each year from 1975 To the Editor : Again New York talks about overcrowded prisons , and again New York looks in the wrong place for answers . A Feb.1 article detailed how Governor Carey has approved a plan to take over Rikers Island and build two 512-bed prisons upstate at enormous cost to the taxpayer . Meanwhile , thousands of offenders who because of the petty nature of their crimes pose no danger to the community languish in // Jan Sawka prisons many miles from their homes . It would make more sense if we determined , as Minnesota has , how many of these non-dangerous offenders could be punished outside prison walls at far less cost . Then we could worry about building new prisons . The article also mentioned that Ossining prison , which the Governor says is to be phased out , is being renovated at a cost approaching $10 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I wonder if increasing prison populations , spurred by tougher laws that do nothing to ease street crime , will not again be used as an excuse to keep the antiquated prison 's financial burden on the shoulders of New York State residents . Lovs-rr S. GRAY Bronx , Feb. 1,1979 through 1978 . The overall 1975-78 gain is 5 percent . Individual segments of the industry have shown even greater growth . Fur employment , for instance , went up 20 percent in those years . And business in this field is so promising that the International Fur Fair will this year for the first time hold its annual meeting in New York City . One might also wonder why , if the apparel industry in New York City is indeed gasping its last , the city 's Department of Employment is studying a training program to help fill 5,000 potential jobs . If , as reported in the article , Atlanta 's emissaries have come to " pick the bones of New York , " they may find a very lively corpse .

New York 's Growing Apparel Industry Pope John Paul II : A Voice for Basic Christian Concepts To the Editor : In a Feb. 3 editorial on the Orlando Letelier assassination you again urged the quick extradition of three former high Chilean intelligence officials who were indicted in this country last year on still unproved and unsubstantiated charges of having ordered Mr. Letelier 's murder . The editorial ( like most stones The Times has published on the case ) implies strongly that these three former officials are guilty . They have not been proved guilty by a court of law in either the United States or in Chile and , according to the basic legal tenets of both nations , must be presumed innocent . However , they do stand accused by the American adventurer Michael Townley , who claims employment at various times during his career by both the C.I.A . and the Chilean DINA and proudly admits having planted the bomb that killed Mr. Letelier and his American aide , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return for " helping " the prosecution , Townley will serve no more than 90 months in prison . For such an extraordinarily lenient sentence , any observer would conclude , Townley would testify to anything to " help " the prosecution . It is interesting to note that the Chilean Government extradited Townley with no fuss and on the request of the United States Government . What would The Times 's editorial position be if a foreign nation demanded the extradition of former C.I.A . chiefs Richard Helms and /or James Schlesinger and /or William Colby and /or George Bush to answer testimony to be presented against these C.I.A . leaders which would be as valid as Townley 's against the Chilean intelligence officials ? We deplore the murder of Mr. Letelier and Mrs. Moffitt . We are certainly as anxious as The Times to see the perpetrators brought to justice rather than let off with less than 90 months . However , the Nuremberg approach suggested by The Times must be considered as empty and facile a gesture as Chile 's demanding the extradition of former C.I.A .

MARVIN LIEBMAN Secretary pro tern American-Chilean Council New York , Feb. 5 , 1979 To the Editor : In reference to your Jan. 30 editorial " A Voice Against ' Liberation Theology , ' " I for one did not find Pope John Paul II 's stand on priestly activity in politics " disappointing . " It seemed a reaffirmation of some basic Christian concepts . Nowhere in Jesus ' teaching does he urge his disciples to minister to human wants and needs of a material nature . Nor does he call for the reform of social and political structures . ( Surely the Roman Empire was oppressive ) . Rather he instructed his followers to bring the " Good News " of Christ to all the nations that they might reform their moral and spiritual lives , thus inheriting everlasting life . Surely there are enough people and institutions on this earth catering to the material and physical wants and needs of society . However , there are only a few ministering to the spiritual needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question of the usefulness of prayer : Prayer is the most powerful weapon a Christian possesses to overcome human problems , be it social injustice , hunger , poverty or any other trouble . In Jesus ' words , " Ask and you shall receive . " It should follow then that the Pope , as the head of the church started by Jesus Christ , should urge all priests not to get involved in social and political issues but rather to deal with the moral and spiritual needs of all mankind . As every Christian believes the soul and spirit are everlasting , this would seem a much worthier endeavor . This letter , written from the spiritual point of view , might not make any sense to a nonbeliever . However , as you chose to criticize the spiritual leader of Christ 's church from the human and physical point of view , I hope you will acknowledge this spiritual Christian rebuttal . JAMES NC BERKERY 3D East Quogue , L.I. , Feb. 2 , 1979 ? To the Editor : Contrary to your editorial and several reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " does not have to do with whether " Scripture justifies political action " or with whether priests " must confine themselves to the pulpit and altar . " " Liberation theology " is largely a Latin American phenomenon associated with the writings of men such as Gustavo Gutierrez and Juan Luis Segundo , and with the revolutionary activities ( praxis ) of priests , some of whom have taken up arms in guerrilla movements . It is conventionally based upon an explicitly Marxist analysis of class struggle which its proponents believe should be normative for the Christian church 's teaching and life . As Pope John Paul made clear in Mexico , the issue is not whether the church is for liberation . Clearly it is . The issue is how we define liberation . Since Constantine , the church has frequently attempted to establish through direct political action what it believed to be a just and Christian society , under auspices both right and left . When , last year , the first John Paul declined to be crowned with the papal tiara and the current Pope followed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the church has abandoned its pretensions to direct political rule . It will no longer give its uncritical blessing to Caesar or to those who would be the new Caesars . It would be a sad regression for the church that has broken its alliance with the Constantines and Francos of history now to resume its old habits in partnership with Marx . A church that points toward the Kingdom of God , and thus lives in critical tension with all existing or proposed political orders , can better advance democratic pluralism and more effectively advocate the cause of the poor ? who are ever oppressed by political saviors of both the left and the right . That , I believe , is the very progressive manifesto issued by John Paul this oast week . RICHARD JOHN NEUHAUS Senior Editor , Worldview New York , Jan. 30 , 1979 ? To the Editor : I wish you 'd make up your mind . When the Catholic Church speaks out against abortion ? which you and politicians have unaccountably removed from the moral order to the political order ? it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , when the Holy Father calls for an end to " liberation theology " and a return of priests to their religious vocation , you call that a disappointment . Thank God for Pope Paul 's direct handling of this most important prob . fem . At least he can see clearly that by allowing priests to get involved in political and social activities the church would be reduced to another arm of the state . Each is necessary , but each involves a totally different sphere of activity . The church seeks to provide for the spiritual welfare of man , the state for the temporal . When they work as they are supposed to , we have peace and harmony . ( Rev. ) THOMAS W.
