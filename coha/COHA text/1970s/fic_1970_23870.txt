a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer SOMETHING IS THERE A S A RULE , RABBI NECHEMIA from Bechev knew the cunning of the Evil One and how to subdue him , but the last few months he had been plagued by something new and terrifying : wrath against the Creator . A part of the Rabbi 's brain quarreled with the Lord of the Universe , rebelliously arguing ; yes , You are great , eternal , almighty , wise , even full of mercy . But with whom do You play hide-and-seek  --  with flies ? What help is Your greatness to the fly when it falls into the net of the spider that sucks out its life ? Of what avail are all Your attributes to the mouse when the cat clamps it in its claws ? Rewards in Paradise ? The beasts have no use for them . You , Father in Heaven , have the time to wait for the End of Days , but they ca n't wait . When You cause a fire in Feitl the water carrier 's but and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold winter 's night , that is an injustice beyond repair . The dimming of Your light , free choice , redemption , may serve to explain You , but Feitl the water carrier needs to rest after a day 's toil , not to LOSS about on a bed of rotten straw . The Rabbi knew well that Satan was talking to him . He tried every means to silence him . He submerged himself in the icy water of the ritual bath , fasted , and studied the Torah until his eyes closed from weariness . But the devil refused to be thwarted . His insolence grew . He screamed from morning till night . Lately , he had begun to defile the Rabbi 's dreams . The Rabbi dreamed of Jews being burned at the stake , of Yeshiva boys led to the gallows , of violated virgins , tortured infants . He was shown the cruelties of Chmelnitzki 's and Gonte 's soldiers and those of the savages who consume the limbs of animals before the beasts expire . Cossacks impaled children with their spears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long moustache and murderous eyes ripped open a woman 's belly and sewed a cat inside . In his dream , the Rabbi waved his fists toward Heaven and shouted , " Is all this fur Your glory , Heavenly Killer ? " The whole court at Bechev was on the verge of collapse . The old Rabbi , Reb Gabriel Zadduck , Rabbi Nechemia 's father , had died three years before . He had suffered from cancer of the stomach . Rabbi Nechemia 's mother had developed the same disease in her breast . Besides the Rabbi , one daughter and son remained . The Rabbi 's youngerbrother , Simcha David , became an " enlightened one " while his parents were alive . He left the court and his wife , the daughter of the Zhilkovka Rabbi , and went to Warsaw to study painting . The Rabbi 's sister , Hinde Shevach , had married the son of the Neustater Rabbi , Chaim Mattos , who immediately after the marriage sank into melancholia and returned to his parents , Hinde Shevach became an abandoned wife . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go through divorce procedures . Rabbi Nechemia 's own wife , a descendant of the Rabbi of Kotzk , had died together with her infant at childbirth . The matchmakers proposed various mates for the Rabbi , but he gave them all the same answer : " I will think it over . " Actually , no appropriate match was offered . Must of the Bechev Chasidim had deserted Reb Nechemia . In the Rabbinical courts , the same laws prevailed as among the fish in the sea : the big ones devoured the little ones . The first to leave were the rich . What could keep them in Bechev ? The study house was half ruined . The roof of the ritual bath had caved in . Weeds grew everywhere . Reb Nechemia was left with a single beadle  --  Reb Sander . The Rabbi 's house had many rooms , which were seldom cleaned , and a layer of dust covered everything . The wallpaper was peeling . Windowpanes were broken and not ' replaced . The entire building had settled in such a way that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered from rheumatism ; her joints became knotted . Reb Nechemia 's sister , Hinde Shevach , had no patience for housework . She sat on the couch all day long reading books . When the Rabbi lost a button from his coat , there was no one to sew it on . The Rabbi was barely twenty-seven years old , but he appeared older . His tall figure was stooped . He had a yellow beard , yellow eyebrows , yellow sidelocks . He was nearly bald . He had a high forehead , blue eyes , a narrow nose , a long neck with a protruding Adam 's apple . He had a consumptive pallor . In his study , Reb Nechemia , wearing a faded housecoat , a wrinkled skullcap , and shoddy slippers , paced back and forth . On the table lay a long pipe and a bag of tobacco . The Rabbi would light it , take one puff , and put it down . He would pick up a book , open it , and close it without reading . He even ate impatiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it while walking . He took a sip of his coffee and continued to pace . It was summer , between Pentecost and the Days of Awe , when no Chasidim go forth on pilgrimages , and during the long summer days the Rabbi had time enough to brood . All problems blended into one  --  why the suffering ? There was no answer to he found to this question , neither in the Pentateuch , in the books of the Prophets , in the Talmud , in the Zohar , nor in the Tree of Life . If the Lord is omnipotent , He could reveal Himself without the aid of the Evil Host . If He is not omnipotent , then He is not really God . The only solution to the riddle was that of the heretics : there is neither a judge nor a judgment . All creation is a , blind accident  --  an inkwell fell on a sheet of paper and the ink wrote a letter by itself , each word a lie , the sentences chaos . In that case , why does he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of a Rabbi is he ? To whom does he pray ? To whom does he corriplain ? On the other hand , how can spilled ink compose even a single line ? Arid from where does the ink and the sheet of paper come ? ! Vu , and from where does God come ? Rabbi Nechemia stood at the open window . Outside , there was a pale blue sky ; around a goldenyellow sun little clouds curled like the flax that is used to protect the Esrog in its case . On the naked branch of a desiccated tree stood a bird . A swallow ? A sparrow ? Its mother was also a bird , and so , too , its grandmother  --  generation after generation , thousands of years . If Aristotle was right that the universe always existed , then the chain of generations had C111 beginning . But how could that be ? The Rabbi grimaced as if in pain . He formed a fist . " You want to conceal Your face ? " He spoke to God . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal mine . Enough is enough . " Ile decided to put into action what he had contemplated for a long time . 2 . T HAT FRIDAY NIGHT the Rabbi slept little . He I. napped and awoke intetmittently . Each time he fell asleep , horrors seized him anew . Blood flowed . Corpses lay strewn in the gutters . Women ran through flames , with singed hair and charred breasts . Bells clanged . A stampede of beasts with rams ' horns , pigs ' snouts , with skins of hedgehogs and pussy udders emerged from burning forests . A cry rose from the earth  --  a lament of men , women , serpents , demons . In the confusion of his dream . the Rabbi imagined that Simchas Torah and Purim had fallen on the same day . Had the calendar been altered , the Rabbi wondered , or had the Evil One taken dominion ? At dawn an old man with a crooked beard , wearing a torn robe , ranted at him and shook his fists . The Rabbi tried to blow the ram 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound was a wheeze that might have come from a deflated lung . The Rabbi trembled and his bed shook . His pillow was wet and twisted , as if it had just been wrung out from the washtub . The Rabbi 's eyes were half glued together . " Abominations , ? the Rabbi muttered . " Scum of the brain . " For the first time since he could remember , the Rabbi did not perform the ablutions . " The power of Evil ? Let 's see what Evil can do ! The sacred can only stay mute . " He walked over to the window . The rising sun rolled among the clouds like a severed head . At a pile of garbage , the community he-goat was trying to chew last year 's palm leaves . " You are still alive ? " the Rabbi addressed him . And he remembered the ram whose horns were caught in the thicket that Abraham had sacrificed instead of Isaac . He always had a need of burnt offerings , the Rabbi thought of God . His creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do it . I will do it , " thc Rabbi said aloud . In Bechev they prayed late . On the summer Sabbaths there was barely a quorum , even counting the few old men who were supported by the court . The night before , the Rabbi had resolved not to put on his fringed garment . but he did so anyway out of habit . He had planned to go bareheaded , but reluctantly he placed the skullcap on his head . One sin at a time is enough , he decided . He sat down on his chair and dozed . After a while . he started and got up . Until yesterday the Good Spirit had attempted to reprimand the Rabbi and to threaten him with Gehenna or a demeaning transmigration of the soul . But now the voice from Mount Horeb was stifled . All fears had vanished . Only anger remained . " If He does not need the Jews , the Jews do n't need Him . " The Rabbi spoke no longer directly to the Almighty but to some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 82nd Psalm : " God standeth in the Congregation of the mighty ; He judgeth among the Gods . " Now the Rabbi agreed with every kind of heresy  --  with those who deny Him entirely and with those who believe in two dominions ; with the idolators who serve the stars and the constellations and those who uphold the Trinity ; with the Karaites , who renounced the Talmud ; with the Samaritans , who forsook Mount Sinai for Mount Gerizim . Yes , I have known the Lord and I intend to spite Him , the Rabbi said . Many matters suddenly became clear : the primeval snake , Cain , the Generation of the Flood , the Sodomites , Ishmael , Esau , Korah , and Jeroboam , the son of Nebat . To a silent torturer one does not speak , and to a persecutor one does not pray . The Rabbi hoped that somehow at the last moment a miracle would occur  --  God would reveal Himself or some power would restrain him . But nothing happened . He opened the drawer and took out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath . He filled it with tobacco . Before striking the match , the Rabbi hesitated . He admonished himself . " Nechemia , son of Gabriel Zaddock , this is one of the thirty-nine tasks prohibited on the Sabbath ! For this , one is stoned . " He looked around . No wings fluttered : no voice called . He withdrew a match and lit the pipe . His brain rattled in his skull like a kernel in thc nutshell . He was plummeting into the abyss . Usually the Rabbi enjoyed smoking , but now the smoke tasted acrid . It scratched his throat . Someone might knock at the door ! He poured a few drops of ablution water into the pipe  --  another major via . latinn , to extinguish a fire . He had a desire for further transgression , but what ? He wanted to spit on the Mezuzah but refrained . For a while , the Rabbi listened to the turmoil within him . Then he went out into the corridor and passed along to Hinde Shevach 's room . He pulled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is there ? " Hinde Shevach called out . " It is I. " The Rabbi heard her rustling , murmuring . Then she opened the door . She must just have awakened . She wore a house robe with arabesques , slippers , and on her shaven head a silk kerchief . Nechemia was tall , but ' Bride Shevach was small . Though she was barely twenty-five years old , she looked older , with dark circles under her eyes and the grieved expression of an abandoned wife . The Rabbi rarely came to her room , never so early and on the Sabbath . She asked , " Has something happened ? " The Rabbi 's eyes filled with laughter . " The Messiah has come . The moon fell down . " " What kind of talk is that ? " " Hinde Shevach , everything is finished , " the Rabbi said , astounded by his own words . " What do you anean ? " " I 'm not a Rabbi anymore . There is no more court unless you want to take over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shevach 's yellowish eyes measured him crookedly . " What happened ? " " I 've had my fill . " " What will become of the court , of me ? " " Sell everything , divorce your schlemiel , or leave for America . " Hinde Shevach stood still . " Sit down , you frighten me . " " I 'm tired of all these lies , " the Rabbi said . " The whole nonsense . I 'm not a rabbi and they 're not Chasidim . I 'm leaving for Warsaw . " " What will you do in Warsaw ? Do you want to follow in Simeha David 's path ? " " Yes , his path . " Hinde Shevach 's pale lips trembled . She looked for a handkerchief among her clothes on a chair . She held it to her mouth . " What about me ? " she asked . " You are still young . You 're not a cripple , " the Rabbi said , baffled by his own words . " The whole world is open to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to divorce me . " " He 's allowed , allowed . " The Rabbi wanted to say , " You can do without divorce , " but he was afraid that Hinde Shevach might faint . He felt a surge of defiance , the courage and the relief of one who has rid himself of all yokes . For the first time he grasped what it meant to be a nonbeliever . He said , " The Chasidic institution is sheer mendicancy . Nobody needs me . The whole business is a swindle and a falsehood. " 3 . IT ALL PASSED SMOOTHLY . Elude Shevach locked ' herself in her room , apparently crying . Sander the beadle got drunk after Havdalah , the ushering out of the Sabbath , and went to sleep . The old men sat in the study house . One recited the Valedictory Prayers , another read the Beginning of Wisdom , a third cleaned his pipe with a wire , a fourth patched a sacred book . A few candles flickered . The Rabbi gave a final look at the study house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed his satchel himself Since his wife 's death , he had grown accustomed to fetching his own linen from the chest where the maid placed it . He took out several shirts , some underwear , and long white stockings . He did n't even pack his prayer shawl and phylacteries . What for ? The Rabbi stole away from the village . How convenient that the moon was not shining . He did not take the highway but walked along the back roads with which he had been familiar as a boy . He did not wear his velvet hat . He had found a cap and a gaberdine from the days when he was a bachelor . Actually . the Rabbi was no longer the same man . He felt that he was possessed by a demon who thought and chattered in its own peculiar manner . Now he passed through fields and a forest . Even though it was Saturday night when the Evil Ones run rampant , the Rabbi felt bolder and stronger . He no longer feared dogs or robbers . He arrived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a train until dawn . He sat down en a bench , near a peasant who lay snoring . The Rabbi had recited neither the Evening Prayer nor the Shemah . I will shave off my beard . too , he decided . He was aware that his escape could not remain a secret and that his Chasidim might seek him out and find him . Briefly , he considered leaving Poland . He fell asleep and was awakened by the ringing of a bell . The train had arrived . Earlier , he had bought a fourth-class ticket because in those carriages there is never any illumination ; the passengers sit or stand in the dark . He was apprehensive of encountering citizens of Bechev , but the car was full of Gentiles . One of them struck a match , and the Rabbi saw peasants wearing four-cornered hats , brown caftans , linen trousers  --  most of them barefoot or with rags on their feet , There was no window in the car , only a round opening . When the sun rose , it cast a purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap tobacco , eatin coarse bread with lard , and washing it down wit vodka . Their wives reclined on the baggage an dozed . The Rabbi had heard about the pogroms I Russia . Bumpkins such as these killed men , rape women , plundered , and tortured children . Th Rabbi huddled in a corner . He tried to cover hi nose from the stench . " God , is this Your world ? he asked . " Did You attempt to give them the Tora : on Mount Sair and Mount Paran ? Is it among ther that You have dispersed Your chosen people ? " Th wheels clammered along the rails . Smoke from th locomotive seeped through the round hole . I reeked of coal . oil , and some indiscernible smol dering substance . " Can I become one of these ? " th Rabbi asked himself . " If God does n't exist , neithe did Jesus . " The Rabbi felt a strong urge to urinate but ther were no facilities . These passengers seemed to b flea- and lice-ridden . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having left Bechev . " Wh. prevented me from being an infidel there ? " It asked himself . " At least I had my own bed . An . what will I do in Warsaw ? I have been impetuous . I forgot that a heretic too needs food and a under his head . My few rubles will not last long Siincha David is a pauper himself . " The Rabbi ha . been informed that Simcha David was starving wore tattered clothes , and in addition was stubbor : and impractical . " Well , and what did he expect . There is no lack of charlatans in Warsaw . " The Rabbi 's legs ached and he lowered himself to the floor . He shoved the visor of his cap lowe on his forehead . Jews boarded the train at variou stations ; someone might recognize him . Sudden he heard familiar words . " Oh my God , ihe sou which Thou gayest me is pure : Thou didst ereat it , Thou didst form it , Thou didst breathe it int me : Thou preservest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me but wilt restore it unto me hurt after .... " " A lie , a brazen lie , " something in th Rabbi exclaimed . " All have the same spirit  --  a mar an animal . Ecclesiastes himself admitted this therefore the sages wanted to censor him . Well , bu what is a spirit ? Who formed the spirit ? What d the worldly books say about that ? " The Rabbi slept and dreamed that it was Yor Kippur . He stood in the Synagogue yard along wit : a group of Jews who wore white robes and praye shawls . Someone had locked the Synagogue , hr why ? The Rabbi lifted his eyes to the sky and it stead of one moon he saw two , three , five . Whi was that ? The moons seemed to rush toward on another . They became larger and more radian Lightning struck , thunder rolled , and the sk blazed in flames . The Jews emitted a howlin lament : " Woe , Evil is prevailing ! " Shaken , the Rabbi awoke . The train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warsaw since hi father  --  blessed be his memory  --  fell ill and wer there to see Doctor Frankel a few months befor his demise . Father and son had then traveled in special carriage . Sextons and court members ha accompanied them . A crowd of Chasidim had waited at the station . His father was led to the house of a rich follower on Twarda Street . In his living room Father interpreted the Torah . Now Nechemia walked along the platform carrying his own valise . Some of the passengers ran , others dragged their luggage . Porters shouted . A gendarme appeared with a sword on one side , a revolver on the other , his chest covered with medals , his square face red and fat . His tallowy eyes measured the Rabbi with suspicion , hatred , and with something that reminded the Rabbi of a predatory beast . The Rabbi entered the city . Trolley cars clanged their bells , droshkies converged , the coachmen flicked their whips , the horses galloped over the cobblestones . There was a stench of pitch , refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Rabbi asked himself . " Here the Messiah is supposed to come ? " He searched in his breast pocket for the scrap of paper bearing Simcha David 's address , but it had vanished " Are the demons playing with me already ? " The Rabbi returned his hand to the pocket and withdrew the paper he had been searching for . Yes , a demon was mocking him . But if there is no God , how can there be an Evil Host ? He stopped a passerby and asked for directions to Simcha David 's street . The man gave them . " What a distance ! " he said . Each time the Rabbi asked how to reach Smoteha Street , where Simcha David lived , he was advised to take a trolley car or a droshlcv , but the trolley seemed too formidable and a droshky was too expensive . Resides , the driver might be a Gentile . The Rabbi spoke no Polish . He stopped to rest every few minutes . He had n't eaten breakfast ; still , he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watered and he felt a dryness in his throat . The smell of freshly baked rolls , bagels , boiled milk , and smoked herring drifted from the courtyards . He passed by stores that sold leather . hardware , dry goods , and ready-made clothes . The salesmen vied for customers , tore at their sleeves , winking and interspersing their Polish with Yiddish . Saleswomen called out in a singsong , " Apples , pears , plums , potato kugel , hot peas and beans . " A wagon laden with kindling tried to pass through a narrow gate . A cart piled high with sacks of flour forced its way through another gate . A madman  --  barefoot , wearing a caftan with one sleeve missing and a torn cap  --  was being chased by a bevy of boys . They called taunts and threw pebbles at him . " Mother cooked a kitten . " a young boy sang out in a high-pitched voice . Blond sidelocks hung down from his octagonal cap . The Rabbi proceeded to cross the street and was nearly run down by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrung their hands and scolded him . A man with a dirty gray beard who carried a sack on his shoulders said , " You 'll have to recite a Thanksgiving benediction this Saturday . " " So , Thanksgiving . " The Rabbi spoke to himself . " And what does he carry in the sack  --  his portion in Paradise ? " He finally reached Smotcha Street . Someone pointed out the gate number to him , At the gate a girl was selling onion rolls . He entered a courtyard where children were playing tag around a huge , freshly tarred garbage receptacle . Nearby , a dyer dipped a red skirt in a kettle filled with black dye . In an open window a girl was airing a featherbed , beating it with a stick . The first people he asked knew nothing of Simcha David . Then one woman said , " lie must live in the attic . " The Rabbi was unaccustomed to so many steps . He had to stop to catch his breath . Refuse littered the stairway . Apartment doors stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One flat contained a line of weaving looms where girls with bits of cotton in their hair deftly knotted threads , On the higher stories holes gaped in the plastered walls and the smell became stifling . Suddenly the Rabbi saw Simcha David . He had emerged from a dark corridor , sapless , in a short jacket spattered with paint and clay . He had yellow hair and yellow eyebrows . He carried a bundle . The Rabbi was amazed that he recognized his brother , he looked so much like a Gentile . " Simcha David ! " he called . Simcha David stared . " A familiar face , but ? " " Take a good look . " Simcha David shrugged . " Who are you ? " " Your brother , Nechemia . " Simcha David did n't even blink . His pale blue eyes looked dull , sad , ready for all the bizarre things time might bring . Two deep wrinkles had formed at the corners of his mouth . He was no longer the prodigy of Bechev but a shabby laborer . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . What 's wrong ? " " I 've chosen to follow you . " " Well , I ca n't stop now . I have to meet someone . They 're waiting for me . I 'm late already . I 'll let you into my room so you can rest . We 'll talk later . " " So be it . " " ' I had not thought to see thy face , ' " Simcha David quoted from Genesis . " Nu , I thought you had already forgotten everything , " the Rabbi said . He was more embarrassed by his brother 's quoting the Bible than by his coolness . Simcha David opened the door of a room so tiny it reminded the Rabbi of a cage . The ceiling hung crookedly . Along the walls leaned canvases , frames , rolls of paper . It smelled of paint and turpentine . There was no bed , only a dilapidated couch . Simcha David asked , " What do you want to do in Warsaw ? These are hard times . " He left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he in such a rush , the Rabbi wondered . He sat on the couch and looked around . Nearly all the paintings were of females  --  some nude , some half-nude . On a little table lay brushes and a palette . This must be the way he makes a living , the Rabbi thought . It was clear to him now that he had acted in folly . He should n't have come here . One can suffer pain anywhere . The Rabbi waited for an hour , two , but Simeha David did n't return . Hunger gnawed at him . " Today is a day of fast for me  --  a heretic 's fast , " he told himself . A voice inside him teased , " You deserve what you 're getting . " " I do n't repent , " the Rabbi retorted . He was ready to wrangle with the Angel of God as he once struggled with the Lord of Evil . The Rabbi picked up a book from the floor . It was in Yiddish. lie read a story about a saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered kindling for a widow . What is this  --  morality or mockery ? The Rabbi had expected to read a denial of God and the Messiah . He picked up a pamphlet whose pages were falling out , and read about colonists in Palestine . Young Jews plowed , sowed , dried swamps , planted eucalyptus trees , fought the Bedouins . One of these pioneers had perished and the writer called him a martyr . The Rabbi eat bewildered . If there 's no creator , why go to the Holy Land ? And what do they mean by a martyr ? The Rabbi grew tired and lay down . " Such Jewisbness is not for me , " he said . " I 'd rather convert ! " But where did one convert ? Besides , to convert one had to pretend belief in the Nazarene . It seemed that the world was full of faith . H you did n't believe in one God , you must believe in another . The Cossacks sacrificed themselves for the Tzar . Those who wanted to dethrone the Tzar sacrificed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretics , those who believed in nothing ? He had not come to Warsaw to barter one faith for another . 4 . HE RABBI WAITED FOR THREE HOURS , but Simeha I David did n't come back . This is how the modern ones are , he brooded . Their promise is not a promise ; they have no sense of kinship or friendship . Actually what they worship is the ego . These thoughts perturbed him  --  was n't he one of them now ? But how does one curb the brain from thinking ? He gazed about the room . What could thieves find of value here ? The naked females ? He went out the door , closed it , and walked down the stairs . He took his valise with him . He was dizzy and walked unsteadily . On the street he passed a restaurant but was ashamed to enter . He did n't even know how to order a meal . Did all the patrons sit at the same table ? Did men eat together with women ? People might ridicule his appearance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David lived and bought two rolls . But where could he eat them ? He remembered the proverb . " One who eats in the street resembles a dog . " He stood in the gateway and bit into the roll . He had already committed sins that were punishable by death . but eating without washing his hands and without reciting a benediction disturbed him . He found it difficult to swallow . Well , it 's a matter of habit , the Rabbi comforted himself . One must get accustomed even to being a transgressor . He ate one roll and put the other into his pocket . He walked aimlessly . On one street three funeral processions drove past him . The first hearse was fol lowed by several men . A few droshkies rode aftt the second . No one accompanied the third . " Wel it does n't make any difference to them , " the Rabt said to himself . " Tor the dead know not anythint neither have they anymore a reward , ' " he quote Ecclesiastes . He turned right and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside by gas lamps although was midday . From wagons nearly as large as imam men were unloading rolls of woolens , alpaca , co tons , and prints . A porter walked along with basket on his shoulders , his back bent under th load . High-school boys in uniforms with Ode buttons and insignias on their caps toted boot strapped to their shoulders . The Rabbi stopped . you did n't believe in God , why raise children , wh support wives ? According to logic , a nonbelievs should care only for his own body and for no or else . He walked on . In the next block a bookstore di played books in Hebrew and Yiddish : The Genera tions and Their Interpreters , T he Mysteries of Pori The Little Man , Masturbation , How to Prevei Consumption . One book was titled How the Un verse Came into Being . I 'm going to buy it , Rabbi decided . There were a few customers insid The bookseller , a man with gold-rimmed glass ? attached to a ribbon , was talking to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide brim and cape on his shoulders . The Rabbi stopped at tl shelves and browsed among the hooks . A salesgirl approached him and asked , " WIn do you want  --  a prayer book , a benedictor ? " The Rabbi blushed . " I noticed a book in tl window but I 've already forgotten its name . " " Come out , show it to me , " the girl said , winkle at the man with the gold-rimmed glasses . Sl smiled and dimples formed in her cheeks . The Rabbi had an impulse to run away . E pointed out the book . " Masturbation ? " the girl asked . " Vichna Dvosha Goes to America ? " " No , the one in the middle . " " How the Universe Came into Being ? Let 's back inside . " The girl whispered to the store owne who now stood behind the counter . He scratcht his forehead . " It 's the last copy . " " Shall I take it from the window ? " the girl aske . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the store owner said . " It 's out of date .

" " For what did you come to Warsaw ? To be merchandise for your store ? " " Yes , merchandise . " " What kind of merchandise ? " The Rabbi wanted to answer that it was no bus ness of his but it was n't in his nature to be insoler He said , " I want to know what the heretics are sa ing . " The girl laughed again . The merchant took off his glasses . The man in the cape stared at him with his big black eyes . " That 's all you need ? " " I want to know . " " Well , he wants to know . Will they allow you to read it ? If they catch you with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study house . " " No one will know , " the Rabbi replied . He realized he was speaking like a child , not like an adult . " Well , I guess the Enlightenment is still alive , the same as fifty years ago , " the man in the cape said to the owner . " This is the way they used to come to Vilna and ask , ' How was the world created ? Why does the sun shine ? Which came first , the chicken or the egg ? ' ' He turned to the Rabbi . " We do n't know , my dear man , we do n't know . We have to live without faith and without knowledge . " " So why are you Jews ? " the Rabbi asked . " We have to be Jews . An entire people can not become assimilated . Besides , the Gentiles do n't want us . There are several hundred converts in Warsaw and the Polish press attacks them constantly . And what would conversion accomplish ? We have to remain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " the Rabbi asked . " Who knows . It 's out of print . Anyway , it only states that the universe evolved .

I have one copy and I do n't want to stir the dust , " the owner said . " Come back in a few weeks when we redo the window . The tini ? verse wo n't turn sour in that short a time . " " Please forgive me . " " My dear fellow , there are no unbelievers anymore , " said the man in the cape .

" The Rabbi remained silent . He felt as timid as a cheder boy . He said , " Thank you . " and left . 5 . HE RABBI CONTINUED TO WALK the streets . Dusk . i. was falling , and he remembered that it was time for the Evening Prayer , but he was in no mood to flatter the Almighty , to call Him a bestower of knowledge , a reviver of the dead , a healer of the sick , a freer of the imprisoned , or to implore Him to return His holy presence to Zion and to rebuild Jerusalem . The Rabbi passed a jail . A black gate was opened and a man bound in chains was led in . A cripple without legs moved about on a board with wheels . A blind man sang a song about a sunken ship . On a narrow street , the Rabbi heard an uproar . Someone had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his throat . A woman moaned , " He refused to be robbed , so they attacked with their knives . May Hell 's fire consume them . God waits long but punishes well . " Why does He wait so long ? the Rabbi wanted to ask . And whom does he punish ? The stricken , not the strikers . Police arrived , and the siren of an ambulance wailed . Young men in torn pants , the vizors of their caps covering their eyes , rushed out from the gates , and girls with their hair disheveled , worn-out slippers on their bare feet . The Rabbi was afraid of the mob and its noise . He entered a courtyard . A girl with a shawl over her shoulders , her cheeks as red as though painted with beets , said to the Rabbi , " Come in , it 's twenty groschen . " " Where shall I go ? " the Rabbi asked uncomprehendingly . " Come right downstairs . " " Pm looking for a place where I can lodge . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Rabbi started . For the first time since he had grown up , a strange woman was touching him . The girl led him down dark steps . They walked through a corridor so narrow that only one person could pass at a time . The girl walked ahead , dragging the Rabbi by his sleeve . A subterranean dampness hit his nostrils . What was this  --  a living grave , the gate to Gehenna ? Someone was playing on a harmonica . A woman was ranting . A cat or a rat jumped over his feet . A door opened and the Rabbi saw a room without a window , lit by a small kerosene lamp , its chimney black with soot . Near a bare bed that had only a straw mattress stood a wash basin of pink water . The Rabbi 's feet stuck to the threshold like those of an ox being led into the slaughterhouse . " What 's this ? Where are you taking me ? " " Do n't play dumb . Let 's have fun . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty groschen . " Could this he a house of ill repute ? The Rabbi trembled and withdrew a handful of change from his pocket . " Take it yourself . " The girl picked up a ten-groschen coin , a sixgroschen coin , and a four-groschen coin . After some hesitation she added a kopek . She pointed to the bed . The Rabbi dropped the remaining coins and ran back through the corridor . The floor was uneven and full of holes . He nearly fell . He humped into the brick wall . " God in Heaven , save me ! " His shirt was drenched . When he reached the courtyard it was already night . The place stank of garbage , gutter , and rot . Now the Rabbi deplored that he had invoked the name of God . His mouth filled with bile . A tremor ran through his spine . These are the pleasures of the world ? Is this what Satan has to sell ? He took out his handkerchief and wiped his face . Where do I go now ? " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes , and above the walls hovered the sky with a new moon and a few stars . He gazed bewilderedly , as if viewing it for the first time . Twenty-four hours had not even passed since he had left Bechev , but it seemed to him that he had been wandering for weeks , months , years . ? The girl from the cellar stepped out again . " Why did you run away , you silly yokel ? " " Please , forgive me , " the Rabbi said and he walked out into the street . The crowd was gone . Smoke rose from chimneys . Storekeepers were locking their stores with iron bars and locks . What bad happened to the young man who was stabbed , the Rabbi wondered . Had the earth swallowed him ? Suddenly he realized that he was still carrying his valise . How was this possible ? It seemed as though his hand clutched it with a power of its own . Perhaps this was the same power that created the world ? Maybe this power was God ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not even good at sinning  --  a bungler in every way . Well , its my end , my end . In that ease there 's only one way out , to give back the six hundred and thirty limbs and sinews . But how ? Hanging ? Drowning ? Was the Vistula nearby ? The Rabbi stopped a passerby . " Excuse me , how do you get to the Vistula ? " The man had a sooty face , like a chimney sweep . From under his bushy coal-black eyebrows he stared at the Rabbi , " For what do you need the Vistula ? Do you want to fish ? " his voice barked like a dog 's . " Fish , no . " " What else , swim to Danzig ? " A jester , the Rabbi thought . " I was told there is an inn in the neighborhood . " " An inn near the Vistula ? Where do you come from , the provinces ? What are you doing here , looking for a teaching job ? " " Teaching ? Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warsaw cobblestones you need strength . Do you have any money ? " " A few rubles . " " For one gulden a night you can sleep in my place . I live right here in number fourteen . I have no wife . I will give you her bed . " " Well , so be it . I thank you . " " Have you eaten ? " " Yes , in the morning . " " In the morning , huh ? Come with me to the tavern . We 'll have a glass of beer . A snack , too . I 'm the coal dealer from across the street . " The man pointed with a black finger to a store whose doors were barred . He said , " Be careful , they may steal your money . A man from the provinces has just been taken to the hospital in an ambulance . They stabbed him with a knife . " 6. rilfiE COAL DEALER WALKED UP the few steps to the I tavern . The Rabbi stumbled along after him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the odor of beer , vodka , garlic , by the sounds of men 's and women 's loud voices and of dance music . His eyes blurred . " Why do you stop ? " the coal handler asked . " Let 's go . " He took the Rabbi 's arm and dragged him . Through vapor as dense as in the bathhouse of Berkley , the Rabbi saw distorted faces , racks o bottles on the wall , a beer barrel with a brass pump a counter on which sat platters of roasted geese plates of appetizers . Fiddles screeched , a drun pounded ; everyone seemed to be yelling . " Ha something happened ? " the Rabbi asked . The coal dealer led him to a table and screamec into his ear , " This is not your little village . This i Warsaw . Here you have to know your way around . ' " I 'm not used to such noise . " " You 'll get used to it What kind of teacher d ( you want to be ? There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher . What ' the good of all the studying ? They forget anyhow I went to cheder myself . They taught me Rashi all that . I still remember a few words : ' And th . Lord said unto Moses .. " " A few words of the Torah arc also Torah , " th . Rabbi said , aware that he had no right to spcal after having violated so many commandments . " What ? None of ifs worth a cock 's crow . Thes boys sit in the study house . shaking and makint crazy faces . When they 're about to be drafted , the rupture themselves . They marry and ca n't suppor their wives . They breed dozens of children wh , crawl about barefoot and naked . " Perhaps he is the real unbeliever , the Rabb thought . He asked . " Do you believe in God ? " The coal dealer placed a fist on the table . " Ho do I know ? I was never in Heaven . Something i there . Who made the world ? On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Love of Friends It costs a few rubles , but how does the saying go-let it be a mitzvah . We pray with a Rabbi wh hardy has a piece of bread . His wife comes to m to buy ten pounds of coal . What are ten pounds o coal in the winter ? I add a piece just for goo measure . If there is a God , then why does fie alloy the Poles to beat up the Jews ? " " I do n't know . I wish I did . " " What does the Torah say ? You seem to knos the fine points . " " The Torah says that the wicked are punishe and the righteous rewarded . " " When ? Where ? " " In the next world . " " In the grave ? " " In Paradise . " " Where is Paradise ? " A waiter approached . " For me light beer an chicken livers , " the coal dealer ordered . " What d you want ? " The Rabbi was at a loss for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands here ? " The coal dealer snorted . " Here you cat withal washing , but it 's kosher . They wo n't serve yo pork . " " Perhaps I will have a. cookie , " the Rabbi mu tered . " A cookie ? What else ? Here you have to was everything down . What kind of beer do you want Light ? Dark ? " " Let it be light . " " Well , give him a mug of oat beer and an eg cookie . " After the waiter left , the coal dealer began to drum the table with his sooty nails . " If you have n't eaten since morning , that is n't enough . Here , if you do n't eat you 'll drop like a fly . In Warsaw you have to be a glutton . H you want to wash your hands for the benediction , go into the toilet . There 's a faucet there , but you 'll have to wipe your hands on your coat . " " Why am I so unhappy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am sunk in iniquity just like the rest of them  --  even worse . If I do n't want to be Jacob , I have to be Esau . " To the coal dealer , he said , " I durl'i w ant to he a teacher . " " What do you want to be , a count ? " " I would like to learn some trade . " " What trade ? If you want to be a tailor or a shoemaker or a furrier , you have to begin young . They take you as an apprentice and the master 's wife tells you to pour out the slops and to rock the baby in the cradle . I know . I learned to be a carpenter and my master never let me touch the saw or the plane . I suffered with him for four years and when I left I had learned nothing . Before I knew it , I had to go serve the Tzar . For three years I ate the soldier 's black bread . In the barracks you have to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . Did I have a choice ? When I was discharged , I went to work for a coal dealer and this has been my trade since . Everybody steals . They bring you a wagon of coals that should weigh one hundred puds but it weighs only ninety . Ten puds are stolen along the way . If you ask too many questions , they knife you . So what can I do ? I pour water on the coal and that makes it heavier . If I did n't do it I would go hungry . Do you understand me ? " " Yes , I understand . " " So why chatter about a trade ? You most probably warmed the bench in the study house all these years , did n't you ? " " Yes , I studied . " " So you 're good for nothing except to be a teacher . But you have to be fit for that also . There 's a Talmud Torah on the block where they had a softy of a teacher . The boys who study there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he ran away . As for the rich , they want a modern teacher who wears a tie and knows how to write Russian . Do you have a wife ? " " No . " " Divorced ? " " A widower . " " Shake hands . I had a good wife . She was a little deaf but did her job . She prepared my meals , we had five children , but three died when they w ere babies . 1 have a son in Yekaterinslay . My daughter works in a hardware store . She boards with her employers . She does n't want to cook for her daddy . Her boss is a rich man . Anyhow , I 'm alone . How long have you been a widower ? " " A few years . " " What do you do when you need a female ? " The Rabbi blushed and then became pale . " What can one do ? " " For money everything can be had in Warsaw . Not here on this street . Here they 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little worm in her blood . You get sick and you begin to rot . There 's a man in the neighborhood whose whole nose has rotted off . On the better streets the whores have to be inspected every month at the doctor 's . It costs you a ruble to be with one of them , but at least they 're clean . The matchmakers are after me but I ca n't make up my mind . All the women want is your rubles . I was sitting with one right here in the tavern and she asked me , ' How much money do you have ? ' She was an old hag and ugly as sin . I said to her that how much money I had saved up was none of her business . If for one ruble I can get a girl who is young and pretty , why do I need such an old bag ? Do you follow me ? Here 's our beer . What 's the matter ? You 're as pale as death . " 7. rillIFIEE WEEKS HAD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warsaw . He slept at the coal dealer 's . The coal dealer had taken him to the Yiddish theater after the Sabbath meal . He had also taken the Rabbi a di him to the races at Vilanov . Every day except Saturday the Rabbi visited Bresler 's Library . He stood at the bookshelves and browsed . Then there was a table where one could sit and read . The Rabbi came in the morning and stayed until closing time . In the afternoon he went out and bought a roll . a bagel , or a piece of potato kugel from a market woman . He ate without a hene ? diction . He read hooks in Hebrew , in Yiddish . He even tried to read German . In the library he found the book that he had first seen in the shop window . How the Universe Came into Being . " Yes , how was it created without a creator ? " the Rabbi asked himself . He had developed the habit of talking to him . self . He tugged at his beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study house . He muttered , " Yes , a fog , but who made the fog ? How did it arise ? When did it begin ? " The earth was torn away from the sun , he read but who formed the sun ? Man descended from an ape  --  but where did the ape come from ? And since the author was n't present when all this happened , how could he be so sure ? Their science explainer everything away in distance of time and space . The first cell appeared hundreds of millions of years ago , in the slime at the edge of the ocean . The sun will be extinguished billions of years hence . Millions of stars , planets , comets , move in a space with no beginning and no end , without a plan or purpose . In the future all people w ill be alike , there will be a Kingdom of Freedom without competition , crises , wars , jealousy , or hatred . As the Talmud says , anyone who wants to lie will tell of things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrew magazine , Haasif , the Rabbi read about Spinoza , Kant , Leibniz , Schopenhauer . They called God substance , monad , hypothesis , blind will , nature . The Rabbi clutched at one of his sidelocks . Who is this nature ? Where did it get so much skill and power ? It took care of the most distant star , of a rock in the bottom of the ocean , of the slightest speck of dust , of the food in a fly 's stomach . In him , Rabbi Nechemia of Bechev , nature did everything at once . It gave him abdominal cramps , it stuffed his nose , it made his skull tingle , it gnawed at his brain like the gnat that plagued Titus . The Rabbi blasphemed God and apologized to Him . One moment he wished death upon himself and the next he feared sickness . He-needed to urinate , went to the toilet but could n't function . As he read , he saw green and golden spots before his eyes and the lines merged , diverged , bent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind ? Is it the end ? Have the demons already got hold of me ? No , Father of the Universe , I will not recite my confession . I 'm ready for all Your Gehennas . If You can be silent for an eternity , I at least will remain dumb until I give up my soul . You are not the only man of war , " the Rabbi spoke to the Almighty . " If I am Your son , I too can put up a fight . " The Rabbi stopped reading in an orderly fash ? ion . He would take out a hook , open it at the middle , run through a few lines , and replace it on the shelf . No matter where he opened , he encountered a lie . All books had one thing in common : they avoided the essential , spoke vaguely , and gave different names to the same object . They knew neither how grass grew nor what light was , how heredity worked , the stomach digested , the brain thought , how weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though these scholars wrote thick books about the distant galaxies , they had n't yet discovered what went on a mile beneath the crust of the earth . The Rabbi turned pages and gaped . He would lay his forehead on the edge of the table and nap for an instant . " Woe to me . I have no more strength . " Every night , the coal dealer tried to persuade the Rabbi to return to his own village . He would say , " You will collapse and they wo n't even know what to write on your headstone . " t ATE ONE NTGHT when Hinde Shevach slept , she was awakened by steps in the corridor . Who creeps around in the middle of the night , Hinde Shevach wondered . Since her brother had left , it was as silent in the house as in a ruin . Hinde Shevach got up , put on a housecoat and slippers , She opened a crack in the door and noticed a light in her brother 's room . She walked over and saw the Rabbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his skullcap was crumpled . The expres- sion on his face was entirely altered . He was bent like an old man . In the middle of the room stood a satchel . Hinde Shevach wrung her hands . " Are my eyes deceiving me ? " " No . " " Father in Heaven , they 're searching for you all over . May the thoughts that I had be scattered over the wastelands . They 're already writing about yot in the newspapers . " " So , well . " " Where were you ? Why did you leave ? Why di ( you hide ? " The Rabbi did n't reply . " Why did n't you say you were leaving ? " Hind , Shevach asked despondently . The Rabbi dropped his head and did n't answer " We thought you were dead , God forbid . I tele graphed Simcha David but no answer Game . wanted to sit the seven days of mourning for you Heaven save me ! The whole town is in an uproar They invented the most gruesome things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to asl me for your description and all the rest of it . " " Too bad . " " Did you see Simcha David ? " Hinde Shevacl asked after a hesitation . " Yes . No . " " How is he making out ? " " Eh . " Hinde Shevach gulped . " You 're as white a chalk , all in tatters . They dreamed up such storie that I was ashamed to show my face . Letters am telegrams came . " Well ... " " You ca n't just get rid of me like this . " Hind . Shevach changed her tone . " Speak clearly . Why di ( you do it ? You 're not just a street urchin , t'ou'r. the Rabbi of Bechey . " " No more Rabbi . " " God have mercy . There will be bedlam . Wail I 'll bring you a glass of milk . " Hinde Shevach withdrew . The Rabbi heard he go down the steps . He seized his beard and swayed A huge shadow wavered along the wall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i no milk . " " I wo n't go until you tell me why you left , ' Hinde Shevach said . " I wanted to know what the heretics say . " " What do they say ? " " There are no heretics . " " Is that so ? " " The whole world worships idols , " the Rabb muttered . " They invent Gods and they serve them " The Jews also ? " " Everybody . " " Well , you 've lost your mind . " Hinde Shevac ! remained standing for a while and stared , then sh walked back to her bedroom . The Rabbi lay down on his bed fully clotheC He felt his strength leaving him  --  hot ebbing awa but all at once and rapidly . A light he never knee was there flickered in his brain . His hands and fee grew numb . His head lay heavy on the pillow . Afte a time , the Rabbi lifted an eyelid . The candle ha , burned out . A pre-dawn moon , jagged and dimme by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , th sky reddened . " Something is there , " the Rabl murmured . The war between the Rabbi of Beebe and God had come to an end .
