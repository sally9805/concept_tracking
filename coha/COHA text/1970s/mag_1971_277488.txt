UP THE SANDBOX by Anne Richardson Roiphe. 155 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $4.95 . <P> <P> Walter Mitty is alive and well in the appealing shape of a young matron on Manhattan 's Upper West Side . She is Margaret Reynolds , the decidedly sane housewife-heroine of Up the Sandbox , a fresh , beguiling , bittersweet novel that looks into those three old hats : men , marriage , motherhood . <P> Margaret stands somewhere to the right of Women 's Lib but to the left of total fulfillment through old-fashioned marriage . She loves her husband Paul , a college professor who is a scholar of social disorder . She is inordinately proud of the body that brings her pleasure and has borne her two children . But her sharpest perceptions affirm her worst fears : " My life hardly differs from that of an Indian squaw settled in a tepee on the same Manhattan land centuries ago . Pick , clean , prepare , throw out , dig a hole , bury the waste-she was my sister . She would understand why there should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> How does the lady cope ? By alternating between reality and dreams of glory that Mitty would be proud to claim . Her hours watching her offspring in the playground are brief respites from harrowing trips to Viet Nam and nights interviewing Fidel Castro as America 's star female reporter . By day she extols the virtues of the grocery list as pop art . By night she is an intern working miracles in a ghetto hospital . She is a loving spectator of the sandbox-and-sprinkler set but her mind 's eye is on PROWL , a black revolutionary group where she is mistress to the leader . Playground palaver is easy to ignore when at dusk in the arms of your lover you will play a pivotal role in a plot to blow up the George Washington Bridge . <P> There are certain psychic risks , of course , to a life led beneath the surface of domestic bliss . In the darkest Amazon , when a poison arrow proves nearly fatal , Margaret finds herself praying , " Paul , my darling , if I make it home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make chocolate mousse . " Here the most committed housewife asleep in her phoenix dreams will recognize that she and Margaret are soul mates . Few crises can not be better met if the house is filled with the aroma of freshly baked bread . In the end , Margaret affirms the reality of her existence in another pregnancy-man 's eternal solution to fear of mortality . The reader rejoices that unto them a child will be born-and unto Margaret , a whole new set of ego building fantasies . <P> Following on the heels of Digging Out , a critically acclaimed but entirely conventional first novel , Author Roiphe this time has happily been willing to experiment , a rare enough quality in second novelists . Skillfully-and without too much cloy-she captures the minutiae of matrimony and maternity , evoking only too clearly the " educated " woman 's dilemma , torn between vulnerability for her children and her demands for self . The Reynoldses make a city scene familiar in particular to New Yorkers . But Margaret 's inner scene will be recognized and applauded by young mothers everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identity crisis and yet not past the age of uncertainty . " If the authors insights are at times more precious than rare , her message is not . It is meant for those who dig men and the other two Ms and ask only to be out of the doll 's house part of the day .
