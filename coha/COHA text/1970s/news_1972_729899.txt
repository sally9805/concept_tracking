So far we have not found that any of these people charged were on our registry . But we will keep searching . We never stop searching . " " Followers Are Satisfied " Later , Muhammad enlarged on the statement by explaining " we do n't consider a person is a Muslim who is running around the country trying to start trouble . " He also said the Chicago-based sect has not been able to determine if the dissident group has a single leader .

When asked if any single individual would control the corporation , Muhammad responded with a chuckle that " since I 'm not going to come back and look over the staff , I 'd just as soon forget about that question . " He said that any violence within the sect had not created any fears for his own life because " there is no possibility of anyone taking my life . It is possible that they are threatening my life but my security is God himself . " For that reason , Muhammad said , there have been no changes in Muslim plans for " Savior 's Day " to be held Feb. 26 in the South Side Armory , 52d Street and Cottage Grove Avenue .
