Doodler as Artist <P> To the Editors : <P> Critic Harold Rosenberg is absolutely right : " No artist is more relevant than Steinberg " April 17 . To avoid boredom , he has doodled his way into the realm of the art world as a " serious " artist . <P> Claude Zic , Chicago <P> Saul Steinberg is surely the best cartoonist since Picasso . Picasso was an artist who degenerated into a cartoonist . Steinberg is a cartoonist who has metamorphosed into an artist . The difference between them is intellectual honesty . Viva Steinberg ! <P> Andreas Karl Reiser Cosmopolis , Wash . <P> Fabulous ! I love pictures that take time and creativity to make . So , Mr. Steinberg , keep on painting ! <P> Joe Natalicchio Milltown , N.J. <P> How can TIME cater to artistic platitudes like the work of this " fantastic " Steinberg ? Somewhere along the line , artists apparently decided that beauty and expressiveness in a work are old hat , and by masquerading behind secure parodies they can get away with a minimum of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crazy . But does that mean our art and culture should repress creativity and optimism and thereby give in to absurdity ? Steinberg has proved to me that he and the other moderns are bored . <P> Phil Gimson Glen Ridge , N.J. <P> Wrong Target <P> Your story on the neutron bomb April 17 is yet another example of unfair attacks on Carter . The first four paragraphs leave the impression that he ca n't make a decision . Only after attacking Carter do you give the facts : military and political leaders differ sharply over the bomb , and none of the key NATO countries will commit themselves to allowing it in their territory . Carter has made the only possible choice . He is not wasting $4 billion producing a useless weapon , and he is not precluding future production should the situation change . <P> Samuel C. Colbeck Norwich , Vt . <P> The neutron bomb supporters ' argument that its destructive potential would be a deterrent to war is as absurd today as it was 111 years ago , when Nobel invented dynamite . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't need another one . <P> Patrick Hagerty Chicago <P> About Carter 's B-1 bomber and neutron bomb decisions : all the Russians have to do is be patient ; in a few years we will be a defenseless , unionized , inflationary , welfare state . <P> Roger Haymore Mount Airy , N.C. <P> Not Taxing , But Spending <P> Hugh Sidey 's article on American taxation April 17 omits one major cause for potential tax revolt . Nobody objects to taxation per se . What we are increasingly angry about is the idiotic ways our hard-earned money is spent . <P> Federal fiscal thinking seems to center on placating special interests-the ecologists , those with kids in private schools , the elderly , the handicapped , the unemployed , the military , foreign governments , ad infinitum , without the least thought of what the total bill will be . <P> Stephen Engel-Phillips Syracuse , N. Y. <P> Sidey says of Beardsley Ruml that " in tax matters , too , he took the path of least resistance . " This is a singularly inept description of Ruml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new tax idea from an initially hostile Congress and Administration . Ruml was a resounding response to the oft-heard question , " What can one man do ? " <P> Treadwell Ruml Kansas City , Mo .
