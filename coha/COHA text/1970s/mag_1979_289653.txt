All that glitters is fair game <P> When it comes to investigative reporting , most French newspapers and magazines waddle along in step with their favorite political party , or shy away whenever the government frowns . A dazzling and from the government 's standpoint most damnable exception is the weekly paper Le Canard Enchan-literally , The Chained Duck-which pursues scandal with all the gusto of a Gallic gourmet tucking into a baba au rhum . These days the Chained Duck is flapping its wings triumphantly , and no wonder : dangling from its bill is the meticulously aloof French President , Valery Giscard d'Estaing . <P> In its last two issues , Le Canard charged that Giscard , both when he was Finance Minister and after he became President in 1974 , had graciously accepted 50 carats in diamonds-the first 30 alone valued at $240,000-from Jean-Bedel Bokassa , the sadistic former " Emperor " of the Central African Republic . <P> Bokassa reportedly also gave state gifts to Giscard 's brother , two of the President 's cousins , a top adviser and a pair of Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dubbed the affair " Giscarat . " <P> Founded in 1915 " to kill with ridicule those who profess the virtue of war , " the left-leaning Canard ( circ. 550,000 ) has skewered generations of French leaders with needle wit and wicked cartoons . <P> It was closed down during World War II , but before and after , during the hapless Third and the revolving-door Fourth Republic , stirred its editors to punishing glee . Le Canard also thrives on serious controversy . Says Chief Editor Roger Fressoz ( pen name : Andre Ribaud ) : " We began doing more investigative reporting with the Algerian War , when French citizens began to ask for more information . " <P> Its greatest subject was Charles de Gaulle . <P> Along with his saturnine sideman , Georges Pompidou , " le grand Charletan " provided the Duck with a target as big as the Ritz . He was caricatured endlessly and uproariously as an arrogant , sleepy-eyed , bulbous-nosed autocrat . <P> This decade Le Canard has been more enterprising . It revealed that the Gaullist resistance hero Jacques Chaban-Delmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years , virtually killing his bid for the presidency in 1974 . The Duck also unearthed some questionable financial dealings by the murdered Prince Jean de Broglie , a man with close ties to the Giscard administration , and printed the income tax dossiers of both Giscard and Aviation Tycoon Marcel Dassault . The government paid Le Canard a bumbling tribute one night when its agents were discovered in the paper 's offices trying to implant bugging devices . " Watergaffe , " quacked the Duck , and proudly proclaimed itself " the most listened-to newspaper in France . " <P> Investigative reporting in France is sharply restricted . Television stations are state-owned , and the national news service , Agence France Presse , is headed by a political ally of Giscard . Newspapers are vulnerable too , some because they have received government-guaranteed loans , others because they need the advertising directed their way by the state-controlled publicity conglomerate , Havas . <P>
