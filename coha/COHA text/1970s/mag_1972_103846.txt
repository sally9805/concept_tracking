Ever hear of Vitas Gerulaitis ? If not , you will  --  and so will Forest Hills and Wimbledon . A fortnight ago nobody in Australia had ever heard of Vitas Gerulaitis either , but now his name is a household word in Melbourne and Sydney , not to mention the little market town of Shepparton , 113 miles north of Melbourne . Of course , Vitas Gerulaitis is not the easiest of household words . Rhyme Vitas with meetus , Gerulaitis with arthritis , pronounce the G as in gamesmanship and you 'll be close . // In any event , everybody in Shepparton , the peach , pear and apple capital of Australia , knows how to say it now . In three days Vitas wrought more havoc in Shepparton than the fruit fly . How can a 17-year-old Long Island , N.Y . schoolboy devastate an Australian town 10,000 miles away from his Howard Beach home ? Well , in order to wreck Shepparton , Vitas first had to get there . To publicize the inauguration of its direct service from New York to Melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis players  --  17 boys and nine girls , all 14 to 18  --  to Australia to compete in the 48th annual Shepparton Lawn Tennis Club Easter weekend tournament and in exhibitions in Melbourne and Sydney . World Tennis magazine picked the players , the best in their sections . And the Shepparton club conspired in its own downfall . Originally the notion had been that the invading Americans would compete only in junior events , but the hospitable Aussies entered them in everything  --  the men 's open championship and the men 's A singles , to mention the top two categories . Vitas won them both . // Gerulaitis ' triumphs were only the top of an Antarctic iceberg of U.S. conquests , and there was even a measure of consolation for the Victorians . The architect of the disaster , they reminded each other , was an Australian  --  Harry Hopman , the taskmaster of Australia 's 20-year Davis Cup dynasty . The groundwork for this extraordinary defection was laid some years ago when Hopman 's cup teams began to slip and his differences with the Lawn Tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis ( he was against it ) . " All our great players will go where the money is , " Hopman warned then , and two years ago Harry went , too . // Now the proprietor of a flourishing tennis academy in Port Washington , N.Y. , Hopman was an obvious , though inspired , choice to " chaperon " the young Americans . The Australian press insisted on referring to him as " coach " of the American team , but in fact he met most of the players for the first time when the group gathered in New York . On the other hand , from that moment on there was no doubt that he was in charge . The juniors regarded him with affectionate awe and called him " Sir Hoppy , " though not to his face . ( Australians believe Hopman would have relished a knighthood to crown his Davis Cup successes and suspect the Queen 's preference for jockeys contributed to his departure from the Commonwealth. ) // At 65 and a merry new bridegroom , Hopman arrived in Melbourne brash as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Australia by coaching Americans ? " he was asked at Tullamarine Airport . " Tennis is an international game , " he answered . " I 've always looked at it that way and the fact that I 'm not in Australia does n't worry me a bit . " Of his American charges , he said : " I think these kids will be too strong for our juniors . " Too right , Harry . // In three days ' time , with only a soft word here and a gentle hint there , Hop-man had shaped these tennis-obsessed kids into a striking force somberly purposeful as Vince Lombardi 's Green Bay legions . Shepparton lay before them , ripe as one of the district 's giant peaches and stuffed with players from all over Victoria attracted by the chance to test themselves against the Yanks . // On Saturday morning , in sunshine blazing out of a pale blue bowl of cloudless sky , the carnage began . In the early rounds the Americans were matched against Australians  --  men , women and children  --  and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enormous entry list the club had prescribed the eight-game " pro " set in many divisions ) . From the outset it was clear that Vitas had cast himself as the star of the show . He is a husky six-footer , his head crowned by a Marxist ( Harpo ) aureole of curly blond hair that reaches below his collar , his eyes peering around a jib of a nose , his mouth as expressive as a 12-string guitar . " I sy , " said one Australian onlooker , " he looks a bit like your comedian Danny Ky . " Indeed he does , and when points are in dispute  --  as they were in nearly every match Vitas played  --  he looks like Danny Kaye playing King Lear . // In his first match in the men 's bracket Gerulaitis breezed through a capable 39-year-old Aussie named John McInnes , after shaking up McInnes in the second set by challenging line calls and the score on one game . In his second he destroyed Stephen Myer , the No. 4 Victorian junior , by disputing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the finals ) . // " Silly idiot , " said Harry Hopman . " He 's got to learn to behave . " Tall order . Gerulaitis is the only tour player Hopman has worked with for the past year , and Sir Hoppy  --  forever remembered for his iron discipline over Davis Cup teams  --  has yet to inhibit him in any way . While Vitas was commanding the attention of the crowd , the other juniors were methodically working their way through a dismaying number of brackets . By Sunday night Howard Schoenfeld of Beverly Hills , the smallest American , had won the boys under-15 championship , and of the 11 divisions in which they were entered U.S. juniors were in the finals , semifinals or quarterfinals of every one . In the course of play , Billy Martin , a slight , 15-year-old from Palos Verdes Estates in California , had disposed of Max Pettman , who last November won the men 's championship at Kooyong in Melbourne . // The real proof of Hopman 's leadership came on Monday , a day that dawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A number of the U.S. juniors , 20 of whom had never before performed on dry grass , let alone wet , demurred , but after a low-key pep talk from Hopman , each of them  --  given a clear choice between being a hero or a rat-fink  --  chose hero . As the spectators hunched in the slight cover of the clubhouse porch , the Americans straggled out under streaming skies . It was in this dank setting that Gerulaitis had his finest hour . Down 3-6 against Billy Martin , who was playing with surgical precision despite the rain , Vitas stopped everything with an anguished protest of Martin 's " let " call on a service that might have been an ace . This demonstration ended with Vitas jumping the net , pushing Billy ( but not very hard ) and then stalking off the court , again demanding an umpire . // The umpire was provided , but by then his presence was academic . Martin , whose emotions are as internalized as Vitas ' are externalized , let his rage destroy his game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6-2 . Meanwhile , in what may have been the best match of the tournament , Freddy De Jesus , the 17-year-old Puerto Rican who is the latest product of Welby Van Horn 's justifiably famous Caribe Hilton tennis school , upset Herb FitzGibbon , who seven years ago was on the U.S. Davis Cup squad . FitzGibbon was something of a ringer , having also come to Australia as another chaperon . // It was a famous victory , but it was too much for Freddy , who already had played two matches in the rain . An hour later against Vitas he simply gave out . At one point , after a desperate and unsuccessful dash for a soft little chop , De Jesus slid all the way under the net . Vitas , one eye on the wet and bedraggled gallery , promptly began counting him out . Freddy got up at seven , but played groggily thereafter . Vitas was the new champion of the Goulburn Valley . // The nine girls from the U.S. did not lose a match until they began playing each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both students of Chris Evert 's father , Jim  --  were in the finals or semifinals of no less than five events . By nightfall Monday two things were clear : 1 ) Thanks to the rain and Shepparton 's overambitious scheduling , the tournament could not be finished ; 2 ) It did n't matter much , because the finalists or semifinalists in the top events were all Americans anyway . A quick decision was made : the U.S. juniors and their entourage would return to Melbourne and , hopefully , would complete the matches at the famed Kooyong courts , where Hopman once prepared his lethal Davis Cup forces . // The first day at Kooyong the American boys once again shattered the Victorian juniors , winning 18 singles and losing only two , while the girls were even less polite  --  they won seven singles and three doubles and lost none . Next day on to Sydney , where the 48th annual Shepparton Lawn Tennis Tournament reconvened at world-famed White City . // Playing on center court , Vitas once again humbled Martin , 8-3 , to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me laugh , " Billy cried in anguish as one of Gerulaitis ' cross-court placements shot by 15 feet away . // Few people doubted that lithe , dark Laurie Fleming would beat lithe , blonde Sue Stap , her teammate , for the women 's championship , and those few people were right . Sue , whose forehand is reminiscent of Maureen Connolly 's , trimmed Laurie 8-6. // Pleasure was written all over Harry Hopman throughout the visit . The press not only allowed him to reiterate his jabs at the LTAA , but the performance of the American juniors and the nonperformance of the Australians seemed to vindicate his stand that the open game would destroy Australia 's tennis future . Where are the Lavers and Hoads and Rosewalls and Sedgmans and Frasers and Emersons and Roses of the next decade ? Maybe in the Outback . After the U.S. girls ' successive sweeps at Shepparton , Kooyong and White City , one irreverent American , thinking of Evonne Goolagong , muttered : " Better send for the abos. " // Hopman had one last blow in store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alex Aitchison , the longtime manager of Kooyong and the secretary of the Victorian LTA , to manage his Port Washington Tennis Academy . At White City , Harry asked an American Airlines official : " How long do we stop in Fee-jee ? " We will be in Fee-jee about an hour , " he was told . " Fee-jee , is that how you say it ? " Harry asked . " Yes , " said his companion . " But you are right  --  I know Fee-jee is the Australian pronunciation . " Harry grinned . " No , I must be the one to change , " he said . " I live in Port Washington now . "
