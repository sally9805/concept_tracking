<P> Richard Helms , currently our Ambassador to Iran , was around Washington last week , a shadowy figure in the corridors of power . The former head of the Central Intelligence Agency was once again defending himself and the agency against charges of overstepping authority . Helms , now 61 , moved about in the best traditions of his earlier trade , seeing few people , saying nothing , offering only a fleeting glimpse of his thin frame to newsmen . <P> In 32 years of Government service , it has been his lot to contend secretly with the real enemies of the U.S. , knowing that at any time he might be destroyed by suspicions and accusations that he could not fully answer , ones perhaps made by the very people he sought to protect . <P> Nobody who has been that long in the spy business can be a saint . Helms knows his list of errors and misjudgments better than anybody else . At the same time , many of his successes and triumphs are not known and never will be . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of pointless but relentless assault on privacy , still do not add up . Helms ' life has been dedicated in one way or another to opposing the abuse of power , outside and inside the U.S. Maybe some place , some time , something went wrong . If so , it is not on the record yet . <P> Helms sat at Lyndon Johnson 's Tuesday-luncheon table , where the big decisions were made , and one of the handful of regulars there has said that it was Helms who kept them all honest . When L.B.J. would begin to perceive the world as he wanted it to be and not as it was , Helms would often speak up and say : " Just a minute , Mr. President , that is not what we have found . " <P> <P> It was in 1967 at that same luncheon table that Johnson began to order the CIA to pay more attention to the Viet Nam War protest groups and their foreign contacts . Johnson was convinced that the Communists were pouring money into the antiwar movement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was not so , that the CIA could not find the connection . One day Johnson waggled his big finger at the men around him and complained : " I just do n't understand why you ca n't find out about all that foreign money that is behind those war protesters . " <P> There was the time Helms and L.B.J. had a shouting match outside the Oval Office . Johnson had made up his mind how a certain situation had come about . Helms told him it was not so . Helms would not yield , and though Johnson walked away from that encounter sore , he developed new respect for Helms . <P> Nixon came to the White House with a deep distaste for the CIA . He blamed the agency in part for his presidential defeat in 1960 . The CIA , Nixon told his close aides , had aided John Kennedy 's candidacy with phony figures about the missile gap between the U.S. and the Soviet Union .                  @ @ @
