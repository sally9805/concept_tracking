WEST GERMANY 'S Rollei-Werke for years has been losing sales to Japanese rivals , whose low wage costs enable them to sell cameras for less than half the price of a Rolleiflex . Fighting to overcome that handicap , Rollei executives recently decided to try to beat the Japanese at their own game . The German firm is investing $12.6 million in a new plant in Singapore . There workers will turn out cameras for sale in the U.S. and East Asia at wage rates only one-sixth as high as in Germany , and two-thirds below those prevailing even in Japanese camera plants . <P> How long Rollei 's advantage will last is problematic . Low as they are by European standards , Japanese wages more than doubled between 1963 and 1969 . Logically enough , Japanese industrialists are also discovering the advantages of shifting some production to lands where no wage explosion has yet begun . Within the past four years , at least 40 Japanese firms have set up plants in Taiwan alone . The factories turn out lingerie , computer parts , kitchenware and TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their owners would have to pay in Japan . <P> Willing Workshops . Both Rollei and the Japanese firms seem likely to have increasing company in their new locations . All over the industrialized world , accelerating wage inflation is pushing manufacturers into new efforts to tap the vast pool of willing and cheap labor in poorer countries . They are farming out production of component parts , subassemblies and even finished products , sometimes for export to other areas but often for use back home . In the process they are not only cutting their own costs but speeding the industrialization of underdeveloped countries , some of which are coming to relish the role of workshops for distant , richer lands . <P> U.S. companies started the trend for in obvious reason : since they pay the world 's highest wages , they have the most to save by manufacturing offshore . They began by subcontracting work to locally owned firms in Japan and Western Europe , and are still expanding that practice . Ford Motor , for example , has signed up Tokyo Shibaura Electric to make most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is dickering to have another Japanese firm , Dieel Kiki , supply many of the compressors needed in auto air-conditioning systems . Lately a growing number of American firms have gone further to set up their own component-manufacturing operations in the lower-wage Asian nations , Signetics Corp. , a Corning Glass Works subsidiary , for instance , flies components to Seoul , South Korea , where workers assemble them into integrated circuits that are flown back to the U.S. to be fitted into computers . The operation makes economic sense because Signetics pays the Korean workers only $45 a month v. the $350 or so it would have to pay an employee in Sunnyvale , Calif . Fairchild Camera and Instrument conducts a similar assembly operation for integrated circuits in Singapore .
