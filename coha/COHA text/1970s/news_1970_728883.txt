txt Widespread uncertainty exists here over the impact of the election victory of . Dr. Salvador Allende Gossens , yet to be confirmed by Congress . Mr. Allende , an avowed Marxist who helped found Chile 's Socialist Party 37 years ago , is sure to bring to the presidency a broad program of economic and social reform based on nationalization of much of Chile 's industry , banking , and commercial activity . But there is significant doubt that he will be able to bring about a complete socialization of Chile . His election victory Sept. 4 was so narrow that many observers here question how fast he can move toward the goals of Chile 's Marxist forces . At best he received only slightly more than one-third of the votes cast . Still , for many Chileans , the election spells the end of the system under which they have lived many years . In fact , on Sept. 7 , the first business day after the election , there was widespread speculation in the Chilean Escudo , and many banks had a run on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in 15 years . Airlines reported many new reservations from Chileans planning on leaving now that Mr. Allende has been elected . Mr. Allende , for his part , has already said on at least two occasions since the election that he will act within Chile 's Constitution and will honor " present obligations " ? presumably international . // *Chileans wait  --  coalition gains ? // This sort of statement simply does not satisfy the conservative forces here , but it is in keeping with the traditional approach of Chile 's political parties including both the Socialist and Communist Parties which make up the bulk of Mr. Allende 's backing . Both parties recognize the relative strength of opposition forces in Chile  --  almost two-thirds of the electorate voted for either Jorge Alessandri Rodriguez , candidate of the traditional conservative parties , or Radomiro Tomic Romero , standard-bearer for the Christian Democratic Party of incumbent President Eduardo Frei Montalva . Christian Democrats split To be sure , the Christian Democratic program is left of center , and there are elements within the party that favor the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the Christian Democrats , although divided in some degree between the center-left forces around President Frei and the more leftist elements around Mr. Tomie , want to maintain their own identity as a party . And most leading Christian Democrats see this as possible only through establishing a considerably different approach to solving Chile 's economic and social problems than that advanced by Mr. Allende . The fact that the Christian Democrats are still the largest single party in the country , despite Mr. TomiC 's third place among the three candidates , is a factor with which Mr. Allende must grapple . Mr. Allende , whose Socialist Party has numerous divisions , is also conscious of the need to go slow in advancing his program at this moment when his victory still has to be approved by Congress meeting in joint session Oct. 24 . Close race tallied The Congress will vote between the top two candidates , Mr. Allende and Mr. Alessandri , who ran so close in the contest that only one percentage point separates their vote count . Mr. Allende polled 36.2 percent , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the registered electorate stayed away from the polls , something in the neighborhood of 550 , - 000 persons . " That abstention can be taken two ways , of course , " a Christian Democratic spokesman said , " but it suggests significant disaffection with politics and politicians in general , and Mr. Allende knows this . " Thus the general view here is that Mr. Allende 's election win does not necessarily suggest that Chile will quickly go the Marxist road that Mr. Allende has signaled . He faces big opposition , and the conservative forces , the " mummies " as the Allende people call them , are not going to take an Allende victory sitting down . They still wield considerable power . They are more representative of traditional Chilean attitudes than either the Marxist elements around Mr. Allende or the newer re- form-minded Christian Democrats around President Frei and Mr. Tomic . And tradition continues to count for much here . " My victory is evidence of Chile 's traditional political liberties , " Mr. Allende said after learning of his narrow electoral win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people in 1976 ( when the next elections would normally be held ) , then some other party will assume the presidency . " Allende opponents note , however , that Mr. Allende has promised to seek a major constitutional revision which they fear will eliminate elections , and that even if this did not come to pass , the opposition would be much reduced in power through Allende programs and would prove ineffective in campaigning against a Marxist government . Nationalization of banking would , for example , eliminate one form of economic power held by the conservative forces . Although Mr. Frei 's Christian Democratic government sought curbs on banking practices , he never proposed banking nationalization . Another area into which Mr. Allende has talked of moving is the media business . His special target has ? been El Mercurio , an important morning newspaper in Santiago with a chain of smaller newspapers and radio stations around the country . It tends to represent the conservative interests of Chile .                 @ @ @ @
