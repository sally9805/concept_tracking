Oh , the Rock Island Line is a <P> mighty good road , <P> If you want to ride it , got to ride it <P> like you find it , <P> Buy your ticket at the station on the <P> Rock Island Line . <P> Popularized in a folk song made famous by Leadbelly , the once mighty Chicago , Rock Island &; Pacific has sold fewer tickets in recent years . In 1974 it lost $23 million , largely as the result of higher payrolls and a 200% increase in fuel costs . It has tried to merge with the prosperous Union Pacific and has borrowed from its own employees . With much justice , it has lambasted the U.S. <P> <P> Railway Association ( a federal agency set up to restructure rail service in the Midwest and Northeast ) for " intentional neglect " of its financial woes . <P> Last week , three days after the USRA had snubbed its plea for a $30 million emergency loan , the debt-ridden Rock Island Line became the first major railroad outside the Northeast since World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rescue operations began almost immediately . To avoid stranding 13,000 commuters , Chicago 's Regional Transportation Authority promised to take over service in and out of the city . Meanwhile , the Interstate Commerce Commission summoned representatives from 60 railroads to Washington and indicated that it will dismember the 7,500-mile road . The ice will parcel out some segments to other Western lines , and abandon the remainder of the Rock Island . <P> Worst Loss . As a result , several roads operating between Chicago , the Rockies and Texas clearly stand to gain from the bankruptcy . But there will be losers , too , including hundreds of grain shippers and manufacturers who have been served exclusively by the Rock Island . <P> The wreck of the Rock Island is just the latest sign of growing trouble on the U.S. rails and the failure of the Government to produce a rational rail policy for the nation . An ICC staff estimate predicts that the industry 's first-quarter loss will be " worse than has ever before occurred , even during the Great Depression of the 1930s . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Department of Transportation 's new Secretary , William Coleman Jr. , cautions : " It would be foolish simply to subsidize the rails . I think 20% of the nation 's rail trackage ought to be abandoned . "
