Better , but still bad . That was the economic picture last week as moderating temperatures eased energy shortages and allowed most factories in the frozen East and Midwest to resume at least partial operation . Perhaps a third of the 1.8 million employees who had been idled by cold-related shutdowns went back to their jobs . But some workers , such as the more than 3,000 watermen who harvest oysters in Maryland 's still iced-over Chesapeake Bay , may have to wait longer to resume earning money , and industries in the Pacific Northwest , confronting a drought that is undermining hydroelectric generating capacity , face power cuts of up to 25% . <P> The nation 's gas companies , helped by cutbacks in industrial use , managed for the most part to avoid serious disruption of residential service . Utilities reported gratifying householder response to appeals from President Carter to dial down thermostats . In Chicago 's North Shore residential area , consumption fell by as much as 15% . Nonetheless , hard-pressed utilities shopped far afield for additional supplies . A representative of Columbia Gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , prowled corporate corridors in Houston cornering utility men and offering to swap heating oil for Texas natural gas . A consortium of New York State power companies arranged for an extra 50 million cu . ft. of gas from Canada and another 50 million cu . ft. from California . <P> Now that a thaw is in sight , economists can begin to measure the impact of the unforeseen cold on the economic recovery . The verdict of TIME 'S Board of Economists : a sharp , but strictly temporary , setback . <P> Forecaster Otto Eckstein reckons the damage-in higher imports of oil , gas and food , higher prices for domestically produced fuel , fruits and vegetables , and lost wages-at about $6 billion . Meaning : consumers ' ability to buy things other than food and fuel will be reduced by that much . The figure , though lower than some other experts are calculating , is scarcely minor : it equals more than half of the $11.4 billion that President Carter proposes to pass out in tax rebates this spring . <P> But many board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quickly made up as plants go on overtime to catch up on lost output . Several likened the impact of the cold to the effect of a prolonged strike in a basic industry ; by the fourth quarter , they believe , the economy will be about where it would have been if this winter had been normal . So far as jobs and production are concerned , that is ; the inflationary impact will be longer-lasting . IBM Vice President David Grove now expects a 6.4% rise in consumer prices this year , v. the 5.8% he had forecast before the cold struck . <P> Some job losses due to natural-gas shortages , warn experts , will continue through the spring because some communities have burned in February natural gas designated for April delivery . Diversion of refinery runs from jet fuel to heating oil threatened disruptions in airline flight schedules .
