FRENCH CONNECTION II <P> Directed by JOHN FRANKENHEIMER Screenplay by ALEXANDER JACOBS and ROBERT and LAURIE DILLON <P> There was some unfinished business at the end of The French Connection . In fact , the unfinished business seemed just the point : that the French dope dealer so passionately pursued by the American cops could slip smoothly away through a massive stakeout and leave the country . The Frenchman was the source connection responsible for bringing in vast quantities of heroin from Marseille to New York . Frog One , Popeye Doyle called him , and the fact that he could get away nearly unruffled , meant simply that the law could never catch up with the main man . <P> It made a good object lesson but a slightly unsatisfying ending . French Connection II gives Popeye Doyle another shot , a real fighting chance at his nemesis . Allowing for the arguable proposition that any sequel was necessary , French Connection His one that is tough , shrewd and fast . The movie is exciting , even frightening , but never loses its strong naturalistic grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Frankenheimer has done since Seconds in 1966 . <P> <P> Gene Hackman is back behind the badge as Popeye Doyle . Comparisons with his initial appearance as Doyle are inevitable , especially since Hackman won the Oscar for that part the first time around . Here he is even better because the role has been extended and made a little more difficult . In French Connection II , Doyle is shipped over to Marseille complete with ankle gun and porkpie hat , a regular good-will ambassador from New York 's finest . " I 'd rather be a lamp post in New York than the President of France , " he snarls at his Gallic counterpart ( Bernard Fresson ) , who is supposed to cooperate with Doyle 's mis sion : to run Frog One to ground . <P> The French cops know something Doyle does not . They are aware that he has been set up , that the French and American police forces are using him as a decoy to flush out Charnier ( Fer nando Rey ) , the connection .

The middle portion of the movie shows Doyle trying to go cold turkey , and it is here that Hackman does some of his finest work . Many actors have tried to get under a junk ie 's skin , but when Hack man weighs in , the subject might as well never have come up before . He gets it all : the desperation , the gargoyle fantasies , the sickness and the terror . <P> The movie is a fairly brutal character study up until the time Popeye finally , albeit tenuously , shakes off his habit . Then , as Doyle goes out for revenge , Frankenheimer changes gear smoothly into the sort of supercharged action adventure that gives memories of the original French Connection some stiff competition .
