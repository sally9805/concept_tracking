Amid a riot of banners , 10,000 students took time out from examinations last week and began marching toward Mexico City 's giant Monument of the Revolution . They were protesting , among other things , the continued imprisonment of 40 students arrested during the October 1968 antigovernment demonstrations in the capital , during which more than 50 people died . The protesters had managed to proceed less than half a mile , however , when a skirmish line of police blocked their advance and fired off volleys of tear gas . Suddenly , as if on signal , waves of men carrying bamboo poles and clubs swooped out of gray-painted buses waiting on a nearby street , shouting " Halcones ! Halcones ! - Falcons ! Falcons ! " It was the first real show of force by the Falcons , an organization of antistudent , antileftist goons , mostly in their 20s . Their bloodcurdling war cry is likely to echo throughout Mexico for some time to come . <P> Military Fashion . The Falcons began beating demonstrators . Moments later a second wave appeared , armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random .

" They were well trained in the Japanese art of fighting with bamboo staves and equipped with a radio communications system . " <P> The students fled in every direction . Homeowners opened their doors to rescue them . Construction workers tossed down rocks and pieces of wood for the students to defend themselves with . Within minutes , nine students were dead from gunfire , and more than 200 other people were injured . <P> Then the Falcons invaded the Ruben Leero Hospital near by , where many of the wounded had been taken . They took captive all those who could walk and carried them off to Falcon headquarters , where it is feared more may have been murdered . Through it all , the police made no move to intervene . Who are the Falcons ? Spokesmen for President Luis Echeverra Alvarez put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But many Mexicans suspect that the city government is involved . Mayor Alfonso Martnez Domnguez , a former head of the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institutional , denounced the students and denied that the city has the Falcons on the payroll . At week 's end , the students issued a statement calling for the mayor 's removal .
