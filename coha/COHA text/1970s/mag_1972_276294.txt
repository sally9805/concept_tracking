As chairman of Zenith Radio Corp. , Joseph Wright has long been his industry 's Jeremiah , warning congressional committees and many other audiences that U.S. electronics companies could not meet Japanese competition . Other domestic television manufacturers began to buy components from Japan or move their plants to the Far East . Wright , too , shifted most of Zenith 's black-and-white set production from Chicago to Taiwan , and in mid-1971 he sadly announced that he would transfer color-set production as well . But he saw a much brighter picture as soon as the U.S. devalued the dollar , pressured Japan into revaluing its yen and took a sterner stand against Japanese dumping . <P> Encouraged , Wright decided to stay in the U.S. To reduce costs , Wright trimmed Zenith 's payroll in the past year by nearly 8% . He also got much help from John Nevin , an innovative cost cutter who left a Ford Motor vice-presidency to become Zenith 's president last May . Together , Wright and Nevin sold off marginally profitable lines in order to concentrate on consumer electronics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributor of electronic watches made by Switzerland 's Movado , a firm that Zenith already controls . <P> Most important , Zenith lowered its unit profit margin on color-TV sets , enabling it to cut the retail prices of color sets by $30 ; now a medium-sized set costs about $300 .

Last month Wright announced that first-quarter sales had risen 22% and net profits had jumped 28% , to $10 million .
