THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE 'VE just received a message from a friend  --  a very young woman , born into a world of air transportation . She writes : Half past ten at night on the first of January , 1977 , at the Amtrak train station in Cleveland , waiting to catch the eleven-five to New York . But the eleven-five will be at least an hour late , so I join the rest of the roomful of travellers in cursing the people who run the trains . At twelve o'clock , the train actually arrives , and everyone tries to get on first and so possibly install herself or himself in a window seat . I manage to get a window seat , but my overhead light does n't work and I am not able to read . For the first ten minutes that I am in my seat , the seat beside me remains vacant . I throw my coat in it , so that it will look as if the occupant just went for a stroll into another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping to look so unpleasant no one will say to me , " Is anybody sitting here ? " This way , if I feel like it later on , I can curl up and sleep comfortably . My little ruse does n't work : a young woman comes along and asks , " Is anybody sitting here ? " She sits down , and I look out the window . It has been snowing for days , so there is much snow on the ground , and it is white and beautiful and the night is clear and beautiful . I look at the woman seated next to me . She has open on her lap a large textbook , and I can see that it has something to do with natural childbirth and progressive child care . The woman turns to me and asks me my destination . When I tell her , she says , " That 's where I am going , too , " and then " Do you know that it took them three hours to get from Toledo to Cleveland ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Toledo to Cleveland , I join her in criticizing the people who run the railroad . At half past two in the morning , the train makes its first stop since leaving Cleveland  --  at Erie , Pennsylvania  --  and many people get off , but I do n't see anyone hoarding . From the train , I can see nothing with color in Erie , Pennsylvania , except , in the distance , two glowing golden arches . The woman who was sitting next to me has gone off to End a double seat she can sleep in . I decide to walk around . The car ahead of mine is in complete darkness . All the blinds are drawn , and all the people are sound asleep . It is very snug and warm in this car . Later , the conductor tells me that the lights in this car do n't work at all , whereas the heating works too well . I walk up to the dining car , which is four cars away and open only for lounging . There are two waiters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start saying almost crude things to me . I am not flustered at all  --  I just look at them and start harking like a dog . They shut up and leave the car . To myself I say , " Those two men are lucky I am not God . " The train , which is going much faster than before , seems to be the only thing alive at this early hour of the morning . I go back to my seat to try to sleep . I take a pillow from an overhead rack . The pillowcase is white , but it looks and feels exactly like Handi-Wipes . I fall asleep , and this is what wakes me up : a man going through the car saying over and over , in a singsong way , " First call for breakfast . " I like the way he says this so much that I would like to be able to push a button and have that very man appear and say those very words whenever I want . This is the first time I can actually feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I remember how much I like trains : that I like trains because they seem to be one of the mnre civilized ways to travel with a lot of other people ; that I like to say to people , " I 'm going by train , " just because of the way it sounds ; and that being on a train makes me feel important , and the nice thing about this feeling of importance is that no one need ever know about it and so ruin it for me . I go off to have breakfast , and find waiting on me the two waiters who were so rude the night before . And now they are addressing me as " Ma'am " and " Miss . " For breakfast , I want to have pancakes , but when I see that they are regular-size pancakes , and not the silver-dollar size , I order French toast . The French toast arrives  --  three huge triangular hunks of trustless bread soaked in eggs and milk and then deep-fried . I eat it , and in a way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way it is the best French toast I have ever eaten . It is the worst French toast because it is just plain not good food . It is the best French toast because the time is half past seven in the morning and I am on a train that is on its way out of Buffalo and heading for New York . I get to New York fourteen and a half hours after boarding in Cleveland . I know that people can go to Europe and transact business and return in that span , and I think that 's very nice . But I have had a neat old time just sitting at the train window boolcing at snow-covered farmhouses , frozen rivers , and miles and miles of snow-covered roads as they went by . And I have enjoyed myself so much that at the end of my trip I forgive the people at Amtrak for not running the trains on time , for not having good food , for not having the nicest waiters , and for just generally not being on the ? ball , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by train . Von Sydow AX VON SYDOW , with whom we had a quick lunch the other day , has the longest face in movies since Stan Laurel . Von Sydow has done a comic turn or two on the Swedish stage , but on the screen , unlike Laurel , he has never played his face for laughs . Indeed , ever since 1956 , when , at twenty-seven , he appeared in Ingmar Bergman 's " The Seventh Seal " as a knight returned from the Crusades , von Sydow has been film 's most reliable totem of dignity , gravity , and a kind of lonely wisdom . ( His tendency to be cast in this sort of role reached its apogee in 1965 , when he broke into Hollywood picturemaking as Jesus Christ in " The Greatest Story Ever Told . " ) It does n't hurt that he 's six feet four inches tall , of course , or that he is one of the best actors in the world , but the face is really what does it . On the screen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it seems to enfold the viewer from above and below . At lunch , the von Sydow face had plenty of dignity , but the lonely wisdom seemed more like calm intelligence , and the gravity had apparently taken the day off . Von Sydow , tanned , relaxed , and dressed in shades of brown and mustard , was in town for the opening ? of a new movie he is in , and he was looking forward to a visit , later in the day , from his son Clas , who is twenty-three and a senior at Harvard . ( He has another son , Henrik , nineteen years old , who is a university student in Sweden , and he himself lives in Rome . ) The new movie is " Voyage of the Damned , " an elaborate production with a large cast , including  --  besides von Sydow  --  Faye Dunaway , Oskar Werner , Malcolm McDowell , Orson Welles , James Mason , and about a dozen others whose names and faces any alert moviegoer would recognize . The film is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war began , when the Nazis allowed nine hundred and thirty-seven Jews to leave Hamburg on a German cruise ship , the St. Louis , hound for Havana . The trip was planned as a propaganda ploy , for the Nazis , feeling certain that the passengers would not be allowed ashore , hoped to demonstrate what they regarded as the hypocrisy of the outside world 's concern for the German Jews . The St. Louis sailed north after being turned away from Cuba , and , shockingly , she was forbidden by the American authorities to enter any United States port ; they sent a Coast Guard cutter to intercept her and escort her away . For a while , it looked as if the refugees might have to go hack to Germany , but at the last minute they were accepted by Britain , France , the Netherlands , and Belgium ; most of those in the last three countries died when JANUARY 17. 19 7 7 the countries were overrun by the Nazis . The film has the aesthetics of a soap opera , but von Sydow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ship 's captain , who was not in on the hoax and was chosen by the Nazis precisely because he was politically independent of them . " There are two great differences between the captain as he was and as I play him , " von Sydow told us . " The first is that the real Captain Schroeder was a tiny man . He was the smallest captain in the German merchant marine . I was sorry that there was nothing I could do about that , because I think it is good to see a physically small man being very strong . The second is that the real Captain Schroeder did everything he could to make the passengers feel comfortable from the very beginning . In the movie , in order to build suspense , that revelation is delayed . In reality , even before the voyage the captain invited any members of the crew who did not want to accompany this group of passengers to sign off , and he told those crew members who remained that any discrimination or lapse in standards would be punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on luxuries , He insisted that everyone be treated as if it were an ordinary tourist voyage . And , as the film shows , he was very concerned that the passengers reach safety , even to the extent of secretly planning to start a fire and abandon ship off the coast of England . After the war , because of his involvement in this affair , he was tried by the Allies , but he was acquitted , and was ultimately given a medal by the West German gave rnm ent . " As a boy , von Sydow said , he , like other Swedish children , was insulated from the war by his country 's neutrality . " But after Denmark was invaded , and the refugees started coming in , we understood well enough what was going on , " he continued . " Planes sometimes tried to get over to Sweden from the fighting . And I remember clearly when the prisoners from the concentration camps were brought through . " Von Sydow is himself partly of German extraction . His great-grandfather moved to Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is now in Poland . The name is pronounced " su'd5v , " with the " u " pronounced as in French . Von Sydow grew up in Lund , the seat of one of Sweden 's two great universities . He was an only child , and his father was a professor of Scandinavian and Irish folklore . " My father was a good storyteller , " von Sydow said . " Every day , he told me a folktale or , when I was older , read from a novel for half an hour to my mother and inc . He did n't perform , but he read very well . " Von Sydow found his vocation when he was a junior in high school , he said . He and a friend established their own theatre group and began to put on plays by Strindherg and Lagcrkvist . Von Sydow 's parents wanted him to go to the university , but he wanted to he an actor . " I was a year younger than the others getting out of high school , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts , affiliated with the Royal Dramatic Theatre . My parents thought , If he gets in , O.K. If not , he 's young enough to try something else . Besides , the new president of the Royal Dramatic Theatre was an art professor from Lund , and a friend of theirs . " Von Sydow got in , and appeared in two movies , both directed by Alf Sj6berg , before his graduation . In 1955 , he began his association with Ingmar Bergman , eleven years his senior , when both were members of the Municipal Theatre of Malmo . ( Bergman directed von Sydow as Brick in a production of " Cat on a Hot Tin Roof . " ) Von Sydow has appeared in eleven of Bergman 's films . He spoke to us of Bergman with passionate respect . We asked him what he had learned from his mentor , and he said , " I learned a good working discipline and a certain economy of expression . " " What do you mean by a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are supposed to do . Trying to cut out all the foolishness . Trying to simplify , and put the accent in the right places . Trying to economize on facial expressions , using them fully only when they are really needed . Knowing how to build up tension . Another thing I learned from him is not to take the classics too seriously . Many times , when you see a classic being performed , the actors look as if they were in a museum , or in church . Bergman knows how to bring a classic down to everyday life , to joke about it . He is not afraid . " Spuds ( Contd . ) QLTR readers ' - service course ? - .1 in potatoes , which a few weeks ago featured a lecture by Cecil D. Andrus , the Governor of Idaho  --  now Secretary-designate of the Interior  --  continues with a reading of excerpts from the minutes we took at a daylong year-end seminar on carbohydrates conducted at the new United Nations Plaza Hotel by the Potato Board , a Denver , Colorado , institution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the Dag HammarskjOld Room , with a few remarks by Robert L. Mercer , executive vice-president of the board . " I am a potato man , " he said , in a no-nonsense way . He presented Ronald M. Deutsch , a Californian who is the author of the forthcoming " Food Counter 's Guide " and other instructive hooks , who was to serve as master of ceremonies , and who addressed his auditors as " you guys , " though in fact the persons in attendance , numbering thirty or so , were almost exclusively female  --  food editors and writers , including a couple of alert observers from Weight Watchers Magazine . Mr. Deutsch , an unabashed potato man himself , said that carbohydrates constitute the only efficient fuel there is for the functioning of the human brain ; he coupled that observation with the reflection that President Nixon 's White House lunches often consisted of cottage cheese and ketchup . Mr. Deutsch undertook to scotch three nasty rumors : that hypoglycemia  --  low blood sugar  --  comes from overindulgence in carbohydrates ; that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins ; and that children 's temper tantrums are induced by carbohydrates . Mr. Deutsch concluded with an unsparing attack on Dr. David Reuben , who has written everything everybody presumably wants to know about both sex and diet , and who currently appears to he one of the blackest bEtes noires in nutrition circles . " You do not have to give up sex in favor of picking celery strings out of your teeth , " said Mr. Deutsch . While we were trying to figure that one out , Dr. T. S. Danowski , an endocrinologist and nutritionist at the University of Pittsburgh , took the floor . He talked at highly technical length about reactive hypoglycemia , saying that many factors contribute to low blood sugar after eating but that there is invariably a delay in the corrective responses of the body , no matter what the patient has eaten . Dr. Danowski also thought it ill-advised that a certain anti-carbohydrate physician appeared to he spending money that ought to he devoted to research on buying dogs that walk on two legs . While we were mulling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. Sabry , a Canadian biochemist and nutritionist , who , the m.c. declared , had studied the eating habits of compatriots ranging from Eskimos to Quebecois separatists and thus had a broader overview of the North American diet than just about anybody else around . Dr. Sabry said he would try to put carbohydrates in perspective . With the caveat that this was an oversimplification , he asserted that at least ten per cent of the ideally balanced American diet should be obtained from proteins , no more than thirty per cent from fats , and the rest from carbohydrates . Then he launched an attack on potato chips vis-a-vis boiled potatoes . Did we know that  --  before adjusting for water  --  one hundred grams of boiled potatoes contain only sixty-five calories , as opposed to five hundred and seventy-five for the same weight of chips ? " We messed up the product in making something else , " he stated . He said that it was important to persuade consumers to discourage manufacturers from turning out such stuff . " The responsibility lies with you as communicators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balance of diet in North America . " IVe felt uncommonly set up . Next , all hands trooped into the Trygve Lie Room for cocktails . A woman from Family Circle said she did n't know how long she could stay . " I 'm supposed to be doubling with a birth-control thing at the Ford Foundation , " she explained . A man sporting a necktie with chemical symbols on it  --  another biochemist and nutritionist , David Kritchevsky , who was slated to speak after lunch  --  told us , " I used to be considered an expert on fibres in the diet . Then along came Dr. David Reuben . In his ' Save Your Life Diet , ' he promises you eternal life . If you want a book that does that , you 'd do better to try the Bible . It 's cheaper , and it 's got racy pas.sages . I reviewed his book for the Journal of Nutrition Education , but my last paragraph had to be removed on advice of counsel . " At lunch , in the U Thant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman and a Potato Board woman . During the prosciutto and papaya , Ms. Potato Board said that Ron Deutsch had been most helpful in the board 's " misunderstood-potato " campaign , and had also written a hook on the sexual responses of women . There seemed to be some connec tion between potatoes and sex which we never quite grasped . During the broiled filet of sole , with carrots , broccoli , and boiled potatoes , Ms. Idaho said that she had lost ten pounds last summer while eating huge quantities of baked potatoes . " I fool myself by covering them with cottage cheese and chives , which I mix in a blender and which come out tasting like sour cream , " she said . She added that potato chips , which had been so properly put in their place earlier , were not as a rule made from Idaho spuds . " I think potato-chip potatoes come from the East Coast , " she said . " We 've got to persuade the all-American male that eating a twelve-ounce steak is wrong , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Particularly when preceded by a shrimp cocktail , " said a Weight Watcher down the table . " It 's a crime ! ' " I know a restaurant that offers a seventy-two-ounce steak , " Dr. Sabry chimed in . " If you can finish it , you get it for free . Otherwise , you have to pay a fifty-dollar fine . " We asked him where the place was . " I wo n't tell you , " he said , " except that it 's somewhere in Canada . " The Reading THE third annual non-stop reading of " The Making of Americans , " Gertrude Stein 's **32;5372;TOOLONG family chronicle , began promptly at noon on Friday , December 31st , in the Paula Cooper Gallery , a large , white-walled ground-floor room in SoHo . Valda Setterfield was the first reader . Valda , who is a dancer , and who was horn in England , read in a quiet , well-modulated voice , sitting behind a folding table at one end of the room . " Once an angry man dragged his father along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Stop ! ' cried the groaning old man at last . ' Stop ! I did not drag my father beyond this tree . ' " After reading for about twenty minutes , she turned and nodded to Lucinda Childs , who was sitting beside her at the table , and Lucinda took over the reading . She read at about the same speed and volume as Valda , but her voice was pitched a little higher . Lucinda , who is a choreographer and dancer , recently appeared as a featured performer in the Robert Wilson-Philip Glass opera " Einstein on the Beach , " at the Metropolitan Opera House . By a nice coincidence , Robert Wilson 's graphite drawings for the " Einstein " sets were on the walls of the gallery during the reading , which continued without a break from noon on Friday until just after two-thirty on Sunday afternoon , some fifty hours later . There were nine people in the audience when the reading began . Most of them sat on the floor , because there was only a single small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heavy sweaters or parkas or overcoats on , because the temperature outside was twenty above zero ( Fahrenheit ) , and every now and then someone would come in the door and let in some of the outside temperature . At twenty past twelve , John Cage , the composer , came in , wearing a sheepskin coat and carrying a copy of " The Making of Americans " in one hand . " There 's John Cage , " a young man whispered excitedly to the young woman he was sitting with . The young man fished a Leica out of his sweater and took a photograph of John Cage taking off his sheepskin . A few minutes later , while Lucinda Childs was reading , Cage seated himself at the table , in Valda Setter-field 's just vacated place , and then he read for a while . " It 's a great question this question of washing , " Cage read . " One never can find any one who can be satisfied with anybody else 's washing . " He went on to read about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreadful question of the winter washing . " He read more slowly than Valda or Lucinda , and he made it sound as though he were talking rather than reading . ( Later , he told us he felt that the book should be read as though it made sense , because it did . Cage also said that because " The Making of Americans " was too big a book to read alone , this marathon reading aloud seemed to him an excellent idea . ) We did not stay for the entire reading . We left at about two o'clock on Friday afternoon , in fact , and went about our Friday-afternoon business , and our Friday-night , New Year 's Eve business , and our Saturday-morning pulling-ourself-together business , and we next looked in on the Paula Cooper at three o'clock on Saturday afternoon . About fifty people were on hand then , sitting against the walls or against columns that hold up the ceiling , and listening quietly to a young man with very copious hair and a young woman with not so copious hair who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state and city taxes . That 'll be $14,982.63 for Governor Carey and Mayor Beame. " reading together rather trickily , we thought  --  shifting off to one another in midsentence sometimes , and sometimes reading along in unison . Some listeners were stretched out full-length on the floor . Others were in the lotus position , the half-lotus position , or the not-quitelotus position . Many listeners ' feet were encased in thick , high leather boots , and others in interestingly striped running shoes . Perhaps a dozen listeners had their own copies of " The Making of Americans , " and were following the text as music students follow a score at a concert . The general atmosphere seemed just this side of devout . It was still very cold outside . Meredith Monk , the composer and dancer , was reading aloud when we came in again , on Sunday morning . About thirty-five people were present , three of whom were sound asleep . We spotted Jean Rigg , one of the organizers of the reading , and went back to the gallery offices with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law ; before that , she was the administrator for Merce Cunningham and Dance Company . She introduced us to Alison Knowles , an intermedia artist , and Edward Burns , an author and Gertrude Stein scholar , who had assisted with this year 's reading . Alison Knowles told us she had been travelling since Christmas , from Italy to Vermont and from
