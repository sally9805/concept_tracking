txt Signs of progress in putting the cease-fire machinery into operation finally are visible here . After a full week 's delay due to actmuustrative and procedural obstacles , the cumberspme truce agreement forged in Paris now is lumbering into action ? in Saigon now , and soon in the outlying provinces of Vietnam , too . As of Monday , the first observer truce teams of the International Commission on Control and Supervision ( ICCS ) set forth from this southern capital city for the seven regional headquarters to which they were assigned by the cease-fire document . The seven bases are Hue , Da Nang , Pleiku , Phan Thiet , Bien Hoa , My Tho and Can Tho . Observer teams composed of Canadian , Hungarian , Indonesian , and Polish components will reach these destinations approximately one week later than originally expected . The consensus here is that , beside extra casualties and damage , no great blow has been dealt to the cause of peace during the delay so far . No charges admitted As North and South Vietnamese fought during the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam . Of 241 hamlets penetrated by Communist forces , according to Saigon officials , only 31 still are being contested . // * Cease-fire machinery moves // The other 210 hamlets attacked by North Vietnamese or Viet Cong forces all have been retaken , South Vietnam claims . " Considering the national Tet holiday ( marking the lunar new year ) , it is most commendable that the truce teams are beginning to move out this soon , " a Saigon official commented . The expectation , however , is that it will take another few days at a minimum for the observers to respond to calls to investigate actual cease-fire violations in person on the scene . Newsmen in Saigon , meanwhile , were treated to their first public view of Viet Cong officers on Sunday . The Viet Cong officers drove into the city from Tan Son Nhut air base for a joint meeting of the ICCS with the four-party Joint Military Commission ( JMC ) of which they are members . Friendliness exhibited These short , sturdy men , wearing green pith helmets and green jungle fatigues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendliness . They are representatives of the fighters , who , for the past eight years and with increasing North Vietnamese help , fought American and South Vietnamese military might more or less to a standstill . They said they were glad to come home ( to Saigon ) after so many years away . But their friendly gestures were not reciprocated by members of the South Vietnamese delegation or their police guards . One burly southerner flistly refused to shake when a Viet Cong man offered his hand . In the seven days since the official end of hostilities , South Vietnam admits to 590 of its soldiers killed , 2,282 wounded , and 292 missing ; plus 19 civilians killed , 126 wounded , and 2 abducted . Casualties tallied The Communist toll in the same interval , according to Saigon military sources , is 3,705 killed , and 127 captured . Thus one week of illegal combat apparently has cost the two belligerents well over 7,000 casualties . With the ICCS well on the way to surmounting its first hurdle of getting its men out into the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JMC on Sunday was free to turn to another all-important item ? the release and exchange of war prisoners . Any activity of this delayed item , needless to say , will be another welcome sign of progress here . For the American chief representative on the Joint Military Commission , U.S. Maj. Gen. Gilbert Woodward , release of American prisoners has top priority . One incidental ICCS problem , meanwhile , threatened to be the difficulty in attracting sufficient South Vietnamese interpreters . Some southerners , according to a reliable informant , are reluctant to sign on with the commission that may not endure beyond its initial two-month span . They also are concerned that they might be suspected of working secretly for American or South Vietnamese intelligence or security , which might get them into trouble later on . Interpreters must have a security clearance , of course , but some of them reportedly do not want to have service with the truce-keeping commission on their record for the future .                   @ @
