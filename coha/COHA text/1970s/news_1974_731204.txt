txt U.S. Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger called this week 's meeting of oil consumers in Washington a " success " and indeed , in two respects , it was . It did set up a continuing group to work cooperatively toward long-term solutions of the energy problem . And it did see the survival of the theory of West European cooperation with the United States . The concept of an Atlantic community lives . But to get this into proportion it needs to be noted that this survival of the Atlantic community concept was a " near thing . " Not since Charles de Gaulle ordered American troops out of France in 1967 has the idea of that community been so hard pressed as during this conference . Different viewpoints The French saw the conference as an American device to attempt to reassert American dominance over Western Europe . Dr. Kissinger saw it as a cooperative attempt to apply the machinery of the Atlantic community to the problems of energy . Twinned with this struggle by different names was the issue over French leadership of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined struggle between French and Americans for the loyalty of the eight non-French members of the Common Market community who attended the conference . Were they to follow Foreign Minister Michel Jobert of France or Secretary Kissinger of the United States ? // *NATO ties survive // And in the end the eight stayed with the Americans and the French took up an ' ambiguous position about oil and energy . Perhaps they will take part in some further conference . Perhaps they wo n't . They did not break totally or definitely with the eight , or with Washington . Painful choice One way of summarizing it all is to say that the French tried to lead their Common Market partners out of the Atlantic community ? and failed . When the eight had to choose between Paris and Washington they found the choice painful . But they stayed with Secretary Kissinger . The desperately serious question left over from all this is whether Dr. Kissinger 's " success " was a nostalgic clinging to a receding Atlantic ideal or a demonstration of the solid permanence of that community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the true picture . As so often in war , diplomacy , and politics the follow-up determines how great or illusory is the outcome of the immediate battle . At the very least Dr. Kissinger , who for so long has been preoccupied with the Far East and Middle East and has neglected Europe , now has a chance to try to repair the years of neglect . It was indeed such a " near thing " here in Washington that he has been warned . Many diplomats in Washington and all NATO capitals see the policy of detente with Russia as being incompatible with NATO and the Atlantic community . Dr. Kissinger insists that they are compatible . Yet he also talks about a five-power world in the future and about floating balances of power , which implies fluid relationships among the five . If all the relationships are to be fluid , then Western Europe floats by itself , no longer tied firmly by treaties of alliance to the United States . Also Dr. Kissinger is accustomed to speaking in highly critical terms of the European allies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting which Dr. Kissinger held on last Dec. 6 with seven Jewish professors and writers . He is quoted in the memo as having described the behavior of the Europeans over the oil crisis as " craven , " " contemptible , " and " pernicious . " The use of these works has not been denied . They rankle among the Europeans . Of course this is by no means the first time a question has been raised about the applicability of NATO to some particular crisis . When tested over Korea , it did apply , but only just . When tested over the French at Dien Bien Phu it did not apply . When tested over an American role in Vietnam it did not apply . Events have proved that NATO certainly is valid over a Soviet threat to Western Europe . But they also show that an extension outside Europe is highly doubtful . The Europeans no more backed Dr. Kissinger over the Arab oil issue than they did over Vietnam . But the fact remains that the French have resumed what amounts to a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are back to the days of President De Gaulle . How serious is it and how tenacious ? And will the other Europeans continue to choose Washington whenever Paris tempts them to pull away ? The fact is that the detente policy is washing away at the foundations of the alliance and is testing them . The meeting in Washington is a jolting reminder that NATO will not survive automatically . Positive effort is needed to keep it sturdy and in line with the times . To many , it already seems to belong to the past .
