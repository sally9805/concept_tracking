" It was made abundantly clear to me that as long as the present circumstances in Rhodesia prevailed , we could expect no help or support of any kind from the Free World . On the contrary , the pressures on us from the Free World would continue to mount . " <P> With those words Rhodesia 's Prime Minister Ian Smith last week told his countrymen in a grave 20-minute television address that the Rhodesian " rebellion " was at an end . Nearly eleven years after his government had declared its independence from British rule and its determination to maintain white minority rule in the landlocked territory . Smith and his colleagues capitulated . On behalf of their 275,000 white countrymen , they agreed to a British-American plan to transfer power to Rhodesia 's 6 million blacks within the next two years . The Western powers , Smith said calmly , " have made up their minds as to the kind of solution they wish to see in Rhodesia , and they are determined to bring it about . " To put it more bluntly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused . <P> Impressive Feat . At week 's end , a shadow was cast on the settlement when five black African nations rejected it , saying that acceptance would , in effect , legalize " colonialist and racist structures of power . " The presidents of Zambia , Mozambique , Tanzania , Angola and Botswana called instead for Britain to convene a constitutional convention outside of Rhodesia . Still , the U.S. State Department seemed unconcerned , saying that the five nations had apparently accepted " the essentials " of the agreement . <P> In any event , Smith 's decision marked one of the more impressive feats of U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger , who had laid the groundwork this summer during two meetings in Europe with South Africa 's Prime Minister John Vorster . Under the plan , the Rhodesian regime agreed to set up an interim government to pave the way for majority rule . It will include a council of state headed by a white , possibly Smith himself , and a council of ministers to be led by a black " First Minister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites were promised that steps would be taken to end both the black guerrilla fighting along Rhodesia 's borders and the international economic sanctions imposed upon the country following its breakaway from Britain . The U.S. and other countries would also establish a fund to insure whites against financial losses as a result of the shift to majority rule .
