Publication and Preservation <P> Sir : The New York Times June 28 is to be commended for the publication of excerpts from the secret Pentagon report on U.S. involvement in Viet Nam . At the same time , the U.S. Government 's case to restrain further publication of these official secrets is justified . But on balance , if we look beyond the letter of the law . the action of the New York Times has made a genuine contribution to the preservation of free institutions . <P> HECTOR A. MENDEZ New York City <P> Sir : Has the Times become so sacrosanct that it is considered above the Government and the welfare of the country ? If its actions are now condoned , that will automatically give license to anyone who chooses to rifle Government security material according to his own judgment . <P> H.L. GRAY Washington <P> Sir : To those who brand the embroiled newspapers as " irresponsible , " may we raise a question : To whom is the Government responsible , if not to the very people whose learning it is so avidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisdome " that may be implemented at the polls if arbitrary power blunts their ability to know ? BARBARA E. SCHAEFER Westfield , N.J. <P> Sir : After reading the recent disclosures on the Viet Nam War in the New York Times , I say we should turn the L.B.J. Library into a mausoleum for our Viet Nam War dead . <P> JOHN M. PARA Binghamton , N.Y . <P> <P> Freeze-Dried Souls <P> Sir : Your article on the Jesus people June 21 was good news . But I read the words of the doubting people with impatience . They want to see mature faith instantly , as if souls were like so much freeze-dried coffee just waiting for the hot water and the swish of the spoon . I hate to see these hard hearts jumping in to squelch a new batch of turned-on people . Faith is an ugly thing to nonbelievers . It hurts to hope for something as big as universal love . It 's a pain worth having . <P> NANCY ANDERSON Manhattan Beach , Calif . <P> Sir : To answer the critics who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can happily say that we are singleminded , not narrow-minded . Having the ultimate solution gives us that privilege . <P> WILLIAM D. KOONS Houston <P> Sir : Drugs , drugs , drugs ! The Jesus Freaks have switched from pot and LSD to the opiate of the masses . <P> R.K. O'CAiN Columbia . S.C . <P> Sir : Do n't knock it ' til you 've tried it . LEROY G. BULLER , " Jesus Freak " Topeka , Kans . <P> Sir : As a black revolutionary woman evangelist and a representative of pur black youth , all I have to say about the <P> Jesus Freaks is keep them in the white community . As black people we have suffered enough " pollution of the mind " from white people . They gave us Jesus a long time ago , took everything else that was tangible and left us with the Spirit . <P> ( Rev. Sister ) IMAGENE WILLIAMS Prime Minister <P> Church of What 's Happening Now Washington <P> Sir : It is berserk to think of Jesus as a revolutionary . He was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants its subjects to model themselves after Jesus , the cheerful maker of his own execution . The Indians were given reservations and Bibles . Early labor leaders competed with evangelists , and now they are trying to water down the youth revolution . <P> <P> FRED MORSE
