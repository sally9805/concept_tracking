Photographer Ansel Adams is the Grand Old Man of a still young art <P> In a big redwood house above the shifting kelp beds and nocturnal sea of Carmel , an old man is playing the piano , not too well . The room is large , worn and comfortable , decked with the heterogeneous souvenirs of a long life-rows of Indian pottery , elegantly woven tribal baskets and a huge Chinese ceremonial drum . The piano player 's head , a bald mass , gleams in the light . His hands , swollen from arthritis , hardened by decades of immersion in darkroom chemicals , skitter over the keys , assaulting the same phrase again and again . " Damn , " he says , " I 've lost it . " But not altogether . Once you have practiced to concert discipline , even 50 years ago , the traces still show . " There used to be a relationship between my piano and my photography , " says Ansel Adams . " I guess it 's one-sided now . " <P> Today , at 77 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographer in America . His images of landscape , and particularly of Yosemite National Park in California , have become almost indistinguishable from their subjects : to many people , Yosemite is the apparition on Adams ' viewfinder . " Wo n't it be wonderful when a million people can see what we are seeing today ! " exclaimed John Muir , the founder of the Sierra Club , as he gazed on Yosemite seven decades ago . Last year 2.7 million tourists went to Yosemite . One may fairly assume that most of their innumerable frames of 35-mm and Polaroid film were exposed in the hope of trapping their own Ansel Adams image , rather as tourists in 18th century Italy sometimes carried a smoked lens called a Claude Glass , through which the landscapes of the Roman Campagna could be seen in the mellow brown tone of Claude Lorrain 's canvases . To that public , Adams is as American as John Wayne : the last portraitist of Western sublimity . <P> Somewhat like his photos , Adams is larger than life . More than a million copies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yosemite and the Range of Light ( New York Graphic Society ; $75 ) , will be published next week . The publication is timed to coincide with " Ansel Adams and the West , " a two-month retrospective of 153 of his landscape photographs , organized by the Museum of Modern Art 's director of the department of photography , John Szarkowski , and opening at MOMA next week . In workshop sessions over the years , Adams has personally taught at least 4,500 students . Original prints of his photos may number as high as 30,000 . The most sought-after of these images , Moonrise , Hernandez , New Mexico ( 1941 ) , exists in an edition of about 900 , and the going price for each one is $8,000 . <P> Adams ' work-and his 60-year association with the Sierra Club , including 37 years as a member of its board of directors-has exerted a steady pressure on U.S. conservation and parks policy . Adams ' limited-edition book Sierra Nevada : The John Muir Trail ( 1938 ) helped persuade Franklin D. Roosevelt to shepherd a bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California into a national park .
