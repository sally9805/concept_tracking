THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ON a recent night . a WALK sign lay on the sidewalk on Vesey Street near the World Trade Center . The post it was attached to had probably been knocked over by a truck backing up . The cable running through the post was intact , and the WALK sign was still flashing its signals in unison with its twin on the other side of Vesey Street . Unlike its mundane twin , however , this WALK sign , flashing its signals up into the night sky , was now part of a whole new intersection . The new intersection was vast and invisible . Its crosswalk lines presumably ran parallel to the IVorld Trade Center towers for the first quarter mile or so , but the other side of the crosswalk was so far away that it could not he seen in the heavens . The people crossing Vesey Street , their minds on other things , did not notice the possibilities of the new intersection that the WALK sign had turned its face to . During the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this side of the new intersection to wait to start across . And on the other side were there pedestrians so far away that only hundreds of billions of years from now , when our earth had become a cold cinder , would they find out that it was O.K. to walk ? What kind of pedestrians were they that could walk through space on conceptual planes ? What kind of many-light-year hoots would they have to wear to cross in the forty seconds of a WALK cycle ? What would run over them if they did n't make it ? ? ? Wonderful FOR reasons of their own , Christopher Little and David White firmly believe that this life , dammit , is a wonderful life . Annually , they throw a small party to celebrate that shared perception of reality . 1Vhat they do at the party is this : they have a few drinks and eat a few ham sandwiches and then they watch an old movie on television . Specifically , they watch " It 's a Wonderful Life " ( 1946 , Frank Capra , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same movie , and every year , with slight variations , the same audience conies to watch  --  fifteen or twenty friends who agree that Jimmy Stewart is a great guy and Donna Reed is a swell and pretty girl and Lionel Barrymore makes a convincing villain . The eighth annual " It 's a Wonderful Life " party took place one night shortly after Christmas in David White 's apartment , on the East Side . When we arrived , a few minutes ahead of the rest of the guests , White , who used to be a reporter for the Times and now spends his days finishing a novel , was busy with last-minute preparations . " This thing always gets shown on television around Christmastime , and we pore over every word of TV Guide trying to find out when , " he said as he sliced ham . " Once , we got stuck with a late-afternoon showing , which meant that we had to invite people to start drinking at four o'clock . Believe it or not , there were some people who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . We had to strike them from the invitation list . Nothing strictly personal , of course , but they 've been permanently banned . Well , it 's not really a permanent ban . You can get back on the list if you 've got a doctor 's excuse or a note from your mother . This year , Channel 5 broadcast the movie on Christmas Day at twelvethirty  --  in the middle of the day . Indecent . Naturally , we could n't get anyone to show up for that , so we decided to hold the party tonight , even though Christmas is over . Fortunately , with great foresight we taped the movie last year on a Betamax machine for just such a situation . I think it 's a pretty good tape . We edited out all the commercials , so you wo n't be seeing any Kitchen Magician or Crazy Eddie ads . The Betamax is over there . " He pointed to a compact machine on top of a desk . " At the appropriate moment , the ground-service crew will move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . " People began to arrive now . Christopher Little , a photographer who lives in Chelsea , was among them , He shook White 's hand , nodded gravely , and said , " Wonderful life , David . " " Wonderful life , Christopher , " White said sternly . Several people in the room had seen the movie more times than they could remember . Jane Bayard , an assistant curator at the Yale University Art Gallery , did remember . " This is the seventh time for me , " she said . " I 've seen it more than any other movie . " " It 's a violation of the rules to watch this movie out of town or during the off-season , " said Little . " Hawaii in July , for instance  --  strictly forbidden . Technically , it 's possible not to like the movie but to love this party as an institution . " " No , " said Jane Bayard . " I think it 's necessary to love the movie . " " For sheer raw emotional power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Patrick Curley , " I do n't think you can beat the scene where Jimmy 26 JANUARY 1 5 1 9 7 9 Stewart leans over that bridge railing , having decided not to commit suicide after all , and says , ' I want to live ! I want to live ! ' " " Patrick was in Jerusalem during last year 's party , " Jane said . " I looked all through the Jerusalem television listings , " he said . " I guess the movie is n't that popular over there . " Our invitation had noted that a special guest was going to be present . As we were surveying the room looking for someone charismatic , Little said , " Trying to pick out the special guest , I see . I 'm afraid that fell through . David 's girlfriend , Margaret Stanhack , works with a woman who used to he a friend of the next-door neighbor of the girlfriend of Jimmy Stewart 's nephew . We thought the nephew would be here tonight , but he had to go to Florida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have made it . We 're thinking of waiting until the tenth annual celebration before we get Uncle Jimmy and Donna Reed involved . But I 'm sure they 'll accept . " It was almost time for the Betamax machine to be turned on . While Patrick Curley cleaned the television screen with Windex , David White made a brief speech . " You may wonder why you 've all been invited here tonight , " he said . " The story begins , in at least one important respect , the same way that the story of the birth of Jesus Christ begins , and that is that it begins on a dark and wintry night . It was 1970 , and three desperate college students  --  Christopher Little , myself , and Christopher 's sister Suzanne  --  home on vacation with nothing better to do , spent the evening watching a movie on television . That movie was ' The Miracle of the Bells . ' And when it ended , at one-thirty in the morning , we flipped the channel selector and stumbled across another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these immortal words : ' Wait . I 've seen this movie before . It 's a greet movie . ' Christopher spoke as if another miracle were at hand , and we could only have faith . And he was right . So now , even though Christmas is over and you 've all unwrapped your neckties and blouses , you still need Donna Reed and Jimmy Stewart to remind you that there may not yet be peace in the Middle East , the dollar may he unstable , inflation may be rampant , but it is a wonderful life . " There was brief applause . Then the lights went out , the television screen brightened , the opening credits rolled , and the room filled with the sound of deeply contented sighing . About fifteen minutes into the movie , Christopher Little , who had been lying on the floor , stood up and went to mix himself a drink . " I 'll be right back , " he said to no one in particular . " Tell me what happens , will you ? " Homecoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New jersey on a frosty Tuesday afternoon when , as our train paused at the crumbly station of the once famous Erie Railroad in Paterson , we were unexpectedly joined for the sixteen-mile run to Hoboken by a friend of long standing  --  E. M. Frimbo , the inexhaustible railway buff . Some months ago , we recalled , he had reached his temporary goal of travelling two and a half million miles by train . " A trip like this is no way to make it three million miles , if that 's your game , " we remarked as he sat down beside us . " I know , " he said . " But there 's a reason . I 've just come from a sort of family reunion . " And , without our asking for an explanation , he launched himself into one , exactly like this : Homecoming at year 's end is always a time of bliss for us old settlers , even when the homestead may have seen better days , and today Paterson had a celebration for a distinguished citizen , born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our family was deep in the Industrial Revolution , back in Lancashire and Yorkshire , and was still in it when some of us came across here to a new country . You 've heard of it  --  the Thirteen Original Colonies . Paterson was its first , or nearly its first , industrial citadel ; Alexander Hamilton was involved in the founding of Paterson , in the guise of The Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures . Then Major L'Enfant had a hand , and sometimes two , in the laying out of the town , after he had been south to plan the intricate system of streets and avenues and circles for a new nation 's new capital . At first , our family 's Industrial Revolutionists were building waterwheels and other machinery for cotton and woollen mills in New England , but they began building steam locomotives in Paterson as far back as 1837 , in the Rogers engine works . Oh , Paterson was quite the fine little industrial capital . There were three other important engine works ; there were silk-weaving and silk-dyeing establishments by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submarine there , and tried it out in the Passaic River , which flows through the town ; it was there that Samuel Colt built the gun mill that turned out his famous revolver ; and there , later on , the Wright Aeronautical people built the engine for Lindbergh 's transatlantic hop , and engines for our air forces in both world wars . The locomotives made in the Rogers works , which was big enough to allow thirteen of them to be constructed at a time , were put on flatcars and hauled down Market Street by a team of horses to the Erie Railroad  --  right past the palace-size city hail One of them was the General , a celebrated participant in the Civil War . It was by this course , in reverse , that the distinguished citizen of today came home . Not on a flatcar , though , because the rails have vanished , but on a flatbed truck , to which was nevertheless attached , at the business end , the traditional team of horses . It had to be a truck , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locomotive  --  one that had just recently been retired after years of service as a Usefull Manufacture , and had been built in Paterson in 19I f1 by the Cooke works , a comradely neighbor of the Rogers shops . My special interest in the occasion was that the Cooke was to be domiciled in what can justifiably be called our family manse in Paterson  --  the erecting shop of the Rogers works , which is a tall , peak-roofed , brick-walled , wooden-floored mill . It is in excellent health , despite its years , and is at this moment being readied by an enthusiastic crew of Patersonian craftsmen to carry on through another century , as part museum , part repository , part offices . The fact is that everyone in Paterson seems to he enthusiastic about bringing the town back up to snuff , which is where it has n't been since the modern Industrial Revolution began to pass it by , moving on out West and down South . Among the enthusiasts are the huntsmen who sought out an obtainable indigenous steam engine for the museum ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania . And there are the schoolchildren who contributed nickels and dimes to the project , and the substantial citizens who contributed time and cash and the flatbed truck and the team of horses , and also automobiles in which invited offshoots of the Cooke and the Rogers families travelled across town behind the locomotive this cold and blowy day from the Erie station to the new museum . My automobile was an open-air but splendidly upholstered Chalmers of 1911 , still quite capable of propelling itself and six passengers . Right-hand drive , too ; you do n't get that every day . And  --  to go on with the list of enthusiasts  --  there is Joseph Bograd , the president of the Great Falls Development Corporation ( it was the Great Falls of the Passaic , all of seventy-seven feet high , and its three-tiered raceway that gave the mills , including the Rogers , nestled elbow to elbow along its banks , their water power and their water , of which silk-dyeing uses plenty ) , which , along with the city , is dedicated to the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal government has made the complex a National Historic Landmark  --  that is to say , a perpetually unendangered species  --  and in time it will be fully and usefully reoccupied . And there is Jack Stokvis , Special Projects Manager for the City of Paterson 's Department of Community Development . I met him a couple of years ago in New London when that glorious red brick H. H. Richardson railway station , snatched at the last moment from the claws of " urban redevelopers , " was rededicated after being splendidly put to rights by the Boston outfit that calls itself Anderson Notter &; Fine-gold , Inc. , which has done such good work in rehabilitating many of the nearly de relict Boston-wate rf ron t warehouses . All over the Thirteen Colonies , there are , as these examples demonstrate , many chores to be done in defending and revivifying what you might term our American heritage . I do my share of preserving worthy railway artifacts , and in New London that day I sensed an ally in Stokvis . Now some more enthusiasts . The City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years in office . And Mary Ellen Kramer , wife to the Mayor . It 's an odd thing about American girls who are named Mary Ellen  --  they 're all full of beans . My favorite Mary Ellen had been a wizard at re-covering difficult old furniture and at Greek belly dancing . Now I must add the Kramer Mary Ellen . When she heard that a certain set of predators  --  those who call themselves highway engineers  --  were planning to drive a six-lane elevated road right through the cluster of ancient mills along the Passaic , she set about organizing such a fulminating tumult that the scheme was abandoned ; our family manse is now nestled forever in the arms of the City of Paterson . Well , the parade this day had trouHe getting started . It was to have been headed by the youngest and most energetic marching band I have ever heard  --  contributed by the town 's John F. Kennedy High  --  but the conga prancing of its Long-legged , short-skirted young ladies and the thunder of its drum corps nearly panicked the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in behind them . I and my companions , two of them out of City Hall , followed ih the Chalmers , and other first-generation automobiles followed us . En route , along with Kramer , Bograd , and Stokvis , I took any number of bows from the citizenry , Lord knows why . All other traffic was summarily repressed as we snailed down Market Street to the city hall , where a dozen commendably brief and literate felicitatory addresses were delivered . We then proceeded , again behind the locomotive and that clarion music , to the Rogers works , and climbed the wooden staircase , completely Colonial in its simplicity and handsomeness , to the top floor for a most congratulatory and convivial reception and a look across the town . There is still a good deal of the old Paterson to be seen : the early mills ; the early post office , which is as soaring and flamboyantly Flemish as its progenitor in Haarlem ; the Roman and Grecian temples that masquerade as banks ; the small and serene Hamilton Club , amid whose fluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bograd . And there is still a good deal to he done to restore that old Paterson . I guess I miss the Thirteen Colonies . It was a neat little country . Not a great many comforts  --  long hours , hard work  --  hut reasonably homogeneous : a mingling of us and the French Canadians and the mainland Portuguese and those from the Canaries and the Cape Verde Islands , whom we imported to help run the mills of New England , and the Irish , in such numbers that much of downtown Paterson still bears the name of Dublin , and the Italians , who , along with the Irish , manned the silk mills . But you know how it is . We were merged into a conglomerate called the United States , and there went the neighborhood ; the neighborhood began to empty as the enterprisers evacuated themselves to where the new factories were going to be built . And along came rayon and nylon and the diesel locomotive , and what the mills of New England and Paterson had been turning out no longer seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not in such a blooming hurry to take off from the old homestead when things go wrong , and look for that vanished frontier . If there is now a frontier on this continent , it lies in the upper reaches of the Thirteen Colonies , where underpopulated farmlands and villages , and even towns , are here and there giving way to the wilderness they once replaced . And I hope there are more Kramers and Stokvises and Bo-grads on whom we can count to do something about it . At the Garden WE went with our two music-Toying friends Angie and Louise to see Billy Joe at Madison Square Garden the other night . Angie is twenty-six and an art director ; Louise is thirty-two and works for a historical society . Whenever Angie and Louise are together , no one else can get in a word , so we just took notes : ANGIE : The last concert I went to at the Garden was Bruce Springsteen . I went with Marty , so we got good seats . Marty always gets good seats . He does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks find from a would move ing . LOUT5E : Is that a scalper there ? God , he 's only about fifteen and he looks so tough . All those kids over there look tough . Especially the girls . Is it always tike this at the Garden ? The only other time I was here was for the Stones ' concert three years ago . I hated it . I sat about four blocks back and six stories up , and I felt left out . Even Mick Jagger ca n't project that far . ANGIE : What a weird crowd . " That metallic grinding means her throwout bearings are shot . She 's backfiring through her carburetor . The tick indicates transmission trouble , and the smoke means she 's on fire . " They 're either old or young , and they look as if they were from Long Island . LOUISE : See those little girls ? I bet Gilda Radner looked just like that when the was eleven . Are there always so many parents and kids ? ANG/E I really love Billy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , I only like three that I know of . The lyrics arc witty and they have unexpected melodies . ANGIE : I like Billy Joel 's songs because they 're mostly about the people I grew up with in Bayside . And I like the way he looks , too . His eyes are always bulging right off the record jackets . LOUISE : To me , pop music is strictly eyebrows . A performer is only as good as his eyebrows are raised high . Have you ever seen Bobby Short ? No one can beat Bobby Short when it comes to raised eyebrows . And he should n't even be looking that intense or interested , because he 's usually singing about being bored or jaded . Ever see Steve Lawrence on the Carol Burnett show ? He 's always got ' em up , right ? And Bob Dylan , Arlo Guthrie , Robbie Robertson  --  so do they . If Billy Joel can raise his eyebrows as high in person as he does on his album covers , he must he pretty good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : These are great seats , but right under us is the ice-hockey rink , I wish I had on my furry boots . ANGIE : After Bruce Springsteen , Marty said he 'd never take me to another rock concert . He hates it when I gush over rock stars . LOUISE : My mother saw Billy Joel on " Saturday Night Live . " He 's her idea of such a nice boy . ANGIE : Is " Piano Man " one of your three favorites ? LOUISE : Sounds like Dylan on that one . ANGIE : " The Stranger " ? Lo u ISE : Too punk-rocky . ANGIE : " Vienna " ? " Movin ' Out " ? LOUISE : Too much like Paul McCartney . ANGIE : Marty really gets me ticked off . He says I 'll probably like Barry Manilow next . Marty says , " What 's so special about Billy Joel ? I went to high school with plenty of wisecracking New York kids just like Billy Joel . Most of them are probably carpet salesmen now . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds like twenty thousand people calling a little kid out to play . The lights go down . ANGIE : He ) ! Billy Joel 's not wearing a suit . LOl'ISE : But his bluejeans are pressed .
