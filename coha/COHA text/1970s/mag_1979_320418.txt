Near divorce in the Diet <P> " I feel as if I have finally managed to I get out of hot water , but I must expect to dip into even hotter water . " So said Premier Masayoshi Ohira last week , after he narrowly won a bruising struggle in the Diet to hang on as leader of Japan 's majority government . " The Bull , " as Ohira is known , might be feeling plenty of new heat soon . Though he fended off a strong challenge from his archrival , former Premier Takeo Fukuda , he now finds himself at the top of not only a shaky regime but also a divided party . <P> Ohira 's troubles began with Japan 's Oct. 7 election . Over the objections of other members of his Liberal Democratic Party ( L.D.P. ) , he had called the vote eleven months earlier than he had to in hopes of increasing his strength in the Diet 's 511-member lower house . But some frank talk by Ohira about higher taxes frightened voters , and the party 's representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Former Premier Takeo Miki demanded that Ohira step down as Premier and party leader , and his call was soon echoed by Fukuda , whom Ohira had ousted as Premier last December . But the Bull refused to quit , thus triggering a fierce party struggle . At first , says one L.D.P. Diet member , " we thought that it was like any fight between father and mother . It would get serious , but in the end there would be no divorce . " Yet as the days went by , all attempts at compromise proved fruitless . <P> When the Diet finally reassembled last week , it faced a situation unprecedented in Japan 's 33-year postwar parliamentary history : two candidates from the same party , Ohira and Fukuda , vying for the premiership . Elected on the second ballot by a 17-vote margin , Ohira owed his victory to the support of a conservative breakaway party , the New Liberal Club . The win did little to enhance Ohira 's stature , either in the Diet or in his own party . Fumed one L.D.P. member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should resign , but later I decided he should-not because of the election , but because he made our party look so damn foolish . " <P> Ohira named a Cabinet that reflected the deep schisms within the party . Though none of the faction chiefs personally accepted positions , Ohira was forced to pass over many of his closest allies in handing out the portfolios ; 15 of his 20 ministers are in their first Cabinet jobs . He has also agreed to give some key party positions , including the post of secretary-general , to members of rival factions . Despite these fence-mending efforts , the party 's wounds are far from healed . Vowed Fukuda : " The first round is over , but the second has just begun . "
