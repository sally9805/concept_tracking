txt President Carter fulfilled a campaign pledge last year when he submitted a sweeping welfare reform proposal to Congress . But key Democrats , like House Ways and Means Chairman Ullman and Senate Finance Chairman Long , balked at the nearly $20 billion price tag and for all practical purposes declared the controversial plan dead on arrival . Even as Representative Corman 's special subcommittee labored conscientiously on the original proposal , welfare reform was quietly stricken from Washington 's legislative priority list . Still , several Congressmen , notably Representative Ullman and Republican Senators Baker and Bellmon , persevered to devise more modest programs . All pretense of grandiose reform has vanished now , but a bill incorporating four critical ingredients of reform stands a chance ? if only Congress and the Administration can overcome the partisanship that impedes compromise on the competing Democratic and Republican plans . ? Minimum national benefit levels . Whatever new welfare law Congress passes , it should establish uniform benefit levels . Benefits now vary dramatically , from a high of $6,132 for a family of four in New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formula would raise the national minimum to $4,200 , an increase over present levels in 11 states . Welfare fathers . Any new welfare plan should also extend coverage nationally to families headed by unemployed fathers , eliminating pressure that drives families apart . At present , nearly half the states refuse such coverage . Both the Ullman and Baker-Bellmon bills would require it of all states , although to limit such coverage to 17 weeks a year , as the Ullman bill does , seems harsh . Job creation . If the cycle of welfare dependency and poverty is ever to be broken , welfare recipients must be brought into the world of work . They need training in marketable skills and jobs that offer reasonable wages and hope for the future . Baker-Bellmon is the more appealing on this score . It would provide public service jobs under CETA ( Comprehensive Employment and Training Act ) , the primary Federal job program for the poor . The Ullman plan would set a minimum-wage ceiling for such jobs ; Baker-Bellmon would pay prevailing public service wages , thus avoiding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CETA work force . More important , it would virtually guarantee a job to at least one parent in every two-parent family . Fiscal relief . Lastly , Washington must help the cities and states . Poverty  --  and migration of the poor ? is a national problem , attributable largely to forces beyond local control . Yet the costs are now shared by all levels of government . For example , New York City pays 25 percent  --  over $400 million next fiscal year ? of the aid to families with children , Mayors and governors will find Baker-Bellmon the more generous of the two measures in providing added fiscal relief . ? Like the larger original Carter plan , both hills address the most glaring deficiencies of the current welfare system . Their differences seem reconcilable . And the President , who deserves credit for trying to straighten out the " welfare mess , " can help by pushing welfare higher on his legislative agenda . In the end , substance will largely be dictated by cost . Even within the $7 to $9 billion ceiling on new expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare package that responds to pressing human needs . Ts that too much to expect of a White House and Congress controlled by Democrats , self-proclaimed chainpions of the poor ?
