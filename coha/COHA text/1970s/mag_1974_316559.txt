It is a pressagent 's dream . There are Pop Singer and Composer John Phillips , 37 , his first wife , Michelle Phillips , 29 , and his second missus , South African Actress Genevieve Waite , 26 , all making music for their " family label , " Paramour Records . No hanky-panky about it either . Although Phillips , who with Michelle , Cass Elliot , and Denny Doherty founded the Mamas and the Papas singing group in 1965 , likes to call his life-style with a giggle " a mnage trois , " the relationship seems to be purely commercial . Michelle and Genevieve are capital investments . " There 's something about me that makes women sing , " he declared from his Manhattan town house . Said Michelle at her West Coast home : " He keeps us both busy , " referring to the fact that she and Genevieve are currently cutting discs of John 's songs . Apart from that , she added , " we lead very separate lives .

Among those hurriedly delivering diamonds , rubies and emeralds to the gifts office were Betty Fulbright , wife of Senator J. William , whose Foreign Relations Committee drafted the 1966 law that does not permit officials or their families to accept gifts worth more than $50 .

Presented to Muriel Humphrey in 1968 by Zaire 's President Mobutu Sese Seko , along with ten leopard skins from a Somalia official , the diamond has been resting in a Minneapolis safe-deposit box . The skins were sold in 1970 for $7,500 , which was given to the Louise Whitbeck Fraser School for the mentally retarded in Minneapolis . Pleading ignorance of the 1966 law , Humphrey said in Washington last week : " At no time did any officer of the State Department or any other agency of Government inform me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be placed in the custody of the department .
