WHOOPEE ! <P> Book by William Anthony McGuire Music by Walter Donaldson Lyrics by Gus Kahn <P> If they survive for half a century , songs are not only classics , they are also beloved . One could sense that on the opening night of the revival of the 1928 musical Whoopee ! Just the first few bars of Makin ' Whoopee , I 'm Bringing a Red , Red Rose , Love Me or Leave Me and Yes , Sir , That 's My Baby brought forth the sound of 2,000 hands clapping . <P> The book has apparently undergone some renovation , but purists of the Broadway class of ' 28 are the only ones who are likely to be troubled by that . If the word escapist were forgotten , Whoopee ! would redefine it . The show is transparently mindless and totally exhilarating fun . Director Frank Corsaro has wisely pitched the tone of the entire evening between silent-movie comedy and balmy operantics . It is never camped . Like gentle satire , it is half in love with what it kids , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wafer thin . Henry Williams ( Charles Repole ) is slight in stature but huge in hypochondria , and so full of pills that when he sneezes " people around me get cured . " By happenstance , Henry extricates Sally Morgan , a coy maiden winsomely played by Beth Austin , from the maritally-minded clutches of Sheriff Bob ( J. Kevin Scannell ) , a sage brush Keystone Kop . Sally 's true love is Hiawatha , or rather , Wanenis ( Franc Luz ) , a noble North American savage from red-blooded Dartmouth . She gets him , and after a number of featherbrained misadventures , Henry finds perfect health and pneumatic bliss in the arms of a lusty-voiced , opulently endowed nurse ( Carol Swarbrick ) . <P> As Henry , Charles Repole moves with the erratic precision of a broken watch spring , but his tap and soft-shoe dances possess the style that Walter Mitty 's dreams are made of . He looks astonishingly like Eddie Cantor , the show 's original star , but his manner is endearingly cuddlesome , rather like Joel Grey 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like prairie fires , and the smashing chorus girls are a bouquet of red , red roses .
