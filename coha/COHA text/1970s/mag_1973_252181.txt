<P> The nation 's emotions about Richard Nixon and Watergate are almost as complex and contradictory as the testimony in the Senate . In a Gallup poll taken in the wake of John Dean 's devastating appearance , fully 71% believe that the President was involved in either the planning or the cover-up of the Watergate breakin . If Nixon was indeed involved , then he is guilty of criminal acts that would presumably be grounds for impeachment . Yet the same survey showed that only 18% think Nixon " should be compelled to leave office . " <P> Last week , in dozens of interviews across the nation , TIME correspondents explored attitudes about possible presidential involvement and what should be done if Nixon is indeed culpable . They found that there is indeed a dominant feeling that the President was involved in one way or another . Yet there is also a deep fear of the national trauma that long and messy impeachment proceedings would probably cause . <P> Tom Sullivan , a retired J.C . Penney executive in Anaheim , Calif. , was especially hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " that the whole break-in was discussed and planned with Ehrlichman and Haldeman and that Nixon approved it . But as for impeachment , I just do n't know . When other countries overthrow the government , it 's chaos . I personally think he should be watched closely for the rest of his term . " Paul B. Wynett , a Georgia advertising man , wonders : " How could all those people be doing all those things without his knowing about it ? But the best thing to do is forgive and forget . If this had to happen , I think it will enlighten people and let them know that big old red , white and blue balloon can burst . " <P> Bennett Webster , a lawyer and Republican county chairman in Iowa , may have an accurate instinct for popular sentiment : " The majority of people feel impeachment is too drastic , that the country ca n't stand it . It 's more a fear of the unknown than anything else-a deep-seated fear of a radical proceeding . " Says Thomas Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An impeachment process would disrupt the country , and we ca n't afford it . I 'm concerned about other problems in the country-the monetary crisis , the food and housing difficulties - and we need leadership . A long impeachment would leave us leaderless . " <P> U.S. Prestige . Many feel that a resignation or impeachment would irreparably damage U.S. interests in the world . Says Kurt Ogg , a Middlesex , N.J. , accountant : " I 'm sure he knew about the coverup . But resignation or forcing him out would take away from U.S. prestige abroad . " He and many others cited Nixon 's achievements in ending the war and improving relations with China and Russia . <P> Many who believe Nixon participated in the cover-up and do not think he should be impeached are fearful of an Agnew presidency . Many Democrats would not want to see Agnew inherit the presidency because that might place him in a strong position for election in 1976 . Decision Research Corp. , a New England polling organization , explains that " the seriousness of the whole idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large number of people who think the President was involved but are unwilling to advocate impeachment.
