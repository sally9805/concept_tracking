txt John D. Ehrlichman , Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs , says , " I have the best job in government . I 'm in a situation where I see the whole spectrum . It 's something different every day . It 's so interesting that , you know , it is n't hard to get up an the morning . " This is the first of two articles based on an interview with Mr. Ehrlichman . President Nixon 's right-hand man on domestic affairs has both reservations and hope when he talks of how Congress will treat Mr. Nixon in 1972 . Asked if he thinks Congress was irresponsible or just normally partisan this year , John D. Ehrlichman replied with no noticeable belligerence : " They do n't share the President 's sense of urgency about some of the problems he conceives to be very important . . . I do n't know that there 's any one reason for it . " Asked if this congressional attitude would change one way or another in the election year , Mr. Ehrlichman responded : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a presidential year , but they tell me that things tend to bog down pretty badly . " It will be interesting to see whether they get very partisan and whether they get distracted . After all , over a period of the last year , at all times , 10 percent of the Senate has been running for president . " The distractions of the presidential campaign , he predicted , are going to lead to still " fewer results " when Congress reconvenes in January . // // Minutes before in the quiet of his airy , spacious office in the west wing of the White House , Mr. Ehrlichman had expressed hope that some of the President 's major programs which have been held up  --  welfare reform , revenue sharing , and departmental reorganization ? will finally be passed in 1972 . Of the three , he rated general revenue sharing to have " the best chance now . " It will suffer " the least fatal amendment in the legislative process , " he said . " When welfare reform gets to the Senate floor it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and amendment . . . and eventually in the fall of the year it will be in conference . . .. How much it looks like HR 1 what the President submitted when it gets finished is something that I think is too soon to know . " New calls for laws Any new large presidential initiatives next year ? There will be some presidential messages going to Congress in the first several months of 1972 proposing new or amended legislation on a wide range of domestic subjects . . . . You could predict them from your observation . We have had , for instance , a significant package on the environment and we see chances to make even more gains in that field . What about new taxes ? Well , we 've just gone through a very vigorous exercise in Congress to get taxes lowered . . . . From the first day we got here the President has been advocating tax reform . Would a value-added tax a tax applies to businesses at each stage of the production process come under that heading ? As you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and no decision has been made as to when , as , and if . But it certainly offers us some distinct advantages in the direction of reform . How about Congress ? Let 's say the President does propose a value-added tax , what are the chances of getting it through Congress ? I do n't think the chances of getting any tax through Congress in the next calendar year , an election year , would be very realistic . So we would have to talk about some other Congress than we have right now , and that 's an iffy question . What about a form of property-tax relief . Would that be tax reform ? That is the way I would prefer it to be ' thought of , yes . If tax reform is a matter of shifting burdens , how do you go about it ? You have a whole warehouse of tax machinery that you could think about using . But really the exercise is deciding where the burden most equitably should lie to serve a particular need . We simply ca n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readjustment of burdens . The people are taxed heavily enough . But some people would pay more and some people would pay less ? People or corporations or institutions of some kind . Welfare commitment seen On the President 's welfare-reform program , Mr. Ehrlichman said , " The President feels that he has a commitment from the Senate to give serious attention to HR 1 as soon as they come back from the holidays . " In Mr , Ehrlichman 's judgment , the fate of the welfare program will not be decided along partisan lines , but in the context of conservative and liberal ideologies of senators . As for revenue sharing , Mr. Ehrlichman said : " The press has been declaring general revenue sharing dead regularly , and all of a sudden it has appeared alive and well . " The President called the chairman Rep. Wilbur D. Mills , chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee the other day and they ( had a conversation about revenue sharing , They agreed that the objectives of their two proposals were very similar ; that in principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be a working out of these divergencies . But both of them evidenced goodwill and the intention to cooperate in working it out so that the House Ways and Means Committee could report on some kind of a bill moving money to state and local governments in the near future . " Regarding government reorganization . Mr. Ehrlichman observed " There are two bills of four that show some promise of movement . . . . Community development is moving faster than natural resources . but we think they will both be favorably reported out of committees and begin to receive floor attention within a couple of months after Congress returns .
