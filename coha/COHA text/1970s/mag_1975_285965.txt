When Hitler 's armies marched into the Soviet Union in 1941 , the Russian people 's fight for survival inspired Sergei Prokofiev to write an opera that would embody their struggle . His hugely ambitious choice for a story : Tolstoy 's War and Peace . What he finally produced in 1943 , however , was written in an almost schizoid style-part introspective love story , part heroic showpiece-that was difficult to grasp , easy to misunderstand . Stalin 's commissars gave only grudging approval , demanded more pageantry and patriotic fervor . At his death in 1953 , the composer was still rewriting the work . He never saw it fully staged . <P> Passion and Despair . War and Peace is finally catching on . In 1973 the work was chosen to open the new Sydney Opera House . A year ago in Boston , Sarah Caldwell presided over the first U.S. staging . Last week in New York , at long last , the Bolshoi Opera unveiled the production of War and Peace that it has been performing in Moscow since 1959 .

Coming along as the fifth of six productions offered by the Bolshoi during its current American debut at the Metropolitan Opera ( TIME , July 7 ) , War and Peace reaffirmed the Bolshoi 's eminence as one of Europe 's great opera houses . <P> Prokofiev 's opera might as well have been called Peace and War . It starts well along in the Tolstoy novel , with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky on a visit to Count Rostov 's country estate , musing on the seeming emptiness of his life , then discovering Rostov 's beautiful daughter Natasha . That and the next six scenes depict , with a mixture of passion , intrigue and despair , the decadent social life of prewar Russia . The last six scenes are devoted to the French invasion of 1812 . Napoleon struts nervously ( to the accompaniment of diabolic fanfares in brass ) , while Russian Field Marshal Kutuzov praises the people and plots the invader 's doom ( " The beast will be wounded with all the strength of Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by Prokofiev and his second wife . Prokofiev was dramatizing only a series of focal points in the story that all his audiences know . In a final chorus ( " We went to battle for our fatherland " ) , the Russian people declare themselves the victors and heroes of the opera . <P> The strength of the Bolshoi 's first-night performance-from the blasting power of both chorus and orchestra to the sensitive , rich-voiced singing of Soprano Makvala Kasrashvili as Natasha and Baritone Yuri Mazurok as Andrei - lay in the company 's willingness to take War and Peace for what it is and never what it is not . It is an epic ; but unlike the heroes of Verdi or Wagner , Napoleon and Kutuzov never meet face to face , nor do we ever see Andrei suffer his fatal wound , nor can Natasha save him . But although War and Peace is no lyric drama , Prokofiev is capable of remarkably delicate touches , like the soft rasping of strings that evoke the delirium of Andrei 's death scene . <P> War and Peace will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolshoi moves on to the Kennedy Center in Washington , D.C.
