Some day , the worst thing about cancer may be the shot you get to prevent it . <P> <P> Even before this somewhat over-optimistic statement appeared in an American Cancer Society ad , researchers were working to bring that day closer . In 1969 scientists succeeded in immunizing chickens against an avian-cancer virus . Now , two German researchers have gone even further by immunizing monkeys-which are several evolutionary steps closer to man - against a virus that causes cancer in primates . Their work raises hope that eventually similar vaccines can be developed for use in humans . <P> Professor Rainer Laufs and Dr. <P> <P> Hans Steinke conducted their experiments with cotton-topped marmosets , South American monkeys that are known to develop lymphoma , a cancer of the lymphatic system , when they are exposed to two viruses of the herpes family . The researchers reported in the British journal Nature that they inoculated 42 of the animals with a vaccine made from killed herpes saimiri viruses , then exposed some of the immunized animals and controls to live , cell-free viruses . Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The immunized animals remained healthy . <P> The work of the German researchers is also significant because it shows that killed viruses ( which are far safer to use in a vaccine than live agents ) apparently can be used to stimulate the monkeys ' immune system into manufacturing antibodies against cancer viruses . <P> <P> Doctors have long suspected that viruses , submicroscopic packets of nucleic acids similar to the DNA found in chromosomes , play a role in human as well as animal cancers . Dr. Sol Spiegelman , director of the Institute of Cancer Research at New York Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and one of the world 's leading cancer virologists , points out that virus-like particles can be found in just about every human cancer . But proving that these particles cause the cancers has been more difficult . The cases against several suspect viruses have had to be dismissed for lack of scientific proof . There is largely statistical evidence against others-most notably herpes simplex Type I , responsible for cold sores , and herpes simplex Type II , which causes genital infections . Both have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case against a virus isolated recently by Drs . Robert Gallo and Robert Gallagher of the National Cancer Institute is even stronger , further proof that it is in fact a human-cancer virus is still being sought . <P> Even if it is proved that viruses cause human cancer , cautions Spiegelman , it may be years before science can develop a safe , successful vaccine against them . But identification of cancer viruses is likely to produce a payoff long before vaccines become practical . Spiegelman believes that the presence of viral particles , which are unique to each type of cancer , may provide doctors with effective methods of detecting cancer in its earliest stages-well before it can be diagnosed by X rays and more conventional methods . That development by itself could save many of the Americans who die of cancer every year .
