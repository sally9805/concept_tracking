D. and King will not talk about that . He is , however , part of a stop-qzmcq#Govern coalition . Since the vote last Thursday which stripped of 153 votes in the winner-take-all California primary , the coalition has become a symbol of old time , power politics to some backers . " It 's time that people understood that politics are politics and always will be , " King said . " I do n't apologize for that . People not in are trying to get in and when they do , they 'll be the same as we are . " King says he is not trying to stop . It amounts to that , however , because he is trying to get Humphrey nominated and elected . While praising the influx of young people to the party this year , he frets over some of the political novices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks ousting Chicago Mayor Daley was one of the most serious mistakes the forces made .

Frank King , 60 , was once a bricklayer . Now he is president of the Ohio AFL-CIO , with a million members . He is chairtakes organization find know , how , " he said . He attacked what he called " this pretended Sunday school politics . " They the forces have been doing the same thing we have and we know It . The ) only difference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will emerge from Miami Beach as ' divided as it was after the 1068 Chicago convention . He predicts , tho , that they will have a candidate who is easier to elect because televised scenes in Chicago " made the Democrats look like a bunch of mobsters . " Michael Bleicher , 36 , is chairman of the mathematics department at the University of Wisconsin at Madison . He has been working " full tilt " for a year for . He was the senator 's committee floor manager here . Sees Possible Blunders Bleicher maintains the people did not take the California vote seriously and found themselves " faced with well disciplined anti-qzmcq#Govern forces " so that " we probably made strategic blunders . " In his view , severing those 153 California votes from " made voting on the issues and on conscience " the first casualty of the committee . Having met the anti-qzmcq#Govern " juggernaut , " Bleicher admits " we overreacted . " Tho he felt Daley should be given a lesson for his cavalier attitude toward the reform guidelines , Bleicher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise to help Daley save face and to help insure ' Illinois ' votes next November . The people on the committee became " so hardened after the California vote " nothing could be done , he said .

A procedural vote on the lust full committee meeting . day indicated the Humphrey group and its allies had a strength of about 67 among the 150 corn . mittee members . Foley and his lieutenants went to work . " No Buying Votes " He believes this open process is fine . There is no ' more buying and selling of votes , he said . He has promised to support enthusiastically should he win . Foley refuses to doubt there will be unity after Miami Beach . Warren Widener , 34 , the black mayor of Berkeley , Cal. , is less optimistic . He was the chair man of the minority caucus here . " I think this Credentials Committee has polarized the Democratic Party so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach , whoever comes out of the convention wo n't be able to beat Nixon , " Widener explained . Ca n't Back Humphrey He could not support Humphrey , he said . He believes Humphrey , thru his committee supporters , has used " racist tactics , " as reflected in votes on various challenges . He called the California vote split " an outrageous kind of political stealing . " Dumping Daley was so important to Widener that even a Democratic ? loss in Illinois in November is worth it to him .
