THE COMPANY by JOHN EHRLICHMAN 313 pages . Simon &; Schuster. $8.95 . <P> " Let us begin by committing ourselves to the truth-to see it like it is , and tell it like it is-to find the truth , to speak the truth , and to live the truth . " <P> - Richard Nixon , accepting the <P> G.O.P. presidential nomination in 1968 <P> As nearly everyone in the U.S. knows , John Ehrlichman was one of President Nixon 's chief aides . Since Watergate he has avoided jail ( without benefit of pardon ) , settled in New Mexico , and is still appealing convictions on charges that range from two counts of perjury to conspiracy to obstruct justice . <P> He has also written this novel . And why not ? Even in the old days , Ehrlichman had a way with words . It was he , for instance , who came up with the phrase " modified , limited hangout , " a memorable locution , which in practice was roughly translatable as " admit as little truth as possible and try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful were the President 's men at concealing truth that despite all the reports , books and films since Watergate , Ehrlichman 's novel is sure to be grasped by his still frustrated countrymen in hopes of gathering a few more shards of information about the political hecatomb that was the Nixon White House . <P> On that account prospective buyers of The Company should beware . A Washington roman clef it is ; a full-scale Watergate book it is not . Ehrlichman is clearly using fiction as an extension of politics by other means ; but his novel ends with word that a member of the White House staff has just been caught breaking into the headquarters of a Democratic candidate . The Company , in fact , bears the same relation to the final drama of Watergate that successive Shakespearean history plays bear to one another . There is some overlap . Dark deeds and blood feuds of the past rise up to haunt or thwart the heir apparent , whether he be Richard III of York , or Richard I of Whittier , Calif . <P> Pluperfect Egomaniac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CIA , a political genie that Congress is even now trying to stuff back into some sort of legislative bottle . As the book develops , dynastic rivalries between Presidents and parties are less fierce than continuing an almost mortal combat between the White House and the CIA . The dark deed that makes the plot boil , in fact , is a political murder , secretly ordered by Democratic President William Arthur Curry and carried out by the CIA on a Latin American beachhead ( here called Rio de Muerte ) easily identifiable as the Bay of Pigs . <P> President Curry , described as a rich man 's son , a Yaleman and a " handsome weakling , " dies before completing his term . His Democratic successor makes William Martin , the CIA agent who saw to the murder , boss of The Company . Why ? Because the new President is aware of the secret order and of Martin 's guilt . Armed with that knowledge , he tries to indulge in a little friendly blackmail to get CIA files for use in the next election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a vast , salty-tongued , womanizing hick and a " pluperfect egomaniac " who dotes on the appointments of the presidential plane . ( Even the candy wrappers aboard , Ehrlichman writes , come emblazoned with the words Air Force One. )
