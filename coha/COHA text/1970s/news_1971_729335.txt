txt You see him on television frequently aid he often appears in newspipers being quoted as the mid spokesman for President ' Dixon . He Is Herbert G. Klein , director of communications for tie executive branch , a unique government position that almost defies a job description . One day he will be briefing senior editors and publishers of major newspapers , that night he might be appearing on the Dick Cavett show , or talking over the telephone to the President or at an airport chatting with a reporter fresh out of journalism school . Top of Empire A f or m e r newspaper reporter , editor and copy boy at $12.50 per week , Klein today sits at the top of the federal establishment 's vast public relations and information empire . It is an empire so big that it is difficult for Klein , or even the bureau of the budget , to accurately pinpoint the number of people or amount of money involved . And because it has been built by many people over many year s , it is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When we started cutting back at the President 's direction , " Klein said , " we found many strange publications and duplications of effort . Hut we have gotten perhaps $40. million out of the total budget so far . " Cutting Is Complicated The cutting is almost as complicated as Klein 's job because much of the executive branch public relations effort is run by career civil service employes , most of whom were hired in previous administra. tions . Members of the Republican National Committee are still unhappy , for example , because the t o p government press policy posts at defense and state are held by holdovers from the Johnson administra- . It has been Klein 's style , however , to delegate duties and try to avoid being labled a " czar " in calling the shots on all of the huge amounts of information that flow from the executive branch . Outside Status Quo His assignment has been to broaden the President 's lines of communication with the nation , an assignment which has taken him and the President more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are appearing at frequent intervals before top media executives i n cities around the United States , as is Vice President Agnew . Neither Klein nor his staff of 22 persons has kept a statistical chart of his own appearances , but a review of his schedule for a year 's period shows him averaging at least one press conference or speech per day in a different city . Another of the reasons for both the President and Klein getting out of Washington is simply to find out first-hand what people in all sectors of the nation are thinking  --  and doing . Get Other View " We feel that it is very important to get something other than the ' Washington ' view , " Klein said . An observation by a correspondent who has traveled with Klein is that he may get as much information on his field trips as he gives out . Much of it goes back to the President or to the appropriate government agency . A frequent question for Klein concerns the credibility of the administration . " You 're never going to eliminate all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview , " because this is an age where there 's a great deal of cynicism . . . . I think that people are tired of the war , and they 've lost a lot of confidence in what 's been going on . " In Wichita , he told members of the Kansas Press Association he wils shocked that some people give more credibility to underground newspapers than to those in metropolitan areas because the press in the United States is the best the world has ever known . " A free press , " he said , " is essential to this country and we must work for it , both in and out of government . " He reminded the ed it o r s that credibility is also a responsibility of the press . Entitled to Views While reporters are entitled to their own views , Klein suggested it might be the better part of good journalism for them to keep their " frustrations out of the tone and form of questions , " as well as out of their copy . Klein conceded that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm . But he believes there has been less attempt to control the flow  --  and Is innocent of charges leveled in other administrations that news was " managed . " He said Nixon has never , as President , " chewed " a reporter for a critical story and is not nearly as sensitive today to media barbs as he was while a member of Congress or as Vice President . And while the President is " a reader of newspapers , " Klein notes that the old practice of reacting to news reports when Lyndon B. Johnson was President have been sharply changed in this administration . One of the first acts of Nixon upon entering office was to remove the customized cabinet containing the three color TV sets Johnson used to monitor the three major news shows at the same time . Klein now has the sets in his office and his staff monitors the shows  --  preparing a digest of what is said and presenting it to the President the next morning inside a black note book . Digest Is No Shield A sampling of news stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed to about 12 other people who work for the President . Klein says the digest does not shield the President from criticism . " I believe we have overcome this by giving him the pros and cons of an issue , " Klein said . While Klein himself is somewhat shielded in Washington because of the demands of the communications operation , he runs out of dimes on trips buying local newspapers  --  and calling local newsmen while changing planes at airports . In addition , his staff and other departments prep a r e position and subject reports on government activities that Klein reads on a daily basis or before speaking to local groups . Prepare Other Reports Klein has traveled more than a million miles in behalf of Nixon since he first met him while working as a reporter on the Alhambra Cal . Post Advocate 25 years ago . Both are natives of California , served in the Navy , and generally have shared similar political views during their association . The communication director 's office is filled from wall-to-wall with pictures of that association ? plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klein 's aspirations are not on the public record , but It appears certain he will continue with the President as long as he is needed .
