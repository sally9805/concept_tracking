There was little cheer as TIME 'S Board of Economists met last week to analyze President Ford 's proposals and assess prospects of the U.S. economy for the year ahead . All but one of the nine board members agreed without doubt that the nation is in recession , with little hope for recovery before late next year . Walter W. Heller of the University of Minnesota , a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers , went further than most , yet few disagreed with the thrust of his thinking : " We are driving this economy into very deep recession-the worst since the Great Depression . " <P> To most of the economists , the Ford Administration 's economic program offered little uplift . In general , they applauded Ford 's recommendations for , among other things , increasing investment capital and food supplies . But the majority dismissed the program as no more than a tiny first step at best , lacking force to arrest inflation , curb unemployment , stimulate growth and promote recovery . David L. Grove , chief economist of IBM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the oldtime religion with special dispensation for the poor . " <P> Beryl W. Sprinkel , a monetarist and fiscal conservative who is senior vice president of Chicago 's Harris Trust and Savings Bank , was the board 's strongest supporter of the Administration 's current economic plan . He praised Ford 's avoidance of controls and stress on spending prudence . Sprinkel was echoed by Murray Weidenbaum , former Assistant U.S. Treasury Secretary and now a professor at Washington University in St. Louis , who is the board 's newest member . Republican Weidenbaum favored Ford 's proposals to stimulate investment and eliminate regulatory laws that increase prices , yet he regarded the WIN button campaign as juvenile hoopla and jested that the next logical step would be " pom-pom girls and cheerleaders . " <P> Though Sprinkel alone took exception to the majority 's view that the U.S. is in recession , he agrees that current conditions almost certainly point to a recession by next year . <P> But for now , he feels , they are not comparable to the five recessions since World War II . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals , aluminum-are pulsing along at capacity not encouraging :
