txt WASHINGTON ** a move that could complicate the sale of Budget Director Bert Lance 's stock in the National Bank of Georgia , the Federal Reserve Board Sunday placed the bank on a margin list limiting the loan value of its stocks . The action also could nave an impact on the $3.4 million loan Lance got seven months ago from the First National Bank of Chicago . When the Federal Reserve Board puts a bank on the margin list , that means that the bank 's stock , when used as collateral , is limited to 50 per cent of its market value . When a bank Is not on the margin list , no limit is placed on the value of the stock for collateral purposes . LANCE , FORMER PRESIDENT of the Georgia bank , has said he used 200 , - 000 shares of its stock and other unidentified assets as collateral to secure the loan from the Chicago bank . Being put on the margin list often means only that the bank 's stock is becoming actively traded , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings , which the Georgia bank has suffered , or in anticipation of a large stock trade .

Before the margin requirement was put Into effect , a buyer could have used his own credit rating for a maximum loan to buy Lance 's stock . But under the margin listing , anyone who buys the stock must put up 50 per cent of the asking price in cash , Rakes said . A brokerage source also said that the new listing would complicate the sale , because any buyer would have to meet the asking price by mortgaging other assets . But ho said the listing actually could help the sale because once a bank is on the margin list , that indicates its stock is becorinng more prominent . LANCE OWNS MORE THAN 20 per cent of the Georgia bank 's stock , anti although no total dollar value has been put on his shares , Lance 's trustee has said it will bo substantially above tho current market value price of $12 a share and probably near the $17 Lance originally paid for it .
