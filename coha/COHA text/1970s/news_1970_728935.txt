txt deleted 8 lines major national issue that some militants predicted last spring it would be , it has clearly emerged as a new and possibly portentous fixture of the political landscape . A wide variety of ecological problems are subjects of lively campaign debate and public concern in at least half of the 50 states . In some situations , the issues could be decisive . The Issues range from water pollution in Hawaii to farmtrash burning in Oregon , stripmining in Tennessee and oil slicks in Maine . Much of the debate revolves around candidates ' voting records on matters ranging from national parks to provincial conservation laws . In 19 states some 28 candidates , mostly at the Congressional level , have been earwho have not felt compelled to pay at least lip service to environmental reform . But in about half the states , political people either do not see the problems as debatable or are wary of tangling with them , and classify them in the category of " motherhood and apple pie , " In many parts of the South , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been settled in pri-1 maries and the November voting is just a formality . Some Vignettes The environmental ferment ' has produced some picturesque vignettes : Former Supreme Court Justice Arthur J. Goldberg , a gubernatorial candidate in New York , trekking to the Adirondacks to dramatize identification with conservation ) . .. In Delaware , a scion of a DuPont chemical dynasty running for Congress and criticizing the family company 's water pollution . . . In Indiana , a judicial candidate , who admittedly would be able to strike few blows from the bench , nevertheless punctuating his campaign with a 250-mile environmental hike . In several states , rival candidates have dramatically foresworn the use of billboards as " scenic pollution " ? an altruistic gesture that has the dual effect of saving them money . A gallup poll In August showed air and water pollution among the top five " national problems " in public political concern . Vietnam was named by 24 per cent of the respondents as the No. 1 problem ; campus unrest by 17 per cent ; inflation by 14 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution by 10 per cent . Pollution ranked ahead of racial problems , crime and drugs . Much of the current political activism can be traced to the national Earth Day observances of last April 22 , when the potentialities of the ballot box were urged on discontented citizens . But the widely known conservation organizations , such as the Sierra Club , the National Audubon Society and the Izaak Walton League , can figure only obliquely in the election . They can disseminate information , but their tax-free " educational " status precludes direct action in behalf of candidates . In Minnesota an array of environmental problems and arguments about how they should he dealt with dominate the gubernatorial contest between Attorney General Douglas Head , a Republican , and State SenatorWendell Anderson , of the Democrat-Farmer-Labor party . Problems in Minnesota The problems include the Reserve Mining Company 's dumping of pollutants into Lake Superior , United States Steel 's air pollution of Duluth , radiation restrictions on a new atomic power plant , and management of agricultural waste . In Tennessee , Senator Albert Gore , a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blaming them for " despoiling our clean water , fresh air and beautiful scenery , " and asserting that " my opponent favors these corporate giants . " His opponent , Representative E. Brock 3d , has countered with a proposal that money released from Vietnam go into a " human renewal funds " to fight pollution . A parallel battle is under way in Utah , Senator Frank Moss , a Democrat , a leading Congressional conservationist , is being challenged by Representative Laurence Burton , a Republican whom Senator Moss accuses of " opposing clean air under Johnson and supporting it under Nixon . " Senator Moss 's campaign television spots show him talking with his little granddaughter beside a stream , and with groups of young people against backgrounds of various Federal preserves in the state , telling how he sponsored the hills for them . Mr. Burton 's television spots show him punching cattle , an identification with stockmen who oppose the sealing off ' of Federal park lands . The two national organizations most active on environmental issues are the League of Conservation . Voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Environmental Action , the young people 's group that organized Earth Day . Both organizations are based in Washington . The league is supporting 16 candidates in 12 states with funds and campaign volunteers . It has branches in several states . So far it has distributed $25,000 , most of which came from $5 and $10 contributions solicited by mail . The league had a substantial part in the Maryland Democratic primary victory of Paul Sarbanes , a state legislator , over Representative George Fallon , a 13-term Congressional veteran who has been chairman of the House Public Works Committee and - who was criticized as having a deplorable anti-conservation record . Another league endorsee , Philip , Hoff , won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in Vermont . Two league-backed candidates for state legislative seats won in Florida and California primaries . Two other candidates with league support , Texas 's Senator Ralph W. Yarborough and California 's Representative George Brown , both Democrats , were beaten in primaries . Environmental action listed a " Dirty Dozen " incumbent House members from nine states ? 10 Republicans and two Democrats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both conservation and other issues . One was Mr. Fallon . Another was Representative Byron G. Rogers , a Democrat who was eliminated in the Colorado primary . The Negative View The negative view of environmental politics was expressed by Frank Denholm , a Democratic Congressional candidate in South Dakota . " Pollution is not an issue with me until I find someone who is for it , " he said . " Then it will become an issue . " And Richard Gebhardt , a Democratic congressional candidate in Colorado , said : " I find very few people who raise questions about environment . It 's a rhetoric issue , unfortunately . It ought not to be . " Some of the other states lacking environmental fireworks include Iowa , Kansas , Oklahoma , Massachusetts , Missouri and West Virginia . But such areas , if anything , were in the minority . In Delaware , Pierre S. DuPont 4th , a candidate for the House , said : " Environmental questions are extremely important in the campaign . The feeling is that , penalties against corporate polluters are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental standards are not : tough enough , with which I agree , and that much more em-I phasis must be given to enforcement procedures . Referring to the E. I. duPont de Nemours Company 's payment this month of a $2,500 fine in one water pollution case and $500 in another , Mr. duPont commented : " That 's absurd . Under Delaware law it 's $500 a day . If we 're going to nave meaningful penalties . they ought to be $5,000 or $10,000 a day , at the judge 's discretion . " In general , the indications are that this election marks just the icebreaker in the environment 's role in practical politics . " Nobody 's going to take a stupid side of the issue in the campaign , " State Senator Pierre Pelham of Alabama said . " Pollution is the sort of political issue where you do n't have a ' confrontation until you start legislating . " And a party professional In California predicted that environmentalists ' scrutiny of legislators ' activities " by 1972 is going to have real effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
