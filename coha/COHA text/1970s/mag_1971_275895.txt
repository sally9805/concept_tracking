What is the greatest threat to the survival of young Americans ? The war in Viet Nam ? Drugs ? VD ? Malnutrition ? The correct answer , says Psychologist Leon Goldstein of the National Transportation Safety Board , is riding in an automobile . A Safety Board study reveals that youths are especially likely to have fatal car accidents between the ages of 16 and 19 and while driving at night , when driving conditions are most hazardous . Goldstein said he also was " astonished " to discover that " measurable alcohol " had been a contributing factor in up to 60% of auto deaths involving youths between 16 and 24 . That means at least one-tenth of 1% alcoholic content in the driver 's blood-the equivalent for a 160-Ib. male of five shots of 100-proof whisky guzzled on an empty stomach within an hour .
