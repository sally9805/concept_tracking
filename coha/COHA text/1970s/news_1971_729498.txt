txt The United States pharmaceutical industry bears a major responsibility for the drug-abuse problem in the United States , says Richard A. Callahan , recently named executive officer of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs . The reason , he says , is unlimited production of legal drugs that are often abused . He refers specifically to amphetamines , a class of stimulants . " Many doctors are also careless and indifferent in the way they dispense these drugs , but my major quarrel is with the manufacturers , " Mr. Callahan said . " With a new federal law just taking effect , and an administrative change within the new law , we should be able to get a handle on this problem , " he said in an interview here . At present director of the New England regional office of the Bureau of Narcotics , Mr. Callahan leaves for his new post in Washington sometime this summer . He will work directly under John E. Ingersoll , director of the bureau . The new law , the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single and comprehensive law to control all types of drugs with a potential for abuse . Production quota involved Title II , called the controlled-substances act , is the new legal basis for federal control of drugs in the U.S The administrative change **35;538;TOOLONG hand in controlling amphetamines involves a production quota . As required by law , Attorney General John N. Mitchell had published in the Federal Register of May 26 a statement that transfers amphetamines from Schedule 3 to Schedule 2 of the 1970 law . On June 26 , a month after publication of the announcement , and with the approval of the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare , the Attorney General can set a fixed production ceiling- on amphetamines. // *U.S. drug firms rapped on pep pills // Exact production figures are still being hammered out . One of the complications has been the nation 's antitrust laws , designed to encourage competition and discourage restraints on trade . This conflict has been resolved in the past . In the case of opiates , for example , domestic production is already tightly controlled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. have been alarmed for some time about the immense uncontrolled production of amphetamines by U.S. pharmaceutical firms , which produce the drugs cheaper than anywhere else in the world . These firms , as well as supplying the U.S. market , do a large export business , Great Britain included . In 1970 alone well over 3.5 billion individual dosage units of amphetamines were ? produced-m-the U.S. , .. according to statistics from drug firms . Stockpiles could be well over that amount Figures on actual usage are nearly impossible to come by . Some say that more than 5 billion individual doses of emphetamines are made a year . Reps . Cornelius E. Gallagher ( D ) of New Jersey and Claude Pepper ( D ) of Florida estimate that half of all amphetamines produced wind up in illegal channels . Production of methamphetamme last year reached more than 1.2 billion doses . The new law will be a strong tool in controlling drug abuse , Mr. Callahan says . " Industry , " he observes , " will say , ' But now that you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain a strong foothold . ' " But we 'd like to see even tougher laws ? we see the results these drugs have on people . " Amphetamines are prescribed largely for overweight . Some people in the drug field estimate that as many as 90 percent of all prescribed amphetamines are used for weight reduction . Strict records required With amphetamines listed as a controlled ? substance. , all manufacturers , wholesalers , retailers ( pharmacists ) , as well as doctors involved with this class of drug must keep strict records of their production , sales , and dispensation . This makes auditing of the drug by federal officials a more practical matter . Recently , Mr. Callahan said , agents in his New England Bureau audited a doctor and found he had more than 2 million doses of the drug . The doctor specialized in weight control . " And he has a lot of slim women under prescription , " adds Mr. Callahan . He also cited an instance of a doctor " who was almost broke two years ago , but who now grosses over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through deceit " But I 'm still primarily concerned with production . That 's where we can really cut into the abuses . Andthere are still a lot of fly-by-night drug firms , along with some who are more responsible " GIs in Vietnam , Mr. Callahan said , " ar addicted to heroin by criminals who to them the drug they are buying is only stimulant . They smoke it or sniff it an become addicted to the hardest dru known . " But drug abuse in the military must b kept in perspective , he said . " The militar is the last institution to be hit , showing had the most discipline , " he pointed ou " And on top of that , the war is largel wound down and Saigon is full of GIs wit little or nothing to do .
