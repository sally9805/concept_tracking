Sometimes I think this whole world <P> is one big prison yard Some of us are prisoners , the rest <P> of us are guards Lord Lord , so they cut George <P> Jackson down Lord Lord , they laid him in the <P> ground . <P> <P> - Bob Dylan <P> The buff-colored civic-center modern Santa Clara County Superior Courthouse , where the trial of Angela Davis is being held , is protected by a couple of recently erected 12-ft. chain-link fences , with gates guarded by about a dozen armed deputies . At 6 each morning , quiet , well-behaved crowds of young blacks , Chicanos and whites begin gathering at the gates to vie for the 42 courtroom seats reserved for the public . Angela Davis , her sister Fania Jordan and the defendant 's team of three lawyers arrive shortly before 9 , from a secret place where Miss Davis has been staying since her release on $102,500 bail Feb. 16 . Everyone must pass through a detection device so sensitive that it picked up the metal in a woman reporter 's girdle . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but unobtrusive . The area in front of Judge Richard E. Arnason 's bench is clogged with tables and people . At one table Prosecutor Albert W. Harris Jr . sits with an assistant . The rest of the limited space is filled by half a dozen deputies with walkie-talkies and a bailiff-all armed with revolvers . In the first rows sit 30 members of the press contingent , which includes correspondents from the Soviet Union and East Germany , where Angela Davis is considered a political prisoner . <P> <P> In his opening statement , Prosecutor Harris had to go back over the events that led to the Davis trial . In January 1970 , George Jackson and two other blacks , Fleeta Drumgo and John Clutchette , were charged with the murder of John Mills , a guard at the state prison in Soledad , Calif . Jackson had already spent ten years in prison for a $70 robbery ; there he turned into a skillful revolutionary dialectician and a leader of Soledad 's militant black inmates . The 1970 indictments made him a radical hero , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 1970 , Jackson 's younger brother Jonathan , 17 , tried to kidnap a judge and four others from the Marin County , Calif. , courthouse . He reportedly said that he meant to use his hostages to bargain for release of the Soledad Brothers . In the shootout that followed , the judge , young Jackson and two of his accomplices were killed . About a year later , George Jackson , then 30 , was fatally shot at San Quentin in what prison authorities called an escape attempt . Last week , ironically , Drumgo , 26 , and Clutchette , 29 , were acquitted of the Soledad guard 's murder by an all-white jury in San Francisco . Now , Angela Davis , 28 , the former U.C.L.A. philosophy instructor and proclaimed Communist , was on trial for murder , kidnaping and criminal conspiracy in supposedly helping Jonathan in the fatal attempt to free his brother . She did so , said Prosecutor Harris , because of her " passion for George Jackson that knew no bounds . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
