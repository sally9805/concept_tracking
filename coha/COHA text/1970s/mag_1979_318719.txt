BLOOMSBURY : A HOUSE OF LIONS by Leon Edel <P> Lippincott ; 288 pages ; $12.95 <P> Only two kinds of books seem to be published nowadays : those that are about Bloomsbury and those that are not . Every survivor of that glittering artistic and intellectual cabal , every survivor 's survivor , has given testimony . Leon Edel is one of our leading literary biographers , the author of the magisterial five-volume Henry James . But what can even he add to the existing mountain of data ? Only two characteristic Bloomsbury virtues : form and sensibility . <P> The " Bloomsberries , " as they were dubbed , were born into well-connected families and came of age during England 's long Edwardian afternoon . Most of them met at Cambridge , then gravitated to the squares of London 's Bloomsbury district . Although their communal spirit was strong , their gossipy , party-filled life was a kaleidoscope of shifting alliances - aesthetic , social and sexual . <P> At one point Biographer Lytton Strachey wrote to Economist Maynard Keynes of his " adoration " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make Grant his lover . Grant later lived with Painter Vanessa Bell ; when she bore their child , the happy event was cheered not only by Keynes but by Vanessa 's absentee husband , Art Critic Clive Bell , and her former lover , Critic-Painter Roger Fry . <P> Edel uses a novelist 's skill to keep all this straight - if straight is the word . Strachey 's Eminent Victorians , he notes , was written " in a new kind of ink - the ink of Vienna , of Sigmund Freud . " Edel 's portrait of Virginia Woolf includes a pow erful analysis of the roots of her art and madness . She was haunted by deaths in her family ( symbolized by a horrible animal face that once appeared when she looked in a mirror ) and sexually traumatized by her halfbrothers ' childhood groping . At the same time , her identification with her dead father and brother , and her rivalry with her sister Vanessa , alternately undermined and reinforced her will to live . This was " the circular dance of Virginia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplifies nor obfuscates . He has that rarest of traits among psychological interpreters : tact . <P> Ultimately , this is less the biography of people than the fever chart of an ideal . The Bloomsberries aspired to a spiritual bohemianism that would throw off Victorian customs and morals . They shaded 19th century liberalism into a reformers ' zeal for the good , the beautiful and the outspoken . In literature they allied themselves with the experimental ; in art they coined the term post-impressionist and introduced the English public to Cezanne , Van Gogh , Matisse and Picasso . <P> Yet the Bloomsberries ' influence in publishing , journalism and the arts struck some observers as malign , a means of thwarting outsiders and puffing their own productions . In sanctifying personal relations and sexual freedom , they risked seeming ingrown and self-indulgent . D.H . <P> Lawrence likened them to beetles , a " hor ror of little swarming selves .
