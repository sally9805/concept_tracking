Billing earlier , paying later <P> While OMB 's Director was under fire , two other officials of the agency were being praised by the White House last week for some ideas that they figure will save $125 million a year . <P> The ideas grew out of a conversation over a couple of Margaritas ten months ago . Wayne Granquist , 42 , OMB 's associate director , was trying to talk his old friend Dick Cavanagh , 31 , into leaving a consulting job at McKinsey &; Co. and joining Government . What precisely would Cavanagh do ? Granquist had a simple but dramatic way of showing him . Check your personal records , he told Cavanagh , and see how long it took the Internal Revenue Service to cash your quarterly income tax check . Cavanagh discovered to his astonishment that it had taken 22 days . Granquist had made his point , and soon after that Cavanagh joined him at OMB with a clear mission : help the Government recoup some of the many millions of dollars it wastes annually through sloppy cash management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : during the first half of 1976 it shelled out $118 million in interest on money borrowed to make the quick payments . At the same time , the U.S. dawdles in collecting money owed to it . Customarily , the Government takes 23 days to send bills to buyers of goods from the nation 's strategic stockpile , and nine days to cash the buyers ' checks . <P> Cavanagh and Granquist , who is a former Norwalk , Conn. , bank president , have moved quickly to improve these costly methods . Their biggest accomplishment so far : putting to work some $1.5 billion in taxpayers ' money that was deposited without interest in banks around the country ; on July 1 , the U.S. will begin receiving $75 million interest annually on that cash . Other savings come mainly from cleaning up administrative procedures , speeding collections and controlling payouts . <P> On sales abroad-of weapons and uranium , for example-the U.S. will gain $3.5 million a year in interest by getting paid not by bank checks but by speedy transfer of funds via computers . By speeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government will save $1 million in interest a year . <P> Cavanagh and Granquist have the blessing of President Carter ; on one of their progress reports , he scribbled , " Keep it up ! " The streamliners are not doing anything that would be unusual in private business . Says Cavanagh : " These are very standard procedures . The Government should manage its money as well as the taxpayers do . "
