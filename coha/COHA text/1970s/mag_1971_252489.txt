The suburbs burgeon while America 's central cities decay , and no one has yet devised a solution to the complex of economic , racial and environmental issues involved . Last week a group of Detroit planners unveiled a radical attempt at an answer : a symbiotic linking of the center city with new towns in the suburbs . The plan , which was developed by the Metropolitan Fund of Detroit , a nonprofit research corporation in Southeast Michigan working with a $100,000 appropriation , envisions the pairing off of nine redeveloped inner-city areas with ten undeveloped suburban locations . Though each pair of sites would be geographically separate , from 20 to 40 miles apart , they would exist as political , social and economic entities . The pairs would be connected by mass transit lines and bus services ; housing would be built in both places to attract various income levels . <P> The city locations would range from 635 to 2,000 acres , accommodate 25,000 people and strive for the kind of cosmopolitan atmosphere that once made the city an attraction for middle-class whites . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would house 75,000 people , with generous green space and good low-rent housing . <P> The plan is essentially a compromise between city residents unwilling to see money spent solely for suburbia and suburbanites cool to helping foot the bill for city urban renewal . It will take 20 years to complete , and the price tag will be $1 billion in public and private funds for each paired town . But Dr. Hubert Locke , the project 's director and an associate at the Urban Studies Center at Wayne State University , thinks the plan is worth the money . <P> " Pairing the two sites will give the city a stake in development of new communities outside the city , " said Locke . " We 're trying to develop a new lifestyle to overcome social problems . This entire region will stand or fall together . Today , there are people living in a sea of social and economic decay while affluence blooms around them . If the present situation continues , the city will be dead in ten years , and the suburbs will go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers some promising relief from the growing troubles of the nation 's cities . Last week David Rockefeller , chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank , urged that a federal agency and a private corporation be created to develop 110 new towns and cities . The aim is to create a series of racially integrated complexes of villages similar to that of Columbia , Md. , a community that Chase helped develop . Under the plan , the corporation would raise a minimum of $10 billion in seed money to finance the communities , and the agency would acquire the land . The two agencies , Rockefeller said , " could create a whole series of new independent communities , providing adequate housing at reasonable cost , and bring together both the white- and blue-collar work force for industrial expansion .
