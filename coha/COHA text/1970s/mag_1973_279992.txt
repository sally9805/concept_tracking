One of the larger headlines in the Boston Chronicle of July 25 , 1768 read : STRAYED . The copy beneath told of a lost " small red &; white spotted cow " ; the owner offered a reward of $2 . Another item , headlined PROVIDENCE , told of that town 's dedication of a " Great Elm Tree " to serve as its symbolic " Tree of Liberty . " While digesting these and other colonial bulletins , a visitor to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington can wander backward or forward in American journalism to examine , say , the first regularly published newspaper in America ( Boston News-Letter , 1704 ) , or see news photos of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1937 crash of the Hindenburg . <P> These are among the ingredients of the Henry R. Luce Hall of News Reporting , which opens in the Smithsonian 's Museum of History and Technology this week . The permanent exhibit , named for the co-founder of TIME and jointly financed by Time Inc. and the Smithsonian , aims at presenting a kinetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalism may seem to be the most ephemeral of trades , dealing with instants perpetually displaced by fresher news , the exhibit shows that the industry has a complex and fascinating history . <P> Smithsonian Curator Peter Marzio has arrayed a compact but thorough review of 284 years of American journalism . The growth of newspapers , from gossipy 17th century village broadsides written by hand to today 's metropolitan dailies is reflected by changing technology : the telegraph , steam engine ( which transformed hand-operated printing presses ) , wireless , camera , typewriter . <P> Daily newsreels are shown in a small theater whose entrance has been reconstructed from fragments of Trans-Lux newsreel theaters in New York and Washington ; during the opening weeks , films from the ' 30s will feature clips of Hitler addressing his countrymen . Vintage radio sets play actual news broadcasts ; H.V. Kaltenborn 's reports from London crackle from a 1939 RCA portable . Similarly , major television news stories are rebroadcast , ranging in time from celebrations of the conquest of Japan to the conquest of the moon . Once each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be demonstrated , allowing visitors to view themselves on the same video monitors that picked up Neil Armstrong 's first step on the moon . <P> No exhibit on journalism would be complete without the Teletype machines that clack out the latest events in news offices around the world . At the Luce Hall , visitors can not only monitor incoming bulletins ; they are also invited to take home samples of the wire-service copy that will appear under tomorrow 's headlines .
