LAST NOVEMBER , the Joint Chiefs of Staff publicly ex-pressed their doubts about the ability of the All-Volunteer Force to supply enough men for a war . Gen. David Jones , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs , suggested not a return to the draft but a revival of the registration system so that men could be drafted if needed in a crisis . The debate continues . It has revolved about two questions : whether the volunteer army , begun in 1973 , has worked , and , if not , then whether a draft is the best way to fill our military needs . The volunteer army was a calculated response to the draft 's unpopularity at the end of the Vietnam war , and in an ironic sense it has worked . No one today is being drafted and no one is complaining . The standard for an army , however , is presumably not whether society is soothed by its composition , but how well it can defend the nation . The immediate , practical question ought to he just that ? does the All-Volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will it be able to do so in the future ? The answer is no . The evidence in support of this is demographic . Since the All-Volunteer Force began ; the number of men in the prime recruiting group , aged eighteen to twenty-four , has risen steadily . During that same period , active-duty strength dropped to its current level of 2.05 million ? roughly 20 percent short of the 2.5-million level envisioned by the 1970 report of the Presidents Commission on an All-Volunteer Force . To avoid embarrass-. ment over the military 's failure to attract enlistments , the Pentagon has simply lowered yearly goals . This maneuver is also desirable because it produces instant budget reductions instead of the savings from elimination of weapons or bases , whose defenders are Congressmen ever-conscious of reelection . The point is that while in recent years troop strength fell as the group of right-aged men expanded , that pool of potential soldiers will begin shrinking by 1981 . According to census predictions , it should drop some 20 percent by the mid-1990s , th us leaving the country with several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue its decline , which will surely accelerate as the population of the eighteen-to-twenty-four age group decreases . Such a policy would be disastrous . Inferiority of conventional forces in a European crisis might encourage capitulation or , as a Iasi resort , the use of nuclear weapons . There is no longer time , once a European war has begun , to draft , train , and send men to fight . So far , no one has seriously proposed allowing force levels to contract with the population . That leaves several choices : either a return to the draft or some kind of national service obligation , or a change of incentives to attract more recruits . It would he a while , however , before a change of incentives could ease the army 's immediate manpower problem ? a severe shortage of soldiers in the reserves . W HEN THE VIETNAM WAR and the draft ended , reserve duty lost its appeal . The Army Reserve and National Guard need 150,000 men . The Individual Ready Reserve , the immediate source of replacements for combat losses , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting with original front-line troops . As weapons become more terrible , troop replacements are indispensable . The growing number of American military dependents in Europe is an additional threat to fighting capability . When the military switched from drafting men for two years of active duty to offering volunteers competitive pay and three-year enlistments with career inducements , it also offered stability , which allowed volunteers to marry and start families . There are now 293,000 military dependents in Europe , most of whom live in Germany ? the likely starting place of any large-scale conventional war . The necessity of evacuating dependents might hinder the army 's resistance to sudden attack , and the possibility that evacuation could be accomplished in a week is remote . A single week , however , is often mentioned as the span of time within which the Soviet military expects to reach northern France . Plans are just plans . but highly mobile armies and devastating weapons would make the Seth Grapsey is on the staff of Fortune magazine . decisive period of action in a European war short indeed . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or prepare an assault by increasing supplies and troops at forward positions , the presence of American military dependents would complicate the strategic and military response . Withdrawing dependents might appear as a prelude to war and hence invite attack . Allowing families to remain would expose them to danger and preclude effective resistance to the actual attack . T HE VOLUNTEER ARMY 'S inability to find enough recruits . its shortage of reserves , and its excess of dependents all evolve from the switch to a paid volunteer force . Its other shortcomings have less direct impact on combat preparedness , although they are considerable and point to the fact that the military , particularly the army , is less and less representative of the society it is charged to defend . Education levels and racial composition show the white middle class increasingly reluctant to bear arms- Among military branches the army was the draft 's neediest beneficiary . Its proportion of enlistments with high-school diplomas has declined since the pre-Vietnam period , while the percentage of male high-school graduates in the general population has increased . During the volunteer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 40 percent of the army 's male entrants did not have high-school diplomas , while that figure stood at 23 percent for the nineteen-to-twenty age group nationwide in 1977 . Army figures for male entrants with some college education show greater disparities . Before the Vietnam buildup , roughly 15 percent of draftees and enlistees had attended college . The volunteer army has been getting about 5 percent . Blacks and Hispanics join the army at more than twice their level in the overall population . Their current representation among army enlistments is about 40 percent . What the statistics show is that minorities , the poor , and the uneducated ? mercenaries for the middle class ? are serving in the volunteer army far in excess of their ratio to the national population . The Senate Committee on Armed Servicesdecided that in contrast to nationwide family incomes , " the Army and Marine Corps draw more heavily from lower-income groups . " All this has practical results . Many junior-level army officers believe that intelligence levels have slipped since the All-Volunteer Force began . It is a matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service high-technology weapons . A more quantifiable index of trouble is the volunteer army 's attrition rate . Unlike those who were drafted , one who now voluntarily joins the army may , if displeased , leave . At present . 40 percent of volunteers do not complete their first term of enlistment . These brief encounters are costly and quite contrary to expectations that the volunteer army would outperform the draft in providing a stable force . More important . the continual turnover is had for the unity and spirit on which a good combat unit depends . ' Army figures show that a larger percentage of high-school graduates would cut attrition . Presumably , desertion rates , twice what the military experienced just before the Vietnam war , would also slacken if more enlisted men had the middle-class characteristics a high-school diploma represents . The All-Volunteer Force wants to recruit such people and more college graduates as well . Bigger salaries is a solution offered by members of the 1970 President 's Commission on an All-Volunteer Force who have lately defended the present system . Milton Friedman , extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force works extremely well . William Meekling , former executive director of the President 's Commission , believes the draft is a form of taxation that is unfair because it discriminates against the young . Both agree that insofar as problems exist in the volunteer army , they can and ought to be solved by economic ad- . . pistments . The notion of raising sala- ? England and Canada are the only other important nations with volunteer armed forces . The Soviets ' military is ( hailed , and enlistees serve at least two to three years . Other Warsaw Pact countries maintain drafts in which recruits serve for from sixteen months to three years . France requires a one-year tour of duty ; Italy , from one year to eighteen months . Other Western European nations vary from slightly less than one year to about three years.ries to bring in more and better soldiers deserves attention because it is certain to win support . The Left , which would be pleased never to hear from the military again , will approve . So will those conservatives who think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also provide a good army ? an opinion that ignores the broad effects of turning an army into a business . Among its best soldiers this enterprise eliminates the idea of fulfilling one 's duty or , as is more likely , the dedication to one 's own unit ? and replaces it with the striving for money or career advancement . Stirrings and mutterings about military unions attest to this . So does the managerial mentality 's corrosive spread among officer ranks , a phenomenon that Richard Gabriel and Paul Savage describe in Crisis in Command . The authors , both professors at Saint Anseles College in New Hampshire , describe how the American military structure has changed since World War II and what that change has meant . They argue that when the Vietnam war accelerated in 1964 , " traditional military ethics which buttressed the code of duty-honorcountry had begun to weaken , and in their place the military officer was expected to operate within a code of ethics drawn largely from the practices of the free enterprise marketplace . " The new ethics naturally encouraged an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officers were sent to Vietnam for six-month tours , half the time enlisted men served , so that all of them might have a chance to experience war . Going into battle to experience it , however , is not the same as going to lead , and if the enlisted men did not understand the difference , they felt the effect . Combat-unit spirit and cohesion suffered because of frequent changes in leadership . Officers whose career interests directed them to lead their troops from helicopters also undermined the morale of fighting units . Gabriel and Savage 's observation about management technique in the officer corps applies equally to the question of a paid army . Military service is essentially different from other occupations because soldiers are expected to " be faithful unto death " ? an act for which no economist or managerial expert has yet devised financial or career incentives . T HE IMMEDIATE DIFFICULTY in attracting better enlistments at higher pay is at the core of military manpower today ; ironically , it is not really something the military can control . The problem is how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam war ended , the traditional grudging acceptance of the military positively soured . It has neither recovered since nor shown any sign of doing so . As a result , the middle class , which wants not only well-paying careers but respected ones , has steered clear of the army . It is simply unjust that the poor and minorities should assume an unequal share of defense burdens . But the nonrepresentation of basic civilian interests in a professional army is a greater source of potential trouble . When a state chooses to pay those who are less fortunate or foreigners for military responsibilities it no longer wishes to bear , there are domestic consequences . In Rome , the army became professional seventy years before Caesar 's death , when Caius Marius offered pay for service in his expedition against the African King Jugurtha . Until Marius , bearing arms was a citizen 's duty . After him , the armies were composed of professional soldiers owing allegiance not to Rome but to their generals , whose rivalry was pivotal in the republic 's decline . Such a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reject military actions than to see them as a plain on which great men vie for honor . In the face , though , of such persistent rejection , an entirely professional army is far more likely to embrace hard-line political opinions than an army that consists of the population at large . When a society loses respect for the military it is reasonable to expect that the military will lose respect for society . At that point traditions of military deference to political authority are hollow , raising at least the possibility of a coup . Current opinions about reinstating the draft range from confusion about the armed forces to abhorrence of them . The Secretary of the Army . Clifford Alexander , expresses the confusion . Replying to criticism that the army has a disproportionate number of blacks , Alexander observed last June that " the alarm is misdirected . The truly alarming fact is that unem employment among black teenagers is running at 40 percent . " The alarming fact , however , is that the Secretary of the Army is ignorant of his responsibilities . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or white teenagers ? or anybody . Neither do the army 's . Secretary Alexander should be occupied with preserving the army 's ability to fight . It comes as less of a surprise that others in Washington look upon the army as an escape valve for social problems , and the point will he made explicitly if Congress seriously debates resuming the draft . The existence of this opinion proves that people have forgotten what an army is for . A sample of the national press 's opinion shows much less confusion . William Greider , former editor of the Washington Post 's Sunday editorial section , wrote an attack on the draft and compulsory national service last February . " What , " he asked , " does the government have in mind for our children ? Do not give us the grand abstractions of Cold War ideology which satisfied most citizens in the past , the academic garble about ' global strength ' and ' the balance of power ' and all that . " Greider claimed to see " the formative outlines of an obscene coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell jointly this terrible idea . " A Gallup poll taken in the spring found an attitude among the citizenry somewhat short of coalition strength . After people were told that the armed forces have had trouble getting volunteers to meet manpower needs , the poll asked whether we should return to a draft . A fraction more than half of those questioned thought we should not . It is hard to overstate these answers . Half the nation , if the poll is accurate , believes a draft to he unnecessary even though the military is failing to meet its manpower requirements . G IVEN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE these opinions reflect , the most one may expect is passage of legislation to require registration for those eighteen to twenty-six years old so that their names would be available in an emergency . This will not address the volunteer army 's coming demographic problem , its shortage of reserves , or any other difficulty . It will provide the Warsaw Pact with an uncommonly reliable gauge of American intentions , since it is unthinkable that the system would be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat , there would n't be any time to train soldiers for a large-scale , modern , conventional war . Registration 's sole benefit is its chance to reacquaint citizens with the idea that they have duties . Universal national service in one of its many forms now before Congressional committees might have the same result , although that is questionable . It is more likely to bring forth another great bureau , costing an estimated $30 billion annually , and a lot of cynicism , because the government will then be actively condoning middle-class reluctance to serve under arms ? a predictable result of the choices entrants would be asked to make . A lottery draft , without exemptions , is the fairest way to supply the armed forces with manpower needs unmet by normal recruitment . A draft would fill the reserve shortage , eliminate the inequalities of an unrepresentative military , and ensure the supply of men . The draft , however , presupposes a society that considers lying to avoid military obligation disgraceful . It presupposes a society that has both a measure of respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A lack of the first equals an unwillingness to defend oneself that characterizes people who do not believe in themselves . The idea that citizens have no obligations is hardly new in the United States , but it has reached a peak with the institutional sanction the All-Volunteer Force stands for . Military service in a democracy is the obligation of a citizen , not because it may demand giving one 's life , but because arms protect the state that is responsible for giving and ensuring rights . If not gratitude , at least the self-interested wish to maintain those rights should persuade people to serve . When there is absolutely no understanding of citizen duty , rights are literally taken for granted . One look at the rest of the world ought to convince us that rights are tenuous indeed and that it is a mistake to take them for granted . The most telling sign of our resistance to the draft is that that is exactly what we are doing .                 @ @ @ @
