but there 's going to be a time when you begin at the factory when you wo n't be able to lick stamps so fast as the other boys at the desk . Yet the man who has n't licked stamps is n't fit to write letters . Naturally that is the time when knowing whether the pie comes before the ice cream , and how to run an automobile is n't going to be of any real use to you . I simply mention these things because I am afraid your ideas as to the basis on which you are coming with the house have swelled up a little in the East . I can give you a start , but after that you will have to dynamite your way to the front by yourself . It is all with the man . if you gave some fellows a talent wrapped in a napkin to start with in business , they would swap the talent for a gold brick and lose the napkin ; and there are others that you could start out with just a napkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small way and then coax the other fellow 's tal  --  ent into it . I have pride enough to believe that you have the right sort of stuff in you , but I want to see some of it come out . You will never make a good merchant of yourself by reversing the order in which the Lord decreed that we should pro  --  ceed  --  learning the spending before the earning end of business . Pay day is always a month off for the spendthrift , and he is never able to realize more than sixty cents on any dollar that comes to him . But a dollar is worth one hundred and six cents to a good business man , and he never spends the dollar . It is the man who keeps saving up and expenses down that buys an interest in the concern . That is where you are going to find yourself weak if your expense accounts do n't lie ; and they generally do n't he in that particular way . although Baron Munchausen was the first traveling man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that when a lot of young men get off by themselves some of them think that reckless  --  ness with money brands them as good fellows , and that carefulness is meanness . That is the one end of a college education that is pure cussed  --  ness ; and that is the one thing that makes nine business men out of ten hesitate to send their boys off to school . But on the other hand , that is the spot where a young man has the chance to show that he is not a lightweight . I know that a good many people say that I am a pretty close old proposition ; that 1 make every hog that goes through my packing-house give up more lard than the Lord gave him gross weight ; that I have im  --  proved on Nature to the extent of getting four hams out of an animal that began life with two ; but you have lived with me long enough to know that my hand is usually in my pocket at the right time .

When I told you that I wished you to get a liberal education , I did n't mean that I wanted to buy Cambridge . Of course the bills wo n't break me , but they will break you unless you are very , very careful . I have noticed for the last two years that your accounts have been growing heavier every month , but I have n't seen any signs of your taking honors to justify the increased operating expenses ; and that is bad business -- a good deal like feeding his weight in corn to a scalawag steer that wo n't fat up . I have n't said anything about this before , as I trusted a good deal to your native common-sense to keep you from making a fool of yourself in the way that some of these young fellows who have n't had to work for it do .

The sooner you adjust your spending to what your earning ca- pacity will be , the easier they will find it to live together . The only sure way that a man can get rich quick is to have it given to him or to inherit it . You are not going to get rich that way  --  at least , not until after you have proved your ability to hold a pretty important position with the firm ; and , of course , there is just one place from which a man can start for that position with Graham &; Co . It does n't make any difference whether he is the son of the old man or of the cellar boss  --  that place is the bottom .

It would do you no good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plenty of room at the top here , but there is no elevator in the building . Starting , as you do , with a good educa- tion , you should be able to climb quicker than the fellow who has n't got it ; June I , 189 Dear Pierrepont : No , I ca n't say that I think anything of your post-graduate course idea . You 're not going to be a poet or a professor , but a packer , and the place to take a post-graduate course for that calling is in the packing-house . Some men learn all they know from books ; others from life ; both kinds are narrow . The first are all theory ; the second are all practice . It 's the fellow who knows enough about practice to test his theories for blow-holes that gives the world a shove ahead , and finds a fair margin of profit in shoving it . There 's a chance for everything you have learned , from Latin to poetry , in the packing business , though we do n't use much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the only time our products are given Latin names is when the State Board of Health condemns them . But I think you 'll find it safe to go short a little on the frills of education ; if you want them bad enough you 'll find a way to pick them up later , after business hours . The main thing is to get a start along right lines , and that is what I sent you to college for . I did n't expect you to carry off all the education in sight-1 knew you 'd leave a little for the next fellow . But I wanted you to form good mental habits , just as I want you to have clean , straight physical ones . Because 1 was run through a threshing machine when I was a boy , and did n't begin to get the straw out of my hair until I was past thirty , I have n't any sympathy with a lot of these old fellows who go around bragging of their ignorance and saying that boys do n't need to know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty . We started in a mighty different world , and we were all ignorant together . The Lord let us in on the ground floor , gave us corner lots , and then started in to improve the adjacent property . We did n't have to know fractions to figure out our profits . Now a merchant needs astronomy to see them , and when he locates them they are out somewhere near the fifth decimal place . There are sixteen ounces to the pound still , but two of them are wrapping paper in a good many stores . And there 's just as many chances for a fellow as ever , but they 're a little gun shy , and you ca n't catch them by any such coarse method as putting salt on their tails . Thirty years ago you could take an old muz  --  zle-loader , and knock over plenty of ducks in the city limits , and Chicago was n't Cook County then , either . You can get them still , but you 've got to go to Kankakee and take a hammerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was all straight sailing  --  no frills  --  just turning hogs into hog meat  --  dry salt for the blacks down South and sugar-cured for the whites up North . Everything else was sausage , or thrown away . But when we get through with a hog nowadays he 's scattered through a hundred different cans and packages , and he 's all accounted for . What we used to throw away is our profit . It takes doc  --  tors , lawyers , engineers and poets , and I do n't know what , to run the business , and I reckon that improvements which call for parsons will be creeping in next . Naturally , a young man who ex  --  pects to hold his own when he is thrown in with a lot of men like these must be clean and sharp as a hound 's tooth , or some other fellow 's simply going to eat him up . The first college man I ever hired was old John Dur ham 's son Jim . That was a good many years ago when the house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of mon ey till he started out to buck the uni verse and corner wheat . And the boy took all the fancy courses and trim mings at college . The old man was mighty proud of Jim . Wanted him to ? it 's no joke be a literary fellow . But old Durham found out what every one learns who gets his ambitions mixed up with number two red  --  that there 's a heap of it lying around loose in the country . The bears did quick work and kept the cash wheat coming in so lively that one settling day half a dozen of us had to get under the market to keep it from going to everlasting smash . That day made young Jim Durham a candi  --  date for a job . It did n't take him long to decide that the Lord would attend to keeping up the vis  --  ible supply of poetry , and that he had better turn his attention to the stocks of mess pork . Next morning he was laying for me with a letter of intro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he found that I would n't have a pri  --  vate secre  --  tary at any price , he ap  --  plied for every other position on the premises right down to office boy . 1 told him I was sorry , but I could n't do any  --  thing for him then , that we were letting men go , but I 'd keep him in mind and so on . The fact was that I did n't think a fellow with Jim 's training would be much good , anyhow . But Jim hung on  --  said he 'd taken a fancy to the house , and wanted to work for it . Used to call by about twice a week to find out if anything had turned up . Finally , after about a month of this , he wore me down so that I stopped him one day as he was passing me on the street . I thought I 'd find out if he really was so red-hot to work as he pre  --  tended to be ; besides , I felt that perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 had delivered quite a jag of that wheat to his father myself . " Hello , Jim , " I called ; " do you still want that job ? " " Yes , sir , " he answered , quick as lightning . " Well , I tell you how it is , Jim . " I said , look  --  ing up at him  --  he was one of those husky , lazy-moving six-footers ? " I do n't see any chance in the office , but I understand they can use another good , strong man in one of the loading gangs . " 1 thought that would settle Jim and let me out , for it 's no joke lugging beef , or rolling bar  --  rels and tierces a hundred yards or so to the cars . But Jim came right back at me with , " Done . Who 'll l report to ? " Continued on page 111 June 25 , 189 Dear Pierrepont : Your letter of the seventh twists around the point a good deal like a setter chasing his tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend a couple of months in Europe before coming on here and getting your nose in the bull  --  ring . Of course , you are your own boss now , and you ought to be able to judge better than any one else how much time you have to waste , but it seems to me , on general princi  --  ples , that a young man of twenty-two , who is physical  --  ly and mentally sound , and who has n't got a dol  --  lar and has never earned one , ca n't be getting on somebody 's pay-roll too quick . And in t his connection it is only fair to tell you that 1 have instructed the cashier to discontinue your allowance after July 15 . That gives you two weeks for a vacation  --  enough to make a sick boy well , or a lazy one lazier . I hear a good deal about men who wo n't take vacations , and who kill themselves by overwork , but it 's usually worry or whiskey . It 's not what a man does during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . A fellow and his business should be bosom friends in the office and sworn enemies out of it . A clear mind is one that is swept clean of business at six o'clock every night and is n't opened up for it again until after the shutters are taken down next morning . Some fellows leave the office at night and start out to whoop it up with the boys , and some go home to sit up with their troubles  --  they 're both in bad company . They 're the men who are always needing vacations , and never getting any good out of them . What every man does need once a year is a change of work  --  that is , if he has been curved up over a desk for fifty weeks and subsisting on birds and burgundy , he ought to take to fishing for a living and try bacon and eggs with a little spring water for dinner . But coming from Harvard to the packing-house would give you change enough this year to keep you in good trim , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose . You will always find it a safe rule to take a thing just as quick as it is offered  --  especially a job . It is never easy to get one except when you do n't want it ; but when you have to get work , and go after it with a gun , you 'll find it as shy as an old crow that every farmer in the county has had a shot at . When I was a young fellow and out of a place I always made it a rule to take the first job that offered , and to use it for bait . You can catch a minnow with a worm , and a bass will take your minnow . A good fat bass will tempt an otter , and then you 've got something worth skinning . Of course , there 's no danger of your not being able to get a job with the house  --  in fact , there is no real way in which you can escape getting one ; but I do n't like to see you shy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the halter . I want you to learn right at the outset not to play with the spoon before you take the medi  --  cine . Putting off an easy thing makes it hard , and putting off a hard one makes it impossible . Pro  --  crastination is the longest word in the language , but there 's only one letter between its ends when they occupy their proper places in the alphabet . Old Dick Stover , for whom I once clerked in Indiana , was the worst hand at procrastinating that I ever saw . Dick was a powerful hearty eater , and no one ever loved meal-time better , but he used to keep turning over in bed mornings for just another wink and staving off getting up , un  --  til finally his wife combined breakfast and dinner on him , and he only got two meals a day . He was a mighty religious man , too , but he got to put  --  ting off saying his prayers until after he was in bed , and then he would keep passing them along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end he would drop off to sleep without say  --  ing them at all . What between missing the Sun  --  day morning service and never being seen on his knees , the first thing Dick knew he was turned out of the church . He had a pretty good business when I first went with him , but he would keep putting off firing his bad clerks until they had lit out with the petty cash ; and he would keep put  --  ting off raising the salaries of his good ones until his competitor had hired them away . Finally , he got so that he would n't discount his bills , even when he had the money ; and when they came due he would give notes so as to keep from pay  --  ing out his cash a little longer . Running a busi  --  ness on those lines is , of course , equivalent to making a will in favor of the sheriff and com  --  mitting suicide so that he can inherit . The last I heard of Dick he was ninety-three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , and I 'll bet he 's living yet . I simply mention Dick in pass  --  ing as an instance of how habits rule a man 's life . There is one excuse for every mistake a man can make , but only one . When a fellow makes the same mistake twice he 's got to throw up both hands and own up to carelessness or cussedness . Of course , I knew that you would make a fool of yourself pretty often when I sent you to college , and I have n't been disappointed . But I expected you to narrow down the number of combina  --  tions possible by making a different sort of a fool of yourself every time . That is the important thing unless a fellow has too lively an imagina  --  tion , or has none at all . You are bound to try this European foolishness sooner or later , but if you will wait a few years you will approach it in an entirely different spirit  --  and you will come back with a good deal of respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . I piece out from your letter that you expect a few months on the other side will sort of put a polish on you . I do n't want to seem pessimistic , but I have seen hundreds of boys graduate from college and go over with the same idea , and they did n't bring back a great deal except a few trunks of badly fitting clothes . Seeing the world is like charity  --  it covers a multitude of sins , and , like charity , it ought to begin at home . Culture is not a matter of a change of climate . You 'll hear more about Browning to the square foot in the Mississippi Valley than you will in England . And there 's as much Art talk on the Lake front as in the Latin Quarter . It may be a little different , but it 's there . I went to Europe once myself . I was pretty raw when I left Chicago , and I was pretty sore when I got back . Coming and going , I was simply sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , I was taken for an easy thing . Every time I went into a store there was a bull movement . The clerks all knocked off their regular work and started in to mark up prices . They used to tell me that they did n't have any gold-brick men over there . So they do n't . They deal in pictures  --  old masters , they call them . I bought two  --  you know the ones  --  those hanging in the waiting-room at the stock yards ; and when I got back I found out that they had been painted by a measly little fellow who went to Paris to study art after Bill Harris had found out that he was no good as a settling clerk . I keep ' em to remind myself that there 's no fool like an old American fool when he gets this picture paresis . The fellow who tried to fit me out with a coat-of-arms did n't find me so easy . I picked mine when I first went into business for my  --  self  --  a charging steer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's my trade-mark , of course , and that 's the only coat-of-arms an American merchant has any business with . It 's penetrated to every quar  --  ter of the globe in the last twenty years , and every soldier in the world has carried it  --  in his knapsack . I take just as much pride in it as the fellow // Now I want to say right here that the meanest man alive is the one who is generous with money that he has not had to sweat for , and that the boy who is a good fellow at some one else 's expense would not work up in  --  to first-class fertilizer . That same ambition to be known as a good fel  --  low has crowded my office with sec  --  ond rate clerks , and they will always be second rate clerks . If you have it , hold it down until you have worked for a year . Then , if your ambition runs to hunching up all week over a desk , to earn eight dollars to blow on a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no objec  --  tion to your gratifying it ; for I will know that the Lord did n't intend you to be your own boss . You know how I began  --  I was started off with a kick , but that was a kick up , and in the end every one since has lifted me a little bit higher . I got two dollars a week , and slept under the counter , and you can bet I knew just how many pennies there were in each of those dollars and how hard the floor was . That is what you have got to learn . I remember when I was on the Lakes , our schooner was passing out through the draw at Buffalo when I saw little Bill Riggs , the butcher , standing up above me on the end of the bridge with a big roast of beef in his basket . They were a little short in the galley on that trip , so I called to Bill and he threw the roast down to me . I asked him how much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was mighty good beef , and when we struck Buffalo again on the return trip I thought I would like a little more of it . So I went up to Bill 's shop and asked him for a piece of the same . But this time he gave me a lit  --  tle roast , not near so big as the other , and it was pretty tough and stringy . But when I asked him how much , he answered " about a dollar . " He sim  --  ply did n't have any sense of values , and that 's the business man 's sixth sense . Bill has always been a big , healthy , hard-working man , but to  --  day he is very , very poor . The Bills ai n't all in the butcher business . I 've got some of them right now in my office , but they will never climb over the railing that separates the clerks from the executives . Yet if they would put in half the time thinking for the house that they give up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdraw their salary accounts , I could n't keep them out of our private offices with a pole-axe , and I would n't want to ; for they could double their salaries and my profits in a year . But I always lay it down as a safe proposition that the fellow who has to break open the baby 's bank for car-fare toward the last of the week is n't going to be any Russell Sage when it comes to trad  --  ing with the old man 's money . He 'd punch my bank account as full ofholes as a carload of wild Texans would a fool stockman that they 'd got in a corner . Now I know you 'll say that I do n't understand how it is ; that you 've got to do as the other fellows do , and that things have changed since I was a boy . There 's nothing in it . Adam invented all the different ways in which a young man can make a fool of himself , and the col  --  lege yell at the end of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy who does anything just be  --  cause the other fellows do it is apt to scratch a poor man 's back all his life . He 's the chap that 's buying wheat at ninety-seven cents the day before the market breaks . They call him " the country " in the market reports , but the city 's full of him . It 's the fel  --  low who has the spunk to think and act for himself , and sells short when prices hit the high C and the house is standing on its hind legs yelling for more , that sits in the directors ' meet  --  ings when he gets on toward forty . We 've got an old steer out at the packing-house that stands around at the foot of the runway leading up to the killing pens , looking for all the world like one of the village fathers sitting on the cracker box before the grocery  --  sort of sad-eyed , dreamyold cuss  --  always has two or three straws from his cud sticking out of the corner of his mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took less interest in things . But by and by the boys drive a bunch of steers toward him , or cows maybe , if we 're canning , and then you 'll see Old Abe move off up that runway , sort of beckoning the bunch after him with that wicked old stump of a tail of his , as if there was something mighty interesting to steers at the top , and something that every Texan and Colorado , raw from the prairies , ought to have a look at to put a metropolitan finish on him . Those steers just naturally follow along on up that runway and into the killing pens . But just as they get to the top Old Abe someways gets lost in the crowd and he is n't among those pres  --  ent when the gates are closed and the real trouble begins for his new friends . I never saw a dozen boys together that there was n't an Old Abe among them . If you find your crowd follow  --  ing him keep away from it . There are times when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little common-sense , caution and conscience . You can stock a store with those three com  --  modities , when you get enough ofthem . But you 've got to begin getting them young . They ai n't catching after you toughen up a bit . You need n't write me if you feel yourself getting them . The symp  --  toms will show in your expense ac  --  count . Goodby ; life 's too short to write letters and New York 's calling me on the wire . That sporty way of answenng , as if he were closing a bet , made me surer than ever that he was not cut out for a butcher . But I told him , and off he started hot-foot to find his foreman . I sent word by another route to see that he got plenty to do . I forgot all about Jim until about three months later , when his name was handed up to me for a new place and a raise in pay . It seemed that he had sort of abolished his job . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport had ground down one of his shoulders a couple of inches farther than the other , he got to scheming around for a way to make the work easier , and he hit on an idea for a sort of overhead railroad sys  --  tem , by which the barrels could be swung out of the storerooms and run right along into the cars , and two or three men do the work of a gang . It was just as I thought . Jim was lazy , but he had put the house in the way of saving so much money that I could n't fire him . So I raised his sal  --  ary , and made him an assistant time  --  keeper and checker . Jim kept at this for three or four months , until his feet began to hurt him , I guess , and then he was out of a job again . It seems he had heard something about a new machine for registering the men , that did away with most of the timekeepers except the fellows who watched the machines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put them in . Of course he claimed a raise again for effecting such a saving , and we just had to allow it . I was beginning to take an interest in Jim , so I brought him up into the office and set him to copying circu  --  lar letters . We used to send out a raft of them to the trade . That was just before the general adoption of type  --  writers , when they were still in the experimental stage . But Jim had n't been in the office plugging away at the letters fora month before he had the writers ' cramp , and began nosing around again . The first thing I knew he was sicking the agents for the new typewriting machine on to me , and he kept them pounding away until they had made me give them a trial . Then it was all up with Mister Jim 's 2A job again . I raised his salary without his asking for it this time , and put him out on the road to introduce a new product that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without sell  --  ing enough to keep them working overtime at the factory , and then he came into my office with a long story about how we were doing it all wrong . Said we ought to go for the consumer by advertising , and make the trade come to us , instead of chasing it up . That was so like Jim that I just laughed at first ; besides , that sort of advertising was a pretty new thing then , and I was one of the old-timers that did n't take any stock in it . But Jim just kept plugging away at me between trips , until I finally took him off the road and told him to go ahead and try it in a small way . Jim pretty nearly scared me to death that first year . At last he had got into something that he took an interest in  --  spending money  --  and he just fairly wallowed in it . Used to lay awake nights thinking up new ways of getting rid of the old man 's pro  --  fits . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away from Graham 's Extract , and whenever l saw it I gagged , for I knew it was costing me money that was n't coming back ; but every time I started to draw in my horns Jim talked to me , and showed me where there was a fortune wait  --  ing for me just around the corner . Graham 's Extract started out by being something that you could make beef-tea out of  --  that was all . But before Jim had been fooling with it a month he had got his girl to think up a hundred different ways in which it could be used , and had ad  --  vertised them all . It seemed there was nothing you could cook that did n't need a dash of it . He kept me between a chill and a sweat all the time . Sometimes , but not often , I just had to grin at his foolishness . I remember one picture he got out showing sixteen cows , or there  --  abouts , standing between something that looked like a letter-press , and telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juice squeezed from a herd of steers . If an explorer started for the North Pole Jim would send him a case of Extract , and then advertise that it was the great heat-maker for cold cli  --  mates ; and if some other fellow started across Africa he sent him a case , too , and advertised what a bully drink it was served up with a little ice . He broke out in a new place every day , and every time he broke out it cost the house money . Finally , I made up my mind to swallow the loss , and Mister Jim was just about to lose his job sure enough , when the orders for Extract began to look up , and he got a reprieve ; then he began to make expenses and lie got a par  --  don ; and finally a rush came that left him high and dry in a permanent place . Jim was all right in his way , but it was a new way , and I had n't been broad-gauged enough to see that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the con  --  nection between a college education and business .

Maybe they 'd have gone back to thinking of Gordie Green as the iceman . But Cappy Rush , the umpire , picked up the ball that had rolled out of the catcher 's mitt . He handed it to Gordie as though he realized Gordie would want to keep it and remember that day . Gordie stood with the ball in his hand . A few people had started to sift from their seats , but most were frozen in place , not yet recovered from surprise and excitement . They saw Gordie when he ran over to the guard rail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they gave them both , the ball player and the girl , a standing ovation . " The crowds loved Gordie after that , " I told the boys around the table , " and he loved them . He retired after another season and soon was named manager of the Bards . The team never had a more popular pilot . " " It 's a good story , Pop , " said Peters , " but if you brought Gordie and the girl together , why did n't she give you more of a greeting just now ? " " She saw me earlier today . " I was putting on my topcoat . " As a matter of fact , she visits me whenever she 's in town . She 's my daughter . " Then I grabbed my hat and got out of there fast , leaving the boys the check .
