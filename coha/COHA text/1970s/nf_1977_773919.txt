It is only in one 's reflective awareness of the knowing process that he can know what it is to know . Reflection ( ( 12:166d ) , therefore , is the key to the problem of knowledge ; only through its use does man realize that what presents itself to him as sensible is also intelligible and so is understood by his intellect in terms of its proper object , being . Equipped with the first principles of being , themselves neither postulates nor dogmatic assertions but starting points that his mind must and naturally does embrace , he gradually builds up his understanding of things , distinguishing between one and many , being in nature and being in knowledge , whole and part , cause and effect , and so on . Finally , by reflecting on his knowledge of things in the light of intelligible being , itself the universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the intellect judging and the thing judged , and so is prepared to address the problems of knowledge in all their complexity . 3 . A convenient way of developing a science of knowledge along such lines is to set it out in terms of the four scientific questions first proposed by Aristotle , namely , ( 1 ) Does the thing exist ( an sit ? ) ; ( 2 ) What is it ( quid sit ? ) ; ( 3 ) What are its properties ( an sit talis ? or quia ? ) ; and ; 4 ) Why does it have these properties ( propter quid ? ) . Each of these questions can be meaningfully asked about knowledge , except the first . With regard to knowledge one need not inquire about its existence , for this is a fact of immediate experience ; indeed , if there were no such thing as knowledge , the so-called problem of knowledge would never arise . The remaining three questions , however , provide an adaptable structure for developing the discipline : the answer to ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3 ) , the properties of truth and falsity ; and that to ( 4 ) , the nature of evidence and the certitude it engenders . Each of these will be considered in turn . // ? 38 . KNOWLEDGE 1 . The most important thing to note about knowledge 8 : 224b ) is that it is not the result of a physical or mechanical process ; rather it is a perfection found only in living things , a vital and immanent operation whereby one thing ( the knower ) becomes another ( the thing known ) in an intentional way ? 23 . Once this is seen one can define knowledge generally as the possession of something in an immaterial fashion , or the possession of the form of , a. thing without its matter ? 35.5 . The one knowing or possessing the form is called the subject ( 13:757c ) and the thing known or the form possessed is called the object ( 10:607d ) . Knowledge never occurs except in this framework of subject-object relatedness . Apart from knowledge , the subject has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organism or a person ; the object too has not yet begun to be an object , but is simply a thing , sensible or intelligible but not yet known . A being is constituted an object only by some relation that it begins to have to some living thing having the power of knowing , which simultaneously becomes a subject . 2 . The correlative reference of subject and object can be stated in another way , namely , by stressing that all knowledge involves an element of interiority or immanence ( 7:385d ) and an element of exteriority or transcendence ( 14:233d ) . The interiority of knowing demands an operation that proceeds from a living thing , an operation having its roots in immateriality ? 23.3 and thus completely different from any kind of motion in matter ? 18 ; the exteriority of knowing , on the other hand , demands a real relation to something other than the self , an object to which the subject becomes related through some type of intentionality ? 23.4 . This means that a cognitive power is a living relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act of cognition ? 23 ; the object , on the other hand , has neither a real relation to the subject nor any real dependence on it . The difference between being and being known is merely a distinction of reason ? 10.6-8. 3 . In some theories knowledge is identified with consciousness // ( 4:206d ) . Despite their close connection the two are not the same . Consciousness is a state of greater or less awareness in a cognitive being ; as such , it should not be substantialized and made a reality in itself . Man 's conscious act is an act of knowledge that involves knowing one 's internal operations and dispositions and oneself as subject to them . These operations may in turn be acts of knowledge , but they may also be non-cognitive acts such as wishing or walking . It is possible also that knowledge occur without consciousness , as happens when one dreams or experiences an external sensation during sleep . Consciousness and knowledge are simultaneous when one knows an object and at the same time is aware of oneself as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge . The most fundamental division is that into sense knowledge and intellectual knowledge , which has already been discussed ? ? 24-25 . Another division is that between actual and habitual knowledge . At any given moment the activity of one 's cognitive powers is producing in him actual knowledge ; yet some of these powers are capable of preserving knowledge and recalling it when the objects previously known are no longer present . Such habitual knowledge is preserved through qualities that are more or less permanent , such as the phantasm on the sensory level ? 24.8 and the concept or idea on the intellectual ? 25.2 . Yet another distinction is that between knowledge that is immediate or intuitive and that which is mediate or discursive . In the first type , sometimes known as intuition ( 7:598d ) , the knowledge arises either from the direct contact of a power with its object or the direct intellectual grasp of a proposition whose terms are seen to be necessarily related ? 36.2 . In the second , known as reasoning ? 5.1 , there is a progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized as being based on , and implicated with , the propositions already known . ? 39 . TRUTH AND FALSITY 1 . The term truth ( 14:327a ) means in general some kind of 1 13 THE ELEMENTS OF PHILOSOPHY ? 39 agreement between thought and its object , between knowledge and that which is known . It is sometimes applied to things , and a thing is said to be true in the sense of ontological truth ? 32.4 . In reference to speech , truth is called veracity or truthfulness ? 14 : 335d , and is present when a person expresses what is in his mind . But the primary meaning of the word refers to the truth of the intellect , the truth of thought as opposed to the derived notions of truth of being and truth of speech . In this sense truth is a property of intellectual knowledge and is defined as the adequation of intellect and thing . 2 . Since truth in its most general sense is a conformity of knowledge with its object , it is possible to apply the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sensory knowledge ? 24 , insofar as these are in genuine conformity with their respective objects . The intuitive contact of the senses with their proper objects guarantees the validity of sense knowledge ( 13:89b ) and thus its truth . The actual impinging of the object on the senses is the objective grounding of all human knowledge . Only in experience ( 5:750d ) can intellectual knowledge be resolved , and since the external senses are ultimate among the cognitive powers , either man contacts reality through them or he never contacts it at all . So the lack of any one of the senses deprives the knower of all the knowledge that particular sense might have apprehended . Aberrations in sense knowledge can arise , of course , but these are traceable either to defective senses , to improper media , or to some disproportion existing between the sense and its object , e.g. , when one fails to perceive objects too small for sight . Assuming a normal state for the sense organ , however , and the absence of other aberrations , whenever there is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If one senses , he senses something ; and if he senses something , he senses it as it is ? 24 . The . same general evaluation applies to intellectual knowledge in its apprehensive dimension ; the intellect , in simply knowing what a thing is through the idea or concept , apprehends what it knows and knows it as it is ? 25 . The basic reason for this is that the proper object of the intellect is being , and so intellectual knowing manifests itself in the living // relation of the intellect to being , to the real . Just as color is necessarily perceived by sight , so being is necessarily understood by the intellect . Assuming that the object is properly sensed and perceived , the intellect spontaneously grasps its essential determinations or its meaning and formulates this in the concept ? 25.2 . The validity of all apprehensive knowledge is thus assured by the necessary relationship that exists between the powers of such knowledge and their respective objects . Truth at this level is necessary and unavoidable ; it is built into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this type of truth , sometimes called material truth , even though naturally guaranteed , is as imperfect as the apprehensive knowledge of which it is a necessary and infallible property . 3 . Truth in its full significance and in a formal sense is found only in the second act of the mind , the judgment ? 4 . To understand this one must recognize that in apprehension the mind grasps only bits and snatches of the real . Through his concepts man appropriates to himself isolated elements of reality , or single aspects of the things he knows , without putting these aspects and isolated elements together as they are found in nature . Only through a series of judgments does he begin the process of unifying this knowledge to bring it into conformity with the constitution of things in the world ? 4.1 . When the intellect makes the unification in a way that corresponds to the actual unity found in the object known , the mind enunciates a proposition that is true and so attains truth . When the enunciation is at variance with the mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In apprehension the mind simply grasps an object and represents it to itself conceptually ; in this function it has no alternative to presenting the object as it has been stimulated by it . But in judgment , the dynamic act of composing and dividing apprehended concepts , the mind no longer depends solely on the object represented but produces something new and original , i.e. , a composition or division contributed by itself . It is this original element , a new unity , that opens up the possibility of formal truth or falsity , 4 . The validity of judgment poses the key problem in the analysis of truth , and yet this too dissolves when one realizes that 1 15 THE ELEMENTS OF PHILOSOPHY ? 39 the human mind was made to know truth and spontaneously recognizes it in self-evident principles ? 11 ; these it neither has to learn nor assume but simply grasps as soon as it understands the meaning of their constituent terms . The mind is further reinforced in its pursuit of truth by habits that it can acquire ? 50.3 and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36.2 whereby it becomes proficient in making primary judgments , and science ? 13 and wisdom ? 36 whereby it attains skill in moving from such judgments to conclusions . But the touchstone of truth , the bridge that closes the gap between the mind and reality , is the judgment whereby the intellect assents to first indemonstrable principles ? 11 . To such principles the mind comes naturally and necessarily in its inspection of reality , whether they be formulated in terms of the general modes of being common to everything , or in terms of the special modes of being proper to the different kinds of things in man 's experience . And the ultimate test of the truth of any other scientific judgment can only be the analytic resolution of that judgment back to these first principles . This does not mean that from such principles all knowledge can be deduced , but only that before anything can be deduced they must be admitted and correctly applied . 5 . Given the mind 's natural propensity to attain knowledge , falsity ( 5:824a ) is more difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be applied to things in the sense of ontological falsity ( 5:825a ) , to speech in the sense of lying ( 8 : 1107 ) , and to intellection or judgment in the sense of being an inadequation or lack of conformity between intellect and thing . The latter type of falsity is also known as error ( 5:521a ) ; it is to be distinguished from ignorance ? 52.4 , which is the lack of knowledge in one naturally capable of having it , and from nescience , a similar lack in one not so capable . The possibility of error or of falsity of judgment arises , as has been seen , because judging is not a merely passive reception but an active synthesizing and interpreting of innumerable and diverse apprehensions at the level of both sense and intellect . When the intellect judges falsely it does so because it has not given sufficient attention or has not reflected adequately on the data of sense , the association of per ? // cepts , the reliability of memory , the connecting reasoning , or the validity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflecting on these sources and so not withholding its assent until sure it has sufficient evidence for it ? 40.4 . In such a condition it asserts as true what only seems to be true , and hence it asserts beyond what it knows . And it makes such an assertion under the influence of other powers , particularly the will . The will , either by reason of its attachment to prejudices , or by its impatience or disinclination to effort , or by not applying its attention , can move the intellect to judge what only seems to be ? 28.4 . All falsity lies in this chasm between seeming and being . If something did not seem true , man could not assent to it , since his intellect is a faculty of truth . Yet his intellect can take the seeming true for being true because its judgment is under the influence of the will , the emotions , and other powers ? 28.6 . From the point of view of the intellect , no error is inevitable . 6 . The foregoing account is sometimes referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other accounts , and of these the principal are ( 1 ) the intellectualist or rationalist , ( 2 ) the coherence or consistency , and ( 3 ) the pragmatist or instrumentalist theories ( 14:331c-332b ) . ( 1 ) The intellectualist theory would maintain that whatever man conceives clearly and distinctly must be true , or that something can be true only if the knower can not conceive the opposite . This theory contains a partial truth , for a clearly perceived nature is the ground for judging the true and so fpr being unable to conceive the opposite . Yet the latter part of the theory is stated in a negative and misleading way . One does not see judgments as true because he can not conceive the opposite ; rather he is unable to conceive the opposite because he sees his judgments to be necessarily true . ( 2 ) The coherence theory would maintain that the truth of a proposition must be measured by its consistency with the whole system of knowledge , i.e. , by the harmony of all judgments with one another . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a negative criterion in the sense that truth can not contradict truth ; of two contradictories , moreover , one at least must be false . But the fact remains that both may be false and that any series of judgments 1 17 THE ELEMENTS OF PHILOSOPHY ? 40 may be totally compatible and yet totally untrue . The only sure test , therefore , is that a judgment conform , not to other judgments , but to reality itself . ( 3 ) The pragmatist theory would hold that truth is something relative and has reference to a changing reality ; things are never true in themselves but only in their application to existential situations . In this theory the notion of truth is replaced by that of verification ? 67.1 , either actual or possible . This is also a correspondence theory , but since the adequation is not to being but to becoming , the correspondence is at best operational . While eminently concerned with the practical , the pragmatist theory neglects entirely the intellectual and the speculative on which the practical itself depends , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ephemeral must ultimately be judged ? 66.4. ? 40 . EVIDENCE AND CERTITUDE 1 . The immediate guarantee of the truth of a judgment , and therefore the reason why the intellect ultimately affirms it , is what is called evidence ( 5:662b ) . Derived from the Latin eviclentia ( e-videre , from seeing ) , evidence means clearness and apparentness ; in the context of epistemology , it is the clearness and apparentness of the existing real as apprehended through the light of understanding . The certitude of the principles and conclusions of all human knowledge rest ultimately upon such evidence . 2 . Evidence may be distinguished in accord with various manifestations of existing reality as ( 1 ) evidence of facts or events , where it is a question of particulars of sense or reflection ; and ( ( 2 ) evidence of principles , where it is a question of the intelligible structure of being itself . ( 1 ) Some evidence of facts or events is grasped instantly by all , as for example the fact of one 's own existence and the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifests itself more or less completely according to the degree of careful inspection and the experience and training of the observer . All of science , indeed , depends upon the accumulation of such evidence of facts and events // ? 67.1-3. ( 2 ) With regard to the evidence of principles , apart from what has already been said about the self-evidence of first principles ? ? 11 , 32.6 , 36.2 , the intelligible structure of being is evident to all in a general and confused way . A more precise understanding of the evidence of principles proper to the various sciences is attained only through the concentrated attention of the specialist , whether he be metaphysician , natural philosopher , or scientist ? 11.3-6 . But the natural character of such evidence is also reflected at the level of common sense in man 's spontaneous striving toward a unified understanding of all of experience , and in his equally spontaneous and constant search for explanations of events in terms of source and purpose . 3 . Certitude ( 3:408a ) is a term deriving from the Latin cernere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evidence . It designates a state of mind of the knower which is characterized positively by his firmness of assent to a given judgment and negatively by his exclusion of all prudent fear of error . It is to be distinguished from other states of mind , such as doubt ( 4:1023a ) , which is an inability either to affirm or deny , and opinion ( 10:705a ) , which is the acceptance of a judgment as probable . It is not incompatible , however , with belief or faith ( 5:798b ) , whereby a person assents to truths that are not seen and can not be proved but are taken on trust in the reliability of another . Since the intellect is made for knowing truth , and its perfect actuation is had only when the truth is known with evidence , formal certitude is defined as the state of mind that results when what is known presents itself as objectively evident . 4 . Of special importance for acquiring this state of mind are the firm assents that are acquired by the natural operations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known . Whenever this sort of certitude is had it is characterized by the note of necessity , whether grasped intuitively by immediate assents or discursively by mediate assents . The intuitive grasp of first principles , as has been said repeatedly , is the bedrock of such objective certitudes . But while these principles are grasped with supreme evidence and certitude , it must be admitted that they are very general in content and come far from 1 19 THE ELEMENTS OF PHILOSOPHY ? 40 satisfying man 's desire for truth . Thus it is better to see them as a sort of seedbed wherein truths are contained in an imperfect manner , and which must be brought to flower in the actual and certain knowledge of what is virtually contained in them . In this transition from imperfect to more and more perfect knowledge , doubt can play a positive role in preventing error and in initiating serious inquiry . When cogent evidence in support of a proposition is lacking , for example , one ought to suspend judgment lest , under influences extrinsic to objective truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive corruption , error ? 39.5 . Doubt can also promote the discovery of truth in view of its association with wonder ( 14:1004b ) in the genesis of knowledge . Wonder is a kind of emotional shock , a species of fear that occurs when one confronts an effect , the cause of which he does not know . Out of the initial state of wonder there arises a sort of doubt that is not a symptom of uncertainty but a stimulus to investigation . When this incipient doubt is elaborated into technically formulated difficulties ( dubitabilia ) against some position , the mind is in a state called aporia ( 1:678d ) . An aporia does not spring from nowhere , but from an imperfect knowledge of things and from the natural curiosity or drive of the mind . Without it one would not know what to look for and whether to stop or to continue the investigation ; with it he is better able to judge the truth when it appears . Thus aporia is not a skeptical doubt , nor does it lead to skepticism ( 13:275d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hopes to know something more or better . It does not take away certitude , nor does it commit one to an aimless search . Rather it urges him to proceed hopefully in the light of what he already knows toward the solution of a clearly formulated question or problem , and thus ultimately to arrive at the perfection of truth . CHAPTER 7 . NATURAL THEOLOGY ? 41 . NATURAL THEOLOGY 1 . Metaphysics , as has been seen , takes its rise from the recognition that there is a realm of beings , of substances , beyond the physical ? 30.2 . Does this mean that metaphysics can have God for its subject ? In terms of what has already been said about the object of any human science , i.e. , that it must have prior principles and also parts or attributes that belong to it per se ? 13.3 , the answer must be in the negative . Metaphysics has being qua being or common being as its subject ? 30.3 . As such it studies all beings that do not depend on matter for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in matter or ( 2 ) because they are sometimes in matter and sometimes not ( 2:232a-c ) . To the second group belong the subjects already investigated , viz , substance , potency , act , essence , existence , etc. ; it is to the consideration of these that the mind must turn when it wishes to attain natural knowledge of the divine , the being pre-eminent in the first group . Thus if metaphysics is to be a theology , it can be this only indirectly . Even though the intellect of man has all of being as its adequate object , its proper object remains the quiddity of the material thing ? 25.4 . This accents what has been called the grandeur and the misery of metaphysics : though its scope is broad enough to reach to God , it is most familiar with , and can best understand , material substance . Not being able to know God directly , it can seek knowledge of him only as he is related to material things as their principle or first cause . When meta ? // physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " first philosophy " or natural theology ( 14:61a ) . 2 . The basic steps whereby philosophy transforms itself into natural theology may be detailed roughly as follows ( 6 : 546b-d ) . The first step is the discovery of being as an intelligible value of the experienced real , one that is not attained properly in natural philosophy with its consideration of the things of experience as merely changeable ? 15 . With this initial discovery comes the realization that things need to be evaluated as they are existents , and further that through this distinctive grade of intelligibility something of the nature of any reality whatsoever can be known and expressed ? 30 . At this point metaphysics is already conscious of its status as a first philosophy , of its being an ultimate and absolute account of all reality . In its apprehension of being as such , moreover , it is already on the way to being self-vindicating through its awareness of being 's own evidence , made clear in epistemology ? 37 . On the basis of the distinctive character of its subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those at the Ievel of the corporeal and the human . Through study of the ways in which these are beings it discovers composition , imperfection , and limitation ? 33 ; with them comes the knowledge that such beings are not self-explanatory . It is at this juncture that the inquiry for an explanation leads to the affirmation of their dependence on a first cause . This very dependence demands that the first cause be free of the same dependence ; as cause , it must be a being not composed of essence and existence as really distinct principles . From this vantage point , metaphysics , already become natural theology , is in a position to demonstrate that being in every other case is so composed , and thus must necessarily manifest all the aspects of limitation that started the inquiry in the first place . 3 . The foregoing way of locating natural theology within the domain of philosophy offers the advantage that it does not require presuppositions of a non-philosophical nature . No nominal definition of God need be assumed or tailored to fit such pre-suppositions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dependence of all being upon him . The Christian 's recog123 THE // nition of God in this discovery does not have to be incorporated into the philosophical enterprise , as it usually is in Christian philosophy ? 1.8 . And the basis and vindication of natural theology as the perfection of metaphysics are autonomous , relying only on the self-assurance afforded by being , the subject of the science . 4 . There are other ways of conceiving the nature of natural theology and its relation to metaphysics , and these will now be briefly detailed ( 14:62d ) . Some hold that the question of God 's existence should be treated at the outset of a unified science of metaphysics , following Aquinas ' procedure of treating this question at the beginning of his Summa theologiae . Others hold that this is an introductory question that establishes the subject of special metaphysics , which is distinguished from general metaphysics in that it is concerned with uncreated being . Yet others hold that the question of God 's existence is a terminal one in the study of ontology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of a special metaphysics , called theodicy ( 14:14b ) , another name for natural theology . And still others hold that the question is a terminal one in the science of metaphysics itself , which is one science that admits of no division into general and special . This last position is implicit in what has already been said and in much of the subsequent development of this chapter . ( For a fuller account , see 14:62d-64d ) . ? 42 . PARTICIPATION AND THE ACT OF BEING 1 . The crucial juncture in the development already sketched ? 41.2 is the metaphysician 's discovery of composition , imperfection , and limitation in the beings of experience and of their consequent dependence on a first cause . This discovery and its implications are best explained in terms of Aquinas ' insight into the being of experience as " that which finitely participates existence " ( 2:232c ) and in terms of the subtle dialectic whereby he attains that insight . To grasp this one must recall that there is a being that is common , an esse commune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 34 . Now the possibility // is further suggested that there might be a being that is common in another sense ? not predicably common as existence is to substance and accident , but common in the sense of a unity whose causality extends to all other beings and whose perfection is only partially shared by them ? 7.2 . This commonality of being is most readily conceptualized under the aspect of existence known in Latin as esse and anglicized as the " to be , " the act of being or of existing discerned only through metaphysical analysis ? 33.5 ; this is not given immediately in experience , as is the " is " that is simply predicated of substance and accident . Such existence under the aspect of esse , the act of being , now requires examination in light of Aquinas ' teaching on participation ? 35.12 , and in this light will be seen to demand the existence of a subsistent being , a first cause known as ipsum esse subsistens , the study of whose existence and attributes pertains to natural theology . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the notion of being as ultimate act and is built on four basic concepts : ( 1 ) that of act , ( 2 ) that of the unicity of the substantial form , ( 3 ) that of the personal individuality of the human soul , and ( 4 ) that of the real distinction between essence and existence . ( 1 ) The concept of act signifies perfection in se and per se , and thus is prior to potency whether it is understood as potency or as form ? 33.2-4 . Act itself is thus the affirmation of being , whereas potency is the capacity to receive perfection . As a consequence ( a ) potency is not a univocal concept signifying primary matter ? 16.3 alone , but an analogical concept embracing all the ways a thing can be a subject of act , andu(b) primary matter , being exclusively a subject , can have no act of its own : not even an omnipotent being could make such matter exist without form . ( 2 ) Since act confers being , which comes through form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial form ? 16.4 ; rather than admit the possibility of a plurality of forms , Aquinas insisted on the unicity of the substantial form in each substance ( 5:1024c ) . In the case of man , who performs vegetative and sensitive functions as well as rational , the intellectual soul is his unique substantial form , and this , including lower // forms virtually through its powers ? 22.7 , controls all his lower functions also . ( 3 ) The human soul is personal and individual ? ? 29 , 34 , and has an immaterial esse proper to it and inseparable from it , which accounts for its immortality ? 29.4 . Again , esse properly belongs to form , which is act , and it is impossible that a form be separated from itself ; therefore a subsistent form can not cease to be . ( 4 ) In all substances that come under man 's experience , including man himself , there is a real distinction between essence and existence or esse ? 33.6 . But essence is itself a subject , a potentiality for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a received perfection , and he is only a being by participation . Moreover , since being or esse is the first perfection and the act of all acts , man and all other beings that are such by participation must receive their being from a being that is pure perfection . But pure perfection can not be anything but unique , since it offers no basis for being individuated or multiplied . It must therefore be a subsisting being whose essence is to be . This subsistent being itself ( ipsum esse subsistens ) is being by essence ( per essentiam ) ; all others are being by participation ( per participationem ) . 3 . The explication of the foregoing analysis entails the entire development of natural theology , viz , the proofs for the existence of ipsum esse subsistens , the determination of the divine nature and attributes , and the complexity of the many relationships of that nature to other beings . For the moment it will suffice to spell out some of the implications of this doctrine of participation for the analogy of being ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has already been noted ? 31.6 , may be expressed as a proportion , e.g. , accidents are to their being as substance is to its being . Despite the radical difference between substance and accident , there is a proportional similarity that allows one , predicate , " is , " to be said of both analogically . The basis of this proportional similarity , as has also been noted ? 34.3 , is that accidents participate in the esse of substance . Thus , while the formal structure of this kind of analogy simply states relations of similarity , its root is actual dependence and participation . The dependence and participation of accidental being on the being of // substance , moreover , does nothing to prejudice the fact that all beings , substances and accidents as well , have their esse by participation from ipsum esse subsistens . But the formal or static analogy of proportionality , without mentioning such dependencies , serves to explain how beings obtain the proper consistency of esse , each in its own way , since each being is actuated by the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal or static analogy of proportions , the analogy of intrinsic attribution ? 31.6 is dynamic in that it is based explicitly on causality and dependency . To extend the example of the existence of substance and accidents to that of subsistent being , esse belongs properly to ipsum esse subsistens alone , but it is predicated of other beings because they receive their esse in dependence on subsistent being itself . Such analogy is called intrinsic attribution because each being really does have esse intrinsically , even though it is from another . Again , the accident has its inesse , even though this is dependent on the esse of substance . Despite this " inner " or intrinsic aspect , however , whenever analogy of attribution is used it also emphasizes the " otherness " of the characteristic participated . Accidents are beings by participation in the esse of substance , and all beings are such by participation in the esse of subsistent being . In this way the analogy of proper proportionality can be seen to be related to , and to presuppose , the analogy of intrinsic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both allows subsistent being to be transcendent or " other , " when compared to other beings , and at the same time it allows esse to be participated and thus to be immanent or " within " other beings . So the doctrine of participation can cast light on the analogy of being , and in doing this explain how immanence and transcendence can be applied to being itself ? ? 38.2 , 44.1 , 45.4. ? 43 . PROOFS OF GOD 'S EXISTENCE 1 . The argument implicit in ? 42.2 can be cast in the form of an a posteriori demonstration ? 12.5 of the existence of an un127 THE // caused cause ( 14:62a ) . The middle term of this demonstration is an effect , the act of existing of the beings of experience or the esse of material , sensible things , and the demonstration concludes to the existence of their proper cause . Granted that middle term , the proof proceeds thus . " Whatever belongs to a being is either caused by the principles of its nature or comes to be from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existing ( esse ) be caused by a thing 's form or essence or quiddity , for then something would be the cause of itself and would bring itself into existence ? which is impossible . Everything , then , which is such that its act of existing is other than its nature must needs have its act of existing from something else . And since every being that exists through another is reduced , as to its first cause , to one existing in virtue of itself , there must be some being that is the cause of the existing of all things , because it itself is the act of existing alone . " In sum , if the act of existing can not come from the nature of any being as from its source , it follows that the act of existing must come from a cause whose nature it is to be . 2 . Note that the word God does not appear either in ? 42.2 or in the foregoing demonstration . This defect can be easily remedied by substituting " God " for ipsum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself " in the respective arguments . Such a substitution is commonly made in books on natural theology , and its basis usually is the Catholic teaching that God can be proved to exist by the resources of reason alone , and therefore in philosophy . There is nothing objectionable in this procedure , provided that it be noted that the identification of Subsistent Being or First Cause with the God of Revelation is , from the point of view of philosophy , a pre-supposition . ( The pre-supposition may be known to be tiue by faith , or it may be provable in theology , but either source is outside the pale of philosophy . ) Somewhat more objectionable is a procedure that is frequently adopted in the name of Christian philosophy ? 1.8 , namely , to maintain that the Christian experience of God is a valid basis for philosophy and therefore should be frankly admitted from the outset . On this basis the philosophical proof for God 's existence must lead ultimately to the Biblical concept of God as " He Who // Is . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify Ipsum Esse Subsistens with the " I Am Who Am " of Exodus . The difference between this and the first procedure is that a religious assumption is here made explicit , whereas in the first procedure it is only implicit ; in either case it is difficult to see , however , how the resulting demonstration can remain purely philosophical cf. ? 47.3. 3 . On the supposition that the existence of the God of Revelation is proved in natural theology , the word God will be used here ( and hereafter ) in discoursing on the existence and nature of the divine being . Proofs for the existence of God , in this context , are understood as answers to the question : Does God exist ? What is required , therefore , is a proof rising from effect to cause . The conclusion of the proof is a proposition , " God exists , " wherein " God " is the subject and " exists " is the predicate . In such a proof the middle term of the demonstration is a nominal definition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term " God " means . The proofs most commonly developed are those employed by Aquinas in his Summa theologiae , where they are known as the quinque viae or " five ways " ( 6:563b ) . In these ways a different nominal definition is employed for each , respectively : ( 1 ) God is a First Unmoved Mover , ( 2 ) God is an Uncaused First Cause , ( 3 ) God is a First Necessary Being , ( 4 ) God is a Most Perfect Being , and ( 5 ) God is the Governor of the Universe . Under these nominal definitions are subsumed minor premises stating that a being corresponding to each ( or one , or more , or all ) of the definitions so stated exist(s) . The burden of the proof(s) consists in establishing the second , or minor premise , and this is done through an analysis of the dependencies found in the beings of experience , dependencies that the definitions themselves suggest . So each starts from an existential fact given directly in experience , namely , ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( 3 ) corruptibility , ( 4 ) composition and imperfection , and ( 5 ) finality , and then argues to the existence of the ultimate cause or explanation of that particular datum as expressed in the corresponding definition . ( The essential contents of the first way and the fourth way have already been sketched in // ? 20 and in ? 43.1 respectively ; for details of each way , see 6 : 563b568c . ) The conclusion in each case signifies God under all these " names , " and from its implications the rest of the philosophical discoveries about the divine nature and attributes are derived , as will be explained presently ? 44. 4 . Other formulations of proofs for the existence of God are known as the ontological , the ideological , and the cosmological arguments respectively . ( 1 ) The ontological argument ( 10 : 699b ) has been presented in various ways : one variety would reason that , from the concept of God , who is a being greater than which none can be conceived , his existence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually existed , he would not be a being greater than which none can be conceived . A related argument , though not strictly ontological , would maintain that an idea that one has of the infinite can not be caused by finite things , but only by an infinite being , which therefore exists . Yet another argument would maintain that man 's natural knowledge of God is direct and intuitive ( 6 : 562c ) and so God 's existence is self-evident to all . None of these arguments has received broad acceptance among philosophers ; the usual claim against them is that they malke an illicit passage from the logical to the real order . ( ( 2 ) The ideological argument ( 6:552b ) is similar to the ontological , but is based on intelligibles such as eternal truths and possible essences , and may be stated as follows . There are intrinsically possible beings whose essence and essential principles are necessary , immutable , and eternal ; but such beings demand as their ultimate foundation an actually existing being that is absolutely necessary , immutable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this argument has validity , it would seem to be as a development and refinement of Aquinas ' fourth way . ( 3 ) The cosmological argument ( 16:105d ) is any type of reasoning whereby one argues from observable aspects of the universe , or cosmos , to the existence of God . The reasoning is explicitly a posteriori and thus the reverse of that of the ontological argument . Though used in the singular , the term actually refers to several arguments , the number depending on the particular observable aspects of the universe that are taken as starting points of the proofs . So // Aquinas ' first three ways , and particularly the third , are commonly regarded as cosmological . Some would include the fifth way also , as arguing from the fact of design in the cosmos to the existence of a Supreme Intelligence who has planned and guides the universe in its complex processes ; others would make of this a special proof that invokes finality or teleology and so more aptly label it the teleological argument ? 69.5. 5 . Subsidiary evidences that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include arguments from ( 1 ) moral obligation or conscience , ( 2 ) the need for sanctions , ( 3 ) man 's desire for happiness , and ( 4 ) the universal consensus of mankind ( 6:551c-552a ) . ( 1 ) Man perceives within himself a law commanding him to do certain acts because they are good and avoid others because they , are evil ; since there is no law without a lawgiver , such a natural law owes its origin to a supreme lawgiver , God , as the author of human nature . ( 2 ) Since perfect justice and adequate rewards and punishments as sanctions for the observance of the natural Law are not found in this life , there must be a future life where adequate justice is done by a supremely wise and all-powerful judge , namely , God . ( 3 ) Man is so constituted that he always strives for happiness but never completely attains it ; since this tendency can not be fully satisfied in this life , where all goods arc limited and imperfect , a supreme good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is God . ( 4 ) The human race as a whole has always recognized the existence of a superior Being on whom man and the world depend ; but mankind and the human mind can not be universally wrong in a matter of such importance ; therefore God must exist . All four of these arguments , it may be noted , lack the cogency of the traditional metaphysical proofs , but by and large they have greater appeal to the philosophically untrained and deserve attention in view of their persuasive force . // ? 44 . GOD 'S ESSENCE AND ATTRIBUTES 1 . The proofs for God 's existence , each in its own way , lead one to knowledge of God as first on all levels of existence , as Ipsum Esse Subsistens . There now remains the task of making explicit what is implicitly contained in that concept ( 6:556d ) . One may well wonder to what extent explicit knowledge of this kind is possible . God is transcendent , and though man can " name " him , he clearly can not comprehend him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genus would be being , and yet being is not a genus , since no specific difference can be added to it that is not already included in its concept ? 31.4 . But this does not mean that man can know nothing of God by reason alone : he can know God philosophically , if only in an imperfect way . To attain such knowledge two means are available to him , negation and eminence . 2 . The way of negation ( via negationis ) consists in denying of God anything that belongs to a contingent being as such . On this account to know God through this way is not to show what he is , but rather what he is not cf. ? 20.5 . Instead of beginning with an inaccessible essence to which are added positive differences leading to better and better understanding , one collects rather a series of negative differences that indicate what this essence is not . The resulting knowledge is imperfect in the sense that it is not positive : God is known , e.g. , as incorporeal , immatefial , immutable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limitations found in creatures , it allows one to say with ever greater precision what God is not and what he can not possibly be ' So , by distinguishing God from what is not God , one attains some knowledge of his essence . 3 . The way of eminence ( via eminentiae ) or of analogy consists in attributing to God in an eminent degree everything that can be considered a perfection pure and simple , i.e. , a perfection that is without trace of imperfection . To describe the nature of God is to name him variously as just , powerful , wise , etc . The principle behind such predication is this : because God is First Cause , he must possess to an eminent degree all the per ? // fections found in creatures . The problem is to discover how these perfections may be predicated of God . It is here that the teaching on analogy proves important , particularly the analogy of proper proportionality ? ? 31.6 , 42.3 . This kind of analogy permits one to say , for example , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relationship to the divine nature as intelligence does to human nature . In other words , it can express a parallel or proportional relationship between divine nature and divine intelligence on the one hand , and between human nature and human intelligence on the other . Note that such a relationship must be stated in the form of a strict proportion : a perfection that is realized in a finite being to the degree consonant with its proper mode of being is similar to that found in God according to his mode of being . Such an analogy , as has been seen , is legitimated by the foregoing analysis of participation ? 42.3 : since any being or perfection that can be assigned to a creature must have its root in God , any perfection that denotes a positive reality in creatures ( e.g. , life , intelligence , will , justice , wisdom ) must be found also in God . Consequently , one can not remove from God the positive value of this perfection , no matter what the form ( or lack of form ) it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnishes a basis for understanding what is meant by a divine attribute . In general , a divine attribute may be defined as an absolutely simple perfection that exists in God necessarily and formally , and that , according to man 's imperfect mode of knowing , either constitutes the essence of the Divine Being or is deduced from this essence . Divine attributes that do not constitute the divine essence are further divided into entitative attributes ? 45 and operative attributes ? 46 . Entitative attributes relate to the very being of God ; they are perfections such as unicity , truth , goodness , infinity , immensity , simplicity , and eternity that in themselves bespeak no relation to contingent being . Operative attributes , on the other hand , relate to the divine operations , i.e. , to the immanent operations of God 's intellect and will , from which proceed effects that are extrinsic to God , namely , creation and conservation ? 47. 5 . The divine attributes do not designate perfections really // distinct from one another ; rather there is only a distinction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explicitly states what is implied in the others ? 10.6 . All the divine attributes designate one and the same , absolutely unique , Entity , but as understood under multiple and diverse intelligible contents : hence the distinction between them is that of reason reasoned about ? 10.8 . Moreover , such multiplicity does not impair the divine perfection , because if God appears to human reason as simultaneously one and many , this is owing only to the limitations of man 's intellect . 6 . Among the divine attributes it is possible to isolate one or more that can be said to be the formal constituent of the divine essence . This manner of speaking refers only to a logical determination of the divine essence , for in God all reality is his very essence . The formal constituent , in this sense , is the fundamental perfection from which all others can be demonstrated . Such a perfection must appear to man as absolutely first , prior to any other attribute , and should be the basis for his distinguishing God from what is not God . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction of divine attributes , propter quid demonstrations ? 12.4 in natural theology do not assign the cause of a particular attribute , but rather a prior reason that is only rationally distinct from the attribute it serves to explain . 7 . It is commonly taught that God is Being Itself , subsistent by itself , and that this aseitas , anglicized as as.eity ( 1:94513 ) , or " by-itself-ness , " is the constitutive perfection of God . Aseity is fundamental , for God 's basic perfection consists in being absolutely independent , self-sufficient , and self-existent . Everything else is said of God precisely because he exists of himself . The perfection of aseity , furthermore , properly belongs to God and distinguishes him clearly from creatures . Though all other divine perfections can be imitated analogically , only existence of himself is absolutely proper to God . Finally , it can be said that the divine attributes are implied in the other only because each contains being . Infinity , for example , implies intelligence , eternity , etc. , because infinity is nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed Ipsum Esse Subsistens , // " He Who Is , " the Being in whom essence and existence are one . It should be noted , however , that this teaching on aseity is not universally accepted , for some hold that infinity itself is the formal constituent of the divine essence , others that subsistent intellection or intelligence is the perfection in God ( as in man ) upon which all others depend cf. ? 46.1-2. ? 45 . ENTITATIVE ATTRIBUTES 1 . Among the attributes relating to the very being of God , simplicity and infinity give man direct knowledge of God 's personal nature and also can serve to cast light on his other entitative attributes . By the simplicity of God ( 13:229d ) is meant the attribute whereby he is absolutely one in himself and perfectly simple , that is to say , it excludes any composition from him , whether physical , metaphysical , or logical . ( 1 ) Since God is Pure Act ( 11:1031b ) he can not , on the physical level , be composed of matter and form ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperfection . A fortiori he is not composed of quantitative parts ? 9.5 , since these indicate indetermination and passivity . ( 2 ) On the metaphysical level , God can not be composed of essence and existence ? 33.5 , since he is Being of himself ( Esse per se ) ; neither can he be composed of substance and accident ? 34 , since he is fully act and thus not in potency to further determination . Lacking composition at both the physical and the metaphysical level , God can not change in any way ; this changeless and unchangeable character is what is expressed in the attribute of the immutability of God ( 7:393b ) . ( 3 ) On the logical level , God is not contained in a genus or a species ? 8.3 because , as universal principle , he transcends all genera and all differences of being . 2 . The unicity of God ( 14 : 394b ) is a necessary result of the absolutely divine simplicity . If divinity were multiple , one would have to distinguish , in divine beings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences . In consequence , one would find in these beings a composition of genus and differ. - // ences ; thus , no one of them could be termed Ipsum Esse Subsistens and no one would be God . Moreover , since God is his very nature he has no reason to multiply himself . If a man were what he is by reason of human nature rather than by reason of the individuation that distinguishes him from other men ? 19.6 , he would be humanity itself ; thus , there could be no other men besides him . The same reasoning applies to God : he is his very nature , thus there can be only one God . 3 . Infinity ( 7:504c ) means the same as " without limits . " But there are different ways of being without limits . Thus , matter and motion are infinite in a privative sense , they can not be completed by themselves ? 18.81 ; in this sense infinity connotes indefiniteness or basic indetermination , and therefore essential imperfection . In a contrary sense , the infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its very perfection . From this point of view , one can distinguish ( 1 ) the relative infinite , which has no limits within the genus of a certain perfection , and ( 2 ) the absolute infinite , which has no limits within the genus of all perfections possible . It is the latter infinity of perfection that is attributed to God when one speaks of the infinity of God ( 7:508b ) . In fact , God is infinitely perfect insofar as he is Esse per se , and for this reason can be spoken of as divine perfection ( 11:124c ) itself . In him , existence is not received as in an essence capable of existing ; God is unreceived , and therefore absolutely unlimited-existence . Alternatively , if God had limitations he would be susceptible to some new perfection ; he would be composed of act and potency , which is a contradiction , for then he could not be Pure Act . God is therefore infinite by his essence and with the fullness of infinity , which implies the total and perfect actuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God are his eternity and his immensity or omnipresence . By the eternity of God ( 5:565c ) is meant his duration , different from that of time and without beginning or end , and thus a direct consequence of his complete interminability and immutability . By his omnipresence ( 10 : 689c ) is meant that God is immanent in all things everywhere ; this is // not to be understood in the sense of a dimensional or spatial presence , since God is utterly simple and infinite , and thus free of all spatial limitations . Rather he is present as an agent is in his effects . In light of this it is preferable , when discussing entitative attributes , to speak of God 's immensity rather than his omnipresence : immensity is the infinite plenitude of subsistent being that is free from all spatial limitations and so is able to be present in all things . Omnipresence , as opposed to this , is the actual exercise of that ability to be everywhere . Since omnipresence , in this sense , is said relative to created being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? 46 . OPERATIVE ATTRIBUTES 1 . The operative attributes refer to God 's immanent operations , or , in other words , to the divine life ( 8:738b ) as this is known to natural reason . Main consideration is given here to God 's intellect and will , for these attributes enable one to conceive of God as a personal being and also to understand the effects that proceed from him to creatures . The divine intelligence , also known as God 's omniscience ( 10:690a ) , can be deduced from his infinite perfection and supreme actuality . Since God possesses all perfections to an absolute degree , science , the perfection of the intellect , is his first operative attribute ; as such it specifies the divine nature , which is the principle of divine operation . ( In this sense nature ? 17 is the source of a being 's operations , whereas essence ? 33.5 is its definition considered in itself ; the two , as has been seen , are only rationally distinct ? 34.2 by a distinction of reason reasoning . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluding all potentiality . Now knowledge is proportionate to the degree of immateriality ? 23.3 , and a being is intelligent to the degree that its being is pure . God , the Pure Spirit , therefore possesses supreme and absolute knowledge . Furthermore , since the act of knowing is essentially immanent ? 22.1 , and since whatever is in God is the divine essence , divine intelligence is identified with the // divine essence ; it is , properly speaking , subsistent intellection. 2 . To say that divine intelligence is subsistent intellection is to affirm that God understands himself perfectly , that he is Thought Thinking Itself . Knowing that the degree of a being 's intelligibility increases with its immateriality , one may conclude that any being that is fully immaterial is fully intelligible . In God the supreme degree of knowledge and the ultimate degree of intelligibility merge within his essence . Again , to know a thing perfectly is to be fully aware of its power , and consequently , to grasp fully the effects to which this power extends ? 46.8 . In knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his essence , which he understands to be imitable to different degrees of participation . He knows all singular beings , since whatever shares in being finds its origins in himself as Ipsum Esse Subsistens. 3 . To clarify further the field of objects comprehended by divine knowledge , one may inquire whether God knows ( 1 ) possibles , that is to say , things that do not actually exist but can exist ( 11:627d ) , and ( 2 ) future contingents , namely , the things that can be made to exist or not , at will ( 4:266b ) . ( 1 ) As to the first type of objects , it is commonly held that since God is the source of all existence , and knows everything that exists , whatever the kind of existence it may possess , he does know possibles. ( 2 ) The teaching with regard to contingents is more complicated . Since God is by nature outside of time ? 19.4 , his knowledge bespeaks a relation to eternity ( 5 : 563c ) . Now eternity embraces all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows future contingents as actually present and realized ; yet the necessity ( 10:292a ) of God 's knowledge of them does not in any way affect their contingent character . ( For a discussion of God 's knowledge of the future and its relation to man 's freedom and predestination , see 10 : 692a694d ) . 4 . From the fact that God has intellection in the highest degree , one may conclude that he also has volition , commonly known as the will of God ( 14:914a ) . Indeed , since the good as known constitutes the proper object of the will , once any // good becomes known it must also come to be desired ; thus , a being that knows the good must be endowed with a will . Now God , as perfectly intelligent , knows being under its formality of goodness ; from the very fact that he so knows , he also wills . And just as God 's intellect is identical with his essence , so too is his will , since he wills insofar as he is intelligent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the object of the will is the good as apprehended by the intellect and since the divine intellect apprehends the divine essence directly , this essence is in consequence the primary object of God 's will . Further , every being endowed with a will naturally tends to communicate to others the good it possesses . But if natural beings communicate to others their own proper good , with greater reason does the divine will communicate its perfection to others , to the extent that such perfection is communicable . To say this is to assert that God loves all being , for love ' ( 8:1039b ) is nothing other than the first movement of the will in its tendency toward the good . Again , for God to love his creatures is for him to love himself . For creatures possess goodness only to a degree proportionate to their being , i.e. , a degree that corresponds to their perfection . 6 . Thus is God 's freedom ( 6:99a ) manifested . In fact , God is supremely free : on the one hand , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the absolute good is sufficient unto itself ; on the other hand , God is free regarding the means he uses to achieve the goals of his infinite wisdom . One could say that God is bound only by his science , by his wisdom , and by the natural necessity ( 10:292a ) of things . God 's science and wisdom , however , are not something foreign or superior to him , for they are his very self . In like manner , the natural necessity of things can not limit God 's liberty , for this necessity flows from his perfection and from his free decision . God is therefore not only supremely free , he is freedom , for this also is his very being . 7 . The divine intellect and will are the source of God 's operations with respect to creatures : primary among these is the act , which pertains both to his intellection and to his volition , // whereby he causes , cares for , and directs all creatures to their particular ends , in attaining which each one contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the providence of God ( 11:917b ) . This act , like all else in God , is infinite and eternal , not limited and temporal . It exists in God 's intelligence and presupposes his will , yet it is not multiple or successive , but one simple act identified with his essence . God is the first cause of all things , and in causing them he also disposes them to the end that he intends ; again , since everything is eternally in him , he cares for them immediately also . This is the meaning of providence in the strict sense . The execution of God 's plan , of course , takes place in time , and this is usually known by another name , viz , divine governance ? ? 48.8 , 54.4. 8 . The power or active potency in God whereby he operates in things is known as the divine omnipotence ( 10:688c ) . By this power God has dominion over all things other than himself ; by it he confers existence on them and also continues to hold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pure Act , having within himself the fullness of actuality . Since one thing is able to cause another insofar as it itself is in act , God alone is capable of giving existence to created things . Like all other divine attributes , God 's omnipotence is in reality completely identified with his essence . It extends to everything that does not involve a contradiction , i.e. , that has the inherent possibility of existence . So God can not make a square circle , not because his power is limited , but because there is an inherent limitation , in this case a contradiction , in the idea of the thing itself . ? 47 . DIVINE CAUSALITY 1 . God , however conceived by those who speak of him , is generally regarded in some way as the cause of the world . The divine causality ( 3:347a ) has in fact been expressed in terms of all four causes , pantheists seeing God as immanent in and identical with the world , others seeing him as an extrinsic source // affecting the universe through efficient causality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , including matter ; he is the exemplar ? 35.11 above whom there is no further model ; and he is the final cause of all ( 6:514d ) . Every being apart from God must come from him , for God is Subsistent Esse ; esse is uniquely an effect of God , and therefore all other beings must participate in esse from him . In light of this truth one gains an insight into the meaning of God as Ipsum Esse Subsistens and the implications of this concept for an understanding of divine causality . In what follows attention will be restricted to philosophical problems associated with God 's influence as the agent , or efficient cause ? 35.8 of the existence and activity of his creation and the relationship of secondary causes to his primary causality . Here God 's causality , as productive , is required on three counts : the initial production of the universe , the conservation of all things in their existence , and the actual exercise of causality by all agent causes . 2 . Creation ( 4:417c ) is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , i.e. , from no subject that exists anteriorly . This total production is not a necessary emanation ( 5:291d ) ; rather it is a free act accomplished by the divine fiat . It is not eternal but takes place in time . The implications of this for clarifying what is meant by God 's own perfection and causality are many . The very being of things is conferred on them from God as from a primal source ; whereas there formerly was God and nothing else , other beings suddenly began to exist . God as the source is the fullness of being : his own as unreceived , limitless being ; the being of all else as an effect that he produces . Thus what the divine causality explains is the very fact of existence . This means that God alone is the first and proper cause of esse . It means that the divine causality does not work physically on pre-existent matter , that God 's causality does not require his physical contact or his complete immanence in creation . Rather this causality is a pure communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its effects without being itself perfected or changed in any way . On the other hand , the creature is totally dependent on such divine causality ; // this dependence makes all the difference between its existing and its not existing . 3 . It should be noted here that it was the concept of creation that enabled Aquinas to see the full import of God 's being the unique Subsistent Esse , to appreciate the subordination of all creation to him in being and in action , and so to develop his distinctive teaching on being as esse and on God as " He Who Is . " Apparently , therefore , it was only with the revelation of Moses , including the fact of creation and its taking place in time , that the tentative insights of philosophers such as Aristotle actually received their full understanding and application . This explains why some insist ? 104.3 that natural theology in its full elaboration must rightly be seen as a Christian philosophy ? ? 1.8 , 43.2. 4 . Since esse is the proper effect of God , wherever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effect , and one that God alone can produce . Every existent , as a consequence , actually and continually depends on God . This continuation of creation is known as divine conservation ( 4:212c ) . Any effect that is dependent on its cause not only for its coming-to-be but also for its actual being is continually dependent on such a cause . All creatures , because they exist and for as long , as they exist , actually and continually receive their existence from God . 5 . The teaching that esse is the proper effect of God need not entail a rejection of creatural causality . The production of creatures should be understood as the communication of being in various and limited ways . Since God willed to create , his creatures must be limited and can not themselves be Subsistent Being . Their limitation is in their essence , which is made to be actualized by esse ; in this way God is the cause of the entire being of his creatures . But the perfection of the divine causality precisely as communicative embraces the production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former can contribute actively to the development of creatures , whereas the others can not . Stated somewhat differently , God makes at least some things to be efficient causes . 6 . Not only does God 's causality not eliminate the causality // of secondary causes , but rather it causes them to be themselves causes actually causing . Efficient causality ? 35.8 is always the active communication of existence to an effect . Because esse is the proper effect of God , every other agent in causing must participate in the influence of divine causality . Not only does it do this in view of its essence and its power to operate , received initially from God , but also in actual subordination to God 's influx in the very exercise of its causality . The power actually to share in God 's proper causality is communicated as , a passing force , one that can be received only transiently and subordinately to God . But it is this power that is the ultimate completion of every created cause and renders it capable of actually causing . Only through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , thus functioning on its own level of causality . The completion of its power to cause enables it to make its effect exist , since it communicates esse , the ultimate actuality of all perfections . The particular kind of existence is made actual by esse , and the power received from God to enter into this communication makes the secondary cause actually the cause of its own effect . Because this ultimate power derives from its subordination to God , both God and the secondary causes are total causes of the entire reality of the effect : God as primary , the created agent as secondary , cause ? 35.8-9. 7 . Aquinas explains the subordination of secondary causes to God by teaching also that God " applies " the power of the secondary cause to its exercise . This point has become the occasion of controversy among theologians dealing with the problems of grace , free-will , and predestination ? 95.7 . Aquinas means simply that God applies all causes to their actual operation because they are moved movers and he is the First Mover ? 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependence of the creature , as composed of essence and existence , on the unique Subsistent Esse . It is because , in their ontological structure as substances , created causes are so composed that they can not be identical with their own operation . Their exercise of operation is the acquisition of a new accidental esse to which , as created , // they are merely in potency . This potentiality can not be actualized unless through the intervention of God , who is First Mover and Pure Act precisely because he is Ipsum Esse Subsistens . The communication of motion by God , called by some a premotion ( 11:741b ) or a predetermination ( 11:722b ) and by others a concursus or concurrence ( 4:125a ) , is not the bestowal of a reality distinct from the transient power by which the created agent participates in the production of else . It is simply another facet of the dependence of creatural causality on God 's causality . ? 48 . THE PROBLEM OF EVIL 1 . In explaining the rightness and goodness of the divine causality as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being , it becomes necessary to treat of the problem of evil . If God exists , whence comes evil ? How is it possible to explain that an infinitely good and wise God has , if not willed , at least caused ( and as primary cause at that ) so much evil in the world ? Since he is all-powerful , could he not have prevented the existence of such evil ? These questions , which are among the most difficult to answer in all of philosophy , pose the problem of evil . To respond to them it will be convenient to treat of the nature and kinds of evil , the subject of evil , and the causality involved in its production . 2 . Evil ( 5:665b ) is opposed to good ? 32.4 , which is the integrity or perfection of being in all orders : material , moral , and spiritual . Evil is sometimes taken concretely as the thing that is evil , i.e. , the subject affected by evil ; at other times it is taken formally or abstractly to designate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a negation of the perfection due to a nature or to a being . As such , however , it is not a simple negation ; rather evil consists in a privation ? 16.5 i.e. , in the fact that a certain being lacks a good it requires to enjoy the integrity of its nature . While this implies that evil is non-being , it does not imply that evil is non-existent . Blindness truly exists , but to say // that " Peter is blind " is not to attribute blindness to him as a thing possessed ; the predicate here does not signify being , but simply the reality of a lack or of a defect . 3 . There are many kinds of evil : a common division is that into ( 1 ) metaphysical , ( 2 ) physical , and ( 3 ) moral . ( 1 ) Metaphysical evil is associated by some philosophers with the mere finitude of created beings , i.e. , the absence of a perfection not required for the natural integrity of creatures . This usage is generally regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is indeed the negation of a higher perfection , in the sense that a dog is not a man , but this is not as a privation , since a dog is not deprived of the perfections proper to a man . ( 2 ) Physical evil is that affecting a nature , whether this be corporeal or spiritual , whose integrity it alters . Pain ( malum poenae ) and sorrow are physical evils , as are psychoses and neuroses , in that they deprive the soul of its natural equilibrium , just as blindness deprives the body of its natural integrity . Cataclysms such as earthquakes and epidemics are sometimes listed as physical evils , although this again is not a proper usage ; evil rather lies in the physical defects and suffering , often great and terrible , that accidentally follow in the wake of such phenomena . ( 3 ) Moral evil ( malum culpae ) consists essentially in the disorder of the will , and is called fault or sin ( 13:241a ) . This is the primary evil in the universe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 48.6. 4 . Since evil is a privation it can exist only in a subject or in a being that , as such , is good . Evil presupposes good , both as the subject that it affects and as the perfection that it negates . From this point of view evil can never be total or absolute ; if it were a denial of the subject in its totality , evil would annihilate itself for lack of something to affect . Negation or non-being can not exist as such ; they can only " exist " in some being that is good in itself and whose integrity they limit or alter . 5 . The subject of physical evil is the material universe in general , but especially living beings who are able to undergo physical or moral suffering . A wine may go sour , or a subsnance may turn out to be a poison , but properly speaking evil is not // in such things ; it is man who classifies them or makes them evil because of his needs or the uses he puts them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical evil , though it affects men and animals differently . Man is able to suffer more than animals because he is aware of his suffering , and this serves to intensify the evil . The problem becomes particularly acute in the context of death , for man alone knows that he will die and is capable of anguish as he faces death . Yet even death is not an absolute evil , for the soul survives the body and all its defects ; should a person , on the other hand , not believe in an afterlife , then death takes away the problem : the evil annihilates itself in its very realization . 6 . In contrast to physical evil , moral evil is found in a rational and free nature as such . Properly the soul is its immediate subject , or , more precisely , the will , with its power of obeying or disobeying the norms of conscience and the natural law ? 54 . Moral evil is therefore a privation of rectitude required by the natural law , a privation affecting a free will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have . Physical evil , as has been seen , is always an evil suffered , whether this affegts a corporeal or a spiritual nature ; moral evil , just the opposite , results from the voluntary activity of an agent who , in depriving himself of a perfection to which he is obliged by nature , inflicts upon himself a self-mutilation . Moral evil is thus properly constituted by this very activity . Being a voluntary privation , a refusal to enter here and now on the path to right action for the purpose of a good that is not the good , evil is a consequence of freedom . Such a " negative positivity , " such placing of a refusal or a negation , makes the will disordered and defines evil properly so-called . 7 . God is not and can not be in any way the cause of evil , for he is infinite goodness and desires only to communicate good . Yet in the physical order there are undeniably pain and suffering , and were these to no good purpose they would be unmitigated evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even these to the good and to the happiness of man ; in other words , he permits such evils so that out of them a greater good may come . // Seen in this way they do not merit being called evil in the strict sense , since from this perspective they are not privations , but rather accidental negations of a greater good , namely , the spiritual good of man . Moral evil presents more of a problem . As we have seen , it results ultimately from the fallible liberty of a free agent 08.6 . Is God to be reproached for the gift of free-will because this turns out to be fallible ? It would seem not , for freewill is undeniably a perfection . And even if man makes ill use of his freedom , God is still good in giving him this perfection . For it is a perfection to possess self-determination , to conform the self by a decision of the will to the order desired by God , and thus to collaborate in God 's creative activity . Moreover , fallibility can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its reality is absolutely contingent and has no other cause than the free decision of an intelligent agent . In this sense , evil itself has no per se cause ; to search for a cause is to postulate an antecedent evil , and hence to institute an unending inquiry . Voluntary evil is therefore a sort of absolute : the primary negation and refusal of a liberty , which is such only because of the mysterious power of refusal and negation . 8 . God 's providence governs the whole of the created order as well as its parts . Proceeding from the infinite knowledge of God and from his absolutely perfect will , it never takes on a capricious aspect but acts always in a way consonant with the nature of each creature . Therefore , in reference to man , this action will respect man 's freedom , even his power of refusal . Granted that God has given man freedom , in a sense he is powerless to take that freedom away , just as he is powerless to make a square circle . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God is the primary cause of the being of the act . The disordination or privation of rectitude in the act that constitutes its sinfulness , however , comes not from God but from the sinner , whose choice it uniquely is ? 50.6-8 . Because of God 's respect for human nature and its prerogative of freedom , evil thus insinuates itself in the plan of providence . God allows evil to enter into this order ? not as essential to order , since evil is not directly willed by him ? but accidentally , in virtue of the needs of mercy , // of wisdom , and of divine power . God , as has been said , makes suffering serve a purpose , and even in the case of moral evil he offers the sinner the possibility of good . For by sin , man can know his misery , acknowledge his dependence on God , and will to seek his help . This too is the greater good . In any event , divine providence and governance can not be blamed for the evil in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no injustice . 9 . At a philosophical level , one can not penetrate into the intimacies of the divine nature or the mysteries of the divine plan . It would seem that the more man penetrates into the infinite , the better he understands that it is beyond him . What little he knows of God by his natural reason can therefore be but a small fraction of all there is to know . And yet man 's intellect , in its philosophical search , neither destroys nor diminishes the mystery , but rather serves to deepen it . This , it would appear , is sufficient justification for his intellectual efforts : the wisdom he attains by ever deeper and deeper reflection is itself a springboard to higher truth . CHAPTER 8 . ETHICS ? 49 . MORAL PHILOSOPHY 1 . Ethics ( 5:570c ) is the philosophical study of voluntary human action , with the purpose of determining what types of activity are good , right , and to be done , or bad , wrong , . and not to be done , so that man may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a science ? 13 or intellectual habit that treats information derived from man 's natural experience of the problems of human living , from the point of view of natural reasoning . The term ethics is etymologically connected with the Greek ethos , meaning custom or conduct , and is equivalent in meaning to moral philosophy , which is similarly connected with the Latin mores , meaning customs or behavior . It is generally regarded as a practical science ? 13.6 , in the sense that the objective of the study is not simply to know , but to know which actions should be done . and which should be avoided , so as properly to translate knowledge into action . 2 . The subject of ethics is voluntary human conduct ; this includes all actions , and also omissions , over which man exercises personal control , because he understands and wills these actions ( and omissions ) in relation to some end he has in view . Included within the scope of ethics , however , are somewhat involuntary activities that are performed with repugnance yet involve a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ethics is a reflective , well-considered , and reasonable set of conclusions concerning the kinds of voluntary activities that may be judged good or suitable ( or evil and unsuitable ) for a // human agent in the context of man 's life as a whole , including his relations to other beings whom his actions influence in some significant way . It also includes the relation of human actions to some overall goal of living : the knowing and loving of the perfect good , the higher welfare of the person or of his society , happiness or pleasure , or some such highest end . 3 . The distinctive character of ethics may be seen by considering the various kinds of order that man can discern among beings and that require different habits of mind to be understood . ( 1 ) The habits of speculative philosophy , say , of natural philosophy ? 15 and metaphysics ? 30 , enable one to consider the order to be found among all real beings , apart from any effect of man 's activity . , ( 2 ) The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own thinking . ( 3 ) Similarly , the habit of art ? 58.1 enables him to order the production of useful or beautiful artifacts . ( 4 ) Finally , moral philosophy enables him to put order in his voluntary activities , i.e. , activities proceeding from man 's will according to the ordering of reason and so properly directed to an end . From this it can be seen that ethics is a practical or productive science and that it is also normative : it is concerned with what man " ought " to do , not merely with " how " lie operates . Although practical , however , it also has a speculative aspect , in the sense that action follows on being ( agere sequitur Lsse ) and that human actions are right when they are in conformity with . human nature . Thus ethics requires a knowledge of psychology ? 21 and metaphysics for its proper elaboration . Some thinkers , e.g. , Kant , claim that ethics is impossible unless one postulates man 's freedom , his immortality , and the existence of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppositions but truths already demonstrated in speculative philosophy . 4 . Like natural theology ? 41 , ethics encounters a problem in its relations with faith , for it can be argued that a moral science based on reason alone is an inadequate guide for the actual decisions of man 's life , neglecting as it must original sin and man 's de facto elevation to the supernatural order . Because of this some would propose a Christian ethics , similar to Chris151 THE // tian philosophy ? 1.8 generally , that would be subalternated to theology and thus provide a more adequate and practical guide to Christian living . Granted the value of such a mixed moral science , what will be developed here is an ethics based on the natural life of reason alone ; although incomplete , this provides a reasonable foundiltion on which a moral theology can later be built . ( The student should be warned , however , that many of the articles in the New Catholic Encyclopedia to which reference will be made intermingle theological and philosophical considerations , and thus special care is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 5 . Ethics can be divided in various ways . Some would make only the basic distinction between voluntary actions as they are related to the private good of the person , which would be the subject matter of individual ethics , and such actions as they are related to the common good ? 54.1 , which would count as the domain of social ethics ? 75.1 . Others would propose finer divisions on the basis of the scope of the good that is envisaged . Thus individual ethics deals with the private good ; domestic ethics with the good of the family ; political ethics with the common good of a society , state , or nation ; and international ethics with the broadest natural common good , that of mankind . In what follows main attention will be centered on individual ethics . Matters relating to social and political ethics will be considered in the chapters devoted to social ? 75 and political ? 81 philosophies . ? 50 . THE HUMAN ACT 1 . Since the subject of ethics is voluntary human activity , it is necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctively human act . A human act ( 7:206a ) is defined as an act that is performed only by a human being and so is proper to man ? 29 . Some acts that humans perform are done also by animals , e.g. , vegetative acts and acts of perception and of emotion . When a person does such acts they are called acts of man , // but not human acts . What makes an act performed by a human being be distinctively human is that it is voluntary in character , i.e. , an act in some way under the control or direction of the will , which is proper to man . A voluntary act proceeds either from the will itself , such as an act of love or of choice , called an act elicited from the will , or from some other power that can in some way be moved by the will , called an act imperated by the will . So an act of the intellect , of sense cognition , or of emotion , or an act of some bodily member as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperated sense . 2 . From the foregoing it is clear that there are principles from which the human act springs and which can aid in its understanding . These principles are either intrinsic , in the sense that they pertain in some way to man 's being , or they are extrinsic to man , such as law ? 54 , which as known can exert an influence on his voluntary activity . The intrinsic principles of human acts include the intellect , the will , and the sense appetites , and the habits , both virtues and vices , with which these powers of his soul can be endowed . Since the first three have already been treated under psychology ? ? 25-28 , only an exposition of habits and their various kinds need be given here . 3 . A habit ( 6:880d ) can be understood initially as a disposing of a power ? 21.7 to act in a determinate way . Man is able to perform a variety of acts through his various powers , but without the disposing influence of habit most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develops and strengthens a human power , enabling the power to operate more effectively and with more facility . So understood , a habit may be defined as a firm disposition ( 4:907b ) of a power to act in a determinate way . As the actualization of a power or potency it may be seen as a perfection . A habit , moreover , far from being merely mechanical in operation and somehow alien to good human action , actually enters into the performing of human acts so intrinsically that it may be regarded as a second nature : habit makes its distinctive act a kind of natural act just as a power is the first source of a natural act . 4 . The notion of habit as perfecting or bettering human // action is not in conflict with the division of habit into good and bad , that is , into virtue and vice . Any habit permits man to operate better than he otherwise would , but whether a habit is good or bad is a moral consideration , distinct from the psychological explanation of how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the distinction between virtue as a good habit and vice as a bad habit turns on whether the habit produces acts conducive to promoting man 's moral good or evil . Acts of virtue are those that are suitable to human nature , i.e. , they are acts habitually performed according to the rule of reason . Acts of vice are opposed to human nature inasmuch as they are habitually opposed to the direction of reason . More precisely , a virtue may be defined as a good habit by which one lives righteously , or , alternatively , as a habit inclining one to choose the relative mean between the extremes of excess and defect . Vice , as the contrary habit , would incline one to choose either of the extremes , both morally evil . 5 . The foregoing definitions apply primarily to the four cardinal virtues , viz , prudence , justice , temperance , and fortitude . In a broader sense , human virtues may be either intellectual or moral , depending on whether they perfect the intellect or the will , the two basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the human intellect either in its speculative dimension with the intellectual virtues of understanding ? 36.2 , science ? l3 , and wisdom ? 36.1 , or in its practical dimension with the habits of art ? 58.1 and prudence ? 54.7 , although the latter is also moral to the extent that it requires right appetite for its proper operation ? 55.6 . Good habits of desiring perfect the appetite , either the will by means of the virtue of justice ? 56.1 , or the sense appetites by means of the virtue of temperance ? 55.3 in the concupiscible appetite and the virtue of fortitude ? 55.4 in the irascible appetite . There will be corresponding vices for each of these virtues by way of contrary habits . 6 . An alternative exposition of the human act may be given by explaining how such an act is free . Here it becomes necessary to distinguish between a voluntary act and a free act ; for // although every free act is necessarily a voluntary act , not every voluntary act is strictly a free act . A free act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 3:620a ) . There are occasions , however , when it makes sense to say that man has no choice and that what he wills to do he must will to do ? 28.3 . Such acts are voluntary in that they proceed from the will as a principle , but they are not free , at least in the usual and proper sense of the term . 7 . There are two types of free act , corresponding to two types of freedom : exercise and specification . ( 1 ) Freedom of exercise is that between contradictory alternatives ; it is the freedom of an agent to act or not to act in an absolute sense . In any given situation , a man who is at all rational can will to act or not . This sort of freedom man as a voluntary agent hlways has ; and as related to the interior act of willing or not willing , the voluntary act and the free act , for all practical purposes , are identical . ( 2 ) Freedom of specification presupposes freedom of exercise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by the agent . It is the choice of this alternative rather than that or , more precisely , the choice of this means in relation to a desired end . The free act as choice , therefore , is concerned with means properly , not with ends as ends . To will an end as an end is not a matter of choice but a matter of simple willing ; an act of the will centering precisely on the means is the act of choice . When reference is made to human freedom in moral contexts , it is usually this freedom of specification that is meant . 8 . In light of the foregoing , one may distinguish the component parts or specific acts that make up the complex human act , which is always concerned in some way with ends and means . The list below analyzes the human act in terms of its various steps . // Intellect Will Concerning the end 1 . Apprehending an end 2 . Willing an end 3 . Judgment about an end 4 . Intending an end Concerning the means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . Judgment about choice 8 . Choice of means Concerning execution 9 . Command to execute choice 10 . Use of powers to execute 11 . Judgment of end attained 12 . Enjoyment of end attained Not every human act man performs involves all these individual steps , nor need the steps occur in exactly this sequence , but every human act in the practical order does involve seeking some end , a judgment and a choice of means , and a consequent decision to attain to the desired end by carrying out the chosen course of action . The steps , particularly 7 and 8 , are also helpful for showing how man 's free act , or what is sometimes called his free will ? 28.2 , is actually a joint product of intellect and will . The intellect , in its practical judgment with regard to means ( 7 ) , is a determining cause of the will 's choosing one action rather than another ( 8 ) . But this is a determination coming from knowledge ; and hence the will , in exercising the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of the intellect . Even though one knows what one should do , freely choosing to do it or not is a freedom of specification inseparably connected with appetite , with the will in its act of choice . 9 . The structure of the human act , so detailed , explains how the intellect moves the will in a general way ; a more exact determination of the movement of the will pertains to a discussion of motive ( 10:39a ) . In the order of specification , of final caus ? 51 THE // ality ? 35.10 , the will can be moved by the intellect and also by the emotions and the sense faculties as these awaken a response to the apprehended good . In the order of exercise , of efficient causality ? 35.8 , however , the will holds the place of first mover in man and so is itself unmoved by any other power . As far as man is concerned , the will simply moves itself . This need not preclude , however , that the will be moved in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As already explained , the efficacy of the First Cause is such that his power extends not only to the production of all things , including the will-act , but also to the mode or manner in which such things are effected ? 48.8 . Experience , moreover , is the best proof that the will is an agent that acts freely . But as a secondary cause in the ontological sense ? 47.6 , even the will must be moved to its proper operation according to the nature . of its being as a participation of Being itself . Since its nature is to operate freely , it is moved freely by the sole cause of its nature . ? 51 . THE ENDS OF HUMAN ACTION 1 . The end ( 5:335d ) is the cause of causes , and nowhere is this axiom more applicable than in the study of human . action , for a knowledge of the ends of man 's activity confers the greatest intelligibility on the human act itself . The end may be defined as the object by virtue of which an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place . In this sense it is the same as a final cause ? 35.10 , that for the sake of which something exists or is done , that for which an agent acts or action takes place . 2 . Four elements contribute to an understanding of the concept of end in moral philosophy : its terminal nature , its causal aspect , its identity with the good , and its relation to means . ( 1 ) As terminal the end is simply the outcome or goal of what an agent does or seeks , and as such it terminates his movement toward that goal . Even when the goal aimed at is action , as when one plays simply for the action involved in // playing , the end , in this case the action itself , completes the agent 's striving . ( 2 ) As causal , the end is what is first intended and so exercises a determining influence over the actions leading up to the goal . When a patient dies in the midst of an operation , death is for him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient 's death is not the end in the sense of the cause or reason for the operation , since . it is not what the surgeon intends . The intended end , health , is responsible for each step taken by the surgeon in preparing for and carrying out the operation . If health were not intended , they would not be . Somewhat paradoxically , that which is final in the sphere of action is the cause of all the activity leading up to it ; hence , the name final cause . ( 3 ) As good , the end gives the reason why the agent tends to it or wills it ; thus end and good necessarily involve each other . Its desirability is the very reason why the good is a cause : good is said correlatively to appetite ? 26.1 ; whatever satisfies appetite and perfects it is suitable to it , and is therefore desirable . Such a concept of good is obviously wider than that of moral good . Man has different levels of appetite , and an object will be morally good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person ; it must benefit man as man , not simply as he is a sensitive or a living being see ? 62.2 . End , final cause , and good on this accounting can be seen as identical . One and the same thing is called end because it is the term of an agent 's striving , final cause because it influences the agent to act to begin with , and good because it indicates why the agent is so moved . ( 4 ) As related to means , the end specifies why something else exists or is done ; the " something else " referred to is the means . A means can not be understood without referring it to the end in view of which it is chosen . What attracts the agent to the means is not so much its nature as a particular kind of thing as it is its value for achieving the end ; put otherwise , what the agent sees and seeks in the means is basically the goodness of the end itself . 3 . While the distinction between ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so simple . Sometimes a thing may be an end in one respect and a means in another . // To deal more precisely with the complexities of the concrete situation , philosophers make various divisions of end . ( 1 ) Related ends in a given series may be distinguished on the basis of their order of achievement . A proximate end is that for the sake of which something is done directly or immediately . An intermediate end is that in view of which the proximate end is sought and which itself is desired for something else . Both proximate and intermediate ends are also means , each often being referred to as means-ends . The last end in the series is called the ultimate end . This may only be relatively ultimate , as when the series of which it is last is subordinate to a higher end or ends . The absolutely ultimate end , the supreme end , is that to which all of an agent 's actions are directed and which is sought for its own sake alone . In this sense the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51.4. ( 2 ) Another division of end is that into objective end ( finis qui ) , the good or object itself that is sought , e.g. , money or knowledge ; personal end ( finis cui ) , the person for whom the good is desired , e.g. , health is sought for Peter ; and formal end ( finis quo ) , the act in which the good is possessed or enjoyed , e.g. , the enjoyment of food is in the eating . ( 3 ) The end of the work ( finis operis ) , sometimes called the end of the act , is the normal purpose or function of a thing or action , or the result normally achieved ; e.g. , cutting is the normal function of a knife . The end of the agent ( finis operantis ) is what the agent actually intends when acting , be it identical or not with the end of the work ; so a person may use a knife for cutting or as a screwdriver . 4 . The problem of man 's ultimate end is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an overall good of human action , an ultimate end , that is only an end and must be loved and sought by itself alone . Philosophers are in verbal agreement concerning the comprehensive good sought by man : all men seek happiness ( 6:918b ) . This is intended to be a purely factual or descriptive statement , viz , to be a human agent is to direct oneself toward some end as perfective and as constitutive of happiness . Unanimity is far from complete , however , concerning where human happiness is to be found ? 86.6 . The classic // statement is Aristotle 's , who held that , from the vantage point of philosophy , there is only one ultimate end that truly perfects the human agent . His argument may be summarized as follows . Only a good commensurate . with the agent can be perfective of the agent . For this reason the human good , human happiness , can not consist in the activity of the vegetative powers or in that of the sensitive powers as such . The specifically human function is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellence of that activity . Consequently , Aristotle observes , the human good must consist in excellent , or virtuous rational activity . And since " rational activity " is ambiguous , covering both the activity of reason itself and the acts of other faculties insofar Us they can be brought under the sway of reason , the excellences , or virtues , that constitute the good perfective of the human agent are both intellectual and moral . In the context of the moral virtues , therefore , man is not free to choose whether or not his happiness or perfection consists in prudence , justice , temperance , and fortitude . These are so many articulations of the end that , in the natural dispensation , is given man as alone perfective of him as a human agent . But the highest excellence of reason is wisdom ? 36.1 , and so the truest human happiness lies in the contemplation of the truths that can be known about the highest realities . Such a life is godlike , since it belongs to man only because he has intelligence like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complement Aristotle 's teaching by emphasizing that God is the true final cause and ultimate end of all of man 's activity ? 47.1 , that God alone is the supreme good ( 6:620c ) , and that man 's happiness must therefore consist in the contemplation of God himself , given in the beatific vision ( 2:186a ) and attained only in an afterlife . ? 52 . VOLUNTARITY AND INVOLUNTARITY 1 . Voluntarity ( 14:747c ) is the character of a human act that is free , i.e. , performed willingly with adequate knowledge // of the circumstances and without necessitation from external forces . This characterization arises in the context of man having an ultimate end , and requiring deliberation and choice so as to select the means whereby to achieve , or realize , this end in particular acts . Once more , man is not free to choose just any end as perfective of the kind of agent he is , any more than he can constitute his own nature otherwise than as it is ? 17.4 . But , unlike other cosmic agents , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He must choose , in the various and fluctuating circumstances in which he finds himself , the way in which he can achieve his good , or perfection . In order so to choose , he must be aware of his circumstances so that , given these , he can deliberate about and assess the best way to act here and now . The voluntary act is one that proceeds from such deliberation and involves a choice that is not necessitated by any external force . 2 . The voluntary act is deliberate , flowing knowingly from a principle intrinsic to the agent . The " knowingly " is important , for actions done out of ignorance usually do not satisfy this definition , and thus arc called non-voluntary . The " principle intrinsic to the agent " is the will , in the case of elicited acts , or a power that comes under the sway of the will , in the case of imperated acts ? 50.1 . Thus , just as acts can be rational either essentially or by way of participation , so too acts can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , it should be noted that sometimes inaction or not willing is said to be voluntary . A mark of the voluntary agent is that he has it within his power both to act and not to act ; and although it is positive action that first comes to mind when one speaks of the voluntary , the refusal to act , the refusal to will , can be praiseworthy or culpable ? itself a sign that not acting too is sometimes voluntary . 3 . The nature of the voluntary act can better be seen by examining cases in which the voluntarity of an act is seemingly or really , wholly or partially , impeded , and thereby gives rise to what is known as involuntarily ( 7:604d ) . ( ( 1 ) An act done // whose source is outside the agent and to which the agent contributes nothing ? 17.6 . One who is seized and borne away against his wishes , who is compelled to go where his captors take him , does not go voluntarily and is not held responsible for such activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , are those that are normally imperated or commanded by the will ; elicited acts are voluntary by their nature and can never be forced ? 50.1. ( 2 ) Actions done out of fear ( 5:864a ) combine elements of voluntarity and involuntarity . For something to be done because of fear , there must be at least some consent on the part of the will , since the agent is led to what he does , not because of the fear itself , but in order to avoid the evil that is feared . Yet what is done out of fear is also involuntary , in the sense that it is contrary to what would be the will 's inclination apart from the circumstances that evoke the fear . To put the matter generally , actions done because of fear remain voluntary and responsible absolutely speaking ( simpliciter ) , although they become involuntary in a certain respect ( secundum quid ) , and thus lessen responsibility ? 53.7 to that extent . ( ( 3 ) Actions performed under the influence of emotion ( 5:317a ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , and so are evaluated differently depending on whether the emotion is antecedent or consequent . ( a ) Emotion is said to be antecedent if it arises independently of any stimulation or encouragement on the part of the will . It is thus not a voluntary excitement of the sense appetite , but one that is set off spontaneously on a subvolitional level . It is called antecedent because it arises prior to any act of the will causing or approving it . Since emotion of this kind is not subject to voluntary control , it can not be accounted voluntary . The person thus impassioned is not responsible for the emotion until it is possible for the will to assume control of it . At the moment when the will deliberately consents to the emotion , or neglects to subdue it when it can and should , it becomes voluntary and hence ceases to be antecedent emotion . ( b ) Consequent emotion is voluntary , whether indirectly , as when the will neglects to subdue it , or directly , as happens // under compulsion or force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion itself is the object of direct desire either for its own sake or as a means to something else . 4 . Not every ignorance ( 7:356d ) deprives an act of its voluntarity ? 52.2 . In its moral aspect ignorance is generally considered as being of three types . ( 1 ) Invincible or antecedent ignorance precedes the action and effectively makes it nonvoluntary . It is said to be invincible when it can not be dispelled by the reasonable diligence a prudent man would be expected to exercise in a given situation . ( 2 ) Vincible or consequent ignorance is that which could be dispelled by the application of reasonable diligence . To the degree that the agent culpably neglects to make the effort necessary to become better informed his ignorance is effectively willed , and to that degree , the resulting action is voluntary . ( ( 3 ) Concomitant ignorance is that of an agent who does something he is not aware of doing , and who yet would be quite willing to do the same thing even if he were not ignorant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he happens to dislike and would be only too happy to insult if the occasion presented itself . His act is not involuntary in the sense that it is opposed to his will ; neither is it voluntary in this particular case because he does not know what he is doing . I Ie acts , therefore , with ignorance but not out of ignorance , and the action is best described as nonvoluntary . The external act is not imputable ? 53.7 to the agent , but he is not free of fault because of his habitual malicious disposition toward his neighbor. ? 53 . MORALITY AND RESPONSIBILITY 1 . Morality ( 9:1129b ) is the quality attributable to human action by reason of its conformity or lack of conformity to the standard or rule according to which it should be regulated . This supposes , on the one hand , that human actions are voluntary and responsible and , on the other , that there is a standard or rule by which human conduct can be measured . From what has // already been said , such a standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which consists in action that is most in /accord with his nature , viz , virtuous living as specified by right reason . Another norm is more extrinsic to man , namely , law ; how these two norms or standards are related will be explained presently ? 54 . For the moment it will suffice to say generally that man 's end sets the norm against which the morality of his actions is to be judged , and in terms of which the species of motality can be determined ? 51.4-5. 2 . The relation of any act to man 's end may be threefold : ( 1 ) if the choice promotes the attainment of the end , the act is morally good ; ( 2 ) if the choice defeats the end , the act is morally bad or evil ? 48 ; and ( 3 ) if the choice does neither , the act is morally indifferent . The third category presents a special problem , whose discussion will be postponed on that account ? 53.6 . The more fundamental distinction is between actions that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of morality is that of determining what makes the one good and the other bad . 3 . The morality of a human act is specified by three determinants of the action : the object , the end , and the circumstances . ( ( 1 ) The object is that which is actually done or projected as a possible human accomplishment . It is also that about which the choice is concerned , or alternatively , the finis operis to which the action tends by its very nature . For example , the object of murder is the taking of the life of an innocent person . It is the object , so understood , that primarily specifies an action as morally good or bad . ( 2 ) The end is the purpose or motive for which the agent acts . An act , otherwise good , might be vitiated by being performed for an evil purpose . On the other hand , an act that is evil by its object , such as murder , can not be made good because the murderer has a good intention ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , ( 5:337c ) . ( 3 ) The circumstances ( 3:880d ) are individuating conditions that , although in themselves not part of the nature of the action , nevertheless modify in some real way its moral quality . Some circumstances affect the very doing of the action , i.e. , when , where , // and how ; others relate to the causes that bring about the action , i.e. , who , by what means , with whose help ; and yet another , how much , concerns the effect with regard to its quantitative aspect . Some moralists list the motive or purpose of the act , its why , among the circumstances , but this is usually counted as a special determinant , the end already mentioned ( 2 ) . 4 . Just as a being is good only when it has all the perfections or goods belonging to its nature , so an action is good only when all the determinants of its morality are good . A morally good object must be chosen , the motive that prompts the action must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus the general rule is that a human action warrants the qualification of goodness only when all the determinants are in accord with the norm of right reason and therefore good ; when any single element among these determinants departs from the norm and is lacking in goodness , the action is characterized as morally bad , even though bad in a qualified sense . Hence the Latin axiom : bonum ex integra causa , mOlum ex quocumque defectu. 5 . The consequences of an action normally do not affect its morality , except insofar as they are known and willed and thus become part of the nature of the act itself . Yet had consequences , which , though unintended , are foreseen as following from what is directly intended , may be reason for forbidding an act innocent in itself . Difficult cases are generally adjudicated in terms of the principle of the double effect ( 4:1020d ) . The principle enumerates four conditions that must be verified for one to perform an action from which at least two effects or consequences will follow , one good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by its object must be morally good or at least indifferent . ( 2 ) The agent must not positively will the bad effect but must merely permit it ; if he could attain the good effect without the bad , he should do so . The bad effect is sometimes said to be only indirectly voluntary . ( 3 ) The good effect must be produced directly by the action , not by the bad effect ; otherwise the agent would be using a bad means to a good end , which is not allowed . ( 4 ) There must be a proper proportion // between the good achieved and the evil tolerated because of it . 6 . The problem as to whether or not a human act can be morally indifferent ? 53.2 is generally solved as follows ( 7 : 468b ) . The object of an act is the primary determinant of its morality , but since it concerns the general nature of the act it is expressed in an abstract way , such as exercising , working , speaking . Yet a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather in the concrete conditions of its existence . Viewed in the first way an act can be indifferent , for some acts according to their nature neither imply something pertaining to the order of reason nor something contrary to this order . Seen in the second way , however , every human act is morally good or bad , for in the concrete it is always performed for some end and is surrounded by a host of circumstances . These , being good or evil , will remove the indifference of the act as abstractly conceived and make it either good or bad for the person who performs it for this purpose , at that time , and so on . 7 . Responsibility ( 12 : 392d ) designates a person 's moral accountability for his actions ; the same general idea is expressed by the related term , imputability ( 7:407d ) . More precisely , imputability is a quality of actions , facts , or consequences by which they are attributable to an agent , and responsibility is a quality of the , agent to which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . ( 1 ) Employed descriptively , it simply expresses a cause-effect relationship between an agent and an action or a consequence , without implying anything with regard to the ethical character of the act . ( 2 ) Used prescriptively , it indicates a moral obligation ( ( 10:614c ) binding one to do or to avoid doing something , as in the statement , " It is a man 's responsibility to care for his children . " This is responsibility in an objective sense . ( ( 3 ) Used ascriptively , the term attributes blame or credit to an agent who acts with or without due conformity to moral norms of conduct . This is responsibility in a subjective sense . The last is the more common meaning among moralists , for they are concerned not only with the objective moral character of what is done , but also with whether or not the objectively good or bad act can be imputed // to an agent in the particular state of consciousness or of feeling with which he acts . ( For a full discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . 8 . In connection with responsibility a special problem arises when two or more agents cooperate in the production of an evil action and the degree of their responsibility must be ascertained . This is known generally as the problem of cooperation ( 13 : 245d ) , meaning by this the action of aiding another in carrying out an evil act . It is common to distinguish between cooperation that is formal and that which is material . ( 1 ) Formal cooperation occurs when the cooperator shares in some way in the intention and purpose of the one whom he assists ; this is always evil because it involves , virtually at least , a sharing in an evil purpose . ( 2 ) Material cooperation avoids participation in the evil intention ; the cooperator in this case . does not want the evil action to take place , and there is an ambiguity about what he actually does . His assistance may in fact contribute to the evil act , but it is not of its nature or in the circumstances exclusively ordained to the commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain conditions , viz , that the action of the material cooperator is not evil in itself , that his intention is good , and that he has a proportionately grave reason for doing something that may contribute in some way to the evil action of another . ? 54 . LAW AND RIGHT REASON 1 . Among the internal principles of human acts , virtue is the primary means of directing man to the good of human happiness ; among the external principles , law enjoys a similar status in enabling him to lead the good life . As is evident from experience , the common good ? 76.4 is the end or purpose of all law , and without an understanding of what the common good properly is , the nature and function of law in directing human acts can not be appreciated . A common good is clearly distinct from a private good , the latter being the good of one person only , to the // exclusion of its being possessed by any other . A common good is distinct also from a collective good , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really participated in by the members of the group ; as divided up , a collective good becomes respectively private goods of the members . A true common good is universal , not singular or collective , and is distributive in character , being communicable to many without becoming anyone 's private good . Moreover , each person participates in the whole common good , not merely in a part of it , nor can any one person possess it wholly . The distinctive common good to which human law is ordered is the civil , or political , good of peace and order . Such direction of human acts by law is clearly indispensable for human development and perfection . 2 . The classic definition of law ( 8:545a ) is based on the foregoing notion of the common good : law is a certain ordination of reason for the common good , promulgated by one who has care of the community . This common definition of law applies proportionately or analogously to the different kinds of law . According to man 's mode of knowing , civil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law . Hence law is first understood to be an ordinance of reason by one who has authority to direct the political society and its members to the common civil good , a happiness consisting primarily in peace and order . Civil law directly concerns the external acts of human beings , presupposing the interior principles and acts ? 84 . Although civil law therefore does not directly aim to make men virtuous in their actions , it does command certain acts that dispose men to become virtuous and forbid other acts that lead to vice and tend to make life in society impossible . 3 . Every civil law , insofar as it aims at the common good and is accordingly a just law , carries an obligation to be obeyed . Yet this obligation rests on more than civil law itself . It derives from a law more fundamental than civil law and its political sanction , viz , what is called natural law ( 10:251c ) . This is the " unwritten law " that , in its most common precepts , is fundamentally the same for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily , the fundamental inclinations of human // reason formulated by reason in a judgment naturally made , that is , with little or no discursive reasoning . Such law , then , is natural on two scores : ( 1 ) it is not law made by reason so much as discovered by reason ; and ( 2 ) all men thus naturally know the most universal precepts expressed in natural law . Natural law , so understood , is clearly a fundamental principle for directing human acts . 4 . One other kind of law must still be mentioned : eternal law . It is even more fundamental than natural law , being the law in which even natural law participates . Eternal law refers to the idea of the government of things that exists in the mind of God ? 46.7 ; it is the plan of God 's wisdom by which all action and motion of the universe is directed . It directs the universe as a whole to the common good of God himself . This is not the law given through revelation . The knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though usually indirectly . Eternal law is therefore the ultimate source of all law and the ultimate directive principle of all acts and motions of creatures to their proper ends . 5 . The hlabit or innate ability in man to recognize the first principles of the moral order and so of natural law without recourse to discursive reasoning is known as synderesis ( 13 : 881d ) . This is a natural habit basically the same as that of understanding ? 36.2 . The principles at which it arrives are not themselves natural or innate , for like all intellectual knowledge they have their origin in sense experience ; yet each man does have the innate or natural capacity to grasp their truth once he understands the concepts presupposed to their judgment . One man may have greater insight into their meaning than another , however , if he has greater capacity of intellect ; this in turn will depend upon the state of refinement of his internal and external sense powers . 6 . Synderesis is the internal source from which springs man 's knowledge of the natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action is that of the good , the first principle of the practical order must be : Good is to be done ? together with its necessary complement : Evil is to be avoided . This therefore // is the basic principle for natural moral law . Following immediately from it , and thus known also by synderesis , are the simple or primary precepts of the natural law : A being must act according to its nature , a reasonable being must act reasonably , etc . The natural law prescribes those acts that are morally good for man , i.e. , in accord with his natural inclinations : namely , ( 1 ) in common with all beings and living things , to maintain his being and his life ; ( 2 ) in common with animals , to ensure continuation of his race by reproducing and caring properly for offspring ; then , ( 3 ) properly as human , to pursue truth , exercise freedom , and cultivate virtue . These are the basic natural inclinations of all men , at all times , everywhere . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with intellectual development . 7 . Synderesis assures possession of the most general and universal knowledge of the principles of the practical order ; to discover reasonable rules of acting in more specific detail another habit of mind is needed , and this is known as prudence ( 11 : 925d ) or practical wisdom . Unlike synderesis prudence is an acquired virtue whereby man discerns the correct means to achieve the goals set by synderesis in his individual actions ; for this reason it is known as right reason concerning what is to be done ( recta ratio agibilium ) . Although , like synderesis , a habit of the intellect , prudence is counted as a moral virtue because it forms the link connecting the activities of the other cardinal virtues , discerning for them the proper means whereby they can achieve their natural , and therefore good , inclinations . Its key role in enabling man to achieve his goal of virtuous living in accordance with right reason is explained in what follows ? 55. 5-6. 8 . Unlike synderesis and prudence , which are habits , conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the knowledge that accompanies an action and notifies the agent of its rightness or wrongness . Because of this accompanying role conscience is referred to as the subjective norm of morality , since it provides a personal evaluation of the goodness or badness of each individual action . Unfortunately conscience in itself is fallible and so not
