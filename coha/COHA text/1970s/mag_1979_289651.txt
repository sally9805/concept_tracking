THE EUROPEANS Directed by James Ivory Screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala The Europeans is one of Henry James ' most delightful novels , a small , approachable comedy of manners , widely regarded among Jamesian scholars as the masterpiece of his early years . But the story of Eugenia and Felix , Europeanized sister and brother who return to Massachusetts for some genteel fortune hunting , is , on the face of it , unlikely material for a film in the Age of Travolta . <P> More power , therefore , to Director Ivory and his collaborator , Jhabvala , for making the effort , and for providing a reasonably faithful and literate screen version of the tale . It is good to hear subtle and intelligent conversation in our native accents issuing from a movie screen-and to see New England caught in its glorious fall foliage . <P> The piece has a good , basic comic premise in the puzzled response of the black-clad , soberly Unitarian locals to the exotic birds of passage who have come to light among them . This is nicely realized in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing in his cousin Gertrude a fellow spirit struggling to burst free . The couple , played with lively grace by Tim Woodward and Lisa Eichhorn , provide the movie with its most beguiling passages , and their story , his winning her away from the lumpish minister her family intends her to marry , gives it its strong est narrative pulse as well . <P> About Eugenia 's pursuit of the well-to-do Robert Acton - what should be the film 's central action - one 's feelings are ambiguous . James himself never quite pinned down what instinct preserved Acton and his fortune from her designs . The movie is even less clear on that point , perhaps because Lee Remick , as Eugenia , does not touch on those hints of boldness and desperation that are implicit in the text . Robin Ellis might have brought to Acton more of the shrewdness and tart ness of his Poldark . As presented , the pair are so agreeable and handsome that one sees no reason for them not to get together in the end . <P> Ivory might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director , unable to dig out tensions lurking beneath his correct , bland surfaces . The result is a pleasant , pretty entertainment . One suspects that this film is outside its natural element on a theatrical screen , that its mod est virtues would shine to better advantage on PBS . If we had a properly functioning public broadcasting system in the country , American classics like The Europeans might be produced with funds and talent in profusion .
