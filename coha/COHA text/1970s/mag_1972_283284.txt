PLAY IT AS IT LAYS <P> Directed by FRANK PERRY Screenplay by JOAN DIDION and JOHN GREGORY DUNNE <P> Better stop , look around <P> Here it comes , here it comes <P> Here comes your 19th nervous <P> breakdown . <P> - The Rolling Stones <P> Los Angeles is a cul-de-sac at the end of the continent . With the desert before it , the ocean beyond it , there is nowhere left to go . Even the sun is seductive , sinister somehow , sapping life instead of giving it . <P> Raymond Chandler knew the territory well , Nathanael West wrote of it brilliantly in The Day of the Locust , but no one has recently taken the measure of the neon void with such savage precision as Joan Didion . Play It As It Lays was a novel about a young actress , Maria Wyeth , crumbling into the pieces of a psychic jigsaw . Didion drew the Southern California landscape with poisonous accuracy , using its shifting scenes to delineate states of an increasingly troubled mind . <P> Thus for Didion the beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture were metaphors . For Director Perry they are just locations . Shorn of image , the story is a poor and predictable thing . Moreover , dialogue like " She has these very copious menstruations " and " That lemon is not artificial . That lemon is reconstituted " reads better than it sounds . <P> Maria ( Tuesday Weld ) passes her days wandering about the grounds of a psychiatric hospital where she is a patient . " Nothing applies " she scrawls across the battery of psychological tests they give her . Her husband Carter ( Adam Roarke ) is a pompous young hack who makes motorcycle movies and discusses the auteur theory . His producer B.Z. ( Anthony Perkins ) tries both to meddle with and mend their broken marriage . Maria has already had one child-Kate , herself disturbed-and aborted a second . In her sickness and despair , she clings to Carter , who humiliates her with the kind of bitter brutality she usually heaps on herself . <P> There is not a great deal that Tuesday Weld can do with any of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially adept at expressing elfin , vaguely threatening sexuality . Maria , obsessive and tormented , eludes her . Less introverted than preoccupied , Tuesday seems as lost as Maria herself , although the only good moment in the film is hers . " See the pyramids all wet with rain / Cross the ocean in a silver plane " Maria croons , stoned crazy in an old 16-mm. verit documentary of Carter 's , and in those few seconds Weld touches some of Maria 's torment and vulnerability . Perkins has a little more success in the role of the producer , which is less complex and demanding . Both he and Weld struggle to bring some depth of feeling to the trite and turgid proceedings . <P> Perry ( David and Lisa , Diary of a Mad Housewife ) resists their every effort , and eventually defeats them . The novel had Maria crushed by the anomie symbolized-perhaps too patly - by Southern California . The movie explains nothing . Perry is like a snorkle diver bobbing about in a bowl of angst . Content to float along watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface .
