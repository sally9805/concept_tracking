THE main trend in new housing for the past 15 years has been toward bigger-and better-equipped-homes and apartments . Now the nation 's housing crisis has thrown that movement into reverse . Builders are turning again to the construction of small , stripped-down dwellings . The result is a reappearance of what social critics call suburban " ticky-tacky . " Much of it is almost as cramped , though perhaps not quite as ugly as the postwar bungalows that earned developers considerable derision in the 1950s . <P> Builders have rushed back to the low-priced end of the market because the soaring costs of labor , land , materials and especially mortgage money make it impossible for many buyers to afford larger , more expensive homes . " The three-bedroom , two-bath house that in 1966 cost $25,000 now goes for $32,000 , " says Michael Tenzer , a senior vice president of Los Angeles-based Larwin Group Inc . " Four years ago , about 41% of the people around here had incomes of $9,600 or more , which could qualify them to buy that house . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income requirement for that same house . " <P> Little More Than Livable . To hold prices down , builders offer less space and fewer amenities . Larwin 's three-bedroom models have shrunk from 1,300 sq . ft. to 1,000 , for example , and the company is putting them up on cheaper land farther from the center of the city . Larwin has dropped dishwashers as standard equipment , substituted a single oven for a double one , and switched to lower-quality kitchen cabinets . Kaufman &; Broad , which builds in 43 communities , has not only eliminated fireplaces , landscaping and air conditioning as standard items , but also shifted to a more boxy-shaped house because extra corners raise building costs . <P> The stripped-down models have a special appeal to the increasing legions of young couples eager to find a home of their own . Denver builders report brisk sales of $15,000 one-family homes . In Dayton , $16,000 three-bedroom models are market leaders . Carrying the trend to its extreme , many builders are successfully bringing out two-bedroom , one-bath houses , which buyers had shunned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Pardee Construction Co. sells a two-bedroom model for $16,000 in San Diego . " It 's livable , " says Vice President Vance Meyer , " but it 's more a shelter house than anything else . " <P> In another move to control costs , some 40 companies have begun manufacturing modular housing-factory-finished rooms that are assembled at the site . Richard Wasserman , president of Levitt &; Sons , which is building a modular factory , expects that this system will cut construction costs to at least 5% below those of today 's conventional , on-site building . Wasserman anticipates much larger savings in the years ahead because " the incredible shortage of skilled craftsmen " seems certain to drive wages at building sites up much faster than those of lower-paid factory workers .
