Into the hearing room of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week strode two men who had passed more than a quarter-century in the flickering light and shade of nonrecognition . John Stewart Service and John Paton Davies Jr. , both 65 , once middle-echelon Foreign Service officers of the State Department , as long ago as 1944 correctly diagnosed the power and potential of Mao Tse-tung 's Chinese Communist Party and urged that the U.S. make an early accommodation with it . Had this been done , they contend-and many observers agree-the U.S. might have been spared two wars-in Korea and Indochina . Drummed out of the service at that time for their views , they now see the wheel of U.S. policy come ironically full circle under Nixon . <P> Both men were born in China to U.S. missionaries shortly before the 1911 revolution toppled the Manchu dynasty . Both were educated partly in China and spoke the language fluently . By 1944 they were young old China hands stationed in Chiang Kai-shek 's wartime refugee capital , Chungking , as political officers on the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commander of U.S. forces in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II . The pair chafed at the frustrating restraints imposed on " Vinegar Joe " by the generalissimo and his Nationalist regime , which they believed was fatally weak , unpopular and corrupt . <P> Fuzzing the Issues . That was a difficult view for the U.S. to accept , for Chiang was a genuine hero , the man who had rallied his country against the Japanese invasion . Increasingly , however , his war effort bogged down , partly because of the challenge to his rule from Mao Tse-tung and the Communists . Chiang felt that he was inadequately supported by the U.S. A group of U.S. military and diplomatic observers arrived at Communist headquarters in Yenan in July 1944 . As the senior diplomat present , Service talked most with Mao and his top aides . <P> Service saw no point in fuzzing the issue by using euphemisms like " agrarian reformers " for Communists . Mao declared that his was genuine Communism . But he made a distinction that was to be lost on the West for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " nationalist " Communism and no carbon copy of Moscow 's . Mao hoped for U.S. military aid in the war against Japan . He insisted that after Japan 's defeat , the U.S. and the China that he expected to influence or control must be close friends . Mao 's Communists , Service decided , must be reckoned with . Davies later replaced Service in Yenan and reached the same conclusion : " The Communists are in China to stay . And China 's destiny is not Chiang 's but theirs . " <P> The two diplomats ' views , relayed to Washington , clashed with America 's deep pro-Chiang sympathies , and especially with the sentiments of Major General Patrick J. Hurley , U.S. ambassador to Chungking . Hurley accused the old China hands of undermining his authority , and had Service recalled . Davies was allowed to stay on longer . After V-J Day , Hurley resigned and , before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , accused Service and Davies among others of disloyalty to the U.S. , though he never went so far as to accuse them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
