Pony-tailed Teen-Ager Chris Evert became an instant favorite with the gallery when she arrived at the U.S. Open Tennis Championships in Forest Hills , N.Y. , five months ago . But many experts doubted that she was ready for the stiff world-class competition she would meet in center court . Unseeded and playing on grass for one of the few times in her brief career , " Little Miss Cool " nonetheless battled her way into the semifinals , winning one gutsy , come-from-behind victory after another . Then , alas , she met Mrs. Billie Jean King , the reigning queen of U.S. tennis . Billie Jean , the first woman athlete in history to win $100,000 in a single year , soundly spanked Chris 6-3 , 6-2 . For the moment , the Cinderella saga had come to an end . <P> For 1971 , that is . Last week , playing in the $25,000 Women 's International at Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , her first tournament since the U.S. Open , Little Miss Cool was hotter than ever . In a stunning upset , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clay courts of Fort Lauderdale since she was six , Chris Evert was always slight and something of a hitless wonder . Her backhand was so weak that her tennis-pro father , Jim Evert , taught her to hit the shot with both hands . Though she goes far toward making up in precision what she lacks in power , her pitter-patter serves and lack of a strong volley proved her ultimate undoing at Forest Hills . In the five months since , however , she not only polished her game but grew a full inch taller and five pounds heavier . ( She is now 5 ft. 5 in. and weighs 115 Ibs . ) As a result , there was more snap in her strokes , more zing in her serve and more zap in her overall attack as she advanced to the finals against Billie Jean King . <P> The big rematch drew an overflow crowd , many perching on nearby rooftops to watch the action . After the <P> Dixieland band died down and the airplanes towing banners of encouragement had passed overhead , the hometown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very first game , she took the opening set handily , 6-1 . The second set was more of the same , as Chris kept her older opponent running with a maddening array of pinpoint placements , drop shots and lobs and-when an opening came-a two-fisted backhand drive down the line . In the final game , when the tenacious Billie Jean fought back from match point five times , one excited fan yelled : " Get it over with ! " Chris , who usually plays with a poker-faced poise that one of her opponents describes as " almost eerie , " shouted back : " I 'm trying . " Then , trying harder , she scored on a solid forehand to win , 6-0 . <P> " I ca n't remember ever losing a match that badly , " said Billie Jean . Chris , just 17 , and not eligible to turn professional until next season , had to bypass the $4,400 first prize . Billie Jean , for one , can hardly wait for Chris to turn pro . " If Chris comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find out the facts of life . " One fact Chris already knows : while fighting for room at the top , she will be pressured from below by another two-fisted Evert . In the opening round of last week 's tournament , Chris ' sister Jeanne scored another big upset by defeating Rosemary Casals , the No. 3 money winner on the tour last year . Jeanne , however , will have to wait even longer to cash in on the pro purses . She is 14.
