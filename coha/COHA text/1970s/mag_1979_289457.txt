LOVE AT FIRST BITE <P> Directed by Stan Dragoti <P> Screenplay by Robert Kaufman <P> <P> Count Dracula has always been something of a romantic . Given his undead state and his all too literal bloodthirstiness , his problem has ever been to find a socially ( not to say legally ) acceptable way of expressing his sweeter side . It is the funny premise of this movie that it required the intervention of the U.S. ( circa 1970-79 ) to make the count begin to look good , despite his obvious kinks , to a lady . <P> Played by George Hamilton ( and very nicely too ) , he is booted out of Transylvania by the humorless Communists who are going to turn Castle Dracula into a sports and recreation center . The count decides to go to New York City in pursuit of Model Cindy Sondheim ( Susan Saint James ) , whom he recognizes from magazine covers as the reincarnation of the one woman he has really loved for some seven centuries . Cindy , alas , is not quite the innocent she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discos and one-night stands , popping uppers and downers as if they were Good &; Plenties and generally leading a thoroughly disorganized life . She has been having an affair with her analyst ( Richard Benjamin ) for years , but both are beset by the modern inability to make a genuine commitment . He , it turns out , is a descendant of Dr. Van Helsing , Dracula 's old nemesis from the book , play and sequels . The analyst perceives his beloved 's peril ( three bites from the count and you go over to the undead ) . But since the setting is New York now , he has some difficulty persuading anyone to care about one well-mannered vampire , whose depredations seem mild compared with all the other forms of urban chaos . In point of fact , the count 's passion for Cindy is obviously good for her , just what she has always needed to straighten out her life . <P> There is some racial joking in Love at First Bite that one could have done without . It is intended to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just plays uncomfortably . There is also a flatness about Stan Dragoti 's direction that prevents the film from realizing all its comic potential . But the performances ( including that of Arte Johnson as Renfield , the count 's bug-eating assistant ) are uniformly jolly , the parody of the basic Dracula formula well observed and its social commentary deliciously off the wall . The production 's genially tatty air enhances its anarchical mood and encourages one to go with its goofy yet often shrewd comic flow . <P> - Richard Schickel
