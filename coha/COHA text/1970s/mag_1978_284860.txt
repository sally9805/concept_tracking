A WEDDING <P> Directed by Robert Altman <P> Screenplay by John Considine , Patricia Resnick , Allan Nicholls and Robert Altman <P> It begins as a comedy of expensive manners , a satirical account of the marriage between a young man of good family and a young woman of not such good , but equally well-off family . They do n't have just a photographer to record this less-than-historic occasion , an entire documentary film crew has been engaged to shoot it . And the presiding clergyman is not merely the local minister but a bishop no less , and what matter that his miter is sweat-stained or that he is senile ? <P> Then A Wedding cracks open , revealing disorders deeper than social pretension . The matriarch of the groom 's family dies in her upstairs bedroom as the wedding party returns home for the reception , and those who know of it conspire to keep it a secret until the party is over . But the immediate cause of death may have been her discovery that no one beyond the immediate family has accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother because of a brief marriage years before to an Italian waiter . Of course that lady is a drug addict who gets her fixes from the alcoholic family doctor . <P> Not that the bride 's family is any bargain . They seem to be collateral relatives of the Snopeses . If the bride 's sister has not been made pregnant by the groom , then the deed was done by one of his 20-odd barracks mates from the military academy . Her uncle is a fundamentalist minister who got the call from God speaking through a Holiday Inn TV set . Her mother spends much of the wedding day arranging to meet an absurdly romantic uncle of the groom 's in a motel across from a Dairy Queen in Tallahassee . <P> Perverse ? No , the picture is downright subversive , a brutal comic assault on that most basic of institutions , the family . The attack is every bit as relentless , unfair and " tasteless " as Altman 's devastation of the military was in M*A*S*H . Although the family is certainly undergoing change and questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgust ( which Viet Nam provided for the earlier picture ) to support him . All he has is his own disarming skill as a moviemaker to keep audiences in an accepting mood . <P> It is very nearly enough . Many of his sharpest thrusts are contained in throwaway lines , which may be all but covered by the overlapping dialogue Altman loves to use . He demonstrates an uncanny skill at staging . His camera seems to eavesdrop almost simultaneously on a dozen conversations that reveal , in a few lines of dialogue or a fleeting expression , brilliantly encapsulated characterizations . As always , his location is full of expressive artifacts , shrewdly chosen and revealed .
