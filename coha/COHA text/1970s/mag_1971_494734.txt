Criticism of Harold Pinter has its funny side . On the one hand , there 's Pinter , disclaiming scheme or theme , replying with ( I think ) proper tartness to those who ask him to explain his plays . On the other hand , there are the critics , ex ? plaining them , panting to supply what Pinter does n't want . His dislike of criticism is not the usual one , a reaction to assault ; quite the reverse . He is adu ? lated , and he still does n't want all that decoding and classifying . Yet they per ? sist . A good example is the recently published " casebook " on The Home ? coming , in which Pinter flatly states he has nothing to say about the play . " It exists , and that 's that . " Yet the book contains essays , each of which tries to fit the play into a critic 's view of it as ethology or Freud or parodic Restora ? tion comedy or something else . The critics are quite right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artwork has an esthetic right to try to under ? stand why . And Pinter is also quite right ; he has no obligation to explain or to accept explanations . And , pos ? sibly , I 'm quite right , too ! ? to chuckle at all the above as I proceed to " inter ? pret " his new play . It 's relatively easy to " decipher " a plot and theme in Old Times , which I mean to do and then move on from it . It has only three characters . An English couple in their 40s are visited in their country home by a former girlfriend of the wife 's whom she has n't seen in 20 years . As single girls , they shared an apartment in London . It 's easy to dem ? onstrate that the two used to have a les ? bian relation in atmosphere if not in fact ; that the husband knew them at the time , although he and they now pre- . tend he did n't ; that there 's a threat that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks down and cries for pity at the end . I put all this more clearly than the play does . Pinter uses overlaid " exposures " as in photogra ? phy . Details do not quite jibe . Time is constantly past and present , as in cubist painting that shows us simultaneous views which would be impossible simul ? taneously in life . But my precis is sup ? portable . Construed from this story , the theme can be seen as the power of the female ? to create a realm in which the male is trapped , a kind of golden moist web woven by women laterally through time ; within which men can strut for a bit but are finally subordinated . In short , the world as the realm of Astarte ? Lilith-Erda , with men allowed to delude themselves about mastery . It 's not a new Pinter theme . At the end of The Homecoming , the one woman is seated with two of the play 's toughest men kneeling next to her , begging for affec ? tion . At the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then kneeled with his head on his wife 's lap , while the other woman waits prone on a bed . I do n't contend that this theme was carefully selected by Pinter . He himself has said that the play began for him with a flash of " two people talking about someone else , " and his statement fits what we know of his methods : that he 's largely an intuitive " automatic " writer , whose real work of design begins only as the words begin on paper . What lies behind this process is the esthetic history of this century . Since art began , every artist has known that he had in him something unsayable which he was trying to express within the conventions of his art and that he was , to some degree , failing to express it fully because of those conventions , which still were his means of expressing what he did manage to express . The bet ? ter the artist was the more keenly he felt the failure . Shakespeare , I 'm sure , felt that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have begun to try various means to cir ? cumvent that failure , to circumvent the conventions of their art and to say the unsayable without the mediation of tra ? ditional forms . This is essentially the impulse behind , say , ' Cage 's music , Ar ? taud 's theater and various kinds of ab ? stract and action painting . Pinter 's play-writing can be seen as classic surreal ? ism , dealing with well-defined objects ar ? ranged in such a way that the point is not in their detail ? the fine details are in a way a deliberate deception ? but in the trajectory outlined by the way they are deployed , in the space they enclose , in the surprise and shock and laughter that the succession of these details arouses in us . In this view the audience writes the play ( as the audience writes Cage 's music ) within boundaries described by the author and in response to data and stimuli that he supplies . The pauses and silences specified in Pinter 's scripts are not only musical similes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play rests for a moment while you draw abreast of it in simultaneous creation . Of course this process of audience col ? laboration is not exclusive to surrealists . It 's part of all esthetic experience , but it 's a much greater part when the work 's primary purpose is not mimesis or re ? presentation but to open a direct con ? duit between the deepest region of the author 's psyche and ours . How , then , do value judgments per tain ? Once an author establishes that he ( continued on page 29 ) DECEMBER 18 , 1971 with Ed Brady , Ben Reitman and Hip ? polyte Havel . As a woman of ? fifty ? three , she found it impossible to keep her hands off a " flaxen-haired , blue-eyed Swedish boy , " despite the fact that Berkman was deeply upset by the rela ? tionship . And finally there was James Colton , who became her second hus ? band . Does this series of affairs justify the use of the word " promiscuity " ? I believe it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am concerned , des ? criptive , not judgmental . Jane Goldman also believes I over ? emphasize Emma 's emotional violence . Yet there are many other examples be ? sides the attack on the sneering woman in Rochester and the horsewhipping of Most . Thus when she threw Ben Reit ? man out of her love life she did so by picking up a chair " in a blind fury " and hurling it at him . But as with my listing of her lovers , I cite these instances of her violence not in order to discredit Emma Goldman in any way , but in or ? der to cast light on her extraordinary career . In sum , I believe that Jane Goldman has written a silly , needlessly protective letter . I am however , grateful to her for correcting me about that extra half-sister . Kenneth S. Lynn Lincoln Steffens Sirs : In his reconsideration of The Auto ? biography of Lincoln Steffens , Andrew Greeley writes that Steffens saw his life as the fulfillment of the Horatio Alger myth . But Steffens did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of probity , earnestness and good works . He did not believe the failure to " make it " in American society was some sort of moral stigma and his own biography was not a Horatio Alger story . He went from an upper-middle-class background in Sacramento to a successful position in journalism . Steffens was talented but there is also the clear indication in the book that he was lucky , especially lucky to be left a sizable inheritance by a friend in Germany . The point is the muckraker told his readers what he learned from his contacts with the fam ? ous and powerful . The Autobiography reveals a process of education in which a fairly conventional American came to shed his liberal illusions . It is true that Steffens did not pay adequate attention to the immigration phenomenon and it should be added that although he was a founding spon ? sor of the NAACP he was generally unconcerned with racism . Greeley dis ? misses Steffens involvement with the Jewish East Side as romanticism but the fact is that as reporter and editor Stef ? fens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Side intel ? lectuals and he communicated those experiences to his readers . He rejected the argument that the source of urban corruption was the presence of immi ? grants and called attention to the Amer ? ican cities with predominantly native-born populations that were profoundly corrupt . Greeley offers us an operational ap ? proach to the problem of corruption . He would have us build the political coa ? litions , operating within the system , that can improve the quality of urban life . . . . But even after all the years since the appearance of Steffens ' Auto ? biography we can still profit by remind ? ing ourselves of his main point , that we need to uncover the roots of corrup ? tion and that these roots are not found in personal immorality but in the insti ? tutional arrangements of American society . Herbert Shapiro University of Cincinnati Kauffmann , from page 20 is able to make these connections with us , are all his works equally good ? How do I know that I like The Caretaker more than The Birthday Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than The Home ? coming ? Principally by the gravity of the material encompassed in our psyches , by the breadth of the encom ? passment . Old Times touches mysteries , but the compass seems narrower than in The Homecoming . The previous play seemed to entail more abOut more men and ' women , a larger aspect of the male-female cosmos , than the new work . Old Times , enticing as it is , enjoyable as it is , is less resonant . Pinter is often compared with Beckett , his presumptive master , so a further hierarchical statement may be useful . Pinter deals with aspects of mortality . 29 Beckett , quintessentially , deals with mortality in the purview of immortality . E. M. Cioran has pointed out that Bec ? kett is not a nihilist btit a mystic , to whom physical existence is an interrup ? tion of a greater and perfect existence . Nothing like this view is to be found ? yet ? in Pinter , whose " unsayable " still resides in London . But , like Beckett , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsequitur ( a surrealist hallmark ) , which is of ? ten launched with furious , hilarious elo ? quence . I laughed quite a lot at the New York production of Old Times , more than I did at the London production I saw last summer , principally because Robert Shaw is a much richer actor than the man who played the part in London . ( Mary Ure , the wife , and Rosemary , Harris , the friend , are also excellent in the New York production , under Peter Hall 's chamber-music direc ? tion . ) The husband has most of the funny stuff because he is the one who is thrashing about desperately , he is the butt . Shaw appreciates this in theatrical and human terms . All this talk of instinctive writing , of surrealism , does n't deny the theme I cited earlier . It means only that the theme became clear to Pinter , out of his own depths , as he wrote rather than be ? fore he wrote . Nor does it imply that Pinter merely slaps things down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanguy merely slapped paint on can ? vas . After the impulse , the exquisite modeling . Take the very first sight , the very first line , of Old Times . When the curtain rises , the husband and wife are seated in light , the other woman is standing in shadow at back , looking away . She is waiting to " enter . " The visible and pre ? dictable sequence is immediately taking ; before the play is a minute old , we know that relativity of time is part of the drama . The first line is just one word . The wife says : " Dark . " Then , as per the printed script , comes the stage direc ? tion : Pause . ( ! ) One word , " Dark , " then a pause . The ? other woman is in the dark . Is that what 's meant ? What kind of dark ? A half dozen questions flash through our minds . The pause is to allow them - and to allow the picture to sink in . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the wife replies , " Fuller than me . I think , " and we realize that they 're talking about the other woman and that " dark " means dark-haired The process is much like an open chord in music being clarified by the addition of tones . How well it all works . No wonder ac ? tors love Pinter . Writing about The Caretaker almost eight years ago ( NR , Jan. 25 , 1964 ) , I admired Pinter but hoped he would be a different writer at 40 and 50 and 70 . He 's now 41 and has moved from the " menace " plays to The Homecoming and the lyrical short plays Landscape and Silence and this new sex-and-time teaser . His power to grow is one of the most cheering . aspects of contemporary writing . He is a chief reason why the theater of the word - the new theater of the word that understands the unsaid - is alive . The Prisoner of Second Avenue is Neil Simon 's new laugh hit ( it does have laughs ) about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Simon is a sketch writer who ca n't sustain a full-length play . The first half builds ; the second half disintegrates into skits and gags and padding . The most interesting point about it is social . The play takes as given that the US is in the middle of an economic de ? pression . You can figure backwards how serious that depression really is if a writer like Simon , who depends en ? tirely on quick recognitions , has de ? pended on the quick recognition of that fact .
