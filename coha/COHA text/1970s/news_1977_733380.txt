txt The National Women 's Conference in Houston has left its imprint largely on the minds of those who were there . It will be their task to make the experience meaningful to the nation . The 2,000 women who attended the meeting as official delegates of their states voted overwhelmingly for 25 proposals to promote the equality of women . That was no surprise . The Government need not have spent $5 million to learn that women at such a conference would endorse the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution , vote for Government help with the problems of child care , child abuse , wife beating , equal credit opportunity , access to good jobs , and the like . Beyond that , we found one value in the meeting , and one risk . The value lay in the election of convention delegates through open state meetings , bringing hundreds of new faces into the political arena . There were more old and young women , more blacks , more Hispanics in Texas last weekend than is usual at events promoting women 's rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the resolutions . The familiar star writers and politicians of the women 's movement remained largely in the background to let the new voices be heard . But such stabs at democratization fell considerably short of producing an assembly representative of the women of America . Politicians in Washington and state capitals will still look to their mail boxes , and not to Houston , for guidance on how to vote on the issues the women put forward . The conference , therefore , also represented a risk to its organizers and to the cause of women 's rights . There was little to gain from the four-day pep rally except perhaps a stirring of tired blood for battles ahead . There was , however , something to lose . For Houston gave forth a contrary assessment of the needs of women at a counter-rally staged by Phyllis Schlafly , the leader of the opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment . Mrs. Schlafly condemned the amendment as well as publicly-paid abortions and rights for homosexuals as anti-family and antiAmerican . She , too , claimed to speak for a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to the movement that spawned it . The Schlafly attack is worrisome , however , because it sees a denial of women 's rights as the essential prop of the family . The women 's rights movement did not cause the undeniable erosion of family life . Rather , it is more nearly the result of that erosion . Mrs. Schlafly may dream of a Norman Rockwell world that no longer exists in most places but she has aroused inordinate fear among some women about evolving life styles . To her supporters , E.R.A. is an outrageous attempt to integrate restrooms and to force women into the front lines of the next war . To them , governmentprovided day care for the poor is a rude intervention of the ' state into the intimate relationship between mother and child . They are wrong . But the women who are frightened by such rhetoric need to be reassured . The Houston gathering was only one phase of a long educational process .                    @
