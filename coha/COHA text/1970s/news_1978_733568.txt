txt Over the years , hard times and relative prosperity have alternated in this little town 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh . And the good times have proved to be a mixed blessing . Generations of residents have lived by digging coal , leaving the rolling countryside scarred with abandoned mines . Construction of an interstate highway some years ago brought new industry and tourists , along with a jumble of motels and service stations . The 3,000 people of New Stanton and the residents of surrounding communities now are bracing for their next wave of prosperity . Next Monday , Volkswagenwerk AG , the big West German automobile maker , is opening its first U.S. car-assembly plant on one-time farmland about three miles from here . State and local officialdom is rolling out the welcome mat . But VW 's arrival is causing misgivings among many local citizens . On the one hand , the plant will generate thousands of new jobs and pump scores of millions of dollars annually into the economy of an area plagued by high unemployment . At the same time , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and businesses and striking a terminal blow at what remains of the relatively tranquil . semirural life here . What Kind of Coexistence ? " I know this is progress , and I hope we can peacefully coexist with it , " says Jack Wilkinson , an avid sportsman and owner of 1,000 acres of local farmland , " but what I see coming are traffic , sewage , pollution and racial problems . If I wanted to live in Detroit , I would have moved there . " It 's too early to tell if the worst fears of Mr. Wilkinson and others will be realized . Some problems already have surfaced , and even enthusiastic backers of the VW project concede that more are likely . But they all can be handled , contends William Potoka , mayor of nearby Mount Pleasant Borough , one of the towns to be most affected . " There are many more pluses than minuses in Volkswagen 's coming , " tie says . VW clearly is eager to win over local residents , but its stakes in the project go far beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly facility is the key element in an ambitious gamble whose cost totals some 5300 million . The big German firm is trying to regain its once-lofty position in the U.S. auto market . In its heyday , VW sold well over 500,000 cars'a year here and accounted for about 5'r of the total U.S. car market . Last year . VW sales were just over 250.000 cars , less than 37 , of industry deliveries The Too-Healthy Mark Iconically , much of VW 's U.S. sales woes stem from the success of the German economy . a boom fueled in part by VW . The value of the German mark has risen steadily against the dollar , making it more expensive to bring German-made products into this country . This , coupled with rising production costs in Germany , has pushed up the price of VW cars over the last few years and made them less competitive with many Japanese and U.S.-built cars VW hopes to insulate itself against such currency fluctuations by building cars here . This reasoning looks ever better as the dollar 's value continues to erode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers , particularly the Japanese , to steeply increase the price of their cars in the U.S. market . So , while VW is the first foreign auto maker venturing to these shores in decades several foreign firms manufactured cars here early in this century ) , many believe it wo n't be the last . If auto importers " expect to remain competitive in the U.S. market , they 're going to have to make a move , " argues James , a former General Motors Corp . executive who now heads the subsidiary VW set up to build cars here . The plant will assemble subcompact Rabbits , VW 's most popular model . It is slated to turn out about 60,000 cars this year and 200,000 next year . In 1979 , the only imported Rabbits will be those with diesel engines . VW 's other car models , such as the Dasher and Scirocco , still will come from overseas , at least for the near future . Low-Price Lure VW does n't plan any immediate price cuts on its Americanized Rabbits , but the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , thus attracting more buyers . Mr. and other VW officials boldly predict that within two or three years VW will regain a 5% slice of U.S. auto sales . If the potential payoffs are great , so are the risks . A good part of importers ' success here rests on their reputation for building higher-quality cars than their American competitors . With Rabbits rolling out of Pennsylvania instead of Germany , some observers believe , and some hope , that VW 's mystique will be tarnished . " This ought to prove once and for all that elves In the Black Forest do n't make cars any better than we do here , " quips GM chairman Thomas Murphy . Though VW appears to be working hard to ensure the quality of its American-made cars , It remains to be seen how well the company has accomplished the vastly complex job of starting an auto-assembly operation in just 18 months . For instance , creating a network to supply the myriad parts for the cars is a huge task . While VW already has signed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts ) . Allied Chemical Corp . ( for seat belts ) and Motorola Inc. ( for radios ) , time and money constraints have forced the auto maker to rely initially on its own overseas plants for most parts , including engines and transmissions . Only about 25% of the parts in the first U.S. Rabbits will come from U.S. manufacturers , though by 1980 VW hopes to raise that to 75% . The state of Pennsylvania has labored to ease the way for its new resident . When VW announced its intention to build cars in the U.S .. state officials , led by Gov . Milton Shapp. lobbied funously to win the project from competing states . They put together a multimillion-dollar package that included purchase of the assembly plant , which had been built in the late 1960s by Chrysler Corp . but never used . The state then leased it back to VW. installed new highway and rail connections to the facility and lined up property tax breaks and job training programs . The state also took on the gargantuan task of helping VW sift through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4,500 jobs at the plant . So far , about 1,000 jobs have been filled . The selection process already has brought complaints and occasional picketing at the plant by civilrights groups that fear too few minorities will be hired . Despite such headaches , state officials say they do n't regret wooing and winning VW . This is going to be a big stimulus to our businesses and our economy , " says Martin Margolis , a special assistant to Gov . Shapp . An Angry Businessman That , while true , is no solace to Stanley Yanuck , owner of Diamond Auto Parts in Mount Pleasant . The new railroad line to VW runs right through the middle of town ? and right next to his store . The rail line cut off 150 feet of parking on the side of the store and blocked his rdam loading dock . And , Mr Yanuck complains . when trains go by , the building sometimes vibrates so much " it feels like you 're riding in a car with square wheels . " The state and Mr. Yanuck are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by the rail line . " They have hurt the future of my business , " Mr Yanuck charges . Another tangible sign of VW 's presence is the new section of freeway to the plant . That road required the demolition of some homes . And it set Mr. Wilkinson . the sportsman and farmer , to fretting about deer . The new highway crosses some deer paths in an area where more than 1,000 deer were killed last year by motorists . Mr. Wilkinson persistently tried , but failed , to get the state to erect special fences , even taking aerial photographs of the deer paths to bolster his argument . If some people have their way , the deer and the area 's residents soon will be confronted by a thicket of new apartments , carwash facilities , bowling alleys and the like . Speculators and developers have descended on the area hoping to stake a claim in the expected prosperity . New Stanton Mayor John Reagan says " hundreds " of such people have visited his office inquiring about land and building permits . Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a wall of the city hall he proudly displays a photo from a German magazine showing him happily sitting on the hood of a Rabbit while holding two live rabbits in his lap . Some question whether all the speculative fever will turn out to be much more than just that . Property values have risen  --  by as much as 100% in some cases  --  but only a few new developments have actually begun . And a recent impact study by the planning department of Westmoreland County , where the plant is located , forecasts that VW 's arrival wo n't bring any drastic , immediate changes . " This area 's economy has been growing , and VW will spur further growth over the next 10 years . But it is n't going to be like the Alaska pipeline , " says Larry J. Larese , county planning director . Nonetheless , almost everybody agrees that some changes are inevitable . Conrad Donovan . secretary-treasurer of Mount Pleasant Township , a local community of 11,000 people , worries about how his town will deal with increased traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have a traffic light or a police force . That will have to change . " he says . A Couple With Regrets Such prospects cause particular anguish for Donald and Nancy Funk , for in a way they made the entire VW project here possible . In 1968 , the Funks sold their 117-acre farm to Chrysler for the plant . The sale brought them a bundle of money , instant local fame , a beautiful 72-acre farm nearby and plenty of regrets . With VW finally using the facility , " The peace and solitude of the country are gone , " says Mrs. Funk . The Funks now are thinking of selling their new farm and retiring . The plant with its jobs , however , probably will hold many more residents than it drives away in an area where the unemployment rate is about 7% . For instance , 21year-old Joseph Cappa , who was laid off last December from his job at a steel plant , has stayed in the hope of landing a place at VW . " If I do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cappa says . Keeping residents like Mr. Cappa is enough to justify the whole project , says Mount Pleasant Borough Mayor Potoka . " We 've been losing too many young people , " he says . The mayor also hopes the economic stimulus from the plant will bring a few bigcity amenities to his town of 6,000 . " We 've been hurting for fast-food restaurants , but they 'll come eventually , " he says .
