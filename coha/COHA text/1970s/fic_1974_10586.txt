I came East that June from Wisconsin , ostensibly toI'y participate as a staff member in a two-week writing workshop at Brooklyn College , I was as bereft of will as a zombie  --  except , as I discovered , the will to be done with my life . Waiting in the subway station for an approaching train , I suddenly found it advisable to wrap one hand around the links of a chain that anchored a battered penny weighing machine to the iron pillar beside me . Until the train had passed in and out of view , I squeezed that chain with all my strength . " I am dangling over a ravine , " I told myself . " I am being hoisted from the waves by a helicopter . Hang on ! " Afterward I scanned the tracks , to be certain that I had in fact succeeded in stifling this wholly original urge for Peter Tarnopol to be transformedinto a mangled corpse ; amazed , terrified , I had also , as they say , to laugh : " Commit suicide ? Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . " I still do n't know how near I may actually have come that day to springing across the platform and , in lieu of taking my wife head-on , taking on that incoming IRT train . It could be that I did n't have to cling to anything , that too could have been so much infantile posturing ; then again I may owe my survival to the fact that when I heard blessed oblivion hurtling my way , myright hand fortunately found something impressively durable to hang on to . At Brooklyn College over a hundred students were present in the auditorium for the opening session ; each member of the workshopstaff of four was to give a fifteen-minute address on " the art of fiction . " My turn came , I rose  --  and could n't speak . I stood at the lectern , notes before me  --  audience before me  --  without air in my lungs or saliva in my mouth . The audience , as I remember it , seemed to me to begin to hum . And all I wanted was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and give it a try . Neither was I entirely there . I was nothing but heartbeat , just that drum . Eventually I turned and left the stage . . . and the job . . . Once , in Wisconsin , after a weekend of quarreling with my wife ( shemaintained , over my objections , that I had talked too long to ap103pretty graduate student at a party on Friday night ; much discussion on the relativity of time ) , she had presented herself at the door of the classroom where I taught my undergraduate fiction seminar from seven to nine on Monday evenings . Our quarrel had ended at breakfast that morning with Maureen tearing at my hands with her fingernails ; I had not been back to our apartment since . " It 's an emergency ! " Maureen informed me  --  and the seminar . The ten middle western undergraduates looked first at her , standing so determinedly there in the doorway , and then with comprehension at my hands , marked with mercurochrome  --  " The cat , " I had explained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast . I rushed out into the corridor before Maureen had a chance to say more . There my sovereign delivered herself of that day 's manifesto : " You better come home tonight , Peter ! You better not go back to some room somewhere with one of those little blondes ! " ( This was the semester before I went ahead and did just that . ) " Get out of here ! " I whispered . " Go , Maureen , or I 'll throw you down those fucking stairs ! Go , before I murder you ! " My tone must have impressed her  --  she took hold of the banister and retreated a step . I turned back to the seminar room to find that in my haste to confront Maureen and send her packing , I had neglected to shut the door behind me . A big shy farm girl from Appleton , who had spoken maybe one sentence all semester , was staring fixedly at the woman in the corridor behind me ; the rest of the class stared into the pages of Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , " said the quavering voice that entered the room  --  an arm had violently flung the door shut in Maureen 's face , I 'm not wholly sure it was mine  --  " why does Mann send Aschenbach to Venice , rather than Paris , or Rome , or Chicago ? " Here the girl from Appleton dissolved into tears , and the others , usually not that lively , began answering the question all at once . . . I did not recall every last detail of this scene as I stood yearning for sleep before my expectant audience at Brooklyn College , but it accounts , I think , for the vision that I had as I stepped to the lectern to deliverp104my prepared address : I saw Maureen , projected like a bullet through the rear door of the auditorium , and shouting at the top of her lungs whatever revelation about me had just rolled off the presses . Yes , to that workshop audience that took me to be an emerging literary figure , a first novelist whose ideas about writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( withoutcharge ) that I was not at all as I would present myself . To whatever words , banal or otherwise , that I spoke from the platform , she would cry , " Lies ! Filthy , self-serving lies ! " I could ( as I intended to ) quote Conrad , Flaubert , Henry James , she would scream all the louder , " Fraud ! " But I spoke not a syllable , and in my flight from the stage , seemed to be only what I was  --  terrified , nothing any longer but my fears . My writing by this time was wholly at the mercy of our marital confusion . Five and six hours a day , seven days a week , I went off to my office at the university and ran paper through the roller of my typewriter ; the fiction that emerged was either amateurishly transparent  --  . Imight have been drawing up an IOU or writing the instructions for the back of a detergent box for all the imagination I displayed  --  or , alternately , so disjointed and opaque that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manuscript in hand , would drag myself around the little room , like some burdened figure broken loose from Rodin 's " Bourgeois of Calais , " crying aloud , " Where was I when this was written ? " And I asked because I did n't know . These pounds and pounds of pages that I accumulated during the marriage had the marriage itself as the subject and constituted the major part of the daily effort to understand how I had fallen into this trap and why I could n't get out . Over the three years I had tried easily a hundred different ways to penetrate that mystery ; every other week the whole course of the novel would change in midsentence , and within any one month the surface of my desk would disappear beneath dozens of equally dissatisfying variants of the single unfinished chapter that was driving me mad . Periodi/tally I would take all these pages  --  " take " is putting it mildly  --  and consign them to the liquor carton filling up with false starts at the bottom of my closet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first sentence of the book . How I struggled for a description . ( And , alas , struggle still . ) But from one version to the next nothing of consequence ever happened : locales shifted , peripheral characters ( parents , old flames , comforters , enemies , and allies ) came and went , and with about as much hope for success as a man attacking the polar ice cap with his own warm breath , I would attempt to release a flow of invention in me by changing the color of her eyes or my hair . Of course , to give up the obsession would surely have made the most sense ; only , obsessed , I was as incapable of not writing about what was killing me as I was of altering or understanding it . So : hopeless at my work and miserable in my marriage , with all the solid achievements of my early twenties gone up in smoke , I walked off the stage , too stupefied even for shame , and headed like a sleepwalker for the subway station . Fortunately there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  rather than riding over me  --  and within the hour I was deposited at the Columbiacampus stop only a few blocks from my brother Morris 's apartment . My nephew Abner , surprised and pleased to ' see me in New York , offered me a bottle of soda and half of his salami sandwich . " I 've got a cold , " he explained , when I asked in a breaking voice what he was doing home from school . He showed me that he was reading Invisible Man with his lunch . " Do you really know Ralph Ellison , Uncle Peppy ? " " I met him once , " I said , and then I was bawling , or barking ; tears streamed from my eyes , but the noises that I made were novel even to me . " Hey , Uncle Pep , what 's the matter ? " " Get your father . " " He 's teaching . " " Get him , Abbie . " So the boy called the university  --  " This is an emergency ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of class and home in minutes . I was in the bathroom by this time ; Moe pushed right on in , and then , bigp106two-hundred pounder though he is , kneeled down in that tiny tiled room beside the toilet , where I was sitting on the seat , watery feces running from me , sweating and simultaneously trembling as though I were packed in ice ; every few minutes my head rolled to the side and I retched in the direction of the sink . Still , Morris pressed his bulk against my legs and held my two limp hands in his ; with a rough , rubbery cheek he wiped the perspiration from my brow . " Peppy , ah , Peppy , " he groaned , calling me by my childhood nickname and kissing my face . " Hang on , Pep , I 'm here now . " A word about my brother and sister , very different creatures from myself . I am the youngest of three , always " the baby " in everyone 's eyes , right down to today . Joan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has lived most of her adult life in California with her husband Alvin , a land developer , and their four handsome children . Says Morris of our sister : " You would think she 'd been born in a Boeing jet instead of over the store in the Bronx . " Alvin Rosen , my brother-in-law , is six foot two and intimidatingly handsome , particularly now that his thick curls have turned silvery ( " My father thinks he dyes it that color , " Abner once told me in disgust ) and his face has begun to crease like a cowboy 's ; from all the evidencehe seems pretty much at one with his life as Californian , yachtsman , skier , and real estate tycoon , and utterly content with his wife and his children . He and my trim stylish sister travel each year to places slightly off the main tourist route ( or just on the brink of being " discovered " ) ; only recently my parents received postcards from their granddaughter , Melissa Rosen , Joannie 's tenyear-old , postmarked Africa ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small boat had carried friends and family on a week-long journey up the Amazon , a famous Stanford naturalist serving as their guide ) . They throw open their house for an annual benefit costume party each year in behalf of Bridges , the West Coast literary magazine whose masthead lists Joan as one of a dozenp107advisory editors  --  frequently they are called upon to bail the magazineout of financial trouble with a timely donation from the Joan and Alvin Rosen Foundation ; they are also generous contributorsto hospitals and libraries in the Bay Area and among the leading sponsors of an annual fund drive for California 's migrant workers ( " Capitalists , " says Morris , " in search of a conscience . Aristocrats in overalls . Fragonard should paint ' em . " ) ; and they are good parents , if the buoyancy and beauty of their children are any indication . To dismiss them ( as Morris tends to ) as vapid and frivolous would be easier if their pursuit of comfort , luxury , beauty , and glamor ( they number a politically active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such openness and zest , with a sense that they had discovered the reason for being . My sister , after all , was not always so fun loving and attractive or adept at enjoying life . In 1945 , as valedictorian of Yonkers High , she was a hairy , hawk-nosed , undernourished-looking little " grind " whose braininess and sallow homeliness had made her just about the least popular girl in her class ; the consensus then was that she would be lucky to find a husband , let alone the rich , lanky , Lincolnesque Wharton School graduate , Alvin Rosen , whom she carried away from the University of Pennsylvania along with her A.B . in English . But she did it  --  not without concentrated effort , to be sure . Electrolysison the upper lip and along the jawbone , plastic surgery on the nose and chin , and the various powders and paints available at the drugstore have transformed her into a sleek , sensual type , still Semitic , but rather more the daughter of a shah than a shopkeeper . Driving around San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pampas one day and a Bulgarian peasant the next , has gained her in her middle years something more than mere popularity  --  according to the society page of the San Francisco paper ( also sent on to my mother by little Melissa ) Joan is " the most daringand creative tastemaker " alive out there . The photograph of her , with Alvin in velvet on . one bare arm and the conductor of the San Francisco Symphony on the other ( captioned , by Melissa ,  | " Mom at a party " ) , is simply staggering to one who remembers still that eight-by-ten glossy of the ' 45 senior prom crowd at Billy Rose 's Diamond Horseshoe in New York  --  there sits Joan , all nose and shoulder blades , adrift in a taffeta " strapless " into which it appears she will momentarily sink out of sight , her head of coarse dark hair ( since straightened and shined so that she glows like Black Beauty ) mockingly framed by the Amazonian gams of the chorus girl up on the stage behind her ; as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ringside " table , was her date , the butcher 's large shy son , bemusedly looking down into a glass with a Tom Collins in it . . . And this woman today is the gregarious glamor girl of America 's most glamorous city . To me it is awesome : that she should be on such good terms with pleasure , such a success at satisfaction , should derive so much strength and confidence from how she looks , and where she travels , and what she eats and with whom . . . well , that is no small thing , or so it seems to her brother from the confines of his hermit 's cell . Joan has recently written inviting me to leave Quahsay and come out to California to stay with her and her family for as long as I like . " We wo n't even bother you with our goatish ways , if you should just want to sit around the pool polishing your halo .

Or perhaps not  --  maybe what sent you into ecstasy over that word was how difficult it was . Truly , Pep , if your appetite for the disagreeable should ever slacken , I am here and so is the house . Your fallen sister , J. " For the record , my reply : Dear Joan : What 's disagreeable is n't being where I am or living as I do right now . This is the best place for me , probably for some time to come . I ca n't stay on indefinitely of course , but there are approxima/tions to this sort of life . When Maureen and I lived in New Milford , and I had that twelve-by-twelve shack in the woods behind the house  --  and a bolt to throw on the door  --  I could be content for hours on end . I have n't changed much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit alone in a room spelling things out as best I can with a pencil and paper . When I first got to New York in ' 62 , and my personal life was a shambles , I used to dream out loud in my analyst 's office about becomingagain that confident and triumphant college kid I was at twenty ; now I find the idea of going back beyond that even more appealing . Up here I sometimes imagine that I am ten  --  and treat myself accordingly . To start the day I eat a bowl of hot cereal in the dining room as I did each morning in our kitchen at home ; then I head out here to my cabin , at just about the time I used to go off to school . I 'm at work by eight forty-five , when " the first bell " used to ring . Instead of arithmetic , social studies , etc. , I write on the typewriter till noon . ( Just like my boyhood idol , Ernie Pyle ; actually I may have grown up to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that the front-line battles I report on are n't the kind I 'd had in mind . ) Lunch out of a lunch pail provided by the dining hall here : a sandwich , some carrot sticks , an oatmeal cookie , an apple , a thermos of milk . More than enough for this growing boy . After lunch I resume writing until three thirty , when " the last bell " used to ring at school . I straighten up my desk and carry my empty lunch pail ' back to the dining hall , where the evening 's soup is cooking . The smell of dill , mother 's perfume . Manchester is three miles from the Colony by way of a country road that curves down through the hills . There is a women 's junior college at the edge of town , and the girls are down there by the time I arrive . I see them inside the laundromat and at the post office and buying shampoo in the pharmacy  --  reminding me of the playground " after school , " aswarm with long-haired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with wonder . I admire them from afar and with wonder in the local luncheonette , where I go for a cup of coffee . I have been asked by one of the Englishprofessors at the college to speak to his writing class . I declined . I do n't want them any more accessible than they would be if I were back in the fifth grade . After my coffee I walk down the street to thep110town library and sit for a while leafing through the magazines and watching the schoolkids at the long tables copying their book reportsoff the jacket flaps . Then I go out and hitch a ride back up to the Colony ; I could n't feel any more trusting and innocent than when I hop out of the car and say to the driver , " Thanks for the ride  --  s'long ! " I sleep in a room on the second floor of the big three-story farmhousethat houses the guests ; on the main floor are the kitchen , dining hall , and the living room ( magazines , record player , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side porch , and that 's just about it . On the floor of my room , in my undershorts , I do half an hour of calisthenicsat the end of each afternoon . In the last six months , through dint of exercise and very little appetite , I have become just about as skinny as I was when you used to pretend to play the xylophone on my ribs . After " gym " I shave and shower . My windows are brushed by the needles of an enormous spruce ; that 's the only sound I hear while shaving , outside of the water running into the sink . Not a noise I ca n't account for . I try each evening to give myself a " perfect " shave , as a shaving ten-year-old might . I concentrate : hot water , soap , hot water , coat of Rise , with the grain , coat of Rise , against the grain , hot water , cold water , thorough investigation of all surfaces . . . perfect . The vodka martini that I mix for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my portable radio . ( I am on my bed in my bathrobe : face ivory smooth , underarms deodorized , feet powdered , hair combed  --  clean as a bridegroom in a marriage manual . ) The martini was of course not my habit at ten , but something like Dad 's when he came home with his headache ( and the day 's receipts ) from the store : looking as though he were drinking turpentine , he would toss down his shot of Schenley 's , and then listen in " his " chair to " Lyle Van and the News . " Dinner is eaten at six thirty here , in the company of the fifteen or so guests in residence at the moment , mostly novelists and poets , a few painters , one composer . Conversation is pleasant , or annoying , or dull ; in all , no more or less taxing than eating night after night with one 's family , though the family that comes to mind is n't ours so much as the one Chekhov assembled in Uncle Vanya . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever she gets going on somebody 's horoscope I want to jump up from the tablep111and get a pistol and blow her brains out . But as we are none of us bound by blood , law , or desire ( as far as I can tell ) , forbearance generallyholds sway . We drift after dinner into the living room , to chat and scratch the resident dog ; the composer plays Chopin nocturnes ; the New York Times passes from hand to hand . . . generally within the hour we have all drifted off without a word . My understanding is that with only five exceptions , all those in residence right now happen to be in flight , or in hiding , or in recovery  --  from bad marriages , divorces , and affairs . I have overheard tag ends of conversation issuing from the phone booth down in the kitchen to support this rumor . Two teacher-poets in their thirties who have just been through the process of divesting themselves of wives and children and worldly goods ( in exchange for student admirers ) have struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ordeal of giving up little sons and daughters . On the weekends when their dazzling studentgirl friends come to visit , they disappear into the bedsheets at the local motel for forty-eight hours at a clip . I recently began to play ping-pong again for the first time in twenty years , two or three fierce games after dinner with an Idaho woman , a stocky painter in her fifties who has been married five times ; one night last week ( only ten days after her arrival ) she drank everything she could find on the premises , including the vanilla extract in the cook 's pantry , and had to be taken away the next morning in a station wagon by the mortician who runs the local AA . We all left our typewriters to stand glumly out on the steps and wave goodbye . " Ah , do n't worry , " she called to us out the car window , " if it was n't for my mistakes I 'd still be back on the front porch in Boise . " She was our only " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirited of the survivors hereabouts . One night six of us went down into Manchester for a beer and she told us about her first two marriages . After she finished , the astrologist wanted to know her sign : the rest of us were trying to figure out how come she was n't dead . " Why the hell do you keep getting married , Mary ? " I asked her . She chucked me on the chin and said , " Because I do n't want to die shriveled up . " But she 's gone now ( probably to marry the mortician ) , and except for the muffled cries rising from the phone booth at night , it 's as quiet here as a hospital zone . Perfect for home/work . After dinner and the Times , I walk back out to my studio , one of twenty cabins scattered along a dirt road that winds through the two hundred acres of open fields and evergreen woods . In the cabin there 's a writing desk , a cot , a Franklin stove , a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wobbly wicker table where I eat lunch at noon . I read over what I 've written that day . Trying to read anything else is useless ; my mind wanders back to my own pages . I think about that or nothing , Walking back to the main house at midnight I have only a flashlightto help me make my way along the path that runs between the trees . Under a black sky by myself , I am no more courageous at thirtyfourthan I was as a boy : there is the urge to run . But as a matter of fact invariably I will turn the flashlight off and stand out there in the midnight woods , until either fear subsides or I have achieved something like a Mexican standoff between me and it . What frightens me ? At ten it was only oblivion . I used to pass the " haunted " Victorian houses on Hawthorne Avenue on my way home from Cub Scout meetings , reminding myself , There are no ghosts , the dead are dead , which was , of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought that the dead are n't that turns my knees to water . I think : the funeral was another trick  --  she 's alive ! Somehow or other , she will reappear ! Down in town in the late afternoon , I half expect to look into the laundromat and see her stuffing a machine with a bag of wash . At the luncheonette where I go for my cup of coffee , I sometimessit at the counter waiting for Maureen to come charging through the door , with finger pointed  --  " What are you doing in here ! You said you 'd meet me by the bank at four ! " " By the bank ? Four ? You ? " And we 're at it . " You 're dead , " I tell her , " you can not meet anyone by any bank if you are , as you are , dead ! " But still , you will have observed , I keep my distance from the pretty young students buying shampoo to wash their long hair . Who ever accused a shy ten-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or , for that matter , heard of a plaintiff who was ashes ? " She 's dead , " I remind myself , " and it is over . " But how can that be ? Defies credulity . If in a work of realistic fiction the hero was saved by something as fortuitous as the sudden death of his worst enemy , what intelligent reader would suspend his disbelief ?  |p113Facile  , he would grumble , and fantastic . Fictional wish fulfillment , fiction in the service of one 's dreams . Not True to Life . And I would agree . Maureen 's death is not True to Life . Such things simply do not happen , except when they do . ( And as time passes and I get older , I find that they do with increasing frequency . ) I 'm sending along Xerox copies of two stories I 've written up here , both more or less on the Subject . They 'll give you an idea as to why I 'm here and what I 'm doing . So far no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging things to say about both of them , but of course what he would like to see is that novel for which my publisheradvanced twenty thousand dollars back when I was a boy wonder . I know how much he would like to see it because he so scrupulously and kindly avoided mentioning it . He gave the game away , however , by inquiring whether " Courting Disaster " ( one of the two stories enclosed ) was going " to develop into a longer work about a guilt-ridden Zuckerman and his beautiful stepdaughter in Italy  --  a kind of post-Freudian meditation on themes out of Anna Karenina and Death in Venice . Is that what you 're up to , or are you planning to continue to write Zuckerman variations until you have constructed a kind of full-length fictional fugue ? " Good ideas all right , but what I am doing , I had to tell the man standing there holdingmy IOU , is more like trying to punch my way out of a paper bag .

It remains for the ego to come forward then and present its defense , for all parties to the **35;1429;TOOLONG have had their day in court . I realize now , as I entertain this idea , that the nonfiction narrative that I 'm currentlyworking on might be considered just that : the " I " owning up to its role as ringleader of the plot . If so , then after all testimony has been heard and a guilty verdict swiftly rendered , the conspiratorsp114will be consigned to the appropriate correctional institution . You suggest your pool .

Having been around the track with them once already , I would as soon consign my fate to the Marx Brothers or the Three Stooges ; buffoons , but they at least like one another . P.S. Do n't take personally the brother of " Salad Days " or the sister of " Courting Disaster . " Imaginary siblings serving the design of the fiction .

I believe the word was " noodle , " used as a synonym for " head . " You were merciless , somehow you managed to stick it somewhere into every sentence you uttered , and eventually I wet my pants . When Mother and Dad returned to the car I was outraged with you and in tears .

You did not kill her , in any way , shape , or form . Unless there is something I do n't know . 3 . To have asked a pretty girl to have intercourse with a zucchini in your presence is morally inconsequential . Everybody has his whims . You probably made her day ( if that was you ) . You announce it in your " Salad Days " story with all the bravado of a naughty boy who knows he has done wrong and now awaits with bated breath his punishment .

Awfully gruesome and oddly arbitrary , unless I am missing something . 6 . Idle curiosity : was Maureen seduced by her father ? She never struck me as broken in that way . 7 .

I found it much too proper a book , properly decorous and constrained on the formal side , and properly momentous ( and much too pointed ) in presenting its Serious Jewish Moral Issue . Obviously it was mature for a first novel  --  too obviously : the work of a gifted literature student straitjacketed by the idea that fiction is the means for proving righteousness and displaying intelligence ; the book seems to me very much a relic of the fifties . The Abraham and Isaac motif , rich with Kierkegaardian overtones , reeks ( if I may say so ) of those English departments located in the upper reaches of the Himalayas . What I like about the new stories , and why to my mind they represent a tremendous advance over the novel , is that they seem to me a deliberate and largely conscious twoprongedattack upon the prematurely grave and high-minded author of A Jewish Father . As I read it , in " Salad Days " the attack is frontal , head-on , and accomplished by means of social satire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a very different thing , say , from the pornography of a Sade or a Terry Southern . For the author ofp117that solemn first novel , a story like " Salad Days " is nothing less than blasphemous . He is to be congratulated heartily for triumphing ( at least here ) over all that repressive piety and fashionable Jewish angst . " Courting Disaster " is a more complicated case ( and as a result not so successful , in a purely literary sense ) . As I would like to read it , the story is actually a disguised critical essay by Tarnopol on his own overrated first book , a commentary and a judgment on all that principlednessthat is A Jewish Father 's subject and its downfall . Whether Tarnopol intended it or not , I see in Zuckerman 's devotion to Lydia ( its joylessness , its sexlessness , its scrupulosity , its madly ethical motive ) a kind of allegory of Tarnopol and his Muse . To the degree that this is so , to the degree that the character of Zuckerman embodiesand represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish Father , it is fascinating ; to the degree that Tarnopol is back on the angst kick , with all that implies about " moving " the reader , I think the story is retrograde , dull , and boring , and suggests that the conventional ( rabbinical ) side of this writer still has a stranglehold on what is reckless and intriguing in his talent . But whatever my reservations , " Courting Disaster " is well worth publishing , certainly in tandem with " Salad Days , " a story that seems to me the work of a brand new Tarnopol , who , having objectifiedthe high-minded moralist in him ( and , hopefully , banished him to Europe forevermore , there to dwell in noble sadness with all the other " cultural monuments and literary landmarks " ) , has begun at last to flirt with the playful , the perverse , and the disreputable in himself . If Sharon Shatzky is your brother 's new Muse , and a zucchini her magic wand , we may be in for something more valuable than still more fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My two cents worth , only because the story L. admires most seems to me smug and vicious and infuriating , all the more so for being so clever and winning . It is pure sadistic trash and I pray ( actually ) that Bridges does n't print it . Art is long , but the life of a little magazine is short , and much too short for this . I hate what he does with that suburban college girl  --  and I do n't even mean what Zucker/man ( the predictable prodigal son who ma/ors in English ) does but what the author does , which is just to twist her arm around behind her back and say , " You are not my equal , you can never be my equal  --  understand ? " Who does he think he is , anyway ? And why would he want to be such a thing ? How could the man who wrote " Courting Disaster " want to write a heartless little story like that ? And vice versa ? Because the long story is absolutely heartrending and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is why it works utterly . I was moved to tears by it ( but then I did n't perform brain surgery on it ) and moved to the most aching admiration for the man who could just conceive such a story . The wife , the daughter , the husband are painfully true ( I 'm sure because he made me sure ) , and I shall never forget them . And Zuckerman here is completely true too , sympathetic , interesting , a believable observer and center of feeling , all the things he has to be . In a strange way they were all sympathetic to me , even the awful ones . Life is awful . Yours , Franny . P.S. I apologize for saying that something your brother wrote is hateful . I do n't know him . And I do n't think I want to . There are enough Jekyll and Hydes around here as it is . You 're an older woman , tell me something . What 's the matter with men ? What do they want ? My brother Morris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to a letter inquiring about my welfare , had his own trenchant comments to make on " Courting Disaster "  --  comments not so unlike Joan 's . What is it with you Jewish writers ? Madeleine Herzog , Deborah Rojack , the cutie-pie castrator in After the Fall , and is n't the desirable shiksa of A New Life a kvetch and titless in the bargain ? And now , for the further delight of the rabbis and the reading public , Lydia Zuckerman , that Gentile tomato . Chicken soup in every pot , and a Grushenka in every garage . With all the Dark Ladies to choose from , you luftmenschen can really pick ' em . Peppy , why are you still wastingyour talent on that Dead End Kid ? Leave her to Heaven , okay ? I 'm speaking at Boston University at the end of the month , not that far from you . If you 're still up on the mountain , come down and stay at the Commander with me . My subject is " Rationality , Planning , andp119Gratification Deferral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as for c , would you , a leading contender for the title in the highly competitiveJewish Novelist Division , agree to give a black belt demonstrationin same to the assembled students of social behavior ? Peppy , enough with her already ! Back in 196o , following a public lecture I had delivered ( my first ) at Berkeley , Joan and Alvin gave a party for me at the house they had then up on a ridge in Palo Alto . Maureen and I had just returned to the U.S. from our year at the American Academy in Rome , and I had accepted a two-year appointment as " writer-inresidence " at the University of Wisconsin . In the previous twelve months I had become ( according to an article in the Sunday Times book section ) " the golden boy of American literature " ; for A Jewish Father , my first novel , I had received the Prix de Rome of the American Academy of Arts and Letters , a Guggenheim grant of thirty-eight hundred dollars , and then my invitation to teach at Wisconsin . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not my good fortune that surprised me at the age of twenty-seven . Some sixty or seventy of their friends had been invited by Joan and Alvin to meet me ; Maureen and I lost sight of one another only a few minutes after our arrival , and when she turned up at my side some time later I was talking rather self-consciously to an extremely seductive looking young beauty of about my own age , self-conscious precisely for fear of the scene of jealous rage that proximity to such a sexpot would inevitably provoke . Maureen pretended at first that I was talking to no one ; she wanted to go , she announced , all these " phonies " were more than she could take . I decided to ignore the remark  --  I did not know what else to do . Draw a sword and cut her head off ? I did n't carry a sword at the time . I carried a stone face . The beautiful girl  --  from her decolletage it would have appeared that she was somethingof a daring tastemaker herself ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries of a personal nature  --  the girl was asking me who my editor was . I told her his name ; I said he happened also to bep120a good poet . " Oh , how could you ! " whispered Maureen , and , her eyes all at once flooded with tears ; instantly she turned and disappeared into a bathroom . I found Joan within a few minutes and told her that Maureen and I had to go  --  it had been a long day and Maureen was n't feeling well . " Pep , " said Joan , taking my hand in hers , " why are you doing this to yourself ? " " Doing what ? " " Her , " she said . I pretended not to know what she was talking about . Just presented her with my stone face . In the taxi to the hotel , Maureen wept like a child , repeatedly hammering at her knees ( and mine ) with her little fists . " How could you embarrass me like that  --  how could you say that , with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You know damn well , Peter ! Say that Walter is your editor ! " " But he is . " " What about me ? " she cried . " You ? " " I 'm your editor  --  you know very well I am ! Only you refuse to admit it ! I read every word you write , Peter . I make suggestions . I correct your spelling . " " Those are typos , Maureen . " " But I correct them ! And then some rich bitch sticks her tits in your face and asks who your editor is and you say Walter ! Why must you demean me like this  --  oh , why did you do that in front of that empty-headed girl ? Just because she was all over you with those tits of hers ? Mine are as big as hers  --  touch them some day and you 'll see ! " " Maureen , not this , not again  --  ! " " Yes , again ! And again and again ! Because you will not change ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ! " " But I 'm your editor ! " " You 're not ! " " I suppose I 'm not your wife either ! Why are you so ashamed of me ! In front of those phonies , no less ! People who would n't look twice at you if you were n't this month 's cover boy ! Oh , you baby ! You infant ! You hopeless egomaniac ! Must you always be at the center of everything ? " The next morning , before we left for the airport , Joan telephoned to the hotel to say goodbye . " We 're always here , " she told me . " I know . " " If you want to come out and stay . " " Well , thank you , " I said , as formally as if I were acknowledging an offer from a perfect stranger , " maybe we 'll take you up on it sometime . " " I 'm talking about you . Just you . You do n't have to suffer like this , Peppy . You'rep121proving nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as I hung up , Maureen said , " Oh , you could really have all the beautifulgirls , could n't you , Peter  --  with your sister out procuring for you . Oh , she would really enjoy that , I 'm sure . " " What the hell are you talking about now ? " " That deprived little look on your face  --  ' Oh , if I was n't saddled with this witch , could n't I have a time of it , screwing away to my heart 's content at all the vapid twitteringingenues ! ' " " Again , Maureen ? Again ? Ca n't you at least let twenty-four hours go by ? " " Well , what about that girl last night who wanted to know who your editor was ? Oh , she really cared about that , I 'm sure . Well , be honest , Peter , did n't you want to fuck her ? You could n't take your eyes off those tits of hers . " " I suppose I noticed them . " " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as you , Maureen . " " Oh , do n't use your sardonic wit on me ! Admit it ! You did want to fuck her . You were dying to fuck her . " " The fact of it is , I was close to catatonic in her presence . " " Yes , suppressing all that goddam lust ! How hard you have to work to suppress it  --  with everybody but me ! Oh , admit it , tell the truth for once  --  if you had been alone , you know damn well you would have had her back here in this hotel ! On this very bed ! And she at least would have gotten laid last night ! Which is more than I can say for me ! Oh , why do you punish me like this  --  why do you lust after every woman in this whole wide world , except your own wife . " My family . . . In marked contrast to Joan and Alvin and their children Mab , Melissa , Kim , and Anthony , are my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twins , Abner and Davey . In their home the dominant social concern is not with the accumulation of goods , but the means by which society can facilitate their equitable distribution . Morris is an authority on underdeveloped nations ; his trips to Africa and the Caribbean are conducted under the auspices of the UN Commission for Economic Rehabilitation , one of several international bodies to which Moe serves as a consultant . He is a man who worries over everything , but nothing ( excluding his family ) , nothing so much as social and economic inequality ; what is now famous as " the culture of poverty " has been a heartbreaking obsession with him since the days he used to come home cursing with frustration from his job with the Jewish Welfare Board in the Bronx  --  during the late thirties , he worked there days while going to school nights at N.Y.U. After the war he married an adoring student , today a kindly , devoted , nervous , quiet woman , who some years ago , when the twins went off to kindergarten , enrolled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master 's degree . She is now a librarian for the city of New York . The twins are fifteen ; last year both refused to leave the local upper West Side public school to become students at Horace Mann . On two consecutive days they were roughed up and robbed of their pennies by a Puerto Rican gang that has come to terrorize the corridors , lavatories , and basketball courts back of their school  --  nonetheless , they have refused to become " private school hypocrites , " which is how they describe their neighborhood friends , the sons and daughters of Columbia faculty who have been removed from the local schools by their parents . To Morris , who worries continuously for their safety , the children shout indignantly , " How can you , of all people , suggest Horace Mann ! How can you betray your own ideals ! You 're just as bad as Uncle Alvin ! Worse ! " Moe has , as he says , only himself to congratulate for their moral heroics ; ever since they could understand an English sentence , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this rich country is run . The history of the postwar years , with particular emphasis upon continuing social injustice and growing political repression , has been the stuff of their bedtime stories : instead of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , the strange adventures of Martin Dies and the House Un-American Activities Committee ; instead of Pinocchio , Joe McCarthy ; instead of Uncle Remus , tales of Paul Robeson and Martin Luther King . I ca n't remember once eating dinner at Moe 's , that he was not conductingp123a seminar in left-wing politics for the two little boys wolfing down their pot roast and kasha  --  the Rosenbergs , Henry Wallace , Leon Trotsky , Eugene Debs , Norman Thomas , Dwight Macdonald , George Orwell , Harry Bridges , Samuel Gompers , just a few whose names are apt to be mentioned between appetizer and dessert  --  and , simultaneously , looking to see that everybody is eating what is best for him , pushing green vegetables , cautioning against soda pop gulped too quickly , and always checking the serving bowls to be sure there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , who has been on her feet all day herself , and like an enormous lineman going after a loose fumble , rushes into the kitchen to get another quarter pound of butter from the refrigerator . " A glass of ice water , Pop ! " calls Abner . " Who else for ice water ? Peppy ? You want another beer ? I 'll bring it anyway . " His big paws full , he returns to the table , distributes the goods , waving for the boys to go on with what they were saying  --  intently he listens to them both , the one little boy arguing that Alger Hiss must have been a Communist spy , while the other ( in a voice even louder than his brother 's ) tries to come to grips with the fact that Roy Cohn is a Jew . It was to this household that I went to collapse . Moe , at my request , telephoned Maureen the first night after the Brooklyn College episode to say that I had been taken ill and was resting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ; when Moe said , " He just ca n't talk now , " she replied that she was getting on the next plane and coming East . Moe said , " Look , Maureen , he ca n't see anybody right now . He 's in no condition to . " " I 'm his wife ! " she reminded him . " But he can not see anybody . " " What is going on there , Morris , behind my back ? He is not a baby , no matter how you people think of him . Are you listening to me ? I demand to speak to my husband ! I will not be put off by somebody who wants to play big brother to a man who has won the Prix de Rome ! " But he was not intimidated , my big brother , and hung up . At the end of two days of hiding behind his bulk , I told Moe I was " myself " again ; I was going back to the Midwest . We hadp124rented a cabin for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anxious to get out of the apartment in Madison and up to the woods . I said I had to get back to my novel . " And to your beloved , " he reminded me . Moe made no secret ever of how much he disliked her ; Maureen maintained that it was because , unlike his own wife , she , one , was a Gentile , and , two , had a mind of her own . I tried to give him the same stone face that I had given my sister when she had criticizedmy marriage and my mate . I had n't yet told Moe , or anyone , what I had learned from Maureen two months earlier about the circumstances under which we had married  --  or about my affairwith an undergraduate that Maureen had discovered . I just said , " She 's my wife . " " So you spoke to her today . " " She 's my wife , what do you expect me to do ! " " She telephoned and so you picked it up and talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah , you jerk-off ! And do me a favor , will you , Peppy ? Stop telling me she 's your wife .

I do n't want my kid brother cracking up  --  do you understand that ? " " But I 'm fine now . " " Is that what your wife ' told you you were on the phone ? " " Moe , lay off . I 'm not a frail flower . " " But you are a frail flower , putz . You are a frail flower if I ever saw one ! Look , Peppy  --  you were a very gifted boy . That should be obvious . You stepped out into the world like a big , complicated , hypersensitive million-dollar radar system , and along came Maureen , flying her four-ninety-eight model airplane right smack into the middle of it , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on the fritz from all I can see ! " " I 'm twentyninenow , Moey . " " But you 're still worse than my fifteen-yearoldkids ! They 're at least going to get killed in behalf of a noble ideal ! But you I do n't understand  --  trying to be a hero with a bitchwho means nothing . Why , Peppy ? Why are you destroying your young life for her ? The world is full of kind and thoughtful and pretty young girls who would be delighted to keep a boy withp125your bella figura company . Peppy , you used to take them out by the dozens ! " I thought ( not for the first time that week ) of the kind and thoughtful and pretty young girl , my twenty-year-old student Karen Oakes , whose mistake it had been to involve herself with a Bluebeard like me . Maureen had just that afternoon  --  during the course of our fifth phone conversation of the hour ; if I hung up , she just called back , and I felt duty bound to answer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school for Karen  --  " that sweet young thing , with her bicycle and her braids , blowing her creative writing teacher ! "  --  if I did not get on a plane and come home " instantly . " But it was n't to prevent the worst from happeningthat I was returning ; no , whatever reckless act of revenge I thought I might forestall by doing as I was told and coming home , I was not so deluded as to believe that life with Maureen would ever get better . I was returning to find out what it would be like when it got even worse . How would it all end ? Could I imagine the grand finale ? Oh , I could , indeed . In the woods of Michigan she would raise her voice about Karen , and I would split her crazy head open with an ax  --  if , that is , she did not stab me in my sleep or poison my food , first . But one way or another , I would be vindicated . Yes , that was how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of reasonable alternatives than a character in a melodrama or a dream . As if I ever had , with her . I never made it to Wisconsin . Over my protests , Moe went down in the elevator with me , got in the taxi with me , and rode with me all the way out to LaGuardia Airport ; he stood directly behind me in the Northwest ticket line , and when his turn came , bought a seat on the same plane I was to take back to Madison . " You going to sleep in bed with us too ? " I asked , in anger . " I do n't know if I 'll sleep , " he said , " but I 'll get in there if I have to . " Whereupon I collapsed for the second time . In the taxi back to Manhattan I told him , through my tearful blubbering , about the deception that Maureen had employed to get me to marry her.  | " Good Christ , " he moaned , " you were really up against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? " I had my face pressed into his chest , and he was holding me in his two arms . " And you were still going back to her , " he said , now with a groan . " I was going to kill her , Moey ! " " You ? You were ? " " Yes ! With an ax ! With my bare hands ! " " Oh , I 'll bet . Oh , you poor , pussywhipped bastard , I 'll just bet you would have . " " I would have , " I croaked through my tears . " Look , you 're just the same as when you were a kid . You can give it , but you ca n't take it . Only now , on top of that , you ca n't give it either . " " Oh , why is that ? What happened ?

She sounds to me just from our phone conversation like one of the great professors in the subject . " " Yes ? " You see , driving back from the airport that day I felt like somebody being filled in on what had transpired on earth during the sabbatical year he had just spent on Mars ; I could have just stepped off a space ship , or out of steerage  --  I felt so green and strange and lost and dumb . By late afternoon I was in Dr. Spielvogel 's office ; out in the waitingroom Moe sat like a bouncer with his arms folded and his feet planted solidly on the floor , watching to be sure I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maureen was on her way East . Within two days I had notified the chairman of my departmentthat I would be unable to return to my job in the fall . By the end of the week Maureen  --  having failed in several attempts to get past the door to Moe 's apartment  --  had returned to Madison , cleared our stuff out of our apartment , and come East a second time ; she moved into a hotel for transients on lower Broadway , and there she intended to remain , she said , until I had let go of myp127brother 's apron strings and returned to our life together . Failing that , she said , she would do what I was " forcing " her to do through the courts . She told me on the phone ( when it rang , I picked it up , Moe 's instructions to the contrary notwithstanding ) that my brother was a " woman hater " and my new analyst a " fraud .

" " Oh , Jesus , " she moaned , " oh Jesus  --  have n't you ever heard of love ? " SUSAN : 1963  --  1966wife I had taken , entirely against my inclinations but in accordance with my principles , back in 1959 . Free to take a new one , if I so desired . Susan 's own absurd marriage to the right Princeton boy had also ended with the death of her mate . It had been briefer eventhan my own , and also childless , and she wanted now to have afamily before it was " too late . " She was into her thirties and frightenedof giving birth to a mongoloid child ; I had n't known how frighteneduntil I happened by accident to come upon a secret stockpile of biology books that apparently had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stuffed in a splitting carton on the floor of the pantry where I had gone in search of a fresh can of coffee one morning while Susan was off at her analyst 's . I assumed at first that they were books she had accumulated years ago at school ; then I noticed that two of them , The Basic Facts of Human Heredity by Amram Scheinfeld and Human Heredity by Ashley Montagu , had n't been published until she was alreadyliving alone and widowed in her New York apartment . It is now nearly a year since I decided that I would not marry Susan McCall and ended our long love affair . Until last year marrying Susan had been legally impossible because Maureen continued to refuse to grant me a divorce under the existing New York State matrimonial laws or to consent to a Mexican or outof-statedivorce . But then one sunny morning ( only one short year ago ) , Maureen was dead , and I was a widower , free at last of thep129Chapter Six of the Montagu book , " The Effects of Environment Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily marked with a black crayon , whether by Susan , or by whoever had owned the book before her , I had no sure way of knowing . " Studies of the reproductive development of the female show that from every point of view the best period during which the female may undertake the process of reproduction extends on the average from the age of twenty-one to about twenty-six years of age .. . . From the age of thirty-five years onward there is a sudden jump in the number of defective children that are born , especially of the type known as mongoloids . . . . In mongolism we have the tragic example of what may be an adequately sound genetic system being provided with an inadequate environment with resulting disordereddevelopment in the embryo . " If it was not Susan who had done the heavy underlining , it was she who had copied out into the margin , in her round , neat schoolgirlish hand , the words " an inadequate environment . " A single paragraph describing mongoloid children was the only one on the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crayon ; in its own simple and arresting way , however , it gave evidence of having been read no less desperately . The seven words that I italicize here had , in the book , been underlined by a yellow felt-tipped pen , the kind that Susan liked to use to encourage correspondents to believe that she was in the highest of spirits . " Mongoloid children may or may not have the fold of skin over the inner angle of the eye ( epicanthic fold ) or the flat root of the nose that goes with this , but they do have smallish heads , fissured tongues , a transverse palmar crease , with extreme intellectual retardation . Their I.Q. ranges between 15 and 29 points , from idiocy to the upper limit of about seven years . Mongoloids are cheerful and very friendly personalities , with often remarkable capacities for imitation and memories for music and complex situations which far outrank their other abilities . The expectation of life at birth is about nine years . "  |p130After  almost an hour with these books on the pantry floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Susan again that evening said nothing about them . Nothing to her , but thereafter I was as haunted by the image of Susan buying and reading her biology books as she was of giving birth to a monstrosity . But I did not marry her . I had no doubt that she would be a lovingand devoted mother and wife , but first place , I had deep misgivings about windingup imprisoned once again . During the four years that Maureenand I had been separated , her lawyer had three times subpoenaedme to appear in court in an attempt to get Maureen 's alimonypayments raised and my " hidden " bank accounts with their hidden millions revealed to the world . On each occasion I appeared , assummoned , with my packet of canceled checks , my bank statements , and my income tax returns to be grilled about my earningsand my expenses , and each time I came away from those proceedingsswearing that I would never again put authority over my personal life into the hands of some pious disapproving householder known as a New York municipal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless as to allow some burgher in black robes to tell me that I ought to " switch " to writing movies so as to make sufficient money to support the wife I had " abandoned . " Henceforth I would decide with whom I would live , whom I would support , and for how long , and not the state of New York , whose matrimoniallaws , as I had experienced them , seemed designed to keepa childless woman who refused to hold a job off the public dole , while teaching a lesson to the husband ( me ! ) assumed to have " abandoned " his innocent and helpless wife for no other reasonthan to writhe in the fleshpots of Sodom . At those prices , wouldthat it were so ! As my tone suggests , I had found myself as humiliated andp131compromised , and nearly as disfigured , by my unsuccessful effort to get unmarried as I had ever been by the marriage itself : over the four years of separation I had been followed to dinner by detectives , served with subpoenas in the dentist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , labeled for what seemed like all eternity " a defendant , " and judged by a man with whom I would not eat my dinner  --  and I did not know if I could undergo these indignities again , and the accompanying homicidal rage , without a stroke finishing me off on the witness stand . Once I even took a swing at Maureen 's dapper ( and , let it be known , elderly ) lawyer in the corridor of the courthouse , when I learned that it was he who had invited the reporter from the Daily News to attend the hearing at which Maureen ( for the occasion , in Peter Pan collar and tears ) testified that I was " a well-known seducer of college girls . " But that story of my swashbuckling in its turn . My point is that I had not responded with much equanimity to the role in which I was cast by the authorities and did not want to be tested by their system of sexual justice ever again . But there were other , graver reasons not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had never taken lightly Susan 's history of emotional breakdown , the fact is that as her lover it had not weighed upon me as I expected it would if I were to become her husband and her offspring 's father . In the years before we met , Susan had gone completely to pieces on three occasions : first , in her freshman ( and only ) year at Wellesley ; then after her husband had been killed in a plane crash eleven months into their marriage ; and most recently , when her father , whom she had doted upon , had died in great pain of bone cancer . Each time she fell into a kind of waking coma and retired to a corner ( or a closet ) to sit mutely with her hands folded in her lap until someone saw fit to lift her onto a stretcher and carry her away . Under ordinary circumstances she managed to put down what she called her " everyday run-of-the-mill terror " with pills : she had through the years discovered a pill for just about every phobiap132that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been living on them , or not-living on them , since she had left home for college . There was a pill for the classroom , a pill for " dates , " a pill for buying clothes , a pill for returning clothes , and needless to say , pills for getting started in the morning and dropping into oblivion at night . And a whole mixed bag of pills which she took like M &Ms; when she had to converse , even on the phone , with her formidable mother . After her father 's death she had spent a month in Payne Whitney , where she 'd become the patient of a Dr. Golding , reputedlya specialist with broken china . He had been her analyst for two years by the time I came along and had by then gotten her off everything except Ovaltine , her favorite childhood narcotic ; in fact , he had encouraged the drinking of Ovaltine at bedtime and during the day when she was feeling distressed . Actually during the course of our affair Susan did not take so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one that might have served to assure me that that past was past . But then so had her record been " perfect " when she had enrolled at Wellesley at the age of eighteen , an A student from Princeton 's Miss Fine 's School for Young Ladies , and immediately developed such a fear of her German professor , a caustic young European refugee with a taste for leggy American girls , that instead of going off to his class she took a seat in the closet of her room every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday at ten A.M. , and until the hour was over , hid out there , coasting along on the belladonna that she regularly obtained from Student Health for her menstrual cramps . By chance one day ( and a merciful day it was ) a dormitory chambermaid opened the closet door during Susan 's German hour , and her mother was summoned from Princeton to take her out from behind her winter coats and away from Wellesley for good . The possibility of such episodes recurring in the future alarmed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan 's history of breakdowns was largely what had intrigued me andp133attracted me , and that my apprehension over what might happen to her , given the inevitable tensions and pressures of marriage , was the first sign I had displayed , since coming of age , that I had a modicum of common sense in matters pertaining to women . My own attitude toward my apprehensiveness is not so unambiguously approving ; I still do not know from day to day whether it is cause for relief or remorse . Then there is the painful matter of the elusive orgasm : no matter how she struggled to reach a climax , " it " never happened . And of course the harder she worked at it , the more like labor and the less like pleasure erotic life became . On the other hand , the intensity of her effort was as moving as anything about her  --  for in the beginning , she had been altogether content just to open her legs a little way and lie there , a well to pump if anyone should want to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely and well formed as she was . It took much encouragement and , at the outset , much berating , to get her to be something more than a piece of meat on a spit that you turned this way and that until you were finished ; she was never finished , but then she had never really begun . What a thing it was to watch the appetite awaken in this shy and timid creature ! And the daring  --  for if only she dared to , she might actually have what she wanted ! I can see her still , teetering on the very edge of success . The pulse beats erratically in her throat , the jaw strains upward , the gray eyes yearn  --  just a yard , a foot , an inch to the tape , and victory over the self-denying past ! Oh yes , I remember us well at our honest toil  --  pelvises grinding as though to grind down bone , fingers clutching at one another 's buttocks , skin slick with sweat from forehead to feet , and our flushed cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one another that afterward her face is blotchy and bruised and my own is tender to the touch when I shave the following morning . Truly , I thought more than once that I might die of heart failure . " Though in a good cause , " I whisper , when Susan hadp134signaled at last a desire to throw in the towel for the night ; drawing a finger over the cheekbone and across the bridge of the nose , I would check for tears  --  rather , the tear ; she would rarely allow more than one to be shed , this touching hybrid of courage and fragility . " Oh , " she whispers , " I was almost almost almost . . . " " Yes ? " Then that tear . " Always , " she says , " almost . " " It 'll happen . " " It wo n't . You know it wo n't . What I consider almost is probably where everybody else begins . " " I doubt it . " " You do n't . . . Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . do it  --  harder . " So I did it , whatever it was , harder , or softer , or faster , or slower , or deeper , or shallower , or higher , or lower , as directed . Oh , how Mrs. Susan Seabury McCall of Princeton and Park Avenue tried to be bold , to be greedy , to be low ( " Put it . . . " " Yes , say it , Suzie  --  " " Oh , in me from behind , but do n't hurt  --  ! " )  --  not of course that living on bennies in a Wellesley dormitory in 1951 had n't constituted an act of boldness for a society-bred , mother-disciplined , father-pampered young heiress from a distinguished New Jersey family , replete on the father 's side with a U.S. senator and an ambassador to England , and on the mother 's , with nineteenth-century industrial barons . But that diversion had been devised to annihilate temptation ; now she wanted to want . . . Exhilarating to behold , but over the long haul utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of our affair both of us were the worse for wear and came to bed like workers doing overtime night after night in a defense plant : in a good cause , for good wages , but Christ how we wished the war was over and won and we could rest and be happy . I have of course to wonder now if Susan would n't have been better off if I had deferred to her and simply left her alone about coming . " I do n't care about that , " she had told me , when I first broached the distressing subject . I suggested that perhaps she should care . " Why do n't you just worry about your own fun . . . " said she . I told her that I was not worrying about " fun . " " Oh , do n't be pretentious , " she dared to mumble  --  then , begging : " Please , what difference does it make to you anyway ? " The difference , Ip135said , would be to her . " Oh , stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? I 'm just not a nymphomaniac and I never was . I am what I am , and if it 's been good enough for everyone else  --  " " Has it ? " " No ! " and out came the tear . So the resistance began to crumble , and the struggle , which I initiated and to which I was accomplice and accessory , began . I should point out here that the distressing subject had been a source of trouble between Maureen and myself as well : she too was unable to reach a climax , but maintained that what stood in her way was my " selfishness . " Characteristically she had confused the issue somewhat by leading me to believe for the longest while that she and orgasms were on the very best of terms  --  that I , in fact , had as much chance of holding her back as a picket fence has of obstructing an avalanche . Well into the first year of our marriage , I continued to look on in wonder at the crescendo of passion that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ejaculate ; you might even say that my ejaculations sort of faded off into nothing beside her clamorous writhings . It came as a surprise then ( to coin a phrase appropriate to these adventures ) to learn that she had actually been pretending , faking those operatic orgasms , she explained , so as to protect me from the knowledge of just how inadequate a lover I was . But how long could she keep up that pretense in order to bolster my sense of manliness ? What about her , she wanted to know . Thereafter I was to hear repeatedly how even Mezik , the brute who was her first husband , even Walker , the homosexual who was her second , knew more about how to satisfy a woman than the selfish , inept , questionableheterosexual who was I.Oh , you crazy bitch ( if the widower may take a moment out to address the ghost of his wife ) , death is too good for you , really . Why is n't there a hell , with fire and brimstone ? Why is n't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more ? Oh , if I were Dante , Maureen , I 'd go about writing this another way ! At any rate : in that Maureen 's accusations , no matter howp136patently bizarre , had a way of eating into my conscience , it very well might be that what Susan derided as my sexual good samaritanismwas in part an attempt by me to disprove the allegations brought against me by a monumentally dissatisfied wife . I do n't really know . I believe I meant well , though at the time I came to Susan there is no denying how dismayed I was by my record as a pleasure-giving man . Obviously what drew me to Susan to begin with  --  only a year into my separation and still reeling  --  was that in temperament and social bearing she was as unlike Maureen as a woman could be . There was no confusing Maureen 's recklessness , her instinct for scenes of wild accusation , her whole style of moral overkill , with Susan 's sedate and mannerly masochism . To Susan McCall , speakingaloud and at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like putting an elbow on the dinner table , something One Just Did n't Do . She told herself that by making her heartache her business and nobody else 's , she was being decorous and tactful , sparing another the inconsequential bellyaching of " a poor little rich girl , " though of course the person she was sparing ( and deluding ) by being so absurdly taciturn and stoically blind about her life was herself . She was the one who did n't want to hear about it , or think about it , or do anything about it , even as she continued to suffer it in her own resigned and baffled way . The two women were wholly antithetical in their response to deprivation , one like a dumb , frightened kid in a street fight who knows no way to save his hide but to charge into the melee , head down and skinny arms windmilling before him , the other docile and done in , resigned to being banged around or trampled over . Even when Susan came to realize that she need n't settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was n't simply " okay " with me ( and the rest of mankind ) that she exhibit a more robust appetite , but that it made her decidedly more attractive and appealing , there was the lifelong style of forbearance , abstemiousness in all things but pharmaceuticals , there was the fadeaway voice ,  |p137the  shy averted glance , the auburn hair drawn austerely back in a knot at the back of the slender neck , there was the bottomless patience , the ethereal silence , that single tear , to mark her clearly as a member of another tribe , if not another sex , from Maureen . It need hardly be pointed out that to me hers was a far more poignant struggle to witness ( and be a party to ) than that one in which Maureen had been so ferociously engaged  --  for where Maureen generally seemed to want to have something largely because someone else was able to have it ( if I had been impotent , there is no doubt she would have been content to be frigid ) , Susan now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman she had been . Her rival , the enemy whom she hoped to dispossess and drive into exile , if not extinction , was her own constrained and terrified self . Poignant , moving , admirable , endearing  --  in the end , too much for me . I could n't marry her . I could n't do it . If and when I was ever to marry again , it would have to be someone in whose wholenessI had abounding faith and trust . And if no one drawing breath was that whole  --  admittedly I was n't , my own capacity for faith and trust , among other things , in a state of serious disrepair  --  maybe that meant I would never remarry . So be it . Worse things had ad happened , one of them , I believed , to me . So : freed from Maureen by her death , it seemed to me that I had either to go ahead and make Susan a wife and mother at thirty-four , or leave her so that she might find a man who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's words , a totally " inadequate environment " for procreation . Having been to battle for nearly all of my adult life , first with Maureen and then with the divorce laws of the state of New York  --  laws so rigid and punitive they came to seem to me the very codification of Maureen 's " morality , " the work of her hand  --  I no longer had the daring , or the heart , or the confidence to marry again . Susan would have to find some man who was braver , or stronger , or wiser , or maybe just , more foolish and deludedp138Enough . I still do n't know how to describe my decision to leave her , nor have I stopped trying to . As I asked at the outset : Has anything changed ? Susan tried to kill herself six months after I had pronounced the affair over . I was here in Vermont . After I left her , my days in New York , till then so bound up with hers , had become pointless and empty . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become used to something more , this woman . As it turned out , I was no less lonely for her here in my cabin , but at least I knew that the chances were greatly reduced that she would show up in the Vermont woods at midnight , as she did at my apartment on West Twelfth Street , where she could call into the intercom , " It 's me , I miss you . " And what do you do at that hour , not let her in ? " You could , " Dr. Spielvogel advised me , " take her home in a taxi , yes . " " I did  --  at two . " " Try it at midnight . " So I did , came downstairs in my coat , to escort her out of the building and back to Park and Seventy-ninth . Sunday the buzzer went off in the morning . " Whois it ? " " I brought you the Times . It 's Sunday . " " I know it 's Sunday . " " Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday ? " I released the lock on the downstairs door ( " Take her home in a taxi ; there are taxis on Sunday "  --  " But I miss her ! " ) and she came on up the stairs , beaming , and invariably , Sunday after Sunday , we wound up making love in our earnest and strenuous way . " See , " says Susan . " What ? " " You do want me . Why are you acting as though you do n't ? " " You want to be married . You want to have children . And if that 's what you want you should have it . But I myself do n't , ca n't , and wo n't ! " " But I 'm not her . I 'm me . I 'm not out to torture you or coerce you into anything . Have I ever ? Could I possibly ? I only want to make you happy . " " I ca n't do it . I do n't want to . " " Then do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't say a word about it . You just said I ca n't do it and I have to go  --  and you went ! But this is intolerable . Not livingp139with you does n't make sense . Not even seeing each other  --  it 's just too bizarre . " " I do n't want to stand between you and a family , Susan . " " Oh , Peter , you sound like some dope on a soap opera when you say that . If I have to choose between you and a family , I choose you . " " But you want to be married , and if you want to be married , and if you want to have children , then you should have them . But I do n't , ca n't , and wo n't . " " It 's because I do n't come , is n't it ? And never will . Not even if you put it in my ear . Well , is n't it ? " " No . " " It 's because I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But it is that , it 's those pills I pop . You 're afraid of having somebody like me on your hands forever  --  you want somebody better , somebody who comes like the postman , through rain and snow and gloom of night , and does n't sit in closets and can live without her Ovaltine at the age of thirty-four  --  and why should n't you ? I would too , if I were you . I mean that . I understand completely . You 're right about me . " And out rolled the tear , and so I held her and told her no-no-it-isn't-so ( what else , Dr. Spielvogel , is there to say at that moment  --  yes , you 're absolutely correct ? ) . " Oh , I do n't blame you , " said Susan , " I 'm not even a person , really . " " Oh , what are you then ? " " I have n't been a person since I was sweet sixteen . I 'm just symptoms . A collection of symptoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued sporadically over a period of four months and would have gone on indefinitely , I thought , if I just stayed on there in New York . Certainly , I could refuse to respond to the doorbell , pretend when she came by that I was n't at home , but as I reminded Dr. Spielvogel when he suggested somewhatfacetiously that I " marshal " my strength and forget about the bell  --  " it 'll stop soon enough "  --  this was Susan I was dealing with , not Maureen . Eventually I packed a bag and , marshaling my strength , came up here . Just before I left my apartment , however , I spent several hours writing Susan notes telling her where I was going  --  and then tearing them up . But what if she " needed " me ? How could I just pickp140up and disappear ? I ended up finally telling a couple who were our friends where I would be hiding out , assuming that the wife would pass this confidence on to Susan before my bus had even passed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word from Susan for six weeks . Because she had been told where I was or because she had n't ? Then one morning I was summoned from breakfast to the phone here at the Colony  --  it was our friends informing me that Susan had been found unconscious in her apartment and rushed by ambulance to the hospital . It seemed that the previous night she had finally accepted an invitation to dinner with a man ; he had left her at her door around eleven , and she had come back into the apartment and swallowed all the Seconal and Tuinal and Placidyl that she had been secreting under her lingerie over the years . The cleaning lady had found her in the morning , befouledand in a heap on the bathroom floor , surrounded by empty vials and envelopes . I got an afternoon flight from Rutland and was at the hospital by the evening visiting hours . When I arrived at the psychiatric ward , I was told she had just been transferred and was directed to a regular private room . The door was slightly ajar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , gaunt and scraggly looking and still very obviously dazed and disoriented , like a prisoner , I thought , who has just been returned from an all-night session with her interrogators . When she saw that it was me rapping on the door , out came the tear , and despite the presence of the formidable mother , who coolly took my measure from the bedside , she said , " I love you , that 's why I did it . " After ten days the hospital getting her strength back  --  and assuring Dr. Golding when he came around to visit each morning , that she would never again lay in a secret cache of sleeping pills  --  she was released in the care of her mother and went back home to New Jersey , where her father had been a professor of classics at Princeton until his death . Mrs. Seabury , according to Susan ,  |p141was  a veritable Calpurnia ; in grace , in beauty , in carriage , in icy grandeur ( and , said Susan , " in her own estimation " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off , Susan added hopelessly , she happened also to be smart . Yes , top marks , it turned out , from the very college where Susan had n't been able to make it through her freshman year . I had always suspected that Susan might be exaggerating somewhat her mother 's majesty  --  it was , after all , her mother  --  but at the hospital , when by chance our daily visits overlapped , I found myself not a little awed by the patrician confidenceradiated by this woman from whom Susan had obviously inherited her own striking good looks , though not a Calpurnian presence . Mrs. Seabury and I had next to nothing to say to one another . She looked at me in fact ( or so I imagined it , in those circumstances ) as though she did not see there much opposition to be brooked . Only further evidence of her daughter 's prodigality . " Of course , " her silence seemed to me to say , " of course it would be over the loss of a hysterical Jewish poet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my suicidal mistress , it was difficult to rise to my own defense . When I came down to Princeton to visit Susan , we two sat in the garden back of the brick house on Mercer Street , next door to where Einstein had lived ( legend had it that as a little redheadedcharmer , back in the years before she was just " symptoms , " Susan used to give him candy to do her arithmetic homework ) ; Madame Seabury , wearing pearls , sat with a book just inside the terrace door , no more than ten yards away  --  it was not A Jewish Father she was reading , I was sure . I had taken the train to Princetonto tell Susan that now that she was being looked after by her mother , I would be going back to Vermont . So long as she had been in the hospital , I had , at Dr. Golding 's suggestion , been deliberately vague about my plans . " You do n't have to tell her anything , one way or another . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she will , " Golding said ; " for the time being she 's content that she got you clown here . She wo n't push her luck . " " Not yet . But what aboutp142when she gets out ? What if she tries it again ? " " I 'll take care of that , " said Golding , with a businesslike smile meant to close off conversation . I wanted to say : " You did n't take such marvelous care of that ' last time ! " But who was the runaway lover to blame the devoted doctor for the castoff mistress 's suicide attempt ? It was a warmish March day , and Susan was wearing a clinging yellow jersey dress , looking very slinky for a young woman who generally preferred to keep her alluring body inconspicuous . Her hair , unknotted for the occasion , was a thick mane down her back ; a narrow band of girlish freckles faintly showed across the bridge of her nose and her cheekbones . She had been out in the sun every afternoon  --  in her bikini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She could not keep her hands from her hair , and continuously , throughout our conversation , took it from behind her neck and pulled it like a thick , auburn rope over either shoulder ; then , raising her chin just a touch , she would push the mass of hair back behind her neck with two open palms . The wide mouth and slightly protrusive jaw that gave a decisive and womanly quality to her delicate beauty , struck me suddenly as prehistoric , the sign of what was still raw and forceful in this bridled daughter of propriety and wealth . I had always found her beauty stirring , but never before had it seemed so thoroughly dominated by the sensuous . That was new . Where was Susan the interrogated prisoner ? Susan the mousy widow ? Susan the awesome mother 's downtrodden Cinderella ? All gone ! Was it having toyed with suicide and gotten away with it that gave her the courage to be so blatantly tempting ? Was it the proximity of the disapproving mother that was goading her on ? Or was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from matrimony ? Whatever , I was aroused . With her legs thrown over the filigreed arm of the white wroughtironchaise , Susan 's yellow dress rode high on her tanned thigh  --  I thought it must be the way she used to sit at age eight with Einstein , before she had begun to be educated by her fears.  |p143When  she shifted in the chaise , or simply raised her arms to fool with her hair , the edge of her pale underpants came into view . " Coming on very shameless , " I said . " For my benefit or your mother 's ? " " Both . Neither . " " I do n't think she thinks the world of me to begin with . " " Nor of me . " " Then that wo n't help any , will it ? " " Please , you 're coming on ' like somebody 's nanny . " Silence , while I watch that hair fan out in her two hands . One of her tanned legs is swinging to the slowest of beats over the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenario that I had constructed on the train coming down . I had not counted on a temptress , or an erection . " She always thought I had the makings of a whore anyway , " says Susan , frowning like any victimized adolescent . " I doubt that . " " Oh , are you siding with my mother these days ? It 's a regular phalanx . Only you 're the one who turned me against her . " " That tack wo n't work , " I said flatly . " What will then ? Living here in my old room like the crazy daughter ? Having college boys ask me for dates over the card catalogue in the library ? Watching the eleven o'clock news , with my Ovaltine and my mom ? What ever has worked ? " I did n't answer . " I ruin everything , " she announced . " You want to tell me that I do ? " " I want to tell you that Maureen does  --  still ! Now why did she have to go and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : uiyway , dying off on me this way ? Everything was really just fine , until she upped and departed this life . But out of her clutches , Peter , you 're even more haywire than you were in . Leaving me like that was crazy . " " I 'm not haywire , I 'm not crazy , and everything was not justp144fine . ' You were biding your time . You want to be married and a mother . You dream about it . " " You 're the one who dreams about it . You 're the one who 's obsessed with marriage . I told you I was willing to go ahead without  --  " " But I do n't want you going ahead without ' ! I do n't want to be responsible for denying you what you want . " " But that 's my worry , not yours . And I do n't want it any more , I told you that . If I ca n't , I wo n't . " " Yes ?  --  then what am I to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which books ? " " Your volumes on human heredity . " She winced . " Oh . " But the mildness of what she said next , the faint air of self-mockery , surprised me . And relieved me too , for in my impatience with what I took to be rather self-deluded assertionsabout living " without , " I had gone further than I 'd meant to . " Are they still around ? " she asked , as though it was a teddy bear that I 'd uncovered from a secret hiding place . " Well , I did n't move them . " " I was going through a stage . . . as they say . " " What stage ? " " Pathetic . Morbid . Blue . That stage . . . When did you find them ? " " One morning . Only about a year ago . " " I see . . . Well  --  " All at once she seemed crushed by my discovery ; I thought that she might scream . " Well , " she said , inhalingdeeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out about me ? " I shook my head . " You should know  --  " she stopped . I said nothing . But what should I know ? What should I know ? " A Princeton hippie , " said Susan , slyly smiling , " is taking me to a movie tonight . You should know that . " " Very nice , " I said . " A new life . " " He picked me up at the library . Want to know what I 'm readingthese days ? "  | " Sure . What ? " " Everything about matricide I can get my hands on , " she told me , through her teeth . " Well , reading about matricide in a college library never killed anybody . " " Oh , I just went there because I was bored . " " In that dress ? " " Yes , in this dress . Why not ? It 's just a little dress to wear around the stacks , you know . " " I can see that . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who ? " " My hippie . He 'd probably dig ' a two-headed baby . And a decrepit old lady . ' " " That thigh staring me and your mother in the face does n't look too decrepit . " " Oh , " said Susan , " it wo n't kill you to look at it . " " Oh , it 's not killing me , " I said , and suppressed an urge to reach out and up and stroke what I saw . " Okay , " she said abruptly  --  " you can tell me what you came to tell me , Peter . I 'm ready . ' To use a serviceable phrase of my mother 's , I 've come to grips with reality . Shoot . You 're never going to see me again . " " I do n't see what 's changed , " I answered . " You do n't  --  I know you do n't . You still think I 'm Maureen . You still think I 'm that terrible person . " " Hardly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never trusting anyone ever again just because of a screwball like that ! I do n't lie , Peter . I do n't deceive . I 'm me . And do n't give me that look . " " What look ? " " Oh , let 's go up to my bedroom . The hell with Mother . I want to make ake love to you , terribly . " " What look ? " She closed her eyes . " Stop , " she whispered . " Do n't be furiousp146with me . I swear to you , I did n't mean it that way . It was not blackmail , truly . I just could not bear any longer Being Brave . " " Then why did n't you call your doctor  --  instead of taking Maureen 's favorite home remedy ! " " Because I did n't want him  --  I wanted you . But I did n't pursue you , did I ? For six weeks you were up there in Vermont , and III ' did n't write , and I did n't phone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? Instead I went around day after day Being Brave , and not in Vermont either , but in the apartment where I used to eat andI 'll sleep with you . Finally I even came to grips with reality and acceptedan invitation for dinner  --  and that was my biggest mistake . I tried to Start My Life Again , just like Dr. Golding told me to , and this very upright man that I went out with went ahead and gave me a lecture on how I ought n't to depend upon people who were lacking in integrity . ' He told me that he heard from a reliable source in publishing that you were lacking in integrity . Oh , he made me furious , Peter , and I told him I was going home , and so he got up and left with me , and when I got home I wanted to call you so , I wanted to speak to you so badly , and the only way I could n't do it was to take the pills . I know it makes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never ever do it again . You do n't know how sorry I am . And you may tell yourself that I did it out of anger with you , or to try to blackmail you , or to punish you , or because I actually took what that man said about you to heart  --  but it was none of that . It was just that I was so worn down from going around for six weeks Being Brave ! Oh , let 's go somewhere , to a motel room or somewhere . I want terribly to be fucked . That 's all I 've been thinking about down here for days . I feel like  --  a fiend . Oh , please , I 'm going to scream , living with this mother of mine ! " Here that mother of hers was out through the terrace doors , across the patio , and into the garden before Susan could even brush away the tear or I could respond to her appeal . And what response would I have made ? Her explanation did seem to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not lie or deceive ,  |p147of  course she was not Maureen . If I did n't want Susan , I realized then , it was not because I did n't want her to sacrifice for me her dream of a marriage and a family ; it was because I did n't want Susan any more , under any conditions . Nor did I want anyone else . I wanted only to be placed in sexual quarantine , to be weaned from the other sex forever . Yet everything she said was so convincing . Mrs. Seabury asked if I could come inside with her a moment . " I take it , " she said , when we were standing together just inside the terrace doors , " that you told her you do n't plan to see her again . " " That 's right . " " Then perhaps the best thing now would be to go . " " I think she 's expecting me to take her to lunch . " " She has no such expectation that I know of . I can see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan was now standing up beside the chaise . Both Mrs. Seabury and I were looking her way when she pulled the yellow jersey dress up over her head and let it fall to the lawn . It was n't pale underpants I 'd seen earlier beneath the skimpy dress , but a white bikini . She adjusted the back rest of the chaise until it was level with the seat and the foot rest , and then stretched herself out on it , face down . An arm hung limply over either side . Mrs. Seabury said , " Staying any longer will only make it more difficult for her . It was very good of you , " she said in her cool and unruffled way , " to visit her at the hospital every day . Dr. Golding agreed . That was the best thing to do in the situation , and we appreciateit . But now she must really make an effort to come to grips with reality . She must not be allowed to continue to act in ways that are not in her own interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her helplessness . She has been wooing people that way all her life . I tell you this for your own good  --  you must not imagine yourself in any way responsible for Susan 's predicament . She has always been all too willing to collapse in other people'sp148arms . We have tried to be kind and intelligent about this behavior always  --  she is what she is  --  but one must also be firm . And I do n't think it would be kind , intelligent , or firm for you to forestall theIII inevitable any longer . She must begin to forget you , and the sooner the better . I am going to ask you to go now , Mr. Tarnopol , before my daughter once again does something that she will regret . She can not afford much more remorse or humiliation . She has n't the stamina for it . " Out in the garden , Susan had turned over and was lying now on her back , her legs as well as her arms dangling over the sides of the chaise  --  four limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll go out and say goodbye . I 'll tell her I 'm going . " " I could as easily tell her you 've gone . She knows how to be weak but she also knows something about how to be strong . It 's a matter of continually making it clear to her that people are riot going to be manipulated by the childish ploys of a thirty-four-yearoldwoman . " " I 'll just say goodbye . " " All right . I wo n't make an issue over a few more minutes , " she said , though it was altogether clear how little she liked being crossed by a hysterical Jewish poet . " She has been carrying on in that swimsuit for a week now . She greets the mailman in it every morning . Now she is exhibiting herself in it for you . Given that less than two weeks ago she tried to take her life , I would hope that you could summon up as much self-control as our mailman does and ignore the rather transparent display of teenage vampirism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lived with Susan for over three years . " " I do n't wish to hear about that . I was never delighted by that arrangement . I deplored it , in fact . " " I was only explaining to you why I 'd prefer not to leave without at least telling her that I 'm going . " She said , " It is not possible for you to leave because she is lying on her back with her legs spread apart and  --  "  | " And , " I replied , my face ablaze , " suppose that were the reason ? " " Is that all you people can think about ? " " Which people ' are you referring to ? " " People like yourself and my daughter , experimenting with one another 's genitals , up there in New York . When do you stop being adolescent transgressors and grow up ? You know you never had the slightest intention of making Susan your wife . You are too much of a swinger ' for that . Such people used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in marriage , with its risks and its trials and its difficulties  --  only in sex , till it bores them . Well , that is your business  --  and your prerogative , I am sure , as an artist . But you should not be so reckless as to foist your elitist values upon someone like Susan , who happens to come from a different backgroundand was raised according to more traditional standards of conduct . Look at her out there , trying so hard to be a sexpot for your benefit . How could you have wanted to put such a ridiculous idea in that girl 's head ? Of all the things to encourage a person like Susan to become ! Why on earth could n't you have left such an unlikely candidate alone ? Must she be driven crazy with sex too ? Must every last woman in the world be turned on ' by you modern Don Juans ? To what end , Mr. Tarnopol , other than to quench your unquenchable sexual vanity ? Was n't she confused and broken enough  --  without this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you that you 're wrong . " I walked out into the garden and looked down at a body as I am iliar to me as my own . " I 'm going now , " I said . She opened her eyes against the sun , and she laughed , a small , rather surprisingly cynical laugh ; then after a moment 's contemplation , she raised the hand nearest to me from where it dangled to tin ground and placed it between the legs of my trousers , directly on my penis . And she held me like that , her face now stolid and being held . From where she had stepped out onto the patio , Mrs. Seabury looked on.  |p150This  all could n't have lasted as long as a minute . She lowered her hand to her own bare stomach . " Go ahead , " Susan whispered . " Go . " But just before I moved away she raised her body and pressed her cheek to my trousers . " And I was wrong , ' " said Mrs. Seabury , her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room to the street . At the time we met , Susan was just thirty and had been living for eleven years in the co-op apartment at Park and Seventy-ninth that had become hers ( along with the eighteenth-century English marquetry furniture , the heavy velvet draperies , the Aubusson carpets , and two million dollars ' worth of securities in McCall and McGee Industries ) when the company plane bearing her young husband to a board meeting crashed into a mountainside in upstate New York eleven months into the marriage . In that marrying the young heir had been considered by everyone ( excepting her father , who , characteristically , had remained silent ) a fantastic stroke of luck for a girl who had n't enough on the ball to survive two semesters at college , Susan ( who eventually confided to me that she really had n't liked McCall that much ) took his death very hard . Believingthat her chances were all used up at twenty , she retired to her bed and lay there , mute and motionless , every single day during the month of mourning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months at a fashionable " health farm " down in Bucks County known as the Institute for Better Living . Her father would have preferred that she return to the house on Mercer Street after she had completed her convalescence , but Susan 's " counselor " at the Institute had long talks with her about maturity and by the end of her stay had convinced her to return to the apartment at Park and Seventy-ninth and " give it a try on her own . " To be sure , she too would have preferred to return to Princeton and the father she adored  --  doing " research " for him in the library , lunching with him at Lahiere 's , hiking withp151him on weekends along the canal  --  if only living with her father did n't entail living under the gaze of her mother , that gaze that frightened her largely because it said , " You must grow up and you must go away . " In Manhattan , the rich and busy ladies in her building who " adopted " her made it their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the week , and on Saturdays , Sundays , and holidays accompanying schoolchildren around town to be sure they did n't lose their mufflers and were home in time for supper ( to which Susan , having sung her servile little lungs out for it , would sometimes be invited ) . That was what she did for eleven years  --  and , of course , she " fixed up " the apartment that she and this ghost named " Jamey " had never really " finished . " Every few years she enrolled in a course at the night division at Columbia . Always she would take copious notes and diligently do all the reading , until such time as she began to fear that the professorwas going to call upon her to speak . She would disappear then from the class , for a time , however , keeping up with the reading at home  --  even giving herself tests of her own devising . Men made some use of her over these eleven years , mostly after charity dinners and dances , which she attended on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chairwoman , a rising something or other in the world . That was easy enough , and after a while did not even require eight hundred milligrams of Miltown for her to be able to " cope " : she just opened her legs a little way , and he who was rising in the world did what little remained to be done . Sometimes the cousins and nephews ( or maybe it was just the thoughtful chairwomen ) sent her flowers the next day : she saved the cards in a folder in the file cabinet that contained her lecture notes and self-administered , ungraded examinations . " Will call . Great night . Love , A. " or B. or C.Early each summer there would generally be a knock on her apartment door : . a man to ask if she would have dinner with him while his wife was away in the country . These were the husbandsp152of the women in the building for whom she went around town all day picking up swatches of fabrics and straightening out errors in charge accounts . Their wives had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they would themselves have caught sight of the five foot nine inch redhead when she was getting in and out of taxis in front of the building , her arms loaded with other people 's Bergdorf boxes and her dress shimmying up her slender legs . One of these men , a handsome and charming investmentbanker ( " like a father to me , " the thirty-year-old widow told me , without blinking an eye ) , gave her a new electric range for a present when fall came and he wanted to be sure she kept her mouth shut ; she did n't need a new range ( not even to keep her mouth shut ) , but because she did not want to hurt his feelings , she had the one she and Jamey and the decorator had bought ripped out and the new one installed . And not one of these hot-weather paramours of hers , afflicted as he might be with middle-age wifeweariness , ever wanted to run off with the rich and beautiful young woman and start a new life  --  and that to Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case against her self-esteem . I did n't want to run off with her either . Yet I came back , night after night , returned to her apartment to eat and read and sleep , which was not what young A. , B. , C. , D. , or E. had ever done . And for good reason : they obviously had too much going for them , too much confidence and vitality and hope for the future , to settle for more than a night with the likes of Susan the Submissive . I , on the other hand , at the age of thirty , with my prizes and my publication behind me , had had it . I sat at dinner in Jamey 's baronial chair , Susan serving me like a geisha . I shaved in Jamey 's lacquered brothel of a bathroom , my towels warming on the electrical heating stand while I discovered the luxury of his Rolls razor . I read in his gargantuan club chair , my feet up on the ottoman covered in Jamey 's mother 's favorite flame stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday . I drank those rare vintages of Jamey 's wine that Susan had kept at the proper temperature in an **25;1466;TOOLONG all these years , as though she expected that he might rise from the grave one day and ask to taste his Richebourg . When my shoes got wet in a rainstorm , I stuffed them with his wooden shoe trees and padded around in his velvet slippers from Tripler 's . I borrowed stays from his shirts . I weighed myself on his scale . And was generally bored by his wife . But she did not make a single demand . All Susan said to me about our arrangement was this , and being Susan , she did n't even say it aloud : " I 'm yours . I 'll do anything . Come and go as you like . Let me feed you . Let me sit with you at night and watch you read . You can do anything you want to my body . I 'll do anything you say . Just have dinner with me sometimes and use some of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be good as gold . I wo n't ask what you do when you go away . You do n't have to take me anywhere . Just stay here sometimes and make use of whatever you want , including me . You see , I have all these thick bath-sized towels and Belgian lace tablecloths , all this lovely crockery , three bathrooms , two televisions , and two million dollars of Jamey 's money with more of my own to come , I have these breasts and this vagina , these limbs , this skin  --  and no life . Give me just a little bit of that , and in return whenever you want to you can come here and recover from your wife . Any hour of the day or night . You do n't even have to call beforehand . " It 's a deal , I said . The broken shall succor the broken . Of course , Susan was not the first young woman that I had met in New York since I 'd come East seeking asylum in June of ' 62 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . According to the custom of that era  --  it is depressing to think that it may be the custom still  --  I had been to parties , befriended girls ( which is to say , stood exchangingironic quips with them in the corner of someone 's crowded West Side apartment ) , and then had gone to bed with them , either before or after taking them out to dinner a couple of times . Some were undoubtedly nice people , but I did n't have the staying power or the confidence really to find out . Oftentimes dur/ing my first year in New York I discovered that I did not really want to take off my clothes or those of my new-found acquaintance , once we had gotten back to one or another of our apartments , and so I would fall into silent fits of melancholy that must have made me seem rather freakish  --  or at least affected . One young knockout , I remember , took it very personally and became incensed that I should suddenly have turned lugubrious on her after having been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of those crowded living rooms ; she asked if it was true that I was trying to kick being queer , and I , dim-witted as can be , began to struggle to remove her pantyhose , an act which turned out to consume such passion as I had . She took her leave shortly thereafter , and the following morning , going down for the paper and my seeded roll , I found wedged into the frame of the door an index card that had penciled on it , " Abandon Hope , All Ye Who Enter Here . " Those parties I went to , with their ongoing intersexual competition in self-defense , bred a lot of this sort of scuffling , or maybe a little bit went a long way with me then ; eventually invitationsfrom editors and writers to parties where there would be " a lot of girls " I mostly turned down ; when I did n't , I generally regrettedit afterward . Only months after my arrival , it became clear to me  --  depressinglyso  --  that New York City was probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man in my predicament to try to put an end to his old life and begin a new one . As I was discoveringat these parties , I was in no shape to get much pleasure out of my status as a " single " man ; and , as I discovered in my lawyer 's office , the state of New York was hardly about to grant that status de lure recognition . Indeed , now that the Peter Tarnopols were New York residents , it looked as though they would be husband and wife forever . Too late I learned that had we gotten separated back in Wisconsin , we could , according to the law there , have been divorced after having voluntarily lived separate and apart for five years . ( Of course , had I returned to Wisconsin in June of ' 62 ,  |p155rather  than staying on at Morris 's apartment and from there launchinginto my career as Spielvogel 's patient , it is doubtful that I ever could have managed to set myself up in Madison separate and apart from Maureen . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had taken New York to be , the only grounds for divorce was adultery , and since Maureen did not want to divorce me on any grounds , and I had no way of knowing whether she was an adulteress , or proving it even if I knew , it looked in all likelihood as though I would be celebrating my golden wedding anniversary on the steps of the State House in Albany . Moreover , because my lawyer had been unable to get Maureen and her attorney to agree to a legal separation or to any kind of financial settlement ( let alone to a Mexican or Nevada divorce that would have required mutual consent to be incontestable ) , my official marital status in New York very shortly came to be that of the guilty party in a separation action brought by a wife against a husband who had " abandoned " her . Though we had lived together as husband and wife for only three years , I was ordered by the New York court to provide maintenance for my abandoned wife to the tune of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until death did us part . And in New York State what else could part us ? I could , of course , have moved and taken up residence in some state with a less restrictive divorce law , and for a while , with the aid of The Complete Guide to Divorce by Samuel G. Kling  --  the hook that became my bedside Bible in that first bewildering phase of my life as a New York resident  --  I seriously investigated the possibilities . Reading Kling I found out that in some eleven states " separation without cohabitation and without reasonable expectationn of reconciliation " was grounds for divorce , after anywhere Iruni eighteen months to three years . One night I got out of bed at four A.M. and sat down and wrote letters to the state universities in each of the eleven states and asked if there might be a job open for me in their department of English ; within the month I had reeeivecloffers from the universities of Florida , Delaware , andp156Wyoming . According to Kling , in the first two states " voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only two years ' separation was necessary . My lawyer was quick to advise me of the various means by which Maureen might attempt to contest such a divorce ; he also let me know that upon granting me a divorce the out-of-state judge would in all probability order me to continue to pay the alimony set by the New York court in the separation judgment ; furthermore ( to answer my next question ) , if I refused after the divorce to make the alimony payments , I could be ( and with Maureen as my antagonist , no doubt would be ) hauled into court under state reciprocity agreements and held in contempt by the Florida or Delaware or Wyoming judge for failing to support my former spouse in New York . A divorce , my lawyer said , I might be able to pull off  --  but escape the alimony ? never . Nonetheless , I went ahead and accepted a job teaching American literature and creative writing the following September in Laramie , Wyoming . I went immediately to the library and took out books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Natural History and walked among the Indian artifacts and the tableau of the American bison . I decided I would try to learn to ride a horse , at least a little , before I got out there . And I thought of the money I would not be paying to Dr. Spielvogel . Some ten weeks later I wrote to tell the chairman of the English department in Laramie that because of unforeseen circumstances I would be unable to take the job . The unforeseen circumstance was the hopelessness I had begun to feel at the prospect of a twoyearexile in Wyoming . After which I might be able to ride a horse , but I would still have to pay through the nose . If the divorce even went uncontested ! And would Florida be any better ? Less remote , but a year longer to qualify for the divorce , and the end result just as uncertain . It was about this time that I decided that the only way out was to leave America and its marital laws and reciprocal state agreements and begin my life anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood that Maureen could always attachp157future royalties if they were to come through a New York publishinghouse , I would have to sell world rights to my next book to my English publisher and receive all payment through him . Or why not start from scratch  --  grow a beard and change my name ? .. . And who was to say there would ever be a next book ? I spent the following few months deciding whether to return to Italy , where I still had a few friends , or to try Norway , where chances were slim that anybody would ever find me ( unless of course they went looking ) . How about Finland ? I read all about Finland in the Encyclopaedia Britannica . High rate of literacy , long winters , and many trees . I imagined myself in Helsinki , and , while I was at it , Istanbul , Marrakesh , Lisbon , Aberdeen , and the Shetland Islands . Very good place to disappear , the Shetland Islands . Pop . 19,343 , and not that far , really , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also raise famous ponies . No mention in Britannica of treaty agreement with New York State for extradition of marital criminals . . . But , oh , if I was outraged in New York over all I had lost in that marriage , imagine how I would feel when I woke up bearded in my cottage on the moors in Scalloway to discover I had lost my country as well . What " freedom " would I have won then , speaking American to the ponies ? What " justice " would I have made , an ironical Jewish novelist with a crook and a pack of sheep ? And what 's worse , suppose she found me out and followed me there , for all that my name is now Long Tom Dumphy ? Not at all unlikely , given that I could n't shake her in this , a country of two hundred million . Oh , imagine what that would be like , me with me stick and Maureen with her rage in the middle of the roarin ' North Sea , and " lily 19,343 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not at all , really ) I accepted my fate as a male resident of the state of New York of the republic of America who no longer cared to live with a wife whose preference it was to continue to live with ( and off ) him . I began , as they say , to try to make the best of it . Indeed , by the time I met Susan I wasp158actually beginning to pass out of the first stages of shell shock ( or was it fallout sickness ? ) and had even found myself rather taken with ( as opposed to " taken by , " very much a preoccupation at the time ) a bright and engaging girl named Nancy Miles , fresh out of college and working as a " checker " for the New Yorker . Nancy Miles was eventually to go off to Paris to marry an American journalist stationed there , and subsequently to publish a book of autobiographical short stories , most of them based upon her childhoodas a U.S. Navy commander 's daughter in postwar Japan . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird , and soaring like one , too . I had n't been so drawn to anyone since the Wisconsin debacle , when I had thrown myself at the feet of my nineteenyear-oldstudent Karen ( for whom I intermittently continued to pine , by the way ; I imagined her sometimes with me and the sheep in Scalloway ) , but after three consecutive evenings together of nonstop dinner conversation , the last culminating in lovemaking as impassioned as anything I 'd known since those illicit trysts between classes in Karen 's room , I decided not to call Nancy again . Two weeks passed , and she sent me this letter : Mr. Peter TarnopolInstitute for Unpredictable Behavior62 West 12th Street New York , N.Y.Dear Mr. Tarnopol : With reference to our meeting of 5/6/63 : 1 . What happened ? 2 . Where are we ? While I fully recognize that numerous demands of this nature must strain the limits of your patience , I nonetheless make bold to request that you fill out the above questionnaire and return it to the address below as soon as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not broken . That was the last I heard from Nancy . I chose Susan . It goes without saying that those seeking sanctuary have ordinarily to settle for something less than a seven-room apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in which to take refuge from the wolves or the cops or the cold . I for one had never lived in anything approaching Susan 's place for size or grandeur . Nor had I ever eaten so well in my life . Maureen 's cooking was n't that bad , but generally dinnertime was the hour reserved at our house for settling scores with me and my sex  --  unsettled scores that some evenings seemed to me to have been piling up ever since the first nucleic acid molecule went ahead and reproduced itself several billion years ago ; consequently , even when the food was hot and tasty , the ambience was wrong . And in the years before I took to dining in each night on Maureen 's gall , there had been army chow or universitycafeteria stew . But Susan was a pro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Calpurnia 's knee : during the year she had been waiting for her fiance to be graduated from Princetonand their life of beauty and abundance to begin , she had commutedup to New York to learn how to cook French , Italian , and Chinese specialties . The course in each cuisine lasted six weeks , and Susan stayed on ( as she had n't at Wellesley ) triumphantly to complete all three . To her great glee she discovered she could now at least outcook her mother . Oh , what a wonderful wife ( she hoped and prayed ) she was going to make for this fantastic stroke of luck named James McCall the Third ! During her widowhood Susan had only rarely had the oppor-t may city to feed anyone other than herself , and so it was that I became the first dinner guest ever to appreciate in full a culinary expertise that spanned the continents . I had never tasted food so delicious . And not even my own dutiful mother had waited on me the way this upper-crust waitress did . I was under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could scamper freely back and forth into the kitchen getting the next dish going in her wok . Good enough . We had little outside of the food to talk about anyway . I asked about her family , I asked about her analysis , I asked about Jamey and the McCalls . I asked why she had left Wellesley in her first year . She shrugged and she flushed and she averted her eyes . She replied , oh they 're very nice , and he 's very nice , and she 's such a sweet and thoughtful person , and " Why did I leave Wellesley ? Oh , I just left . " For weeks I got no more information or animationthan I had the night we met , when I was seated next to her at the dinner party I was invited to annually at my publisher 's town house : unswerving agreeableness , boundless timidity  --  a frail and terrified beauty . And in the beginning that was just fine with me . Bring on the blanquette de veau . Each morning I headed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to school to practice the three Rs  --  reading , writing , and angrily toting up yet again the alimony and legal bills . In the elevator , as I descended from 9D , I met up with the schoolchildrena third my age whom Susan took on weekends to the Planetarium and the puppet shows , and the successful business executives whose August recreation she had sometimes been . And what am I doing here , I would ask myself . With her ! Just how debilitated can I be ! My brother 's recent warning would frequently come back to me as I exited past the doorman , who always courteouslyraised his cap to Mrs. McCall 's gentleman caller , but had surmised enough about my bankroll not to make a move to hail a cab . Moe had telephoned me about Susan the night after I had come around with her to have dinner at his and Lenore 's invitation . He laid it right on the line . " Another Maureen , Pep ? " " She 's hardly a Maureen . " " The gray eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiddo . Another fucked-up shiksa . First the lumpenproletariat , now the aristocracy . What are you , the Malinowski of Manhattan ? Enough erotic anthropology . Get rid of her , Pep . You 're sticking your plug in the same socket . " " Moe , hold the advice ,  |p161okay  ? " " Not this time . I do n't care to come home a year from now , Peppy , to find you shitting into your socks . " " But I 'm all right . " " Oh , Christ , here we go again . " " Moey , I happen to know what I 'm doing . " " With a woman you know what you 're doing ? Look , what the hell is Spielvogel 's attitude toward this budding catastrophe  --  what is he doing to earn his twenty bucks an hour , anything ? " " Moe , she is not Maureen ! " " You 're letting the legs fool you , kid , the legs and the ass . " " I tell you I 'm not in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Her deep intelligence ? Her quick wit ? You mean on top of being tongue-tied , the ice cube ca n't screw right either ? Jesus ! A pretty face must go an awful long way with you  --  that , plus a good strong dose of psychoneurosis , and a girl is in business with my little brother . You come over here tonight for dinner , Peppy , you come eat with us every night  --  I 've got to talk some sense into you . " But each evening I turned up at Susan 's , not Moe 's , carrying with me my book to be read later by the fire , envisioning , as I stepped through the door , my blanquette , my bath , and my bed . So the first months passed . Then one night I said , " Why do n't you go back to college ? " " Oh , I could n't do that . " " Why could n't you ? " " I have too much to do already . " " You have nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you go back to college , Susan ? " " I 'm too busy , really . Did you say you did want kirsch on your fruit ? " Some weeks later . " Look , a suggestion . " " Yes ? " " Why do n't you move in bed ? " " Have n't you enough room ? " " I mean move . Underneathme . " " Oh , that . I just do n't , that 's all . " " Well , try it . It might liven things up . " " I 'm happy as I am , thank you . Do n't you like the spinach salad ? " " Listen to me : why do n't you move your body when I fuck you , Susan ? " " Oh , please , let 's just finish dinner . " " I want you to move when I fuck you . " " I told you , I 'm happy as I am . " " You 're miserable as you are . " " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you know how to move ? " " Oh , why are you torturingme like this ? " " Do you want me to show you what I mean by ' move ' ? " " Stop this . I am not going to talk about it ! I do n't have top162be shown anything , certainly not by you ! Your life is n't such a model of order , you know . " " What about college ? Why do n't you go back to college ? " " Peter , stop . Please ! Why are you doing this to me ? " " Because the way you live is awful . " " It is not . " " It 's crazy , really . " " If it 's so crazy then what are you doing here every night ? I do n't force you to spend the night . I do n't ask anything of you at all . " " You do n't ask anything of anyone , so that 's neither here nor there . " " That 's none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why ? Why yours ? " " Because I am here  --  because I do spend the night . " " Oh , please , you must stop right now . Do n't make me argue , please . I hate arguments and I refuse to participate in one . If you want to argue with somebody , go argue with your wife . I thought you come here not to fight . " She had a point , the point  --  here I need contend with nothing  --  but it stopped me only for a while . Eventually one night some two months later she jumped up from the table and , popping her one tear , said , " I ca n't go back to school , and leave me alone about it  --  I 'm too old and I 'm too stupid ! What school would even take me ! " It turned out to be C.C.N.Y. They gave her credit for one semester'swork at Wellesley . " This is just too silly . I 'm practically thirtyone . People will laugh . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not going to do it . By the time I graduated I 'd be fifty . " " What are you going to do instead till you 're fifty , shop ? " " I help my friends . " " Those friends can hire fellows pulling rickshaws to help them the way you do . " " That 's just being cynical about people you do n't like . I have a huge apartment to take care of , besides . " " What are you so frightened of ? " " That 's not the issue . " " What is then ? " " That you wo n't just let me do things the way I want to . Everything I do is wrong in your eyes . You 're just like my mother . She never thinks I can do anything right either . " " Well , I think you can . " " Only because you 're embarrassed by my stupidity .

" " Oh , Peter , " she moaned , and clinging to her napkin crawled into my lap to be rocked like a child  --  " what if I have to talk in class ? What if they call on me ? " Through my shirt I could feel ice packs on my back  --  her two hands . " What do I do then ? " she pleaded . " Speak . " " But if I ca n't . Oh , why are you putting me through this misery ?

I 'm so terrified I feel faint . " Though not too terrified to utter aloud , for the first time in her life , that most dangerous of American words . The next afternoon I had one of those mock headlines printed up in a Times Square amusement palace and presented it to her at dinner , a phony tabloid with a black three-inch banner reading : SUSAN SAYS IT ! In the kitchen one night a year later I sat on a stool near the stove sipping a glass of the last of Jamey 's Mouton-Rothschild , while Susan prepared ratatouille and practiced a talk she had to give the next morning in her introductory philosophy class , a fiveminutediscourse on the Skeptics . " I ca n't remember what comes next  --  I ca n't do it . " " Concentrate . " " But I 'm cooking something . " " It will cook itself . " " Nothing cooks itself that tastes any good . " " ' Then stop a minute and let 's hear what you 're going to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skeptics . And you do n't , Peter . And nobody in my class cares , I can assure you of that . And what if I just ca n't talk ? What if I open my mouth and nothing comes out ? That 's what happened to me at Wellesley . " And to me at Brooklyn College , but I did n't tell her , not on that occasion . " Something , " I said confidently , " will come out . " " Yes ? What ? " " Words . Concentrate on the words the way you concentrate on the eggplant there  --  " " Woccld you come with me ? On the subway ? Just till I get up there ? " " I 'll even come to the class with you . " " No ! You must n't ! I 'd he paralyzed if you were there . " " But I 'm here . " " This is a kitchen , "  |p164she  said , smiling , but not all that happy . And then , with some furtherprodding , she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ratatouille than to me . " Perfect . " " Yes ? " " Yes . " " Then why , " asked Susan , who was turning out to be a wittier young widow than any of us had imagined , " then why do I have to do it again tomorrow ? Why ca n't this count ? " " Because it 's a kitchen . " " Shit , " said Susan , " that 's not fair . " Am I describing two people falling in love ? If so , I did n't recognize it for that at the time . Even after a year , Susan 's still seemed to me my hideout , my sanctuary from Maureen , her lawyer , and the courts of the state of New York , all of whom had designated me a defendant . But at Susan 's I needed no more defense than a king upon his throne . Where else could I go to be so revered ? The answer , friends , is nowhere ; it had been a long time between salaams . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to live right . Admittedly , A Lot I Knew , but then it did not take much to know that it is better to be a full-time student at City College than a matriculated customer at Bergdorf 's and Bonwit 's from nine to five , and better , I believed , to be alive and panting during the sex act than in a state of petrifaction , if you are going to bother to perform that act at all . So I , ironically enough , coached my student in remedial copulation and public speaking , and she nursed me with the tenderest tenderness and the sweetest regard . A new experience all around . So was the falling in love , if that 's what our mutual education and convalescence added up to . When she made the dean 's list I was as proud as any papa , bought her a bracelet and dinner ; and when she tried and failed to come , I was crushed and disbelieving , like a high-school teacher whose brilliant , impoverishedstudent has somehow been turned down for the scholarship to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study sessions we had put in together ? All that dedication and hard work ! Where had we gone wrong ? I have suggested how unnerving it was for me to be accomplice to that defeat  --  the fact is that somewhere along the way Susan 's effort to reach an orgasm came to stand in myp165mind for the full recovery of us both . And maybe this , as much as anything , helped to make it unattainable , the responsibility for my salvation as well as her own being far too burdensome for her to bear . . . You see , I am not claiming here that I went about conductingthis affair in the manner of a reclamation engineer  --  nor was I seeking to unseat Dr. Golding , who was paid to cure the sick and heal the wounded , and whose own theory , as it sifted through to me , seemed to be that the more paternal or patriarchal my influenceupon Susan , the more remote the prospect of the orgasm . I thought one could make as good an argument against this line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was neither theoretician nor diagnostician , nor for that matter much of a " father figure " in my own estimation . It would have seemed to me that you had n't to penetrate very far beneath the surface of our affair to see that I ' was just another patient looking for the cure himself . In fact , it required my doctor to get me to continue to take my medicine named Susan , when , along the way , I repeatedly complainedthat I 'd had enough , that the medicine was exacerbating the ailment more than it might be curing it . Dr. Spielvogel did not take my brother Moe 's view of Susan  --  no , with Spielvogel I did . " She 's hopeless , " I would tell him , " a frightened little sparrow . " " You would prefer another vulture ? " " Surely there must be something in between , " thinking , as I spoke , of Nancy Miles , that soaringcreature , and the letter I 'd never answered . " But you do n't have something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that timidity , all that fear . . . The woman is a slave , Doctor , and not just to meto everyone . " " You prefer contentiousness ? You miss the scenes of high drama , do you ? With Maureen , so you told me , it was the Gotterdammerung at breakfast , lunch , and dinner . What 's wrong with a little peace and quiet with your meals ? " " But there are times when she is a mouse . " " Good enough , " said Spielvogel , " who ever heard of a little mouse doing a grown man any serious harm ? " " But what happens when the mouse wants to be married  --  and to me ? " " How can she marry you ? You are married already . " " But whenp166I 'm no Ionger married . " " There will be time to worry about that then , do n't you think ? " " No . I do n't think that at all . What if when I should want to leave her , she tries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor , she is not strong  --  you must understand that . " " Which are you talking about now , Maureen or Susan ? " " I can tell them apart , I assure you . But that does n't mean that it is n't beyond Susan , just because it happens also to be a specialty of Maureen 's . " " Has she threatened you with suicide if you should ever leave her ? " " She would n't threaten me with anything . That is n't her way . " " But you are certain that she would do it , if at some future date , when the issue arose , you chose not to marry her . That is the reason you want to give her up now . " " I do n't particularly want ' to . I 'm telling you I ought to . " " But you are enjoying yourself somewhat , am I right ? " " Somewhat , yes . More than somewhat . But I do n't want to lead her on . She is not up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading her on , to have an affair , two young people ? " " Not in your eyes , perhaps . " " In whose then ? Your own ? " " In Susan 's , Doctor , in Susan 's ! Look , what if after the affair is no more , she can not accept the fact and commits suicide ? Answer that , will you ? " " Over the loss of you she commits suicide ? " " Yes ! " " You think every woman in the world is going to kill herself over you ? " " Oh , please , do n't distort the point I 'm making . Not every woman '  --  just the two I 've wound up with . " " Is this why you wind up with them ? " " Is it ? I 'll think about it . Maybe so . But then that is yet another reason to dissolve this affair right now . Why continue if there is anything like a chance of that coming to pass ? Why would you want to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was I encouraging that ' ? I was only encouraging you to find some pleasure and comfort in her compliant nature . I tell you , many a man would envy you . Not everybody would be so distressed as you by a mistress who is beautifuland submissive and rich , and a Cordon Bleu cook into the bargain . " " And , conceivably , a suicide . " " That remains to be seen . Many things are conceivable that have little basis in reality . " " I 'm afraid in my position I ca n't afford to be so cavalier about it . " " Notp167cavalier . Only no more convinced than is warranted , in the circumstances . And no more terrified . " " Look , I am not up to any more desperate stunts . I 've got a right to be terrified . I was married to Maureen . I still am ! " " Well then , if you feel so strongly , if you 've been burned once and do n't want to take the chance  --  " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a chance '  --  and I do n't feel I have a right to take it . It 's her life that is endangered , not mine . " " ' Endangered ' ? What a narcissistic melodrama you are writing here , Mr. Tarnopol . If I may offer a literary opinion . " " Yes ? Is that what it is ? " " Is n't it ? " " I do n't always know , Doctor , exactly what you mean by narcissism . ' What I think I am talking about is responsibility . You are the one who is talking about the pleasure and comforts in staying . You are the one who is talking about what is in it for me . You are the one who is telling me not to worry about Susan 's expectations or vulnerability . It would seem to me that it 's you who are inviting me to take the narcissistic line . " " All right , if that 's what you think , then leave her before it goes any further . You have this sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But just a second ago you were suggesting that my sense of responsibility was misplaced . That my fears were delusional . Or were n't you ? " " I think they are excessive , yes . " Fight now I get no advice about Susan from anyone . I am here to be free of advisers  --  and temptation . Susan a temptation ? Susan a temptress ? What a word to describe her ! Yet I have never ached for anyone like this before . As the saying goes , we 'd been through a lot together , and not in the way that Maureen and I had been " through it . " With Maureen it was the relentless sameness of the struggle that nearly drove me mad ; no matter how much reason or intelligence or even brute force I tried to bring to bear upon our predicament , I could not change a thing  --  everything I did was f tile , including of course doing nothing . With Susan there was struggle all right , but then there were rewards . Things changed. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and touching transformations all around . Surely the last thing you could say was that ours was a comfortable , settled arrangement that came to an end because our pleasures had become tiresome and stale . No , the progress was the pleasure , the transformations what gave me most delight  --  which is what has made her attempt at suicide so crushing . . . what makes my yearning for her all the more bewildering . Because now it looks as though nothing has changed , and we are back where we began . I have to wonder if the letters I begin to write to her and leave unfinished , if the phone calls I break off dialing before the last digit , if that is n't me beginning to give way to the siren song of The Woman Who Can not Live Without You , She Who Would Rather Be Dead Than Unwed  --  if this is n't me on the brink again of making My Mistake , contriving to continue , after a brief intermission , what Spielvogel would call my narcissistic melodrama . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that out of fear of My Mistake , I am making another even worse : relinquishing for no good reason the generous , gentle , good-hearted , un-Maureenish woman with whom I have actually come to be in love . I think to myself , " Take this yearning seriously . You want her , " and I rush to the phone to call down to Princeton  --  and then at the phone I ask myself if " love " has very much to do with it , if it is n't the vulnerability and brokenness , the neediness , to which I am being drawn . Suppose it is really nothing more than a helpless beauty in a bikini bathing suit taking hold of my cock as though it were a lifeline , suppose it is only that that inspires this longing . Such things have been known to happen . " Sexual vanity , " as Mrs. Seabury says . " Rescue fantasies , " says Dr. Spielvogel , " boyish dreams of Oedipal glory .

MARRIAGE A LA MODERapunzel , Rapunzel , Let down your hair.  --  from the Grimms ' fairy taleFor those young men who reached their maturity in the fifties , and who aspired to be grown-up during that decade , when as one participant has written , everyone wanted to be thirty , there was considerable moral prestige in taking a wife , and hardly because a wife was going to be one 's maidservant or " sexual object . " Decency and Maturity , a young man 's " seriousness , " were at issue precisely because it was thought to be the other way around : in that the great world was so obviously a man 's , it was only within marriage that an ordinary woman could hope to find equality and dignity . Indeed , we were led to believe by the defenders of womankindof our era that we were exploiting and degrading the women we did n't marry , rather than the ones we did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even able to go to the movies or out to a restaurant by herself , let alone perform an appendectomy or drive a truck . It was up to us then to give them the value and the purpose that society at large withheld  --  by marryingthem . If we did n't marry women , who would ? Ours , alas , was the only sex available for the job : the draft was on . No wonder then that a young college-educated bourgeois male of my generation who scoffed at the idea of marriage for himself , who would just as soon eat out of cans or in cafeterias , sweep his own floor , make his own bed , and come and go with no binding legal attachments , finding female friendship and sexual adventure where and when he could and for no longer than he liked , laid himself open to the charge of " immaturity , " if not " latent " or blatant " homo/sexuality . " Or he was just plain " selfish . " Or he was " frightened of responsibility . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional phrase , that ) to " a permanent relationship . " Worst of all , most shameful of all , the chances were that this person who thought he was perfectly able to take care of himself on his own was in actuality " unable to love . " An awful lot of worrying was done in the fifties about whether people were able to love or not  --  I venture to say , much of it by young women in behalf of the young men who did n't particularly want them to wash their socks and cook their meals and bear their children and then tend them for the rest of their natural days . " But are n't you capable of loving anyone ? Ca n't you think of anyonebut yourself ? " when translated from desperate fifties-feminese into plain English , generally meant " I want to get married and I want you to get married to . " Now I am sure that many of the young women of that period who set themselves up as specialists in loving had n't a very clear idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for survival  --  or how much those emotions arose out of the yearning to own and be owned , rather than from a reservoir of pure and selflesslove that was the special property of themselves and their gender . After all , how lovable are men ? Particularly men " unable to love " ? No , there was more to all that talk about " commitment " and " permanent relationships " than many young women ( and their chosen mates ) were able to talk about or able at that time fully to understand : the more was the fact of female dependence , defenselessness , and vulnerability . This hard fact of life was of course experienced and dealt with by women in accordance with personal endowments of intelligence and sanity and character . One imagines that there were brave and genuinely self-sacrificing decisions made by women who refused to accede to those profoundest of self-delusions , the ones that come cloaked in the guise of love ; likewise , there was much misery in store for those who were never able to surrender their romanticp171illusions about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they reached the lawyer 's office , and he threw their way that buoy known as alimony . It has been said that those ferocious alimony battles that have raged in the courtrooms of this country during the last few decades , the way religious wars raged throughout Europe in the seventeenth century , were really " symbolic " in nature . My guess is that rather than serving as a symbol around which to organize other grievances and heartaches , the alimony battle frequently tended to clarify what was generally obscured by the metaphors with which marital arrangements were camouflaged by the partners themselves . The extent of the panic and rage aroused by the issue of alimony , the ferocity displayed by people who were otherwise sane and civilized enough , testifies , I think , to the shocking  --  and humiliating  --  realization that came to couples in the courtroom about the fundamental role that each may actually have played in the other 's life . " So , it has descended to this , " the enraged contestants might say , glaring in hatred at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to hide from the most humiliating fact of all : that it really was this , all along . Now I realize that it is possible to dismiss these generalizations as a manifestation of my bitterness and cynicism , an unfortunate consequence of my own horrific marriage and of the affair that recentlyended so unhappily . Furthermore , it can be said that , having chosen women like Maureen and Susan ( or , if you prefer , having had them chosen for me by my own aberrant , if not pathological , nature ) , I for one should not generalize , even loosely , about what men want ( and get ) from women , or what women want and get out of men . Well , I grant that I do not find myself feelingvery " typical " at this moment , nor am I telling this story in order to argue that my life is representative of anything ; nonetheless , I am naturally interested in looking around to see how much of my experience with women has been special to me and  --  if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much isp172symptomatic of a more extensive social malaise . And looking around , I conclude this : in Maureen and Susan I came in contact with two of the more virulent strains of a virus to which only a few women among us are immune . Outwardly , of course , Maureen and Susan could n't have beenmore dissimilar , nor could either have had a stronger antipathy for the " type " she took the other to be . However , what drew them together as women  --  which is to say , what drew me to them , for that is the subject here  --  was that in her own extreme and vivid way , each of these antipathetic originals demonstrated that sense of defenselessnessand vulnerability that has come to be a mark of their sex and is often at the core of their relations with men . That I came to be bound to Maureen by my helplessness does not mean that either of us ever really stopped envisioning her as the helpless victim and myself as the victimizer who had only to desist in his brutishness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . So strong was the myth of male inviolability , of male dominance and potency , not only in Maureen 's mind but in mine , that even when I went so far as to dress myself in a woman 's clothes and thus concedethat as a man I surrendered , even then I could never fully assent to the idea that in our household conventional assumptions about the strong and the weak did not adequately describe the situation . Right down to the end , I still saw Maureen , and she saw herself , as the damsel in distress ; and in point of fact , beneath all that tough exterior , all those claims to being " in business for herself " and nobody 's patsy , Maureen was actually more of a Susan than Susan was , and to herself no less than to me . There is a growing body of opinion which maintains that by and large marriages , affairs , and sexual arrangements generally aremade by masters in search of slaves : there are the dominant and the submissive , the brutish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this formula fails to explain , among a million other things , is why so many of the " masters " appear themselves to be in  |p173the  point yet again  --  that my story furnishes anything like an explanation or a paradigm ; it is only an instance , a postchivalric instance to be sure , of what might be described as the Prince Charming phenomenon . In this version of the fairy tale the part of the maiden locked in the tower is played consecutively by Maureen Johnson Tarnopol and Susan Seabury McCall . I of course play the prince . My performance , as described here , may give rise to the sardonic suggestion that I should have played his horse . But , you see , it was not as an animal that I wished to be a star  --  it was decidedlynot horsiness , goatishness , foxiness , lionliness , or beastlinessin any form that I aspired to . I wanted to be humanish : manly , a man . At the time when all this began , I would never even have thought it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at twenty-five that success was all but at hand  --  nor did I foresee a career in which being married and then trying to get unmarried would become my predominant activity and obsession . I would have laughed had anyone suggested that struggling with a woman over a marriage would come to occupy me in the way that exploringthe South Pole had occupied Admiral Byrd  --  or writing Madame Bovary had occupied Flaubert . Clearly the last thing I could have imagined was myself , a dissident and skeptical member of my generation , succumbing to all that moralizing rhetoric about " permanentrelationships . " And , in truth , it did take something more than the rhetoric to do me in . It took a Maureen , wielding it . Yet the humbling fact remains : when the dissident and skeptical member of his generation was done in , it was on the same grounds as just about everyone else . I was fooled by appearances , largely my own . As a young writer already publishing stories in literary quarterlies , as one who resided in a Lower East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living on army savings and a twelve-hundred-dollar publisher 's advance that I doled outp174to myself at thirty dollars a week , I did not think of myself as an ordinary or conventional university graduate of those times . My college acquaintances were all off becoming lawyers and doctors ; a few who had been friends on the Brown literary magazine were working on advanced degrees in literature  --  prior to my induction into the army , I had myself served a year and a half in the Ph.D . program at the University of Chicago , before falling by the wayside , a casualty of " Bibliography " and " Anglo-Saxon " ; the rest  --  the fraternity boys , the athletes , the business majors , those with whom I 'd had little association at school  --  were by now already married and holding down nine-to-five jobs . Of course I dressed in blue button-down oxford shirts and wore my hair clipped short , but what else was I to wear , a serape ? long curls ? This was 1958 . Besides , there were other ways in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my contemporaries : I read books and I wanted to write them . My master was not Mammon or Fun or Propriety , but Art , and Art of the earnest moral variety . I was by then already well into writing a novel about a retired Jewish haberdasher from the Bronx who on a trip to Europe with his wife nearly strangles to death a rude German housewife in his rage over " the six million . " The haberdasher was modeled upon my own kindly , excitable , hardworkingJewish father who had had a similar urge on a trip he and my mother had taken to visit me in the army ; the haberdasher 's GI son was modeled upon myself , and his experiences closely paralleledmine in Germany during my fourteen months as a corporal in Frankfurt . I had had a German girl friend , a student nurse , large and blonde as a Valkyrie , but sweet to the core , and all the confusion that she had aroused in my parents , and in me , was to be at the heart of the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not have a photograph of a sailboat or a dream house or a diapered child or a travel poster from a distant land , but words from Flaubert , advice to a young writer that I had copied out of one of his letters : " Be regular and orderly in your life like a bourgeois , so that you may be violent and original in yourp175work . " I appreciated the wisdom in this , and coming from Flaubert , the wit , but at twenty-five , for all my dedication to the art of fiction , for all the discipline and seriousness ( and awe ) with which I approached the Flaubertian vocation , I still wanted my life to be somewhat original , and if not violent , at least interesting , when the day 's work was done . After all , had n't Flaubert himself , before he settled down at his round table to become the tormented anchorite of modern literature , gone off as a gentleman-vagabond to the Nile , to climb the pyramids and sow his oats with dusky dancing girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , struck me as someone who might add a little outside interest to my dedicated writer 's life . Did she ! Eventually she displaced the writing , she was so interesting . To begin with , she was twenty-nine years of age , that temptingly unknown creature of a young man 's eroto-heroic imaginings , an older woman . Moreover , she had the hash marks to prove it . Not one but two divorces : first from the husband in Rochester , a Yugoslav saloonkeeper named Mezik , whose sixteenyear-oldbarmaid she had been ; she claimed that Mezik , a heavy drinker with a strong right hook , had once " forced " her to go down on a friend of his , the manager of an upholstery factory  --  later she changed the story somewhat and said that the three of them had been drunk at the time , and that the men had drawn straws to see which of them young Maureen would go off with to the bedroom ; she had decided to blow Mezik 's buddy , rather than have intercoursewith him , because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence , less demeaning . " It was n't , " she added . Then the marriage and divorce from Walker , a handsome young actor with a resonant voice and a marvelous profile who turned out to be a homosexual  --  that is to say , he 'd " promised " Maureen he 'd get over it after the wedding , but only got worse . Twice then she had been " betrayed " by men  --  nonetheless there was plenty of the scrapper in her when we met . And plenty of tough wit . " I am Duchess of Mafi still , " was a line she pulled on me our first night in bed  --  not bad , I thought , not bad , even if it wasp176obviously something her actor husband had taught her . She had the kind of crisp good looks that are associated with " dark Irishmen "  --  onlya little marred in her case by a lantern jaw  --  a lithe , wiry little body ( the body of a tomboyish prepubescent , except for the sizable conical breasts ) and terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , she was like one of nature 's undersizedindefatigables , the bee or the hummingbird , who are out workingthe flowers from sunup to sundown , sipping from a million stamensin order to meet their minimum daily nutritional requirements . She jocularly boasted of having been the fastest runner , male or female , of her era in the Elmira , New York , grade-school system , and that ( of all she told me ) may well have been the truth . The night we met  --  at a poet 's party uptown  --  she had challenged me to a footrace from the Astor Place subway station to my apartment two blocks away on East Ninth : " Winner calls the shots ! " she cried , and off we went  --  I triumphed , but only by the length of a brownstone , and at the apartment , breathless from the race she 'd run me , I said , " Okay , the spoils : take off your clothes , " which she gladly ( and rapidly ) proceeded to do in the hallway where we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ; very interesting . Oh yes , she was fast , that girl  --  but I was faster , was I not ? . . . Also , I should mention here , Maureen had these scores to settle with my sex , and rather large delusions about her gifts , which she had come to believe lay somewhere , anywhere , in the arts . At the age of sixteen , an eleventh-grader , she had run away from her family 's home in Elmira  --  a runaway , that got me too . I 'd never met a real one before . What did her father do ? " Everything . Nothing . Handyman . Night watchman . Who remembers any more ? " Her mother ? " Kept house . Drank . Oh , Christ , Peter , I forgot them long ago . And they , me . " She ran off from Elmira to become  --  of course , an actress . . . but of all places , to Rochester . " What did I know ? " she said , dismissing her innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that innocence . In Rochester she met Mezik ( " married the brute  --  and then met his buddy " ) , and after three yearsp177of frustration with the second-raters in the local avant-garde theater group , switched to art school to become  --  an abstract painter . Followingher divorce , she gave up painting  --  and the painter whose mistress she had become during her separation from Mezik and who had broken his " promise " to help get her in with his dealer in Detroit  --  and took harpsichord lessons while waiting on tables in Cambridge , Massachusetts , a town she 'd heard had fewer types like Mezik in residence . There , just twenty-one , she married Walker of the Brattle Theater ; five long years followed , of him and his Harvard boys . By the time we met , she had already tried wood sculpture in Greenwich Village ( her teacher 's wife was fiercely jealous of her , so she dropped it ) and was back " in the theater , " temporarily " in the production end "  --  that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street . As I say , I believed all these reversals and recoveries , all this movement of hers , to be evidence of a game , audacious , and determinedlittle spirit ; and it was , it was . So too did this mess of history argue for a certain instability and lack of focus in her life . On the other hand , there was so much focus to my own , and always had been , that Maureen 's chaotic , daredevil background had a decidedlyexotic and romantic appeal . She had been around  --  and around . I liked that idea ; I had n't been anywhere really , not quite yet . She was also something of a rough customer , and that was new to me too . At the time I took up with Maureen , I had for nearly a year been having a passionate affair with a college girl named Dina Dornbusch , a senior at Sarah Lawrence and the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family from Long Island . She was an ambitious literature and language major , and we met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four other coeds and a Mademoiselleeditor , to interview me about my work . I had just gotten out of the army , and my " work " at the time consisted only of the six short stories that had been published in the quarterlies while I had been stationed in Frankfurt ; that they had been read byp178these awed young girls was very nice to know . I already knew of course that they had been read with interest by New York book publishers and literary agents , for their numerous letters of inquiry had reached me in Germany , and upon returning to the U.S. after my discharge , I had chosen an agent and subsequently signed a publisher 's contract that provided me with a modest advance for the novel I was writing . But that I had , while serving as a draftee in Germany , achieved enough " fame " for these girls to settle on me as the young American writer they wished to interview for a feature in the magazine , well , needless to say , that opened up a fantasy or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them about Flaubert , about Salinger , about Mann , about my experiences in Germany and how I thought I might put them to use in fiction , but nonetheless I was wondering throughout how to get the girl with the marvelous legs and the earnest questions to stay behind when the others left . Oh , why did I forsake Dina Dornbusch  --  for Maureen ! Shall I tell you ? Because Dina was still in college writing papers on " the technical perfection " of " Lycidas . " Because Dina listened to me so intently , was so much my student , taking my opinions for her own . Because Dina 's father gave us front-row seats to Broadway musicals that we had to go to see for fear of offending him . Because  --  yes , this is true , too ; incredible , but true  --  because when Dina came in to visit me from school , practically all we did , from the moment she stepped into the doorway , was fuck . In short , because she was rich , pretty , protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clever , confident , ambitious  --  that 's why I gave her up for Maureen ! She was a girl still , who had just about everything . I , I decided at twenty-five , was beyond " that . " I wanted something called " a woman . At twenty-nine , with two unhappy marriages behind her , with no rich , doting father , no gorgeous clothes , and no future , Maureen seemed to me to have earned all that was implied by that noun ; she was certainly the first person of her sex I had ever known intimately to be so completely adrift and on her own . " I 've always been more orp179less in business for myself , " she 'd told me at the party where we 'd met  --  straight , unsentimental talk , and I liked it . With Dina , everybodyseemed always to be in business for her . Likewise with myself . Prior to Maureen , the closest I had come to a girl who had known real upheaval in her life was Grete , the student nurse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the advancing Russian army . I used to be fascinated by whatever she could tell me about her experience of the war , but that turned out to be next to nothing . Only a child of eight when the war ended , all she could remember of it was living in the country with her brothers and sisters and her mother , on a farm where they had eggs to eat , animals to play with , and spelling and arithmetic to learn in the village school . She remembered that when the family , in flight in the spring of ' 45 , finally ran into the American army , a GI had given her an orange ; and on the farm sometimes , when the children were being particularly noisy , her mother used to put her hands up to her ears and say , " Children , quiet , quiet , you sound like a bunch of Jews . " But that was as much contact as she seemed to have had with the catastrophe of the century . This did not make it so simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn make it easy for Grete . Our affair frequently bewildered her because of my moodiness , and when she then appeared to be innocent of what it was that had made me sullen or short-tempered , I became even more difficult . Of course , she had been only eight when the European war ended  --  nonetheless , I could never really believe that she was simply a big , sweet , good-natured , commonsensical eighteen-year-old girl who did not care very much that I was a dark Jew and she a blonde Aryan . This suspiciousness , and my self-conscious struggle with it , turned up in the affair between the two young lovers depicted in A Jewish Father . What I liked , you see , was something taxing in my love affairs , something problematical and puzzling to keep the imagination going even while I was away from my books ; I liked most being with young women who gave me something to think about , and not necessarily because we talked together about " ideas . "  |p180So  , Maureen was a rough customer  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " up "  --  nice word  --  to someone with her history and determination . It would seem by the way I hung in there that I decided that I at least ought to be . I had been up to Grete and the problems she raised for me , had I not ? Why back away from difficulties , or disorder , or even turbulence  --  what was there to be afraid of ? I honestly did n't know . Besides , for a very long time , the overwhelming difficulty  --  Maureen 's helplessness  --  was largely obscured by the fight in her and by the way in which she cast herself as the victim always of charlatans and ingrates , rather than as a person who had n't the faintest idea of the relationship of beginning , middle , and end . When she fought me , I was at first so busy fighting back I did n't have time to see her defiance as the measure of her ineptitude and desperation . Till Maureen I had never even fought a man in anger  --  with my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at twentyfivethan I am now and learned quickly enough how to disarm her of her favorite weapon , the spike of a high-heeled shoe . EventuallyI came to realize that not even a good shaking such as parents administer to recalcitrant children was sufficient to stop her once she was on the warpath  --  it required a slap in the face to do that . " Just like Mezik ! " screamed Maureen , dropping dramatically to the floor to cower before my violence ( and pretending as best she could that it did not give her pleasure to have uncovered the brute in the high-minded young artist ) . Of course by the time I got around to hitting her I was already in over my head and looking around for a way out of an affair that grew more distressing and bewildering  --  and frightening  --  practically by the hour . It was not only the depths of acrimony between us that had me reeling , but the shocking realization of this helplessness of hers , that which drove her to the episodes of wild and reckless rage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nothing she did ever worked  --  or , rather , I had finally come to penetrate the obfuscating rhetoric of betrayal and victimizationp181in order to see it that way : the Christopher Street producer went back on his " promise " to lift her from the ticket office into the cast ; the acting teacher in the West Forties who needed an assistant turned out to be a " a psychotic " ; her boss at one job was " a slave driver , " at the next , " a fool , " at the next , " a lecher , " and invariably , whenever she quit in disgust or was fired and came home in angry tears  --  whenever yet another of those " promises " that people were forever making to her had been broken  --  she would return to my basement apartment in the middle of the day to find me over the typewriter , pouring sweat  --  as happens when I 'm feeling fluent  --  and reeking through my button-down oxford shirt like a man who 'd been out all day with the chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at what I wanted most to do , her rage at the world of oppressors was further stoked by jealousy of me  --  even though , as it happened , she greatly admired my few published stories , defended them vehemently against all criticism , and enjoyedvicariously the small reputation that I was coming to have . But then vicariousness was her nemesis : what she got through men was all she got . No wonder she could neither forgive nor forget him who had wronged her by " forcing " her at sixteen into bed with his buddy , or him who preferred the flesh of Harvard freshmen to her own ; and if she could not relinquish the bartender Mezik or the bit player Walker , imagine the meaning she must have found in one whose youthful earnestness and single-minded devotion to a high artistic calling might magically become her own if only she could partake forever of his flesh and blood . Our affair was over ( except that Maureen would n't move out , and I had n't the sense , or the foresight , to bequeath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight ; having never before been defeated in my life in anything that mattered , I simply could not recognize defeat as a possibility for me , certainly not at the hands of someone seemingly so inept )  --  our affair was over , but for the shouting , when Maureen told me . . . Well , you can guess what she told me . Anybody could have seen it coming a mile away.  |p182Only  I did n't . Why would a woman want to fool Peter Tarnopol ? Why would a woman want to tell me a lie in order to get me to marry her ? What chance for happiness in such a union ? No , no , it just could not be . No one would be so silly and stupid as to do a thing like that and certainly not to me . I Had Just Turned TwentySix . I Was Writing A Serious Novel . I Had My Whole Life Ahead Of Me . No  --  the way I pictured it , I would tell Maureen that this affair of ours had obviously been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but a nightmare for both of us . " As much my fault as yours , Maureen "  --  I did n't believe it , but I would say it , for the sake of getting out without further altercation ; the only sensible solution , I would say , was for each now to go his own separate way . How could we be anything but better off without all this useless conflict and demeaning violence in our lives ? " We just "  --  I would tell her , in straight , unsentimental talk such as she liked to use herself  --  " we just do n't have any business together any more . " Yes , that 's what I would say , and she would listen and nod in acquiescence ( she would have to  --  I would be so decent about it , and so sensible ) and she would go , with me wishing her good luck . It did n't work out that way . Actually it was in the midst Of one of the ten or fifteen quarrels that we had per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and take up writing herself , that I told her to leave . The argument , which began with her accusing me of trying to prevent her from writing fiction because I was " frightened " of competition from a woman , ended with her sinking her teeth into my wrist  --  whereupon , with my free hand , I bloodied her nose . " You and Mezik ! No difference at all ! " The barkeeper , she claimed , used to draw blood from her every single day during the last year of their married life  --  he had turned her nose " into a faucet . " For me it was a first , however  --  and a shock . Likewise her teeth in my flesh was like nothing I had ever known before in my stable and unbloody past . I had been raised to be fearful and contemptuousof violence as a means of settling disputes or venting angerp183my idea of manliness had little to do with dishing out physical punishment or being able to absorb it . Nor was I ashamed that I could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in fact unmanning , as disgraceful as her teeth marks on my wrist . " Go ! " I screamed , " Get out of here ! " And because she had never seen me in such a state before  --  I was so unhinged by rage that while she packed her suitcase I stood over her tearing the shirt off my own body  --  she left , borrowing my spare typewriter , however , so she could write a story about " a heartless infantile son-of-a-bitch socalledartist just like you ! " " Leave that typewriter where it is ! " " But what will I write on then ? " " Are you kidding ? Are you crazy ? You 're going to expose ' me , and you want me to give you the weapon to do it with ? " " But you have two of them ! Oh , I 'm going to tell the world , Peter , I 'll tell them just what a selfish , self-important , egomaniacal baby you are ! " " Just go , Maureen  --  and I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucking screaming and arguing and biting around here when I am trying to do my work ! " " Oh fuck your high and mighty work ! What about my life ! " " Fuck your life , it 's not my affair any longer ! Get out of here ! Oh , take it  --  take it and just go ! " Maybe she thought ( now that my shirt was hanging off me in strips ) that I might start in next tearing her to shreds  --  for all at once she backed off and was out of the apartment , taking with her , to be sure , the old gray Remington Royal portable that had been my parents ' bar mitzvah present to the hotshot assistant sports editor of the Yonkers High Broadcaster . Three days later she was back at the door , in blue duffel coat and knee socks , wan and scrappy looking as a street urchin . Because she could not face her top-floor room on Carmine Street alone , she had spent the three days with friends of hers , a Village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who in turn considered me and my narratives " square . " The husband ( advertised by Maureen as " an old friend of Kenneth Patchen 's " ) had been Maureen 's teacher when she first came to New York and went into woodp184sculpture . Months back she had declared that she had been badly misled by these two " schizorenos , " but never explained how . As was her way the morning after even the most horrendous scenes , she laughed off the violent encounter of three days earlier , asking me ( in wonderment at my naivete ) how I could take seriouslyanything she may have said or done in anger . One aspect of my squareness ( according to those who worked in wood ) was that I had no more tolerance for the irregular or the eccentric than George F. Babbitt of Zenith , Middle America . I was not open to experience in my basement apartment on East Ninth the way those middle-aged beatniks were in their Bleecker Street loft . I was a nice Jewish boy from Westchester who cared only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am , " I told her , " otherwise you 'd be at the bottom of the East River . " She was sitting in a chair , still in her duffel coat ; I had given no sign that I had any intention of allowing her to move back in . When she had gone to peck me on the cheek in the doorway , I had  --  again , to her amusement  --  pulled my head away . " Where 's the typewriter ? " I asked , my way of saying that as far as I was concerned the only excuse Maureen could have to be visiting me was to return what she had borrowed . " You middleclassmonster ! " she cried . " You throw me out into the street . I have to go sleep on somebody 's floor with sixteen cats lapping my face all night long  --  and all you can think about is your portable typewriter ! Your things . It 's a thing , Peter , a thing  --  and I 'm a human being ! " " You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was lonely . You do n't understand that because you have ice in your heart instead of feelings . And my own place is n't a place , ' as you so blithely put it  --  it 's a shithole of an attic and you know it ! You would n't sleep there for half an hour . " " Where 's the typewriter ? " " The typewriter is a thing , damn it , an inanimate object ! What about me ? " and leaping from the chair , she charged , swingingher pocketbook like a shillelagh . " CLIP ME WITH THAT , MAUREEN , AND I 'LL KILL YOU ! " " Do it ! " was her reply . " Killp185me ! Some man 's going to  --  why not a civilized ' one like you ! Why not a follower of Flaubert ! " Here she collapsed against me , and with her arms around my neck , began to sob . " Oh , Peter , I do n't have anything . Nothing at all . I 'm really lost , baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to . Please , do n't make me go away again right now . I have n't even had a shower in three days . Let me just take a shower . Let me just calm down  --  and this time I 'll go forever , I promise . " She then explained that the loft on Bleecker Street had been burglarized one night when all except the cats were out eating spaghetti on Fourteenth Street ; my typewriter had been stolen , along with all of her friends ' wood-carving tools , their recorders , and their Blatstein , which sounded to me like an automatic rifle but was a painting . I did n't believe a word of it . She went off to the bathroom , and when I heard the shower running , I put my hand into the pocket of her duffel coat and after just a little fishing around in the crumpled Kleenex and the small change came up with a pawn ticket . If I had n't been living half a block from the Bowery , I do n't imagine it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the street for the cash . But I was learning  --  though not quite fast enough . Now an even worldlier fellow than myself  --  George F. Babbitt , say , of Zenith  --  would have remembered the old business adage , " Cut your losses , " and after finding the pawn ticket , would have dropped it back into her pocket and said nothing . Shower her , humor her , and get her the hell out , George F. Babbitt would have said to himself , and peace and quiet will reign once again . Instead I rushed into the bathroom  --  no Babbitt I  --  where we screamed at each other with such ferocity that the young married couple upstairs , whose life we made a misery during these months ( the husband , an editor at a publishing house , cuts me to this day ) , began to pound on the floor above with a broom handle . " You petty little thief ! You crook ! " " But I did it for you ! " " For me ? You pawned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are you talk/ing about ? " Here , with the water still beating down on her , she slumped to the bottom of the bathtub , and sitting on her haunches , began actually to keen in her woe . Unclothed , she would sometimesmake me think of an alley cat  --  quick , wary , at once scrawny and strong ; now , as she rocked and moaned with grief under the full blast of the shower , something about the weight and pointiness of her large conical breasts , and her dark hair plastered to her head , made her look to me like some woman out of the bush , a primitive whose picture you might come upon in National Geographic , praying to the sun-god to roll back the waters . " Because  --  " she howled , " because I 'm pregnant . Because  --  because I was n't going to tell you . Because I was going to get the money however I could and get an abortion and never bother you again . Peter , I 've been shoplifting too . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . I had to ! " " But you ca n't be pregnant , Maureen  --  we have n't slept together for weeks ! " " BUT I AM ! TWO MONTHS PREGNANT ! " " Two months ? " " Yes ! And I never said a word , because I did n't want to interfere with your ART ! " " Well , you should have , goddam it , because I would have given you the money to go out and get an abortion ! " " Oh , you are so generous  --  ! But it 's too late  --  I 've taken enough from men like you in my life ! You 're going to marry me or I 'm going to kill myself ! And I will do it ! " she cried , hammering defiantly on the rim of the tub with her two little fists . " This is no empty threat , Peter  --  I can not take you people any more ! You selfish , spoiled , immature , irresponsibleIvy League bastards , born with those spoons in your mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even she knew that much , but she was hysterical , and in hysteria , as she eventually made clear to me , anything goes . " With your big fat advance and your high Art  --  oh , you make me sick the way you hide from life behind that Art of yours ! I hate you and I hate that fucking Flaubert , and you are going to marry me , Peter , because I have had enough ! I 'm not going to be another man 's helpless vic- " That girl " was how she referred to Dina , toward whom she had never until that moment been anything but dismissive ; now , all at once , she invoked in her own behalf not just Dina , but Grete and the Pembroke undergraduate who had been my girl friend during my senior year at Brown . All of them shared with Maureen the experience of being " discarded " when I had finished having my " way " with them . " But we are not leftovers , Peter ; we 're not trash or scum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are human beings , and we will not be thrown into a garbage pail by you ! " " You 're not pregnant , Maureen , and you know damn well you 're not . That 's what all this we ' business is about , " I said , suddenly , with perfect confidence . And with that , she all but collapsed  --  " We 're not talking about me right now , " she said , " we 're talking about you . Do n't you know yet why you got rid of your Pembroke pal ? Or your German girl friend ? Or that girl who had everything ? Or why you 're getting rid of me ? " I said , " You 're not pregnant , Maureen . That is a lie . " " It is not  --  and listen to me ! Do you have no idea at all why it is you are so afraid of marriage and children and a family and treat women the way that you do ? Do you know what you really are , Peter , aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , " A fag . " " That 's right ! And making light of it does n't make it any less true ! " " I would think it makes it more true . " " It does ! You are the most transparent latent homosexual I have ever run across in my life ! Just like big brave Mezik who forced me to blow his buddy  --  so that he could watch . Because it 's really what he wanted to do himself  --  but he did n't even have the guts for that ! " " Forced you ? Oh , come on , pal , you 've got pointy teeth in that mouth of yours  --  I 've felt your fangs . Why did n't you bite it off and teach them both a lesson , if you were being forced to ? " " I should have ! Do n't you think I did n't think of it ! Do n't you think a woman does n't think of it every time ! And do n't you worry , mister , if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitten the thing off at the root ! And spit on the bleedingstump  --  just like I spit on you , you high and mighty Artist , forp188throwing me two months pregnant out into the street ! " But she was weeping so , that the spittle meant for me just rolled down her lips onto her chin . She slept in the bed that night ( first bed in three days , I was reminded ) and I sat at my desk in the living room , thinking about running away  --  not because she continued to insist she had missed two periods in a row , but because she was so tenaciously hanging on to what I was certain was a lie . I could leave right then for any number of places . I had friends up in Providence , a young faculty couple who 'd gladly put me up for a while . I had an army buddy in Boston , graduate-school colleagues still out in Chicago , there was my sister Joan in California . And of course brother Morris uptown , if I should require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take me in for as long as was necessary , no questionsasked . Since I 'd settled in New York , I had been getting phone calls from Moe every couple of weeks checking to see if there was anything I needed and reminding me to come to dinner whenever I was in the mood . At his invitation I had even taken Maureen up to their apartment one Sunday morning for bagels and the smoked fish spread . To my surprise , she had appeared rather cowed by my brother 's bearish manner ( Moe is a great one to cross-examine strangers ) , and the general intensity of the family life seemed to make her morose ; she did not have much to say after we left , except that Moe and I were very different people . I agreed ; Moe was very much the public man ( the university , the UN commissions , political meetings and organizations ever since high school ) and very much the paterfamilias . . . She said , " I meant he 's a brute . " " A what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . It 's unspeakable . " " He 's nuts about her , for Christ 's sake . " " Oh ? Is that why he walks all over her ? What a little sparrow she is ! Has she ever had an idea of her own in her life ? She just sits there , eating his crumbs . And that 's her life . " " Oh , that 's not her life , Maureen . " " Sorry , I do n't like him  --  or her . " Moe did n't like Maureen either , but at the outset said nothing ,  |p189assuming  it was my affair not his , and that she was just the girl of the moment . As I had assumed myself . But when combat between Maureen and me stepped up dramatically , and I apparently began to look and sound as confused and embattled as I 'd become , Moe tried on a couple of occasions to give me some brotherly advice ; each time I shook him off . As I still could n't imagine any longrangecalamity befalling me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I thought of it  --  particularly by someone whose life , though admirable , was grounded in ways I was just too young to be concerned about . As I saw it , it was essential for me to be able to confront whatever troubles I 'd made for myself without his , or anyone else 's , assistance . In brief , I was as arrogant ( and blind ) as youth and luck and an aristocratic literary bent could make me , and so , when he invited me up to Columbia for lunch I told him , " I 'll work it all out , do n't worry . " " But why should it be work ' ? Your work is your work , not this little Indian . " " I take it that 's some kind of euphemism . For the record , the mother 's family was Irish , the father 's German . " " Yeah ? She looks a little Apache to me , with those eyes and that hair . There 's something savage there , Peppy . No ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay later . You were n't brought up for savagery , kid . " " I know . Nice boy . Jewish . " " What 's so bad about that ? You are a nice civilized Jewish boy , with some talent and some brains . How much remains to be seen . Why do n't you attend to that and leave the lions to Hemingway . " " What is that supposed to mean , Moey ? " " You . You look like you 've been sleeping in the jungle . " " Nope . Just down on Ninth Street . " " I thought girls were for fun , Pep . Not to scare the shit out of you . " I was offended both by his low-mindedness and his meddling and refused to talk further about it . Afterward I looked in the mirror for the signs of fear  --  or doom . I saw nothing : still looked like Tarnopol the Triumphant to me . The morning after Maureen had announced herself pregnant , I told her to take a specimen of urine to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I without hiding my skepticism , we couldp190shortly learn just how pregnant she was . " In other words , you do n't believe me . You want to close your eyes to the whole thing ! " " Just take the urine and shut up . " So she did as she was told : took a specimen of urine to the drugstore for the pregnancy test  --  only it was n't her urine . I did not find this out until three years later , when she confessed to me ( in the midst of a suicide attempt ) that she had gone from my apartment to the drugstore by way of Tompkins Square Park , lately the hippie center of the East Village , but back in the fifties still a place for the neighborhood poor to congregate and take the sun . There she approached a pregnant Negro woman pushing a baby carriage and told her she represented a scientific organization willing to pay the woman for a sample of her urine . Negotiations ensued . Agreement reached , they retired to the hallway of a tenement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant woman pulled her underpantsdown to her knees , and squatting in a corner of the unsavory hallway  --  still heaped with rubbish ( just as Maureen had described it ) when I paid an unsentimental visit to the scene of the crime upon my return to New York only a few years later  --  delivered forth into Maureen 's preserve jar the stream that sealed my fate . Here Maureen forked over two dollars and twenty-five cents . She drove a hard bargain , my wife . During the four days that we had to wait  --  according to Maureen  --  for the result of the pregnancy test , she lay on my bed recalling scenes and conversations out of her wasted past : delirious ( or feigning delirium  --  or both ) , she quarreled once again with Mezik , screamed her hatred at Mezik 's buddy from the upholstery factory , and choked and wept with despair to discover Walker in their bathroom in Cambridge , dressed in her underwear , his own white sweat socks stuffed into the cups of the brassiere . She would not eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me telephone the psychiatrist who had once tried treating her for a couple of months ; when I called her friends over on Bleecker Street , she refused to talk to them . I went ahead anyway and suggested to them that they might want to come over and see her  --  maybe they at leastp191could get her to eat something  --  whereupon the wife grabbed the phone away from the husband and said , " We do n't want to see that one again ever , " and hung up . So , all was not well with the " schizorenos " on Bleecker Street either , after Maureen 's brief visit . . . And I was afraid now to leave the apartment for fear that she would try to kill herself when I was gone . I had never lived through three such days before in my life , though I was to know a hundred more just as grim and frightening in the years to come . The night before we were to learn the test results , Maureen abruptly stopped " hallucinating " and got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice . At first she would n't speak directly to me , but for an hour sat perfectly still , calm and controlled , in a chair in the living room , wrapped in my bathrobe . Finally I told her that as she was up and around , I was going out to take a walk around the block . " Do n't try anything , " I said , " I 'm just going to get some air . " Her tone , in response , was mild and sardonic . " Air ? Oh , where , I wonder ? " " I 'm taking a walk around the block . " " You 're about to leave me , Peter , I know that . Just the way you 've left every girl you 've ever known . Find ' em-fuck ' emand-forget'em Flaubert . " " I 'll be right back . " When I unlatched the door to go out , she said , as though addressing a judge from the witness stand  --  prophetic bitch !  --  " And I never saw him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugstore and asked the pharmacist if by any chance the result of Mrs. Tarnopol 's pregnancy test  --  so Maureen had identified herself , just a bit prematurely  --  due back tomorrow might have come in that night . He told me the result had come in that morning . Maureen had gotten it wrong  --  we had n't to wait four days , only three . Was the error inadvertent ? Just one of her " mistakes " ? ( " So I make mistakes ! " she 'd cry . " I 'm not perfect , damn it ! Why must everybody in this world be a perfect robot  --  a compulsive little middle-class success machine , like you ! Some of us are human . " ) But if not a mistake , if intentional , why ? Out of habit ? An addiction to falsification ? Or was this her art of fiction , " creativity " gone awry . . . ?  |p192Harder  to fathom was the result . How could Maureen be pregnant for two whole months and manage to keep it from me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  represented everything she was not . Why would she have let me throw her out that first time without striking back with this secret ? It made no sense . It could not be . Only it was . Two months pregnant , by me . Only how ? I could not even remember the last time we two had had intercourse . Yet she was pregnant , somehow , and if I did n't marry her , she would take her life rather than endure the humiliation of an abortion or an adoption or of abandoning a fatherless child . It went without saying that she , who could not hold a job for more than six months , was incapable of raising a child on her own . And it went without saying  --  to me , to me  --  that the father of this fatherless child-to-be was Peter Tarnopol . Never once did it occur to me that if indeed she were pregnant , someone other than I might have done it . Yes , I already knew what a liar she was , yet surely not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious as fatherhood . That I could n't believe . This woman was not a character out of a play by Strindberg or a novel by Hardy , but someone with whom I 'd been living on the Lower East Side of Manhattan , sixty minutes by subway and bus from Yonkers , where I 'd been born . Now , unduly credulous as I may have been , I still need n't have married her ; had I been so independent , so manly , so " up " to travail as I aspired to be in my middle twenties , she would never have become my wife , even if a laboratory test had " scientifically " proved that she was with child and even if I had been willing to accept on faith that mine was the penis responsible . I could still have said this : " You want to kill yourself , that 's your business . You do n't want an abortion , also up to you . But I 'm not getting married to you , Maureen , under any circumstances . Marrying you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her just that , I walked from Ninth Street all the way up to Columbia and back , concludingp193on upper Broadway  --  only two blocks from Morris 's building  --  that the truly manly way to face up to my predicament was to go back to the apartment , pretending that I still did not know the result of the pregnancy test , and deliver the following oration : " Maureen , what 's been going on here for three days makes no sense . I do n't care if you 're pregnant or not . I want you to marry me , regardless of how the test comes out tomorrow . I want you to be my wife . " You see , I just could n't believe , given her behavior during the past three days , that she was bluffing about doing herself in ; I was sure that if I walked out on her for good , she would kill herself . And that was unthinkable  --  I could not be the cause of another 's death . Such a suicide was murder . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would do my best to make it appear that in marrying her I had acted out of choice rather than necessity , for if our union were to be anything other than a nightmare of recrimination and resentment , it would have to appear to Maureen  --  and even , in a way , to me  --  that I had married her because I had decided that I wanted to , rather than because I had been blackmailed , or threatened , or terrorized into it . But why ever would I want to ? The whole thing made no sense  --  especially as we had not copulated in God only knew how long ! And I never wanted to again ! I hated her . Yes , it was indeed one of those grim and unyielding predicaments such as I had read about in fiction , such as Thomas Mann might have had in mind when he wrote in an autobiographical sketch the sentence that I had already chosen as one of the two portentousepigraphs for A Jewish Father : " All actuality is deadly earnest , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to be true to the guileless unrealism of our youth . " It seemed then that I was making one of those moral decisions that I had heard so much about in college literature courses . But how differentit all had been up in the Ivy League , when it was happening to Lord Jim and Kate Croy and Ivan Karamazov instead of to me . Oh , what an authority on dilemmas I had been in the senior honors seminar ! Perhaps if I had not fallen so in love with these compli/cated fictions of moral anguish , I never would have taken that longI anguished walk to the Upper West Side and back , and arrived at what seemed to me the only " honorable " decision for a young man as morally " serious " as myself . But then I do not mean to attribute my ignorance to my teachers , or my delusions to books . Teachers and books are still the best things that ever happened to me , and probably had I not been so grandiose about my honor , my integrity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would never have been so susceptible to a literary education and its attendantpleasures to begin with . Nor would I have embarked upon a literary career . And it 's too late now to say that I should n't have , that by becoming a writer I only exacerbated my debilitating obsession . Literature got me into this and literature is gon na have to get me out . My writing is all I 've got now , and though it happens not to have made life easy for me either in the years since my auspiciousdebut , it is really all I trust . My trouble in my middle twenties was that rich with confidence and success , I was not about to settle for complexity and depth in books alone . Stuffed to the gills with great fiction  --  entranced not by cheap romances , like Madame Bovary , but by Madame Bovary  --  I now expected to find in everyday experience that same sense of the difficult and the deadly earnest that informed the novels Iadmired most . My model of reality , deduced from reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , a reality as obdurate and recalcitrant and ( in addition ) as awful as any I could have wished for in my most bookish dreams . You might even say that the ordeal that my daily life was shortly to become was only Dame Fortune smiling down on " the golden boy of American literature " ( New York Times Book Review , September 1959 ) and dishing out to her precocious favorite whatever literary sensibilityrequired . Want complexity ? Difficulty ? Intractability ? Want the deadly earnest ? Yours ! Of course what I also wanted was that my intractable existence should take place at an appropriately lofty moral altitude , an elevation somewhere , say , between The Brothers Karamazov andp195The Wings of the Dove . But then not even the golden can expect to have everything : instead of the intractability of serious fiction , I got the intractability of soap opera . Resistant enough , but the wrong genre . Though maybe not , given the leading characters in the drama , of which Maureen , I admit , was only one . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been gone nearly three hours . Maureen , to my surprise , was now completely dressed and sitting at my desk in her duffel coat . " You did n't do it , " she said , and lowering her face to the desk , began to cry . " Where were you going , Maureen ? " Probably back to her room ; I assumed to the East River , to jump in . " I thought you were on a plane to Frankfurt . " " What were you going to do , Maureen ? " " What 's the difference . .. " " Maureen ! Look up at me . " " Oh , what 's the difference any more , Peter . Go , go back to that Long Island girl , with her pleated skirts and her cashmere sweaters . " " Maureen , listen to me : I want to marry you . I do n't care whether you 're pregnant or not . I do n't care what the test says tomorrow . I want to marry you . " I sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high-school play . I think it may have been in that moment that my face became the piece of stone I was to carry around on my neck for years thereafter . " Let 's get married , " I said , as if saying it yet again , another way , would fool anyone about my real feelings . Yet it fooled Maureen . I could have proposed in Pig Latin and fooled Maureen . She could of course carry on in the most bizarre and unpredictable ways , but in all those years of surprises , I would never be so stunned by her wildest demonstration of rage , her most reckless public ravings , as I was by the statement with which she greeted this proposal so obviously delivered without heart or hope . She erupted , " Oh , darling , we 'll be happy as kings ! "  |p196That  was the word  --  " kings , " plural  --  uttered wholly ingenuously . I do n't think she was lying this time . She believed that to be so . We would be happy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arms around me , as happy as I had ever seen her  --  and for the first time I realized that she was truly mad . I had just proposed marriage to a madwoman . In deadly earnest . " Oh , I always knew it , " she said joyously . " Knew what ? " " That you loved me . That you could n't hold out forever against that kind of love . Not even you . " She was crazy . And what did that make of me ? A " man " ? How ? She went on and on about the paradise that lay before us . We could move to the country and save money by growing our own vegetables . Or continue to live in the city where she could become my agent ( I had an agent , but no matter ) . Or she could just stay home and bake bread and type my manuscripts ( I typed my own , but no matter ) and get back to her wood sculpture . " You 'll have to stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , lovey , " she said . " I 'll do it  --  for you . Because you do love me . You see , that 's all I had to find out  --  that you loved me . That you were n't Mezik , that you were n't Walker . That I could trust you . Do n't you understand ? Now that I know , I 'll do anything . " " Meaning ? " " Peter , stop being suspicious  --  you do n't have to be any more . I 'll have an abortion . If the test comes back tomorrow saying that I 'm pregnant  --  and it will , I 've never missed two periods before in my life , never  --  but do n't worry , I 'll go off and get an abortion . Whatever you want , I 'll do it . I know of a doctor . In Coney Island . And I 'll go to him , if you want me to . " I wanted her to , all right . I 'd wanted her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would never have made my " manly " proposal of marriage . But better now than not at all . And so the next day , after I phoned the drugstore and pretended to be hearingp197for the first time the lab report verifying Mrs. Tarnopol 's pregnancy , I went to the bank and withdrew ten weeks ' worth of advance and another twenty dollars for the round-trip taxi fare to Coney Island . And on Saturday morning , I put Maureen in a taxi and she went off to Coney Island by herself , which she said was the only way the abortionist would receive his patients . I stood out on Second Avenue watching the cab move south , and I thought : " Now get out . Take a plane to anywhere , but go while the going is good . " But I did n't , because that is n't what a man like myself did . Or so I " reasoned . " Besides , in bed the night before , Maureen had wept in fearful anticipation of the illegal operation ( had she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I eventually found out ) and clinging to me , she begged , " You wo n't desert , me , will you ? You 'll be here when I get home  --  wo n't you ? Because I could n't take it if you were n't . . . " " I 'll be here , " said I , manfully . And there I was when she returned at four that afternoon , my fond lover , pale and wan ( the strain of sitting six hours at the movies ) , wearing a Kotex between her legs to absorb the blood ( said she ) , and still in pain from the abortion she had undergone ( said she ) without an anesthetic . She went immediately to bed to ward off the hemorrhage that she feared was coming on , and there she lay , on into the night , teeth chattering , limbs trembling , in an old , washed-out sweatshirt of mine and a pair of my pajamas. piled blankets on top of her , but that still did n't stop her shaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " and would n't give me anything for the pain but a tennis ball to squeeze . He promised he would put me out , on the phone he promised me , and then when I was on the table and said , Where 's the anesthetic ? ' , he said , What do you think , girlie , I 'm out of my mind ? ' I said , But you promised . How else can I possibly stand the pain ? ' And you know what he told me , that smelly old bastard ? Look , you want to get tip and go , fine with me . You want me to get rid of the baby , then squeeze the magic ball and shut up . You had your fun , now you 're going to have to pay . ' So I stayed , I stayed and I squeezed down onp198the ball , and I tried to think just about you and me , but it hurt , oh , he hurt me so much . " A horrifying tale of humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sex , and a lie from beginning to end . Only it took me a while to find out . In actuality , she had pocketed the three hundred dollars ( against the day I would leave her penniless ) and after disembarking from the cab when it got to Houston Street , had gone back up to Times Square by subway to see Susan Hayward in I Want to Live , saw it three times over , the morbid melodrama of a cocktail waitress ( if I remember correctly  --  I had already taken her to see it once myself ) who gets the death penalty in California for a crime she did n't commit : right up Maureen 's alley , that exemplary little tale . Then she 'd donned a Kotex in the washroom and had come on home , weak in the knees and white around the gills . As who would n't be , after a day in a Times Square movie house ? All this she confessed three years later in Wisconsin . The next morning I went alone to a booth  --  Maureen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was running away , leaving her bleeding and in pain while I disappeared forever with " that girl "  --  and telephoned my parents to tell them I was getting married . " Why ? " my father demanded to know . " Because I want to . " I was not about to tell my father , in whom I had not confided anything since I was ten , what I had been through in the past week . I had loved him dearly as a child , but he was only a small-time haberdasher , and I now wrote short stories published in the high-brow magazines and had a publisher 's advanceon a serious novel dense with moral ambiguity . So which of us could be expected to understand the principle involved ? Which was what again ? Something to do with my duty , my courage , my word . " Peppy , " my mother said , after having received the news in silence , " Peppy , I 'm sorry , but I have to say it  --  there 's something wrong with that woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years old , " said my father . " She 's twenty-nine . " " And you 're just twenty-six , you 're a babe in the woods . Son , she 's kicked around too long for my money . Your mother is right  --  something ai n't right there with her . " My parents had met my intended just once , in my apartment ; on the way home from a Wednesday matinee , they had stopped off to say hello , and there was Maureen , on my sofa , reading the script of a TV serial in which someone had " promised " her a part . Ten minutes of amiable , if self-conscious talk , and then they took the train back home . What they were saying about Maureen I assumed grew out of conversations with Morris and Lenore . I was wrong . Morris had never mentioned Maureen to them . They had figured her out on their own  --  after only ten minutes . I tried acting lighthearted ; laughing , I said , " She 's not the girl across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What does she even do for a living ? Anything ? " " She told you . She 's an actress . " " Where ? " " She 's looking for work . " " Son , listen to me : you 're a college graduate . You 're a summa cum laude . You had a four-year scholarship . The army is behind you . You 've traveled in Europe . The world is before you , and it 's all yours . You can have anything , anything  --  why are you settling for this ? Peter , are you listening ? " " I 'm listening . " " Peppy , " asked my mother , " do you  --  love her ? " " Of course I do . " And what did I want to shout into the phone at that very moment ? I 'm coming home . Take me home . This is n't what I want to do . You 're right , there 's something wrong with her : the woman is mad . Only I gave my word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound right to me . " " Well , I did n't expect this kind of reaction , frankly , when I said I would be getting married . "  | " We want you to be happy , that 's all , " said my mother . " This is going to make you happy , marrying her ? " asked my father . " I 'm not talking about that she 's Gentile . I 'm not a narrowmindeddope , I never was . I do n't live in a dead world . The Germangirl in Germany was something else , and her I never dislikedpersonally , you know that . But that 's water under the bridge . " " I know . I agree . " " I 'm talking about happiness now , with another human being . " Yes , I follow you . " " You do n't sound right , " he said , his own voice getting huskier with emotion . " You want me to come down to the city ? I 'll come in a minute  --  " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know what I 'm doing . I 'm doing what I want . " " But why so sudden ? " my father asked , fishing . " Can you answer me that ? I 'm sixty-five years old , Peppy , I 'm a grown man  --  you can talk to me , and the truth . " " What 's sudden ' about it ? I 've known her nearly a year . Please , do n't fight me on this . " " Peter , " said my mother , teary now , " we do n't fight you on anything . " " I know , I know . I appreciate that . So let 's not start now . I just called to tell you . A judge is marrying us on Wednesday at City Hall . " My mother 's voice was weak now , almost a whisper , when she asked , " You want us to come ? " It did n't sound as though she cared to be told yes . What a shock that was ! " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just a formality . I'llcall you afterwards . " " Peppy , are you still on the outs with your brother ? " " I 'm not on the outs with him . He lives his life and I live mine . " " Peter , have you spoken to him about this ? Peppy , your older brother is a brother boys dream about having . He adores you . Call him , at least . " " Look , it 's not a point I want to debate with Moe . He 's a greatp201arguer  --  and I 'm not . There 's nothing to argue over . " " Maybe he would n't argue . Maybe at least he 'd like to know , to come to whatever it is  --  the wedding ceremony . " " He wo n't want to come . " " And you wo n't talk to him , only for a few minutes ? Or to Joan ? " " What does Joan know about my life ? Dad , just let me get married , okay ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person for the rest of your life is an everyday affair . It ai n't . " " I 'm summa cum laude . I know that . " " Do n't joke . You left us when you were too young , that 's the problem . You always had your way . The apple of your mother 's eye  --  you could have anything . The last of her babies . . . " " Look , look  --  " " You thought you already knew everything at fifteen  --  remember ? We should never have let you skip all those grades and get ahead of yourself  --  that was our first mistake . " On the edge of tears now , I said , " That may be . But I would have been out of grade school by now anyway . Look , I 'm getting married . It 'll be all right . " And I hung up , before I lost control and told my father to come down and take'back to his home his twenty-six-year-old baby boy. 4 . DR . SPIELVOGELWe may incite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disappointed love , but no special technicaldesign is necessary for that purpose . These things happen spontaneously in most analyses.  --  Freud , " Analysis Terminable and Interminable " I first met Dr. Spielvogel the year Maureen and I were married . We had moved out of my Lower East Side basement apartmentp202to a small house in the country near New Milford , Connecticut , not far from where Spielvogel and his family were summering at Candlewood Lake . Maureen was going to grow vegetables and I was going to write the final chapters of A Jewish Father . As it turned out , the seeds never got in the ground ( or the bread in the oven , or the preserves in the jar ) , but because there was a twelve-by-twelve shack at the edge of the woods back of the house with a bolt on the door , somehow the book got finished . I saw Spielvogel maybe three times that summer at parties given by a New York magazine editor who was living nearby . I do n't remember that the doctor and I had much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this New York analyst summering in rural Connecticut , but otherwise he seemed at once dignified and without airs  --  a tall , quiet , decorous man , growing stout in his middle forties , with a mild German accent and that anomalous yachting cap . I never even noticed which woman was his wife ; I discovered later that he had noticed which was mine . When , in June of ' 6z , it became necessary , according to my brother , for me to remain in New York and turn myself over to a psychiatrist , I came up with Spielvogel 's name ; friends in Connecticutthat summer had spoken well of him , and , if I remembered right , treating " creative " people was supposed to be his specialty . Not that that made much difference to me in the shape I was in . Though I continued to write every day , I had really stopped thinking of myself as capable of creating anything other than misery for myself . I was not a writer any longer , no matter how I filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could not imagine how I could get to be anything else ever again . His appearance , like mine , had changed for the worse in three years . While I had been battling with Maureen , Spielvogel had been up against cancer . He had survived , though the disease appeared to have shrunk him down some . I remembered him of course in the yachting cap and with a summer tan ; in his office , he wore a drab suit bought to fit a man a size larger , and an un/expectedly bold striped shirt whose collar now swam around his neck . His skin was pasty , and the heavy black frames of the glasses he wore tended further to dramatize this shrinkage he had undergone  --  beneath them , behind them , his head looked like a skull . He also walked now with a slight dip , or list , to the left , the cancer having apparently damaged his hip or leg . In all , the doctor he reminded me of most was Dr. Roger Chillingworth in Hawthorne'sScarlet Letter . Appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shameful secrets as the Reverend Arthur Dimmesdale . Maureen and I had lived a year in western Connecticut , a year at the American Academy in Rome , and a year at the university in Madison , and as a result of all that moving around I had never bcen able to find anyone in whom I was willing to confide . By the end of three years I had convinced myself that it would be " disloyal , " a " betrayal , " to tell even the closest friends I had made in our wanderings what went on between Maureen and me in private , though I imagined they could guess plenty from what often took place right out on the street or in other people 's houses . Mostly I did n't open up to anyone because I was so ashamed of my defenselessnessbefore her wrath and frightened of what she might do either to herself or to me , or to the person in whom I 'd confided , if she ever found out what I had said . Sitting in a chair immediatelyacross from Spielvogel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of the Acropolis that was the only picture on his cluttered desk , I realized that I still could n't do it : indeed , to tell this stranger the whole sordid story of my marriage seemed to me as reprehensible as committing a serious crime . " You remember Maureen ? " I asked . " My wife ? " " I do . Quite well . " His voice , in contrast to his appearance , was strong and vigorous , causing me to feel even more puny and self-conscious . . . the little stool pigeon about to sing . My impulse was to get up and leave , my shame and humiliation ( and my disaster ) still my own  --  and simultaneously to crawl into his lap . " Ap204small , pretty , dark-haired young woman , " he said . " Very determined looking . " " Very . " " A lot of spunk there , I would think . " " She 's a lunatic , Doctor ! " I began to cry . For fully five minutes I sobbed into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " There are lines from my five years of psychoanalysis as memorableto me as the opening sentence of Anna Karenina  --  " Are you finished ? " is one of them . The perfect tone , the perfect tactic . I turned myself over to him , then and there , for good or bad . Yes , yes , I was finished . " All I do these days is collapse in tears . . . " I wiped my face with a Kleenex from a box that he offered me and proceeded to " spill "  --  though not about Maureen ( I could n't , right off ) but about Karen Oakes , the Wisconsin coed with whom I had been maniacally in love during the winter and early spring of that year . I had been watching her bicycle around the campus for months before she showed up in my undergraduate writing section in the second semester to become the smartest girl in the class . Good-natured , gentle , a beguiling mix of assertive innocence and shy adventurousness , Karen had a small lyrical gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyses of the fiction that we read in class ; her candor and lucidity , I told Spielvogel , were as much a balm to me as her mild temperament , her slender limbs , her pretty and composed American girl 's face . Oh , I went on and on about Ka-reen ( the pet name for the pillow talk ) , growing increasingly intoxicated , as I spoke , with memories of our ardent " passion " and brimming " love "  --  I did not mention that in all we probably had not been alone with one another more than forty-eight hours over the course of the three months , and rarely for more than forty-five minutes at a clip ; we were together either in the classroom with fifteen undergraduates for chaperones , or in her bed . Nonetheless she was , I said , " the first good thing " to happen in my private life since I 'd been discharged from the army and come to New York to write . I told Spielvogel how shep205had called herself " Miss Demi-Womanhood of 1962 " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remark as I had been , but then he had not just disrobed for the first time the demiwomanwho had said it . I recounted to him the agonies of doubt and longing that I had experienced before I went ahead , three weeks into the semester , and wrote " See me " across the face of one of her A+ papers . She came , as directed , to my office , and accepted my courtly , professorial invitation to be seated . In the first moments , courtliness was rampant , as a matter of fact . " You wanted to see me ? " " Yes , I did , Miss Oakes . " A silence ensued , long and opaquely eloquent enough to satisfy Anton Chekhov . " Where do you come from , Miss Oakes ? " " Racine . " " And what does your father do ? " " He 's a physician . " And then , as though hurling myself off a bridge , I did it : reached forward and laid a hand upon her straw-colored hair . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told her , " I could n't help it . " She said : " Professor Tarnopol , I 'm not a sophisticated person . " Whereupon I proceeded to apologize profusely . " Oh , please , do n't worry , " she said , when I would n't stop , " a lot of teachers do it . " " Do they ? " the awardwinningnovelist asked . " Every semester so far , " said she , nodding a little wearily ; " and usually it 's English . " " What happens then , usually ? " " I tell them I 'm not a sophisticated person . Because I 'm not . " " And then ? " " That 's it , generally . " " They get consciencestrickenand apologize profusely . " " They have second thoughts , I suppose . " " Just like me . " " And me , " she said , without blinking ; " the doctrine of in loco parentis works both ways . " " Look , look  --  " " Yes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You do n't even know nun , Professor Tarnopol . " " I do n't and I do . I 've read your papers . I 've read your stories and poems . " " I 've read yours . " Oh my God , Dr. Spielvogel , how can you sit there like an Indian ? Do n't you appreciate the charm of all this ? Ca n't you see what a conversation like that meant to me in my despair ? " Look , Miss Oakes , I want to see you  --  I have to see you ! " " Okay . " " Where ? " " I have a room  --  " " I ca n't go into a dormitory , you know that . " " I 'm a senior . I don'tp206live in the dorm any more . I moved out . " " You did ? " " I have my own room in town . " " Can I come to talk to you there ? " " Sure . " Sure ! Oh , what a wonderful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I went around sibilating it to myself all through the rest of the day . " What are you so bouncy about ? " asked Maureen . Shoor . Shewer . Shur . Now just how did that beautiful and clever and willing and healthy young girl say it anyway ? Sure ! Yes , like that  --  crisp and to the point . Sure ! Oh yes , sure as sure is sure , Miss Oakes is going to have an adventure , and Professor Tarnopol is going to have a breakdown . . . How many hours before I decided that when the semester was over we would run off together ? Not that many . The second time we were in bed I proposed the idea to Ka-reen . We would go to Italy in June  --  catch the Pan Am flight from Chicago ( I 'd checked on it by phone ) the evening of the day she 'd taken her last exam ; I could send my final grades in from Rome . Would n't that be terrific ? Oh , I would say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to take you somewhere , Ka-reen , I want to go away with you ! And she would murmursoftly , " Mmmmmm , mmmmmm , " which I interpreted as deliciousacquiescence . I told her about all the lovely Italian piazzas in which Maureen and I had screamed bloody murder at one another : the Piazza San Marco in Venice , the Piazza della Signoria in Florence , the Piazza del Campo in Siena . . . Karen went home for spring vacation and never came back . That 's how overbearing and frightening a character I had become . That murmuring was just the sound her good mind gave off as it gauged the dreadful consequences of having chosen this particular member of the **25;1493;TOOLONG faculty to begin sophisticated life with outside of a college dorm . It was one thing reading Tolstoy in class , another playing Anna and Vronsky with the professor . After she failed to return from spring recess , I made desperate phone calls to Racine practically daily . When I call at lunchtime I am told she is " out . " I refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who is this , please ? " I am asked . I mumble , " A friend fromp207school . . . are you sure she is n't . . . ? " " Would you care to leave your name ? " " No . " After dinner each night I last about ten minutesin the living room with Maureen before I begin to feel myself on the brink of cracking up ; rising from my reading chair , I throw down my pencil and my book  --  as though I am Rudolph Hess , twenty years in Spandau Prison , I cry , " I have to take a walk ! I have to see some faces ! I 'm suffocating in here ! " Once out the door , 1 break into a sprint , and crossing back lawns and leaping low garden fences , I head for the dormitory nearest our apartment , where there is a telephone booth on the first floor . I will catch Karen at the dinner hour and beg her at least to come back to school for the rest of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June to live in Trastevere with me . She says , " Hang on a sec  --  let me take it on another phone . " A few moments later I hear her call , " Will you hang up the downstairsphone , please , Mom ? " " Karen ! Karen ! " " Yes , I 'm back . " " Kareen , I ca n't bear it  --  I 'll meet you somewhere in Racine ! I 'll hitch ! I can be there by nine-thirty ! " But she was the smartest girl in my class and had no intention of letting some overwrought creative writing teacher with a bad marriage and a stalled career ruin her life . She could not save me from my wife , she said , I would have to do that myself . She had told her family she had had an unhappy love affair , but , she assured me , she had not and would not tell them with whom . " But what about your degree ? " I demanded , as though I were the dean of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Karen , speaking as calmly from her bedroom in Racine as she did in class . " But I love you ! I want you ! " I shouted at the slender girl who only the week before had bicycled in sneakers and a poplin skirt to English 312 , her straw-colored hair in braids and her innardsstill awash with semen from our lunchtime assignation in her rented room . " You just ca n't leave , Karen ! Not now ! Not after how marvelous it 's been ! " " But I ca n't save you , Peter . I 'm only twenty wars old . " In tears I cried , " I 'm only twenty-nine ! " " Peter , I should never have started up . I had no idea what was at stake . That 's my fault . Forgive me . I 'm as sorry as I can be . " " Christ , don'tp208be sorry '  --  lust come back ! " One night Maureen followed me out of the house and across the backyards to the dormitory , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the telephone booth , threw back the door while I was pleading with Karen yet again to change her mind and come with me to Europe on the Pan Am night flight from O'Hare . " Liar ! " screamed Maureen , " whoremongering liar ! " and ran back to the apartment to swallow a small handful of sleeping pills . Then , on hands and knees , she crawled into the living room in her underwear and knelt there on the floor with my Gillette razor in her hand , waiting patiently for me to finish talking with my undergraduate harlot and come on home so that she could get on with the job of almost killing herself . I told Spielvogel what Maureen had confessed to me from the living-room floor . Because this had happened only two months earlier , I found with Spielvogel , as I had that morning with Moe in the taxi back from the airport , that I could not recount the story of the false urine specimen without becoming woozy and weak , as though once the story surfaced in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fires of rage had raced through me , devouring all vitality and strength . It is not that easy for me to tell it today withoutat least a touch of vertigo . And I have never been able to introduce the story into a work of fiction , not that I have n't repeatedly tried and failed in the five years since I received Maureen 's confession . I can not seem to make it credible  --  probably because I still do n't entirely believe it myself . How could she ? To me ! No matter how I may contrive to transform low actuality into high art , that is invariably what is emblazoned across the face of the narrative , in blood : HOW COULD SHE ? TO ME ! " And then , " I told Spielvogel , " do you know what she said next ? She was on the floor with the blade of the razor right on her wrist . In her panties and bra . And I was just standing over her . Dumbstruck . Dumbstruck . I could have kicked her head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she say ? "  | " Say ? She said , If you forgive me for the urine , I 'll forgive you for your mistress . I 'll forgive you for deceiving me with that girl on the bicycle and begging her to run away with you to Rome . " And " And what did you do ? " asked Spielvogel . " Did I kick her , you mean ? No . No , no , no , no , no . I did n't do anything  --  toher . Just stood there for a while . I could n't right off get over the ingenuity of it . The relentlessness . That she had thought of such a thing and then gone ahead and done it . I actually felt admiration . And pity , pity ! That 's true . I thought , Good Christ , what are you ? To do this thing , and then to keep it a secret for three years ! ' And then I saw my chance to get out . As though it required this , you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that I went . Oh , I told her I was going , all right . I said , I 'm leaving , Maureen , I ca n't live any more with somebody who would do such a thing , and so on . But she was crying by then and she said , Leave me and I 'll cut my wrists . I 'm full of sleeping pills already . ' And I said , and this is true , I said , Cut them , why should I care ? ' And so she pressed down with the razor  --  and blood came out . It turned out that she had only scratched herself , but what the hell did I know ? She could have gone through to the bone . I started shouting , Do n't  --  do n't do that ! ' and I began wrestling with her for the razor . I was terrified that I was going to get my own veins slashed in the rolling around , but I kept trying to get it away , grabbing at the damn thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I do now is cry , you know  --  and she was crying , of course , and finally I got the thing away from her and she said , Leave me , and I 'll ruin that girl of yours ! I 'll have that pure little face in every paper in Wisconsin ! ' And then she began to scream about my deceiving ' her and how I could n't be trusted and she always knew it  --  and this is just three minutes after describing in detail to me buying the urine from that Negro woman on Avenue B ! " " And what did you do then ? " " Did I slit her throat from ear to ear ? No . No ! I fell apart . Completely . I went into a tantrum . The two of us were smeared withp210blood  --  my left palm had been cut , up by the thumb , and her wrist was dripping , and God only knows what we looked like  --  like a couple of Aztecs , fucking up the sacrificial rites . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am the Dagwood Bumstead of fear and trembling ! " " You had a tantrum . " " That 's not the half of it . I got down on my knees  --  I begged her to let me go . I banged my head on the floor , Doctor . I began runningfrom room to room . Then  --  then I did what she told me Walker used to do . Maybe Walker never even did it ; that was probably a lie too . Anyway , I did it . At first I was just running around looking for some place to hide the razor from her . I remember unscrewing the head and dropping the blade into the toilet and flushing and flushing and the damn thing just lying there at the bottom of the bowl . Then I ran into our bedroom  --  I was screaming all this time , you see , Let me go ! Let me go ! ' and sobbing , and so on . And all the while I was tearing my clothes off . I 'd done that before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually tore everything off me . And I put on Maureen 's underwear . I pulled open her dresser and I put on a pair of her underpants  --  I could just get them up over my prick . Then I tried to get into one of her brassieres . I put my arms through the shoulder loops , that is . And then I just stood there like that , crying  --  and bleeding . Finally she came into the room  --  no , she just got as far as the doorway and stood there , looking at me . And , you see , that 's all she was wearing , too , her underwear . She saw me and she broke into sobs again , and she cried , Oh , sweetheart , no , no . .. ' " " Is that all she said ? " asked Spielvogel . " Just called you ' sweet-heart ' ? " " No . She said , Take that off . I 'll never tell anybody . Just take that off right now . " That " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appearedthat I had nothing more to say . " Yes . " " And ? "  | " It 's not been good , Doctor . " " What do you mean ? " " I 've done some other strange things . " " Such as ? " " Such as staying with Maureen  --  that 's the strangest thing of all ! Three years of it , and now I know what I know , and I 'm still living with her ! And if I do n't fly back tomorrow , she says she 's going to tell the world everything . ' That 's what she told my brother to tell me on the phone . And she will . She will do it . " " Any other strange things ' ? " .. . with my sperm . " " I did n't hear you . Your sperm ? What about your sperm ? " " My semen  --  I leave it places . " " Yes ? " " I smear it places . I go to people 's houses and I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's houses ? " " No , no , " I said sharply  --  what did he think I was , a madman ? " I 'm invited . I go to the bathroom . I leave it somewhere . . . on the tap . In the soap dish . Just a few drops . .. " " You masturbate in their bathrooms . " " Sometimes , yes . And leave . . . " " Your signature . " " Tarnopol 's silver bullet . " He smiled at my joke ; I did not . I had still more to tell . " I 've done it in the university library . Smeared it on the bindings of books . " " Of books ? Which books ? " " Books ! Any books ! Whatever books are handy ! " " Anywhere else ? " I sighed . " Speak up , please , " said the doctor . " I sealed an envelope with it , " I said in a loud voice . " My bill to the telephone company . " Again Spielvogel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tarnopol. "  |p212And  again I broke into sobs . " What does it mean ! " " Come now , " said Dr. Spielvogel , " what do you think it means ' ? You do n't require a soothsayer , as far as I can see . " " That I 'm completely out of control ! " I said , sobbing . " That I do n't know what I 'm doing any more ! " " That you 're angry , " he said , slapping the arm of his chair . " That you are furious . You are not out of control  --  you are under control . Maureen 's control . You spurt the anger everywhere , except where it belongs . There you spurt tears . " " But she 'll ruin Karen ! She will ! She knows who she is  --  she used to check out my students like a hawk ! She 'll destroy that lovely innocent girl ! " " Karen sounds as if she can take care of herself . " " But you do n't know Maureen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She used to grab the wheel of our VW in Italy and try to run us off the side of a mountain  --  because I had n't opened a door for her leaving the hotel in Sorrento ! She could carry a grudge like that for days  --  then she would erupt with it , in the car , weeks later ! You ca n't imagine what it 's like when she goes wild ! " " Well , then , Karen should be properly warned , if that is the case . " " It is the case ! It 's hair-raising ! Grabbing the wheel from my hands and spinning it the other way when we 're winding down a mountain road ! You must believe what I 've been through  --  I am not exaggerating ! To the contrary , I 'm leaving things out ! " Now , with my avenger dead and her ashes scattered from a plane into the Atlantic Ocean , now with all that rage stilled , it seems to me that I simply could not have been so extensively unmanned by Maureen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I indicated ( and demonstrated ) to Spielvogel during our first hour together . I was , after all , bigger than she was , more intelligentthan she was , better educated than she was , and far more accomplished . What then ( I asked the doctor ) had made me suchp213a willing , or will-less , victim ? Why could n't I find the strength , or just the simple survival mechanism , to leave her once it became obvious that it was no longer she who needed rescuing from her disasters , but I from mine ? Even after she had confessed to committingthe urine fraud , even then I could n't get up and go ! Now why ? Why should someone who had battled so determinedly all his life to be independent  --  his own child , his own adolescent , his own man  --  why should someone with my devotion to " seriousness " and " maturity " knuckle under like a defenseless little boy to this cornball Clytemnestra ? Dr. Spielvogel invited me to look to the nursery for the answer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does your wife remind you of your mother ? " My heart sank . Psychoanalytic reductivism was not going to save me from the IRT tracks , or worse , from returning to Wisconsinat the end of the week to resume hostilities with Maureen . In reply to the question I said , no , she did not . My wife reminded me of no one I had ever known before , anywhere . Nobody in my entire lifetime had ever dared to deceive , insult , threaten , or blackmailme the way she did  --  certainly no woman I had ever known . Nor had anyone ever hollered at me like that , except perhaps the basic training cadre at Fort Dix . I suggested to Spielvogel that it was n't because she was like my mother that I could n't deal with her , but , if anything , because she was so unlike her . My mother was not aggrieved , contentious , resentful , violent , helpless , or suicidal , and she did not ever want to see me humbled  --  far from it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the two was that my mother adored me , worshipped me across the board , and I had basked in that adoration . Indeed , it was her enormous belief in my perfection that had very likely helped to spawn and nourish whatever gifts I had . I supposed that it could be said that I had knuckled under to my mother when I was still a little boy  --  but in a little boy that is not knuckling under , is it ? That is just common sense and a feel for family life : childhood realpolitik . Onep214does not expect to be treated like a thirty-year-old at five . But at fifteen I certainly did expect deferential treatment of a kind , and from my mother I got it . As I remember it , I could sweet-talk that lady into just about anything during my high-school years , without too much effort get her to agree to the fundamental soundness of my position on just about every issue arising out of my blooming sense of prerogatives ; in fact , it was with demonstrable delight ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince whom she had been leading all these years toward the throne . It was the supernumerary father I 'd had to struggle with back then . He was anxious for me in my ambitiousness and cockiness . He had seen less of me as a child  --  off in the store all day , and in bad times selling roofing and siding for his brother-in-law door to door at night  --  and understandably he had some trouble when he first discovered that the little bird 's beak he 'd been feeding all those years had been transformed overnight into a yapping adolescent mouth that could outtalk him , outreason him , and generally outsmarthim with the aid of " logic , " " analogy , " and assorted techniquesof condescension . But then came my four-year scholarship to Brown , and that crown of crowns , straight As in college , and gradually he too gave in and left off even trying to tell me what to think and do . By my seventeenth year it was already pretty clear that I did not mean to use my freedom from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , to his credit , he did the best an aggressive entrepreneur and indestructible breadwinner and loving father could , to let me be . Spielvogel would n't see it that way . He questioned my " fairly happy childhood , " suggesting that people could of course delude themselves about the good old days that had never been . There might be a harsher side to it all that I was conveniently forgetting  --  the threatening aspect of my mother 's competence and vigor and attentiveness , and the " castration anxiety , " as he called it , that it had fostered in her baby boy , the last , and emotionally the most fragile , of her offspring . From my descriptions of Morris 's life andp215my few vivid childhood recollections of him , Dr. Spielvogel concluded that my brother had been " constitutionally " a much tougher specimen than I to begin with , and that this biological endowmenthad been reinforced in his formative years when he had virtuallyto raise himself while my mother was off working most of each day in the store with my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess that as the ugly duckling and the girl in the family she had hardly been in danger of being overwhelmed by my mother 's attention ; to the contrary , she had probably felt herself at the periphery of the family circle , neglected and useless as compared with the hearty older brother and the clever younger one . If so ( he continued , writing his Tarnopol family history ) , it would not be surprising to find her in her forties still so avid to have  --  famous friends , modish beauty , exotic travels , fancy and expensive clothes : to have , in a word , the admiration and envy of the crowd . He shocked me by asking if my sister also took lovers with such avidity . " Joannie ? It never occurred to me . " " Much has n't , " the doctor assured the patient . Now I for one had never denied that my mother might have been less than perfect ; of course I remembered times when she seemed to have scolded me too severely or needlessly wounded my pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and done her share of thoughtless things while bringing me up , and at times , in anger or uncertainty , had like any parent taken the tyrannical way out . But not until I came under the influence of Dr. Spielvogel could I possibly have imagined a child any more valued or loved than Mrs. Tarnopol 's little boy . Any more , in fact , and I really would have been in trouble . My argument with this line the doctor began to take on my past was that if I had suffered anything seriousfrom having had a mother like my own , it was because she had nourished in me a boundless belief in my ability to win whatever I wanted , an optimism and innocence about my charmed life that ( now that I thought about it ) could very well have left me less than fortified against the realities of setback and frustration . Yes ,  |p216|perha|ps  what made me so pathetic at dealing with Maureen in her wildest moments was that I simply could not believe that anybody like her could exist in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't the repetition of an ancient " trauma " that rendered me so helpless with my defiant wife  --  it was its uniqueness . I might as well have been dealing with a Martian , for all the familiarity I had with female rage and resentment . I admitted readily to Dr. Spielvogel that of course I had been reducedin my marriage to a bewildered and defenseless little boy , but that , I contended , was because I had never been a bewildered little boy before . I did not see how we could account for my downfallin my late twenties without accounting simultaneously for all those years of success and good fortune that had preceded it . Was n't it possible that in my " case , " as I willingly called it , triumph and failure , conquest and defeat derived from an indestructibleboyish devotion to a woman as benefactress and celebrant , protectress and guide ? Could we not conjecture that what had made me so available to the Bad Older Woman was the reawakeningin me of that habit of obedience that had stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my childhood ? A small boy , yes , most assuredly , no question about it  --  but not at all , I insisted , because the protecting , attentive , and regulating mother of my fairly happy memories had been Spielvogel 's " phallic threateningmother figure " to whom I submitted out of fear and whom a part pf me secretly loathed . To be sure , whoever held absolute power over a child had inevitably to inspire hatred in him at times , but were n't we standing the relationship on its head by emphasizingher fearsome aspect , real as it may have been , over the lovingnessand tenderness of the mother who dominated the recollections of my first ten years ? And were n't we drastically exaggerating my submissiveness as well , when all available records seemed to indicatethat in fact I had been a striving , spirited little boy , nicknamed Peppy , who hardly behaved in the world like a whipped dog ? Children , I told Spielvogel ( who I assumed knew as much ) , hadp217undergone far worse torment than I ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hardly unusual , he said , to have felt loved by the " threatening mother " ; what was distressing was that at this late date I should continue to depict her in this " idealized " manner . That to him was a sign that I was still very much " under her spell , " unwilling so much as to utter a peep of protest for fear yet of reprisal . As he saw it , it was my vulnerability as a sensitive little child to the pain such a mother might so easily inflict that accounted for " the dominance of narcissism " as my " primary defense . " To protect myself against the " profound anxiety " engendered by my mother  --  by the possibilities of rejection and separation , as well as the helplessness that I experienced in her presence  --  I had cultivated a strong sense of superiority , with all the implications of " guilt " and " ambivalence " over being " special . " I argued that Dr. Spielvogel had it backwards . My sense of superiority  --  ifhe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense " against the threat of my mother , but rather my altogether willing acceptance of her estimation of me . I just agreed with her , that 's all . As what little boy would n't ? I was not pleading with Spielvogel to believe that I had ever in my life felt like an ordinary person or wished to be one ; I was only trying to explain that it did not require " profound anxiety " for my mother 's lastborn to come up with the idea that he was somebody to conjure with . Now , when I say that I " argued " or " admitted , " and Spielvogel " took issue , " etc. , I am drastically telescoping a dialectic that was hardly so neat and narrow , or so pointed , as it evolved from session to session . A summary like this tends to magnify considerably my own resistance to the archaeological reconstruction of my childhood that began to take shape over the first year or so of therapy , as well as to overdraw the subtle enough means by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my troubles . If I , in fact , had been less sophisticated about " resistance "  --  and he 'd had less expertise  --  I might actually have been able to resist him more successfully . ( On the basis of this paragraph , Dr. Spielvogelp218would undoubtedly say that my resistance , far from being overcomeby my " sophistication , has triumphed over all in the end . For why do I assign to him , rather than myself , the characterization of my mother as " a phallic threatening figure , " if not because I am still unwilling to be responsible for thinking such an unthinkable thought ? ) Also , had I been less desperate to be cured of whatever was ailing me , and ruining me , I probably could have held out somewhat longer  --  though being , as of old , the most willing of pupils , I would inevitably , I think , have seriously entertained his ideas just out of schoolboy habit . But as it was , because I so wanted to get a firm grip upon myself and to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got wind of Dr. Spielvogel 's bias , I became increasingly willing to challenge my original version of my fairly happy childhood with rather Dickensian recollections of my mother as an overwhelming and frightening person . Sure enough , memories began to turn up of cruelty , injustice , and of offenses against my innocence and integrity , and as time passed , it was as though the anger that I felt toward Maureen had risen over its banks and was beginning to rush out across the terrain of my childhood . If I would never wholly relinquish my benign version of our past , I nonetheless so absorbed Spielvogel 's that when , some ten months into analysis , I went up to Yonkers to have Passover dinner with my parents and Morris 's family , I found myself crudely abrupt and cold with my mother , a performance almost as bewildering afterward to me as to this woman who so looked forward to each infrequent visit that I made to her dinner table . Peeved , and not about to hide it , my brother took me aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey , what 's going on here tonight ? " I could not give him anything but a shrug for a reply . And try as I might , when I later kissed her goodbye at the door , I did not seem to have the wherewithal to feign even a little filial affection  --  as though my mother , who had been crestfallen the very first time she had laid eyes on Maureen , and afterward had put up with the fact of her solely to please me , was somehow an accomplice to Maureen 's vindictiverage.  |p219Somewhere  along in my second year of therapy , when relations with my mother were at their coolest , it occurred to me that rather than resenting Spielvogel , as I sometimes did , for provoking this perplexing change in behavior and attitude toward her , I should see it rather as a strategy , harsh perhaps but necessary , designed to deplete the fund of maternal veneration on which Maureen had been able to draw with such phenomenal results . To be sure , it was no fault of my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the abundance of her love to someone who was in actuality my enemy ; it could be taken , in fact , as a measure of just how gratifying a mother she had been , what a genius of a mother she had been , that a son of hers , decades later , had found himself unable to " wrong " a woman with whom his mother shared nothing except a common gender , and a woman whom actually he had come to despise . Nonetheless , if my future as a man required me to sever at long last the reverential bonds of childhood , then the brutal and bloody surgery on the emotions would have to proceed , and without blaming the physician in charge for whatever pain the operation might cause the blameless mother or for the disorientation it produced in the apron-strung idolatrous son . . . Thus did I try to rationalize the severity with which I was coming to judge my mother , and to justify and understand the rather patriarchal German-Jewish doctor , whose insistence on " the phallic threatening mother " I sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . But that suspicion was not one that I cared , or dared , to pursue . I was far too much the needy patient to presume to be my doctor 's doctor . I had to trust someone if I hoped ever to recover from my defeat , and I chose him . I had , of course , no real idea what kind of man Dr. Spielvogel was outside of his office , or even in the office with other patients . Where exactly he had been born , raised , and educated , when and under what circumstances he had emigrated to America , what his wife was like , whether he had children  --  I knew no more about these simple facts of his life than I did about the man whop220sold me my morning paper ; and I was too obedient to what I understood to be the rules of the game to ask , and too preoccupied with my own troubles to be anything more than sporadically curious about this stranger in whose presence I lay down on a couch in a dimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spoke as I had never spoken even to those who had proved themselves worthy of my trust . My attitude toward the doctor was very much like that of the first-grader who accepts on faith the wisdom , authority , and probity of his teacher , and is unable to grasp the idea that his teacher also lives in the ambiguous and uncertain world beyond the blackboard . I had myself been just such a youngster , and experienced my first glimpse of my doctor riding a Fifth Avenue bus with the same stunned disbelief and embarrassment that I had felt at age eight when , in the company of my sister , I had passed the window of a neighborhood barbershop one day and saw the man who taught " shop " in my school getting a shine and a shave . I was four months into my analysis on the drizzly morning when I looked up from the bus stop in front of Doubleday 's on Fifth Avenue and saw Spielvogel , in a rainhat and a raincoat , looking out from a seat near the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression on his face . Of course years before I had seen him in his yachting cap sipping a drink at a summer party , so I knew for a fact that he did not really cease to exist when he was not practicing psychoanalysison me ; I happened too to have been acquainted with severalyoung training analysts during my year of graduate work at Chicago , people with whom I 'd gotten along easily enough during evenings in the local student bar . But then Spielvogel was no casual beer-drinking acquaintance : he was the repository of my intimate history , he was to be the instrument of my psychic  --  my spiritual  --  recovery , and that a person entrusted with that responsibility should actually go out into the street and board a public vehicle such as carried the common herd from point A to point B  --  well , it was beyond my comprehension . How could I have been so stupidp221as to confide my darkest secrets to a person who went out in public and took a bus ? How could I ever have believed that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenseless beneath his olive-green rainhat , this unimpressive stranger on a bus , could possibly free me from my woes ? And just what in God 's name was I expected to do now  --  climb aboard , pay my fare , proceeddown the aisle , tap him on the shoulder , and say  --  say what ? " Good day , Dr. Spielvogel , it 's me  --  you remember , the man in his wife 's underwear . " I turned and walked rapidly away . When he saw me move off , the bus driver , who had been waiting patiently for me to rise from my reverie and enter the door he held open , called out , in a voice weary of ministering to the citizenry of Manhattan , " Another screwball , " and drove off , bearing through an orange light my shaman and savior , bound ( I later learned , incredulously ) for an appointment with his dentist . It was in September of 1964 , at the beginning of my third year of analysis , that I had a serious falling out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even after I decided to stay on , found it impossible to invest in him and the process anything like the belief and hope with which I had begun . I could never actually divest myself of the idea that I had been ill-used by him , though I knew that the worst thing I could do in my " condition " was nurse feelings of victimization and betrayal . Six months ago , when I left New York , it was largely because I was so disheartened and confounded by what Susan had done ; but also it was because my dispute with Dr. Spielvogel , which never really had been settled to my satisfaction , had become again a volatile issue between us  --  revived , to be sure , by Susan 's suicide attempt , which I had been fearing for years , but which Spielvogel had generally contended was a fear having more to do with my neurotic personality than with " reality . " That I should think thatp222Susan might try to kill herself if and when I should ever leave her , Spielvogel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explain my demoralization after the fear had been substantiatedby fact . " I am not a fortune-teller , " he said , " and neither are you . There was as much reason , if not more , to believe she would not do it as that she would . You know yourself  --  she knew herself  --  that this affairof yours was the most satisfying thing to happen to her in years . She had , literally , the time of her life . She began at last to become a full-grown woman . She bloomed , from all reports  --  correct ? If when you left her , she did not have enough support from her doctor , from her family , from wherever , well , that is unfortunate . But what can you do ? She did at least have what she had with you . And she could not have had it without you . To regret now having stayed with her all those years , because of this  --  well , that is not to look very carefully at the credit side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not commit suicide . You act here , you know , as though that is what has happened , as though there has been a funeral , and so on . But she only attempted suicide , after all . And , I would think , with little intention of succeeding . The fact is that her cleaning woman was to arrive early the very next morning , and that the woman had a key with which to let herself into Susan 's apartment . She knew then that she would be found in only a few hours . Correct ? Of course , Susan took something of a risk to get what she wanted , but as we see , she pulled it off quite well . She did not die . You did come running . And you are running yet . Maybe only in circles , but that for her is still better than out of her life completely . It is you , you see , who is blowing this up out of all proportion . Your narcissism again , if I may say so . Much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to use this incident , which has not ended so tragically , you know  --  to use this incident to break off therapy and go off into isolation again , once more the defeated man , well , I think you are making a serious mistake . " If so , I went ahead and made it . I could not continue to confidep223in him or to take myself seriously as his patient , and I left . The last of my attachments had been severed : no more Susan , no more Spielvogel , no more Maureen . No longer in the path of love , hate , or measured professional concern  --  by accident or design , for good or bad , I am not there . Note : A letter from Spielvogel arrived here at the Colony just this week , expressing thanks for the copies of " Salad Days " and " CourtingDisaster " that I mailed to him earlier in the month . I had written : For some time now I 've been debating whether to send on to you these two ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vermont . I do now , pot because I wish to open my case up to a renewed investigation in your office ( though I see how you might interpret these manuscripts in that way ) , but because of your interestin the processes of art ( and because lately you have been on my mind ) . I know that your familiarity with the biographical and psychological data that furnished the raw material for such flights of fancy might give rise to theoretical speculation , and the theoreticalspeculation give rise in turn to the itch to communicate your findings to your fellows . Your eminent colleague Ernst Kris has noted that " the psychology of artistic style is unwritten , " and my suspicion ( aroused by past experience ) is that you might be interested in taking a crack at it . Feel free to speculate all you want , of course , but please , nothing in ' print without my permission . Yes , that is still a sore subject , but not so sore ( I 've concluded ) as to outweigh this considered impulse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " unconscious " origins ( I must warn you ) may not be so unconscious as a professional might like to conclude at first glance . Yours , Peter Tarnopol . Spielvogel 's reply : It was thoughtful of you to send on to me your two new stories . I read them with great interest and enjoyment , and as ever , admirationp224for your skills and understanding . The two stories are so different and yet so expertly done , and to my mind balance each other perfectly . The scenes with Sharon in the first I found especially funny , and in the second the fastidious attention that the narrating voice pays to itself struck me as absolutely right , given his concerns ( or " human concerns " as the Zuckerman of " Salad Days " would have said in his undergraduate seminar ) . What a sad and painful story it is . Moral , too , in the best , most serious way . You appear to be doing very well . I wish you continued success with your work . Sincerely , Otto Spielvogel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if the letter is just a contrivance to woo me back onto his couch , what a lovely and clever contrivance ! I wonder whom he has been seeing about his prose style . Now why could n't he write about me like that ? ( Or was n't that piece he wrote about me really as bad as I thought ? Or was it even worse ? And did it matter either way ? Surely I know what it 's like having trouble writing up my case in English sentences . I 've been trying to do it now for years . Then , was ridding myself of him wrong too ? Or am I just succumbing  --  like a narcissist ! Oh , he knows his patient , this conjurer . . . Or am I being too suspicious ? ) So : shall I go ahead now and confuse myself further by sending copies of the stories to Susan ? to my mother and father ? to Dina Dornbusch ? to Maureen 's Group ? How about to Maureen herself ? Dear Departed : It may cheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how persuasive you were . Actually had you played your cards right and been just a little less nuts we 'd be miserably married yet . Even as it is , your widower thinks practically only of you . Do you think of him in Heaven , or ( as I fear ) have you set your sights on some big strapping neurotic angel ambivalent about his sexual role ? These two stories owe much to your sense of things  --  you might have conceived of the self-intoxicated princeling of " Salad Days " yourself and called him me ; and , allowing for artistic licensep225of course , is n't Lydia pretty much how you saw yourself ( if , that is , you could have seen yourself as you would have had others see you ) ? How is Eternity , by the way ? In the hope that these two stories help to pass the time a little more quickly , I am , your bereaved , Peter . Out of the whirlwind , a reply : Dear Peter : I 've read the stories and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . Your spiritual exertions ( in your own behalf ) are very touching . I took the liberty ( I did n't imagine you would mind ) of passing them on to the Lord . You will be pleased to know that " Courting Disaster " brought a smile to His lips as well . No wrath whatsoever , I 'm happy to report , though He did remark ( not without a touch of astonishment ) , " It is all vanity , is n't it ? " The stories are currently making the rounds of the saints , who I 'm sure will ' find your aspiration to their condition rather flattering . The rumor here among the holy martyrs is that you 've got a new work under way that you say is really going " to tell it like it is . " If so , I expect that means Maureen again . How do you intend to portrayme this time ? Holding your head on a plate ? I think a phallus would increase your sales . But of course you know best how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with My Martyrdom as a Man . That is to be the title , is it not ? All of us here in Heaven look forward to the amusement it is sure to afford those who know you from on high . Your beloved wife , Maureen . P.S. Eternity is fine . Just about long enough to forgive a son of a bitch like you . And now , class , will you please hand in your papers , and before turning to Dr. Spielvogel 's useful fiction , let us see what you have made of the legends here contrived : English 312M &F; 1:00  --  2:30 ( assignations by appointment ) Professor Tarnopolp226THE USES OF THE USEFUL FICTIONS : Or , Professor Tarnopol WithdrawsSomewhat from His Feelingsby Karen OakesCertainly I do not deny when I am reading that the author may be impassioned , nor even that he might have conceived the first plan of his work under the sway of passion . But his decision to write supposes that he withdraws somewhat from his feelings . . . .  --  Sartre , What Is Literature ? On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Simone de Beauvoir " Salad Days , " the shorter of the two Zuckerman stories assigned for today , attempts by means of comic irony to contrast the glories and triumphs of Nathan Zuckerman 's golden youth with the " misfortune " of his twenties , to which the author suddenly alludes in the closing lines . The author ( Professor Tarnopol ) does not elucidate in the story the details of that misfortune ; indeed , the point he makes is that , by him at least , it can not be done . " Unfortunately , the author of this story , having himself experienced a similar misfortune at about the same age , does not have it in him , even yet , midway through his thirties , to tell it briefly or to find it funny . Unfortunate , ' " concludes the fabricatedZuckerman , speaking in behalf of the dissembling Tarnopol , " because he wonders if that is n't more the measure of the man than of the misfortune . " In order to dilute the self-pity that ( as I understand it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unhappymarriage , Professor Tarnopol establishes at the outset here a tone of covert ( and , to some small degree , self-congratulatory ) selfmockery ; this calculated attitude of comic detachment he maintains right on down to the last paragraph , where abruptly the shield ofp227lightheartedness is all at once pierced by the author 's pronouncement that in his estimation the true story really is n't funny at all . All of which would appear to suggest that if Professor Tarnopol has managedin " Salad Days " to make an artful narrative of his misery , he has done so largely by refusing directly to confront it . In contrast to " Salad Days , " " Courting Disaster " is marked throughoutby a tone of sobriety and an air of deep concern ; here is all the heartfeltness that has been suppressed in " Salad Days . " A heroic quality adheres to the suffering of the major characters , and their lives are depicted as far too grave for comedy or satire . The author reports that he began this story intending that his hero should be tricked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bedevilingincident from Professor Tarnopol 's personal history could not be absorbed into this fictional artifice is not difficult to understand : the Nathan Zuckerman imagined in " Courting Disaster " requires no shotgun held to his head for him to find in the needs and sorrows of Lydia Ketterer the altar upon which to offer up the sacrifice of his manhood . It is not compromising circumstances , but ( in both senses ) the gravity of his character , that determines his moral career ; all the culpability is his . In " Courting Disaster , " then , Professor Tarnopol conceives of himself and Mrs. Tarnopol as characters in a struggle that , in its moral pathos , veers toward tragedy , rather than Gothic melodrama , or soap opera , or farce , which are the modes that generally obtain when Professor Tarnopol narrates the story of his marriage to me in bed . Likewise , Professor Tarnopol invents cruel misfortunes ( i.e. , Lydia 's incestuous father , her sadistic husband , her mean little aunts , the illiterate Moonie ) to validate and deepen Lydia 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this plenitude of heartache , supplying , as it were , " the objective correlative " for the emotions of shame , grief , and guilt that inform the narration . And that informed Professor Tarnopol 's marriage . To put the matter altogether directly : if Mrs. Tarnopol had been such a Lydia , if Professor Tarnopol had been such a Nathan , and if I , Karen Oakes , had been a Moonie of a stepdaughter instead of just the star pupil of my sex in English 312 that semester , then , then his subsequentundoing would have made a certain poetic sense.  |p228But  as it is , he is who he is , she is who she is , and I am simply myself , the girl who would not go with him to Italy . And there is no more poetry , or tragedy , or for that matter , comedy to it than that . Miss Oakes : As usual , A+ . Prose overly magisterial in spots , but you understand the stories ( and the author ) remarkably well for one of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a beautiful young girl from a nice family with a theoretical turn of mind and a weakness for the grand style and the weighty epigraph . I remember you as an entirely beguiling person . On my deathbed I shall hear you calling from your room , " Will you hang up the downstairsphone , please , Mom ? " That plain-spoken line spoke volumes to me too . Ka-reen , you were right not to run off to Italy with me . It would n't have been Moonie and Zuckerman , but it probably would n't have been any good . Still , you should know that whatever the " neurotic " reason , I was gone on you  --  let no man , lay or professional , say I was n't , or ascribe my " hangup " over you simply to my having transgressed the unwritten law against copulating with those sort-of forbidden daughters known as one 's students ( though I admit : asking Miss Oakes , from behind my desk , to clarify further for the other students some clever answer she 'd just given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knees in your room to play the supplicantbeneath your belly , was a delicious sensation ; cunnilingus aside , I do n't think teaching has ever been so exciting , before or since , or that I 've ever felt so tender or devoted to any class as I did to our English 312 . Perhaps the authorities should reconsider , from a strictly pedagogical point of view , the existing taboo , being mindful of the benefits that may accrue to the class whose teacher has taken one of its members as his secret love ; I 'll write the AAUP about this , in good scholarly fashion of course outlining for them the tradition , from Socrates to Abelard to me  --  nor will I fail to mention the thanks we three received from the authorities for having thrown ourselves so conscientiously into our work . To think , I recounted to you on our very first " date " what they did to Abelard  --  yet , here I am still stunned at how I got mutilated by the state of New York ) . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overbearing ! Memories of my behavior make me cringe . I told you about Isaac Babel and about my wifep229with the same veins popping . My insistence , my doggedness , and my tears . How it must have alarmed you to hear me sobbing over the phone  --  your esteemed professor ! If only I had taken it a little easier and suggested a couple of weeks together in northern Wisconsin , some lake somewhere , rather than forever in tragic Europe , who knows , you might have been willing to start off that way . You were brave enough  --  it 's just that I did n't have the wherewithal for a little at a time . At any rate , I have had enough Vivid Experience to last awhile , and am off in the bucolic woods writing my memoirs . Whether this will put the Vivid Experience to rest I do n't know . Perhaps what I 'll think when I 'm done is that these pages add up to Maureen 's final victory over Tarnopol the novelist , the culmination of my life as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all candor " does n't suggest that I 've withdrawn that much from my feelings . But then why the hell should I ? So maybe my animus is not wholly transformed  --  so maybe I am turning art into a chamberpot for hatred , as Flaubert says I should n't , into so much camouflage for self-vindication  --  so , if the other thing is what literature is , then this ai n't . Ka-reen , I know I taught the class otherwise , but so what ? I 'll try a character like Henry Miller , or someone out-and-out bilious like Celine for my hero instead of Gustave Flaubert  --  and wo n't be such an Olympian writer as it was my ambition to be back in the days when nothing called personal experience stood between me and aesthetic detachment . Maybe it 's time to revise my ideas about being an " artist , " or " artiste " as my adversary 's lawyer preferred to pronounce it . Maybe it ' as always time . Only one drawback : in that I am not a renegade bohemian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have taken me for that ) , I may not be well suited for the notoriety that attends the publication of an unabashed and unexpurgated history of one 's erotic endeavors . As the history itself will testify , I happen to be no more immune to shame or built for public exposure than the next burgher with shades on his bedroom windows and a latch on the bathroom door  --  indeed , maybe what the whole history signifies is that I am sensitive to nothing in all the world as I am to my moral reputation . Not that I like being fleeced of my hard-earned dough either . Maybe I ought just to call this confession " The Case Against Leeches , by One Who Was Bled , " and publish it as a political tract  --  go on Johnnyp230Carson and angrily shake an empty billfold at America , the least I can do for all those husbands who 've been robbed deaf , dumb , and blind by chorines and maureens in the courts of law . Inveigh with an upraised fist against " the system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ( the first ! ) trap life laid for me . Or ought I to deposit these pages too into my abounding liquor carton , and if I must embroil myself in the battle yet again , go at it like an artist worthy of the name , without myself as the " I , " without the bawling and the spleen , and whatever else unattractive that shows ? What do you think , shall I give this up and go back to Zuckermanizingmyself and Lydiafying Maureen and Moonieing over you ? If I do take the low road of candor ( and anger and so forth ) and publish what I 've got , will you ( or your family ) sue for invasion of privacy and defamation of character ? And if not you , wo n't Susan or her family ? Or will she go one better and , thoroughly humiliated , do herself in ? And how will I take it when my photograph appears on the Time magazine book page , captioned " Tarnopol : stripped to his panties and bra . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter in the Sunday Times book review section , signed by members of Maureen 's Group , challenging my malicious characterizationof Maureen as a pathological liar , calling me the liar and my book the fraud . How will I like it when the counterattack is launched by the opposition  --  will it strike me then that I have exorcised the past , or rather that now I have wed myself to it as irrevocably as ever I was wed to Maureen ? How will I like reading reviews of my privatelife in the Toledo Blade and the Sacramento Bee ? And what will Commentary make of this confession ? I ca n't imagine it 's good for the Jews . What about when the professional marital experts and authoritieson love settle in for a marathon discussion of my personality problems on the " David Susskind Show " ? Or is that just what I need to straighten me out ? Maybe the best treatment possible for my excessivevulnerability and preoccupation generally with My Good Name ( which is largely how I got myself into this fix to begin with ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fig ! ' t is in ourselves that we are thus or thus . " Sure , quote Iago to them  --  tell them , " Oh , find me self-addicted and self-deluded , find me self and nothing more ! Call me a crybaby , call me a misogynist , call me a murderer , see if Ip231care . ' T is only in ourselves that we are thus or thus  --  bra and panties notwithstanding . Your names 'll never harm me ! " Only they do , Ka-reen , the names drive me wild , and always have . So where am I ( to get back to literature ) : still too much " under the sway of passion " for Flaubertian transcendence , but too raw and touchy by far ( or just too ordinary , a citizen like any other ) to consider myselfequal to what might , in the long run , do my sense of shame the greatest good : a full-scale unbuttoning , a la Henry Miller or Jean Genet . . . Though frankly ( to use the adverb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is beginning to seem as imaginary as my Zuckermans anyway , or at least as detached from the memoirist  --  hisrevelations coming to seem like still another " useful fiction , " and not because I am telling lies . I am trying to keep to the facts . Maybe all I 'm saying is that words , being words , only approximate the real thing , and so no matter how close I come , I only come close . Or maybe I mean that as far as I can see there is no conquering or exorcising the past with words  --  words born either of imagination or forthrightness  --  as there seems to be ( for me ) no forgetting it . Maybe I am just learning what a past is . At any rate , all I can do with my story is tell it . And tell it . And tell it . And that 's the truth . And you , what do you do to pass the time ? And why do I care all of a sudden , and again ? Perhaps because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age at which I passed out of Eden into the real unreal world  --  or perhaps it 's just because I remember you being so uncrazy and so much your own person . Young , of course , but that to me made it all the more extraordinary . As did your face . Look , this sexual quarantine is not going to last forever , even I know that . So if you 're ever passing through Vermont , give me a call . Maureen is dead ( you might not have guessed from how I 've gone on here ) and another love affair ended recently with my friend ( the Susan mentioned above ) attempting to kill herself . So come on East and try your luck . See me . You always liked a little adventure . As did your esteemed professor of sublimation and high art , Peter T.My dispute with Spielvogel arose over an article he had written for the American Forum for Psychoanalytic Studies and published in a special number focusing on " The Riddle of Creativity . " I **29;1520;TOOLONG that chiseled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . And I think , Does John regret me ? Does he wish I were Carol 's type ? He did marry her , after all . I take down my hair and fold it under to see how it would look if I cut it . I stand sideways to the mirror and suck in my stomach . It is the days when I know I wo n't see him that I go through all this . I have nothing else to do . I file my nails or sew on a button , during Darcy 's nap I open library books that I ca n't pin my mind to or I leaf through magazines that I have already worn to tatters . When she wakes up , we go on long walks . I know this street now the way I know our room : every crumple in the sidewalk , every spindly tree , every turret and gable and leaded window of these endless dismal rowhouses . We take Mr. Somerset 's toast crusts and feed the pigeons . We go to the library , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and changing her mind and putting them away again . I never hurry her . What use is time now ? We have so much of it . When she has decided on her books we walk very slowly home and then I read them to her , over and over , until my mouth is dry and my throat aches from imitatingsqueaky mice and growly bears . Darcy nestles under my arm , following the pictures with her great blue eyes . She has started sucking her thumb again . Four and a half is too old for that , I tell her , but I never really try to stop her . I figure she might as well take her comfort from wherever she can . It was through Darcy that John first got to me . One morning I looked up and there the was , squatting to talk to her and asking her if she knew how pretty she looked . " You 've got your mother 's mouth , " he said . Most people see only Guy in her . " Bright , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook my hand . We had met a couple of times before , but this was the first notice that he had taken of Darcy . After that he spoke to her every time he came by , and often brought her something  --  a jump-rope , or a set of checkers , and once a little dress-upp61doll that had a lot of extra costumes they sold separately . He brought her those costumes one by one ; in the end I believe she had them all . And meanwhile , of course , he and I were getting to know each other . But Darcy was the starting point . I remember the first time I ever thought seriously about John . It was a few months after we had met . He said , " Now that you have this one pretty little girl , are you going to have a whole crowd more ? " " Oh , no , " I said , " Guy says one is plenty . " " He 's a fool , " John said , and he looked straight at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know why that stuck with me for so long . I remember that I went back to the house and started washing dishes , and suddenly I stopped with my hands in the suds and looked out the window after him and got this strange springing feeling in the bottom of my stomach . That was how it began . The man who owns this boarding house is very odd , and at first I was afraid of him . He reminded me of a slug . You see people like that in the.newspaper all the time , caught molestingchildren or exhibiting themselves on picnic grounds or shooting into crowds ; there is something curled and lifeless and out of touch about them . But when I had been here longer I saw that he would n't harm a fly , and now I let him talk with Darcy even when I am in another part of the house . You can tell he loves children . He does n't know what to say to them , really , but he tries hard and he often takes Darcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does her good to get away from me for a while . When I think he might be growing tired I climb the stairs to fetch her , and I find them bending over separate tables , Darcy chattering away a mile a minute and covered with paste while Mr. Pauling works silently on those kaleidoscope things he seems to like . " I 'll take her now , " I say , and he says , " Oh , well , oh , no hurry , we were just  --  she was just  --  " Then he stands there wringingp63his hands , the first person I ever saw who truly does wring his hands . He does n't appear to like me much , or maybe that 's just his manner . He makes me feel too tall and too loud and too strong . I never know how to act with him . Evenings , watching TV , which is the only time when we boarders are all together , he is so confused and some of what he says is so out of place  --  things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world  --  that I have to hold down a laugh . The others are very kind to him . They never laugh . They have a habit of bending their heads toward him as they listen , and then straightening to puzzle over what he says , and even if he makes no sense they give him some grave and courteous answer . Because of this all conversation moves slowly , with long pauses , in a sort of circle that is designed to protect him . No wonder the meek will inherit the earth . Darcy 's eyes are blue like Guy 's , and her hair is his fine , white-blond color and not much longer  --  Guy always did wear it long . I remember when I first saw him , he was swimming in Dewbridge Lake and every time he came up for air he had to give his head a sharp flick to get the hair off his face . Wet , it came nearly to his chin . When it snapped back spangles of water flew out from him like jewels . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diving board . Other people used it ; I was n't allowed to , for fear of stobs and hidden branches . I was n't allowed to do anything back then . I was fifteen , a nice quiet girl who did n't even wear lipstickyet , and I had come with my parents and we were sitting on an oilcloth with a picnic lunch that would feed an old folks ' home and great quantities of insect repellent and sunburnointment and wet cloths wrapped in cellophane in caseof spills . This boy with the long slick hair ( I did n't know his name then ) seemed to have brought nothing but himself , barely covered by one of those tight satin bathing suits thatp63I always thought were so tacky . He stood on the farthest limb that would bear his weight and then flung himself up and out , and he cut through the water like a knife and came up flicking that hair and laughing . I just stared . I thought he was fascinating . Now I am not talking about love at first sight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to death ! He and all his friends , with their horseplay and their great splashing butterfly strokes and the wolf howls they gave toward the girls out on the barrel raft . They did n't howl at me . I was just sitting there in the shade with my parents , watching out for sunburn , shrinking when any of them came too close . And when my mother said , " This lake would be right fine if it were n't for the rougher element , " I said , " Yes , ma'am , " and meant it . But that did n't stop me from staring at Guy Tell . My father was the principal of Partha Iligh School in Partha , Virginia . My mother was an English teacher . They were middle-aged when they had me and I was an only child , which may be why they guarded me so well  --  that and their being religious . They were Baptists . My father passed the collection plate on Sunday mornings . At one point I was religious too , and had thoughts of growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all passed away in time . I do n't know why . I just turned out not to be a believer , that 's all . But I continued to go to church with my parents . I sat folding my program into a fan , feeling chafed inside by some irritation that extended even to the starchy smell of my mother 's best dress and the way my father kept tugging his shirt cuffs down when he did n't need to . Yet I loved them . I was very close to them , especially to my mother . What bothered me was not my parents or even their way of living , but the fact that it seemed to be the only way open to me . I would grow up , of course , and go to college and marry and have children , but those were not changes so much asp64additions . I would still be traveling their single narrow life . There was no hope of any other . At least , not till Dewbridge Lake . Is Dewbridge Lake still there ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never been back . It 's as if the lake had fulfilled its purpose and then vanished from the face of the earth . Its mildewed gray pavilion was erected overnightfor me to do the bunnyhop in with my girlfriends , the only dance I was allowed . Its rainbow-colored jukebox was expressly filled with Pat Boone songs so that one day , at the end of a bunnyhop , Guy Tell might step up to me and say , " This here is for me and you to dance to , honey , " and fold me up in a long walking clinch because I was too scared to say no . That pine forest with its shiny hot floor was grown for the two of us to hide in , leaning against a spruce trunk , Guy perpetually sliding a swimsuit strap off my shoulder while I perpetually slid it back up . His kisses tasted of tobacco . I had never been kissed before and found it tiring ; my neck ached and my mouth felt bruised . Drawing back from me , he would smile with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was the loser , and I did n't even know I was in a contest . Then we would separate and I would return to my parents , leaving the pine trees shimmering behind me . Now I imagine that the entire forest has fallen , giving off no sound , like that tree they always bring up in science classes . All that will remain of it is a little golden dust floating upward in the sunlight . Yet there is a thirty-nine-cent strawberry-flavored lipstick in the dimestore whose smell can still , to this day , carry me back to the ladies ' changing rooms at Dewbridge Lake . Hot pine needles will always make me feel pleasantly endangered and out of my depth . The trashy taste of orange Nehi fills me even now with a longing to break loose , to go to foreign places , to try some adventure undreamed of by my father in his baggy plaid trunks and my mother in her blackp65rayon bathing suit with the pleated skirt . Oh , I would do it all over again , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would continue to glide across that splintery dance floor with Guy Tell 's hand clamping the back of my neck . He was twenty-two  --  older than anyone will ever seem to me again . I would n't be sixteen till December . ( Sixteen was the age my parents were going to let me start dating . And even then , of course , only boys my own age . Only boys from good families . Only in groups . ) All that fall , when the Dewbridge Lake Pavilion was boarded over and school had reopened , I continued to see Guy without anybody 's knowing . I said I was going to the library , or to visit a friend . Then I stood on a corner of Main Street and waited for Guy to come pick me up in a towtruck , and while he was pumping gas I would sit inside the filling station reading his racing magazines . He worked evenings . Daytimes he was free . Afternoons , as I was walking home from school , he slid up alongside me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore me off to a country road at the edge of town . While we were continuing our contest  --  he undoing a blouse button , I doing it up again  --  I felt lost and uncertain and longed to be safe at home , but once he was gone I forgot the feeling and wanted him back . I remembered the things that touched me : the intent look he wore when I told him anything ; his habit of remembering every anniversary of our meeting , weekly , monthly , with some small clumsy gift like a gilt compact or a cross on a chain ; the swashbuckling way he dressed and the eagle tattooed on his forearm and the dogtags always warm against his chest . Sitting in church on Sunday morning I called up his kisses , which from this safe distance filled me with a dizzy breathlessness that I thought might possibly be love . My mother sat beside me , nodding radiantly at the reading from Job . My father extended the long arm of his collection plate down the pews . I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already broken free . I thought , Why are n't they taking better care of me ? On December seventh I turned sixteen . My mother said , " Well , now I suppose you can go out some , Mary . " " Yes , ma'am , " I said . I went to Main Street to wait for Guy , and he brought me a charm bracelet hung with little plastic records to remind me of our first dance . Then he said , " I reckon we could get married now if you want . Do n't look like I am going to get over you any time soon . " So ten days later we eloped . I kept expecting my parents to follow me and take me back , but they did n't . I had to send them a telegram announcingI was married . And in the motel room , when I cried , Guy said , " Now do n't take on so , you 're tearing me up . You want just for tonight I should sleep in the other bed ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Well , what , then ? " Why I was crying was that here I sat , married , and I had never even had a real date . But it did n't seem the kind of thing that I could tell him . Last week I took out a post office box and then wrote Guy and asked for a divorce . The box was John 's idea . " You do n't want him coming after you , " he said , " tracking you down to your boarding house and making a scene . " He went with me to the post office , and afterwards we took Darcy to the Children 's Zoo . It was the nicest day I had had in a long time . Darcy played in the sand while John and I sat on a bench nearby in the sunlight , talking over our plans . John said that someone had seen us together in a restaurant and told his wife . " I believe it 's made her jealous , " he said . " You know how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . ) " She wants to have her cake and keep another piece waiting in the tin . As soon as she heard she came right over to the house all dressed up , sweet as sugar , asking questions . "  | " There 's no law against your taking someone out to supper , " I said . " That 's what I told her . " " She goes out with other people . All the time , you said . " " Let 's not talk about her , shall we ? " he said . " It 's too nice a day . " I feel that way when he talks about Guy , too . I do n't like seeing Guy through someone else 's eyes . Then his leather jacket and tooled boots start seeming ridiculous , and I am aware how his grammar must sound to outsiders and I feel hurt for him and protective . It 's me that 's being insulted as well  --  six years of my life are tied up with Guy . I changed the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera ? " " I 'm planning to take some pictures of Darcy . " On the days when John ca n't visit I start hating him , even though I know it 's not his fault ; but when I see him again he does something like this , thinking up an outing and photographingDarcy , and then I remember why I came away with him in the first place . Guy would never do anything like that . Oh , Guy took her picture , of course  --  with a camera he got for trading off some motorcycle parts  --  but he always wanted her dressed up first in those pink organdy frills he liked and he would arrange her hair in artificial-looking curls and seat her on the best piece of furniture . He called her his princess . His doll baby . Darcy is no doll baby . She thinks about everything  --  Isee her thinking  --  and if there is a mess around she will get into it and she is never still for a second . I do n't believeGuy even knew all that about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when his friends came by and he would show her off like a souped-up car , setting her someplace high and prinking out her skirt just so . " Ai n't she a doll baby ? You ever seen anything cuter ? " Now John goes down on his knees in the sand , fixing his lens on Darcy , who is sugared overp68with sand like a doughnut , one of her playsuit straps dangling into a bucket . " Keep still , " I tell her , but he says , " No , no , let her be . " He holds up a light meter , fiddles with mysterious buttons . By profession he is a photographer . He owns a small studio that is still just getting off the ground , which is why it takes so much of his time . Before studying photography he went to college . He is calm and well-ordered and he considersevery question from all sides . As far removed from Guy as a man can get . What would have happened if I 'd met John before Guy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had just become interested in them . He ran into Guy at some rally outside Baltimore and the following week he came all the way to Partha , looking to see what Guy had in stock . I should explain that by then Guy was managing the filling station , but he had more or less branched out into motorcycles . We lived on the first floor of the house next door , and between the house and the station was a shed that Guy kept filled with spare parts and any used bikes his friends were trying to sell or trade . When John came by I was out in the yard hanging clothes . " Like you to meet a friend of mine , " Guy said . " John Harris . He 's thinking of buying him a cycle . " Thinking isright . He was the most well-thought-out man I 'd ever seen . For four solid weeks he tested different models , read up on them , asked questions , went off to different dealers , returned to Guy to see if he had anything new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Guy at all , but some man in Baltimore . By then he and Guy were friends , though . Not what you would call close friends ; motorcycles were all they had in common . But they did do a lot of trail-biking together , and sometimesGuy would bring John home with him after a rally . Guy would come in all excited , blaming some fool who 'd run him off the road , cursing some flaw in his bike ( which he had bought in two minutes flat , on impulse , with money he didn'tp69have ) . He would yank the cap off a beer and chug-a-lug it , stomping around the kitchen . And meanwhile there stood John in the doorway , remarking on how nice my kitchen smelled and searching through his pockets for Darcy 's present . Dressed like someone in a sports magazine , in slacks and a polo shirt . Now do you see why I say he was so far removed from Guy ? It 's as if I have to keep trying different lives out , cheating on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd had six years of Hot Rod magazine and now I was ready to move on to something new . I picture tossing my life like a set of dice , gambling it , wasting it . I have always enjoyed throwing things away . Darcy said , " Hurry , John , I got to go to the toilet , " and John laughed and snapped the picture . Then he rose , brushing off his knees , and I took Darcy to the restroom . There was sand in her scalp ; I could look down and see it , glinting under the white of her hair . " When I come out , " she said , " I 'm going to ride the merry-go-round . Can I ? " I said , " All right , baby . " I looked back at John . He was smiling after us , turning some knob on the camera that he knew so well he did n't even have to look at it . " Come on , Mom , " Darcy said , and she reached up and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandy , and she smelled like sunshine , and she let me bend down and press my face against her hair for exactly one second before she freed herself and danced off again . Motherhood is what I was made for , and pregnancy is my natural state . I believe that . All the time I was carrying Darcy I was happier than I had ever been before , and I felt better . And looked better . At least , to myself I did . I do n't think Guy agreed . He was funny about things like that . He did n't want to feel the baby kick , would n't even touch me the last few months , acted surprised whenever I wanted to go out shoppingp70or to a movie . " Wo n't it bother you , people staring ? " he asked . " Why would it bother me ? " I said . " Why would they stare ? " He was the one that was bothered . He did n't even want to come with me to the labor room the night she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had thawed out some since I got pregnant . She stayed with me all through the pains , talking and keeping my spirits up , but most of my mind was on Guy . I thought , Would n't you think he could go through this with me ? He 'll worry more , surely , out there in the waiting room not knowing . The doctor had been upset about my age . He had told Guy I was still growing , much too young to have a baby of my own . What if I died ? Should n't Guy be there holding my hand ? But no  --  " I 'm scared I might pass out or something , " he said , and laughed , with his face sharp and white . Then he whispered , " I 'm scared the pain will make you angry for what I done to you . " " Oh , but Guy  --  " I said . Then my mother said , " Never mind , honey , Mama 's here . " She sat by my bed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read aloud from yesterday 's newspaper  --  any old thing she came across , it did n't matter , none of it made sense to me anyway . When it came time to wheel me into the delivery room she said , " I 'll be right here praying , honey , everything 's going to be fine , " but I saw that she was worried . I suppose she had taken to heart what the doctor said . Well , doctors do n't know everything they claim to . Having that baby was the easiest thing I ever did . I was meant to have babies . Age has nothing to do with it . When I think back on it  --  on my mother reading to me from that newspaper , smoothing the hair off my forehead  --  it seems that starting right there I began to live in a world made up of women . My mother and Guy 's , the neighbor women who gave me their old baby furniture and their bits of advice  --  women formed a circle that I sank into . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . The menp71draw back and the women close in . I thought that things would be different once I got Darcy settled in at home , but then Guy just kept to himself more than ever  --  acted scared of holding her , could n't stand to hear her cry , would n't help to name her . " Well , I do n't know , " he said . " Guyette ? That would be kind of cute . But , no , I reckon  --  I do n't know . You name her , you 're the one that knows . " I named her Darcy , my maiden name . I tried setting her on a pillow in Guy 's lap , with cushions all around so that he would n't worry about dropping her . When she cried I said , " Now , all that 's wrong is she 's hungry , Guy . I 'll feed her ; then you 'll see . " But mealtimewas another thing he could n't stand . I was breast-feeding ; he said it gave him a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . " Other people use bottles , " he told me . " Why go back to this way , now that they 've invented something better ? " When I got worn out with her nighttime feedings he said , " Switch her to Evenflo . Leave her with Mom and you and me will borrow some money and take a little trip somewheres . You need a rest . " I was touchy back then , tired from all those wakeful nights and worried that I might not have enough milk . " The biggest rest , " I said , " would be for you to just shut up and leave me be , Guy Tell , " and then I cried and the baby cried and Gloria came in and shooed Guy out of the house and put me to bed . Gloria was Guy 's mother , whom we 'd been living with ever since we were married . A peroxide blonde forever in shorts and a halter . Her husband had died long ago , I forget just how , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing a bottle of Southern Comfort that they would polish off in one evening over the kitchen table . I know that sounds depressing . See it on a TV screen and it would be depressing , but the fact is that Gloria was just wonderful to me and I loved her like a mother . I hate to think what I would have done without her . Before the baby , when Guy had switched top72working days and I had nothing to do with myself ( there was a rule against married students at school ) , Gloria was the only reason I did n't go out of my mind with boredom . She talked non-stop , took me shopping , fixed my hair a dozen ways , brought me up to date on all the soap operas we watched and lent me her confession magazines . Why , I was never even allowed to watch soap operas , and the most I 'd read of confessionmagazines was the covers , surreptitiously , while speeding past the newsstand with my mother . And after the baby ! I 'm ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't interfere , she never tried to take over , but whenever I was feeling lost and too young she was right there handing me hot milk and talking on and on in that airy , fake-tough way she had , appearing not to notice anything was wrong but soothing me all the same . Could a man do that ? No man that I know of . I cried when we moved into the house by the station . By then I had no mother of my own any more . I lost both parents when Darcy was still a baby , within six months of each other : heart attacks . I felt as if Gloria was my only strength , and here I was leaving her . " My Lord , honey , " Guy said , " most women would be tickled pink to get into a place of their own . " He said , " It 's me should be crying , it 's my mama after all . " And finally , " Do n't you want to live alone with me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . But even so , I missed Gloria . I went on seeing her nearly every day , right up to the time I came to Baltimore . And sometimes even now I think back on how it was when I was pregnant , still someone 's child instead of someone 's mother , peacefully floating through those empty days with Gloria . I remember the books that Guy used to bring me ; he liked to tell his friends he had married a brain , and almostdaily he brought me a paperback from the drugstore . Sleazy romance novels , beautiful heroines in anguish . I loved them . I close my eyes and see myself on the plastic sofa with ap73book on my stomach , Gloria beside me snapping her gum , great swells of organ music rising from the television . What does Gloria think of me now ? Has she cut me out of her mind , now that I have left her son with no more than a note on the refrigerator door ? If things do n't work out with John , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have really thought about that . I left in such a rush , whipping off my apron , hanging my wedding ring on a cup hook , giving not a backward glance to my Corning ware and my potted plants . I seemed to be drunk with the joy of doing something so illogical . Now I have hours and days and weeks to think : I am entirely dependent on a man I hardly know . I have no money , no home , no family to return to , not even a high school degree to get a job with , and no place to leave Darcy if I could find a job . I do n't even know if I am eligible for welfare . What if John stopped loving me ? Or if his wife came back  --  came walking in with her model 's slouch , a mink stole draped over her shoulder . ( Well , not in June , but that 's the way I picture her . ) I would be lost , then . I would be absolutely helpless , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : if it works out that John and I are married , I am going to save money of my own no matter what . I do n't care if I have to steal it ; I will save that money and hide it away somewhere in case I ever have to be on my own again . Only I wo n't be on my own , not if it 's up to me . I wo n't leave anyone else ever . It 's too hard . I never bargained for this tearing feeling inside me . I did n't know I would be so confused , as if I were in several places at once and yet not wholly any place at all . I had n't ever considered Darcy : how bewilderedshe would be or how her food and shelter would becomea problem . You would think that much would occur top74me . Why , Darcy is the center of my life ! And her hair is Guy 's , and her eyes ; I 'll be carrying pieces of Guy around forever . There was no point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am looking straight at John , even crossing to where he stands in the sunlight with his camera slung over his shoulder , smiling at Darcy and me so steadily : I love you , John , but if I were smarter I would have stayed with Guy . I check the mailbox every day but nothing comes from Guy . I keep trying to imagine what a letter from Guy would look like . He has never written me before . Never had to . If ever he needed to write to someone else  --  say a business letter , or something  --  he would ask me to do it for him , and his dictationwas full of et ceteras and , " Oh , you know , just put it like you think best . " He was n't too well educated . I would sit there with my ballpoint pen , waiting for Guy to think up a line , wondering what my mother would have said if she could see me . I was supposed to be unusually intelligent . Now look : " Dear Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adver-tised in the February issue of ... " I wonder if maybe he is never planning to write at all . If heis dead , or has left home himself , or is so angry he plans todrive to Baltimore and wait in person beside my post office box until I come looking for letters . The minute I enter the building every day , my eyes fly to the corner where my box is . No Guy . No letter . 1 take Darcy by the hand and turn away , feeling relieved , but meanwhile there are all these unusedwords backed up in my throat : " Oh Guy , I wish you had n't come . I wo n't go back with you no matter what , you 're only wasting your ... " It 's true I would n't go back . It just is n't in me . Even if it does n't work out with John , even if there is nowhere else to turn . I ca n't explain why . After all , what did Guy ever do top75me ? He worked hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I stopped loving him . I do n't know which takes more courage : surviving a lifelong endurance test because you once made a promise or breaking free , disrupting all your world . There are arguments for both sides ; I see that . But I made my choice . " Come away with me , " John said . " We love each other , why waste your life ? Where is your spirit of adventure ? " The first time he said it , he took my breath away with shock . The second time it seemed more possible . He planted a thought in me that grew when he was not around , so that when he stayed away a whole week and then returned I was praying for him to ask me again . It looked as if he might have forgotten . He played all morning with Darcy , did n't give me a glance . When lunchtime arrived he stood up , still not looking at me , not even touching my hand . " Are you coming ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darcy quiet a while I gave her some blunt-nosed scissors and a magazine . I sat on the bed beside her , crosslegged . I pretended that we were in a house that John had built for us , and he was off at work but would be coming home shortly for supper . I even planned what I would cook for him . I love to cook . Lately we have been living on things from cans , heated in Mr. Pauling 's miserable kitchen , and I am starved for the smell of herbs and baking bread . I planned the meal by smells alone : hot dilled biscuits , roast beef , a fresh green salad . John would open the door and the smells would curl around him and draw him in . We would sit down at a table with a white linen cloth , in a house that was stable , calm , warm , clean , built to shelter us a lifetime . It would never even occur to me to run away again . I cut out squares of paper to make Darcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . I cut an ovalp76rug and gave it to her to color , and then we made curtains from a flowered shopping bag . Darcy bent over them with her tongue between her teeth , concentrating . The back of her neck was like a little curved stem , and I kept wanting to reach out and touch it but I did n't . You hear a lot about teenaged wives , how they 're bound to fail , but nobody mentions teenaged mothers . They are the best in the world ; I 'm convinced of that . While the neighbor women were nagging their children not to get the house dirty , I was down on the floor playing with mine . I carried her piggyback wherever I went ; I dressed up in old clothes with her , read her my favorite storybooks , fixed tea for her dolls . Insteadof shipping her off to nursery school I had other children come visit , and sometimes I felt as if I were running a nursery school myself . Six and seven children would stampede through the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On rainy days we made picnic lunches and ate them on the dining room floor . Gloria said , " Honey , you spoil that child . She wo n't know how to amuse herself when her brothers and sisters start coming along . " I never told her about Guy 's not wanting more children . I kept hoping he would change his mind . But he said , " Ai n't this one taking all your time as it is ? What you want to go and ruin your figure for ? " He said that every time I brought it up . He never changed . I would stand in front of the mirror and see how widehippedand expansive I was , how tall I loomed , bigger than life , full of life , with not enough people to pour it into . My world had turned out narrow after all  --  different from my parents ' , but just as narrow . I looked out the front window and watched the people walking by , and I wanted to climb into every single one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence . I pictured myself descending from the sky , all wheeling arms and legs , to sink invisibly into their headsp77and ride home with them , to see how they arranged their furniture and who their friends were , what they fought about , what made them cry , where they went for fun and what they ate for breakfast and how they got to sleep at night and what they dreamed of . And having found out , I would leave ; on to the next one . I wanted to marry a mad genius and then a lumberman and then somebody very rich and cold and then a poet who would dedicate his every word to me and who would have a nervous breakdown when I left him . Which I would do , of course . As soon as I had been absorbed into his world , as soon as it stopped feeling foreign ; on to the next one . I did n't guess back then that moving on would hurt so . What would Guy have said if he 'd known what I dreamed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Saturday night . His greatest joy was attending motorcycle rallies . Hours and hours in someone 's hot cow pasture , with me trying to pick out the cloud of dust that was Guy from among a lot of other clouds . When I refused to go any more , he went alone . He was gone overnight , weekends . " That son of mine should stay at home more , " Gloria used to say , but I did n't mind . It seemed to be part of the pattern that I had married into ; the other women 's husbands did n't stay home either . They were off bowling , or drag-racing , or playing billiards . On summer evenings we would pool all our children and go to Roy 's for hamburgers , which we ate at one of the outdoor tables  --  a double line of women and children , not a man among us . All the women laughing and scolding and mopping spilled drinks , filling every corner of their world . Then when Guy came home again his boots jarred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he plucked Darcy out from her dolls she squirmed and looked at me for reassurance , as if he were a stranger . Which he had been , once upon a time . He was more ap78stranger than any boy I 'd met . It was n't his fault that we finally got to know each other . I walked with Darcy to the post office and we dawdled every step of the way . I was hanging back , hunting up excuses never to arrive at all . And when we got there , sure enough , a slanted blade of paper was showing through the window . One of my own envelopes , pale blue . It gave me a shock to see it . " Now can we go to the park ? " Darcy asked . " No , wait , " I told her . We were supposed to meet John there at noon . I did n't want him to watch me reading this letter . I leaned against a counter and tore open the envelope . The letter itself was written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept for Darcy to draw on . Every word was smudged over . Guy is left-handed ; his hand rubs what he has just written as it travels across the paper . I could picture him at the kitchen table with his hair falling over his forehead , his shoulders hunched with the effort of writing . Dear Mary , Now I have never understood you but this time is worse than usual . I treated you real good Mary always gave you ever little thing you wanted , a house of your own clothes a baby even when I thought we should wait some . I thought you was happy , now I hear it was n't so . Come home one night to find it wrote out on the icebox door , your going and wo n't be back and sorry you hurt me . You did n't hurt me worth a shit Mary I mean that . You could go clear on to California it would n't hurt me worth a shit . I am too blasted mad . We have been married six years now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast cars instead of cookpots and I could have had me a lot of other womenp79as well let me tell you but never did as I thought you loved me . I stood for a lot from you Mary . First off I near about raised you , you did n't know beans when we were married and had my mama waiting on you hand and foot for years , secondly I let you correct my grammer and my table manners and change my whole way of doing things that you looked down on and drive off all my friends account of you thought none of them was good enough for you . Did you ever invite a one of my buddies to dinner , no . When your mama died you acted like it was my fault it happened to her , also that time your cousin came from Washington you did n't even introduceme but went and ate supper at her motel leaving me a tuna fish sandwich . Well I could take all that , what I could n't take was this , you held my own baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and you raised her like your mother would do and never even let me hold her without fifteen pillows nor feed her nor have any good times with her , you and her just lived your seperate lives like I was n't around . You froze me out . Do n't you think I got feelings too ? What do you think I been thinking all these years ? Oh I do n't count I 'm just a man . You put me in mind of a black widow spider , soon as you got your child then a man is n't no more use to you . For years I been living a lonely life hoping you would change and you never did . NO you ca n't have a divorce . What is it you already met a man that wants zo children ? You ca n't have a divorce as long as you live and do n't try coming back or I 'll kill you , I mean it , I 'll kill you and Darcy both of you do n't neither one mean a thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gone . Sincerely , Guyp80I put the letter back in the envelope and slipped it into my purse . I took Darcy by the hand . She said , " Mom , can I buy a popsicle ? " " Maybe later , baby , " I said . I led her down the steps , out into the sunshine that was baking the sidewalk , but inside I felt cold and hard and dark like a stone . I looked into a store window and saw my reflection and thought , There goes a black widow spider taking her daughter to the park . The whole world looked different . A different set of colors even , and bigger and flatter . When we got to the park I saw John on a bench and he seemed to have changed too . He wore a black suit with a white shirt ; he was all black and white . The grass behind him was such a washed-out shade of green that I hardly recognized it . Some kind of cold white gauze was laid across everything . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I told him . I reached out to touch his sleeve . I thought , You are my only support . I am certain I love you . Certainly with you I wo n't fail . " Race you to that tree , " John told Darcy , and they were off like two jittery birds . I was the only still thing in the landscape . I stood clutching my purse to my stomach , stone still . Yet when the two of them had touched base and returned to me , and John said , " Shall 1 take you out to eat ? " I was able to smile the same as ever . I said , " That would be nice . " We went to a delicatessen where he said they made wonderfulsandwiches . It was cafeteria-style  --  a dangerous place to take Darcy . She always thinks she wants everything she sees . When we reached the cash register her tray was overflowing , and the lady who rang it up said , " Somebody 's eyes are bigger than their stomach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say if I grabbed both her hands and begged to go home with her ? Once we were seated John started acting nervous , tearing bits of bread off his sandwich and rolling them into balls . I wondered if he had noticed something odd about me . I wouldp81have to tell him sometime . I leaned forward and said , " I got an answer to that letter today . " John said , " You did ? " " He wo n't give me a divorce . " John smiled , with the corners of his mouth turned down . " It seems we 're beset with troubles from all sides , " he said . " All sides ? " " Carol has moved back into the house . " I looked over at Darcy . She was separating her sandwich to get at the mayonnaise . I wanted to tell her not to waste a bite of it , eat all she could hold , take the rest home in a doggy bag ; now we were going to starve . John said , " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll tire of it soon enough . I could n't just throw her out of the house , could I ? " " You could move out yourself , " I said . " Well , yes . Yes . In fact I will , but my studio is there . I ca n't just up and leave my studio . What I 'm counting on is her changing her mind , by and by . I 'm certain she 'll leave again . " How can you be sure ? " I asked him . " She operates on whims , Mary . She goes through fads . She 'll get over it . Right now she 's taken with the idea of being a homebody again . Says she wants to settle down , have children , grow vegetables . For Carol that 's ludicrous , I told her straight  --  " " Children ? " I said . " You got as far as talking about chil-dren ? " " Carol did , I said . " " You said she could n't have any children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about going to a doctor for some tests . Wants me to get tested too . " " What would they test you for ? " " To see if it 's me that ca n't have them . " " That 's ridiculous , " I said . " It 's hardly ever the man . "  | " Fifty per cent of the time it is . " I stared at him . " Why , sure , " he said . " I did n't know that . " " Well , I 'm not going , do n't worry , " he told me . He laid his hand over mine . " You 'll see , in a week she 'll move out again . " " But  --  what about now ? I mean , how are you arranging it ? Where is she sleeping ? " " Mary . Look . There 's nothing to get upset about . I 'm here with you eating lunch , are n't I ? I wo n't let you down . Whateverhappens , I think of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I 've been through a lot for your sake , Mary . I 'm jeopardizingmy divorce , I 've given up motorcycle rallies  --  " " Well ! Are you sure I 'm worth the sacrifice ? " " Be reasonable , will you ? " Reasonableness was why I left with him . He was so reasonableand cool ; life with him would be so different . I said , " Tell me something . Why did you ask me to come away with you ? " " Now , Mary  --  " " No , I mean it . Why did n't you wait till you were divorced , if you were so reasonable ? " " Well , you know why . I said we might wait and you said no , we 'd better do it now or not at all . You did n't even stop to pack a bag . Once you 'd made up your mind you wanted to get going , you said . You were n't the kind to  --  " " Oh , never mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear what kind I was . I did n't want to learn any more , ever , about how I appeared in other people 's eyes . We took Darcy back to the boarding house because she was cross and sleepy . After I put her to bed we came out and sat in the parlor  --  I in an easy chair , John perched on its arm . He kept stroking the inside of my wrist . " Do n't , " I told him.  | " This is n't like you , Mary , " he said . " It is n't like me to go out with someone whose wife is waiting at home either . " " In time , " he said , " this will all be over . It will seem like nothing . You 'll look back on it and laugh . " " Well , it may be over someday , and it might seem like nothing , " I told him , " but I will never look back on it and laugh . I do n't feel as if I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and saw the boredom and irritation drawn across it like a curtain , removed as soon as he found my eyes on him . His mouth was tugged permanently downward by two acid lines at the corners ; that much of his expression he could not remove . Think , I told myself , of the clean cut of him , the precision , the logic and decisiveness . Is n't that why you 're here with him ? His forefinger chafed my wrist like sandpaper , as if my skin were peeled back and he were stroking raw nerves . I stood up suddenly , pretending to have heard some sound from Darcy , and I went into the bedroom . Darcy was fast asleep . She lay sprawled across our bed , her mouth slightly open , her hairline damp with sweat . I heard John come up behind me and I felt his hand on my hip . " She 's asleep , " he told me . " She 's tired out . " " We 're all alone , " he said . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up in his studio . " " Come with me to the couch . " " Are you crazy ? " I moved his hand away but he stayed close behind me . " What do we care about Mr. Pauling ? " he said . " You 're crazy , " I told him . " I wish you would leave now . Will you go on home to your wife , please ? " " Suit yourself , " he said . He stood there a moment longer but I would n't even turn to look at him . I wanted him gone . I wanted to pick Darcyp84up and sit with her in a rocking chair , just the two of us , shut away from everyone . Yet when he did go ( stepping too lightly , as if I were asleep as well ) , I was angry at him for leaving . I felt abandoned as soon as I heard the front door shut . I sat down on the bed ; I took one of Darcy 's stockinged feet and held it tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming down my face . A long time later Mr. Pauling came by with a carpet sweeper and a dirty gray dust rag . I heard the sweeper 's wheels roll through my doorway and then stop short . " Oh , " Mr. Pauling said , " I 'm sorry , I thought  --  " " That 's all right . " " I thought you were still  --  but I 'll come back another  --  " " No , please . Go right ahead . Do n't let me stop you . " I stood up , digging in my pocket for a handkerchief . Mr. Pauling remained in the doorway . When I sidled past him I could smell the Ivory soap on his white , white skin . I kept my eyes down , hiding the tears , so that all I saw of him was his pale plump chest above a fishnet undershirt . " Please , is there anything at all I could do to help ? " he asked me . That one single piece of kindness shattered me . " Oh , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step closer and bent to lay my face upon his shoulder . I do n't know why . I felt the shock hit him  --  a short breath inward , the handle of the sweeper clanging against the door and then dropping to the carpet with a thud . He kept both his arms behind him , like someoneunder surprise attack . Already I was sorry I had scared him so . I thought , Good Lord , I wonder what I will take into my head to do next . I had started trying to smile , to be ready to draw back and face him and apologize , when I felt one of his hands rise up and pat my arm . Little soft pats with the fingers tight together . Little warm breaths stirring a wisp of my hair . " Oh there , oh please , " he said , " please do n't cry ,  |p85Mrs  . Tell . " I shifted my face into the crook of his neck . I put my arms around his waist , which felt soft and had too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you cry , " he said . His voice wavered , as if he might start crying himself . Sad people are the only real ones . They can tell you the truth about things ; they have always known that there is no one you can depend upon forever and no change in your life , however great , that can keep you from being in the end what you were in the beginning : lost and lonely , sitting on an oilcloth watching the rest of the world do the butterfly stroke.  |p86These  are some of the things that Jeremy Pauling dreaded : using the telephone , answering the doorbell , opening mail , leaving his house , making purchases . Also wearing new clothes , standing in open spaces , meeting the eyes of a stranger , eating in the presence of others , turning on electrical appliances . Some days he woke to find the weather sunny and his health adequate and his work progressing beautifully ; yet there would be a nagging hole of uneasiness deep inside him , some flaw in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widening until he could not manage to lift his head from the pillow . Then he would have to go over every possibility . Was it something he had to do ? Somewhere to go ? Someone to see ? Until the answer came : oh yes ! today he had to call the gas company about the oven . A two-minute chore , nothing to worry about . He knew that . He knew . Yet he lay on his bed feeling flattened and defeated , and it seemed to himp87that life was a series of hurdles that he had been tripping over for decades , with the end nowhere in sight . On the Fourth of July , in a magazine article about famous Americans , he read that a man could develop character by doing one thing he disliked every day of his life . Did that mean that all these hurdles might have some value ? Jeremy copied the quotation on an index card and tacked it to the windowsill beside his bed . It was his hope that the card would remove half of every pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her child , " This is good for you . Believe me . " But in fact all it did was depress him , for it made him consciousof the number of times each day that he had to steel himself for something . Why , nine tenths of his life consisted of doing things he disliked ! Even getting up in the morning ! He had already overcome a dread before he was even dressed ! If that quotation was right , should n't he have the strongest character imaginable ? Yet he did n't . He had become aware lately that other people seemed to possess an inner core of hardness that they took for granted . They hardly seemed to notice it was there ; they had come by it naturally . Jeremy had been born without it . If he tried to conquer the very worst of his dreads  --  set out on a walk , for instance , ignoring the strings that stretched so painfully between home and the center of his back  --  his legs first became extremely heavy , so that every movement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounding and his breath grew shallow and he felt nauseated . If he succeeded , in spite of everything , in finishing what he had set out to do , he had no feeling of accomplishment but only a trembling weakness , like someone recently brushed by danger , and an echo of the nausea and a deep sense of despair . He took no steps forward . It was never easier the second time . Yet all through July , the hottest and most difficult month ofp88the year , he kept attempting things he would not have considered a few weeks ago . He went at them like a blind man , smiling fixedly ahead of him , sweating and grim-faced , pretending not to notice that inwardly , nothing changed at all . He drew from wells of strength that he did not even own . And the reason , of course , was Mary Tell . Did she know how much courage went into his daily good morning ? How even to meet her eyes meant a suicidal leap into unknown waters ? " Good , good morning , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serene and gracious , never guessing . He held tight to the doorframe and kept his knees locked so that she would not see how they trembled . Face to face with her , he felt that he was somehow growing smaller . He had to keep tilting his chin up . And why did he have this sensation of transparency ? Mary Tell 's smile encompassed the room  --  the dusty furniture , the wax fruit on the sideboard , and Jeremy Pauling , all equally , none given precedence . Her eyes were very long and deep . The fact that there was no sparkle to them gave her a self-contained look . It was impossiblethat she would ever need anyone , especially not Jeremy . Yet at night , as he lay in bed , he went over and over that moment when she had put her arms around him . She had needed him then , had n't she ? Like an old-time heroine in one of the Victorian novels his mother used to read to him , she had come in desperation , with no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded only scantily and too late . He tied his top sheet into knots , wishing the moment back so that he could do the right things . He tried to recall the smallest details . He took apart each of her movements , each pressure of her fingers upon his ribcage , each stirring of breath against his throat . He turned over all possible meanings and sub-meanings . He wondered if he had made some magical gesture that caused her to think of him in a time of trouble ,  |p89and  what gesture was it ? what trouble was it ? What made women cry in modern times , in real life ? But most of all , he wondered if it might ever happen again . Flat on his back in the dark , sleepless after his inactive days , he spent hours constructing reasons for her to turn to him . He imagined fires and floods . He invented a sudden fever for her little girl . Mary Tell would panic and come pound on his door , carrying an antique silver candlestick . He would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the doctor without a thought , no matter how many blocks from home it took him . He would keep watch beside the sickbed , a straight line of confidence for her to lean against . Her hair would just brush his cheek . What color was her hair ? What color were her eyes ? Away from her , he never could remember . He saw her in black-and-white , like a steel engraving , with fine crosshatchingshading her face and some vague rich cloak tumbling from her shoulders . Her clearest feature was her forehead  --  a pale oval . In the novels his mother read to him , a wide ivory brow stood for purity and tranquillity . Oh , if only he had a horse to carry her away on ! Mrs. Jarrett said , " That poor Mrs. Tell , she does n't get out much . Her friend hardly comes at all any more , have you noticed ? " Jeremy , watching television with the boarders , revived Mary Tell from a swoon and held a glass of brandy to her lips . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was more than a friend , " Mrs. Jarrett said . " Who is this we 're speaking of ? " asked Miss Vinton . " The gentleman Mrs. Tell was seeing . Remember ? Now he hardly comes at all . Have you noticed him lately , Mr. Paul-ing ? " Jeremy said , " Well ... "  |p90After  a while they gave up waiting for the rest of his answer . Nowadays his collages filled him with impatience . He becameconscious of the way his eyes tightened and ached when he looked at them too long . He started wishing for more texture , things standing out for themselves . He had an urge to make something solid . Not a sculpture , exactly . He shied away from anything that loomed so . But maybe if he stacked his scraps , let them rise in layers until they formed a standing shape . He pictured irregular cones , their edges ridged like stone formations on canyon floors . He imagined the zipping sound a fingernail would make running down their sides . But when he tried stacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took them away again . He went to stand by the window , but his impatience grew and extended even to his physical position : his moon face gazing out from behind the tiny clouded panes , his hands limp by his sides , fingers curled , his feet so still and purposeless , pointingnowhere in particular . How did people set about courtships ? All he had to go on were those novels . When he thought of courting Mary Tell he imagined taking her for a drive in a shiny black carriage . Or dancing across a polished ballroom  --  and he did n't even know which arm went around his partner 's waist . Yet it seemed as if some edginess were pushing him forward , compelling him to take steps he would never ordinarily think of . He pictured a high cliff he was running toward with his arms outflung , longing for the fall , not even braced to defend himself against the moment of impact . Then maybe the edginess would leave him , and he could relax again . He returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a man consulting a Ouija board . Imagi/nary voices murmured in his ear . Scraps of conversation floated past . He was used to that when he was working . Some phrases had recurred for most of his life , although they had no significance for him . " At least he is a gentle man , " one voice was sure to say . He had no idea why . Of course he was a gentle man . Yet the voice had kept insisting , year after year . Now that he was trying to concentrate , pushing away the thought of courting Mary Tell in an opera box , he absently spoke the words in a whisper . " At least he is a  --  " Then he caught himself and straightened his shoulders . Other voices crowded in . " If in any case and notwithstanding the present circumstances  --  " " I do n't know how to , do n't know how to , do n't know how to  --  " " If in any case  --  " Mary Tell sat beside him smelling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses , but her dress was out of Jane Austen 's time and the opera she was watching had not been shown for a century . Monday morning Jeremy got up early , dressed very carefully , and went to Mr. and Mrs. Dowd 's grocery store , where he bought a pound of chocolates . They were left over from Valentine 's Day  --  a heart-shaped box , a little dusty , but Mrs. Dowd wiped it off for him with a dishrag . " Somebody 's found himself a sweetheart , " she said . Jeremy was still knotted up from the ordeal of making a purchase , and he only gave a flicker of a smile and kept his eyes lowered . He returned home by way of the alley , so that he arrived in his backyard . There wild chicory flowers were waving among a tangle of sooty weeds , and he squatted and began gathering a bouquet . This was something he had thought out the night before . He had rehearsed it so thoroughly that now it seemed he was picking each flower for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps he found glossy leaves that he inserted between the chicory ,  |p92making  a pattern of blue and green . Then he rose , hugging the candy box to his chest , and went into the house . Through the kitchen , through the dining room , straight to Mary Tell 's bedroom , where he instantly knocked . If he gave himself time to think , he would fail . He would run away , scattering flowers and chocolates behind him . When she opened the door she was wearing a bathrobe and she carried a hairbrush . He noticed that the hairbrush was a wooden one with natural bristles , which gave him a sense of satisfaction . How fitting it was ! He could have said from the beginning that she would never be the type to use a nylon hairbrush . But this thought was chosen at random , to take his mind off his embarrassment . He had expected to find her dressed . He had chosen the day and the hour so carefully , knowing that she would be in now and the other boarders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrobe  --  a pink one , seersucker . Though at least her hair was up . He had n't wakened her . The brush was apparently meant for Darcy , who sat crosslegged on the bed in a pair of striped pajamas . " Hi , Mr. Pauling ! " she called out . Jeremy could n't manage a smile . " These are for , I brought these for the room , " he said . He thrust the bouquet under Mary Tell 's chin . It was terrible to see how his hands were shaking ; all the flowers nodded and whispered . " I found them by the trashcans . " " Oh ! Thank you , " she said . She looked at them a moment and then took them . Too late , he thought of the vase . Last night he had decided on his mother 's pewter pitcher from the corner cupboard in the dining room , but this morning it had slipped his mind . " Wait , " he said , " I 'll get a  --  " but she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something here . My , what a beautiful shade of blue . " They 're your blue , Mary-blue , he wanted to tell her . The blue from a madonna 's robe . He had thought of that lastp93night , but he had known all along that he would never dare to say it . Instead he looked over at Darcy , whose eyes  --  more chicory flowers  --  surveyed him steadily . " How come you brought them to us ? " she asked . " Why , just , I thought  --  " " Never mind , Mr. Pauling , " said Mary Tell . " I know why you 're here . " Jeremy stood very still , breathing raggedly . " You just have to understand , " she said . " Financially , things are a little difficult right now . Very soon I should be able to pay you , but  --  " " Pay me ? " he said . Did she think she had to buy the flowers ? " Pay you your money . I know that Saturday has come and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet I have to find work I can do at home . Till then I was hoping you would n't care if the rent was a little  --  " " The rent , oh , " Jeremy said . " Oh , that 's all right . " It is ? " " Why , of course . " He kept his eyes on the flowers . It was important to see them safely into the water . And then what ? Was he supposed to leave ? Yes , almost certainly , in view of the fact that she was wearing a bathrobe . Yet that would make the visit so short , and he wanted to be sure he did everything he was supposed to . He raised his eyes to hers , hoping for a clue . The brilliance of her smile took him by surprise . " Mr. Pauling , I just do n't know how to thank you , " she said . " Oh , why  --  " " You 've really been very kind . " " Well , but I believe they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked down at the flowers and gave a littlelaugh , and he laughed too . He had not expected that thingsp94would go so well the very first time . He watched her fetch a glass of stale water from the nightstand and set the bouquet in without disarranging a single flower , without upsetting his design . When she was finished she turned and smiled at him , apparently waiting for something . He drew in a deep breath . " Now I wish , " he said , " that you would call me Jeremy . " " Oh ! " she said . " Well , all right . " He shifted his weight to the other foot . " And you can call me Mary , " she said after a minute . " You can call me Darcy , " Darcy said from the bed . That gave them something new to laugh about , only he laughed hardest and had trouble stopping . Mary by then had returned to her smile . It became a little strained and started fading at the corners , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to go . He was glad that he had managed to catch the signal . He held out his hand and said , " Well , goodbye for now , Mrs.  --  Mary , " and she said , " Goodbye , Jeremy , " Her hand was harder than his , and surprisingly broad across the knuckles . While he was still holding it he said , " Urn , may I come back sometime ? "  --  the final hurdle of the visit . " Well , of course , " she said , and smiled again as she closed the door . Although he had not had breakfast yet he returned to his studio , because it would have been awkward to run into her again in the kitchen . He went up the stairs on the balls of his feet , feeling weightless with relief . Not even the discovery that he still carried the chocolates  --  a warped cardboard heart plastered to his chest  --  could spoil his day . He only blushed , and then smiled too widely and sat down on his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit , could n't he ? There were going to be lots of other visits . But while he was planning them he absently opened the box , and he took first one chocolate and then another and then a whole hand/ful . They had begun to melt , and they stuck to the paper doily that covered them and left imprints on his palm , but they tasted wonderful and the sweetness seeped into every corner of him and soothed his stretched , strained nerves . He knew how these things worked . First you set up the courtship ; he had just done that . Then there were certain requirements to be met  --  holding hands , a kiss  --  before he could propose . On television there were a lot of frills as well , people running through meadows together and pretending to be children at zoos and fairs and amusement parks , but he knew better than to try for anything like that . He was n't the type . She was n't the type . And after all , he had done very well so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step without any problems , and now he felt more confident about what was left . Only it turned out not to be so easy . For the next morning , when he had made a pot of percolated coffee and knocked at her room , she opened the door only halfway and it seemed as if some veil fell immediately across her face . " Yes ? " she said . Today she was dressed . ( He had deliberately waited fifteen minutes later than yesterday . ) Even Darcy was dressed . Then why did she seem so unwelcoming ? " I just made some coffee I wondered if you 'd like some , " he said all in a rush . " No , thank you , I do n't drink coffee . " That possibility had not occurred to him . " Tea , then ? " he said . " No , thank you . " " Well , maybe you 'd just like to have a glass of milk with me . " I do n't think so . I have a lot to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised himself he would seep96this through . " Please , " he said , " I do n't understand . Have I done something to offend you ? " Mary sighed and looked over her shoulder at Darcy , who was peacefully stacking dominoes on the rug . Then she stepped out of her room and shut the door behind her . She said , " Come into the parlor a minute , Mr. Pauling . " Yesterday she had called him Jeremy . He felt like someonedeaf or blind , prevented by some handicap from picking up clues that were no doubt clear to everybody else . " Is it something I 've said ? " he asked , stumbling after her . " You see , I just have no inkling ... " She led him to the couch , where he sat down while she remained standing . Then he realized his mistake and jumped up again . " Oh , excuse me , " he said . " Mr. Pauling , " said Mary , " I realize that I 'm behind on my rent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a talk about that yesterday . You said you would n't pressure me for it . But I never suspected that there were strings attached . " " Strings ? " said Jeremy . " Is n't that what this is all about ? " " I do n't understand . " Mary looked at him . He had been trying to catch her eye , but now that he had it he seemed unable to face her . He was not used to dealing with angry women . He had never pictured Mary angry at all . He said , " This is so puzzling . I do n't see  --  " " Yesterday , " said Mary , " as soon as it was clear I 'd missed paying my rent , you came calling in my room and brought me flowers . Well , I did n't think anything of it at the time but then later I  --  and today ! You come knocking again ! Do you feel that now you have some hold over me ? Because all I owe you is money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else/where and pay you this minute and be out of your house tomorrow . Is that clear ? " " Oh , my goodness , " Jeremy said . He lowered himself to the couch again . Horror curled over him like an icy film , followed by a rush of heat . He felt his face grow pink . " Oh , Mary . Mrs. Tell , " he said . " I never meant to  --  why , I was just  --  " Now a picture came to him of exactly how he had looked to Mary Tell the day before . He heard the tentative mumble of his knuckles on her door , he saw his sickly , hopeful smile , beseeching her for everything as he stuck his bouquet under her chin . This was something he was never going to be able to put out of his mind ; he knew it . He was going to go over and over it on a thousand sleepless nights , all of them spent alone , for a woman like Mary Tell would never in a million years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have guessed that . He felt himself beginning to tremble , the final indignity . " Mr. Pauling ? " Mary said . " But I 'm a good man , " he said . " What I mean to say  --  why , I never even knew you owed me ! I do n't keep track of that money , the others just put it in the cookie jar . " " Cookie jar ? " If he spoke any more she would notice his voice was shaking . " In the cookie jar , Mr. Pauling ? " " The cookie jar in the kitchen . Then I take it out to buy groceries whenever  --  " He gulped , a sound she must have heard three feet away . She came closer and bent over him , but he kept his head ducked . It was the worst moment he had ever lived through . He did n't see how it could possibly go on for so long . Could n't she leave now ? But no , he felt the sofa indenting as she settled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt , such a calm , soft blue that he felt a flood of pain for those few days when he had loved her and had some hope of her loving him back . " Jeremy , " she said.  | " I feel just terrible about this . Wo n't you say you forgive me ? I was n't thinking straight . I 'm going through a bad time just now and I must have  --  Jeremy ? " She leaned closer and took one of his hands . " Look at me a minute , " she said . Why not ? It did n't mean a thing to him any more . He raised his eyes and found the perfect oval of her face level with his . The inner corners of her eyebrows were furrowed with concern . " Wo n't you accept my apology ? " she said . He had to nod . Then he even smiled , because it had finally dawned on him what was happening : They had been discussingan issue as old-fashioned as Mary Tell herself , and here they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their courtship . Mornings now he woke feeling hopeful , and getting up was easier . He started being careful of his appearance . He began wearing a pen-and-pencil set in his shirt pocket  --  a sign of competence , he thought . He practiced smiling with his mouth shut , hiding a dark turmoil of bad teeth . In the bathroom mirror the thought of Mary hung like a mist between himselfand his reflection . Her long cool fingers reached into his chest . He carried her image downstairs with him , treading gently as if it might break up and scatter like snowflakes in a paperweight . When the other boarders greeted him he sometimesfailed to answer , but that had happened before and none of them thought anything of it . Then why did his vision of Mary Tell always turn out to be wrong ? Oh , not wrong in any concrete way . He had got her nose right , and the set of her head and the shape of her mouth . But when she entered the kitchen , tying an apron around her waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight difference in her which both disappointed and awed him . Her skin had a denser look and the planes of herp99face were flatter . Her manner of moving was more purposeful . In his mind she glided ; in real life she stepped squarely on her heels . Every night he forgot that and every morning he had to learn it all over again . In the beginning she used to make bacon and eggs for breakfast , but now their diet had changed . She and Darcy filled up on cold cereal . " We always have this , " Darcy said . " I know , honey , " said Mary , and then she told Jeremy , " YesterdayI heard of a job addressing envelopes . Do you think they 'd let me do it at home ? I 'm going to see them today and ask , and if they say yes we 'll never eat cornflakes again . " But that job fell through , and so did the next one and the one after that , and they continued to eat cornflakes while Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics of conversation . He kept a glass of orange juice in front of him , althoughhe never drank it . ( It was impossible to swallow with Mary watching . ) He rehearsed a hundred sentences offering help , what little he could manage : " Could I lend you some of the cookie jar money ? Well , then , eggs ? Just eggs ? " But he never said any of them out loud . He was afraid to . Rinsing off their little stack of dishes Mary bustled so , as if she were daring him to feel sorry for her . Then she said , " All right , Miss Slowpoke , ready to go ? " and she and Darcy would set off on their walk . Which was another change : in the beginningMary waited for her friend to call before she went out . Now she went immediately after breakfast , and the few times the telephone rang it was never for her . " Going on your walk ? " Jeremy would say . " Well now . Have a good time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing out greetings to Mr. Somerset , letting two doors slam behind them , ringing the air like a bell , and then all of a sudden the house would fall silent and the rooms would seem vacant and dead . The only sound was the creakp100of an old dry beam somewhere . A distant auto horn . Mr. Somerset 's papery slippers shambling across the dining room floor . Jeremy was like a man marooned on an island . Why had that taken him so many years to realize ? He was surrounded on four sides by streets so flat and wide that he imagined he could drown in air just walking across them . Yet look , a fouryear-oldmanaged it without a thought ! Oh , if it were n't for this handicap he could invite Mary Tell to a movie and then bring her home and kiss her outside her door as he had seen done on TV , and that would be the end of all his planning and worrying . It would be so simple ! Instead , here it was August now and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look as if he never would . Then one morning the telephone rang and no one was in the hall to answer it but Jeremy . Even before he picked up the receiver a knot of anxiety had settled low in his stomach . " Hello ? Hello ? " he said , and was answered by a voice he had not heard in weeks , but he recognized it instantly . " Mary Tell , please , " said the cigarette-ad man . " Oh ! Well , I 'll see , " Jeremy said . Then he went into the dining room and knocked on her door . " Someone wants you on the telephone , " he called . She took a minute to appear . She was already dressed , carryingher apron in her hand , and she looked startled . " Someonewants me ? " she said . " Who is it ? " " Why , I believe it 's your friend , the young man . " From behind her Darcy said , " Can I talk ? If it 's John can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mary said . Jeremy had never heard her speak so sharply to Darcy . She said , " Keep her a minute , will you , Jeremy ? " and walked off to the telephone . " Why ca n't I talk ? " Darcy asked Jeremy . " Oh , well . . . " said Jeremy . The knot in his stomach hadp101grown larger . He backed into the dining room and sat down on a chair , limply , with his hands on his knees . " How are you today , Darcy ? " he asked . Even to himself , his voice sounded foolish . He made himself smile at her . " When are you coming to my studio again ? You have n't been all week . " But he was listening , meanwhile , to Mary out in the hall . She said , " No , no , I understand . You do n't have to call ever , John . It 's not as if you 're obligated . " " But she always let me talk to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jeremy . He tried a different smile . Mary said , " Look . I 'm fine . No I do n't need money . " " Shall we cut out paper dolls ? " Jeremy asked Darcy . " Not right now , Jeremy . " " You do n't owe me anything , I 'm managing fine . I 'm fine . I still have some of what you lent me , " Mary said . And then , " What 's it to you how much is left ? It was a loan , you do n't have any business asking that . I 'm planning to pay you back . I want to . As soon as I find a job I will . " " If I go and shout into the phone John will talk to me , " Darcy said . " He likes me . I know he does . " " No , no , Darcy  --  " But she was off , skating on her stocking feet into the hallwaywith Jeremy at her heels . From this close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining , a thin violent squawk. "  --  for Darcy 's sake , " he said , and Darcy gave a little leap . " Hello John ! " she shouted . " Hello John ! " Mary held up the flat of her hand , but kept her face turned into the receiver . " All right , " she said . " You win . " " Can you hear me , John ? " " Uh , Darcy , " Jeremy said . " All right , " said Mary , " but it 's a loan , and I want you to know that . I do n't want any  --  Darcy ! Look , John , it 's hard to talk right now  --  " Darcy was tugging at her mother 's skirt , and Jeremy wasp102stooped over trying to loosen her fingers . The squawk continued on the telephone , another form of tugging . Mary 's skirt had the same cool , grainy feeling that her hands had had , that time on the couch . Why , after all , she was only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly as in his anatomical drawing class ; her lips were yet another texture , otherwise no different than her fingers had been or this clutch of skirt in Darcy 's scampering hands . " No , I mean this , " Mary said . " I want you to mail it . Do n't bring it . You are under no  --  John ? " She put the receiver down very slowly . " Oh , Mom , I wanted to talk , " Darcy said . Then Jeremy straightened and looked into Mary 's face . Her expression was cheerful and she was even smiling slightly , but tears were running down her cheeks . " I 'm sorry  --  " she said . She started back toward the bedroom , with Jeremy and Darcy stumbling over each other trying to follow . " You must think I make a habit of this , " she said in her doorway . She turned , and Jeremy was so close behind her that before he thought , he had found the strength to lean forward on tiptoe and kiss the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and she looked his way for a moment before her eyes seemed to focus on him . " Thank you , Jeremy , " she said . " You are a very sweet man . " She wiped the tears away with the back of her hand , giving a little laugh at herself as if they embarrassed her . She shook out her apron and said , " Come along , Miss Chatterbox , let 's get you some breakfast , shall we ? " Then they went off toward the kitchen , leaving Jeremy smiling so hard that he could barely see . He thought he might just inflate and float away like a balloon at a birthday party . In magazine cartoons , a suitor proposing marriage always knelt on the floor at his sweetheart 's feet . Now , was that an accuratereflection of the way things were done ? He suspectedp103not . Nevertheless he kept picturing himself looking up at Mary from a kneeling position , finding her even more frighteningat this angle  --  her sandals the largest part of her , her waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white triangle of skin beneath her jaw . " I do n't have much money , " he should tell her ( the speech owed to her father , he believed , but he had no idea who her father was ) . " I would n't be able to support you in very good style but at least it would be a little easier , I do have my pieces and a little from my mother and sometimes I win a contest and I always seem to have enough for groceries . " He prepared himself for the way the hem of her dress would loom , and for the difficulty of judging her expression from so far beneath it . Yet every night he went to bed with nothing resolved , feeling thin and strained as if this balloon of hope he had become had been kept too fully inflated for too long a time . He dreamed of losing things  --  unnamed objects in small boxes , the roof of his house , pieces of art that he would never be able to re-create . He woke feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card tacked to the windowsill beside him . In his imagination this proposal always took place outdoors somewhere , although of course that would be too public . Could he be thinking of a park ? The nearest park was several blocks from home . He pushed away the outdoor images and in the mornings , while he sat with his orange juice and she poured cornflakes , he tried to think of some natural way to lead in to what was on his mind . He could n't . Mary talked about her daughter and the weather and library books , nothing more personal . " Now Darcy is shooting out of all her clothes . I 've never seen a child grow the way she does . I thought as soon as I got a job I would buy some material and borrow Mrs. Jarrett 's sewing machine , but sewing has never been my strong point and I 'm not at all sure that I  --  " How could he bring love into a conversation like that ? She gave him nop104openings . He sometimes thought that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to ask even the simplestthings that occurred to him : Where do you come from ? Why are you here ? Who was your husband ? What are your plans ? " At home Darcy used to beg for cornflakes , " Mary said once . " I 've never seen a child so contrary . " " Where was that ? " Jeremy asked her . " What ? " " Where was your home ? " " Oh , well  --  and now she wants bacon and eggs , would n't you know ? I believe she just thinks up these things to devil me . " Jeremy did n't press her . He contented himself with the surfacethat she presented to the world , and it was only inside him that the questions continued . What happened to your husband ? Why did you cry with that man John ? What is his significance ? Will you marry me ? Now each morning that he failed to propose he saw them to the door , tagging after them in the hope that somewhere along the way  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he might gather his courage . He took to going out on the steps and waving after them . " Goodbye ! Goodbye ! Have a nice walk ! " Turning back afterward was worse than being left in the kitchen . He always felt oppressed by the sudden dark coolness as he stepped inside . He started accompanying them farther  --  to the second house , to the third . Maybe , given time , he could follow Mary all the way off his island . Gradually : was n't that the key ? Oh , if there were any god he believed in , it was gradualness ! If people would only let him go at things his own way , step by step , never requiring these suddenleaps that seem to happen in the outside world ! But every day he was overtaken by some magnetic force that seemed top105affect only him . It dragged him back with a tug at his spine ; it caused him to slow and then to halt , damp with exhaustion . " Goodbye ! Goodbye ! Have a nice walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They separated cheerfully at the approach of total strangers , they talked aloud without fear of being heard , they crossed the wide street against the light . Dogs with enormous grinning mouths sniffed at Mary 's skirt and she never even noticed . Oh , he had undertaken too much . He could never keep up with a woman like that . He turned and trudged homeward , stumbling over cracks in the sidewalk and muttering words of encouragement to himself , and before he started the day 's work he had to lie on the couch in his studio a while catching his breath and trying to still the twitching of his leg muscles . It seemed to him that his sisters were always calling him on the telephone nowadays . " What are you doing , Jeremy , why have n't we heard from you ? Are you getting out more ? Are you eating right ? " They no longer phoned only on Sundaysbut occasionally on weekday evenings as well , on Saturdaysand in the middle of lunch . Then one morning they called so early that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jeremy , honey , this is Laura , " he heard , and although he had always felt close to Laura he was conscious now of a sudden impatience tightening his fingers on the receiver . In the kitchen Darcy said something and Mary laughed . There was no telling what he was missing . " Is there something  --  what seems to be the matter ? " he asked her . " Matter ? I was just worried about you , dear . You have n't answered our last letter . " " But I do n't believe I received any letter this week , " he told her . Then , too late , he remembered the flowered envelope that he had absently stuck in his shirt pocket on the way upstairsthe other day . It was probably in the bathroom hamper . " He says he did n't get any letter , " Laura told Amanda . Top106Jeremy she said , " Honestly , they can fly to Europe but they ca n't get a simple note from Richmond to Baltimore . Well , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say a few words . Amanda ? " " How do you seem to be getting along , Jeremy , " Amanda 's voice said very close to his ear . " Oh , fine , thank you . " " I told Laura there was no need to call but she said she had a funny feeling , she gets them more and more these days . Any fool should know you ca n't trust the U.S. mail . " Jeremy stood up straighter . It always occurred to him , when talking on the telephone , that to people at the other end of the line he was invisible . Except for the thin thread of his voice he did not even exist . " Jeremy ! " Amanda said sharply , and he said , " Yes , I 'm here "  --  reassuring both himself and her . " Labor Day is coming up , Jeremy . " " Oh , yes , is it ? " " Maybe you could make the trip to see us . " " Well , Amanda ... " " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm sending you a train schedule . Let 's not hear any excuses , Jeremy . Why , you 'll just love travel , once you catch on to it . And you do n't want to spend your life just sitting home now , do you . Mother would n't have approved of that at all , she would have wanted you to get out and enjoy yourself . " He knew that his sisters were all that was left of the world he had grown up with , his only remaining connection with his parents , but sometimes when Amanda spoke of their mother it seemed she meant someone he did n't even know in passing  --  someone stern and rigid , not his own sweet-faced mother with her soft , sad smile . " Well , you see , " he said , " I do try to  --  " " I have to run , Jeremy . Do please answer our letters , you know how Laura worries . "  | " All right , Amanda . " He laid the receiver carefully in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been . He went back to the kitchen and found Mary just sponging Darcy 's face , with breakfast finished . He had missed everything . His chances were over until tomorrow . " I 'm going to the grocery , " Mary told him . " Do you want anything ? " His despair was so enormous that it gave him courage . He said , " Oh , why , several things . Perhaps I should come along . " Mary only nodded . She was frowning at a stain on Darcy 's collar . " Oh , Darcy , look at you , it 's your last clean dress , " she said . " I do n't care about an old stain . " " Well , I do . Come along then . " Words kept rearranging themselves in Jeremy 's head . May I have the honor  --  ? Could you possibly consider  --  ? Is it askingtoo much for you to marry me ? But once they were descendingthe front steps the only conversation he could think of was an exaggerated squint toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't look up . She was readingher grocery list . " I 'm going to get a gumball , " Darcy said . " Am I going to get a gumball , Mom ? I 'm going to get a penny for the gumball machine . " " I was n't aware they had a gumball machine , " said Jeremy . " Oh yes , " Darcy said . " Perry 's does . " Would you think me forward if I  --  ? Perry 's ? Why , Perry 's was two blocks away ; it was where his mother used to go for soupbones . And no sooner had it hit him than sure enough , they came to Dowd 's grocery and passed it by , with neither Mary nor Darcy giving it a glance . Jeremy did . He gazed longingly at the crates of oranges and peaches and pears slanted toward him behind the fly-specked plate glass window . The tissue paper they nestled in seemed a particularly beautiful shade of green . He thought with lovep108of Mrs. Dowd 's gnarled old hands spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting it back in place with a little grandmotherly pat . Mary and Darcy walked on . " Wait ! " he said . " I mean  --  have you ever tried Dowd 's ? " " They 're more expensive , " Mary said . She went on studyingher list . Darcy took Jeremy 's hand in both of hers and swung on it  --  a clamp on his index finger , another on his little finger . What could he do ? He set one foot in front of the other , doggedly , barely managing each step . For Mary Tell 's sake he was slaying dragons , and yet to keep her respect it was necessary that she never even guess it . He wiped his face on his sleeve . They came to the end of the block , where a red light stopped them . Cars whizzed back and forth , but what he was most afraid of was the street itself . Then the light turned green . " Wait ! " he said again . Mary looked up , in the act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we  --  I mean I do n't believe I  --  " " Hurry , " Darcy said , " we 'll miss the light . " He stepped off the curb . All the comfort he had was Darcy 's grip on his hand , but now Mary said , " Darcy , do n't swing on people . How often have I told you that ? " One of Darcy 's hands fell away ; only his index finger was secure . He reached out blindly and found Mary 's arm , the crook of her elbow , which he hung onto as he had seen men do on the late show . Did she notice that it was she supporting him and not the other way around ? " I certainly wish the price of tomatoes would go down , " Mary said . Then they had reached the other sidewalk . The air on this block was different . He could have told it with his eyes shut . It was hotter , more exposed , and old Mrs. Carraway 's wind chimes were not tinkling . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the look of it . He noticed that the rowhouses ran only in twos and threes , which gave the block a broken-up look . A mean-eyed woman watched him from herp109front stoop . He saw a commercial printer 's whose black and gold sign must have been here years ago , when he was a boy walking to school . Its sudden emergence in his memory made him feel strange . He lowered his eyes again . Pretend this is only a corridor leading off from the vestibule . Pretend it is just an unusually long room . It will all be over in a while . Then they reached Perry 's . " Here we are , " said Mary . He looked up to find a window full of dead things stacked in pyramids  --  tinned vegetables , Nabisco boxes , paper towels . No fruit . " I 'll wait outside , " he said . " Outside ? " " I 'll just  --  I do my shopping at Dowd 's . " Mary seemed about to ask him a question , but then Darcy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What penny ? " Mary said . " You said you would give me a penny for the gumball machine . You said you would . You said  --  " " Oh , for mercy 's sake , " said Mary , opening her pocketbook . " Here . " Then she went in , and Jeremy chose a place outside the door . First he watched the street , but the unfamiliar buildingsopposite made him feel worse . He looked behind him , toward the glass door , and saw Darcy just coming out with a gumball . " Look . Pink , " she said . " My favorite color . " " Is that right ? " said Jeremy . He was glad to see her . He turned outward again , so that he was facing the street . Darcy stood beside him . " They have charms and things too , " she said . " You can see them in the machine but they never come out . Do you think I might get one someday ? " " Perhaps so , " Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You think that 's what it is ? You think they 're just trying to get your pennies from you ? " Jeremy had a terrible thought . He felt that he might becomemarooned beside Perry 's Grocery . How would he everp110get home again ? He imagined himself dipping the toe of one shoe into the street , then drawing it out and turning away , unable to cross . " I 'm sorry , I just ca n't , " he would have to say . He thought of the time he had climbed the crape myrtle tree in his back yard when he was three . He had climbed only to the first fork but then had found it impossible to get back down . Every time he tried , his hair stood on end and the soles of his feet started tingling . " Let him stay , " his father said . " He 'll come down . " Then at night , when he still had n't managed it , his father took three long strides to the tree and lifted him off roughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream in that single dizzying moment before his feet touched solid ground again . Now Mary would take him in hand , nudge him out , coax him into one step after another . " Come on , you can do it , you 'll see , when you get to the other side you 'll look back and laugh at how easy it was . " Only he would n't . He would have to back away , and now he was too big to be carried bodily . He imagined spending the rest of his life on this new island , exposed for all the world to see , propped against the wall like a target . " Would you like half of my gumball , Jeremy ? " Darcy asked him . " No , thank you , Darcy , " he said . " I do n't have a knife , but I could bite it in half . " Dread rose in him like a flood in a basement , starting in his feet and rapidly filling his legs , his stomach , his chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay level across the top of his throat . He swallowed and felt it tip and right itself . Nausea came swooping over him , and he buckled at the knees and slid downward until he was seated flat on the sidewalk with his feet sticking out in front of him . " Jeremy , you silly , " Darcy said , but when he could n't smile at her or even raise his eyes she said , " Jeremy ? Jeremy ? " She went screaming into the grocery store ; her voice pierced all the cotton that seemedp111to be wrapped around his head . " Mom , come quick , Jeremy 's all squashed down on the sidewalk ! " Then he was surrounded by anxious feet nosing in upon him  --  Darcy 's sneakers , Mary 's sandals , and a pair of stubby loafers almost covered by a long bloody apron . " It 's the heat , " the apron said . Mary said , " Jeremy ? Are you ill ? " " Sick , " he whispered . She set a rustling paper bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead and then straightened up . Her sandals were the largest thing about her . The hem of her skirt was so close he could see the stitches , he saw the underside of her bosom and the triangle below her jaw . " Will you marry me ? " he asked her . She laughed . " No , but I 'll see you home and into bed , " she said . " Can you stand ? You need some air . " And she raised his head herself , and then propped him while he got to his feet . She said , " Walk a ways , now . It 'll clear your head . Here , take this . " From her grocery bag she brought out a navy blue box , and while he swayed against her she tore the wrapper off and handed him a cinnamon graham cracker . " Sometimes it helps to eat a little something , " she said . No , no . " " Try it , Jeremy . " He only clutched it in his hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to pour out of him . Inch by inch he headed homeward , shaky but upright , leaning on Mary 's arm . The bloody apron receded behind them . Darcy danced ahead . They came closer to the street while Jeremy prayed continuously to the traffic light : oh , please turn red , turn red , let me at least have time to get my bearings . But it stayed an evil green , and Mary led him without a pause off the curb , across a desert of cement , up the other side . They were home . They were on his own block.  |p112He  straightened and let out a long slow breath . Mary said , " You 're just like Darcy , whenever you do n't eat breakfast you get sick to your stomach . Is n't that what happened ? " " I meant it seriously , I asked you to marry me , " Jeremy said . " But you both say no , you could n't eat a thing , you do n't want a ... " She stopped walking . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful , while Jeremy waited with his head down . " Oh , Jeremy , " she said finally . " Why , thank you , Jeremy . But you see , I ca n't get married . " " You ca n't ? " " My husband wo n't give me a divorce . " " Oh , I see , " Jeremy said . " But it was sweet of you to ask , and I want you to know how flattered I am . " " That 's all right , " Jeremy said . He stood there a minute more , and then they both began walking again . Up ahead , Darcy leaped and skipped and twirled . Her hair made him think of something metallic fallingthrough the air , catching the sunlight and ducking it and catching it once more . He fixed his eyes on it and stumbled along . When they were within sight of home he lifted his cracker without thinking and took a bite . Mary was right ; it helped . His head cleared . His stomach righted itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the tinny taste , leaving his breath as pure as a child 's . Like a child he let himself be led home while all his attention was directed toward the cracker . Crunching sounds filled his head and tiny sharp crumbs sprinkled his shirt front . He felt limp and exhausted , and something like relief was turning his bones so watery that he could have lain down right there and gone to sleep on the sidewalk.  |p113Now  he no longer came downstairs while Mary was making breakfast . He lay in bed late and rose by degrees , often sitting against his pillow for as much as an hour and staring vacantly out his window . The index card lost its tack and fell behind his bed ; he let it lie . He sat in a sagging position , smoothing his sheet over and over across his chest , and if he wanted a change of scenery he raised his eyes from the screened lower portion of the window , which was open , to the closed upper portion where two sets of cloudy panes dulled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The floors had a frame of dirt spreading out from the baseboards , thinningonly where his traffic pattern had worn the dust away . There were little chips of paper everywhere , some so old that they seemed to have become embedded in the wood . If the light was right he could look out toward his studio and find a long glinting red hair snagged on one of the floorboards . It had belonged to a student from two years ago , whose name he had forgotten . He neither swept the hair away nor made any special effort to keep it . It was just there , something he registered in the mornings without considering the possibility that there was anything he might do about it . When he had finally struggled out of bed there was the bathroom to face  --  a chilly place even in summer , with all its fixtures crazed and rust-stained and the swinging naked lightbulb pointing out every pore of his skin in the watery mirror . He shaved for hours . He cut one small path across his cheek and then stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lift his razor again . Even before the mirror he did not bother rearranging his expression . His muscles sagged and the soft skin of his throat pouched outward . He noticed , and disliked what he saw , but only in the detached way that he might dislike a painting or some scene that he witnessed on the street . Then when he was tired of shaving he left , often without rinsing off the last traces of soap , sop114that his skin felt itchy and dry . He wrapped himself in a bathrobe and put on his crocheted slippers and shuffled into his studio , where he sat on a stool for a long time looking at his latest piece . Too many browns . Not enough distinctions . More and more now he was adding in actual objects  --  thumbtacksand washers and bits of string and wood , separating the blur of colored papers . Brian had n't seen these yet . Jeremy did n't care whether he saw them or not . He pulled off a piece of twine that was in the wrong corner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped it to the floor and then noticed , beside one leg of his stool , the tin top off a box of cough lozenges , and by the time he had figured where to paste that he had forgotten about dressing . He snipped things apart and fitted things together . He rummaged through the clutter in a bureau drawer , meanwhile holding his bathrobe together by its frayed sash . Till Mrs. Jarrett 's clopping heels mounted laboriously to the second floor and she called up to the third , " Mr. Pauling ? I do n't see your dishes here , have you not had breakfast ? We 're getting worried about you . Please come . " If he were too absorbed he merely shuffled his feet on the floor , showing he had n't died in his sleep . Other times he sighed and laid his scissors down and went to his bedroom for clothes . Most of his clothes seemed to be falling apart nowadays . He kept having to throw away shirts with long rips and trousers with the zippers broken and shorts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sears for more . He tossed them in the wastebasket almost gladly . Later he would listen with a sense of satisfaction while the garbage men came clanging trashcans and bore his belongings away with them . It felt good to be done with things . He thought of the New Year 's Eves he had sat up for  --  the relief that came from putting away another year and brushing off his hands and knowing that there were twelve months less to get through . Or of all his life  --  the hundreds of memories he had closed the files on ,  |p115the  years assigned to him that he had dutifully endured , waiting to reach the bottom of the pile . His breakfast was other people 's lunch . Mrs. Jarrett ate in the dining room with everything just right , dishes set on one of his mother 's linen placemats and a matching napkin in her lap . Mr. Somerset wolfed a lacy fried egg straight from the skillet . Miss Vinton , home from the bookstore on her lunch hour , read publishers ' brochures while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a new Klee in , Mr. Pauling , " she might say , without looking up . " I put it on the sideboard . " " Oh , why , thank you , Miss Vinton . " He ate whatever took the least trouble  --  a box of day-old doughnuts or a can of cold soup . After every mouthful he wiped his hands carefully on the knees of his trousers before turning a page of the Klee . It would have to go back with Miss Vinton , spic and span , before her boss noticed it was missing . The cover of the book was a glossy white , promising him something new and untouched and wonderful . At the beginningthere was a long jumble of words , a resume of Paul Klee 's life , which Jeremy skipped . What did he care about that ? He plunged into the pictures ; he drank them up , he felt how dry and porous he was , thirsty for things to look at . At every page he wanted to pause and spend hours , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he felt a pull also to turn to the next one quickly so that he would be sure to finish in time . Sometimes he said , " Miss Vinton , I wonder if I might  --  ? " " Oh , why surely , Mr. Pauling , " she said , refolding the bread wrapper . " I can always take it back tomorrow . Mr. Mack wo n't notice . " She had never once hurriedhim or shown any concern over his handling of the books , although Jeremy knew that Mr. Mack was unreasonably strict about such things . And for all of August , when Jeremy 's life seemed duller and sadder than he had ever noticed before , she managed to bring a new book for him almost every day ,  |p116as  if she guessed that he needed comfort . Klee , a collection of impressionists , Miro , Renoir . A book of American primitives whose dollhouse landscapes and lack of perspective filled him with a kind of homesickness . If only he could just step inside them ! If only he lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet never grow smaller ! Miss Vinton brought him Braque , a man he disliked . He sat through her lunch hour testing the anxiety that each picture called forth in him , the discomfort caused by some clumsiness in the shapes . Years before , when he was in high school , an art teacher explaining cubism had made Jeremy 's class copy one of Braque 's paintingsline for line . Jeremy had felt sick all the while he was doing it . It seemed that he might melt away to nothing , lettinghimself get absorbed into another man 's picture that way . Now he found the picture again  --  a still life involving a musicalinstrument  --  and stared at it until he could n't stand it any more and had to turn the page . " Would you care to keep it till tomorrow ? " asked Miss Vinton , rising to rinse her dishes . " You seem to like him . " " What ? No , no , " Jeremy said , " please , I do n't want it , take it back with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he blushed and looked up at her . In the summertime , stripped of her lavender cardigan , her bony freckled arms gave her a vulnerable look . White strings stood out along the inside of her wrist when she turned the faucet off . " But I 'm grateful to you for bringing the book , " Jeremy said . " I 'm sorry , I did n't mean " Oh , that 's all right , I never much liked him myself . " She turned , cheerful as ever , to hang up her dishtowel and take her purse from the table . Meanwhile Mrs. Jarrett ate fruit cup in the dining room , the ladylike clink of her spoon sounding at perfectly spaced intervals . Mr. Somerset put his skillet down silently and gravely , making certain that it sat in the exact center of the circle of the burner , ready to be usedp117at another meal . Was there anyone gentler than old people ? Could he ever feel as much at rest as he did sitting in this triangle of muted gray voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in answer  --  Darcy slamming the door and pounding down the hallway with a bucket full of dandelions , Mary laughing and calling out warnings and threats and promises , and maybe if it were a weekend Howard 's high-pitched whistle and the squeak of his sneakers . " Where 's the milk I left here ? " " Who wants a dandelion ? " " You 're going to bump into someone , Darcy ! "  --  which Darcy would almost surely do , as if she had to depend on someone else to break her speed for her . Flunf ! into Miss Vinton 's middle . " Oh , Darcy , say you 're sorry . " " No harm done , " said Miss Vinton , and Darcy spun on through the kitchen , ending up with her arms around Howard . " Howard , make me flapjacks , Howard . " " Let him be , Darcy . " " Oh now , " Howard said to Mary , " you 're just jealous because I wo n't make you flapjacks . " Then the kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and left while Mr. Somerset turned slowly from the stove , dazed by the laughter , baffled by frivolity . " What ? " he said . Mary folded Darcy into the circle of her arms and said , " Milk or apple juice , young lady ? " " Both , " said Darcy . " Or wait . Is apple juice what I want ? " She turned toward Jeremy as if she expected him to answer , but Jeremy was looking at Mary . He saw the curve of her cheek against Darcy 's tow hair ; he noticed how her nearly unarched eyebrows calmed and rested him . Why had n't he been granted the one thing in life he ever hoped for ? At the beginning of September , Darcy started kindergarten and Mary found a job . It was something she could do at home : making argyle socks on a knitting machine . In the morning while Darcy was at school Mary worked alone in herp118room , but Darcy returned at lunchtime and was in and out all the rest of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine soon became part of the household . It consisted of a circle of vertical needles , which first had to be threaded one by one . Threading was the time-consuming part . Then Mary cranked a large handle a prescribed number of times , after which she paused to rethread in another color . Jeremy , passing her doorway , had a glimpse of her huddled in a C-shape and frowning at metal eyes that seemed far too close together . She reminded him of old photographs of life in a sweatshop . But when the threading was done she could straighten up and stand back , and the cranking was so easy that sometimes she let Darcy do it while she herself counted the strokes . Numbers rang out and floated through the house  --  " Thirty-six ! Thirty-seven ! " After the tense silence of the threading , her voice and the circular rattle of machinery seemed like an outburst of joy . Wherever he was , Jeremy would raise his head to listen , and he noticed that the whole house appeared to relax at those times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too had held tense during the threading . At the end of her first week of work , Mary packed the completedsocks in a cardboard carton . She left Darcy with Mrs. Jarrett and caught a bus to the factory , where she was supposedto deliver them . " Why ca n't I come too ? " Darcy asked . " Because it would n't be any fun , " Mrs. Jarrett told her . " The place where Mommy is going is the factory section , all nasty and dirty . " Jeremy felt something shrink in him . As if her absence were one long threading period , he held himself rigid in a parlor chair , scarcely breathing , silently turning the pages of a book of old masters that his mother had given him . " Goodness , do n't you have anything to do ? " Mrs. Jarrett asked once . " I thought Saturday your students came . " Jeremy looked up , still turning pages . He had lost his last student a monthp119ago and no others had called yet , but before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and he forgot to answer . Mary returned just before lunch , bringing a new carton of yarn . When Darcy heard she came running out of the kitchen with Mrs. Jarrett close behind , and Jeremy stood up holding his book to his stomach . He thought that now the shrunken feeling would leave him , but it did n't . Mary 's face was gray and her shoulders sagged . " How 's our career woman ? " Mrs. Jarrett asked , clapping her hands together . " Oh well , I 'm all right . " " You seem a little tired . " " I had to wait in line a while , " Mary said . " There are a lot of other people doing this work . " " Is that right ? And just think , I never even heard of it before . Did you meet anybody interesting ? " " Oh , trash mostly . Just , you know . Just trash . " She set her carton on the coffee table and sat down . " I did n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Now be sure they pay you what they owe , you hear ? " Jeremy , back in his armchair now , kept nodding his head to show that he agreed . He felt as tired and sad as Mary . He wanted to offer her something  --  a cup of coffee ? She did n't drink coffee . In his mother 's old books a rich gentleman would come now to rescue Mary from life in the sweatshop , but Jeremy was the only gentleman present and he was n't rich and he did n't believe that Mary had even noticed he was in the room . She spoke solely to Mrs. Jarrett . She said , " Oh , they paid me what they owed . But I had made a few mistakes , and also I 'm still slow . Some of these people just whip them out by the dozen , but I do n't . I do n't know why . I thought I was going so fast . I thought I could make up the rent and the grocery and Darcy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day . "  | " Now , now , " said Mrs. Jarrett . " Give yourself time . " Jeremy went on nodding . He kept his eyes fixed on the label at the end of the yarn box  --  a rectangle of glaring yellow , a color he had always disliked . The brightness of it made his eyes ache . He imagined himself winning twenty-five thousand dollars from some soap company and offering it to her , watching her brow slowly smooth and lighten as she looked down and saw what he had put into her hands . " No , no , " he would tell her , " no strings . You do n't even have to be my friend , just please do n't thread those needles any more ... " Yet if she had that much money , would n't she leave him ? Well , but had n't she left him already ? Had she ever really been there ? " Now can we have our ice cream ? " Darcy said . She had been promised a treat . Mary had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Not yet , Darcy , let Mommy rest a while , " but Mary said , " No , I 'm all right . Let 's go . " She picked up her pocketbook and they went out the front door . This time there were no slams , no voices calling back and forth outside . The house felt the same when they were out as when they were in , bleak and dark and tired . Mrs. Jarrett settled with a sigh onto the creaking springs of the couch . Jeremy turned a page and smoothed the edges of a Rubens . " It 's a shame , it 's just a shame , " Mrs. Jarrett said . " Do you think they 'll have to go on welfare ? " The word stabbed him . He looked up , open-mouthed . " And she 's bright as a button . I do n't care what you say . A high school diploma is n't everything . " " Welfare ? " Jeremy said . But Mrs. Jarrett was talking to her needlework . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . ' I do , do n't I , ' she said , and just laughed , did n't take me seriously , but I meant what I said . Now I do n't know what happened there , widowed or divorced or what , but she is a young womanp121still and on top of that she has that child . Have you noticed how out of hand that child has gotten ? She used to be a real little lady . She needs a father , and you can tell it by the numberof times that she says a thing over again . Shows she is n't listened to enough , her mother has worries on her mind and ca n't pay attention . Not that I blame her , of course , I realize what a  --  " Jeremy blinked down at the Rubens , a fat naked blond lady laughing . He felt that Mrs. Jarrett 's words were twining around him like vines , rooting in the sad darkness inside him . The fat lady reminded him of a student he had once had , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrait painting . She weighed two hundred pounds ; she had told him so herself . She seemed proud of it . Once she asked him , " Would you like a nude model ? I could do it . " And then she had come very close and laid a hand on his arm , smiling at him but looking , for some reason , only at his mouth . " No , no , " he had said . He was unprepared . He backed off , shaking his head , and stumbled over a tin can full of brushes . " No , that 's all right , I do n't paint at all , really . " But afterwards he had lain awake regretting his answer , and Sally Ann , whom he had not liked , gained importance in his mind and he began to see that there could be something compelling about a person who was dimpled all over . Only the next time she came to the studio he found that he still disliked her , and he kept himself at a distance even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened ? Did she stop coming ? He could n't remember . He stared down at the Rubens , who laughed directly at him with her eyelids lowered , and he felt some sort of wasted feeling , as if he were a very old man realizing for the first time how little was left to him. " ... and then my very own sister was married four times , " said Mrs. Jarrett . " Well , some claimed that was carrying things too far , but I do n't know . I do n't know that I blamep122her at all , to tell the truth . We do need someone to lean on . I imagine I 'll spend the rest of my life feeling naked on my street side every time I take a walk , and I am sixty-four now and been a widow longer than a wife . " Jeremy sank lower in his chair , letting the book fall shut , and closed his eyes . He kept them closed for so long that Mrs. Jarrett thought he had gone to sleep . Anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the night he woke with the feeling that he had just heard his name called , but he found it was a dream . He could n't get to sleep again . First he was cold , and he had to kneel in his bed and tug the window shut . Then he discoveredhe had a headache . He felt his way to the bathroom , found an aspirin tin , and washed two tablets down with a mouthful of lukewarm water from the faucet . In the mirror his silhouette was gilt-edged with moonlight . He studied how his shoulders sloped . He reminded himself of a low hill . There seemed to be no good reason to move any more , even to go back to bed . He stood rooted at the sink . Then far below him he heard a whirring sound , so faint he might have imagined it . He cocked his head , trying to place its source . With his hands stretched before him like a sleepwalker he guided himself out of the bathroom and into his studio , toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even there he took a minute to identify it : the cranking of Mary 's sock machine . He placed both hands on the windowsill and lowered his head , forming a clear image of her in some long flowing flannel nightgown , a shawl around her shoulders , working away by the light of a smoky lantern . Then he turned and went back to his bedroom . Still in the dark , he opened drawers and slid hangers down his closet rod and rummaged through his shoebag . He found the one dress shirt he possessed , easily recognizable in itsp123crackling cellophane envelope from the laundry . It was limp and sleazy and the collar was frayed , but he thought it would do . He knotted a tie , fumbling a little , trying to remember the complicated set of motions learned from Mr. Somerset 's predecessor many years before . Then his suit  --  a three-piecer , ordered by mail back in the fifties but it still fit fairly well . Socks that might or might not match  --  he could n't tell for sure and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black shoes , also mail-order . A handkerchief tucked in his breast pocket the way his mother had taught him . Then back in front of the bathroom mirror he combed his hair , puffing up the little moonlit cloud skimming his scalp . He set the comb down on the edge of the sink and walked very slowly out of the room and toward the stairs . Every step made him sicker , but he did n't let himself feel it . All the doors on the second floor were closed and dark . The only sound was a ragged snore from Mr. Somerset 's room . On the first floor , street lights shining in picked up the shapes of the furniture but not its colors . Everything was a different shade of velvety gray , like what he had imagined a color-blind man must see . Jeremy had often tried to picture color-blindness  --  theworst affliction he could imagine next to blindness itself  --  and now , as if this were the only reason he had dressed up and come downstairs , he stood for a while letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started up again . He straightened his shoulders and passed through the parlor and into the dining room , where a knife blade of light shone beneath Mary 's door . His first knock was not heard , but at the second knock the machine stopped . There was a moment of silence . Then , Is someone there ? " she asked . " It 's me , it 's Jeremy . " eremy ? " " I 'm sorry to bother you at this  --  " The doorknob rattled , so loudly and so close to him thatp124he started . Light flooded the dining room and screwed his eyes up , and Mary stood before him in her blue dress with her hair still knotted as if this were daytime . " Was I disturbingyou ? " she asked him . " I thought while Darcy was sleeping I might turn out a few extra pairs . " " No , no . " Darcy lay sprawled in the double bed , taking up more than her share of it . She was shielded from the light by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lamp bulb . Now that Jeremy 's eyes were adjusting he saw that the room was actually dim . He could n't imagine how anyone would be able to thread a needle here . " I should have thought , " he said . " You do n't have to keep the machine in your bedroom , you can set it up anywhere . No one will mind . I did n't guess that you would be doing this while Darcy was asleep , you see  --  " He whispered , taking care not to wake Darcy , but Mary spoke in a normal tone . " Why , that 's very nice of you , Jeremy , " she said , " but I do n't believe it bothers her . She 's a very sound sleeper . " They both looked at Darcy , who seemed pale and waxy , with her eyes sealed and her arms and legs still for once . " Thank you for thinking of it , though , " Mary said , turning back and giving him a bright , social smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer her space . She expected him to go now . " Maybe I 'll quit for tonight anyway , " she said . " I do feel a little tired . " " But nobody knows you 're still married , " Jeremy said suddenly . She stopped smiling . " They think you 're widowed , or divorced . They do n't know you 're not free to remarry . " " Jeremy , really I  --  " " Please listen . That 's all I 'm asking , if you say no I wo n't ever trouble you again . Listen . You see how well you fit inp125here . Sometimes we have had new boarders come in one day and leave the next , they just do n't seem to like it . But you did n't do that . You 've stayed a whole season with us . " " Yes , but you see I really did n't  --  " " You fit in here . Everybody wants you to stay . And you know it has a lot of advantages , kitchen privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why , I do make a little money from time to time , not very much I know but enough so that you could stop knitting argyles , and besides Darcy needs a father , they say she 's getting out of hand without one " Who says that ? " Mary asked , so loudly that Darcy stirred and murmured . " Mrs. Jarrett does . " " Well , I 'm very surprised at her . " " So this is what I was considering , " Jeremy said . " Could n't we just pretend to be married ? " Mary stared at him . " Oh no , please do n't be angry , " he told her , stumbling to get the words out . " I know how it sounds . But you see , to me it would be marriage . It is n't as if there were any other way we could do it . We could go out one morning all dressed up and then come in and tell the others we 'd been married at City Hall . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be married in the eyes of everyone we know , and I would take care of you and you would start another life instead of going along on tag ends the way you are now , you could give all your time to Darcy and have more children if you wanted and never have to leave them to go out and work in sweat-shops  --  " " Jeremy , dear , " Mary said , " I 'm sure you are saying all this with the best of intentions  --  " " I am , " he said sadly . He understood now that she would refuse , but still he had to go on . " I am proposing , not proposi/tioning . I mean only the deepest respect , " he told her , and he looked up to find her nearly smiling , no longer so severe but kind-faced and amused , gently shaking her head . " Besides , " he said , beginning to mumble , " I love you . " " Thank you , Jeremy . I do appreciate it . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep on saying no to everything new ? " But he was speaking mainly to himself now , offering himselfconsolation , and he had already turned to go . He saw the dining room lit into color from Mary 's doorway , a clump of dusty strawflowers turning orange on the table . Then her face appeared in his mind as it had looked at the moment of his turning  --  the smile fading , the eyes suddenly darker and more thoughtful . He turned back again . Mary took a breath , and he knew from the sudden shock and panic flooding through him that she was about to say yes.  |p127The  way it used to be , I stayed home with the children while Jeremy took Mary to the hospital by taxi . This was before I had bought my little car . Mary would wake me in the night just to let me know I was in charge  --  " Now do n't get up ! " she always said , but of course I did get up , I would n't have missed the excitement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say goodbye , only then it would turn out that they were n't quite ready to go yet . Mary was waiting at the front door with her overnight case and Jeremy was off trying to locate the house keys or change for the taxi . I kept Mary company . We just stood there smiling at each other . We beamed . Never mind that I am an old maid ; I can still recognize a happy occasion when I see one . When Jeremy arrived , all worried and shaky , I would find his coat for him and help him into it . " Hurry now , " I 'd say . " I hear the taxi . Do n't let him leave you . " I slid back bolts and flung open first the inner door and then the outer door , I burst into thep128frosty night air ahead of them . I wanted to shout out a fanfare : " Make way ! Make way ! We have a pregnant woman here ! A baby is being born ! " Instead I opened the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hand . " You get in first , " I would tell Jeremy . He always had this moment of hesitation just then , but when I gave him a pat he would climb on in . Mary laid her cheek against mine , leaning across a whole table 's width of stomach and overnightcase , which made us laugh . We would have laughed at anything , I believe . Mary glowed all over , lighting up the sidewalk . " Take care of Jeremy for me , " she always whispered . And then , aloud : " I 'm off ! " She climbed into the cab . She rolled down the window and leaned out , waving . " Goodbye , Miss Vinton ! And thank you for getting up ! I 'm off ! Good-bye ! " I bought my little car when my knees grew too rheumatic for bicycling . I chose a ' 5i DeSoto , not much to look at but very steady and reliable . This was when Mary was well into her fourth pregnancy . ( Her fifth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " You can go to the hospital in style this time . Well , maybe not style , exactly , but at least you wo n't have to depend on the Yellow Cab Company . " Secretly I was a little nervous . I must have checked the route to the hospital a dozen times , although it was n't far and I had often been before . I kept reminding Mr. Somerset , " Do n't go anywhere in November . Promise me , please . " He was supposed to watch the children while I was away . Now , Mr. Somerset had not been gone overnight in the fourteen years I 'd known him , so you can see how edgy I must have been . I kept wishingthat Julia Jarrett were still alive . Or that they had replaced her , at least  --  found another grandmotherly type for that room instead of turning it into a nursery . What kind of babysitter was an old man with a fondness for bourbon ? By October ,  |p129before  Mary had even packed her suitcase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bed and put a pair of shoes beneath it , all ready to hop into . I took to sleeping in tomorrow'sunderwear . I kept dreaming that my car ran out of gas halfway to the hospital . But it was mid-November , about four o'clock one morning , when the knock came on my door . I had been expecting it for so long that it hardly seemed real . I ran downstairs still fastening buttons and carrying my belt looped over my wrist , and there was Mary as calm as always , smiling up at me . She had on the blue maternity dress that she 'd worn day in and day out for the majority of her married life , and over that the old black coat that did n't meet across her stomach . " Are you all right ? " I asked her . " I 'm fine . " " How close are the pains ? " " Every four minutes . " " Jeremy had better hurry , " I said . " Oh , he 's not coming . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I stared at her . " Well , I do have you to help , " Mary said . " It 's not as if I have to manage the taxi any more . " " Mary , he would n't want to miss being with you now for all the world , " I told her . If there was one thing I was sure of , that was it . Why , that man would move heaven and earth for her ! You have only to look at him to see how much he loves her . But there stood Mary shaking her head , planted squarely in front of me like little Abbie when she has made up her mind about something . " You do n't know how hard it is for him , " she said . I did know . I probably knew better than she did , but I also believe that everyone has a right to take his own leaps.  |p130Of  course , I did n't tell Mary that . She has her rights too . And there might be other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did was nod and bend to pick up her overnight case . " Suit yourself , " I said . " You got everything ? " " I think so . " " Let 's go , then , " I said . It was n't even necessary to call Mr. Somerset  --  not with Jeremy at home . But I felt that we were making a mistake , all the way to the hospital . Mary did n't , apparently . She just looked out the window and talked about ordinary things  --  the house , the children . I have to admit I was relieved about that . I do n't like hearing too much of people 's personal lives . Sometimes she stopped speaking and her face would flatten and her eyes would get fixed on a point far away . That was the only sign she gave of being in labor . It was n't at all like in the movies , thank God . Then after a minute she would relax and go on with what she was saying before . " I wanted to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not  --  " " I 'll see to it . " " I believe it 's in the trunk . It 's that old one of Abbie 's , you remember . " " Yes , yes . " I had never realized how long some traffic lights can take . " And Darcy needs a note of permission , she 's going on a field trip . " " I 'll write her one in the waiting room . " " But how will you sign it ? How will they know who Miss Vinton is ? " I had assumed I would simply forge Mary 's name , but since that did n't seem to have occurred to her I came up with another answer . " I 'll give it to Jeremy to sign , " I said . " Oh , yes , " Mary said . She turned and looked at me . Why did she suddenly become so beautiful ? The corners of her mouth lifted , and she brushed her hair up off her neck andp131tipped her head back until it rested on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " she said . Then she closed her eyes , and the light changed to green . I nearly stripped all the gears , I was so anxious to get us moving again . At the hospital they whisked Mary away in a wheelchair , and I went into a waiting room I found at the end of the hall . It was huge and barren-looking , with linoleum floors and vinyl furniture and a stiff bouquet of hothouse flowers on a coffee table . On one couch a bald man was stretched out asleep . I took a chair at the other end of the room from him , turned on a lamp , and wrote a note on the back of a shopping list : " To whom it may concern , Darcy Tell has my permission to go on a field trip today . Signed , " and I left a blank space for Jeremy 's signature . Then I sat back and stared at the blank space . I kept wondering if I should just go and phone him . Would n't Mary be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that Jeremy is supposed to be the weak one in that couple but he might surprise some people : if you are so scared of so many things , sometimes you turn out even stronger than ordinary men . I took a dime from my purse , but then I reconsidered . I have n't lived fourteen years on the edges of other people 's lives for nothing . I could never interferelike that . So I stayed in my seat . I spent the next hour chain-smoking and reading torn Life magazines whose photos seemed very dim and long ago , the way they always do in waiting rooms . Then someone said , " Miss Vinton ? " and I looked up to find a doctor dressed in green standing in the doorway . " Are you Miss Vinton ? Mrs. Pauling sent me to tell you , " he said . " She has a boy . " I said , " A boy ? Are you sure ? " Which made him smile , but you ca n't really blame me . The first three babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 'd been planning for an Edward so long that the name was getting stale . I think all of us had given upp132hope . I said , " My , wo n't Jeremy be surprised ? I ca n't wait to tell him ! " but the doctor held up his hand and said , " That was the rest of her message . She 'll call her husband herself , she says . She wants to . " " Oh , of course , " I said . " I did n't think . " I watched him walk off again . Then I looked down at the warm dime in the palm of my hand . Other people save dimes for weeks . They spend hours in the phone booth as soon as the baby is born , telling grandparents and aunts and uncles and friends . Who could I tell ? As far as I knew Jeremy had one solitary sister left from all his family  --  Amanda , who kept her distance . ( She never did get on with Mary . ) I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only friends were the women Mary sat in the park with , behind a row of strollers . I did n't even know their last names and possibly Mary did n't either . So in the end I put the dime away again , and got up to leave . The bald man was still asleep on the couch . I had n't seen a single husband pacing the floor in his shirtsleeves . Things rarely work out the way the magazines would lead you to expect . By the time I got home it was almost light , and the children were up . They keep the most amazing hours . Darcy was in the kitchen fixing cereal for the little ones , Abbie and Pippi were quarreling in the parlor , and Hannah was sitting in her high chair sucking her thumb . " Heavens , " I said to Darcy . " Who 's watching over you ? Where 's everyone else ? " " In bed , I guess , " Darcy said . " Did n't Jeremy tell you you have a baby brother ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a silent age . " Well , you do , " I said . " Well , nobody told us . " " I believe they 're naming him Edward . " " I knew that , " she said . " I 'm the one that chose it . "  |p133I  'd forgotten . They let her choose all the names , to make her feel a part of things . It 's lucky they did n't end up with a pack of Hepzibahs and Lancelots . I said , " Well , I think that 's a very fine choice , Darcy . " " When do we get to see him ? " In a few days . " She poured milk into the cereal bowls and I went out to t he parlor to separate the two who were quarreling . " All right , what 's going on here ? " I said . It was something to do with a pack of bath salts . I put the pack on the mantel , wiped Pippi 's tears , and buttoned Abbie 's pajamas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be the only grownuparound . I still had my mackintosh on . I was stained with tears and pink bath salts , and in two hours I was due at the bookstore . Not that I would have minded staying with the children . I have offered to , for every birth . " Let Jeremy go on with his work , " I always tell Mary . " I 'll take some of my vacation time . " She says , " No , goodness , he can manage . " Now I could n't see a sign of him . I got the two girls seated with their cereal and then I went into the dining room and tapped on Jeremy 's door . He and Mary share his mother 's old room . But there was no answer , and finally I looked inside . All I found was an empty bed , unmade . Bedclothes trailing across the floor . I shut the door and went back to the kitchen . " All right , children , " I said . " It looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed out paper napkins , and fixed them hot cocoa while they sat eating around the kitchen table . They made quite a picture  --  Darcy so blond , the others brown-headed and round-faced and solemn . The younger ones were fairly close together in age  --  six , four , and two  --  and that morning it seemed to me that the littlest was much too little to have a new baby coming in . She was drinking from one of those training cups with a spout . Every time she took the cup out of her mouth she replaced it instantly withp134her thumb . Abbie and Pippi continued to fight . Darcy started bossing them around  --  a bad habit she has . Meanwhile Buddy came through , our current medical student , and grabbed an apple on his way out , and Mr. Somerset appeared but left when he saw the crowd . " Mr. Somerset ! Wait , " I said . " Have you seen Jeremy ? " " Nope . " " I bet you he 's in the studio , " Darcy said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the third floor . I took Darcy 's teacher 's note with me . I held it in front of me , like a ticket of admission , while I knocked . " Jeremy ? It 's Mildred Vinton , " I said . No answer . I knocked again . They put a door on his studio when they moved the first two girls upstairs , to his old bedroom . It used to be that the whole house showed signs of his working , scraps littered everywhere and the smell of glue and construction paper , but the better his pieces get the more he shuts them away from us . Someday , I believe , Jeremy is going to be a very famous man , but it is possible that no one will be allowed to see his work at all by then , not even strangers in museums . I said , " Jeremy ? Are you in there ? " Then I said , " Well , I 'm not going to disturb you , but I do have to know if you 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaked across the floor . The door opened and there stood Jeremy , unshaven , in a round-necked moth-eaten sweater and a pair of baggy trousers . It was years since I had seen him looking so awful . The funny thing about Jeremy is that he never seems to age , he always has the same smooth plump face , but today that made it all the worse . He looked shocking , like a baby with a hangover . However , I pretended not to notice . " Morning , Jeremy , " I said . " Congratulations . " " Thank you , Miss Vinton . " When we heard they were married ( and after we got over the surprise ) , and the house warmed up and we started usingp135first names more , I asked them to call me Mildred but apparentlythat proved impossible . I am doomed to be Miss Vinton forever . I stuck out my note , along with a ballpoint pen . " Could you sign this , please ? " He signed , but without even reading it so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did n't call me , " he said . " Well , I  --  she asked me not to , Jeremy . " " She did n't even want me with her . " I could n't think what to say . I looked off down the stairs , so as not to embarrass him . Finally I asked , " Would you like me to take care of the children today ? " " You think that I 'm not up to it , " he said . He startled me . I said , " Why , no , Jeremy , I know you are . " " I can do things like that . " " Of course , but  --  if you 're working on something . " " I 'm not working on anything at all . " He shut the door again . What could I do ? It seemed he was too abstracted for me to leave the little girls with him , but in the end that 's what I did  --  bathed and dressed and went off to the shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I called . The phone rang seven times before he answered . " Jeremy ? " I said . " Is everything all right ? " " Why , yes . " His voice sounded more like himself , and I could hear Pippi singing in the background . It seemed I had worried for no good reason . In the afternoon I took off from work early and went to visit Mary . As you can imagine , I was an old hand at hospital visits by that time . I knew enough not to bring her flowers ( extravagance makes her anxious ) and to stop off at the nursery first so that I could tell her I 'd seen the baby . ( She always has me promise that everything is fine , no doctor has drawn me aside to whisper anything dire . ) After I had lookedp136at Edward a proper length of time I went down the hall to her ward , where I expected to find her chattering and smiling the way she always was after a baby , but she was n't that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All up and down the room were women with bows in their hair and lace on their bedjackets , talking softly to their husbands , and there was Mary crying . Well , I nearly left . I would have , if I could . When people cry I back off to give them privacy . But then ! ' f she saw me and I was trapped . " Oh , Miss Vinton , " she said . She sat up quickly and darted her index fingers underneath her eyes , getting rid of the evidence . I pretended not to notice . " Got quite a son there , " I said . I wished I had brought flowers . Then I would have had something to fuss over , give her time to get her bearings . I said , " Were you asleep ? BecauseI only stopped in for a moment . Was n't planning to stay . I 'll be back at the next  --  " " I 've upset Jeremy , " she said . " Oh . Well , I 'm sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I should have told him . " " I really do n't know much about such things , " I said . " I 'm sure it will all get straight in the end . " " I thought I was helping . All I did was hurt his feelings sobadly I do n't know what he 'll do . I 've never seen him so hurt . I called him and  --  " Then she started crying again . She could n't even talk . I said , " Oh , well . Oh , well . " I spent a long time getting my mackintosh unbuttoned and draping it just so over the back of a chair . " I called , " Mary said , getting hold of her voice , " and I told him  --  and he waited a long time and then he said , I see . ' Then he  --  then  --  " Her voice gave way . I felt helpless . I just knew she would lie awake hating herself for exposing her secrets this way . Could I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then he said , Did n't you want me with you , Mary ? ' " " Well , of course you did , " I said , pulling down my sweater cuffs very carefully . " I tried to make him see . I always want you with me , Jeremy , ' I said , but it 's not as if this is my first baby after all and I know how hard it is for you to  --  ' " Honesty : her one fault . There is such a thing as seeing too deeply , and then telling a man too much of what you see , but I do n't know when she 's going to find that out . " Look , " I wanted to say , " the biggest favor you can do for him is to take him at face value . " But I managed to keep quiet . I just handed her the tissue box and watched her blotting her tears . " This is a postnatal depression , I believe , " I told her finally . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back later ? " I said . " No , Miss Vinton , do n't go . Please do n't go . I promise I 'll stop this . " It seemed unlikely that she would keep her promise , but I could n't think of any decent way to get out of the room . I settled back in my chair . " Now , I 've been to see the baby , " I told her . " Seems quite healthy , I 'd say from the looks of him . " " Did you see him , Miss Vinton ? " " I told you . I 've just been by the nursery . " " I meant Jeremy . Did you see him ? " " Yes , this morning I did . " " How did he look ? Was he all right ? " " He was fine , " I told her . " Just fine . " " They wo n't let me use the phone again until I 'm up and about , " Mary said , " and that wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . All I want to do is ask how the children are , and get this misunderstanding straightened out . I ca n't stand just lying here thinking that  --  " " The children are managing beautifully , " I said . " Are they doing what he tells them to ? "  | " Of course . " " He does n't always know quite how to handle them , you see , and I worry that  --  " " They 're fine , " I told her . " He said he wanted to come visit me . " " Oh , good , good , " I said . I thought that was a wonderful sign ; before he had always left the visiting to me . " I told him not to . " " Mary Pauling ! Why ever not ? " " It 's so hard for him , " Mary said . " I told him not to bother . " Some people take a terribly long time learning things . I went home and found everything in chaos  --  Buddy cooking spaghetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet with an old bent broom . There is something so pathetic about men trying to figure out the way a house works . " Here , " I said to Jeremy , " let me do that . " He had laid a clean diaper on the floor but he seemed to be havingtrouble getting Hannah to set herself down on it . I said , " At eight o'clock it will be visiting hour at the hospital . I 'll stay with the children while you go . " " She does n't want me to , " he said . He looked at me with his eyes very wide and steady . It nearly broke my heart . " Jeremy , " I said , " are you sure she does n't ? " " She asked me not to come . " Then Hannah started wandering off toward a stack of blocks . I grabbed her . " Now listen , young lady , " I said , " this has gone far enough , do you hear ? " Only Hannah , of course , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult to live among people you love and hold back from offering them advice . I have never been married and never planned to be , never had the inclination to be . Yet I do n't believe I am an unhappyp139person . I had a normal childhood , good parents , five fine brothers and sisters . I had the usual number of young men to come calling when I was the proper age . Still , I did not once consider the possibility of marrying any of them . If you were to ask my vision of the future back then , my favorite daydream , it was this : I would be reading a book alone in my room , and no one would ever , ever interrupt me . I realize how antisocial that sounds . But it seemed to me that my life was so crowded , when I was young . There were always so many people around . Everyone knew everyone 's secrets . And then later , when my father died and my brothers and sisters married and moved away , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness . I chose to ; it was n't a case of the put-upon spinster daughter . And my mother was never one of those querulous old ladies . She was kind and cheerful , right to the end . But the sharing we did ! The five years of meals shared , house shared , news shared , plans and worries and money problems , even the plots of hooks shared . I knew everythingabout her , because I had to : the state of her bowels and the foods that disagreed with her and the thoughts that kept her awake nights . And she knew about me because there was no escaping me ; I was perpetually with her . Toward the end I even slept on a cot in her bedroom . When she died I was awakened merely by the silence  --  the stopping of a breath that I had lived with continually for five long years . Solitude shocked my eyes open . I was alone . I went through her funeral fully composed , and the only thing that disturbed me was the noise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gathered for the occasion . " Oh , Mildred , " they said , " we know how you feel : you ca n't believe it yet . " That was how they explained my not crying . Then Carrie , the sister closest to me , said , " I guess it must be almost a relief to you , her going . None of us would be shocked to hear it . " But it was n't the kind of relief she meant . I was n't relievedp140to be free , or to be rid of the work ; I was relieved to have my privacy . If you were to shake me awake in the middle of the night and say , " Quick , without thinking : What is the most important thing in the world ? " I would say , " Privacy . " I know that 's not right ; you do n't have to tell me . I know that the true answer is probably love , or understanding , or feeling needed  --  even for me . But I am telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privacy . Sitting alone in a room reading a book , with no one to interrupt me . That is all I ever consciously wanted out of life . When I first came here , immediately after Mother died , I announced my requirements from the doorstep . " I see you let rooms , " I said . " I 'd like one that 's cheap and quiet . No noise , no people in large numbers . Can you provide that ? " At the time , I had no way of knowing that everything I said was unnecessary . Jeremy Pauling and his mother were more private than I had ever thought it possible to be . That front door might as well have had a curtain of cobwebs across it , like the Sleeping Beauty 's palace gate , with the two of them inside trying to make as little noise as possible and the rest of the world outside  --  some large cold frightening force waiting to pounce , something certain to win , superior to them in every way . Mrs. Pauling , going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how hot the weather was , as if she wished for armor . She stopped outside the house and looked all around her with a timid blue startled gaze , checking on what the enemy had in mind for her . She returned pushing a wire tote cart so packed with non-perishables that it seemed she was expecting a siege , and she would scurry inside with them and line them up in rows in her cupboards and then stand back to stare at them a long time , moving her lips as if counting . After one of those trips she might not go to the store again for weeks  --  or anywhere else , except church occasionally . She and Jeremy stayed inside and drank hot cocoa.  |p141Was  there any other door in the world so suitable for me to knock upon ? Originally I was going to live here only a few months , until I found a job and had saved the money for an apartment . Then I could be truly alone . But the years passed and I just never got around to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like it here . If you want my opinion , our whole society would be better off living in boarding houses . I mean even families , even married couples . Everyone should have his single room with a door that locks , and then a larger room downstairs where people can mingle or not as they please . For I do like some people . I 'm no hermit . I like to watch Jeremy 's and Mary 's children growing up , and the medical students turning into doctors , and Mr. Somerset shuffling through his pension . For such a good life , is n't it fair that I should have to pay some price ? The price is silence . Keeping silent when I am moved to speak , staying out of other people 's affairs , holding back my advice , giving them the privacy I have asked for myself . Often I wonder if I am making a mistake . I think : Am I missing something ? Have I forfeited too much ? Is there a time when people I love might not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climb the stairs to my room . I turn the key in the lock . One sad thing about this world is that the acts that take the most out of you are usually the ones that other people will never know about . Mary stayed in the hospital five days , and believe me those were five mighty long days . At home the disorder grew worse , and the children got cranky and the house did n't feel right any more . Daytimes Jeremy pottered around looking helpless ; nights he worked in his studio till nearly dawn , and came to breakfast so tired and pale he could hardly speak . He never did go to the hospital . I went . I went every afternoon and every evening and watched Mary cry . Oh , I do n't mean that 's all she did . She had her cheerful moments , particularly whenp142she 'd just been with the baby . She made friends with the mothers in her ward , she received other visitors ( Buddy , Buddy 's girlfriend , a few of the women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote little notes for me to take home to the children . But at least once on every visit she would break down and cry . " Oh , why ca n't I just go home to him ? " she said once , and then , " Do you think I should n't have had this baby ? " One evening she was telling me why she 'd wanted such a big family . " I was an only child , " she said ( the first mention she had ever made to me of any kind of past ) , " and I always promised myself I would have at least a dozen children when I grew up . Well , I 'm keeping my promise , are n't I ? " Then her eyes glazed over with tears . I was n't at all prepared , right then . " But sometimes , " she said , " I feel that every new baby is another rope , tying me down like a tent . I do n't have the option to leave any more . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hush , now , my goodness , " I said . " I love him more than I ever loved anyone , do you believe me ? But sometimes I start falling in love with my doctor or even the children 's doctor , they 're both so sure of what they 're doing . Even the furnace man , who knows exactly where the leak is , or the man who delivers my groceries . He whistles cheerful songs and slams that big box of groceries on my kitchen table . " " You 're just upset , " I said . I went home upset myself , and lay awake hoping that she would forget she had ever told me such things . In the beginning , when they were first married , she asked so much of him . It was plain that she did n't realize he was different from anybody else . " Come with me to pick out curtains , " I heard her say once . And another time , " Why do n't we ever go to movies , Jeremy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Julia Jarrett always believed that for Mary 's sake he would change , and you might say that in a sense he did . He does go out more now . Why , presumably he had to go off this block for his wedding , and then there were those trips to the hospital and three years ago he went to Darcy 's school to see her play a flower in Red Riding Hood 's forest . ( She gave Red Riding Hood a warning in a silvery little voice  --  I was there . " Be careful , little girl , remember what your mother told you . " Jeremy walked seven blocks to hear that and applauded all alone the minute she said her line , which naturally made Darcy furious . But I admired him for that . There are other kinds of heroes than the ones who swim through burning oil . ) But no , he has never gone to Hecht 's to pick out curtains . He has never taken Mary to a movie . How does she explain that to herself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he never would ? I really have no idea . All I can say is that bit by bit , it seemed she stopped askinghim . It seemed she grew quieter , older , stronger . There was something more loving in the way she treated him . Then I heard her talking with Buddy , back before he knew us well . He was telling her about a play that she and Jeremy should n't miss . " Oh , " she said , " Jeremy has nearly stopped going to plays . His eyes have been bothering him . " And I knew the pieces had finally fallen into place for her , she had stopped expecting him to be like other people . Still I worried . I realized , of course , that it was none of my business . Yet I was so anxious for Jeremy , so quick to imagine him in all possible scenes of failure with her . During the first few weeks of their marriage I sent her silent , invisible messages : If you are unkindit will be a sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that this is a very special man you are dealing with . A genius . Not some run-of-the-mill insurance salesman . It was n't that I disliked her , you see ; I was fond of her even that far back . But in some ways Mary is an everyday kind of woman ,  |p144and  this marriage was as odd for her , as distant from her main road , as it was for Jeremy . Look at the telephone pad in the hall ! Her doodles are minute line drawings of steam irons and tricycles and Mixmasters . She adds to their incomes by sendinghousehold hints to ladies ' magazines . Is it any wonder I worried ? All for nothing , as it turned out . She remained her serene and contented self , while Jeremy seemed ready to burst out of his skin with pride and happiness . I remember one morning she wore a new dress to breakfast , practically the only one I have ever seen her in . She looked just beautiful . I said , " My , that 's attractive . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mood he gets when he is about to start a new piece  --  a thousand miles away . He gave her a wide , blank smile and said nothing . I said , " Jeremy ? Does n't Mary look pretty ? " Becausenow it seemed he had to answer , for Mary 's sake . Jeremy said , " What ? " He stood up and left . Now , a thing like that can seem important to some women . But when I looked over at Mary I saw that she was laughing , and she said , " Do n't worry , he loves it . I know because last week he cut a patch from inside the hem and used it for one of his pieces . He thought I would n't notice . " I was so relieved when I heard that . I thought , " Well , at least she understands him . " I never dreamed she would grow to be too understanding . On Thursday evening Brian came by for Jeremy 's new batch of work . Brian 's visits are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so impressive , in the first place  --  a handsome kindfacedman with a square-cut beard  --  and then too it is always the first glimpse we have of what Jeremy has been up to lately . The things they brought down that night were the best I 'd yet seen . It 's strange how over the years Jeremy 's pieces have grown up . I mean physically , literally . They have doubled in size , and they are so deeply textured that they are almostp145sculptures . Ordinary objects are crowded into them  --  Dixie cups and bus tickets and his children 's plaid shoelaces , still recognizable  --  and his subjects are ordinary too , the smallest and most unnoticed scenes on earth . I found a man with a rake , a woman ironing a shirt , a child strapping on a roller skate . Their features were gone and they were bare of detail ; they were layered over with the Dixie cups and the bus tickets . They made me sad . Have you ever seen a television show that ends with stills from the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles roll over them . The effect is of distance . Momentsthat you just witnessed are suspended forever while you yourself recede from them with every breath you take . The moments grow smaller , and yet clearer . You see some sorrow in them you had never before suspected . Now , does it make any sense when I say that Jeremy 's pieces affect me in the same way ? This man with the rake , slightly stooped and motionless , reminded me that life is nothing but motion and passes too swiftly for us to observe with the naked eye . At least , for me to observe . Jeremy has no trouble whatsoever . He sees from a distance at all times , without trying , even trying not to . It is his condition . He lives at a distance . He makes pictures the way other men make maps  --  setting down the few fixed points that he knows , hoping they will guide him as he goes floating through this unfamiliar planet . He keeps his eyes on the horizon while his hands work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Surely Brian never has . Brian merely tapped the pictures with his knuckles and nodded , chewing his pipe . " Good work , good work , " he said . Then he went on to talk about a boat he had bought . " In the spring I 'm going to try a real trip on her , " he said . " I 'm going to do it old style . I 'll eat what I catch , I 'll sail by celestial navigation . " Jeremy listened with his eyes wide , his expression awed and admiring . He stood beside his very best piece and forgot it utterly . Oh ,  |p146Jeremy  , I wanted to tell him , you too sail by celestial navigationand it is far more celestial than Brian 's . But , of course , I did n't say it out loud . On Friday I went to visit Mary and she said they were letting her come home Saturday . She did n't seem as happy as you 'd expect . " Why , that 's wonderful ! " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll drive everybody over at ten o'clock or so , shall I ? " " Oh well , " Mary said , " this time I think you might just come by yourself if you do n't mind . " " What , alone ? " " It 's simpler that way . " " Who asked it to be simple ? " I said . Ordinarily I would n't have spoken out like that , but I could tell this new arrangement was n't really what she wanted . She was twining a wisp of hair very slowly around her fingers and not meeting my eyes when she spoke . She looked limp and uncombed . " Look , " I told her . " There 's no law that says you ca n't change your mind . Call him up . Tell him you want him to come for you after all . " " I never told him I did n't want him to come , " she said . " Then what 's all this about ? " " I 've been waiting for him to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be hard for him to offer . " " I mean that he wo n't even speak to me on the phone . " " He wo n't ? " I said . I had n't realized that . " When I telephone , one of the children always answers , and if I ask to speak to him they go off to call him and come back and say he 's in the middle of changing Hannah or frying eggs or something . He 's angry . " Jeremy angry ? " No , he 's hurt , Mary , " I said . " Well , I 'm hurt too . I 've been waiting all this time , thinkingp147surely he would give in and call me . I lie here just for hours . Do n't you think I would say yes like a shot if he called and asked to visit me and take me home ? " " Of course . Yes , I know . But you could call , Mary . " " I spend my life calling ! " Mary said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other women in the ward turned to stare . " It 's always me , " she said more quietly . " Never him . I make the first move every time . I 'm tired . " " Yes , now , I know , " I said , trying to hush her . And after that she did grow more reasonable . For the rest of the hour we talked about ordinary things . But when finally I rose to go , when I turned in the doorway to say goodbye , the last thing I saw was Mary sitting with her hands folded and her eyes lowered and her face sad and wistful . She reminded me of a girl waiting for an invitation to dance . Even her lace-trimmed nightgown had a pathetic look , like a ball dress carefully ironed by some loving mother who had imagined her daughter waltzing all evening , and never dreamed it could be otherwise . For bringing home a new baby there is a ritual in this house , and I am part of it . I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Jeremy is inside the hospital . We are all packed into the back seat , and up front the driver is grumbling over the noise and the crowding and the cracker crumbs . While we wait I take the children to a concrete space beneath Mary 's window . I point it out to them . " See ? There it is  --  the one with the shade pulled all the way up . " " Where ? Where ? " When all the children have located it , they start shouting . " Mama ! " they call  --  even the littlest one . It is against our rules for Mary to be watching for us . She must stay out of sight , and wait to hear their voices . Then she comes to the window . Dressed , finally , all set to go . First she waves and blows kisses , then she play-acts her impatience to come down . She pounds silently on the windowpane , she sets her fist against her fore/head . The children laugh , too shrilly . They sound a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , this may be exactly how they have imagined her absence : they suspect she is being kept prisoner somewhere , forced to leave them in the fumbling care of their father . For she would never desert them of her own free will , would she ? Then another face appears beside hers  --  Jeremy 's , round and blurred . Mary flings up her hands in joy , showing that the rescue squad has at last arrived . She turns and throws her arms around his neck . The two of them are framed in the window like heroes at the end of a romantic movie  --  wrapped together , touched with sunlight . We go back to the taxi . This will be our longest wait , while they collect the new baby and settle the bill . To pass the time we play " I Spy , " and we become so absorbed that Darcy is the only one to see her parents emerging . " Ta-taaa ! " she says , like a trumpet . We look up to find them coming across the driveway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She has read somewhere that if it is the father who introducesthe new baby there will be less jealousy , and although I ca n't see what earthly difference it makes she has given the baby to Jeremy . He holds it stiff-armed , at a distance , with his entire self concentrating on getting his prize safely to the car . He reminds me of little Pippi carrying a very full glass of water . " Here we are ! " l/Lary says . Then the taxi is a flurry of hugs and kisses , and the baby is passed from one grimy set of hands to another . Even the taxi driver must have a turn ; no one will be satisfied until he does . " Well now , " he says . " Yes sir . What do you know . " He gives it back , grins and shakes his head , and starts the motor . The ceremony is over . All requirementshave been met . The rules are stashed in the back of our minds until two years from now . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't realize the ritual could be abandoned so easily.  |p149Early  Saturday I went to the dimestore and chose a small toy for Mary to bring each of the children . Usually she tells me exactly what they have been wanting , but this time she did n't seem to know . " Oh , anything , " she said . " You probably have better ideas than I do . " I entered the dimestore feeling uncertain  --  Ihad no ideas at all  --  but then I began to enjoy myself . I had been watching those children more closely than I suspected . I knew that Darcy would like something she could do with her hands  --  an embroidery set  --  and that Abbie had a yen for costume jewelry . The jewelry on the toy counter was not very satisfying . All I saw were pop-it beads and plastic bangles . But then in the grownups ' section I found a wealth of glittery rhinestones and great multicolored teardrop earrings . They were more expensive , but I could always chip in a little money of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had discoveredthem in a pirates ' chest . Who else would think of looking here for a child 's gift ? I chose green glass earrings shaped like peacock tails and purple ones like huge bunches of grapes . I held one of each to my ears and looked in the mirrorthat sat on the countertop . Then I froze , with jewels dangling ridiculously below my great long earlobes . For there I was , against a background of crepe-paper turkeys and pilgrim-shaped candles and sheaves of plastic Indian corn : my bony face all lit up and feverish and my pupils enormous and my fingers a little shaky , clutching those earrings . Like some tacky trite cartoon : old maid preparing for the arrival of the troops , or waiting for the meter man . Only it was n't any soldier or meter man that had lit my eyes so ; it was the prospect of what I was going to do today . Choose the children 's surprises on my own , check Mary out of the hospital , carry that new baby home the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself carrying him ! It was as if , without realizing it , I had spent all of the night before imagining every detail ! I saw myself climbing the front steps holding the baby exactly right ( much better than Jeremy would have , much more securely ) . I saw the children crowding around me , all anxious to share my treasure . I saw myself dispensing gifts . " Open that bag , will you , Darcy ? See what you find . There are surprises there for all of you , I chose them myself . " They would scatter brown paper bags and cash register slips , all excited over gifts I had selected that Mary would never have thought of . Mary faded . Jeremy faded . I was left alone with that baby wrapped in powder blue and that circle of little faces . I picked three toys in haste and went directly home . In the front hall I found Pippi , wearing frayed underpants and nothing else . She was shivering . Tears had made little gray streamers down her cheeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I gave her a pat on the head and walked on by . I went straight to the kitchen , where I found Jeremy trying to get Hannah to eat her egg . That was what he had been doing when I left , an hour ago . Hannah was in her high chair with her lips clamped together , and Jeremy was saying , " Please , Hannah . Wo n't you consider taking another bite ? " " Jeremy , here are some things I 'd like you to give Mary , " I told him . I set my shopping bag on a chair . Jeremy looked up quickly . " Me ? " he said . " I wo n't be going to the hospital , but I 'll be happy to stay with the children . " Jeremy set the spoonful of egg down and opened the bag , as if he expected to find some answer inside it . " E-Z-Do Embroidery Set , " he said . " Hush , it 's supposed to be a surprise . " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have I  --  is there something the matter , Miss Vinton ? " " Nothing 's the matter . " " I had thought perhaps Mary wanted you to bring her home . " " No , I think she would prefer you to do it . "  |p151I-Ie  started smiling . He nodded several times and his face grew pink . " Oh , well , then , certainly , " he said . " Thank you , Miss Vinton ! I certainly do  --  " " Any time , " I said . " Here , give me that , " and I reached for Hannah 's bowl of egg . " Now you 'd better hurry . She was due to be released at ten and it 's already five of . " " Oh yes , " Jeremy said . He rose and held out his hand . For a moment I could n't think why , but then I saw that he was beaming at me and I set the bowl on the table and shook his hand . " It 's certainly  --  it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I really do n't know how to  --  " " Oh shoot . Run along , now . " He picked up the bag of gifts , which I had forgotten all about , and left the kitchen . I heard him in the hallway , scatteringhangers and stumbling over rubber boots in the coat closet . A minute later I heard the front door slam . " Where 's he going ? " Darcy said , coming into the kitchen . " I thought you were off getting Mom . " " Jeremy 's doing that , " I told her . " He is ? Then ca n't we all go too ? " " Not this time . " " But Miss Vinton ! We always used to ! " " That 's no reason to keep on doing a thing , is it ? " I said . I lifted Hannah out of her high chair and then I went into the parlor , to the front bay window . The lace curtains hid me . I watched Jeremy for as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumpy man holding a paper bag . He leaned forward from time to time and looked for a taxi , first in one direction and then the other ( although we live on a one-way street ) . He kept shifting the bag higher on his stomach . He wore no coat or jacket , nothing but his gray tweed golf cap and that sleazy sweater he had been in all week , but I held back from rushing out to him with an armload of wraps . Then a taxi stopped for him , but instead of getting inp152immediately , Jeremy turned and looked back at the house . His face was so open , so happy and hopeful . I saw him take in a breath , maybe planning to call out something . Yet I know that he could n't see me . I stayed far back in the room . Finally he climbed into the taxi , and I sat down on the windowseat and reached for Pippi . " You think she hit just a little , " Pippi said . " But she hit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I know , I know , " I said , barely listening . I put her on my lap and set my face against her head . Her hair had a clean sharp smell . I took a breath of it and felt it fill me like an ache , and I closed my eyes and held on to her for as long as she would allow . Darcy made a poster : WELCOME EDWARD . We Scotchtapedit to the window . The four girls sat beneath it , freshly dressed and combed , making four steamy o 's on the glass . Then Abbie said , " Here they are ! Here they come ! " The taxi pulled up , the door opened , out stepped Mary . After her came Jeremy , with the baby in his arms . " See , how little ? " I said , but I was talking to an empty room . The children were alreadyfighting their way to the door . " I open it , because I 'm the oldest , " Darcy said , but Abbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hush ! " I called . They paid me no attention . I stood alone at the window and smiled down at Jeremy and Mary , who came up the walk side by side , laughing , surrounded by a sea of bobbing heads and small hands waving in celebration.  | " I have something to tell you , " Mary said . " Jeremy ? Are you listening ? " He was n't . He was making a statue . He stood before a circle of tin children , waist-high ; he wrung his hands . Like a man in a well , he heard Mary 's voice only dimly . It was necessary to find red . Where was the right red ? But then he detected some urgency in what she said , something different from theMuzak of her discussions of washing machines , report cards , DPT shots . " What ? " he said . He struggled up from under layers and layers of thought . There was a dry feeling at the hack of his throat , as if he had been buried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , instead , the exact shade of red he needed  --  very bright , a little fuzzy . It seemed familiar . He turned away from her and dumped out a carton of scraps . Nothing there . He went across the room nearly at a run , bentkneed . He flung open shelves and pulled out drawers and turned over a wastebasket . There was a red lace heart and ap154red geometric design from a magazine and a piece of red constructionpaper that smelled like the inside of his grammar school forty years ago . He held the paper to his nose and closed his eyes and took a deep breath . Now children 's voices came singing through his head , over all those decades : She 'll be wearing red pajamas when she comes , ( Scratch , scratch ) She 'll be wearing .. . Red flannel . He saw it clearly now . He even saw the microscopicdots of lint left from laundering . He plowed through the wastepaper and out of the door , across the hall to the girls ' room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? You said you would n't use their things any more , you promised ! " " I 'll get them new ones , " Jeremy said . " New what ? What are you looking for ? You always say that , Jeremy . " He paused in the middle of a drawer , up to his elbows in pink and white . " Where are their red pajamas ? " he asked . " What red pajamas ? " " Do n't children wear red pajamas any more ? " They never had any red pajamas . " He straightened up from the drawer and went over to the closet . Scattered across the floor were dirty socks , blouses , stuffed animals  --  you would think that somewhere in here would be a tiny piece of red flannel . He opened the closet door and scanned a rack of dresses , all different sizes and colors . " I have something I want to tell you , " Mary said . Like a string pulling him , some strong piece of twine pullinghim away from the picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red flannel had dissolved and the circle of children had stopped spinning , dropped their hands , and crumbled away . He opened his mouth to protest but saw , sud/denly , how the curve of her cheek fitted so exactly to the curve of Rachel 's head  --  the latest baby , nestled into her mother 's neck like a piece in a jigsaw puzzle . Mary 's hair had come undone and was tumbling down her back , lit by the sun in the window . The three faint lines beginning at the corner of each eye were lit as well , radiating as precisely as a cat 's whiskers , giving her a look of constant , gentle puzzlement . " What is it , Mary ? " he asked . " Are you really listening to me ? " " Yes , yes . " But up came the sound of feet , pounding on the stairs . An interruption to the interruption . Was this how life progressed ? I f he traced his way back through the chain of interruptions , looking for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he find himself ten years in the past ? In came Pippi , out of breath . " Mom ? Where 's Mom ? " " Why , here she is , " said Jeremy . " Guess what , Mom ? " Mary 's face took on that change that always happened when her children spoke . She bent her head , her eyes grew instantlyopaque with concentration and every muscle seemed tensed to listen . " Some men are bringing in a refrigerator , " Pippi told her . " A refrigerator ? " " They say Jeremy won it in a contest . " Mary raised her head and looked at him . " You should have let me know , " she said . " But I  --  how could I ? This is the first I 've heard of it . " " They say he got a letter , " said Pippi . " Oh , Jeremy . Are you not opening letters again ? " " Why , I thought I was . I ca n't imagine what  --  " " They say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All right , I 'm coming . " She descended the steps without hurry , unruffled as ever ,  |p156behind  Pippi 's clattering shoes . Rachel 's face bobbed over her shoulder . Jeremy followed , wiping his hands on his trousers . He felt pulled in too many directions . Pieces of the statue still crowded his mind along with Mary 's listening face , the thunderof furniture moving downstairs , the news she had never managed to tell him . " Um , Mary , " he said , " ca n't they take it back again ? This house is getting so full . We surely do n't need another refrigerator . " " Oh , that 's all right , Jeremy , we 'll put it in the basement . " " We put the last one in the basement . " " Well ? There 's still room . You know how much food this family eats . " " But it feels so cluttered , " Jeremy said . " Mary , there are so many things in this house . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two men in leather jackets were rolling an enormous pink refrigerator along a path they had cleared through the parlor , steering their way between rocking chairs and tricycles and hordes of children . " Look ! " said Mary . " It 's a side-by-side refrigerator-freezer , the kind I 've always wanted . " " Kitchen ? " said one of the men . " No  --  well , yes , why not . Then we 'll send the old one down to the basement . Could you move the old one first ? " " Look , we ai n't moving men . " " I 'll pay you , " Mary said . " Five dollars is what we would ask for it . " " Jeremy ? " Everyone looked at him . He felt embarrassed , as if he were there under false pretences . He was n't the one who handled the money . " Well , actually , " he said , " I do n't believe we want this item . " " Jeremy ! " " You should 've told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All we do is deliver them , like they ask us to . "  | " It appears I must have mislaid the letter . Actually I  --  we have two refrigerators . " " What you go and enter the contest for , then ? " " I thought I might win money , " Jeremy said . " Jeremy , you know we can use another refrigerator , " Mary told him . " Especially for this summer , when watermelons come in . Leave the gentlemen alone , Hannah . And you know the boarders need shelves of their own , they do n't want to get " Do we move it or do n't we , lady ? " " Yes ! " said the children , and jumped up and down , and clapped , and made Jeremy 's head ache . Mary said , " Of course you do . Empty the old one , will you , children ? Everybody help ; just put the food on the counter . " She herded them into the kitchen and Jeremy followed . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched from the doorway while children stacked endless cartons of milk on the drainhoard , relayed heads of lettuce to the table , tossed an arc of oranges across the room . " Quite a family you got there , " a delivery man said behind him . Jeremy smiled too widely and ducked his head . Did anyone guess how his children baffled him ? He did n't understand them . He had trouble talking to them . All he could do was watch : drink them in with such speechless , openmouthedamazement that he was accused of being off in a ( laze . Mary watched too , but for different reasons . She was checking for danger and germs and mischief ; she was their armed guard . What Jeremy was doing was committing them to memory , preparing for some moment far in the future when he could sit down alone and finally figure them out . He knew the exact curl of Abbie 's eyes when she laughed , the way I Iannah rubbed the down on her upper lip when she sucked her thumb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to him that all of his children were miniature Marys.  |p158He  could find no physical resemblance to himself . He thought that was natural , for Mary 's pregnancies appeared to be entirelyher own undertakings . It was she who discovered and announced them , took her calcium tablets , disappeared behind those closed swinging doors at the hospital to give birth . But then he looked at Darcy  --  still blond and blue-eyed , nearly as tall as her mother now but with someone else 's frail bones . Her father had not been eclipsed . Her father 's genes must have been as recessive as Jeremy 's , all pale and slight ; yet they had won out . How come ? He turned a puzzled stare on his own children , brown-headed and dark-eyed . He watched his son Edward , who at two and a half wore faded Levis dangling below the pot of his stomach and little cowboy boots . He had not known they made boots as small as that . He had never had boots when he was a boy ; and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them with that jaunty swagger or how to hook his thumbs through the belt loops of his Levi 's . Where had Edward learned ? Where had all of them learned to march so fearlessly across the teeming streets , to brave their way through the city schools , and shout and cheer and throw oranges without a trace of self-consciousness ? Sometimes he said , " Do n't you think we should see to their last names ? " " They have last names , " said Mary . " Yours . It 's on their birth certificates . " " Yes , but if anyone were to check or anything . If they asked for proof . " " Why should they do that ? " " Yes , well . " He had the feeling that the children were some new type of boarder , just louder and more troublesome . They were not entirely of this house , they were visitors from the outside world . When he was most deeply absorbed in his work , childrencame seeping up the stairs like the rising waters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the unbearablepitch of their quarrels  --  would soak into him slowly , at first unnoticed , then so exasperating that he would fling down his scissors and throw open the door and stand there trembling . " Why are you doing this to me ? " he would ask . " Why must you make this noise ? Why do you keep , why do you  --  " Their faces would all be turned up to him . There was something pathetic and yet irritating about their fallen socks , their patched jeans , the damp gray underpants drooping beneathsome little one 's dress . They were utterly silent . Silence brought Mary more quickly than any shriek could . She was there in an instant , running up the stairs already asking , " What is it ? What 's happened ? " " Mary , I was just trying to do some work here  --  " " Yes , all right . Come on , children , Jeremy 's working . " " It 's just that they keep making so much noise , you see . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them . " I knowwhat . Shall we make cookies ? " I'here was no way to win . He felt depressed at the way she herded them down the stairs , shielding them from him with her back ; he felt lonely and guilty now that the third floor was silent again . How could he have scolded them like that ? He knew them so little , could n't he have let them stay a while ? He looked around the hall and saw the traces they had left behind  --  one roller skate , a homemade doll , a chalky handprinton the newel post . At his feet was a paper covered with purple writing : HANNAH 4 YR OLD I AM HANNAH . A fire engine with a key in its back wound itself down , its little red light blinking more and more slowly and the sound of its engine growing weaker . Now a child tossed him an orange and he caught it by accident , astonishing himself so much that he dropped it again . He fell in with a parade that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dank and smelled of mildew . The basement walls were lined with case lots of Mary 's household goods . There was an entire cabinet of sneakers , waiting to be grown into . Another of toilet paper . A barrel of detergent big enough to hold two children . Was this necessary ? He felt that she was pointing something out to him : her role as supplier , feeder , caretaker . " See how I give ? And how I keep on giving  --  these are my reserves . I will always have more , you do n't even have to ask . I will be waiting with a new shirt for you the minute the elbows wear through in the old one . " A delivery man knocked over a stack of flowerpots , bought on sale in preparation for spring . Somebodystepped on a cat . " Damn it all , " said the other man , " will you please get those kids of yours out of here ? Will you get them out ? They ai n't giving us room to step . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corners . The men went upstairs to bring in the new refrigeratorand Mary followed , giving instructions . Jeremy came last . He felt old and tired . By the time he reached the kitchen , puffing and wiping his forehead , the refrigerator was already moving into place . It stuck out too far into the middle of the room and it blocked four inches of doorway . " Is n't it too big ? " said Jeremy . " Mary , I feel so  --  it seems so crowded here . " But Mary said , " You 'll get used to it . " Then she turned and smiled , and in front of everyone she threw her arms around him and said , " Oh , Jeremy , do n't be a grump . Is n't it nice that you keep winning us things ? Are n't you glad you 're so lucky ? " With people watching he could n't hug her back , but he smiled so widely that it seemed his face was melting . He and Mary went to the gallery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Miss Vinton 's car . Mary drove . She wore a hat , also Miss Vinton 's , the first Jeremy had ever seenp161her in . Jeremy wore his golf cap . He was feeling a little sick . He held tight to the edge of the seat every time they turned a corner , and he kept swallowing . " How are you , Jeremy ? " Mary said . " Oh , fine , fine . " " It is n't far now . " She had been to the gallery before . She had been visiting it for years , checking on how his pieces were arranged every time Brian took in a new batch . But Jeremy had never set foot in it , and only the importance of this occasion  --  an entire show devoted only to him , already bringing in more money and comment than he had ever imagined  --  made it impossible for him to refuse to go . Not that he had n't tried . " I 've seen it , " he said . " It 's my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But they left him no escape . Mary and Brian and the others had set things up among them . Miss Vinton lent her car ; the boarder Olivia babysat . Mary said , " We 'll go on a weekday when the place is not packed , " and Brian said , " No one will know you , Jeremy . And you might even learn something ! It 's been years since you last saw some of your pieces . " That was the argument that won Jeremy over . He thought of all the work he had produced  --  objects he had looked at for so long that he could n't see them anymore , things that had worn him out and sickened him until he handed them to Brian merely to get rid of them , to free himself to go on to something new . What would they look like now ? So here he was , in Miss Vinton 's dusty-smelling car on this clear cold afternoon in April , gazing around him at what appeared to be some sort of bomb damage in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but rubble remained . Beyond were caved-in tenements showing yellowed wallpaper , tangles of pipe , crumbled understructures of something like chicken wire . " Mary ? What seems to be the trouble here ? " Jeremy asked . Mary only gave the scene ap162glance . " Oh , they 're rebuilding , " she said , and drove on . Jeremy shrank back further in his corner of the car . He and she looked at different things . They might have been taking two separate rides . " There 's an interesting place , " she said . " It 's a shop for hippies ; they sell tie-dyed denim that would make wonderful curtains for the children 's rooms . " And later , " That 's a new office building without any windows , but they say you do n't notice that once you 're inside . " Sometimesshe explained things to him that he had known for years . Did she imagine he was deaf and blind ? " Look , there 's a girl with a bush . Is n't it amazing ? They call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bushes for years , in magazines and TV commercials and on the sidewalk before the bay window . He had probably seen more from that window than Mary saw on all her trips to stores and schools and obstetricians . He had observed the world steadily swelling and involuting , developingnew twists and whorls and clusters like some complicated cell mass  --  first inch by inch , then faster , so that now it seemed that after the briefest holing-up in his studio he could come back to find everything changed : people stranger , cars more vicious-looking , even the quality of light altered in some indefinableway . But he had kept up with things . He knew what was going on in the world . Mary underestimated him . The gallery was a narrow white building with an awning that extended across the sidewalk . It sat on a quiet street among other buildings very much like it , out of sight of the bomb damage . " Well , at least it 's not too big , " Jeremy said , but as he stood on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking meter he had the feeling that this gallery outclassedhim somehow . Certainly , if he had been a mere passerby , he would have been intimidated by that great glassy door with its gold grillwork . He would never have gone in on his own . " Mary , " he said , " are you sure that this is a proper time for us to come ? "  | " I told you , Jeremy . People are never here on weekdays . " " Why do they keep it open , then ? " She did n't seem to have an answer for that . I n the foyer , lit by a yellow light , was a piece that Jeremy remembered from three or four years ago : an old man going through a wire trashbasket . The man himself was made of dull brown wrapping paper , crushed and reflattened . The basket was a network of all the glittery things he had been able to lay his hands on  --  small skewers for trussing poultry , a knitting needle , a child 's gilt barrette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lefty " on the blade . Within the basket was a cluster of bright colors formed from postage stamps and cigarette packs and an old bandanna handkerchief that Mr. Somerset had left lying on the couch one day . " Have n't they done it nicely ? " Mary asked him . " I told Brian , it 's the perfect keynote for the show . I 'm glad they set it up at the beginning this way . " " Yes , yes , " said Jeremy . But he was uncomfortable . He had never seen his work in such a setting before , among thick red carpets and hushed sounds and golden light . From some hidingplace in the back of his mind a picture leapt forth of the model for this piece  --  an old man he had seen from the bay window , rummaging in the trashbasket one cold November day . He remembered the dry grayness of the man 's skin , nothing like this warm brown wrapping paper , and the clawlikefingers and silently moving lips . None of it was caught in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Are n't you happy with it ? " " Oh , yes , " he said , and moved on . Past the hallway , behind the wall where the old man was displayed , stretched a larger room flooded with light and carpeted also in soft deep red . Five or six people were moving around it , stopping before each piece . He noticed the people before anything else . All but one were women , and they were whispering together about his work . His . He felt like rushingp164up and flinging his arms out , shielding what he had made . Two fat ladies stood in front of one of his old collages , one that was still two-dimensional ; a girl made her way too quickly down a row of his statues . His smallest statue , the first he had ever made , sat on a wooden column : a woman hanging out washing . A curve of tin among stiff white billows that he had formed by spraying canvas with clear plastic . He remembered conceiving the idea and then wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken him weeks to think of making it a statue . He had worked fearfully ; he had felt presumptuous , using up so much vertical space . But now a tag beside it read " From the Collection of Mrs. Herbert Lee Cooke "  --  one of the richest women in Baltimore . She had bought the statue the first day it was shown . And there were tags or " Sold " stickers beside most of the other pieces as well  --  each statue taller and more solid than the one before it . He wandered among them , dazed , holding his golf cap and chewing the tip of his index finger . He had never realized that he had producedquite this many things . Why , some people might considerhim an actual artist , by profession . Was that possible ? He pictured all those hours spent alone in his room , patiently fitting together tiny scraps , feverishly hunting up the proper textures , pounding in a row of thumbtacks until the back of his neck ached  --  all that drudgery . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared beside him and set a hand on Jeremy 's shoulder . " Hi , " he said . He wore a double-breasted suit that made him appear untrustworthy . Jeremy was used to seeing him in sweaters and corduroy trousers . His beard was trimmed too neatly . " Well , Jed emy , " he said . " What do you think of your show ? " All the visitors looked up , their faces startled and avid . Brian 's voice had carried everywhere . " We 've got them set up well , would n't you say ? " he asked . He smelled of some bitterp165spicy aftershave . He smiled not at Jeremy but at one of the statues , ignoring the visitors as if it were accidental that they had overheard . Jeremy freed himself from Brian 's arm . " You said , but you said  --  you told me there would n't be people here . " " Well , Jeremy , it is relatively  --  " You broke your word . " " Oh , now  --  " " I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to find her and saw , behind her worried face , all the spectators lookingpleased . Of course , they seemed to be saying , this is what we expected all along . Brian told us . Had he , in fact , told them something ? Did Jeremy have some kind of reputation ? He pulled his golf cap on with shaky fingers ; he turned on his heel , making Mary run to catch up with him . Yet immediatelyhe sensed that he had done something else they expected . There was nothing he could do they would not expect . He stumbled across miles of deep treacherous carpet , trapped still in their image of him . His breath came rustily . He flailed one hand behind him and encountered Mary 's strong fingers . Then she had caught up with him and was hugging his arm close to her side and helping him through the glass door . " Never you mind , " she whispered . " It 's all right , Jeremy . " Out on the sidewalk she raised her other hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There now , " she said . But she only troubled him more . Was it expected of him also that he would stand here being kissed like a child ? He wiped away the damp equal-sign left by her lips , and he pulled his coat more tightly around him and trudged off toward the car . They had no medical student now . Buddy had married and moved to an apartment , and before a successor could be found Mary came home one day with a girl hitch-hiker shep166had picked up while driving Miss Vinton 's car . A hippie named Olivia . Her hair was like spun glass , colorless and straight , long enough to sit on . She was so thin she seemed translucent and she wore jeans studded with silvery stars and a shimmering white trenchcoat . When she held out a hand to Jeremy , her fingers felt like ice . " I found this child thumbingrides , " Mary told him . " Can you imagine ? Why , you must be no older than Darcy ! " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't care , any age is too young , " and she went off to find the girl some food . Olivia trailed her , the way one of Mary 's children might . She had a watery , boneless way of walking . From the dining room , where Jeremy sat with a cup of tea , he could hear her questions : " What is this for ? What are you doing now ? Is it all right if I have one of these crackers ? " Later Mary told him that she had persuaded Olivia to stay in the south front bedroom . " What ? " said Jeremy . He mentally placed the house on a map , set down a star for the compass points , found south . " But that 's the students ' room ! We have always had students there ! " " I 'm sorry , I did n't know it mattered , " Mary said . " Well , no , of course it does n't matter . It 's just that  --  " " I worry so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mary said . It seemed to him that every year she was becoming more motherly . She had six children now and she was six times more motherly than when she had had only one . Was it a quality that grew by such mathematical progressions ? Last month , going to Dowd 's grocery store for milk , they had been approached by a teenaged boy asking for money for a meal . " Why , you poor soul ! " said Mary . " Have n't you eaten ? " It was six in the evening ; all her own children had been fed an hour ago . " Wait here , " she said . " They sell sandwiches atp167Dowd 's . " " Well , money is what I rather  --  " the boy said . " Do n't go away , " said Mary . " Stay with him , Jeremy . " She went alone into the store . The point of her kerchief fluttered behind her , her family-sized handbag swung at her side , her unstockinged legs flashed white in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eternal mother , scandalized , indignant , interfering , setting everyone straight . " Money is what I rather have , " the boy told Jeremy . Jeremy only nodded and swallowed . He could n't think of anything to say . Then Mary returned with a sandwich in waxed paper and a cellophane tray of oranges and a carton of milk . " You eat every bit of this , you hear ? " she said . " Look , " the boy told her , " you did n't have to go to all this trouble . Look , what I could really use is  --  " But she had pressed the food into his hands and turned to go into the store again . " Do n't gulp it , now , " she said . " Not on an empty stomach . " " Well . Thank you , ma'am . " Then he and Jeremy had stood looking at each other , bemused , unsmiling , across the knobs and angles of Mary 's gifts . At night , colors and shapes crowded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his children did : " Let me speak ! No , let me speak ! " He traced outlines in the dark with his index finger . He pressed his thumbs against his lids to erase images that disturbed him  --  cones rising in a tower , the base of one resting on the point of another in a particularly jarring way ; yellow and blue appearing together , a combination he could not tolerate . Meanwhile Mary slept soundly beside him , and her breaths were so soft and even that they might have been no more than the sound of his own blood in his ears . Were women always stronger than men ? Mary was stronger , even when she slept . Her sleeping was proof that she was stronger . In Jeremy 's insomnia there was somethingp168fretful and nervous ; he felt the presence of thoughts he would rather not look at , nameless fears and dreads . Yet Mary , who could name exactly what she feared and whose worries came complete to the last detail  --  Was Abbie 's tonsillectomy really necessary , when anesthesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tetanus shot for that cat bite ?  --  lay peacefully on her back with her palms up , her fingers only loosely curled , open to everything . She did n't even believe in God . ( Jeremy said he did n't either  --  how could he , knowing how carelessly objects are tossed off and forgotten by their creators ?  --  but he was haunted by a fear of hell and Mary was not . ) Mary was more vulnerable than any man , the deepest pieces of herself were in those children and every day they scattered in sixty different directions and faced a thousand untold perils ; yet she sailed through the night withoutso much as a prayer . There was no way he could ever hope to match her . He sank back through time until he encountered the faded , powdery face of his mother  --  a woman who had prayed all day every day , every breath a prayer . ( " I do n't have to say my prayers at bedtime , Jeremy , I 've been saying them since I got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sleep . It 's you I pray for . " ) He saw her pouring tea at his tenth birthday party , which he and she had celebrated all alone in the parlor . " Just us would be more fun , " she said , and of course she was right , because his classmates disliked him and if they spoke to him at all they called him Germy . " We do n't need those other children , " she said . She smiled at him over the teapot , with the corners of her mouth trembling slightly the way they always did , making her look uncertain of the smile , uncertain of what she said , uncertain that there was anything less than God Himself that she might have confidence in . The smile grew pale and then transparent . The teapot vanished . He saw her from even longer ago than the birthday party , some dis/tant point in time when hats were covered with starched cloth roses and her limp , watery dress was the height of elegance  --  the dress that looked exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could almost wonder if she had put it on inside out . She was taking him to the dentist . She stood in front of a receptionist whose hair seemed to be coated with black shoe polish . " I do n't care what you thought , " the receptionist said , " the appointment was for an hour ago and you 've missed it . You kept the doctor waiting . He had to go on to another patient . " " Well , perhaps there was a misunderstanding . Because I could n't have made it for an hour ago , you see , Jeremy would still have been in school then . Perhaps we  --  " " Are you questioning my word ? " " Please , oh please  --  " In front of all those people  --  a waiting room full of watchingpeople on needlepoint chairs . The receptionist bent her head to the letter she was writing , putting an end to the conversation . Her fountain pen dug angrily into the page and sparks of black ink flew out . " Come , Jeremy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little trembling sigh and took his hand to turn him around , to lead him out of the room . On the sidewalkshe said , " Do n't feel bad , darling , we 'll get you another appointment . " She patted his cheek , where a muscle was jumping . " We must n't waste our lives feeling cross with such people . " But it was n't the receptionist he was angry at ; it was his mother . Why had she waited there so foolishly , the center of attention , twisting her ridiculous little taffeta evening bag around and around in her hands ? Why had she pleaded that way ? He imagined the receptionist leaping up suddenly , overturningher chair behind her and stabbing his mother with that sputtery fountain pen . " Take that , you worm ! Die ! " His mother would only cower lower , and keep that tentative smile on her face . She would crumble into the floor , ground downp170to powder by the receptionist 's heels , not even raising her arms to protect herself . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguished love . " Jeremy , darling , " his mother said , " shall we go home and have a cup of cocoa ? " And he said , " All right , Mama , " but it hurt to speak , even ; he had clenched his teeth so hard that his jaw muscles ached . That was long ago . It was all in the past . He was through with that . He turned his pillow to the cooler side , lowering his head again very gently so that he would not wake Mary . He began reconstructing his favorite night game . In this game he possessed a sauntering , slap-happy courage that no one else suspected . He was given to acting on impulse . Driving down a city street one day on an errand ( never mind that he did n't know how to drive , and had no car ; he would work that out later ) , he was suddenly taken with the urge to leave town . He would speed along for block after block , at first just toying with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buoyant feeling of freedom swelled in his chest . All the traffic lights were green and all roads led directly out of Baltimore , without so much as another car to slow him down . The sky was dull and sunless , the best weather for his eyes . He could travel for hours without squinting or straining . He would stop when he got tired . Maybe never . If he ever settled down again it would be in a small , bare , whitewashed cubicle , possibly in a desert . He would change his name  --  a one-syllable first name , a onesyllablelast name . Something crisp . His art would change as well . That would happen automatically . If he changed his name his work would be totally different . He would be childless , wifeless , friendless  --  all alone , like that silent golden period between his mother 's death and Mary 's arrival . Only this time , of course , he would know enough to appreciate it . Back then , he had n't . He had felt then that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have somethingp171more to show for it . Was that what caused all major events in the world ? He had felt compelled to take desperate steps before it was too late , but now it seemed that life would stretch on forever and grow more tangled and noisy every day . There had been no need for such a plunge . He had waited for love like a man awaiting salvation . The secret , the hidden key . Was it love that failed Jeremy , or was it Jeremy who failed love ? Was there anything to hope for after love ? The baby started crying , working up to it with sharp little noises that broke into Jeremy 's thoughts . Mary rose from the bed and stumbled over to the crib , maybe still asleep , already murmuring words of comfort . " There now , Rachel . There now , Rachel . " She picked the baby up and Jeremy felt the jolt of the mattress as she returned to bed . " It 's that tooth , I believe , " she said . She spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be lying awake . She propped her pillow on the headboard , sat back against it and undid the buttons of her nightgown . When Jeremy looked over he found the baby 's shadow blended into Mary 's , and all that emerged clearly was one moonlit breast . " Where is Edward 's old teething ring ? " Mary asked him . " I 'll have to find it in the morning . The baby gulped softly . Jeremy laid a hand over his eyes . " The drugstore has something you can rub on their gums but I do n't believe it really works , " Mary said . Once , one of the few times she had ever referred to her life before she met him , she told him that when Darcy was born she had worried about feeding her . " I thought I would n't have enough milk , " she said . Then she laughed ; nursing came as naturally as breathing now , and he had often seen her walking around the house or even cooking with a baby glued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darcy . He constructed a scene in which she might worryp172again  --  in which she would come to him , on the edge of tears , asking him what he thought was wrong . " Never mind , you 're just tired , " he would tell her . " You must leave things up to me for a while . " He would arrange cushions around her , bring her tea , shepherd the older children to the other end of the house . " Quiet now , leave your mother alone . She needs her rest . " He would form around her a nest of love and safety , and later when he tiptoed in to check on her she would ask him , " What would I do without you ? " He had been picturing that for years now . He had ordered a book before Abbie was born , a book for prospective fathers ; he had read and memorized all the forms of support that he might offer her . Lighten her load , the book told him . Try to help out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distract her , be prepared for unreasonabletears . None of that advice had come in handy . Mary made her own nest . She sat beside him now relaxed and warm , and the baby gave soft mmm 's of satisfaction on the tail of every swallow . Then Mary said , " This thing I 've been meaning to talk to you about  --  " The baby stopped nursing and protested , giving away some tension in Mary . Jeremy opened his eyes . He had been aware all day of this news hanging over his head . He even thought he knew what it was . " You 're pregnant , " he said . " What ? " " I thought  --  " " You know I ca n't get pregnant when I 'm nursing . " " I was afraid that might not have worked this time , " he said . " You were afraid ? " He kept quiet . He did n't know how to take it back . " Jeremy ? " Mary said , but then she let it rest . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be divorced , Jeremy . " For a moment he thought she meant divorced from him , and his heart gave a lurch . Just for that one little imaginaryp173game he had played ? He had n't meant anything by it . But they were n't even married ! What was she talking about ? " Guy has divorced me . " He had asked her , once , what her husband 's name was . It was the least of what he wanted to know , but he had never dared bring up the real questions and he had thought that maybe , having started with his name , she might go on to tell him more . She had n't . " Guy Tell , " she said . " Guy Alan Tell . " After that , nothing . Not even chance clues  --  not even mentionof a trip on which her husband , incidentally , had accompanied her , or reports of some adventure in which he happened to be included . That single fact , " Guy Tell , " had become embedded in him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetfulness , with a literal squinching shut of his eyes whenever any thought of her husband recurred . Now her saying the name stunned him . It was as if she had suddenly entered into some hidden fantasy of his  - -  named , out loud , a product of his most private imagination . " What ? " he said . She seemed to understand that she did n't need to repeat it . She waited , calmly . " You 're divorced ? " he said . He sat up . He noticed how the air waves seemed to shiver , recoiling from a shocking word : divorce . Such a hard , ugly sound . Nothing like this warm-breasted shadow beside him . " Who was  --  how did you find out ? " he said . " The lawyer wrote me . They got my address from Gloria . " " From  --  ? I do n't quite see . " From his mother . " " Ah , " he said . This secret husband had had a mother , then . Also a father , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who called out greetings on the streets , he paid visits to people , he no doubt drove a car and made purchases and worked in some place of employment . He had once lain beside this very same woman , perhapsp174waiting for her to finish nursing the baby before he reached out for her with absolute , cool confidence . A lump of something like clay , thick and soft , rose up in Jeremy 's throat . " He divorced me on grounds of desertion , " Mary said . " That 's allowed when he has n't known my whereabouts for so long . " " Well  --  " said Jeremy . He coughed . " I mean  --  how did she know your whereabouts ? His mother . " " Oh , that 's just lately . I wrote her a letter . " " You did ? " " Just a note , really . I wanted to find out how she was getting along . " " I see , " Jeremy said . " I was very close to her , you see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day I was thinking , It 's Gloria 's birthday right about now . Could n't I send her a card to tell her I still think of her ? ' " She still thought of her . When was that ? At what point in her cheerful , bustling day , behind that tranquil face , did her thoughts turn to her old life ? Really , he did n't know anything about her . She might be thinking about her husband constantly ; she might be full of discontent ; she might be planning some new love affair far away from him . He suddenly remembered a night last week when she had been braiding Pippi 's hair in front of the television . Some celebrities were appearing on a panel show , among them a movie hero with deep , shadowed eyes . " Why does everyone think that man is so attractive ? " Mary asked . Jeremy had been filling out contest blanks , ignoring the program . " What man ? " he asked . " That one on the left , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy looked up then , puzzled , but Mary had not heard her own words and she merely snapped a rubber band on Pippi 's braid and gave her a pat . " Off you go now . Bedtime . " But it was n't until now that he thought top175wonder : Was she longing for something more ? When she read those romantic novels she liked , with the distraught pretty girls on the covers , was she wishing that she too had a man who would carry her up castle stairs or defend her with his sword or even , perhaps , frighten her a little with his dark , mysterious gaze ? As if she had guessed at all the cracks of uncertainty running through him , she turned to look at him over the baby 's head . In the dark her face seemed like a piece of felt . The baby made sucking noises in her sleep , lying on Mary 's arm as limp as a beanbag . Only Jeremy felt some brittle crumbling sensation inside him that kept him sitting upright . " Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary said . " Well , if you wanted to . " " Do you ? " " I do if you do , " he said . You do n't sound very sure . " Of course I 'm sure . " " We 'll have to do it in secret , then , " she said . " And I 'm afraid you 'll have to come with me , Jeremy . For real , this time . " " Oh , certainly . Anything you say . " " But I 'll make all the arrangements . Would you like to get married this Thursday ? Olivia 's home on Thursdays , she can babysit . " " All right , " he said . The crumbling sensation went on . Bits of him kept breaking away and falling , but Mary did n't seem to notice . All through the next day , while he sat in his studio filing down the metal edges of a statue , he kept thinking about this mother-in-law whom Mary still remembered after so many years . He saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could give Mary some indefinable quality that he was not up to . He pictured her holding Mary 's letter in enormous , motherly hands . He tried to imagine what Mary would have written . It was polite , it was almost obligatory , to ask a woman about the welfare of her son . " How is Guy doing ? I think of him often . " Oh , he could almost see those words in Mary 's round , looped handwriting . " I live with someone else now but Gladys ( or Dolores or whateverher name was ) , it 's not the same at all , he 's so wishywashyand spends so much time in his studio , and at first he wanted to make love too often and now he does n't want to hardly ever . " Jeremy winced and dropped a bolt and picked it up again . He imagined the mother-in-law 's answer . " Guy has a divorce since he gave up hope but you could come back any time , any time at all , Mary . Things have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that was what she would say . Things would never be the same any place that Mary left . At noon one of the children climbed the stairs to tell him lunch was ready , but he called through the door that he was too busy to come . In actual fact he was finishing the **25;1551;TOOLONG . He was working slowly , as he always did near the end of a piece , putting in small touches with long pauses for deliberation . He could easily have stopped for lunch . It was just that the thought of going downstairs made him feel so tired , somehow . All that noise ! That tumult of emotion , rising in billows around him as he tried to swallow his food ! Even from here he could hear the clatter of silverware , the children 's endless contests for their mother 's attentionand the sudden clamor over some domestic accident  --  as if , overturned , those peanut butter glasses painted with nurseryrhyme characters had spilled forth shouts and laughter and scoldings instead of milk . Above it all Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not understand how she man/aged this , speaking at such a low and steady pitch . He himself was drowned out , every time . " Children ? Oh , children , " he would say , " could n't you please  --  " Now Mary laughed , a rich soft laugh that carried effortlessly to every corner of the house . A few minutes later he heard her climbing the stairs . Dishes rattled gently on a tray . " Jeremy , " she called , " I 've brought your lunch up . " " Come in , " he said , but she could n't ; he had absentmindedlylocked the door . First the knob turned and then she knocked . He had to put down his file and get off his stool and let her in  --  a task that seemed larger than it was , like having to rearrange every cell of his body within some thick dark sac of concentration . " Egg salad , " she said . He stared at her dimly . She carried the tray in past him and beganlaying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a glass of milk , a salad bowl , a sandwich on a plate . Every time she set a dish down she had to move something of his out of the way . A glue bucket was pushed aside , a paintbrush was laid across the top of it ( not where it belonged ) . A horseshoemagnet clanged to the floor . " Sorry , " Mary said cheerfully . He felt that a long tail of noise and energy was pluming out behind her , brushing objects in his room as she turned . Although he had been thinking of her all morning , this seemed to be a different Mary from the one in his thoughts  --  clearer , sharper , more brightly colored . She changed the air in his studio , stirring up the center of it and making the corners look darker and dustier . The room appeared to be hers now . When she stepped back to look at the statue , he had the feeling that that was hers too . He imagined how efficiently she would make a statue : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion or a single revision , relying upon some rich lode of intuition that he did not possess . When she was done she would give the statue a loving smack on the rump , as if it were a child sent out to playp178after she had tied its shoelaces . " Very nice , " she said now . " I like it . " She turned and kissed him . She wound her arms around his neck . He said , " I should get back to work , Mary . " But then when she was gone the other Mary returned , the silent floating one of his thoughts , and the image of her writing to her mother-in-law continued to pain him so much that he sat on his stool bent over and clutching his chest , like a man suffering a heart attack . By early afternoon he had completed every last detail of the statue . Still , he did n't leave the studio . And when Brian came visiting  --  he heard his voice in the entrance hall  --  he refused to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . Jeremy did n't answer . Then Brian 's boots mounted the stairs , two steps at a time . His great hearty knock sounded on Jeremy 's door . " Hey , in there . You feel like a visitor ? " Jeremy frowned at the ceiling . He was lying on the couch with his hands clasped across his stomach , trying off and on to think of another piece to work on . He did n't feel like seeing anyone at all . But while he was framing an answer Brian gave up and went away again , and Jeremy heard his voice and Mary 's and then the slamming of the front door . He rose and padded over to a window . There was Brian crossing the street , weaving his way between cars stopped for a traffic light , arriving on the opposite sidewalk in a sudden burst of speed as if he had just made a daring escape . Jeremy watched after him for as long as he was in sight . It seemed to him that Brian 's walk was lighthearted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freedom . At suppertime , when Mary came with another tray , she said , " Why would n't you see Brian ? " " Perhaps tomorrow I will . "  | " You 're not still angry about what happened at the gallery , are you ? Jeremy , I honestly do n't think  --  " " No , it 's just , you see , I 'm busy with a new piece , " he told her . " Oh , I see . " Actually he never went straight from one piece to the next . It was necessary to have a regathering period , an idle space sometimes stretching into weeks . But Mary said , " I hope it 's going well , then , " and she took away his lunch dishes and left him his supper and a mug of hot coffee . When she was gone he turned off the light and went back to the couch . By now the studio was in twilight  --  a linty graynessthat he could almost feel on his skin . In spite of the warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that his heart had slowed , and his hands and feet were chilled . He stretched out on the couch and went to sleep , and the afghan made him dream of being held prisoner in some confinedand airless place . Long before dawn he awoke with a start . He spent several seconds wondering where he was . The doubt was more pleasantthan disturbing . Even after he had found the answer , he kept trying to push it away again so that he could return to that floating , rootless state . Then he rose and ate supper in the dark  --  cold vegetables and meatloaf , a bowl of some sticky thick liquid that turned out to be melted ice cream . Every swallow gagged him but he ate the entire meal , and he finishedthe last of his cold bitter coffee with a feeling of accomplishment . Was n't that what life was all about : steadfast endurance ? In the dark , where his thoughts seemed more significant than they did in daytime , he decided that this was what made the difference between him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , small and large , while Mary saw virtue in the refusal to accept . She was alwaysp180ready to do battle against the tiniest infringement . He consideredthose battles now with fondness ; he pictured her tall , energetic figure fending off door-to-door salesmen and overbearingteachers and grade school bullies and household germs , all with the same enthusiasm . It seemed to him that his acceptance and her defiance made up a perfect whole , with neither more right than the other , although up till now he had always assumed that one of them would be proved wrong in the end . He worked through this idea with a feeling of relief . He even thought of going downstairs to wake Mary and tell her about it , but of course she would have no idea what he meant . She never wondered about the same things he did . ( Did she wonder about anything ? ) She would only smile at him with sleepy , half-closed eyes and open the blankets and pull him in to her , her answer to all their problems . He dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat there wrapped in his afghan watching the sky whiten over the city . Was it possible that once , in the years before Mary , the house had been this still even in the daytime ? He had trouble remembering it . He began pretending that this silence was permanent  --  that Mary and the children had gone away for some reason and left the house echoing behind them . Then he considered his work . What would he do if he were left all alone with his sheets of metal and blocks of wood ? Would he still be successful if Mary were not standing behind him ? He began twisting his hands together on his knees ; something like anxiety or irritation tightened all his muscles . It was foolishto be asking himself such questions . He had been making his pieces all along , had n't he ? Long before she came here . He pushed back his armchair and flung scraps of cardboard off his worktable . He picked up a pencil and a sheet of newsprint , already drawing shapes in thin air while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn , Mary knocked on hisp181door and asked if he were all right , he had trouble placing her . " What ? " he asked , still frowning at his sketchpad . " Are you all right , I said . " " Oh , yes . " He was going to make a statue of Brian rounding the corner  --  a man half running , glad to be gone . He chose that figure because it seemed the most solitary . No dogs , brooms , tricycles , or children accompanied him . He chose wood because it was slowest and took the most patience . Half the morning was spent selecting pieces from the lumber pile in the corner , lovingly smoothing them , arranging and rearrangingthem . Cutting and sanding the curve of a single shin took till noon . When Mary knocked with his lunch tray he called , " Just leave it outside , would you please ? I 'll get it in a minute . " But in a minute he had forgotten all about it , and it was afternoon before the hollow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , looking down into the street . The glare of sunlight on cement came as a shock to his eyes . He had to squint to see his children playing hopscotchon the sidewalk  --  their chalked game like an aerial view of a city , the tops of their heads gleaming , two stick pigtailsflying out behind each little girl . The clothes they wore gave them a motley look . Plaids , ginghams , stripes , flowers , all mixed together . Hannah , spread-eagled on a skateboard , looked like one of those dolls made up of stacked felt discs all different colors : an orange scarf around her neck , a puffy pink quilted jacket , a red cardigan dangling below it and a plaid skirt below that , bare white knees , and the cuffs of blue kneesocksrising above floppy red boots . Their voices seemed too distant , as voices had back when he was a child sick in bed  --  words floating across some curtain of mist or water . He used to think the change was caused by his being horizontal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likep182people in a dream . They were arguing about whether someone had broken a rule . Jeremy could not figure out the point of this game . As far as he could see it involved hopping down a series of chalked squares . Was the pattern of those squares their own ? Was there some hidden , rigid set of regulations that he knew nothing about ? He was awed by their ability to decide on their own amusements , to carry on , by themselves , this mysterious tradition handed down by an older generation of children . They lined up efficiently , hopped with purpose , stooped for some sort of glittering marker and tossed it to a new square before stepping smartly aside to await another turn . He had never suspected that children on their own would be so organized . In the evening Mary knocked on his door and said , " Jeremy , are n't you ever coming out ? " " In a little while , yes , " he said . He blew sawdust off a stick of wood . " You 're tying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abbie 's bath night . Could n't you just let her in that long ? " " In a while . " He heard her sigh . He heard her whisper something he could n't quite catch . " What ? " he said . " I said , you wo n't forget tomorrow , will you ? " " Tomorrow . " " It 's Thursday tomorrow , Jeremy . " " Oh , yes . " " We 're getting  --  " " Yes , yes , I remember . " She set the tray outside his door . The familiar clinking of china on tin made him suddenly hungry , but he did n't go out to the hall . He waited for her to leave . He stood listening to her footsteps all the way down the stairs , and only then did he go to the door and open it . He did n't know why he behavedthat way . The smell of her on the landing  --  warmp183milk and honey sprinkled with cinnamon , a drink that had comforted him all his life  --  seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and locked it again . Standing just inside the room , holding the tray in one hand , he took bits of food in his fingers and wolfed them down . Behind him the sounds of the household crept up the stairs and seeped through the cracks around the door . He heard laughter and a thread of " Frere Jacques . " Mary and Olivia were calling back and forth to each other between two rooms . Mary 's voice was downward-slanting , definite , while Olivia 's rose in an uncertainway at the end of each sentence . This might be a school for women ; the thought had often occurred to him . In the old days he had assumed that what women knew came to them naturally . He had never suspected that they had to be taught . But listen to Mary , to the firmness of her voice , not issuing concrete instructions so much as showing Olivia how to be ; listen to Olivia slowly and questioningly taking on her tone . To the little girls , even , cleverly coaxing Rachel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they were all being tutored . Jeremy set his tray down and stood beside the door in silence , eavesdropping , impressed and envious . Were there no such tutors for men ? Was it only women who linked the generations so protectively ? But when footsteps climbed the stairs again  --  this time Olivia 's  --  he scurried back to his work . " Mr. Pauling ? Mary sent me with more coffee . " He stayed quiet , a quarter-sheet of sandpaper frozen in one hand . After a while she went away . By Thursday morning the framework of the statue was completed . Only he could have told what it was yet . There was just a skeleton , tied in odd places with strips from old sheets wherever gluing had seemed preferable to nailing . While he waited for the glue to dry he rummaged about for other ma/terials  --  coarse fabrics and copper wire and a length of fine screen that he had been saving for something special . He overturned bins and drawers , blinking repeatedly to clear his eyes . ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Under the sink he found a child 's wool cap and sat down to unravel it , building a pile of crinkly red yarn in his lap . Later he would stiffen the yarn with his spray can , let it stream out from behind his figure 's head . Whoever owned the cap would say , " Jeremy ! Is that mine ? You told us , Jeremy , you said you 'd stop using all our stuff up , remember ? " He rememberedvery well , but when he was in the middle of a piece some sort of feverishness came over him . He took whatever looked right , even the necessities of life . He broke or rearrangedthem as needed , fumbling in his haste , promising himselfthat he would replace the objects as soon as his piece was finished and he had the time again . Now he had no time at all . It always seemed likely at this stage that he might drop dead by nightfall , leaving his figure unfinished and his life in bits on the studio floor . What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the joints and tipping in that precarious way he was planning to change , he knew just how , once he found the proper base for it ? No one would ever guess what his plans had been . They would think the skeleton was what he had intended , with all its flaws . Surely , then , if ghosts existed he would have to become one ; his restless spirit would be forced to return to haunt what he had left undone . What he intended for this piece was the light , dissolving feel of Brian running , a splinter in a cold spring wind . He would be wrapped in matte surfaces . His face would be a thin blade of wood , cutting the air in front of him . He would trail curving tin streamers of motion . Tin ? He looked for the sheet metal , the shears . It was hard to breathe . This certainty about what he was making had the same physical effect as fear : his chest tightened and his heart seemed to be rising in hisp185throat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores too rapidly . When Mary knocked he did n't answer , did n't even bother keeping still for her . " Jeremy ? Jeremy ! " He bent tin , with a great hollow clang . Mary went away again . On his lunch tray there was a note . " This is our wedding day . Do you still want to ? " Something gave him a sharp stab of sorrow  --  the question mark , perhaps . The thought of Mary 's low , even voice asking that question . For the first time that morning he listened to what was going on downstairs , sorting out the separate noises from the steady hum that was present all day long . Someone was playing a Sesame Street record and someone else was running the blender at high speed  --  Olivia , no doubt , fixing one of her peculiar meals of seed-paste patties or fresh-ground peanut butter . The blender ran at the level of a scream , on and on , spitting when it came upon nuts as yet unbroken . A child was crying , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What time was it ? He looked at the clock on the windowsill but it had run down , long ago . It occurred to him that he had not bathed or shaved or changed clothes in days . He had a musty yellow smell and his teeth seemed to be made of flannel . Well , when he had finished cutting the tin he would take care of all that . He would come downstairs newly washed , freshly dressed , and locate Mary among all those jumbled voices . He pictured himselfdescending into the noise as he would enter the sea  --  proceeding steadily with his hands lifted and his mouth set , submerging first his feet and then his legs and then his entirebody , last of all his head . The wool from the cap turned out to be a mistake . Too soft , too temporary . He had unraveled it for nothing . He tossed it into a corner and cut more tin instead , in tiny strips that he curled around a pencil and then stretched out again so that they would crinkle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little seams of blood mixed with the paint and the gray rolls of glue on his fingers . Somewhere he had work gloves but he was in too much of a hurry to stop and look for them . The muscles at the back of his neck were stretched thin , and when he stood up with his bundle of tin strips he found that both legs were asleep . Now the strips had to be nailed onto the wooden head , which was the hardest part . First he had to find enough tiny sharp nails in his nail can and then he had to hammer them in absolutely straight or they skidded off the tin . His hands were sore all over , but the soreness was reassuring . He was merely getting used up , that was all . Like the lead of a pencil . Naturally the hands were the first to go . At twilight Olivia brought his tray up . " Mr. Pauling ? Could I come in ? " The thought of food gave him a sick feeling . He ignored her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a while to realize that it was the darkness . The statue was only a glimmer before him . He walked over to the door on crippled , icy feet , but when he had turned the wall switch on the light hurt his eyes so much that he clicked it off again . He made his way to the couch and lay down , with one arm set across his aching forehead . As soon as he was comfortably arranged he felt a lurch like some gear disengaging , a ping ! in his ears , and his mind floated free and he slept . Even in his dreams , he worked . He cut , pasted , hammered , sanded . He had a feeling of pressure to finish , a sense of being pushed . Although he forced himself to ignore the pressurehe went on working without let-up , and the closer he came to completing the piece the more he was filled with a sense of joy and light-headedness . When the last nail was hammered in he laughed out loud . He backed off across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished statue couldp187burst upon him all in one instant , and then he looked up to see what he had made . A room . A corner of a room , a kitchen , to be exact . A counter with a loaf of rye bread and a bread knife on it , and a coppertone clothes dryer spilling out realistic wads of floweredand plaid and gingham clothes and a formica table with chairs set around it  --  oh , how he must have worked over that table ! Its aluminum edge was grooved with three parallel bands ; such attention to detail . The chairs were mismatched , a subtle touch . The wooden one alone must have taken him weeks to make , with its bulbous legs and the tie-on ruffled cushion on its seat and the Bugs Bunny decal on its back . He had even included , on the rungs , the scars of a hundred children'steetering shoes . Was this what he had labored over for so many hours ? He woke feeling dismal and empty and frightened . Sunlightflooded his face , a deep gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be mid-morning . What he wanted most was a cup of hot coffee , but all he found outside his door was last night 's supper . A wilted salad , a glass of lukewarmmilk , some peculiar brownish casserole that he could not identify . He ate it anyway , although it went down his throat in lumps . He swallowed the milk with narrow , dutifulsips and then set his tray outside the door again . Now he saw that the statue was all wrong . What had he been thinking of , setting on each curl of hair that way ? He might have been building a doll , or a department store mannequin . With a screwdriver he began prying the strips off , one by one . His hands hurt so much that he could hardly bend them . The statue 's head showed nail marks down its back , but he was already thinking up ways to cover them . At noon he checked for lunch , but found none . Later in the afternoon he checked again . There were only the supperp188dishes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mary ? " The word echoed back . There was not a sound in the house ; only a clear , bell-like silence in which each of his footsteps fell too loudly . He descended the stairs , passing the empty second floor and continuing to where his children would surely be absorbed in a fairytale or some quiet table game . No . No one was there . In the parlor the baby 's playpen was empty and the toys on the floor seemed to be coated with a furry film of stillness . In the dining room the face of the TV was sleek and blank ; in the bedroom his and Mary 's bed was made so neatly that it seemed artificial , something from a furniture store display . He had the feeling that no one had slept there for months , if ever . And the kitchen was strangest of all . The counters were absolutely clean and shining , like an advertisement for a linoleum company . No floury measuringcups , no cucumber peels , no stacked-up dirty dishes . The floor gleamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hollowly . He felt that his sense of time , which was never good , had deserted him . Had he missed something ? Had the days carriedeveryone else on by and left him stranded in some vanishedmoment ? Maybe his family had just gone out to a movie . Maybe they had abandoned him forever . Maybe they had grown up and moved some thirty years before , had children of their own and grown old and died . He could n't prove that it was n't so . Then , turning to the refrigerator for food and solace ( fumblingat some new kind of double door where he had expected the old single one ) , he found a note stuck on with a teapotshapedmagnet . " Dear Jeremy , I have taken the children and left you . I borrowed Brian 's cabin at the Quamikut Boatyard . I think it 's best . Love , Mary . " He took the note off the door and read it over and over . It seemed that the air had gone out of him , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his backbone . Finally he folded the piece of paper several times and tucked it in his shirt pocket . He headed through the house and back upstairs , fixing the image of his new statue very firmly in his mind like some magnetic star that would guide him through this moment . In the studio he resumed work immediately . He sanded the wooden head smooth again , at first so hard that the friction burned his fingers through the paper but then more slowly and then more slowly still . Like some clumsy , creaking wheel , he ground to a stop . He dropped the sandpaper and stood motionless , one hand upon his statue , staring numbly at the bare walls of the studio . Deserted , he was like an old man who sees the last of the guests to the door and returns , stretching , and yawning , to an empty room . Now I am alone again , he says . Finally . We can get down to what I have been waiting to do . What is it I have been waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean that I planned it with the same kind of bottled-up , excited energy . I lay awake all Thursdaynight making mental lists of what I would need for the children  --  just the essentials . We were finally getting down to the essentials again . I calculated the earliest time I could telephone Brian in the morning , and I decided on seven . Which was too early , as it turned out . I have forgotten the pattern of life without children . Brian answered sounding hoarse and sleepy , and he did n't seem to be thinking well . I said , " Brian , do you still have that house by the river ? " " Who is this ? " he asked . " It 's Mary Pauling . " " Do I what ? " " Do you still have that Would it be all right if the children and I went out there for a few days ? " " Out  --  ? " " I would n't ask you this but you did say you never use it yourself . Did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " You want to take the children there ? " " That 's right . " " You and the children but not Jeremy ? " " That 's right . " " But this is not a vacation house . " " No , I know that . " " It does n't even have hot water . And it 's filthy . " " Yes , we 've been there once , remember ? " " Mary , " Brian said . " Are you  --  I mean , is this  --  you 're not leaving him or anything . " " Oh , " I said , " you know Jeremy , he 's just so caught up in his work right now and I thought it would help if we got out of his hair for a while . " Then Brian said , " I see . Well , of course . You can use it as long as you like . " I could tell that he was still puzzled . But how else could I have explained it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of course I could have reminded him but that would have been the third reminder on top of my proposing in the first place , and what kind of wedding is that ? " By then I was packed . I had done that at dawn , while waiting for it to be time to call Brian . I tiptoed into the children 's rooms as they slept and I felt for their things in the dark . All night I had been looking forward to it  --  I do like getting organizedto go someplace  --  but it turned out not to be what I had expected . For one thing , the bare essentials for six chil/dren can fill a trunk in no time . You do n't get the same feeling of purity as when you run away with one small child and her favorite doll . Clothes , vitamins , toothbrushes , baby aspirin , diapers , Edward 's potty chair , Pippi 's antihistamine , seven pairs of plastic pants ... Also , I felt so sad . Had n't I once sworn never to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never Jeremy . I did n't tell the children until Miss Vinton had had her breakfast and left for work . I knew they would have passed it on to her ; they ca n't keep secrets . Miss Vinton took an endlesstime buckling her mackintosh , smoothing the lapels down , checking on a little stain near the hem . I thought I was going to start screaming and shaking her , but instead I went on smiling . I looked steadily downward so she would n't notice any difference in my face . " Have a good day , Miss Vinton , " I said . Then just as I was closing the front door after her I saw how straight she held her back , that rigid board of a spine marching off to deal with the world , those enormous Mary Janes flapping along , and I wished I had told her after all and given her a hug for goodbye . Mr. Somerset sometimes slept till noon and Olivia even longer . She had a job now at a sort of leather shop . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that she would sleep through our going . ( The night before , making supper , setting out a tray for Jeremy , I started crying right in front of her . " Oh , " I said , " I just ca n't go on with these everlasting trays of his , " so she took over . She gave him part of her casserole  --  somethingorganic , I believe . Later I was so ashamed . Have n't I been trying all this time to instill some sort of stabilityin her ? This morning I did n't want to say anything to her at all . I could n't face her . I would n't know how to explain . ) I stood at the foot of the stairs for a moment , listening for any sounds from her room or Mr. Somerset 's . Then I said , " Children ? " They were still dawdling over breakfast.  |p193They  thought they were going to school that day . I went out to the kitchen and leaned against the doorframe . " Guess what , children , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They wanted to know where  --  all but Darcy . Darcy just got very still . She was feeding Rachel her Pablum , and she stopped the spoon in mid-air and did n't even notice when Rachel started shouting and grabbing for it . " We 're going to spend a few days at Mr. O'Donnell 's cabin near the boatyard , " I said . " Remember last summer , when he took you all to see his boat ? We 'll leave after breakfast ; Mr. O'Donnell has kindly offered to drive us there . " " Something 's gone wrong , " Darcy said . " Of course not , honey . " " But it 's a school day . I have a math test . " " You can always make it up . " " It 's going to count for half my grade . " " You can make it up , Darcy . " " Are we leaving Jeremy or something ? " Well , of course she would guess that . I suppose she remembersleaving Guy , although she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I said , " No , Darcy , do n't be silly . We 're giving him a little peace and quiet , is all . " Then I said , " Mr. O'Donnell is just providing the transportation . " Which I might not have needed to add , but I could n't be sure . You never can tell what is going through that head of hers . At nine o'clock Brian was supposed to be picking us up . ( There was a city bus , but it did n't go the entire way and I was just as glad we were n't relying on it . ) I gave each child a coat and a load to carry . " Hurry now , " I said , " out to the vestibule . Not outdoors , just in the vestibule . " I did n't want Jeremy to see us leaving . I was afraid that one of the children would suddenly decide to run up and kiss him goodbye , but nobody thought of it . Then too he might come down on hisp194own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would have no reason to leave his studio ? The fact is that if he did come , if he said a single word to keep me with him , I would gladly stay forever . I did n't want to go . Yet I kept feeling this pressure to get out of the house before he discovered it . I kept saying , " Move , Edward , we 're in a hurry , " and when Hannah wanted to run upstairs for her bear I said , " No ! Stay down ! " I scared her . She went immediately to the vestibule and stood sucking her thumb and staring up at me . I was like a burglar trying to escape without a sign , leaving behind me those gleaming countertops washed clean of every fingerprint . I made them all whisper . " Olivia 's asleep , hush ! " I said , and they stared . Hush for Olivia ? She could sleep through nuclear warfare . We stood packed solid in that little cube of a vestibule , steaming up the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come ! If he would come and say , " What 's going on , Mary ? " and blink at me and put out one of his warm , pale hands to touch mine ! Then I would herd everyone back in and lock all the doors and draw all the curtains , and Brian could wait outside our house forever . His car was a powder-blue Mercedes . Well , I suppose he is quite rich . He drew up soundlessly and peered toward the house , and I pushed the children out before he could honk and attract Jeremy 's attention . " Hurry , now , " I said . " Give me the baby , Darcy . Do n't forget that basket . Where 's my purse ? " I was preceded by a parade of belongings , like some pampered movie star . Children , grocery bags , stuffed animals  --  I was padded with belongings . I felt I should apologize to Brian for having so many children , but during the first few minutes he was out loading things into the trunk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was prone to car sickness ; we so rarely drove . I gave Abbie a tablet by accident and then made her spit it out again . " Oh look , " Ip195told her , " you ought to know if you get sick or not  --  " All of which helped me get over being embarrassed in front of Brian . I knew that he must be shocked at me . I have a very clear picture of how I appear to others : I am so big and slow and unexcitable , and women like that do n't act on impulse . They never leave people , certainly . Now when he was back in the car and maneuvering the rush hour traffic he kept throwing me sideways glances , maybe worrying that I would burst into tears or list all my grievances or spill some dark secret that he did n't want to hear . I did n't , of course . I kept the tears away by refusing to look behind me all the while that our house was in sight  --  that narrow , funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's old tattered constructionpaper Valentines glued to the upstairs panes and the dead Christmas tree on its side in front , dripping tinsel , waitingall these months to be collected  --  and who knows , maybe Jeremy drawing back a frayed lace curtain high on the third floor and peering out , dim and cloudlike , trying to understand what I had done to him . What was my purpose , sailing away in this ridiculous babybluecar ? We headed out through stretches of Baltimore that I had only seen once or twice before in my life , rovvhouses layered over with ugly new formstone , dead-looking saplings scattered along a divided street so wide and gray that looking at it seemed to bleach my eyes . Meanwhile the children said nothing . I had never known them to keep so quiet for so long . They sat in a row in back , each of them framed by stuffed-in bits and pieces that could n't fit into the trunk . They gazed dreamily out the windows . Maybe they were in a state of shock , suffering through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were just admiring the view . Who knows ? Children live in such a mist . I believe that most of what happens comes as a total surprise to them even whenp196you think you 've explained it . I said , " Abbie ? Are you comfortable ? Pippi ? " They looked at me blankly , then looked away again . Hannah wet her finger and drew an H on the windowpane . " In a week or so it will be spring , " Brian told me . " Then would be a good time for you to be out there . " " It 's a good time now , " I said . " It 's spring now . " " This morning I could see my breath . " " We 're not made of glass , you know . " " Mary , that cabin is no better than sleeping out . Maybe you 've forgotten . There 's no heat , no  --  " " I remember that , " I said , " but it 's the only place I know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , braced for me to begin my story . I said , " And I certainly do thank you . Last time we were there the children loved it . " The closed look did n't fade . He said , " Tell me this , Mary . How long were you planning to stay ? " " Well , I had n't made any definite plans yet . " " I mean  --  " " Probably not long , " I said . I felt I had to help him out . " I hope you do n't mind my asking , but do you have enough money ? " " Oh yes , " I said . " Because if you do n't , now  --  " " Brian , you know better than anyone that Jeremy 's just sold four pieces , " I said . Actually the little money Jeremy had made was still in the bank , and I had left the checkbook on his bureau , where he would be sure to find it . I was n't a genuine burglar . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my coupon money , which I had been saving against trouble all these years as I once promised myself I would . It had mounted up . Fifty dollars for telling how I use old bottle crates to make spice racks , twenty-five for the third-best recipep197based on sliced pasteurized processed cheese food and a dollar back for ten labels off canned beans . The money was in a plastic refrigerator container in my purse , and I reached in to touch it and felt strong and competent and too big for the car . Never mind , children ; I might carry you away without ever saying why but at least I will be with you , and I will provide for you . I learned my lesson the first time around . Women should never leave any vacant spots for the men to fill ; they should form an unbroken circle on their own and enclose each child within it . We passed barren stretches now , where the fields had been peeled back and naked buildings sat on jagged slabs of concrete , looking as if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed long avenues of service stations and cut-rate tire dealers and machine shops , and then oil refineries and warehouses and strange mechanical monsters standing alone in tangles of dry grass  --  electrical objects on wiry , spraddled legs , tanks and cylinders , gigantic motors with bolts as big as grown men and twisted black pipes that could suck up a house , all silent and unused . The cars around us now were rusted and crumpled , fantastically finned , driven by gum-chewing men ; we were close to the Bethlehem Steel Works . " Look ! " said Pippi . " Country ! " and she pointed to a matted gray line of tree branches far , far beyond an auto graveyard . " When we get to the river , can we swim ? " she asked . " Philippa Pauling ! You 'd get pneumonia . " " Typhoid , more likely , " said Brian . " Bubonic plague . " He looked over at me . I thought he might be about to smile , although it was hard to tell beneath that beard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing out sights on the road and quarreling over whose turn it was at the window . The junkyards gave way to houses , all tiny and papery-looking but with signs of real people in them , at least . Wooden don/keys pulled wooden carts across the front yards , and there were bird baths and flowered mailboxes and silvery balls on pedestals everywhere we looked . Some people had set up housekeeping in trailers with cement bases built in under them . Now , why would anyone want to do that ? All those temporary objects resting on permanent foundations ? Well , maybe it was just my mood that made me wonder . I felt like a solid stone house , myself , jacked up on little tiny wheels when I had no business going anywhere . Now the space between neighbors grew larger and we passed through woods  --  scrubby and meager , but woods all the same . We turned off onto a gravel road lined with more houses , most of them smaller than the boats that sat in the driveways . Cabin cruisers  --  ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boating so much . I 've never cared for the water at all , not one way or the other . To get to Brian 's house you go straight down to the river , through a cluster of bleak shacks and a store and a long shed where they do repair work in the wintertime . There were only a few boats tied up at the docks . The season had hardly begun . We went plummeting along a dirt road that ran alongsidethe water , and then Brian braked and we looked up to see his cabin : a gray weathered rectangle with a tin roof , and not a perfect right angle anywhere on it . Everything was sagging , leaning , buckling , splitting . The tops of both steps were missing ; anyone entering would find himself stepping into wooden boxes , sinking down into cold black spidery caverns . I knew all that ahead of time , of course . I had meant what I told Brian . But still ! There are some things you ca n't actually summon up in your memory  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the exact atmosphere , the weight and texture and quality of air , that exists in certain places . I knew that Brian 's shack was dismal but I had forgottenhow just standing next to it would make you feel dankp199and chilled , a despairing feeling , and how when you went in some heaviness would press down on your skin and cause your heart to sink . This is not just myself I am talking about . The minute we were inside Brian reached out and touched my arm , unnecessarily , as if the gesture had been startled out of him . " Mary ! " he said . " You ca n't stay here . " The children climbed in one by one and fell silent , and stood in a huddle together shivering . Part of it was the cold , of course . There is nothing so cold as air that has been trapped beneath tin all winter . Then there was the dirt . When Brian bought his ketch the shack came with it , automatically . The previous owner had stayed here whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early morning sail . Brian could n't have cared less about the shack itself . He let the grit form a film on the table and the mildew grow on the swaybacked couch and the rust trickle down from the faucets in the kitchen sink . Boys broke windows , birds flew in and died after battering themselves against the walls . Why , I could have shoveled the dirt out ! I pictured myself with a great garden spade , laboring over the cracked beige linoleum . Then I saw how I would rip down t hose tatty plastic curtains and scour the sink white again and cover the couch with some nice bright throw , and all my muscles grew springy the way they had the night before when I was planning the packing , and I knew that we would stay . " You 're not serious about this , " Brian told me . " Could you bring in our things , do you suppose ? " I set Rachel on my hip and took a tour of the house . Not that there was much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an armchair , and the kitchen merely took up one end of it  --  a sink and hotplate , a table and three chairs . The bedroom held a concave double bed and an army cot and a highboy with one drawer missing . In a little cubicle off thep200bedroom was a toilet with a split wooden seat , its tiny pool of water a coppery color , set squarely beneath the biggest window in the house . Something about that window  --  the fact that it was curtainless , or the white scum on its panes  --  made the light passing through it seem cold and eerie . I stood staring out of it for minutes on end , although I knew I should be helping Brian . I watched the children carry things from the car , all of them ghostly behind that cloudy glass . They tottered beneath blurred objects that I could not identify , and in their midst walked Brian , stepping precisely in his narrow Italian shoes , carrying the potty chair and somethingpink . When they entered the house , they seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a television screen into your living room . I heard their voices , warm and high-pitched and louder than I had expected , and then Edward started crying over a scraped shin and I went out to comfort him . I was very glad to see their faces . Their noses were pink from the fresh air and they were sniffing and puffing . " Where shall I put this ? " they kept asking . " What do you want me to do with this ? Where will we sleep ? What will we eat ? " I bent to roll Edward 's jean leg up , tilting Rachel on my hip , but Rachel was used to that and she just took a clutch of my blouse and went on smiling in her sidewaysposition , as adaptable as any of them . When I went out to say goodbye to Brian I could tell that he was still worried . " Well , so long ! " I said . " And thanks again , Brian "  --  singing it out , hoping to cheer him up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Look , " he said . " We 're enjoying this , Brian . " " Look . Why do n't you tell me the whole story ? " " There 's nothing to tell , " I said . He sighed and climbed into the car . He rolled down the window to give me last-minute instructions  --  " There 's a phone up at the store . . . you can turn on the water out back besidep201the . . . call me if you . . . "  --  and I nodded and waved and smiled . Then his car disappeared down the road , and I turned back to see my children watching me anxiously from the doorway . They were clustered at all heights , smudged from the things they had been carrying , framed by rotting wood with a great hollow blackness behind them . I have seen happier pictures in those ads appealing for aid to underprivileged children . I never thought that any children belonging to me would look that way . From the little store up at the boatyard we bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark but it hardly showed . Lunch was sandwiches and supper was canned spaghetti , and after supper we fell into bed . Bed : that was a problem . I put the three older ones in the double bed and Edward and Hannah at opposite ends of the couch . Rachel and I used the army cot . We did n't even have sheets  --  just the blankets I had brought and one musty old quilt we found in the highboy . The children were tired enough to sleep anywhere , but I lay awake for a long time wondering what I thought I was doing . I tried to call up a picture of Jeremy . Had he missed us yet ? I imagined him sitting in front of the TV in the darkened dining room , keeping silent company with the boarders . Whenever he had something to think over he would stare at the television for hours on end . Maybe he was weighing us in his mind that very minute , stacking us up , listing our faults and our virtues . Or mine , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the children . They might get on his nerves sometimes but at least they were mostly his own flesh and blood . I was the interrupter , the overwhelmer ; nobodyhas to tell me that . I saw how he had to tear his eyes from his work when I climbed the stairs to ask him could he babysit while I went to a kindergarten conference ? wouldp202he feed Hannah while I took Edward to the doctor ? did he happen to have change for the diaper man ? I knew those things were n't as important as his sculptures , but what did he expect me to do ? This is what comes with having children . You do n't just tie off their little navel cords and toss them on their way like balloons . You have to start thinking about adenoids and zinc ointment and the proper schooling , you worry about nutrition and germs , money begins to matter suddenly . Oh , hear how shrill my voice gets . Imagine what it would be like to be interrupted by such a voice just as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! Did he think I did n't know ? I never spoke to him without a sense of holding myself in check , trying to keep the reins in . I did n't want to dominate . When I talked to him with big , wide gestures , with power and energy flooding out of me , I saw how he quailed and then made himself stand firm . He was wishing that I would shrink a little . He never guessed that I already had shrunk , that this was as small as I could get . I sent him messages through the dark : Come and get us . Call Brian , call the boatyard . Make up some excuse for missingyour wedding , anything at all , I 'll believe it : you suffered a stroke or amnesia , you were mugged in the studio , you would never have simply decided that you did n't want to marry me . I thought up ways that he might get in touch with us . I pictured the storekeeper banging on our door  --  " Lady ? Man up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life or death . " Or he might come in person . No . Never . But could n't he , just this once ? He would n't bang . His knock would be so soft I would wonder if I had imagined it . I would open the door and find him waiting , hidden in the dark , recognizable only by the dear , sad hopefulness in his stance and that hesitantbreath he always took before moving toward me . For thatp203moment I would give up anything , half the years of my life even , anything but the children . I made a hundred silent promises , but the night just went trailing on and on and the only sound I heard was the murmuring of the baby in the crook of my arm . We finished shoveling the dirt out . We scrubbed the floor and dusted the furniture , we replaced the broken steps with cinderblocksthat Abbie found down by the water . Darcy washed the kitchen cupboards and the mismatched dishes she found stacked in them , and scoured the sink . The little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard patches over the broken panes . We tore down the curtains and the great meshy spiderwebs , we ripped the tacked-on oilcloth off the table and the draggled calico skirt off the sink . From the boatyard store we bought brighter lightbulbs , a bucket of disinfectant , a flashlight for walks in that deep , country dark that is so startling after a life in the city , and finally  --  three days later , when I stopped thinking we might be leaving at any minute  --  aluminum cots for the children to sleep on and more blankets to cover them with . The store had no pillows except the life-preserving kind . My children have always slept on pillows . " Never mind , " I told them , " this way is good for the spine . You 'll be healthier . " Not that health seemed to be any problem . They worked hard every day fixing up the house , as if it were a game ; they ate enormous meals and slept like rocks every night  --  pillowless and sheetless , cracklingabout on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered what I would do with them if we had to stay here so long it stopped being a novelty . Should I put them in the local school ? But it was so close to the end of the year by now  --  nearly May . The weather was getting warmer . We peeled off some of the layers of clothing we 'd been wearingp204day and night . And as we slacked up work on the house the children simply took to the outdoors . They lugged Rachel with them through the tall grass and pestered the boatmen and hung around the docks . They were n't allowed to touch the water , even  --  it was foul and filmed with grease . " What about summer ? " Pippi asked me . " Wo n't we get to go swimming ? " I said , " Of course not . I 'll get you a wading pool , if it 's hot . " Summer ! Would we still be here when summer came ? Brian stopped by almost every day . I told him not to but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat moored out on the river , a little blue ketch bobbing in front of our house . " How are things in the city ? " I asked him . " What 's happening in Baltimore ? Is the show going well ? Do you have many buyers ? " All except what I wanted to ask most : Why does n't Jeremy miss us ? The only time he mentioned Jeremy was once during the first week , when it was still cold . I remember the cold because he asked me to step outside with him a minute , away from the children , just as he was leaving . I came in my sweater , with my arms folded across my chest for warmth , and he said , " Not like that , get a coat . I 'll wait . " Then out beside his car he said , " Mary , I feel I 'm in an awkward position here . " " Do you want me to leave ? " I asked . What would I have done if he 'd said yes ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , but I 'd like to know what you expect of me . Am I supposed to be keeping your whereabouts a secret ? Because if I am , now  --  " " Oh no , " I said . " Jeremy knows where I am . " " I was n't sure that he did . " " He knows . I told him , I wrote him a note . " Then I thought , Suppose he never saw the note . Is thatp205why I have n't heard from him ? I said , " Did he say he does n't know my whereabouts ? Have you seen him ? Did he ask you ? " " I saw him , yes . He did n't say anything . He did n't even seem to want to mention your going . " " Oh , " I said . " Well , you can tell him , Brian . " " Of course I would n't bring the subject up myself . But if he asked , you see , I felt that I was in an awkward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Tell him . It is n't as if this were a fight or anything . " " What is it , then ? " I pulled my coat tighter against a breeze . " I do n't want to pry , " Brian said , " but is this something permanent you are doing ? " I did n't answer . I had questions of my own . I wanted to know how Jeremy had looked and whether he was getting enough rest and eating right . ( He was always so fond of sweets and he did n't like meat . ) But I knew those were housewifely questions that would make Brian smile , and anywayhe would n't have been able to tell me . Oh , sometimes I think of other artists ' wives , people that Brian must run into all the time . I picture them fragile and blond and hollowchecked , the kind that model in the nude and lead unscheduledlives in garrets and never , never complicate things with children and plumbers . When I used to come clumping into the gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black dress with the spit-up milk down one shoulder , I imagined that Brian looked stunned . He would stare at me , and if he happened to be talking with other women they would hush and stare too . I suspected that they were feeling sorry for Jeremy . " An artist  --  married to her ? " Then I would pull my stomach in and stuff the straggles of hair back behindmy ears , and when I was looking at paintings I spent longer before each one than I wanted to , just showing I couldp206appreciate art . I would n't have been caught dead mentioning anything domestic . And now all I allowed myself to say was , " I hope he 's making out all right . " " Oh , you know Jeremy , " Brian said . I had no idea what that was supposed to mean . He smiled down at me and said , " Do n't worry , Mary . I 'm sorry I brought it up . Go back insidenow before you catch a cold . " The next time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was afraid to ask . Now more and more boats were tethered at the docks and bobbing on moorings . Weekdays , when not many people sailed , I could look out over a stretch of black water prickling with masts , and I liked to pretend that I was some fisherman 's wife living in a hut at the edge of the ocean . The river did have the feeling of an ocean . There was no opposite shore in sight ; from this boatyard you sailed due east into the Chesapeake Bay , which looked like white veils at the limits of our vision . Late Friday afternoon the city people would begin to arrive from Baltimore and Washington  --  couples dressed for yachting , carrying ice buckets and windbreakers and Hudson Bay blankets . My children would crowd along the dock to stare at them . We saw their sails scudding away all Saturday , converging on us again all Sunday evening like birds flocking home . While we ate our supper doors would be slamming in the parking lot , motors revving , voices calling goodbyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks in the gravel and those naked masts lined up again beside the docks . A few people drove in during the week to sail on their own or make minor repairs , but they were quieter and the only time I was aware of them was when I ran into them at the store . Then their solid , confident city voices startledme , and I would stand gawking like any country woman as they read off their long extravagant lists . Ice , they wanted ,  |p207and  a Phillips screwdriver and a can of rust remover and a sack of potato chips . Luxuries , every one . We took our food unchilled , or bought it from the store refrigerator just before time to eat ; our tools we borrowed from neighbors or made ourselves from scraps ; we stripped that everlasting salt-air rust off them with the Coca-Cola left in discarded cans . As for potato chips ! I made the children eat protein foods instead . I have never liked being stingy with food but what else could I do ? I fed them lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby bits from my plate . Gerber 's was too expensive . Even doing the laundry was expensive . Once a week I carried the dirtiest things to the store washing machineand dropped my quarter in the slot and sprinkled on the detergent , rationing every grain . I lugged the clothes home wet and hung them up to save fifty cents , even if it was rainy and I had to drape the living room with them and hat my way between damp blue jeans for a day and a half till they dried . Then here came this city man with his list so long that it filled two separate pages of his memo pad , not to mention what he idly tossed in from the counter displays as he wandered about the store whistling through his teeth . I doubt if he noticed me . If he did he probably thought I came from one of those shacks beside the store , where the boat mechanic lived or the carpenter or the old retired steelworker and his daughter . Poor white trash with dusty paper flowers before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen doors to keep the flies away . That was what I had become . My children ran in and out between counters with their faces dirty and their dresses unironed , their feet bare and callused even before the summer had set in . When Brian came he almost always offered to take us sailing , unless he had brought a girl along or a group of his friends . I was afraid he felt he had to offer . " Brian 's here ! Brian 's here ! " the children shouted when they saw his car ,  |p208and  I would say , " Stop , now ! Hush . I want you to stay in here with me . " They could n't understand that . They always crowded around the windows and cheered when he knocked . To make up for them I kept my back to the door and was slow answering and pretended to be surprised when I saw him . " Just stopped by to see what you were doing , " he would say , and usually hand me something -- a little patterned rug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cluttering up his apartment , most often a sack of some kind of candy for the children . " How about it , kids ? " he would say . " Feel like a sail ? " He said he needed the help on deck . I did n't believe him . I was afraid he felt responsible for us in some way . I did n't want to say no to the children  --  what other treats did they have ?  --  but usually I stayed home myself and kept the baby . I only went sailing twice all spring . The first time was the first sail I had had in all my life , and I did n't think much of it . I do n't like to be floated to places , willy-nilly . But I stood on the deck with Rachel on one hip , pretending to enjoy myself , and he did n't keep us out too long . The second time was unplanned . It was in July , after several days of rain . He came late one afternoon when the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if you 'd do me a favor , " he told me . " Oh , anything ! " I said . I was so glad to have him asking me for something . " After rainy spells , if I do n't have a chance to get down here myself , would you row out to the boat and dry my sails for me ? " " Do what ? " " Come out ; I 'll show you . " So we left the baby with Darcy and pulled the dinghy out of the weeds in front of the house , and he showed me how to row . Well , that much I more or less knew already , having been to Girl Scout camp on a muddy pond the summer I was ten . But then we reached the ketch and I felt so clumsy . Ip209hated that clambering up the side , wondering if I might kick the dinghy out from under me or tip Brian into the water when he offered me his hand . Up on deck I shook myself out and smoothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ! " I said . " Now tell me what to do . " He taught me how to unfurlthe sails and run them up . It did n't look hard . " Let them stay awhile , an afternoon or so , " he said . " Bring the kids if you want . " Then he said , " Let 's take her out , shall we ? " " You mean right now ? " " Why not ? " " But it 's  --  now it 's almost evening , " I said . " We wo n't be long . " " All right , " I said . I was getting nervous . I felt fairly sure that he wanted to talk about Jeremy . Why else take me away from the children , and suggest a sail in that artificial voice that meant it was n't so spur-of-the-moment after all ? I wondered if Jeremy had fallen ill , or died , or found somebody else . I felt my hands growing cold , but I did n't tell Brian to break the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freezingto death on a warm summer afternoon , and Brian started the motor and steered us slowly out past the other moored boats . When we reached open water he cut the engine . The quiet rolled down over us like a bolt of silk . I could hear water lapping , ropes creaking , Brian doing something complicated to tighten the sails . Oh , everything was so unfamiliar ! I felt that this entire scene was foreign and bizarre , some trumped-up substitute for the world where Jeremy lived . Every move that Brian made , even the tone of his voice and the way his beard ruffled and parted in the wind , was makeshift ; nothing like Jeremy at all . When he came to sit down beside me the sheen in the unknown fabric of his shirt made me want to go home . He laid an arm across my back and his hand rested on my shoulder  --  a big , wiry hand , as unlike Jeremy 's as a hand               @ @ @ @ @ @
