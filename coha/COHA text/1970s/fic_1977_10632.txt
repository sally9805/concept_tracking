DEATH BY BEQUEST " Do n't worry , " he murmured consolingly , " people will think we 're old friends parting  --  everybody kisses everybody these days . Or husband and wife going their different ways before they meet again at home  --  " She felt he was talking to cover up some suddenly yawning gulf , some bewilderment as deep as her own . Following his proposed script , he held her close against his English trenchcoat , something underneath , a big , tall , agile , powerful man . He kissed her again , in open possession , and said cheerfully , intimately , very audibly ( they were after all being looked at in spite of his " everybody kisses everybody these days " ) and in retrospectunbearably , " I may be home a little late , I think I 'd rather have veal chops than steak , and seeing you like this weather so much you can take your turn to walk the dog .

She made a reluctant pulling-away motion and he immediatelydropped his arms . " I 'll be home a little late if I do n't .. " Let 's see , you 're downtown and I 'm going uptown , I 'll get you a cab  --  " his face curiously flushed , or maybe it was the reflection of the light turning red near them . Before she had time to frame a proper good night  --  and in any case what would that consist of ?  --  he was opening a yellow door and handing her in . " Good night , Celia . " He at least did it properly . " Enjoy it while it lasts , the snow , " and with a wave at her window as her cab pulled away , he was behind her , gone , in the first magical snowfall of the year . CHAPTER 3When Bernard Caldwell saw the death notice in the New York Times , called Laura Gore 's lawyer and found that he had not been so much as mentioned in her will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost him his job . He was a good salesman , enthusiastic , persuasive ; impervious to everyday resistance and even insult . He had sold farm equipment , chemicals , vitamins , motorboats , and cosmetics among other things , always working for large manufacturers . But there came a moment in each of the many jobs when the elastic band would stretch too far , and snap . He was skilled at writing objective-sounding references for himself . He made friends easily and always gave the name of a reliable buddy at his last job , in case his new employer wanted to check . The rages had cost him a wife and after her a blonde and a redhead . But there was no one to see him now , in the small bungalow he rented outside Trenton , New jersey , where he currently worked for Brinner Brothers , Everything for Bowling . I suppose it 's because of that time in August I said something , making a kind of joke about it , to the old hag , the sneakingold bitch , about hoping she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harsh indrawn breath , the needle glare of her eye  --  was his last coherent thought before he deliberatelylet himself go . He picked up the desk chair and smashed it against a window . Glass went crashing and two legs of the chair snapped off. 22 DEATH BY BEQUESTHe ripped the spread from the bed and  --  gratifying surge of muscular power-tore it in half . He hurled a heavy glass ashtrayat the kitchen door . It made a pleasing dent in the painted wood before it showered in fragments back over his feet . Do n't scream , do n't shout , someone in a passing car might hear him , even though his throat was bursting . He kicked the wastebasket and it shot across the rug dumping paper crumples and cigarette butts and ashes . Panting now , and beginning to tremble , he threw himself on the bed and stared at the ceiling . All those visits , all those years . The stinking dog , the dark house with everything covered up , the tea when he would have given his right arm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrill rasping voice going on , and on .. .

" He lay on his bed , daydreaming . A soft kind of kid she had been , Celia , yes that was her name , Celia . Maybe she was still that way . " Certainly , Bernard , I see your point , it 's only fair , " he heard her saying . That house . If the front door was scrubbed up , the brokenDEATH BY BEQUEST 23shutter replaced , those terrible old yellow darned lace curtains taken down  --  after all , it was a good block , the Gore house the only mild blemish on it  --  it should be worth at least sixty thousand dollars , maybe a hell of a lot more . Daydreaming got you nowhere . He had n't daydreamed the sale yesterday of six new bowling alleys to Trenton Fun and Games . He had gone out and made it . Too bad the desk chair was broken . He dragged over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his portable typewriter . Casting his eye about the room in search of the right approach , he noted the broken window and decided he 'd call the police and say the house had been vandalized while he 'd been away . That would square it with the landlord , he 'd have to reglaze the window , it was a medium-to-bad neighborhood , you had to expect this kind of thing on this kind of street . Mrs. Waldo St. Clair . It sounded odd , rich ; she probably had money , or her husband did , and the bitch would n't even need it . He 'd get her address from that voice-down-the-nose lawyer . This is for starters , he thought , feeling active , brisk , and reassuringlyin command of himself again . Just for starters . " Dear Cousin Celia , " he began , " I do n't know if you remember me , but " .. . " I 've had a most peculiar letter about that house , " Celia told Waldo . " Somewhere between a whine and a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose he 's some kind of cousin , a man named Bernard . " Waldo , lazy at his end of the sofa , snapped very delicately to attention . Ordinarily , when informed about letters she got , he would say , " In a sentence , please , " to spare himself any remote possibility of boredom . She waited for this request and instead he said , " What do you mean by some kind of cousin ? " 24 DEATH BY BEQUEST " Well , let 's see . " She really was n't concentrating . She was somewhere else , again . Waldo wondered impatiently if she had any idea of what had happened to her face , the pearliness that had come over it , the wash of beauty he had never seen before . Not that she was n't nice-looking in her quiet way , soft-speakingbrown eyes behind the solemn horn-rimmed glasses , dark witty eyebrows eloquent too , under a grave forehead . Loosely falling brown hair cut in a bell , silk-fresh and clean , looking as if a light wind had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amiable intelligent mouth , very fair skin which seemed almostblue when she was tired and was a dead giveaway , the color catching it , when she was embarrassed or happy . Or in love . When they had first been in love , he had said , " You come on misleadingly like a mouse . But then you turn into a windchimein a breeze , you hear  --  you notice  --  one faraway delightfulthing after another , your voice , your eyes . . . and that funny spilled-out laugh of yours ... " She closed her eyes ; partly to summon up Bernard and partly to avoid Waldo 's piercing glance . " Laura was my grandmother 's sister . Bernard 's grandmother was Laura 's own first cousin . That would make Bernard her first cousin three times removed and he 'd be my . . . " She paused . " Second cousin , the hell with the removes , " Waldo said . " Where 's the letter , I 'd like to see it . " She got up obediently and went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the envelope , shaking ashes from them . " Dear Cousin Celia , I do n't know if you remember me but we met as kids in what I jokingly used to call her , and she lapped it up , Great-cousin Laura 's house on Pine Street . Great cousin , get it ? Seems now there are only two survivors of that once mighty clan left in the whole wide world , and that 's you and me . She spoke of you very nicely , appreciated your visits , I can imagine what they cost you in time and patience , I knowDEATH BY BEQUEST 25what they cost me , God ! She was in some kind of a bad mood when I went to see her in August , and well you know how they are at that age , she must have done something or other to her will , she 'd told me often I 'd be well remembered in it , and now the old doll wipes me right off the slate . I know you 'll agree how unfair that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting around to put their fingers in the pot , there 's just as I said you and I. I 'm prepared to be reasonable if you are . I 'm in Trenton , two drinks away on the Penn Central from your town , and will be available for a friendly talk at any time . Hoping you 'll see that this is the only fair thing and that you 'll get in touch with me immediately if not sooner , and with recollections of what a nice little soft-hearted kid I remember you as , Yours , Bernard . " Under his written signature , as a memory freshener , was typed his full name , Bernard Caldwell , ioio Voss Road , Trenton , New Jersey , and his telephone number . Waldo 's silence puzzled her . " Are you thinking we ought to give him some money , five thousand , ten , when the house is sold ? " " Not at all , he has n't an earthly claim to it , the will is cut and dried , no loopholes , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " As sane as she ever was , " Celia said . " What does he look like , this Bernard ? " " Why . . . ? " " For God 's sake , Celia , do n't you get the cheery threat in the only two survivors ' and then he says it again ? Do n't you think it would help if you met him somewhere in a dark alley - to know what the other survivor looked like ? " He added , " He probably does n't know yet if you 're safely married , or divorced , widowed , alone ... " She could n't tell him that the letter had just barely floated over the level of her consciousness ; that there were other things , troubling delightful things , obsessing her , crowding everythingelse out . She had merely noted down his name and addressin her little green leather book and vaguely decided to26 DEATH BY BEQUESTtalk it over with Waldo ; Bernard 's claim seemed reasonable enough . Now she forced clarity and concentration on herself . " I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him was when I was eight and he was ten . He said , Let 's both of us go upstairs and take all our clothes off , and I said no , and he twisted my arm behind my back and hurt me horribly , I still remember it . . . fair-haired , though it could have turned dark or gray since then , nothing particular to notice about his face  --  " I 'll answer the letter , " Waldo said . " I 'll just tell him politelyto go screw himself . Two can play at the iron hand gambit , and my velvet glove will be of better quality than his . And "  --  he gave her an odd smile  --  " I 'm glad you started early in life , refusing improper invitations from the other sex , Celia . " It is impossible to fall in love while crossing Madison Avenue , in the snow , in a snarl of taxis , holding a hand . She assured herself of this many times the following day . The morning after that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work , at her drawing board . He was in her neighborhood , he said , and could he take her to lunch ? Easy and casual . Maybe he was trying to clear up impossibilities too . She said without fuss or hesitation that she would like to , and met him at a small pink-lit Italian restaurant three blocks from her office . He was at the bar . He came instantly to her and looked hard at her face , eyes moving over every inch of it , reminding her of his saying her name , quietly and clearly , identifying her , under the streetlight . " I have a table , unless you 'd rather have a drink at the bar first . . . no ? Give me your coat . . . " He checked it , pocketed the tab , lightly took her arm and moved her through the crowded buzzing room to a table in the corner where they sat side by side on tufted black vinyl . DEATH BY BEQUEST 27He had a way , Celia noticed even that early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'm better off with scotch in the middle of the day ... " To the waiter , " One dry martini , one scotch , bring the wateron the side , " and then without any kind of throat-clearing orany change of expression , and in a perfectly natural way , tookher hand where it lay on the tufted vinyl and closed his over it . Their drinks came . He kept her hand , managing his cigarette , lighter , and drink with his left . The public face , the private hand . She felt herself slipping , already almost lost ; she had been going to be brisk , conversational , a new friend made , there were lots of things she could talk about with him , the gallery , painting in general of which she had garnered a lot from Waldo and had ideas about her-selfAtfirst they talked very little , but looked at each other . " It 's hell having all these people around , " he said . " Does my face look strange ? " almost anxiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . . . Does mine ? " " Yes . Or maybe in all these years I never really looked at you before . Do you always go around with all ten wicks in your candelabralighted ? " That did it . She began to talk , too fast , in her well-informed soft intelligentway , about the lawsuit of the Rothko estate against the Marlborough Gallery . He ordered a second drink , listening eyes on her , not necessarily her voice but her face , her own eyes . " I suppose in a way it 's a landmark kind of case  --  " Do go on talking . She looked and tried not to be seen doing so , at his showing hand , the immaculate nails somewhere nicely between almond and square , the long fingers , the lightly growing reddish fair hair on the back of the hand , he must have been as a little boy an enchanting strawberry blond . Thin plain everyday watch , not showoff , no built-in calendar or eerie huge lighted nu-2S DEATH BY BEQUESTmerals . Crisp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his dark gray suit , simple square amber cufflink . The eyes , mountainy , somewhere between gray and blue in this lightPeople fall in love with their eyes . Look away . Love is recognition , perhaps the highest form of it . You . Look away again. ... and , what will it do to the good faith of other galleries " Yes , " he said , as if adeptly fielding a conversational point tossed to him . There was a faint thoughtful amusement at the corners of his mouth . " While you keep the ball in the air , I 'm down here on earth . In a way , that is . To think . . . I 've been to your apartment for dinner . You collect shells . You 've been  --  you and Waldo  --  to mine . You once had coffee in my office on a cold morning when you could n't get a cab and came in to warm up . I was invited over one Sunday to your place on Fire Island . You 'd gotten sunburned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some girl I brought with me had dinner without you , he cooked spaghetti and scorched it , he was burned too and had had a pot of martinis  --  " Thinking and not thinking about the possible reason for it , she had dressed very carefully that morning . A soft wool in a remote blue , scarved gracefully around her throat , pearls tangledcarelessly in the scarf , pearls dangling from her ears . Waldo watched her from the bed . He went in late most days , ten o'clock or so . " People do n't part with thousands before lunch , usually . " He said , " Turn around , I 'll be your mirror . You do n't use blusher as a regular thing , do you ?  --  you 've got a bit too much on . " She wielded a paper tissue . " There , you 're ready for any-thing . " He gave her her first recognizable pang of guilt . Cy watched her face as , remembering Waldo 's voice , from his pillows , she distractedly tucked back one swath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . The other swath flew and shone and feathered against her cheek whenever she moved her head . The moules a la mariniere arrived . She said timidly , " I think I 'll need my hand  --  " " You 're perfectly welcome to it for the time being  --  " He added severely , " Whatever that is , narcissus or something , that you have on , it tends to interfere with the wine and garlic . " And a moment later , as he caught her staring at the tablecloth , so far buried in him that she had almost forgotten who she was and who Waldo was , " Pick up your fork , do . I 'll race you to see who can finish the bowl first . And , if you insist on being social "  --  head tilted close to hers , and to hell with the watching eyes , people enjoyed watching lovers  --  " tell me in your madrigal voice , all about the fabric designing business . " Under the green canopy , as they lingeringly searched for farewellsthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buses accelerating , taxis racketing , he said , " The idea that I have to say goodbye to you is outrageous . " " Say goodbye . . . ? " Voice so low he could hardly hear her . " I mean , for now , for today . " It should n't have made her happy ; it could be trouble , enormoustrouble shaping up , shaking them all to the roots . Since marrying Waldo , she had not had a love affair or anything approaching it . But just this one afternoon , just for a few hours , she thought , I 'll let myself be this happy . When he called her at five o'clock she began to try , if feebly , to fight it . " Have you finished up your butterflies , Celia ? " A design she was working on that she 'd told him about at lunch . " Yes . . . no . . . almost  --  Cy , I think we should probably not talk at all , on the phone or anywhere , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , if you were going to ... " Wretched pause , maybe this was all one-sided and he would think her mad , interpreting their hand-holding lunch as somethingof profound importance . Everybody kisses everybody these days. 30 DEATH BY BEQUEST " You know that 's absolute nonsense , " he said . She could see him at his desk in the big handsome office , the walls jammed with pictures , his typing table at right angles to his desk , the Persian rug , smoke blue and amber , the books , the easel in the corner , the glass and metal tea cart beside it from which he leisurely dispensed , in this inner sanctum , sherry and gin and whiskey while canvases on the easel were studied . And Waldo in the next office , a smaller room , although he seldom stayed out there , but restlessly roamed the exhibition rooms , or pursued pictures and sculpture to far-ranging studios and lofts  --  but if he was there , Cy would be very sure to have his own door closed so he could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly and warmly . She felt a prickle of discomfort . " No , I mean it , if not for you then for me , I need it  --  I 'm not used to whirlwind things like this , although they may be part of your everyday week  --  " How bitchy that sounded , and all she had meant to do was let him know that she knew there might really be nothing in this to be taken seriously . There was a pause , and then he sighed , and made a sound that could have been a faint laugh . " All right , Celia , I have to go to London anyway for a few days , I wanted to see you at least once before I left , but  --  " And then firmly , " Good night . " Even that early , he was tempted to tell her about Waldo and Irena Tova . Without his having any particular interest in the matter , it seemed fairly clear , the pairing . But he hated to be the one to administer the hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vulnerable neck , under that sliding shining hair . " But of course you did n't know . The wife is always the last to .. : " CHAPTER 4There was a fury about Waldo 's lovemaking that both dismayedand pleased Irena Tova . As so often in the past six months , they had a lazy lunch in a small French restaurant a few blocks from her apartment , wine and omelet and fruit and cheese , and then went home and to bed . They would turn up at slightly different times from slightly different directions , later , at the gallery , both of them shining and contented . There was n't much contentment in the sparkling little green and white bedroom today . Irena sat up , stretched , and went pink and naked into the bathroom . He studied her sturdiness , the waist not at all narrow , breasts deep and firm . In a world of dieting women , she was slightly and he thought deliciously overweight , and perfectlyhappy about it . " The thing about you , Irena , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere between a worldly kind of girl , a hausfrau , and a comfortable old-fashioned whore . " Aware that he was leaving out the fourth Irena , tough , ambitious , acquisitive . Cy Hall had hired her . Her father was a good friend and clientof his . She had just gone through an unhappy divorce and wanted to work , get out into the world and breathe , she said . She had started at Hall and St. Clair as a sort of girl Friday , fetching coffee , watering plants , taking dictation and typing letters . After a while she had been allowed to try her hand at a littleselling , and then a little modest buying . She knew the field and loved it ; and soon from her mysterious international back-32 DEATH BY BEQUESTground came friends with money to spend , friends with picturesworth displaying . She was now solidly entrenched . As far as Waldo could gather , whe was a mixture of Hungarian , Dutch , and Jewish . Her father did n't believe in lazy young ladies lying about eating chocolates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her was lean and she worked not only because she wanted to but because she must . He was married to his second wife , twenty years younger than he , so the prospects in that direction were not promising . Added to which Irena 's stepmother detested Irena . Waldo felt for her something he could n't quite define ; he thought her as necessary to him as his heartbeat . And she had told him , in the faint accent that charmed male visitors to the gallery , " Do n't let it go to your head , Waldo , but you suit me . You really suit me . " She pronounced the w in his name somewhere between an f and a v.Rosier still from her bath , and shedding a faint mist of **25;4679;TOOLONG , she came back into the bedroom , composedly put on her pale green chemise slip deep in ivory lace , and prepared to ease her feet and short hard shapely legs into her pantyhose . " Come now , " she said . " Not that man this morning , Bloomgarden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he wants the Marisol , if Cy can be persuaded to part with it  --  " The first several weeks at work , she had tried , with Cy , but sensed a closed door at the end of that particular inviting corridor and turned her attentions to Waldo . " Are you going to collect your personal commission , in this bed , tonight ? I heard him muttering to you , about dinner  --  " " Look , as far as finances go , we 're penniless orphans , adrift . " Her penniless orphan 's condominium apaitnient had been paid for by her father but the stiff maintenance was up to her . " Who was the man who said , We live not as we will but as we must ? Work is work , Waldo , I do n't drive myself into a fury when one of your ladies looks sheets and mattresses at you . " She had a round face , the fair skin transparent , shimmering , and slightly protuberant very dark blue eyes . Her hair was aDEATH BY BEQUEST 33child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wings almost up to the corners of her eyes . She had a sensuous plump mouth , rosy on its own , and small sparkling white teeth . She exuded health and strength and always looked as if she had just stepped out of a sauna ; and to underline the deliberate sexinessthere was a fascinating suggestion of snowy apron , forearmsfloured as delightful things were baked , fragrance from her kitchen and from her freshly decanted wine . To his silence , she went on , " And you go home to your Celia every night , do n't you ? And I assume when you 're in the mood you fulfill your husbandly obligations ? We 've been over it and over it  --  by the way , get up , darling , and take your shower , and I 'll fix coffee , it 's getting on  --  " with a glance at her diamond watch , the source of which he had furiously wondered about . " Yes , over it and over it . Penniless orphans , as you say . And , also as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and married , or at least arranged to have every day all day and every night together , she would hardly extend the benefits of a steady salary to the two of us , not just me  --  " He stared blackly in front of him . " Even if I yanked out what 's left of my stake in the galleryit would n't last us a year and then what , and where , and how ... " " And neither of us fancies canned tomato soup , and instant coffee , and darning , whatever darning is . Yes , well then , no more sulks . " She went over and kissed him . A vital warmth and sustenance came from her . " And stop glaring and worrying . I 'm perfectly satisfied with the way we are , for the moment . " For the moment . He showered savagely , and then for the first time since they had become lovers he thought , Watch it , I 'll have to step carefullyhere , no point in starting her wondering where we 're heading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wasting valuabletime when she could be building some kind of nice little empire for herself ?

He came into the kitchen glowing and smiling from his34 DEATH BY BEQUESTshower , brushed and groomed , in his beautifully cut loden cloth suit and creamy challis shirt and deep green woolen tie polka-dotted in simmering red , noticeable but like everything else Waldo wore right . She always , just before they left the apartment , gave them hot fresh coffee , the best he had ever tasted , and little glasses of brandy . " There 's my own pristine Waldo back again . All right now ? " " Marvelous . " He gave her his merry smile . " For the mo-ment . " On the way downtown in the cab  --  " Drop me at Bergdorf 's , there was a gray thing in the window I must have , gray and white ostrich feathers at the hem , chiffon I think "  --  he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go to Philadelphiato an auction , and oh yes , to see about a house somebody'sleft to Celia .

Implying she might someday die . Contingency or not , he had a feeling that if he lost a thin case it would cost him money somehow or other , which he could n't afford . But there were other ways , for a man free to come and go . He stopped at a bar on the New York side of the Lincoln Tunnel and had several whiskies .

Something about his clothes and his carriage convinced Bernardthat this must be his man . He strode across the white marble floor and rudely joined the two . " Waldo St. Clair , is it ? " The woman in sables stared haughtily at the big heavy-shoulderedman in the slightly soiled raincoat and rakish broadbrimmedblack hat . He had a square overfed and overwhiskied face , hard blue eyes under hard derisive black eyebrows that met in the middle , and a nose that had once been good , bold , high-bridged , broken in a bar battle many years ago and not quite properly reset . It was at once an advantage and a disadvantageto him that he looked like and could have been so many other men . " No , it is not , " Cy Hall said calmly .

" With the other ear , he heard Waldo 's light crisp step on the marble floor of the room beyond ; he must have intercepted the raincoated man . Cy hoped that in case he was n't a maddened artist he had n't come in to rifle the safe . Not that there was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and priceless pictures , and he did n't look like an art connoisseur .. But he did look distinctly and deliberately threatening . However , you never could tell in this business . Last year about this time he had sold off the wall  --  or more accurately , accepted for confirmation the Fifth Avenue Bank check  --  a Franz Kline for $150,000 to a pale bald man in soiled sneakers and mended knitted string gloves who turned out upon later examination to be one of the Schuilthuises of Amsterdam and Southampton . The check was perfectly good . The off-duty ear heard accurately , Waldo 's " I was just on my way out , sorry , " and the other man , loud , harsh , " Well , first round , right ? You 're St. Clair . You write a hell of a letter , worse than any lawyer . " There was no one else in the gallery besides the four of them .

DEATH BY BEQUEST 37 " What do you mean , first round ? You make it sound like some sort of fight and I 'd thought there were n't even grounds for an argument . If I take your meaning correctly . Bernard - may I ? " The haze got redder ; something took over and he lifted his foot and there was a crash as a six-foot by eight-foot Hans Hoffman was kicked off the wall . Mrs. Wilberforce , charmed by what sounded like excitement , stayed close to Cy 's side as he strode into the middle room . " What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting up the painting off the floor , first things first , as though the big man with the balled fists a few feet from him did n't exist .

He had had several more whiskies to calm himself down with and after a moment felt nicely in charge of himself . " Good to see you after all these years , Celia .

In their absence all would be chaos . Principles being as much a matter of gluing civilization together as of personal ethics . But not for you , right now , to practice .

What can he do if you decide to divorce him ? " It was the first time the ultimate , decisive word had been spoken between them . " It 's  --  it has n't been , " Celia said in an astonished way , " much more than a month . . . " Her eyes grave behind the solemnround shining glasses , contemplating the word month , and along with it the question of what time had or had n't after all , to do with anything .

" He still had not told her about Waldo and Irena Tova . For a while , he had thought , maybe Waldo always has a girl on the side , maybe it does n't mean all that much to him , maybe she knows and prefers peace and quiet and a settled marriage to a face-to-face housewrecking brawl ; and maybe she 's had compensatingaffairs , couples have their own private ways of finding their balance . He had also though that perhaps what he was feeling could be dealt with and gotten over , get down to business , passion consummated , it 's been nice , love , you go your way and I 'll go mine , I do n't fancy breaking up other people 's marriages at the drop of a hatHe knew now that in this he was quite wrong , permanently wrong ; he had a ridiculous and raging feeling sometimes , wakingin the night , that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might at that very moment be committing adultery with an impostor named Waldo St. Clair . " As I said , " not threatening , but gentle , hand hard and warm , tightening on hers , " we ca n't go on like this . " He looked at his watch .

" At close to two , by the bedside clock , she felt Waldo stirring , and , first delicate tasting , the back of one hand slipping across her breasts . She had been awake but tried to make her voice sleepy . " Sorry , tonight , I 'm hors de combat . " A phrase inherited from her mother . Waldo raised himself from his pillow . There was enough light from the illuminated dial of the clock to show his mouth and eyes , ironic . " Funny , I thought that was all over two weeks ago , you said you were when we came home from that party  --  of course we 'd both had a lot to drink  --  maybe my dates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's only hope , Celia , that you 're not beginning to go through early menopause .

The door , not the downstairs bnzzerShe went and put her eye to the little glass hole that even the most confident and careless New Yorkers felt it a necessity to supply themselves with . The man , magnified but seemingly falsely to be standing at a distance , was her cousin Bernard . Oh , hell , she almost said aloud . But she had n't been careful with her feet , walking to the door , and the old , fine parquet creaked resoundingly . Waldo was at a gallery opening  --  " How you all do take in each other 's washing , " Celia said  --  or rather a loft spree with beer instead of champagne , in SoHo , south of Houston Street . She had no idea when he would be home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had just begun on her book but found herself unable to concentrate . She was , mentally , deep in Cy 's arms . DEATH BY BEQUEST 45She opened the door with reluctance . He moved in fast and aggressively as if he thought he had been going to be denied entrance . Under the diamond shower of light from the little crystal chandelier , he made a fast and to her offensive study of her face , her body , in long apricot silk jersey slit to the knee on either side , touching her and not touching her , depending on how she moved . " Gracious living , yet , " he said . " Waldo here ? " " No . " " Good . Just the family . My , you have " moving ahead of her into the living room  --  " a nice place here , " eyes raking the deep sofa , the mirrors , the pictures , the wall of books , the depths of blue in the Chinese scholar 's rug .

In on business , and I thought , now we 've met after all these years must look up old Celia . " He flung his raincoat over a low white chair and settled himself solidly on the sofa . " Scotch for me if you have it and do n't spare the horses . It 's cold as a sonofabitch out there . " As she poured his scotch , Celia thought , What a lovely familyI have .

The apartment was on the secondfloor of the brownstone , at the front , looking over a very quiet street . He was gratified by the flicker of doubt , of a kind of remote fear , in the large dark eyes behind the glasses . Bet she 's as blind as a bat without them , he thought . Helpless . It was interesting to see that his cousin Celia , woman of the world , money , fancy apartment , wearing what he supposed were at-home clothes even if she was here all by herself , was n't tough like a lot of New York women were . And that she frightenedeasily . But what nonsense , Celia told herself . To feel exposed and invaded , threatened , just because an unattractive relative had landed himself on her on a night when she had been so happily alone and not alone . A bore . That was all it was .

" And you have n't even touched your drink . " DEATH BY BEQUEST 47She sat down somewhere between the cushion beside him and what would have been a forbidding huddle into the far end of the sofa . " We were just getting warm the last time we talked . You saying probate would take a bit of time , so that we could n't settlematters until that went through .. : ' " That is n't quite what I said .

" " Yes , " Celia said , wanting to push the dead room , the dead house , the dead aunt away from her forever ; a stain on the warmth and joy that had been enfolding her before the doorbellrang . " She hauled herself out of her chair after her second glass of sherry and pulled one of the covers off and showed me a chair , you 'd think it was the throne of the Queen of England the way she talked about it , she said it was a Philadelphia chair , and all I thought was , so okay , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ... d' you mind if I fix myself another small one ?

With a sudden soft little brutal motion , he snatched off her glasses . Just as he 'd thought , the eyes with the confused melting softness of the extremely nearsighted ; and in her case beautiful . This close , a kind of brandy color , was the way he put it , the48 DEATH BY BEQUESTlight behind the bar gleaming through a precious and expensive bottle . Thick short heavy lashes like silk , and what he though of as Core eyebrows . " For God 's sake  --  " Strangled fury in her voice , as she dove at his hand for her glasses .

And added , hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if there was more of that stuff there , along with her tacky old odds and ends ? " He had been sorely tempted to hire a U-Haul truck and park it in front of the house and go in and investigate and help himself . Not , he conceded , that he 'd know the good stuff from the bad but just grab it anyway , on the offchance . He was in possession of a tempting front door key , acquired so long ago he had forgotten the circumstances . But there were deterrents . A cautious phone call to the house was answered by the aged black maid , Vera . Mr. Waldo St. Clair , she said , wanted her in residence until the house was sold . He knew she was protectively , passionately fond of Miss Celia , he 'd had to listen to her on the subject all too often .

Enough to buy a business for himself . He knew of a nice little Ping-Fong ball factory in Patersongoing begging ; if he did n't pick it up soon , someone else would grab it .

In every affair , he considered , what mattered vitally was who had the upper hand , who called the turn . Who had the better balance on the tightrope . Up until now , he had been dominant . In the cab , he painted awful pictures for himself of what was happening or would be happening at Bloomgarden 's apartment .

Sliding off to sleep , Waldo murmured urgently into her hair , " Two days , thank Christ , only two days , and then ... " There was the sound of furiously fast typing from Cy 's office . His door was closed . The gallery was empty , morning-immaculate , smelling faintly of wax . Irena when she achieved her own mild eminence in their setup had not abandoned the plants ; they had been freshly watered and sprayed , and they glistened dewily in the cold December sunlight coming in .

And then this journey abroad  --  did she suggest it , with the idea of  --  no matter what you say , and I ca n't imagine you married to a stupid woman  --  some reunion , reconciliation ?

The Tova money , not that it did Irena much good , came out of armaments in the Ruhr ; but he saw that for the moment she was serene and purring again , hands very lightly stroking his hair . " I 'm looking forward to our celebration . " It was a busy morning . Christmas shoppers  --  mostly just shopping and not buying  --  strolled the white marble floors .

The sound of typing continued undiminishedfrom Cy 's office . At eleven , he came out and went over to Waldo . " Sorry to do this to you at this late date , " he said , " but I ca n't make it after all and you 've inherited the trip . " " What trip ? " Waldo asked in instant and well-founded alarm . There was to be an auction late that afternoon in Manchester , Vermont . " The collection rates Sotheby Parke Bernet but she 's very old and insists that it be done at home , hell of a place to get to , dealers coming from California and every which way  --  Wahlgren is interested in the Veronese and I promised I 'd see what we could do for him . . .

If he was a partner , he was very much a junior partner , financially speaking ; and Pierre Wahlgrenwas one of the gallery 's best customers . Goodbye birthday party , and a warm and peaceful tying up of odds and ends with Irena , a restoring of the right footing with her . And almost in panic he remembered that he would n't be able to have her for lunch and love tomorrow . It was her weekly ballet class and she was always adamant about it . She was standing just a few feet away ; she must have heard him getting his marching orders . " If you 'll come along to the office I have a note somewhere of our top bid and his top price ...

" " No , but it makes a nice anniversary . " Ten miles from where they were lunching , abstractedly and without appetite on either side , was Cy 's brother Peter 's house . " Nice and quiet , three fireplaces , " Cy had said on the way up in the car . " You sound like a rental agent ... " Celia tried whisperingly for gaiety and felt at first only secrecy and guilt .

" At four-thirty on the afternoon of December i7 , Cecelia Margaret Gore St. Clair and Cyril Francis Hall committed adultery , with a great and consuming and decisive delight . Celia , usually so good about packing , was going about it slowly . Waldo looked at his watch . " You have half an hour more , and then one drink , and then the cab . " " Yes , all right ...

Waldo went over to him and said rudely , " We 're just leaving , is there anything I can get for you in a hurry ? " " Anything brown  --  scotch , rye , blend , " Bernard said , looking around him in a bewildered way . " Leaving for where ? " " Abroad . " DEATH BY BEQUEST 59 " Abroad .

It 's a small country , he told himself , it wo n't take me long to find them . They had a tall stiff bloody mary at Shannon Airport , flew on to Dublin , took a Mercedes cab in the astonishing pitch dark to the Shelboume Hotel on St. Stephen 's Green , and in their usual first-day manner , after Celia had unpacked for both of them , fell promptly into bed to sleep .

Celia woke in her twin bed , marvelously rested , at four o'clock , blinked , told herself where she was , and listened to the showering sounds from the bathroom . Waldo came into the room looking freshly minted , shaved , and immaculate , his skin rosy under the olive . She watched him , in his tulip-printed chair , pulling on his knee socks and then musing through his closet and taking out a pencil-striped dark gray flannel suit with a vest . White shirt with severe small black dots , currant-red wool tie . Watching him windsor-knot it , absorbed in his reflection in the pier glass on its white stand , she thought in a peculiarly objective fashion , he really is a very attractive man . " Tonight , all play and no work , " Waldo said . " If you 'll everDEATH BY BEQUEST 67get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll buy you a drink , or several , and we will both wallow in Dublin Bay oysters , and then maybe sole grilled on the bone . And Guinness . " Not only an attractive man , a sweet and companionable one , most of the time , when a mood , a darkening of the spirit , was n't upon him . But , as though there were n't two of everybody . There were two of her . One was perched on the stool at the Shelboume bar beside Waldo . Recording with pleasure the sapphire etched glass panels rising from the broad-breasted mahogany bar , making in effect a semi-private little booth of each pair of stools . The tufted black leather banquettes against the dark shining walls  --  real leather , it was nice getting used to things that were n't fake , while traveling . The soft warm lights , the festive little clink of Waldo 's drink against hers , the first cold taste of an authoritative martini .

The wicked little counter-conscience said , With me he can go on doing what he loves , at the gallery , even when the pickingsare slim there , we 're financially okay even if not up to our knees in money . No , not two of her , but three . The third one , detached , intelligent , self-knowing , standing off at a little distance so that the voice was almost too low to catch , You know very well something has started that wo n't and ca n't be stopped .

" All right , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off to the Gresham for our oysters ? " " Yes , please , Waldo . " He deliberately turned his side to the girl across the bar and touched his fresh glass to hers . " Your health , darling . " " And to . . . our almost-fifth anniversary , " Celia said . CHAPTER 9They were on their way , in the midnight darkness of six o'clock in the evening , to the house of an artist named Kelley Kelly , somewhere to the east of Malahide on the coast north of Dublin . Waldo had said he was going to spend a leisurely day in what galleries he could find- " Go shopping or something , Celia , I know after your third gallery you 're fed to the teeth "  --  and hired a small black Mercedes for them . Not an addict of shopping , she had wandered the streets , studied thrushes and finches beside a pond in St. Stephen 's Green , spent an absorbed half hour in a bookshop on Dawson Street , and bought , when it started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slickers of her childhood , with toggles to fasten it and a soft little black corduroy collar . It was a very pretty coat , and highly visible . It was raining now , the soft straight-down Irish rain that felt as if it was coming without malice from a giant watering can held directly over your head . Waldo was a fast but stylish driver . He knew the coast road well ; he had , while in college , spent summers with a friend at the friend 's aunt 's house , a great stone Georgian manor near Howth . They had turned to the east and were climbing a hill betweenwoods when the engine made a peculiar sound . Waldo swore under his breath , topped the hill and began to descend it . The sound grew more pronounced . He drove the car onto the grass verge at the left , got out and lifted the hood . Celia70 DEATH BY BEQUESTwatched his intent face in the light of the headlamps , herself unworried ; Waldo was unexpectly good with cars , with any kind of machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . The rain poured down on his dark shining head . He got into the car and tried to start it . A cough , and then silence . " Christ , this would have to happen at the end of nowhere , " he said . He tried three more times . Nothing . There was no light in the darkness around them ; there were no reassuring ycllow squares of windows promising telephones , shelter , help . " I 'll have to hunt up a telephone booth or , do n't laugh , there may be a garage around somewhere , new since my time here . " " Shall I come with you ? " Celia asked . " What , in those sandals ?  --  and somebody might pinch the car . Keep your fingers crossed for me .

She was hungry and thirsty and bored , but had been telling herself that , while traveling , these things happened , you had to take them in stride . Rain began to blow in the open window beside her and she closed it , increasing her sense of isolation . Now there were not even sounds to be heard , branches creaking in the soft wind , a remote whistling snort : a horse . Breakfasting in their room , Waldo had favored her with bits and pieces out of the Irish Times . " Very little crime in this country , " he said , " but they save up what they have to offer in that line until we arrive , " and read in his usual shorthand fashion , " Armed robbers ... escaped from an English prison ... bank clerk in Skerries shot to death ... " DEATH BY BEQUEST 71Skerries . Not far up the coast from Malahide . Silly to begin to feel a far-off nervousness and an increasing aloneness . It was just the beat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being in a strange country , and the feeling of , bathed in the dashboard lights , appearing from without to unseen eyes like a decoy duck . There was a clanking and a near snort on the hillside behind her . She recognized from pictures she had seen a tinker 's caravan , but not one they 'd put in brochures for tourists , stained with dirt and rain , the horse impossibly old , how could the poor thing pull such a weight ; dim figures in a huddle visible through the open back . The caravan pulled up ahead of her and what was at first an unfrightening figure approached the Mercedes : a tall strong young woman with tousled wet red hair , a child of two or so slung on her hip , carelessly exposed to the pouring rain . She motioned at Celia to open her window . Thinking some kind of emergency help was wanted  --  the child sick ?  --  Celia rolled it down . A strong grubby hand was thrust under the nose . " Alms , for the grace of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Waldo for dropping offerings into any outthrust palm . " Coffee , a cup of soup , hell , they 'll just head for the wine . " She had often felt that this extreme concern for the proper sobriety of the ragged and down covered a small personal meanness when resorted to by the scolders . But the harsh aggressiveness of the woman put her off . Not a request ; a demand . She felt unwillingly in her raincoat pocket and found only two coins . There was nothing between change and the five-pound notes and travelers checks in her wallet . Waldo had had his pocket picked last year and was now unwilling to carry money himself , but on the other hand liked to have plenty of it available . " You be the banker , Celia . " " Should n't that child be covered up ? " she asked , trying to figure out how much or how little the silver represented ; she had n't quite mastered the currency system . " Ah , he 's used to it . " The dirty hand closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman studied , with an air of incredulity , the alms she had been given . Her voice rose to a shriek . " Ye ca n't mean itl You with the fancy car and fancy coat , all nice and dry and warm , all brushed and fed and tidy , and the boy "  --  she rattled the twoyear-oldon her hip like a weapon  --  " cryin ' for his bit of por-ridge  --  " " I do mean it , " Celia said with the fury of the kindhearted when roused . The woman spat on the coins and threw them to the ground . She raised one arm high , and in a chanting voice as one pronouncing an unholy ritual cried , " The curse of God be upon you . The curse of God be upon your man . The curse of God be on your children and your children 's children and all who you love . " Adding in a practical everyday way , " And I hope you break your leg . " She bent abruptly to retrieve the thrownaway money and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the caravan , in the rain . Before it started off , with more clankingand another despairing snort from the horse , a rough-haired young man appeared from the streaming woods with a gun cocked over his arm and a burlap bag , dripping something dark in the headlights , an animal 's blood , in his hand . He jumped into the back of the caravan . Just as it rumbled down the long hill , almost out of reach of the headlights , she saw him jump out again , with his gun . To kill something else , Celia thought , and with another bag dripping blood rejoin his conveyance around some agreed-upon bend in the road . Probably . The feeling of being enclosed and trapped , bathed in light in the blowing darkness , a woman alone  --  you with the fancy car and the fancy coat  --  forced her to open the door and get out and move away from the car into the shielding spruces beside the road . Before this instinctive escape , she had looked at her watch ; itDEATH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , not to look at it , just be patient , just wait , Waldo would be along momentarily  --  He had been gone twenty minutes . From not very far away , there was the terrifying crack of a shot , filling the night , coming from every direction . Had the tinker man , then , circled around her , had he shot at the car ? Without thinking , she turned and ran like an animal into the cover of the woods . " The curse of God be upon you  --  ' Right now ? It was , she decided later , one of two stupid things she could have done . The other would have been to sit , illumined invitingly , in the car . She could n't switch off the lights because she would be asking on bended knee for another near or direct-hit sideswipe . No question of running , with the uneven sloping ground , thickly treed . It could be a little hill of forty feet or so or an enormous plunge into a distant valley , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way blindly from tree to tree , each bole feeling like a mothering fortress ; if you were flattenedagainst it the less chance there was for the now silent gun to find you . If , at all , it wanted you . This was Ireland , safe sweet Ireland . The peaceful republic , not the violent bloody north . And the tinkers shot and killed animals , birds , for the only acceptable reason : to fill empty stomachs . I 'm a live rabbit frightened by a dead rabbit , Celia told herself , trying to tease away the primitive fear of the hunted , the doomed . Somewhere , blessedly , " Celia ! " Waldo 's voice . From behind her ? Or to the right ? The wind , rising now , distortedthe cry . " Waldo ... " more a released scream too long held in than a locating answer . Another shot , close . Dear God , Waldo mistaken for a rabbit or taken for his money ; or thought to be somebody 's estate agent after poachers and being warned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream , do n't send out an invitation to the man with the gun . She had no idea whether she had been making her way through the trees parallel to the road , where Waldo should be , or at right angles away from it . She did n't dare call his name again but started , in what seemed to be a clear space , from the sound of the rain  --  no stir and loom of branches overhead , no protection from the blanketing pour , only sighing high grass  --  to run uphill . Uphill must be right , to get back to light , safety , Waldo . Until now , she 'd been going down . There was someone behind her , close , running . She wanted to cry WalWs name again but her throat would n't let her . Trees or no trees , she flung herself forward . The burlap bag dripping darkness , the small extinguished life , for the hungry pot . . . This must be what the rabbit felt before extinction , a blindness , a blankness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape . Or were they just erect , resigned , saying , All right , death . There was a sudden tremendous flare in her eyes which she thought , fleetingly , was some kind of giving-in of the brain . A soft voice , male , said , " I do n't suppose by any unlikely chance you 've seen a three-legged beagle , ma'am ? " And then seeing her frantic face , " Ah , sorry , you 're in trouble , and who is it that  --  " The light from his huge flash went yards behind her to find Waldo , sprawled full-length over a bony protruding tree root , gasping and wiping water out of his eyes with the back of his hand . " Oh God , oh Jesus , Celia  --  " He ran to her and held her . She had never felt Waldo shaking all over before , and in a way it forced hysteria away from her . She put comforting arms around him . " I thought you might have been shot  --  I did n't know whereDEATH BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run to you , not away from you  --  Waldo , it 's all right  --  ' She hoped that the kind rescuing man with his light thrown upon darkness would find his three-legged beagle . Waldo raised the hood again , hands still shaking , took a small metal object from a Pliofilm envelope and bent to the engine , raising his voice over the rain to Celia , talking faster than he usually did . " He could n't come along himself , busy with his wife and the midwife , the thirteenth child and he looked as if I was to congratulatehim ! Thank God he had the part , anyway ... what on earth made you leave the car with all these guns around ? " As they started off , smoothly now , she tried to explain without a great deal of success fears that sounded frail , unreal , the sense of being vulnerable to some unknown thing in the lighted car in the night , and the acrid aftertaste of being cursed down the generations by a redheaded woman from a tinker 's caravan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're included . " He seemed far away , only half-listening . He looked drawn and pale . She felt a surge of guilt at frightening him the way she had , running from him , thinking he was doom at her heels . " That was thoughtful of her , " he said , and lapsed into silencefor the rest of their journey . Kelley Kelly was a gentle mild man . His wife had the face and air of a hellion . They lived in a small stone house on a hill , also inhabited by three Airedales , four cats , and a cageful of finches . The room smoked from a badly drawing fire of damp peat ; the clutter and dust were remarkable . Celia knew immediately that dinner when provided would be frightful . A considerable amount of gin was consumed before the eyestingingfire , and then they went out to the stone studio behind the house . Kelley Kelly 's present phase was huge semi-abstract canvases of blurred birds , in rain and cloud and haze , a confu76 DEATH BY BEQUESTsion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Waldo bought two of them ; prices were discussed inaudibly in a far comer of the studio . The telephone rang while they were having one last drink before dinner . Mrs. Kelly was rudely examining Celia , head to toe , as her husband handed the phone to Waldo . No privacy was possible ; the instrument was on a table beside the fireplace . " Irena . " Neutral low voice . " Yes ... " " Let 's talk a bit so he can transact his business in peace  --  Look at her , Kelley , " waving a derisive hand at Celia . " Look , the way she ca n't take her eyes off the man , she 's in love . How nice to be all flushed up in love with your husband after  --  how many years ? " " Five . " She just saved herself from putting her hands to her hot face . Of course , Cy would n't be coming on , from New York , and under no circumstances could he ask for her .. " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " After all , we ca n't all take top honors as the parish bitch . " He said this to his wife with a fond smile . She continued to stare at Celia , over Waldo 's yeses and noes and that's-goods " Tell Mrs. Donahue I 'm hot on the trail and I 've already bought three picturesfor her . " And his soft cool , " Well , then , goodbye , Irena Katrina , " which was understood by the two of them as , Darling , I love you and I miss you and I 'm half-dead without you . " My God , the potatoes , " Mrs. Kelly shrieked . " Am I the only one who smells something burning ? " . At a table occupied in addition by two squatting cats , they ate the potatoes , which their hostess unsuccessfully tried to descorchwith vinegar , greasy fried smelts , and canned spinach under a heavy fall of nutmeg . Waldo entertained them with his tale of the lost three-legged beagle and the tinker woman 's curse . " Undeserved , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth full of smelts . " The point is not to believe in it . If you do believe in it , it works , and many 's the time I 've seen it work , people just withering and wasting . " DEATH BY BEQUEST 77She added with ghoulish glee , " If it had been me , now , in the woods , dark and all , guns around and Kelley here hard behind me , I think he might have seized the golden opportu- nity of doing away with me , who 'd know who was responsible ? And then he could spend the rest of his days with the egg girl , admit it , Kelly , you have an eye for the egg girl . " " For Jesus ' sake , woman , he 'll want his money back , " Kelly said . " Everybody sit still while I get us some brandy and we 'll drink curses and murderers away . " When they got back to the Shelbourne , there was a telegram for Celia at the desk . She did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no choice . " Now you 're the one with the shakes , " he said . " Here , give it to me , " and took the envelope away from her . It had been sent from New York . It said : " Following you . Bernard . " No dates , no times , no places . Waldo sighed . " Persistent bas- tard . It 's a good thing I marred you for your income and not for your family connections . " " If he 's going to make it his life 's work to hector us , " Celia said , " I thought we 'd hand the house over to him  --  let him take care of selling it , after all that 's what he does for a living , selling . If he got a decent price we could give him a cut  --  you can figure out how many thousands would keep him quiet . I wo n't have him forever at our heels .

" In a manner not usual with her , but bruised and tired by her evening , her night , her dinner , and her longing thrust back and pushed away , she said in a small hard voice , " It 's my house , Waldo . " He changed tactics . " We 're both tired , let 's drop it for the moment and drop into a bedtime scotch in the bar . Following78 DEATH BY BEQUESTyou , indeed . What d' you suppose he means ? In his thoughts ? In his prayers ? Or in his too solid flesh ? " He had got himself back again and was absurdly pleased with his speculations about Bernard . The simple message , participleand pronoun , had felt a little different to Celia : in an understatedway threatening . CHAPTER 10Bernard got his own share of heavy headwinds and turbulence , crossing the Atlantic . He studied his planemates with haughty aversion and said to himself , bunch of parlormaids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very fat woman beside him unwrapped three hot pastrami sandwiches which breathed at him as she consumed them . Wrong nationality , those sandwiches . He thought it and then said it aloud and was rewarded by a pale blue glare and a bridling of massive shoulders . At Shannon Airport , he hoisted himself onto a bar stool without the grace of the St. Clairs and ordered their morning arrivaldrink , a bloody mary , from the same bartender . " You can keep the Atlantic Ocean , " he said to the bartender after his first gulp . " Thank you . A nice bit of real estate . And while you 're at it , does that include offshore oil rights ? " In his lonely way , Bernard fell into a conversation with him . Yes , he was visiting relatives here , rich relatives . As a matter of fact , just between us , there are expectations .. . He had been drinking whiskey all night . His head felt like a balloon . After his bloody mary , he wandered about the duty-free shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persuasionsof other pitchmen . He bought himself a Black Watch tartantie , a sterling silver shamrock tiepin , and an **26;4706;TOOLONG tweed hat . For Celia , he bought as what he called a sweetener a bottle of Lanvin 's Arpe'ge toilet water . After the short plane trip to Dublin Airport , he checked in at his small shabby hotel off O'Connell Street . He was tempted8o DEATH BY BEQUESTto go out and find a comfortable body but resisted it . This was a foreign country , you might catch something . And in any case you want to get a good solid rest , fella , from now on you need your wits about you . Because it 's now or never . It took Celia a while , on that late morning of wet crisp air and thin sun , to figure out why Dublin at Christmastime reminded her of Dickens . There was a mysterious and all-pervading deep acrid odor , and a haze , part moisture and part diffused smoke , which made the ruddy brick buildings on the street she walked look like old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not from any personal experience that she identified the smell and the blur in the air : soft coal burning , cheap , long since banished from more affluent cities . But it did put you squarely back in the past in a way that was not unpleasant . As always when strolling , she had her notebook with her , and paused to sketch the pattern of a railing here , a cornice there , the dappled design of rusticated stonework . From O'Connell Street , she made her way up busy Grafton Street , with its shops and swarms of Christmas shoppers , to the bare-boughed quiet of St. Stephen 's Green . There , with expensive hotels nearby , the Royal Hibernian , the Shelbourne , the Russell , the soft-coal smell seemed to vanish . She was sitting sideways on a bench trying in her notebook to record the pewter-silver bole of a beech tree  --  or no , it looked more like the pelt of a glistening wet seal  --  when a long shadow , and a footfall , made her look back over her shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bernard , hands in his raincoat pocket , came to stand over her . " You really meant that telegram literally , did n't you , followingus , " she said angrily . He sat down beside her and put an arm across the back of the bench , behind her shoulders . " I was a long way behind you when I spotted you on O'ConDEATFIBY BEQUEST 81nell Street . I 've just gotten out of bed , could n't sleep on that bloody crammed plane , and my legs are n't up to speed yet . Anyway , I saw you stopping to draw things , and I did n't want to interrupt while the iron was hot  --  but greetings , Celia , I told you we 'd keep in touch . " His approach was apparently unchanged : a false , grinning assumption of family ties backed up by a promise of **32;4734;TOOLONG . And by an unspecified physical threat , the secret following , the arm almost touching her shoulders , the big ill-treated yet still powerful body too close , indecentlytoo close . Reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she managed to move a few inches from the heavy warm thigh . " I had time due me , " he explained , " and I thought , what the hell , I 've never been out of the U.S.A. unless you count Korea , why not see what old Celia and Waldo are up to , get together . Maybe look up my mother 's cousin in Galway although I doubt she 's worth a penny , probably chickens in the parlor and a pig in the bedroom . What d' you say we three gather round for dinner , I brought along some letters and things you and Waldo might be interested in , to get back to the matter of the old bitch 's leavings  --  " " I wish to God the place would burn to the ground , " Celia said childishly , and then regretted having been so recklessly open , so easily victimized . He looked startled . " What , for the insurance ? We could think about it , but I do n't think it would bring a lot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " He winked at her . The undisguised villainy , in someone else who had nothing to do with her , might have been amusing . " About dinner , " recovering herself , " will you telephone the Shelbourne at say five o'clock ? Waldo 's lined up a number of artists and we may be spoken for . " Enraging not to be able to say , Go away , get lost , I do n't want to have dinner or anything else to do with you ever , you 're a total stranger and I do n't like you . At all . Or , more82 DEATH BY BEQUESTdirectly , to borrow ( censored ) from Waldo , go screw yourself , Bernard . Still not entirely sober , Bernard said , " I was going to suggest a drink , noon 's staring us in the face , but you look like you 're on the wing . To get Waldo 's appetite for dinner up , you might say to him , call it a kind of code  --  Adela 's on Seventy-sixth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or canopy , rather  --  anyway , lousy place , Adela 's , for my money , nothing but omelets , I stopped in one day after I  --  " He seemed , abruptly , to hear what he was saying and looked chagrined . " Cards to the chest , Bernard , " he solemnly informedhimself . " Forget it , Celia . " With an air of purpose , people to be met on time , pressing things to be seen to , she got up and left him with a brief cool goodbye . On her way to the corner of the Green nearest Dawson Street , she examined the cards he clutched to his chest . Not very hard to read , if he was n't making it up . Waldo , omelet lunch with somebody , and then around the corner , a yellow canopy , an apartment house  --  people did n't go to two restaurantsat midday . From the accompanying leer , and " call it a kind of code " she filled in a woman , and from his point of view a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary clientlunch , Waldo was a entertaining professional luncher . A demitasse and brandy at someone 's apartment  --  " Do you think this would be a good place to hang the Matisse ? " Without her working at it , Irena sprang into her mind . Attractive , very , in a basic glistening healthy way . Waldo 's daily workmate . Celia herself worked with pleasant personable men and knew the pull of mutual interests , shared coffee , company laughter and gossip . Before she could stop herself , she thought in perfect naked honesty , How wonderful that would be , for Waldo and me . How absolutely wonderful . At close to five o'clock , she was having her bath and Waldo was studying a painting he had bought in a gallery on DameDEATH BY BEQUEST 83Street . He did n't like it much but he thought Mrs. Donahue would love it . A ruined stone manor house clasped in ivy , under brooding poplars , with a woman in white , dimly seen , infinitely lonely , looking in at a yawning dark window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all apologize to himself for it . There was a loud unrefined knocking at the door . He got up to open it to Bernard and the two men exchanged stares . Waldo had been trying on a heavy linen hacking coat in oatmeal color which Celia had bought him , as a present , on approval . He wore this with pale blue boxer shorts  --  he had n't gotten around to his trousers  --  and black knee socks . " Well , deshabille , " Bernard said , making an unsuccessful stab at the pronunciation . " Did Celia tell you about getting together for dinner ? " He moved aggressively into the room , five inches taller than Waldo and a third again his size . " I thought I 'd come around instead of phoning , seemed friendlier  --  and then I thought if you did happen to be tied up we could at least have a sociable drink together , up here . " His gaze went around the rose-colored sitting room with its ruby and orange cannel-coal fire in the grate , and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say you know how to make yourself comfortable .

Which we are n't , to you . " He walked to the door and stood with his hand on the knob . Celia , hearing their voices , came into the sitting room in a white robe . " I told you to call first , Bernard , " she said mildly  --  there was something that made her feel vaguely guilty about his tired uncared-for look in this warm charming room  --  " and we are going out , as I 'd expected . " " Well , let 's have a drink anyway before you go , I 'll order u DEATH BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . As a matter of fact " - he felt in his breast pocket , under his raincoat  --  " I have something to show you you might be interested in . " Waldo lightly put his manners back on . " I very much doubt we would , but take off your coat and sit down , we have twenty minutes or so . " He went to a walnut cabinet and took out glasses and a bottle of scotch , lifted the telephone and ordered ice . With his customary boldness , as he made the drinks , he asked , " And what brings you to Ireland , Bernard , besides familyties ? " " Business brings me . What makes the world go round brings me , " Bernard said . " Money . " " And what are you selling or trying to sell now in the line of business ? Besides mysterious documents in your pocket . " " I 'm at the moment in bowling alleys , " Bernard said defiantly . " And collateral equipment . But I 've got my eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I intend to get some cash together and buy it . " " I think you 've come to the wrong place , I thought they left here to go and find the streets paved with gold . " " I think I 've come to the right place , " Bernard said , and raised his glass . " Cheers . " He had sat down gingerly on a French open-arm chair upholstered in rose and ivory silk . His saluting glass had the air not of a festive gesture but a fist shaken in the face . " Now then , " Waldo said . " What 's that in your pocket , to while away the cocktail hour ? " Reaching , Bernard said fumblingly , " It 's only one of a lot of things that I  --  However , a step at a time . No point in going to court and letting the legal eagles get at it , they 'd eat the house up between them  --  much better a peaceful settlement among us .

To Celia I 'm obviously a burden she picks up once or twice a year  --  although I 'm only a train ride away  --  and as there are only the two of you naturally I spend a great deal of time comparing the attentions offered a lonely sick old woman who happens to have even at her age an excellent memory  --  " " I do n't believe it , " Waldo said amiably , lazily . " Not that it means a damned thing , the woman 's wanderings , but I suspect you 're making it up as you go along . " Savagely , Bernard thrust the soiled paper at him . Waldo gave it a careless glance , crumpled it in his fist , and tossed it accuratelyinto the heart of the fire . There was a pale yellow flame dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gray ash . " Just as I thought , " Waldo said . " Fabrications , to put it po-litely . " Celia had never before seen a man 's jaw literally drop . Pouring obscenities , Bernard shot to his feet , reached into his suit coat pocket for something , and threw it . It just missed Waldo 's head and crashed against the wall , and a flood of the fragrance of rock-garden flowers drenched the air : Arpege . She heard herself cry out , saw Bernard , towering over Waldo , snatch him to his feet , fist raised ; and then another cry , Bernard 's , as Waldo raised a ruthless and accurate knee . Bernardbent double and stumbled back and then inarticulate with rage and pain made as if to fall again on Waldo when there was a light knock on the door . It opened and an elderly maid said , " Sorry to disturb you , will I just turn back the beds for you  --  " and examined the scene , the great panting man , the nice-looking one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the young woman clutching her white robe , and the smell , dear God , sickening really . They can say what they like about the Irish , she thought , but these Americans drink too much . Outwardly unruffled , she went on into the bedroom and could be seen folding the spreads and turning back the white linen sheets with composed hands. 86 DEATH BY BEQUEST " All right , your round , " Bernard said thickly . He reached for his raincoat and pulled it on . " And with Celia here-we men can get together privately , some other place , a bit later , there are things not quite fit for a lady 's , a wife 's ears  --  even though , these days  --  " " Get the bloody hell out of here and stay out , next time I 'll have the police on you , " Waldo said . Celia thought it might perhaps be too bad for Bernard that he did n't know Waldo better , and necessarily could n't read the white patches under the olive , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostrils . After Bernard 's door-slamming exit , waves of violence overlaidwith overpowering sweetness still filled the room . The maid , in the doorway , said , " I 'll just get a brush and pan and clean up your nice bottle of broken scent . " After she had gone , Celia said , " Why did you burn his letter , Waldo ? Candy from a baby  --  " He turned sharply at the musing sound of her always soft voice . " That , and your knee . " She looked distressed . " To your first question , I wanted to show him whom he 's dealing with . You seem singularly unable to dispose of him and life is too short to put up with the Bernards of the world . " " But there was nothing to be afraid of , I 've gotten the same kind of letter about him , from her , and if there was any direct promise of property you can be sure that would be the first thing he 'd read to us . " " And your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a terribly near miss . And as for his fists , he 's bigger than I am and I did n't fancy being thrown onto the coals on top of his letter . In his blundering way , he 's a dangerous man . Do go put your clothes on , I 'm starving for oysters . " While they waited for the elevator , he said , " What 's all this , not for a lady 's ears ? Has he been talking to you , about me ? " " No , just that I might mention to you a restaurant named Adela 's and a yellow canopy around the corner  --  to get you to join him for dinner . " Her eyes on his were interested . DEATH BY BEQUEST 87The white under-the-skin pattern appeared , but only in a brief flicker this time . The elevator stopped for them . On the way out , he went to the desk in the lobby . There were three or four people within earshot , not counting the pages whom Celia found enchanting  --  small thrush-voiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining mopheaded blond and dark haircuts , half upright and half sleepily sprawled on a bench beside the revolving doors . The fair slender girl behind the high desk was already a devoteeof Waldo 's . Not troubling to keep his voice down , Waldo said , " We 've just been subjected to a great nuisance , in our rooms . Will you take note , and pass it on to your confreres ? If a man comes into this lobby , wearing a tired-looking raincoat , and with a broken nose that could have been reset better  --  looks like a failed prizefighter , or a salesman up to his ankles in whiskey  --  will you kindly the next time , for our physical safety , immediately notify the police after you 've warned us ? And hold him here , and say we 're out but expected any minute ?

CHAPTER 11You did n't realize the degree to which you were under the control of weather , of light , until the taken-for-granted was sharply altered . It was eight-thirty . They were having breakfast and it was depthlessly dark outside , night not yet waked up . Celia caught a sudden eavesdropping reflection of themselves in the black panes . Round table by the window , with a pink linen cloth to the floor . Glisten of silver , of crystal . Waldo , up ten minutes before she woke , bad ordered tomato juice and coffee , ham and eggs and toast . He liked an ample breakfast when he was traveling .

She thrust aside the sinking sensation , the faint panic . All this nonsense because the sun rose , in Ireland , at a later hour than she was accustomed to at this time of year . All the same , she found she had suddenly decided to call Cy , in a way to remind herself who she was . If , that is , she kept her nerve and did n't change her mind . Perhaps he had changed his . Distance , time for rationalDEATH BY BEQUEST 89thought , the warm steady blaze turning out to be merely the infatuation of a few weeks , a month . She thought that in spite of his work , his gallery , his books , his friends and clients and no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loneliness about him . Which had caused him to reach out a hand to a young woman in glasses who was rejoicing in the snow and thinking about getting out her sled . Her throat ached with tears . Yes , lost .. . Not liking what was happening to the mouth of the woman looking back at her from the panes , she devoted herself to pouring each of them more coffee . Waldo did n't look lost but as usual absorbed in the moment , gracefully switched over to left-hand-fork eating . " Incredible , the eggs , " he said . " They must have been laid right outside the door ten minutes ago . . . what 's the matter , Celia , did someonestep heavily on your grave just now ? " " It 's just the dark , it gets to me ... " " I like it , " Waldo said . " Change , drama . Speaking of graves ... " An appreciative bite , chewed , swallowed . " This soda bread makes the best toast I 've ever tasted . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Startled , she gave her three-cornered smile that lit her quietface . An abrupt change of subject , but in a way a help . " Why ? I mean , just at this moment , over your new-laid eggs ? " " I dreamed our plane crashed going back , or going somewhere , and you swam to shore  --  and the less said about that the better , probably the Dublin Bay prawns . I thought at the time they had a heavy hand with the sherry . " On their marriage , Celia had insisted that they draw up brief wills to each other . A sister of her father 's had died intestate and a large estate had been chewed up in the courts before her heirs got their hands on the much reduced remainder ; the losingbattle over Aunt Cecelia 's money had become a Gore familylegend . Guilt twanged at her . Waldo asleep beside her , dreaming , drowning , dying . She swimming to shore , safe. 90 DEATH BY BEQUEST " They 're in the bottom right-hand drawer of the lacquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " your grandmother 's hymnbook . " It was one o'clock here ; it would be eight o'clock in New York . Celia , with a heavy pocketful of handsome Irish coins , walked through the rain on her way to meet Waldo for lunch at the Buttery in the Royal Hibernian , and stopped and went into a public telephone booth at the corner of St. Stephen 's Green . She felt shamed , furtive , uncertain , and thought the call probably ill-judged , after all ; it would come to nothing . People did not respond with articulate passion over their morning coffee . It came to nothing . An answering-service girl said , " Mr. Hall is in Paris until the Wednesday after Christmas , is there any message ? " No , no message . Paris somehow seemed farther away than New York . She had no way of placing him , seeing him there , as she saw him in his office with the easel in the corner and the smoke blue and amber rug on the floor , the sound of his typewriter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the drinks cart by the window . Was he doing research for his book ? Or merely shedding New York 's Santa Clauses and omnipresent canned hymns and crowding , fighting shoppers for another city , another flavor ? Her anxious mind supplied some ravishing woman . " I always spend Christmas with Amelie . . . we always go to midnight mass at Notre Dame together ... " She gave Amelie a house on the Ile St. Louis , or at least a very beautiful apartment looking out over the Seine . She had forgotten her boots in the worry about calling New York and her suede gillies were drenched and squelching . A wind , maliciousfor gentle Dublin , hit her hard from the east and tried to whirl her umbrella out of her hand . DEATH BY BEQUEST 91Cy Hall . Who was Cy Hall ?

Waldo , naturally enough , had one of the best places , in a corner , and had her martini waiting for her . " Here 's my wet hen , although you look  --  " She had drawn glances when she came in , her hair blown about , her color high from the cold and wet , something about her , a coming-and-going radiance and moodiness . As always , she was remarkably but easily well-dressed , today in a trouser suit of powdery pale brown Donegal tweed , a whirl of Hermes scarf , sapphire and ruby and cream , about her throat and one shoulder , a soaked but dashing ruddy brown suede cape . Finding Waldo 's questioning , penetrating glance disturbing , she recalled the impromptu farewell party before they left . " We 're under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Irena had been still in bed and sounded it , warm , sleepy . " Yes , I 'm all alone , " a teasing soft laugh , " so we can talk , Waldo . By the way , I hope your being in constant communication does n't mean snooping ? I wo n't have that , you know . . .

" I have to meet a man in a bar about a picture , at two-thirty . It 's amazing how much business is done in this country over whiskey . " " And in New York over gin and vermouth , " Celia said . " As long as you 're going to dump me into the wet and cold , I will go and pay my respects to the Book of Kells , although I understandI only get to see one page of it , tied back with ribbon . " In the after-lunch exodus from hotels and restaurants she could n't find a taxi , and had n't acquainted herself with the routes taken by the tall blue buses . She walked in the heavy rain to the library of Trinity College and gave the ritual silently inspecting moments to the Book of Kells on its stand , following a straggling line and hearing people saying , " But only the one page . . . ? " It was the library itself that delighted her : naved , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnbut reassuring cathedral of books . Her wet chilled feet felt very far under her and she was beginning to have a slight dreamlike feeling which had nothing to do with lunchtime martinis . Lovely idea , go back to the hotel and have a nap while Waldo did his picture-dealing , and get rid of a cold or some unlikely bug before it bit in . Waldo , a difficult and demanding patient himself , did not lightly brook other people 's illnesses . Bernard was waiting at the bar in a noisy pub on Talbot Street . To the left of him , a group of men were singing a song unfamiliar to Waldo , something about roses and donkeys , and a furious argument about football was going on on his other side . DEATH BY BEQUEST 93Bernard lifted his large whiskey and gestured at a dim corner . " We 'll want privacy . " Waldo ordered himself a forbiddingly level-headed mineral water , ignored the bartender 's gaze of astonishment , and carriedhis glass and bottle to the wooden bench , facing the loud activity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a great many hard-drinking backs . The meeting had been arranged by Bernard over the telephonewhile Celia was in the shower after breakfast . Waldo had been calm , cold . " Fifteen minutes or so , no more , if that 's what 's needed to get you off our backs . " Bernard had treated himself to a new raincoat , which he had already given a severe rumpling . " Sit down , sit down , " he cried hospitably , moving over on the cracked red leather cushion of the bench . " Lousy weather . " Waldo sat with a swift folding movement , sipped his water , and said , " What 's it about ? " " My territory , " Bernard began obliquely , " includes New Jersey , Connecticut , and lower New York although I have a few customers upstate . It 's a funny business , you 're run off your feet sometimes and then there 'll be days when the appointmentsdry up . I had some time on my hands the last few weeks , Christmas parties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranks to a halt until after they 've dried out , after New Year 's . " " And what , " Waldo said , " did you do with your time ? " " I was dropping around one noon to ask you out for a bite and a friendly chat when I saw you and that girl , that blonde , flagging down a cab . I do n't know , something about the way she looked at you and held your arm . . . anyway , just on a hunch I followed along , and then I kept it up as a kind of hobby . I mean , man , almost every day , you 've really got it made , she 's quite a . . . " He rolled his eyes upward . No sign of Waldo 's rage was visible . He took out a cigarette and flicked his lighter with a quiet hand. 94 DEATH BY BEQUEST " Lunch over at about one-fifteen , off around the corner to the yellow canopy and all tucked in until about two-fifteen , two-thirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to the same place  --  " " Are you through now ? " Waldo asked . " I 've heard your tale and I must go , I have a busy afternoon . " Bernard , red-faced with drink , eyes bulging in disbelief , gave him a lobster glare and said , " What the hell do you mean , you must go and am I through , I 've just begun . " " Finish , then , in a sentence . " " Okay , a sentence . My fair share of the old bitch 's estate . I worked my ass for it , I have every reason to expect it . Your wife as much as admits that , I 'm only asking what 's due me , anotherman would demand half . It 's not only the house , but I know for a fact that there 's valuable furniture there , a chair for instance , you 'd think it was the throne of the Pope of Rome , the prices they get for these things . All I want is "  --  rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd thought forty but let 's be reasonable . " He added to himself , okay , twenty-five , he 'd be doing nicely , even if by rights it was his property he was discussing . He felt magnanimous . " You must live in a fantasy world , " Waldo said . " If you 're blackmailing me , forget it . If it 's Celia you plan to approach with this information , forget that too . One , there 's nothing in it . And two , she 's quite comfortable with a lover of her own . " He leaned forward and went on gently , " Any way you look at it , you 're fucked dead in your tracks , Bernard . " His voice was so soft that this serene observation went unheard ; but there were a great many witnesses to what followed . Bernard 's balloon did not collapse easily . He hurled the contentsof his drink into Waldo 's face and cried , panting , " There are other ways , other ways , I warn you I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the fair thing , I might just wring your sonofabitching neck in some dark alley , how would you like that  --  or hers .

Even for a tolerant Irish pub , this was too much . A short , heavily muscled man who had been drinking stout and idly watching a few feet away from them tore Bernard 's hands away with surprising strength . " I 'm off duty , " he said pleasantly , " but would you like to charge the fellow ? " Waldo got to his feet , wiping his face with his handkerchief and then rubbing the back of his hand across his throat . He now had fascinated listeners . With a fine throwaway style that drew the approval of his audience , he said : " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , clear carrying voice  --  " threatened to kill me or my wife or for all I know both of us . He made as you saw a start on the project here , but I would n't say it was quite the place for a successful murder . No , drop it , he 's a distant relative and we 'll charitably say it was only the drink . Or let 's hope so . Speaking of drinks , officer , a large whiskey for you and thank you very much . And with my fingers crossed that there 'll be another one of you around next time we have a family meeting . " To the general approbation of the pub  --  " all combed and brushed and curried , the fellow , but a cool customer , a tough little chap underneath it all "  --  he paid for the policeman 's drink at the bar . Then he walked composedly to the pegs by the door , collected his raincoat and umbrella , and went out without so much as a look over his shoulder at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to order another whiskey and about to be summarily refused it . CHAPTER 12Through an increasing haze in her head , Celia walked a block from Trinity College , hesitated , then hailed a cab . Things to do , presents to buy , but not right now . Later . Ridiculous . . . you ca n't catch a cold a few hours after gettingyour feet wet in the rain ; it has to settle in and incubate . Perhaps that enormous man on the plane , elbow in her lap , sleeping almost on her shoulder , had passed it along to her as a fringe benefit of his company , and the Dublin weather had merely served to bring the germ into bloom . In any case , there was nothing to do but deal with it directly , get rid of it , before Waldo began by looking patient and martyredand then started scolding . It was an added weariness to see the packages someone had neatly stacked on the writing desk in the sitting room . Christmasbounty mailed to them . She had dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always those people who gave you a first-time unexpected gift and sent you into a minor panic . Of course , there could n't be  --  yes , there was . She recognized the firm crisp printing and the return address in the corner and held the package in her hands a few moments before she opened it . A copy of Pride and Prejudice , one of her cherished books , read ritually every three years , although she could n't remember telling him about that . Bound in silk-soft emeld green calf , a slim light volume , pages brilliantly edged in geld , end papers marbled in peacock colors , and in his hand on the flyleaf , " Celia from Cy . " DEATH BY BEQUEST 97Nothing else . What else could he write in a book that other hands might pick up and leaf through ? Of course , he would have had to send something to Waldo too , and there it was , looking in its wrappings very much like another book . A book makes a nice impersonal present . She soaked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed with Pride and Prejudice . The haze thickened . The tulips on the curtains floated , came near , receded . Rain swept the windows , making a rushing music . Book open , under her hand , she went off into a heavy sleep . Waldo found her still sleeping when he came in after four . He went over the the bed and stood looking down at her , hands hanging quietly at his side . The helplessness of sleep , the mystery of it , she could be in China or back at the age of three , or with Cy Hall , wandering in some delightful place .. He saw the book under her hand , gently extracted it , read the inscription , riffled lightly through the petal-thin pages , turned it upside down and gave it a little shake ; and then replaced it on the bed , near her hand . The slight motion , the presence over her woke her and she looked up into his face as if wondering who he was and then shot upright . " You scared me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Expecting someone else ? " Dry amused voice . " And me playingSanta Claus for you  --  " She saw the heap of packages he had dumped on his bed , littleones , large ones . Oh God , she 'd lost a day somewhere , tomorrowwas his birthday , she 'd almost forgotten the landmark birthday , and the day after was Christmas Eve ; she had no idea of the business hours of Dublin shops on Christmas Eve . Early closing , maybe . And there was only one present for the two celebrations so far , the hacking jacket . She told herself that the sleep had done her a great deal of good . Time to get down to business . Was n't there a theory98 DEATH BY BEQUESTthat people contract colds because they refuse to cope ? She seized on the encouraging demanding little word . Cope . He looked thoughtfully at her as she got out of bed . " You 're appealingly pink  --  you 're not getting a cold ? " " A little one , I put it to bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slightly hoarse . " Then you 're not up to Canavan House this evening ? " " Canavan House ? " " A tea and sherry reception we 've been invited to , very grand , he 's in Parliament  --  the Dail I suppose  --  and she collectsyoung artists , Mrs. D. gave me a note to her . " " No , I do n't want to go around possibly infecting hundreds , and I have things to buy  --  " She gave another look at the pile on his bed . There must be a dozen presents , and they must be all for her . " I 'll order up some hot tea . That and a couple of my cold tablets should put you back on your feet . " Waiting for their tea , he changed his wet clothes and put on a severely handsome black suit , white shirt , dark glowing amber tie . Taking her cold pills obediently , with a hope they would n't quarrel with the aspirin , she said , " You look a little strange yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Do n't be surprised if I arrive home late and tipsy , I 'll be having the last fling of my thirties . What exactly are your plans ? " " I 'll have tea and dress and then go out , the stores are open late at least tonight . And I am sorry , Waldo , I should be going with you but I 've got to catch up with myself and time is running out . " Staring at her , he said , " It 's only a birthday after all and Christmas , not the apocalypse . Do n't overdo it if you 're feeling rocky . " He , not she , was the one who needed sympathy and a lift ofDEATH BY BEQUEST 99morale now . " I 'm feeling fine . " A little giddy and unreal , and hot . Surely not a fever . Cope . Tea arrived ; Waldo downed a quick cup and put on his black trenchcoat , which he referred to as my villainous one as against the oyster-white Burberry . The desk called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. St. Clair forgot to leave you the address and tele- phone number of Canavan House where he 's off to , have you a pencil handy ? " When she went out the rain had thinned , but this time she was booted and prepared , warm and dry inside her yellow coat . The feeling of unreality persisted . The eyes of shop assistants looked overlarge but their voices were curiously remote and far away . If only there were n't so many people , normally polite people , now hurrying , pushing . On Nassau Street , she bought Waldo two handkerchief linen shirts , one pale tangerine and one lilac , and three wool ties in interesting plaids . A beginning , but there was that awful heap of his to meet , to match . Might as well face Grafton Street , where the big stores and the big crowds were . Umbrellas tangled with umbrellas ; you had to pick your way step by step along the sidewalk . Gloves there , to her left . She bought a pair , of heavy cable-crocheted creamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . Someone jolted his tray and he howled imprecations as oranges rolled , hands gleefully snatched . Celia tripped on an orange and al- most fell . Buses towering and lurching by , so close , cars weaving , no rhyme or reason to the traffic flow , and in the shifting flare of light people darting every which way across the street , did n't they care whether they lived or died ? Perhaps in this Catholic republic the next world was more appealing . And the noise , the horns , the cries echoing through her head , a cluster of shabby children with tambourines singing " Adeste Fideles , " a man deep in drink shouting , " Down with the10o DEATH BY BEQUESTPope ! " Another cry , " Shame on you , shame ! " as the female admonisher'sshopping bag was thwacked hard against his knees . Jeaned boys , a group of them , with long soaked hair , playing some kind of game , chasing each other down the street , cutting through people like cars through traffic ; a shoulder hit hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birthday presents and Christmas presents , you 've only begun . Press on , Celia . Silver cufflinks , shaped and studded like starfish . A slender little gold-plated clothespin to clip to a tie . He could use another cigarette case ; she bought one in tobacco brown morocco . Turning to leave the shop , she hesitated inside its glass door , looking out at the rain , the river of umbrellaed bodies . Another hour or less ought to do it , spend a little more time and pile up some more packages on this madhouse thoroughfareand then retreat to the relative quiet of Dawson Street for books and records . She forced herself out into the stream . It seemed , in this peculiarevening , not at all unnatural that the red-headed tinker woman should come face to face with her under a streetlight , her child still slung damply over her hip . This time she too had an umbrella . She made a fierce near-swipe with it at Celia . " You . I see you have n't broken your leg yet , but give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse off you now  --  " " Be off , Belinda , leave the lady alone , " a man said behind her , clapping a hand on the ragged shoulder . " And mind where you spit ! " She must be known , in Dublin . Waldo said it was a parochial town , and that if you sneezed in the Four Courts they 'd bless you in Merrion Square . The encounter lent an edge of doom to the darkness . She had a momentary impulse to burst into tears . I feel so awful , and here 's this woman spitting at me , and I must get across the street somehow  --  yes , thank God , a traffic light . She waited dizzily at the curb for the light to change . TheDEATH BY BEQUEST 101motion , the pressure behind her was frightening , people three or four deep like a great wave impatient to break . A bus passed a foot from her nose and knocked her umbrella back . Someone shrieked , " You 'll have my eye out ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and the savage push forward . The light had n't changed . Not fifteen yards away there were the great white blinding eyes of a movingbus . In a period of split seconds impossibly slowed , eternal , she felt herself toppling forward , thought she heard herself screaming , or was it someone else . Before the mind , in the face of the unfaceable , turned itself off , she found herself thinking among a dozen other long , long thoughts , I 've caught my death , I 've caught my death . And , My presentsCy , oh Cy . It hit her , death , it must be , a great midair springing , a hurtling , face to face , but a body , what a strange feeling , bones , flesh , impact , cruel , hurting , where were the headlights , the steel , the screaming rubber , the tearing horns  --  ? " God have mercy on us , the creature 's dead . " " Drunk , was she , I saw her swaying , like  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lashes moving , so ? " " For God 's sake get a policeman . " " And her pretty packages all scattered , here , this one , and this one  --  " " The great gossoon , dashing over here against the light , he slammed right into her , he trying to get out from under the bus wheels before they hit him . . . and just picked himself up and off with him , never stopped to see what he 'd done . . . " " Well , in a way , lucky for her , d' you think she was wanting to do away with herself ? Jumping forward like that , the bus com-ing  --  " Celia heard portions of it in a half faint , not quite believing she was alive , not quite ready to acknowledge the impossible and beautiful , the miraculous . Extinction one second , and in the next her head against the102 DEATH BY BEQUESTwet cold pavement , a great stunned cloudiness , and voices pokinginto the cloud from high above . Rain , feelable rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches from her eyes tickled her cheek . Moons of bending faces , helpful hands reaching down to her . A fat man knelt and put an arm under her shoulders . " Stand back , what 's all this ? " A young policeman lifted her to her feet and was bombarded with a dozen theories . He shook his head impatiently as if disposing of gnats . These people , paying no attention whatever to the lights , taking their lives into their hands ; he gathered that the good God had sent her another such a damned fool as herself flying from the opposite side of the street , just in the nick of time . He felt her begin to shake . She reached for her eyes and said , " My glasses  --  " " Here , miss , thanks to the Holy Mother they were n't stepped on , and I 've gathered up your packages , a bit wet and muddy but  --  " Celia could have wept at the kindness of the dumpy woman with the purple birthmarked forehead . Her intelligence was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Will you be wanting a doctor ? Have you cut yourself or hurt your head ? " the policeman asked , still supporting her firmly . " No , just the shock  --  the scare and the fall , " her own voice almost unrecognizable to her . " If I could get a cab to the Shelbourne  --  " Her knees buckled and he tightened his hold . " I do n't think your legs are up to getting you home alone any way at all , " he said . " Here , take a step . And another . That 's a good girl . Blossom by blossom the spring begins . " What a delightful policeman to find , in a world magically given back to her . " Cab there ! In we go , the two of us . The Shelbourne , and mind your driving , this lady 's had enough of fair Dublin 's traffic . " DEATH BY BEQUEST 103Cy I-Iall had called from Dublin Airport . The St. Claus ' room did n't answer . He went through Customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . His driver , who was loquacious , gestured at the American Consulate as they passed it . " We call it the Crown of Thorns . The architecture , you 'll understand , not the intent . And are you familiar with the bird market , sir ? Poor souls in cages , it 'd make you bleed to see them bottled up . Now the canal here was once a thriving waterway . . . " The lobby of the Shelbourne was festive . Well-dressed peoplehurried in and out to pleasure , a holiday kind of expectancy in their faces . Christmas decorations sparkled discreetly . From the left , from the right , came the delightful lark notes of the page boys , " Mis-tah Crevass , Mis-tah Crevass . . . Mis-tah Schmidt , Mis-tah Schmidt , " the name Schmidt taking on a high unlikely music . Thinking that at any minute he might see Celia , he felt a littleas he had at the age of three when he had first gazed upon , with full comprehension , the Christmas tree in the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her candles all lit for him . The girl at the desk said , " Their room does n't answer ? Perhapsthey 're napping , but I have the impression they have n't come back yet , I believe they went out separately .

He cast an eye at the bar but resisted its lure ; he might miss her  --  What impossible good luck , their having gone their separate ways when leaving the hotel , if she came in alone . He stood near the door , willing her to him out of the dark outside . When she came , she was not alone , but accompanied by a policeman and immediately the object of fascinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty , hair tossed , an air of emotional dishevelment  --  he thought for a wild moment that she was unaccountably and thoroughly drunk . She saw him and before she could stop herself cried out his name on a long piercing gasp . CHAPTER 13 " Mr. St. Clair ? " the policeman asked . " No  --  Celia , what 's happened  --  ? " " This lady had a close shave , just missed a bad street accident , so I though I 'd see her safe back to home and mother as it were . " The policeman was puzzled ; like most people , he was susceptible to love , and he felt in the air about him a heat and a startling sweetness . " If you 're a friend then , I 'll give her into your keeping , I 've got to get back . " Celia tried brokenly to thank him ; he waved it off and said over his shoulder as he left them , " A life saved is a fine present to everybody .

" It was in her pocket . She handed it to him and fumbled for paper tissues in her handbag as her nose began to run . What a vision she must be , to him . Aftershock licked nearer , hysteria threatened , but the arm around her in the elevator and then in the long Persian-carpeted corridor clasped her so tightly it almosthurt . She concentrated on the arm . Cy 's arm , appearing from nowhere in the middle of darkness , disaster . Inside the door , he flicked on lights . She saw herself with horror in a mirror and ran a hand over her tumbled hair . Dirt on her cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to  --  " lob DEATH BY BEQUEST " Go ahead . I 'll order brandy .

He waited in the sitting room for a very long five minutes . She came back washed , brushed , and desperately pale . " Drink first . Explanations later . " He handed her the little balloon glass of brandy and touched his frosty martini to its edge . " Try to get it all down and then I 'll give you a refill . " The brandy was searing and steadying . " I do n't understand , first the nightmare and then the fairy tale , " she said , color beginning to come back to her face . " Where did you come from , Cy ? I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right there , just when I . . . " " We 'll get to that . What about the near accident ?

" Someone tried to kill me . " It was said not to him but to the air around her , her voice distant , stunned . " Celia darling . . . you 've been pushed and shoved in crowds before at God knows how many New York street corners  --  " " In the small of my back , something , maybe the tip of an umbrella or the edge of an attache case , or a man 's or a woman 's cane . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my suit jacket underneath . . . but it did n't feel accidental , it felt directed , it felt , what 's the word , personal , and viciousThe endless seconds of terror as she fell forward caught her up again ; she gripped her hands tightly together , against herDEATH BY BEQUEST 107breasts , looking back at the seconds , looking back at the topplingbody , doomed. .. and then some madman tried to make it against the light from the other side of the street and slammed straight into me and knocked me fiat on the sidewalk , and . . . saved my life . . .

Oh hello , Waldo , just catching up with the Times while Celia gets her clothes on  --  A man deep in his newspaper wears a certain air of innocent detachment . They went down to the grill ; found a corner booth , and had dinner , which took rather a long time as Celia had trouble at first getting it down . On command , she went carefully through a cup of consomme , a cheese omelet , a roll and butter , and a small dish of vanilla ice cream . Cy hungrily but absent-mindedlyate steak and duchess potatoes and an anchovy and asparagus salad washed down with Guinness . DEATH BY BEQUEST 109He held out the glass to her . " Take a sip of this .

" Just making sure , once again , it 's really you , and you 're really here , I 'm not havinga dream with my head on the sidewalk  --  " He took the doubting hand in both of his . " ... When I was told you were in Paris , I had you all fixed up with a girl named Amelie whom you always spend your Christmases with ... " " My Christmases in future , " he said , " will always be spent with a girl named Celia . As well as the rest of my year . I hope by now we understand each other ? " His eyes were near and steady , demanding an answer . Her eyes , lost in his , said it before she spoke . " Yes , Cy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of a key , the door opened . " Well , good evening , " Waldo said . " Pleasant surprise , Cy . " " Waldo- " His head was heavily , dramatically bandaged . Blood stained his shirt collar . He walked slowly to the vacated sofa and collapsed on it and said , " Who will be the first to pour a brandy for the walking wounded ? " CHAPTER 14Bernard waited in the rain outside Canavan House with what was , for him , patience . Striding the block from end to end , but keeping close to the house walls so he could n't be spotted from a window ; lighting one cigarette from the end of another ; and cursing to himself at the rain and the chill . When he had called the Shelbourne , asking for Mr. St. Clair , the girl said in a holding-back way , " You are n't Mr. Caldwell by any chance ? " Slippery little bastard , thinking it was as simple as that , that he was a fly to be swatted away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moran . " He got the address . An umbrella would have been hampering but he wished he had one . He thought with longing of the cosy place on BanquetStreet . Slummy-looking alley but nice setup she had , fireplaceand all . He had had a semi-sobering huge tea there , his toast browned for him on a fork held out to the fire . They had met at a pub near his hotel the night before , fallen into the conversation of the lonely , taken immediately to each other and at closing time parted fast friends . " Next time , " Bernardsaid , " I wo n't let you go home alone , that I promise you . " She was a big , tall woman , pink and white , heavy-breasted , with thick dark hair worn the way his mother had worn hers , in a great loose Psyche knot which she absent-mindedly kept pattingand pinning at just as his mother had done . Her blue eyes were large , kind , and gullible . She was a masseuse , she told him , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly in earnest . " Lovely job , hard work in its way but my time 's my own , I come and go as I112 DEATH BY BEQUESTlike , only women of course , dear , the men in this country are shy ... " Bernard assured her that he would n't be shy . At teatime , he went over his grievances again with her , bathinghimself in her ready sympathy. is. . . burned up my letter , had the gall to laugh in my face when I brought up the matter of his girlfriend ... " " A grand big fellow like you does n't have to take lip from anybody , " Doreen McGrath said . " Have another cream cake , do . " As she got the story , they were holding back money they owed him , a great deal of money , from property left to him and the cousin . She herself was a member of a large contentiousfamily and not only believed him implicitly but was wholly on his side . Going off to sleep after parting with him last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loneliness was over , somewhere in the future a ring , and the title Mrs. to gloat over . And the States , she 'd always wanted to go to the States . A bit beforehand , perhaps , but they 'd gotten on beautifully from the first hesitant hello .. . " ... not only the house itself on one of the best streets in Philadelphia , but several pieces of valuable furniture , and a pile of jewelry , diamonds , and so on ... and just the other day I remembered my mother talking about a collection of antique silver she had in a comer cabinet in the dining room , but all I ever saw was old yellow newspaper inside the panes ... " Her womanly attention to his comfort , her warm blue gaze , gave him a heady feeling of capability , of strength . " What the fellow wants is a show of force , a touch of the fist to give him an idea who he 's dealing with , " he said through his cream cake . " He 's half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business with your tongue and that 's all there is to it . " Canavan House was number thirteen . Correctly numbered all right , Bernard said to himself . Some kind of pale stone , big place , purple door at the top of a wide shallow flight of slate steps , great tall windows , filmy lacy stuff and what looked like red velvet , a starry chandelier , moving heads and shoulders . DEATH BY BEQUEST 113Waldo probably warming himself , glass in hand , at some roaringfire while his cousin-in-law waited in the rain .. . Waldo sauntering out of the pub this afternoon , leaving him crouched and momentarily beaten because of the bloody policemanat his elbow , Waldo looking as if he owned the world . With my fingers crossed , officer , that there 'll be another of you around the next time we have a family meeting . Well , there was no one to speak of around , police or otherwise . The crowds , the stores , were blocks away . This was the time , on this kind of street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe , and rich . Waldo was a little drunk when he left Canavan House , but erect and graceful about it . He walked south on Merrion Street and turned in at a comer gate to St. Stephen 's Green . Passing close to the immense bulk and towering gloom of a yew tree , he was seized from behind in an iron grip . A large hand clapped itself over his mouth and jaw . " I meant it , you know , about the dark alley , " Bernard said , breath hot on Waldo 's skin , voice low and whiskied . " You wo n't listen to reason , you wo n't listen to right and justice , maybe you 'll listen to force . Do n't move or try to call out , I have the point of my knife at the back of your neck "  --  a delicateproving prick at the nape  --  " but I 'm not going to kill you . Yet . I will , though , unless you come through , and fast , and you 'll never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Footsteps neared . Dark as it was , Bernard pulled Waldo to the far side of the yew tree . His prey was very still , the tiny cold knifepoint reminding him to be so ; animal-quiet , braced . " I 'll be in touch with you tomorrow sometime , you 'll be back in business by then , but just to let you know I 'm a man of my word , and not to be pushed around and laughed away  --  " Waldo , suddenly released and beginning to turn , got a stunningblow behind the ear and crashed forward against the tree bole , hung there for a moment , and fell sprawling to the grass . A boy and a girl , the tree their trysting place rain or shine , day or night , found him there unconscious a few minutes later. 114 DEATH BY BEQUEST " Drunk is it ? " the boy said . " He 's cut his head , look at the blood will you . A robbery maybe "  --  he searched and found the American word  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his girl to run to the far comer and bring a policeman . " And hurry , He looks bad , I 'll just take a handkerchief to the blood . " Waldo whirled brandy in his glass . " Fortunately , there was a doctor around the corner , he got me X-rayed and stitched up , only a flesh wound where I hit the tree . Your cousin knows exactly the spot , behind the ear , to go for , he was very artistic about it . " He was telling his tale with a certain relish , as though it had happened to someone else . Taken aback at his manner , Celia explained to herself that he was still lightheaded , probably , and perhaps a little drunk after the Canavan House festivities ; and then , he responded to drama in any form . While she listened to him , a voice in another part of her mind asked , had he heard them before he came in ? All my Christmases ... Yes , Cy , oh yes .. . He gave no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your aplomb , Waldo , " Cy said crisply . " Anyone would think you got knocked on the head as a regular thing , you take it so well in stride . " He was standing in front of the fire , his face intent and sharply worried . " What the hell are you going to do about this madman ? Suppose he goes after Celia next ? Of course you brought the police up to date on him ? " " I was in no shape , my knees giving under me , to go and make a formal charge at a police station , and answer four hundred and three plodding questions . In any case the doctor ordered me home and to bed . I gave my policeman Bernard 's name and description , told him I did n't know what hotel he 's staying in but it 's somewhere off O'Connell Street . The trouble is , there were no witnesses and I think he detected a strong recollection of John Jameson on my breath . Besides , family fists used against each other are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 're not taking it in stride after all , you sound slightly deranged yourself , " Cy said . " Giving the matter the back of your hand  --  Celia had a rough evening too . She thought someone tried to push her under a bus on Grafton Street . I thought she was crazy . Now I 'm not so sure . " Waldo raised a hand to his bandaged head . He looked , for all his jauntiness , on a dangerous brink , bones etched sharply against the pallor of his face ; his hand shook . " A bus- ' " We 've had enough honors , " Celia said . " I 'm here , I 'm safe , and I 'm not sure any more , not sure of anything  --  " At her rising voice Cy , before he could stop himself , put a steadying hand on her shoulder . " Poor Cy , two battered St. Clairs to comfort all in the one night , " Waldo said . " By the way , have you come three thousandmiles because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great courtesy . " His smile had a faintly Cheshire cat look . " I 'm more or less on business , as you are . Happy birthday anyway . To get back to your cousin  --  " " Not mine . Celia 's , thank God . Well , I 'll hasten to try and reassure you , I 've got to get this head on its pillow . With luck the police will call around the hotels tonight , try to track him down , see if there really is a Bernard Caldwell and I have n't inventedhim out of the mists of alcohol . If they find out where he 's staying , I will go and see him tomorrow morning  --  accompanied by a police escort  --  and have what I plan to be a final interview with him . " " You do n't think , " Cy said slowly , " you could give in to nice comfortable cowardice  --  for both of you  --  and take Celia home ? No point in Caldwell 's staying here after you leave . He has a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can be got at and taken care of by suitable authorities if he tries anything else . " Waldo yawned . " We 'll see how my interview goes . And if you do n't mind my saying so , I think you should take yourself home , I 've had it and Celia looks as if she has too . If you have116 DEATH BY BEQUESTanother home , that is . Maybe you 're in the next room here for all I know . " " The Gresham , " Cy said , picking up his raincoat . " I 'll call you in the morning , Waldo , before I leave , to see what you 've arranged . I 'm concerned even if you 're not . " " Yes , daddy , " Waldo said . " It 's a great relief to have someonebandying orders about and seeing to our safety , Celia 's and mine . " Doreen had a great fragrant lamb stew all but ready for him . She was industriously skimming the fat from its surface when he came in , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a domestic kiss and sniffed the stew with great pleasure . " Out cold , " he said , " in that Stephen 's Park , or whatever it is . No permanent harm , maybe a stiff neck tomorrow . " She gave him a look of admiration mixed with apprehension . She had vivid recollections of a family lawsuit concerning the ownership of a bull , the verdict followed by near-broken heads , and policemen . " You do n't think he might charge you ? You would n't want the police after you , they might cramp your style . " " I was thinking about that on the way back  --  uh  --  home , here . " He put an arm around her waist and hugged her to him . " I thought I might change hotels and give a fake name but that wo n't work , have to show your passport ... " Shyly she said , " Not to put myself forward , I can give you shelter for a night or two , and then , I have a cousin runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , she would n't give a damn about names or passports . " She was rewarded with a hearty kiss . " You 're a pal , Doreen . It 's not that I 'm afraid of anything the little bastard could do to get back at me , but I want to get on with my arrangements . Let 's have a drink before your stew . " She poured whiskey for the two of them . " And you really think he 'll be knocked back to his senses now , let you have what 's by rights coming to you ? " DEATH BY BEQUEST 117 " I think there 's a good chance , nothing like letting a man know you have to be dealt with , not shoved aside . And by the way , there 's someone in your chair who might cash in a little too . " Warmed with whiskey , the smell of stew , the partisanshipof Doreen and the remembered releasing pleasure of his fist against bone , he felt generous and triumphant . " I 'll give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with him and Celia . And if he is n't ready , then , to cooperate "  --  he took a large thirsty gulp of his drink  --  " I 'll play my ace . " CHAPTER 15 " Happy birthday , Waldo . " She gave him , recklessly and guiltily , everything she had bought for his birthday and for Christmas . At six o'clock , she had gotten out tissue paper , fawn , brown , and cream , and spools of yellow and white satin ribbon , and wrapped his packages . He was responsible for her early waking . She had been curled into the small sofa in the sitting room , under a pink blanket . Inching out of a bad dream , she was aware of lamplight , a face near , curiously dark under something strange and white , a pierce of eyes into her own . There was a clap of terror at her heart and then the darkness and the whiteness became Waldo , bandaged , yes , struck in the head , beaten about while she sat in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing out here ? " he demanded softly . " I started sneezing some time in the night ... I thought I 'd wake you and that you badly needed your sleep  --  " She wondered how long he had been sitting on the arm of the sofa , watching her . " Get back to bed , Waldo . How 's your head ? " " Too many things going around in it , " Waldo said , his gaze still deep in hers . " But birthdays are n't the time to talk about walls falling down on you . " Certainties wavered ; the unreality which had started in the Aer Lingus plane caught her up again . She backed mentally away from it : Cy and the implicit promise she had made him . Divorce . Here in the black night-morning , it seemed an impossible , DEATH BY BEQUEST 119mad scheme . With Waldo hurting physically and psychologically , ticking off the new number , forty , to himself , and talkingof walls falling . Before they had gone to sleep last night , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening . At the end , he said , " It sounds too wild to be true , it was probably an accident , a coincidence , but seeing what a nut case Bernard is  --  Think back , Celia . You have an uncanny sense of smell . He reeks of tobacco , whiskey , and some kind of awful musk scent he must use by the bucket . He 'd have been an arm 's or umbrella 's length behind you  --  " She instinctively sniffed a little of the bedroom 's warm safe air . " You 'd make a good detective , Waldo ... no , all I get is a trampled-on orange and wet wool . And sweat , unidentifiable as male or female . " Turning her head on the pillow , she had added after a moment'shesitation , " You do n't think it would be wiser to give in , get rid of him ? I do n't know how much more either of us can take of this kind of thing . " Waldo snapped off the light . " Now you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five thousand dol-lars . " Unanswerable , of course . He was opening his presents between bites of breakfast when the phone rang . He said , " Dracula , probably  --  I 'll get it . " It was n't Bernard , but a polite cheerful police voice . " We found your bird , sir , or rather his nest but unfortunately he 's flown away from it . He was staying at the Saint Basil , a rundownclass of place on Cavendish Street . He checked out last evening at nine or a little later . So that 's that . Is all quiet ? Have you had any more trouble with your  --  er  --  relative ? " " No , but there 's a possibility he tried to push my wife under a bus before he got around to me , one of your men very kindly saw her back to the hotel , there may be a report on it . " After a startled pause , the voice said tolerantly , " All 's well120 DEATH BY BEQUESTthat ends well  --  Merry Christmas to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there are any more developments . " " Maddening , " Waldo said to Celia . He sat down and opened another package . " Oh , what nice gloves , " immediately trying them on . " Under the circumstances it was obliging of them to look for him at all . I suppose it 's because we 're visitors , Americans . Family quarrels in the streets of Dublin . Domestic disturbances . Their daily bread . " " Maybe he 's given up and gone home . Money running out  --  " " I heartily pray you 're right , " Waldo said , and , " I really have you trained in the matter of ties , these are terrific . " He was in his bath when the phone rang again . Oh Cy darling , what am I going to say to you ? A woman 's voice , lightly accented , identified itself as that of Irena Tova . " Mrs. St. Clair ? I 'm terribly sorry to bother you at this hour but something 's come up at the gallery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . I wanted to catch him before you went out . " Almost ten o'clock here , Celia though , almost five o'clock in New York . Conscientious of Irena Tova , very . She put her head in at the bathroom door . " New York for you . Irena . " Toweled and dripping , soap froth lacy on his sleek olive back , Waldo went to the telephone by the bed . She took the Irish Times off her own bed and went into the sitting room , trying to make the tactful retreat a casual matter . He made no attempt to keep his voice down . " Good morning , Irena Katrina . . . well , thanks , but it 's officially my very last birthday . . . " A long silence , and then , " About the Stella , things being the way they are , I 'd be inclined to say go ahead , but see if you can pull him up five thousand higher , say you have another offer and you 'll need twenty-four hours to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same , here .. . Goodbye ... " Busy splashing sounds from the tub , and after a little while he came out dressed , glistening . DEATH BY BEQUEST 121 " Did you hear me step on my own grave , telling Irena it was my last birthday ? " he asked , giving her a face-reading look . " Yes , but I know what you mean . . . shall I order up more coffee for us ? " " You ca n't wash away ripe age with coffee , but . . . on the other hand I think I might manage a glass of champagne . Just as a way of saying the hell with it . " Or just as a way of celebrating a birthday call from Irena . They were sitting on the little sofa sharing the champagne , Celia trying for gaiety , when the telephone burring at his elbow caught Waldo in mid-swallow . It was Bernard . Celia heard , from several feet away , almost every word of the incredible conversation . Polite , mildly concerned voice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Fine , thank you . " Waldo sounding at his most dangerous , soft and icy . " Where are you calling from , by the way ? The police would be interested . " " Like they say , that 's for me to , know and you to find out . But to get down to business , are you ready to have a little talk , you and Celia , get this thing wrapped up , over and done with ? " " Once and for all , you can take your murderous blackmail and shove it , " Waldo said . " The answer is no . No . And in case you did n't hear me correctly . . . no . " " Oh well , too bad . I hoped I would n't have to go through with it , it 's my property as well as yours , my loss as well as yours . " " Meaning what ? " " I thought you might see reason , I thought Celia might be able to persuade you , nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenth chance . " Casually , " And how did you go about that ? " " I have some friends in South Philly who I suppose you would n't call exactly respectable . It 's all arranged that if and when they get the word from me over Ma Bell "  --  a brief relishing pause  --  " Miss Laura Gore 's residence will be burned to the ground . They 're good at it . " 122 DEATH BY BEQUESTCelia , worried about Waldo 's color  --  how could olive skin go mauve ?  --  took his free hand in hers . It was cold and damp . " Too bad all the old soul 's goodies , that furniture , and the diamonds and rubies and things , have to be kissed goodbye along with the rest of the house , but there you are . And do n't rub your hands over the insurance , she always raised hell over the premiums and got her coverage lowered , I remember the year before last she 'd cut it to twenty-five thousand . To tell you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the house , and everything in it , after she 'd breathed her last . But too bad to see it all go roaring up in flames . . . when you think about it . " Quietly and delicately , in someone else 's voice , Waldo said , " Your point is well taken . " There was something about his face , momentarily beaten , destroyed , that Celia wanted to look away from . But why ?  --  about a mere , now cumbersome possession , a contest with an unprincipled lout ? She held his champagne glass to him and aware of her eyes on his face he smiled a little and said into the telephone , " PerhapsI 'm ready after all to have a little talk . I have some things to attend to  --  suppose you call back here at around four and we 'll fix a place to meet . You 'd hardly want to join us in our room because I might have the police waiting for you . " Bernard 's voice was vastly pleased , and his words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good boy . That 's my Waldo . " Waldo replaced the receiver so carefully that it frightened her a little . " But what nonsense  --  surely it 's just saber-rattling ? " she said . " And if he 's to be taken seriously , all you 'd need would be a call to the Philadelphia fire department  --  or police  --  or both ? " " You have a touching faith in our guardians . Christmastime in a big city , the usual carnival of fires from tenement Christmastrees added to the everyday score . " He drained his champagne glass and refilled it . " Commissioner , would you mind having your men keep a twenty-fourhourwatch on my house on Pine Street ? My wife 's cousin threatens to have some friends of his burn it down . And whereDEATH BY BEQUEST 123are you calling from , Mr. St. Clair , about this house ? Dublin . Are you a Philadelphia resident ? No , New York . Why do n't you come here and protect your own property if you really believe  --  No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to burn it down from Ireland , by telephone . " Waldo lit a cigarette . " And then we pause for a snort of laughter from the other end of the line . " " Then what exactly are we going to do now , about him ? " " A check wo n't work , he 'll know we can put a stop on it , even if we could get our hands on any rich round sum immediately . I think "  --  he got up and went to the window , hands in his pockets  --  " maybe your idea is the best and the simplest . Let him have the house to sell and give him a commission , a little over and above what you 'd pay an ordinary real estate outfit . With a written and witnessed agreement from him that this concludes the matter of his interest in the Gore house . " " But would a piece of paper stop him from pestering us all our lives ? He got away with it once , why not a second time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate fire , excuse the expression , we have to put out , " Waldo said . " We 'll worry about the rest of it later . As Cy said , he 'll be much easier to deal with at home , where he can be got at . " " Shall I come with you ? After all , I 'm the one who stuck you with him , and the house . " " No . Being Bernard , if he took my proposal amiss he might try to brain you with a beer mug or go for your throat the way he went for mine , with a little under fifty witnesses present " He looked at his watch . " I 'm due shortly at the doctor 's to have my head checked . It 's a good thing he ca n't see inside it . " She got up to get dressed to go with him . " No , do n't , Celia . You 'd better stay here for a bit , in case our friendly neighborhood bird dog calls  --  Cy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already entombed somewhere . After the doctor , I have a talented madwoman in Killeney , to see her Hibernian Hepworths , and then a stop at Leixlip , will you be all right ? " 124 DEATH BY BEQUESTOnly half-hearing , she said in the astonishment of returning to the ordinary , and the inescapable , " I have , God help me , shopping to doHe had n't been gone five minutes before Cy called . " Good morning , Celia darling . I want very much to see you but insane as it sounds when I 'm planning to take you away from him with all possible speed , I did n't like to walk in on Waldo 's birthday rites . " " But I thought you were leaving this morning , for Aberdeen . " Deliberately vague , he said , " There 's been a hitch , it may be another day or so  --  " and sharply urgent , " What about Cald-well ? " She told him what about Caldwell . He said in a puzzled way , " I suppose he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel , I can only hope he 's not going to spring another trap . " " He sounded , " she said , surprised now at the recollection , " at first shattered , and as though he would faint , if men can , that is  --  " " Shattered ? The imperturbable Waldo ? I 've seen colossal sales slip through his hands , no fault of his , and he never bats an eyelash . What is this house anyway , the Taj Mahal of Pine Street ? " " No , only a big dark shabby brick house with a dirty front door and a broken shutter . " Shattered . Worrying the word like a bone , he asked on impulse , " What was her name , this aunt of yours ? " " The same as mine . Gore . " " Gore , " he said prodding to himself . " Philadelphia .. . Gore . . . " " Well , in any case , a few minutes later , after the call , he seemed calm , cool  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all I know that could be the effect of shock , the head wound  --  " Cy was n't entirely sure why he had deferred by telephone his meeting with a hard-up Scottish peer to discuss the purchase of his Reynolds . DEATH BY BEQUEST 125A stitched and bandaged Waldo , a possibly imagined lethal attack on Celia , and Waldo 's peculiarly blithe handling of these matters  --  " I will go and see him tomorrow and have what I hope will be a final interview " . . . How did you have a decisive final interview with a walking , churning , unpredictable rage ? He remembered the violence in the gallery , the painting kicked brutally off the wall . " And if you think this is the end of it , it 's just the beginning , Mr. Waldo your honor St. Clair . " He felt no reassuring certainty that , in her husband 's care , bleak danger hovering , Celia could be considered safe . CHAPTER 16 " What , speaking of the house , did you mean by all those jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I connectedher somehow with paper napkins and canned milk . " Waldo was drinking whiskey with his attacker of the night before . McGettigan 's , shabby , dim , its air a stale haze of malt and tobacco , was in an alley off Sean McDermott Street near the canal . It was half a block away from Doreen 's Banquet Street flat . When Waldo , during the telephone arrangements about a meeting place said , " It sounds like a dump , " Bernard answered , " It happens to be convenient for me . I 'm making the rules now , remember ? " In his usual rumpled state , he eyed Waldo when he came in at the swinging door with a combination of envy and disfavor . Dark turtleneck jersey , lithe black trousers , black raincoat carelessly open , dark blue knitted sailor 's cap pulled down over his ears . " You look either like a goddam ballet dancer or a cat burglar , " he said . " I had to start from the head down to cover up the bandage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidy up our affairs I 'm going on to a birthday party . " And then , when his whiskey arrived , he asked his question about the house on Pine Street . Bernard , bolstered with drink and power , was expansive . " I could spot the rings , big ones , under those crazy gloves of hers . And if she was so proud of that chair she gave me a peek at , she might have had other stuff like it . My mother told me longDEATH BY BEQUEST 127ago about a collection of silver  --  and then her old man , Laura 's , was supposed to be rich as God , he built that house , there may be a lot of old out-of-date knickknacks . . . " Having excited himself with his guesses and hopes and fantasies , he said , " We may have a bloody goldmine on our hands ! " " Take it easy , " Waldo said . " So far it 's just a reasonably valuablepiece of real estate sitting on a tough market , people are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 'm not prepared to wait months , or even weeks , " Bernard said , signaling for another whiskey . " So I gather . " Waldo picked up his glass , took a drink , and studied his hand at close range . Perfectly steady . He had rehearsed his script in the Mercedes , on the way to McGettigan 's . The words came out just as he had intended them to do , bitten-off , unwilling and sullen . " This burning business could be a bluff but you 're "  --  he put a finger to the wound under the cap and the bandage  --  " not a man of what I 'd call normal behavior . And then , Celia 's thought all along that while you have n't a legal claim you have an unwritten one of sorts . " Should he chance another whiskey ? Yes . He needed it . " We 're pretty well over the barrel financially speaking . Peanutsof course in the checking account , a few odds and ends tied up in mutual funds which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Bernard would expect a wail about money . The other man grinned . " You 're making what the Irish call a poor mouth , " he said . " As you said to me over the phone this morning , shove it . Do n't tell me a man like you  --  your name over the door , your own business on Madison Avenue  --  ca n't raise money in an emergency . " " Then you wo n't see reason and wait till the house is sold ? " " No . Now . Or , you might say , now or never , there wo n't be any house to be sold . " Waldo sighed . " I spent summers here when I was in school , with a friend who is to say the least loaded . Dunfawny House , between Malahide and Swords . He breeds horses .

He came back visibly , for Bernard , from the pleasant cool green summers of his youth , the horses and the woods and the meadows , the gray stone Georgianhouse mistily asleep in the sun or ghostly in the rain . Voice crisp and harshly edged , he said , " With the wildest kind of luck , I can probably get ten thousand from him . Dollars , that is , not pounds . " He watched the expressions chasing themselves over Bernard'sface : triumph , greed , astonishment ; then doubt in his triumph , and another lick of greed . Walking on eggs , as though the miraculous vision of actual cash in hand would vanish , Bernard said , " Well , great to start with . But that 's nowhere near . . . " Waldo waved an impatient hand . " After probate , you 're to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever it brings , for you , you 'll have a nice legal letter from us to that effect . " " Well now . " Bernard beamed . " On that , Waldo , let 's have another drink . " " No , not another drink . You 're driving us to Dunfawny House . The car 's just down the alley . " He put his hand to his head again and closed his eyes for a moment . " I thought a couple of times on the way here I was going to conk out , thanks to you and your fist . " " Okay , fine , " Bernard said . " I only hope I remember to stay on the left . Put your money away . This is my treat . " They drove up the coast road , north ; the same way the St. Clairs had gone to Kelley Kelly 's house . Bernard was inclined to be propitiatory . He felt an iciness and tension coming from Waldo , on the leather seat beside him . Mind-changing at this point would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... it must have been nice , when you were a kid , coming over here to stay . Horses and things . I always wanted to ride a horse . . . Westerns I suppose , clouds of dust , I liked the sounds of the hoofs ... " Waldo wanted no part of the proposed companionship and sharing of interests . He answered the stumbling confidence with contemptuous silence . Does n't like being the low man , Bernard thought . He 's used to it way up there at the top . Giving orders , not taking them . He felt a need to assert himself again . " How far away is this place ? And what 's the drill when we get there ? " " Ten more miles or so . you 'll wait in the car for obvious reasons . " Waldo took the last cigarette from his case and gave a short savage push to the dashboard lighter . Uses it like a weapon , Bernard told himself , what if when it gets hot he holds it against my face or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of driving , the dark silent countryside , the taut stranger beside him . Triumph was leaking away along with the heat of rapidly consumed whiskey . Hang in there , he exhorted . It 's almost done . A nice fat certified check , a down payment that would clinch his ownershipof his factory . They descended the long hill where the Mercedes had been stopped on the grass verge a few nights before , and up another slope . " Turn left here , " Waldo said . The headlights , as Bernard obediently swerved the wheel , caught an abandoned , broken white stucco farmhouse close to the road , its windows black and gaping , its thatched roof sagging . " Left again . " " You 're sure ? It 's nothing but a bloody lane . " " I 'm sure . " Bernard put the car in second ; this hill was almost as steep as the face of a cliff . At the bottom , there was a stream with a humped stone bridge over it and beyond the bridge another130 DEATH BY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , windowless . " Stop a minute , " Waldo said . " I have to pee . " Not wanting , at this godforsaken end of nowhere to let his passenger out of his sight , Bernard said , " Good idea , me too . " He saw without thinking about it as he got out of the car Waldo reaching for the glove compartment and snapping it open . Flashlight , maybe . Or no , it must have been a fresh pack of cigarettes he was reaching for , he saw the glow from the lighter on Waldo 's face . Waldo walked behind the stone hut , turned around , waited a moment , listening , then walked back toward the car and when Bernard was six feet away from it shot him , at close range , three times , through the head . The great shout of noise began receding into a gasping cry as the big heavy body plunged in slow motion forward , taking what seemed like forever to hit the ground . Listen again . Listen with every pore of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shots never stop re-echoing from the sheer hill behind them ? Headlights smote him , from the top of the hill . Bernard 's body in its slow crash had efficiently hidden itself close along the car on the side away from the lane . A cautious driver , taking the descent slowly , to judge from the headlights . Waldo stepped over the body and got into the car and moved behind the wheel . The other car , a battered Ford Anglia , drew to a stop in the lane , beside the Mercedes . A man 's voice , soft , old , friendly , asked , " Are you in trouble then ? Out of gas is it ? I thought I heard backfiring  --  " " No . " Waldo put his head halfway out the window , willing the kind eyes to look at him , at this knitted cap and blackrimmedWoolworth glasses , and at nothing else . " Call of nature , just stopped for a minute , thanks anyway . I heard the backfiring too , ahead somewhere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And the same to you . " DEATH BY BEQUEST 131The Anglia moved leisurely forward , climbed the opposite hill and disappeared . The night was empty . Waldo switched off the headlights and stole a few precious seconds to accustom his eyes to the darkness . He reached again into the glove compartment and got out a folded heavy plastic bag . He bent and with swift precision got the bag over Bernard'shead and chest and secured it with nylon twine . A great weight to drag , and the plastic was slippery , but the distance was short . Down a sloping soft earth path to the stone shepherd 's hut . Deserted in the long-ago summers , deserted still , as he had verified during the day 's various vital explorations . The door was half off its hinges . He allowed himself the pencil illumination from a tiny pocket flashlight when he had pulled the door to again . The damp cold bit at him . There was a trap door cut into the stone floor , with a heavy rusted iron ring at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it in their wanderings , had thought it was probably a hiding place for illegally distilled poteen . The cavity under the floor was about eight feet deep and six feet long , with an iron ladder hanging against its wall . A final push , a soft thudding crash , and then the gentle loweringof the stone slab . It was three inches thick and fitted tightly , cleanly back into place . The pencil of light flicked the floor again . No blood , not a drop . He examined the plaid wool muffler he had taken from Bernard'sbody and thrust into his raincoat pocket . Bloodless too . There was blood on the gorse and grass beside the car but no doubt a helpful rainfall would soon dispense with it , wash away the last visible trace of Bernard Caldwell , deceased . CHAPTER 17Waldo had been gone for an hour and a half . It seemed a long time for a simple business proposition but then Bernard was n't a simple man , but a sort of human thunderstorm . She occupied her restless hands in wrapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk robe , a leather flask of heathery cologne , a pocket computer ; Waldo liked gadgets , played with them briefly , and then discreetly let them disappear . How nice , how easy Christmas shopping had been when she was very young and very broke , she thought with a pang of nostalgia . Most of it done in half an hour at Woolworth 's . And you could n't pay Waldo back with a heap of pretty packages , for not wanting to be his wife any more . The ringing of the telephone sent a shock down her spine . It was Waldo , his voice peculiar . " Christ , I 've been waiting all this time and he has n't shown up yet  --  has he called there by any chance ? " " No . . . had n't you better come back ? " Shd did n't like the sound of him at all ; but then he was probably beside himself with raging impatience . " I 'll give him fifteen more minutes and myself one more drink . McGettigan 's by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holidayor anniversary glass in . " " I 've ordered your birthday dinner ; to be served up here about eight-thirty , " Celia said , feeling as if it was someone else talking . " I did n't think you 'd want to or should go out again . " The kitchen had been pleasantly cooperative , yes , indeed , DEATH BY BEQUEST 133the gentleman 's birthday  --  Waldo 's favorite chicken breasts with mushrooms and artichoke hearts , in champagne sauce , an endive salad dressed with Roquefort whipped into wine vinegar , a small chocolate cake with a candle in the center . Waldo allowed himself cake once a year . He laughed ; again an odd sound , no merriment in it . " Birthdaydinners in the middle of all this  --  all right , I wo n't be long . I suppose he wo n't put the place to the torch until he finishes trying to screw me blind . He probably ran into the open end of a bottle somewhere else ... " It was close to an hour before the door opened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been running . Worried at his pallor , she said , " Well , did he finally  --  ? " " No , goddammit . I can only figure he got cold feet , thought I might be bringing the police with me  --  " He put both hands to his bare bandaged head . Celia had at no time been interested in her bequest ; now the house , the haunting house , seemed to her a grim burden , a menace , Laura Gore bent on sending misery along to them from the depths of the family mausoleum . The house had pushed Bernard into the center of their existence , Bernard and his savage attack on the Green , and a just remotely possible shove in the back on Grafton Street . Waiting for Waldo , she had been entirely with Cy ; to make up for it , she gave him a surface tenderness and care , brought him aspirin , put a testing palm against his damp forehead , fixed him a drink and made one for herself . However many drinks he had consumed while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't what was wrong with him . What was wrong with him ? Besides an unkept appointment ? She lifted her glass . " Happy birthday again , Waldo . " " Happy birthday ! " He got up and came over to her , pulledher to her feet and put his arms hard around her , burying his head against her neck . " Celia . . . for my birthday present , I 'm proposing marriage to you , our marriage . Will you be my wife , darling ? " 134 DEATH BY BEQUESTIn some way outraged , she tried to move away . His arms were like iron . " Celia , please . I know about Cy , I know these things happen , but you have n't given either of us enough time to deal with it  --  " She went very still against him . Horrifyingly , he started to shake , his body beating like a drum . " Darling . . . you ca n't , I need you . . . I feel lost . . . I feel like a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " If only he would stop shaking . Blithe Waldo , on top of things . Imperturbable , Cy had called him . Now , clutching her desperately , now at this moment a ruin . She was totally unable to speak . He lifted his head and his eyes , near , burned into hers as they had when she woke to find him watching her in the silent early morning dark . " Six months , please , Celia ? " Please was n't one of Waldo 's usual words . " That is n't too long to ask , after five years .. . please . Jesus , I thought when I saw the empty bed before I came out here and found you that you 'd packed up and gone off to him  --  " In his present state and hers , she found it impossible to bring out an immediate flat refusal to his request . And was she tremblingnow , or was it merely her flesh picking up the rhythm of his ? Her head felt as if it were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be talked about , but  --  " She hardly knew what she was saying . Talked about ? The fact that she was wholly , bone-deep , committed to another man ? " All right , try to stop shaking , you scare me . . . " Like a child , he put his knuckles into his eyes . She had never before seen him cry . He turned his head sharply away . " Have another drink , Waldo , and come back to the human race , " he said . " But first wash your face in cold water . " On his way back to his chair and his drink , he bent and lightly kissed her hair . She felt very cold and very empty . She managed a smile , got up with relief at the knocking on theDEATH BY BEQUEST 135door . Something , anything , to get over this encounter and its implications , echoing in her ears . The dinner table was wheeled in with a flourish . A glistening array of covered dishes , lighted candles in crystal holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and yellowtulips . They went through the motions , unfolded napkins , clinked glasses of pale golden chablis , determinedly lifted forks . Waldo managed about half a chicken breast , got up abruptly , and went into the bathroom . She heard from behind the closed door the retching noises . Yes , Great-aunt Laura , thank you very much for your house . Cy , lonely in his big room at the Gresham , furnished it with Celia . Standing by the window , lamplight catching her shining hair . Pushing up her glasses into the brown shimmer when he bent his head to kiss her , and saying on a breath of laughter , " I hope I 'll know who it is without my glasses , yes , I do , it 's Cy is n't it , Cyril Francis Hall . " He had spent a restless afternoon prowling the National Galleryof Ireland , Dublin Castle , and streets and streets of the faintly sad finery of once grand Georgian houses still speaking in faraway voices of laces and satins , balls and smart uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . Now , unable to sit , to bury himself in his book or a newspaper , he stared at the telephone , willing it to do its job . Ring , produce information , reassurance , answer all the doubts , all the puzzles , all the questions . There were a lot of them . He felt a strong uneasiness about Celia , about the whole business , that would n't go away . Why , really , were they here at all , so far from home , where Bernard could be dealt with ? He did n't fully believe in Waldo 's attempt to save his marriage . Even when he had first heard it , it did n't sound right , it did n't sound like Waldo. 136 DEATH BY BEQUESTPassing Irena Tova 's half-open door the day before he left for Paris , he had heard her soft possessive creamy voice , a dropped phrase or so . . . " Yes , Waldo darling , I am being beautifully good . . . well , yes , but it wo n't be long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover put firmly aside , given up as a bad habit . There was a sense of expectancy and lazy joy coming from her . He neither liked nor disliked Waldo . His partner was passionatelydevoted to his work , a good and subtle salesman , an entertaining and amiable associate . After all these years he was still somewhat of an unknown quantity . Gracefully self-assured , even a little secretive . Not a direct man ; given to smiling plans , manipulations , as though following the adage that the longest way round is the shortest way home . Shattered . He kept coming back to the word . About a piece of real estatein Philadelphia ? He remembered Waldo saying to him , concerning the house , in answer to a casual polite inquiry , " Okay place , big , a bit shabby , and it may take months to sell . And then the capital gains tax ... It 's nothing to fire off Roman candles about . " The St. Clairs lived comfortably and as far as he was aware had no vast debts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her use of words , not given to overstatement . But this had been her spontaneous description of Waldo 's reaction to the bizarre threat . He remembered too , as his eyes prodded the phone , willing it to ring , that Celia had told him the sudden unwelcome decision to go away , to Ireland , had been presented to her the eveningWaldo had come back from looking over her aunt 's house . And now the house was , in a sense , being held for ransom by the erratic violent cousin . Could , for some reason or another possibly connected with Pine Street , Waldo be wanting to preserve his marriage , keep his wife at his side , for plain hardheaded financial reasons ? DEATH BY BEQUEST 137Nothing to do with vows , repentance , a fresh start  --  merely fasten her firmly to him again , hold on just as firmly to Irena , because from every worldly point of view it was more convenientfor him , more practical . It seemed to him to make greater sense than a sudden romanticturnabout . Feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ordered ice , poured scotch , and then for want of something more constructive to do went to the uncooperative telephone and put in a call to his friend John Van Loon in Philadelphia . Van Loon , who did n't need the money but liked to have something to keep him occupied , owned a small elegant store on lower Pine Street in which he sold paintings and prints , antiques , and expensive greenery . " Gore . . . Gore ? " he mused in answer to Cy 's inquiry . " Let me think . As a matter of fact , I 'm right in the middle of selling an etagere , she 's almost ripe and ready to spring for it .. . hang on a minute or so , you can afford it . " Coming back to the phone , he said , " Done ! Now , Gore Back in my great-grandfather 's day , he had a rich pal named Gore , Nathaniel I think , five or six houses , a yacht  --  1 only remember the name because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while at sea , and great-grandpa fell overboard and almost drowned . Not at all the thing you like to connect with these Episcopalian ancients . Shall I lo. , k Ian , it further ? " " Will you ? There 's a woman , dead , who may have been his daughter . . . " He gave Van Loon the details quickly , thinking of Celia perhaps needing him badly and getting a busy signal . Silence . Perhaps by now a candlelit birthday dinner was in progress . This did not bear much thinking about . He had another scotch , trying to gather the bits and pieces together . The house might be entirely irrelevant ; he might be being swayed by the vagaries of his own business , relatives rousingthemselves from their fresh grief wanting to know if Mother 's collection of paintings might be valuable ? 138 DEATH BY BEQUESTHe himself had made discoveries , thrilling ones , in unlikely attics and closets . A rich pal named Gore , a clutch of houses , a yacht , and perhaps a daughter named Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gloves on her hands for fear of dirt .. . Underlining the house was Caldwell . His fanatical determi- nation to pry loose a share of it , which had brought him across the Atlantic , a trip he could surely ill afford . But , round and round . Why not stay in New York , Waldo , to run new riches through your fingers ? The story about Mrs. Donahue 's pressing desire for her Irish paintings had n't been founded on fact . Easy and obvious , that one : get her away from his partner Cy Hall while he tried to mend his fences , erase the hovering word divorce . To hell with fastidious hanging back . He lifted the phone and dialed the St. Clairs ' room . Celia answered in a voice that could have been considered furtive until she explained just above a whisper that Waldo was sleeping , or trying to , in the bedroom . " What happened , with Caldwell ? " Cy demanded . " Has he been disposed of ? " " No . " She murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at McGettigan 's pub . Very slowly , Cy said , " If I were n't unfortunately civilized , I 'd say , come away with me , Celia , right now . " There was a silence . He thought he detected tears , recent or present , in the low voice . " I could n't anyway , civilized or not ... I promised Waldo another six months , to try to . . . heTreacherous , impossible , to describe the brief awful crackup , even to Cy . It was his turn for silence . Out of a cold rage , he said , " God you 're easy to con . I hope your cousin does n't get his hands on you . " He was immediately and bitterly sorry . DEATH BY BEQUEST 139Six months could be dealt with , one way or another ; she was for life , his life . " To get back to the matter in hand , I do n't understand it . He 's pulled his ultimate threat , short of holding a gun at your head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his hands . And then he does n't show up . " He felt her trying to gather herself together . " Waldo thought at the last minute he might have been afraid he 'd have the law with him . " " So there he still is , or there he still is n't , " Cy said , trying to hold down another kind of anger . " What 's your  --  marital deci- sion now ? Sit and wait with folded hands ? " Sounding as if , wearily , she did n't give a damn about what happened now , she said , " What else would you suggest , Cy ? " " I 'll try to think of something . In the meantime "  --  this did n't seem a moment for endearments  --  " good night . " As , muscles almost aching with the sense of frustration , help- lessness , he strode the room , his eye fell on the Irish Times flapped over a chair arm . He picked it up , turned to the classified ads , found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a bit of a rush  --  I assume this will appear tomorrow morning ? Good . " And then he dictated : " For reasons of finan- cial benefit to him , will Mr. Bernard Caldwell or anyone know- ing of his whereabouts get in touch with Mr. C. H. at the Gresham . " He gave his room telephone number and added , " Speed in this matter is of the utmost importance to Mr. Cald- well . "
