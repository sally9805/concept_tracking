The time : possibly a few weeks from now . The negotiations in Paris have been successful , and a cease-fire has been declared in Viet Nam . But instead of peace , there is a spate of small-scale skirmishes as both sides make a frenzied rush to claim contested land . Every day there are reports of assassinations-of both South Vietnamese government officials and suspected Communist sympathizers . Almost every town in the land is subjected to a cacophony of demonstrations , celebrations and parades . There is also a deadly serious war of flags , as each side plants its banners in as many villages as possible , and tears down those of its opponent . By the time the proposed international supervisory commission arrives , " peace " in Viet Nam has become another kind of war . <P> That scenario is not entirely imaginary . On the evidence of captured Communist documents and the public and private edicts of South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu , it is the most probable aftermath of any ceasefire . Both sides have for months been preparing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political future of South Viet Nam as much as any battle of the past . <P> Within 72 hours after an agreement is signed in Paris , North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces plan a coordinated charge into Saigon-controlled cities , villages and rural hamlets . The crack North Vietnamese 7th Division , stationed north of Saigon , has had standing orders since October to " force enemy personnel to withdraw . Gain control of many more hamlets . Motivate the people and support them to rise up , kill tyrants and break the enemy 's oppressive control . " Another Communist directive orders units to " incite inhabitants to engage in street demonstrations to welcome the victories of the revolution , " and to " lead enemy troops ' dependents to their relatives ' posts to urge them to desert and return home . " <P> The Communists have been meticulous in planning a takeover of the key city of Danang , according to captured documents . When the agreement is broadcast , Communist troops will execute a two-part plan . Some units will make a concerted military assault on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time , other troops will " hang peace flags and lanterns , fly flower-decked balloons and hold unicorn dances traditional Vietnamese dance at a time of joy , entertainment shows and peace-float processions to create an enthusiastic atmosphere and rally a large number of people . In the event the enemy represses the demonstrators , " the directive adds , " we will carry the corpses of the demonstrators to city hall . " <P> Banner Battle . To subvert any strictures on new arms shipments , the Communists have ordered that weapons and munitions plants hidden in the jungles of Cambodia and Laos be smuggled piecemeal into South Viet Nam . ( For much the same reason , tons of equipment on U.S. bases have been formally donated to the South Vietnamese , then " loaned " back. )
