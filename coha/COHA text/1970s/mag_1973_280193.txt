Once upon a time , princesses automatically married princes or other noblemen , as surely as knights rescued damsels in distress . Not any more - not even British princesses . Last week , Buckingham Palace announced " with the greatest pleasure " the engagement of Queen Elizabeth 's only daughter , Anne Elizabeth Alice Louise Windsor , 22 , to Lieut . Mark Phillips , 24 , a hand some commoner in the Queen 's Dragoon Guards . <P> Anne had prepared Britons for the possibility of a nonroyal match from the time she grew into long-legged womanhood . " Princesses are getting a bit short on the marriage market , " she once noted . " I 'll soon be next , but they will have a job marrying me off to someone I do n't want . " Anne also had precedent going for her . Her aunt , Princess Margaret , now 42 , made the big break in 1960 , when she wed Antony Armstrong-Jones , an untitled photographer . Since then , three of the Queen 's cousins , Princess Alexandra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also chosen spouses outside the nobility . <P> Primrose Hue . Traditionalists , however , could take heart from the fact that Phillips is an uncommon commoner . His family is what the British refer to as " county " - people of comfortable means who have homes and stables in the counties and hold high business or professional positions , if they work at all . The Phillipses have a handsome 16th century house of Cotswold stone and primrose hue in Great Somerford , Wiltshire , about 80 miles west of London . Mark 's grandfather was an equerry to King George VI . His father , Peter Phillips , is a director of T. Wall &; Sons , a large produce firm that specializes in pork sausages and ice cream ( and which , incidentally , is an official purveyor to the Queen ) . Mark attended Marlborough College , one of Britain 's best public ( meaning private ) schools , before entering the Royal Military Academy , Sandhurst . Though he was an all-round athlete at school , his favorite sport is the same as Anne's-horse-riding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mexico City , when Phillips was a reserve member of the British equestrian team . They continued to bump into each other at other equestrian events . For a while , Anne , who won a European riding championship in 1971 , appeared smitten with another dashing horseman , Richard Meade , who gallantly rose to Anne 's defense last year when some blackguard suggested that her riding ability was overrated . Anne later cheered both Phillips and Meade as they won gold medals at the Olympic Games in Munich . <P> No Romance . Sadly for lovers of fairy tales , it turns out that the two men were not really competing for the spirited princess 's hand . London gossip has it that Meade was never a suitor but acted as a cover for Phillips . Anne , who inherits her father 's fondness for playing games with the press , contributed to the confusion . As recently as March , Anne royally fibbed that there was no romance between her and the strapping soldier . In fact , they actually became engaged in mid-April ; the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders and the Archbishop of Canterbury had been duly informed .
