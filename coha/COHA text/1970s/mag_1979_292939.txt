CONFESSIONS OF A CONSERVATIVE by Garry Wills ; Doubleday ; 231 pages ; $10 <P> Garry Wills calls himself a conservative , out of convenience . He would rather call himself a " convenientist , " a citizen always willing to convene with his countrymen for the public good . <P> Wills , 44 , is not an uncomplicated man . He is a Jesuit-trained classics scholar , historian , teacher and journalist with one of the most supple intellects now wrapped around the body politic . <P> The output of his books , articles and criticism is protean . It began 20 years ago when he was still a student at Xavier University in Cincinnati . William F. Buckley Jr. , impressed by a Wills piece on TIME style , offered him reviewing assignments for National Review . He turned in so many that he had to use a pseudonym ( William Roman ) " to keep from clogging the pages . " <P> Between 1959 and 1963 , Wills wrote books on Chesterton , Catholicism and Roman culture , in addition to working on a doctoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces in Esquire and the Saturday Evening Post established him as a journalist of the first rank . His Nixon Ag- onistes ( 1969 ) still has the longest shelf-life of any book on the former President . Last year Historian Wills published Inventing America , a fresh look at the roots of Jefferson 's Declaration of Independence . The work has already won several literary prizes . A few weeks ago , he was holed up in Williamsburg , Va. , completing a sequel at the rate of one chapter a day . Wills has also found time to write a suspense novel , At Button 's , conduct a weekly seminar for Johns Hopkins students at his home in Baltimore and meet three deadlines a week for his syndicated newspaper column " Outrider . " <P> How far out can a conservative ride ? In his Confessions , Wills ranges from Jack Ruby to Cardinal Newman , from Everett Dirksen 's Washington to St. Augustine 's City of God . The pace is brisk , the intellectual hurdles high , the glimpses of auto-biography charming but scattered . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eros generally , not Eros specifically , " Wills slings himself into Bill Buckley 's energetic orbit of lively conversation , sailboats and sports cars whose " constant whirrings down , fussy tuggings , and resumed flight seemed a nuisance rather than a luxury . " In a holding pattern over New York , Wills falls into conversation with a stewardess . The talk continues during the ride from the airport , but later the young journalist can not remember her name . A little subterfuge results in a new meeting and a marriage-now past its 20th year . By today 's matrimonial standards Wills is practically a radical . His ideas on love and the governing of men are also a departure from the customary lines . Wills ' starting point is St. Augustine : " A people is a gathering of many rational individuals united by accord on loved things held in common . " What rational individuals love best is peace . It is , says Wills , " the very soul of society " and " the gift of the politicians . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
