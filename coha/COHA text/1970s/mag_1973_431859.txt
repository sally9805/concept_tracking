 | Golden Ghosts of the Lost Sierra IT WAS FEBRUARY , the month of the deep snows , and a new storm had begun when I came with nightfall into La Porte . On the lonesome road up , I had surprised a doe that vanished into the forest gloom with one great dancer 's leap , a wildcat with short ears and wicked eyes that regarded me disdainfully , and a hawk plummeting down @# @#  | with outspread talons upon a squirrel that had lingered too long in a clearing . This was the " Lost Sierra , " an isolated , once all-but-forgotten corner of northeastern California that the forty-niners penetrated for gold . In the beginning most of them had abandoned their diggings with the first heavy snowfall and retreated to the protection of the lowlands and valleys below . Then , from Scandinavian miners , they had learned to make skis , and so had conquered a region that was snowbound for seven months of the year , with drifts as high as forty feet . In a ski museum at Boreal Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some faded photographs of women in long skirts and 333  | floppy hats and children in tight-fitting jackets ? all wearing skis . In the background , - ere houses with only the rooftops showing above the snow . It was these photographs that had first captured my curiosity and sent me , starting the summer before , in search of old mining camps with such exotic names as Poker Flat , Port Wine , Poverty Hill , Whiskey Diggings , and La Porte ( map , page 337 ) . In my explorings I was to learn that gold and snow were still inextricably entwined in the life of the Lost Sierra . Only 20 Face the Freeze Now in winter , the old saloon in the La Porte Hotel , built in 1906 , was frequented by a handful of the town 's 20 wintertime residents ( page 350 ) . There is a high stand-up bar with a brass railing , a ceiling fan , a player piano , and the inevitable print of " Custer 's Last Fight " in a huge frame on one wall . Outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked along it at night with the beginning slivers of snow pricking my face like needles . Though it was what the durable year-round residents called a mild winter , the street was banked by huge drifts . Next morning the snow was falling with determination , slanting like a white curtain across the window of my hotel room , obscuring the houses and tall trees beyond . I strapped on snowshoes , long and narrow " Indian webs , " for a solitary trek into the forest . In the undulating white wilderness , bushes and undergrowth and rocks were buried , and the trees so feathered with snow that they were more white than green . The woven track of my snowshoes filled in behind me as I tramped toward the nearby cabin of Pat C Kean , an old prospector I had met the summer before . It was snowing harder as I circled through the forest , and in the swirling flakes I experienced the brief panic that the Lost Sierrans of times past must have known when they were not sure their bearings were right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat 's Kelly-green cabin and the plume of smoke rising from its chimney . Stacking my snowshoes outside , I went in for the warming drink of Irish whiskey and the crackling fire I knew would be waiting there . " Pat , I 'm ashamed of myself , " I told him . " I almost got lost . " Pat had been busy waxing his ten-foot " long-board " skis for a walk into La Porte.  | His lean face , remarkably unlined for his 80 years , was kindly . ' T is nothing to be ashamed of , " he said in his lilting brogue . " I mind me the time I took a wrong canyon in a snowstorm and had to spend the night out in it , lying on top of a fire hole I dug in the snow . In the morning my face was as black as the ace of spades from all them smoking embers . " Pat O'Kean is to me the epitome of the eternal gold seeker of the Lost Sierra . He had lived through 40 winters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his way , he would still be there . But he broke his back going over the side of the road in a truck four years ago , and that put a stop to his 30-mile round-trip ski treks from Poker Flat to La Porte and Downieville for mail and provisions . Pat moved to the winter cabin near La Porte , but his injury does not prevent him from returning to Poker Flat to pan for gold as soon as the snow melts ( page 339 ) . I 'd met Pat toward the end of my summer sortie into the mountain fastness that e the Lost Sierra , when the green lan was a disarming contrast to the sce snow around us now . From the time I tered Beckwourth Pass till Pat introduced to the decaying mysteries of his Poker region , I seemed to have moved back a tury and more , to a place where the pion - spirit still etched the land and the ch. of its people . Forty-niners Off to a Skiing Start On that summer 's exploration my was William Berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-the-way region when stumbled upon it 40 years ago . A vibrant whose energy and hardy frame belie his years , he is the official historian for the U. Ski Association , and among the first to prove that organized ski racing in the United St. began with the forty-niners . With Bill Berry , I meandered through tiny @# National Geographic , September 1973 Gold (  | farming and logging communities to the pper reaches of the Feather River 's Middle ork ? a chain of ponds connected by only the slightest ripple of movement from one to other . It was hard to reconcile this tranillity with the mighty onrush of water that periodically devastated the lowland trading d farming centers and turned the Sacramento Valley into a sea of mud and water . The answer lay in the winter snows of the ominous mountains looming in the distance . Today the Feather and Yuba Rivers , along with their tributaries , are being harnessed by dams to provide a power source for northern California . Nestled between two forks of the Feather River is Quincy , a lumbermill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I talked there with big , genial Francis O'Rourke . Until motorized vehicles penetrated the Lost Sierra on improved roads after 1912 , the O'Rourke  | family for years had run horse-drawn stages in summer and sleighs in winter , carrying supplies and mail into the high mountains and bringing back gold and mail . The old route ? the wagon road first hacked out by the early wagon trains ? crossed a ridge known as The Hogback . " Summers were easy going then if you had the stomach for looking down 2,000 feet , " Francis O'Rourke told me . " But winters were another thing , with howling blizzards and snowslides . We could only go as far as Nelson Point , and there the skiers from La Porte would meet us . The men would load up 50-pound packs , and the kids hauled supplies on sleds and corrugated iron sheets . " When I asked him how his stage horses could make it through the drifts , he answered , " They wore snowshoes . Metal contraptions a foot wide , with felt or rubber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoof . " " Did they take to them ? " I asked . " Most did but some did n't . Some never could catch on , but we had one black mare that could walk a tightrope with them . " I told O'Rourke we were going to jeep next day over the same old-time wagon roac to La Porte . He said , with a dismissing wave of his hand , " It 's a superhighway now . " If the route 's 35-mile ribbon of rocky one ? track road was Francis O'Rourke 's idea of a superhighway , it was n't mine . It was , ho ever , hauntingly beautiful . Falls of cold , cle water cascaded down over moss-cover rocks , eventually to reach the Middle Fork the Feather River . In one placid pool a lo deer raised his dripping head to watch o passage . The constant waterfalls were so i viting that I stripped and stepped into one . The force of the icy water drove me to my knees , and I emerged gasping . As we climbed higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is one of the deeper and more inaccessible canyons in the Sierra Nevada , and many parts of it may never have known the footfall of man The trees at the bottom of it seemed no larger than spikes of grass , and the river was only a silver vein . When we crossed over the last high rim  | and penetrated the heart of the Lost Sierra , we were surrounded by dark groves of pine d fir interlaced with delicate hues of maple d oak . Heady scents of wild flowers cut through the hot pine smell in the air . Mythical Lake Led the Way to Real Gold This was the mountain bastion the fortyniners had stormed in search of fabled Gold Lake . Thousands of miners had become disillusioned with the hard work required to get gold out of the Mother Lode country . All they needed to trigger a rush into the region was the legend of Gold Lake . In 1849 a half-starved man named Stoddard staggered out of the mountains with a handful of nuggets and a tale about a lake whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking Stoddard as its guide , ided to find out whether the tale was true , d hundreds of miners fell in behind . Stoddard led them on a wild-goose chase for weeks , the story goes , and they never did find the lake . His followers , enraged at being ade fools of , set up an impromptu miners ' court and , for his deception , sentenced Stoddard to hang . But he escaped into the forest , only to turn up again several years later , trying to revive interest in the lake lined with chunks of gold . In their quest for the mythical Gold Lake , a few tenacious miners made promising strikes along Lost Sierra creeks . When news of that got out , the mountains were deluged by miners , merchants , and gamblers ? a goldrush potpourri of Yankees , English , Irish , Scots , Scandinavians , Chinese , Latin Americans , and Hawaiians . Some were veteran miners who passed their skill along to their inexperienced companions . In four decades they extracted 93 million dollars in gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness are nearly gone . Many have vanished , their sturdier buildings moved to towns like La Porte ; the others have been completely recaptured by the forest . What little remained of old bottles , iron beds , and discarded skis was taken away by souvenir hunters . At Whiskey Diggings alone , there had been  | 20 mining camps in a small perimeter . Now they are marked by little cemeteries with illegible wooden grave boards and a jumble of brown-board ruins . It is as if the houses , untenanted and uncared for , held on as long as they could , and then collapsed in upon themselves with a weary sigh . At uninhabited Gibsonville , Bill Berry and I rummaged through the remnants of one of those old houses . I found a pair of delicately turned skis that had belonged to a child and gave them to Bill for his Western America Skisport Museum at Boreal Ridge . There he has gathered a formidable display of longboard skis as part of his personal crusade to revive the lost art of long-board ski racing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , " he said . " The Scandinavians jumping ship in San Francisco to join the gold rush taught the forty-niners to make these Norway skates . ' " Before my first venture into the Lost Sierra , I had seen Bill Berry 's museum collection of prodigious skis from 10 to nearly 13 f length . They seemed to me impossibly bersome , and I said as much . In answer showed me photographs of old-time r with high laced boots poised for a run s . terrifyingly sheer slopes ( page 342 ) . " I 'm convinced , " Bill said , " that they reached speeds unequaled in down-mountain racing to . Towns Live On Only in Memory I was to recall the ghosted gold camp Gibsonville later , in astonished retros when I visited with 80-year-old Eliza . - Merian in Oroville . She told me she had spent her youth in Gibsonville . " You have to imagine those towns as I . them , " she said . " The houses were pain - white , and there were picket fences . flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with kids had a cow f milk and butter , and a calf and pigs for me " In the winter the houses were often bun - under mountains of snow , fifteen to twenty @#  | feet deep . When the storms began , we had to lengthen our chimneys to let smoke escape , and we dug slanting access tunnels down to the attic windows , the snow was that deep . Inside , we burned lamps all day for light . But winter was n't a sad time at all . The grownups had sewing circles , card parties , and dancing to the fiddles . Us kids skied all day long ? but we called it snow-shoeing ' then . " She regarded me with a mischievous smile . " I was a racer , you know , and I raced in short skirts . That really scandalized ' em . " A few miles down the road from Elizabeth Merian 's beloved Gibsonville lies La Porte , the hub of the Lost Sierra . In the early 1860 's , at least 3,000 people lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days was a hydraulicmining center . Taking advantage of the pressure of water drawn from higher up , great hoses tore at gravel deposits and washed gold-bearing sand into races and sluice boxes . Every year the spring runoff gathered up the waste material loosened from hillsides by hydraulic mining and carried the entire mass into the Sacramento Valley . This eventually prompted a federal law in 1893 which attached such rigid controls that hydraulic mining died out in California . That meant the end of the big days for the already dying La Porte . Today only 80 people live there , even in summer . The town has dwindled to a single hotel , a general store , two saloons , a number of houses , and neat rows of cabins once occupied by miners . Suggestive of a cathedral aisle , the main street is wide and flanked on both sides by towering pines . La Porte 's general store , owned by Truman Gould ( page 334 ) , is the year-round town center , being also the post office and gas station . Until it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of gold scales was employed to measure out miners ' nuggets and gold dust in exchange for goods . " There are n't many miners left these days , "  | Truman told me . " The townfolk are the steady income . But I also cater to loggers , road crews , and lots of fishermen , hunters , and campers . Not many of them as colorful as the old prospectors . " They were a curious breed . I never had the gold bug , but with them it was a fever . There was that Luxembourger fellow , found a pocket of gold that brought him $800 . He spent the next years tunneling the mountain where he 'd made the strike . He never found another nugget , but he kept on saving , I 'm just a few feet away from fortune . ' When he died at 84 , " Truman added dryly , " that fortune was still just a few feet away . " The Mail Went Through ? on Skis Back at the La Porte Hotel , in the saloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Francis O'Rourke I 'd met in Quincy . A blueeyed , ruddy Irishman , Dick had been one of the area 's last mail carriers on skis . " I guess it was a hard life , " he said , " though I did n't think anything about it then . I would start out from La Porte and make the climb to Howland Flat . I wore the long-boards and carried a canvas mail sack weighing fifty to sixty pounds on my back . Going uphill , I slipped moccasins ' of mattress ticking onto my skis for traction . I rubbed charcoal under my eyes , but even then , there were times when I got nearly snow blind . In heavy storms I just would n't go out , except in extreme emergencies . " It was in the same saloon that I had first met Pat O'Kean . We fell to talking about Poker Flat and Pat agreed to guide me there . We jeeped down a dirt road cut through miles of loose rock piled so deep on the hillsides that nothing could grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While we bumped along , Pat talked of how he had come to the Lost Sierra . He had been born in Ireland , and had worked in mines near Los Angeles . " I had me a partner , " said Pat , " an IrishEnglish lad , called Whitey . He got the urge to see the Sierra gold country . When he came back , he said , Ye have got to see it . It 's the new country . ' I said I would go for two weeks , and , by jingo , I found a nugget , and I 've been here ever since . " He added philosophically , " I 've made enough to live all these years , sometimes S20 a day in the short season , between snows . That 's all a man can ask for . I never had much patience with the jcind who hate a man because he had the good luck and the knowhow to make a million . " Poker Flat today is only a ghost of what it was in 1852 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tributaries , or tunneled into its sharply rising slopes . When we jeeped through what was passable of the long narrow valley , we saw a dozen houses in various stages of ruin , and a lone miner . The miner , Vern Overby , explained that he worked his claim only in the summers . He showed us two magnificent gold nuggets he had found after a rainstorm uncovered them . I should never have felt their water-worn smoothness growing warm in my palms , because I was instantly seized with gold fever . Water and Patience Do the Trick After that I was hard put to tear myself away from clambering over the boulderstrewn creek in search of nuggets . I would not be content until Pat O'Kean showed me how to pan gravel mixed with water . Dexterously he rocked the pan with circular motions . tipping it from side to side to let the goldbearing sand work its way to the bottom . " The secret is in letting the water do the work , " said Pat . " That and patience . " Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to understand the disappointment that had sent all but a lucky few back out of the California gold country penniless . " The Chinee were the ones with true patience , " Pat told me as we sat on the brokendown stoop of the house in which he had lived for so much of his life . " The white men always looked for the rich stuff . They took the cream and moved on . Then the Chinee would  | work the same gulches and pick up a lot of fine gold . But when they left a gulch , there was nothing left for nobody . " Across Canyon Creek was a log cabin that seemed to have weathered the years better than most . When I asked Pat about it , he said , " That cabin was built in the Depression . I was the only resident here , and then , one by one , they began coming in until there was 350 people here , if ye can believe it . Good people who were too proud to go on relief . They lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly panning . It was enough to keep food in their stomachs . " He gestured to the cabin . " The luckiest one of them all was a rambling lad who built that cabin . He could n't have been 12 years old . he had run away from home , and he had neither family nor friends here . I was working my sluice box on the bank when he first come down the mountain , whistling as lads will . He had a pick and a shovel and a pan , and when I asked him where he was going to try his luck , he said , Right down there below . ' Well , I 'll be jingoed but he did n't pick the only spot on the creek that had n't been worked . He comes back up to me with his hands full of $10 and $20 nuggets , and says , @#  | Is this good ? ' I 'm here to tell ye I nearly fainted . Before that lad left here to seek his fortune elsewhere , he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abound in the Lost Sierra ? of a man who in firing at a game bird dislodged a piece of ore that marked a strike ; of a miner who noticed a string of ants carrying precious specks and followed them to a rich pocket ; of a highway construction crew that unearthed a promising vein , left their machines , went digging like crazy , and took out metal worth $70,000 . Gold mining in the Lost Sierra has just about come down to a hobby . There are no full-time company operations remaining , because an operator ca n't make enough above the $50-a-day cost of employing and feeding a mine worker . But the recent rise in the price of gold has brought on a surge of weekend prospectors and could stimulate the reopening of company operations . Panning can be a profitable hobby . In Poker Flat I talked to young Don Albrecht . On weekends sandwiched into his job as a postal employee , Don pans in the mountain creeks . Pouring out a pouchful of nuggets into my hand , he said , " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for a sniper . ' "  |  A sniper , he explained , is gold-country vernacular for the occasional miner who , with gold pan and suction dredge , probes for nuggets in crevices and bedrock ridges along stream banks . Scuba diving has added a new dimension to prospecting techniques . At the ghost camp of Scales I found bearded , long-haired Cliff Sasselli , who scuba dives in deep creeks and old hydraulic pits ( page 341 ) . When I saw him in late autumn , he was patching up an old cabin and laying in health foods and firewood against the imminent snows . " For the past three summers my wife and I have been living and gold hunting in the area , " he said , " but this year , we 're going to try and make out the winter . We wo n't have electricity , but we 've got kerosene lanterns and that old cast-iron stove . " I asked about the three children , ranging in age from 8 years to 3 months . He told me he had delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do all right , " he said . " If they get sick , we 'll just take care of them ourselves , and if necessary , go for help . " When I went back to La Porte in winter , I learned that Cliff and his family had indeed managed to stick it out through the tr. times ? like the pioneers and their child of a century or so ago . No Nostalgia for the " Good Old Days " Crusty Jim Dugan , with the gaunt face gnarled hands of 86 years , had been one those pioneer children . Bill Berry and I with him on a worn bench beside a wo boardwalk in Downieville . The sunlight w hazy with autumn , and there was the scent of dying leaves in the air . Jim Dugan 's grandfather had been among the " Gold Lakers " who had settled the Low Sierra . His mother had raised ten children in Poker Flat , and his father had been an lucky miner " who just managed to get alon " People looked up to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He w a sort of preacher , and he buried a lot of people in Poker Flat . If they was Catholic , he gave them a Catholic funeral . If they was Methodist , he gave them a Methodist funeral Pausing in afterthought , he added , " It was n't all that easy to bury the dead in winter . We @#  | had to dig through 18 feet of snow and 6 feet of dirt . " I made the mistake of remarking nostalgically , " Still and all , those must have been good times to live in . " Jim Dugan snorted . " I hear people on the TV talking about the good old days , " he said . " Well , in the good old days , you could n't hardly make enough to keep a dog alive . Listen , mister . Every time you wake up in the morning , you better shake hands with yourself for living now . " Jim 's temper cooled and his eyes lighted up when Bill Berry asked whether he had known many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , " Jim Dugan said , " even Tommy Todd . Tommy was the one , you know , who made the fastest time of all ? a 500-yard run in 13 seconds , and that from a standing start . " Bill interrupted . " That could have been an all-time speed record over a short run . " " I would n't doubt it , " Jim Dugan said . " These boys who race now could n't hold a candle to the long-board riders . And you know the reason why ? Short skis , that 's why ! " On my last trip into the Lost Sierra , in winter , I saw a revival of the old long-board racing . Bill Berry had offered his treasured museum pieces , skis ? some almost 13 feet long ? handcrafted of spruce and fir , bent and tempered in boiling water , and saturated with pine tar . The day of the race dawned dazzlingly clear , and we went into the backcountry beyond Sierraville on whining snowmobiles . Then the youthful racers ? most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the hill . While we were waiting beside the redflagged finish line for the race to begin , I talked with Johnny Redstreake ( page 343 ) and Jerry Burelle , two of the last long-board racers . Their racing days were over , but they had volunteered to wax the long skis with the secret concoctions that had been handed down from the early ski makers . I asked Johnny about the classic confrontation between long-boards and modern skis in 1941 , when he competed with Hannes Schroll , a former U. S. champion . " Hannes was a nice man , " he reminisced ,  | " but he could n't hide a grin when he saw me getting into my long-boards . I was set to teach him a lesson , and I went all the way out . My skis were rattling like rifle shots , and I could n't see two feet in front of me , because , you know , I was averaging more than 60 miles an hour . But I had aimed my balance pole like a gun to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just sighted along that and kept to the grooved track . " He chuckled . " Hannes Schroll was one surprised man . He told me afterward , Never did I believe that skis could go so fast . ' " There was a warning shout from the top of the hill , and two racers in the first heat pushed off . When they hurtled between the red flags , they were an unrecognizable blur of speed . In trying to brake down with his wooden balance pole on the runout , one of them fell . The long-boards sailed off to the side , but the downed racer performed cartwheels that seemed to have no end . Finally , he sat up and grinned dazedly . " Boy , those things move ! " he said . When the races finished , I asked young Don Demosthenes , a ski racer from Nevada , what it was like on the long-boards . " It 's a weird feeling , " he said . " You have no control , no turning , no nothing . You just go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece . " He paused in reflection . " It 's not only the long skis , " he said . " It 's that wax they put on . That 's something ! " I went to see Jerry Burelle in Sierraville just to ask him about the round cake of wax he had rubbed onto the long-boards that day . He took me into a workshop aromatic with chunks of early-day ski wax . " Making ski dope ' was a fine science a hundred years ago in the Sierra , " he said . " Those old-time ski riders had as many as twenty different secret recipes to match any kind of snow , and they would have shot anyone who tried to pirate them . " When I asked to see the recipe he had used that day , he reluctantly opened a book with a worn black leather cover and turned to a page of spidery handwriting : February 28 , 1895-No. 20 2 oz spermaceti 20 drops oil of spruce 18 drops oil of cedar 10 drops coal oil 10 drops oil of hemlock 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we talked about the Lost Sierra ? its crumbling gold camps , and its heritage of strength and kindness , the helping hand of good neighbors in times of trouble . " Nobody has much money up here , " said Jerry , " but they 're not afraid of work , and they can always find an excuse for a good time . They know how to enjoy life . I hate to see it all die , but dying it is . What a great thing that it has lasted this long . "
