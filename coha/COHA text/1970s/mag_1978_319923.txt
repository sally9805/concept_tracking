New Yorkers may or may not be the most discerning newspaper readers in the country , but they are certainly the most critical . During the long newspaper strike , which now seems to be winding to an end , they 've had to relax their critical standards and make do with a passel of skimpy strike-born newspapers . " New Yorkers are now getting . Clay Felker , the editor of Esquire , remarked the otter day , " the level of newspapers the rest of the country gets . This remark is unfair to a number of newspapers in other American cities , but not to all . <P> Who could imagine that two Popes in a row could be installed and Camp David take place without benefit of coverage and comment from the New York Times ? Those who have had to get their daily news mostly from TV missed a lot of valuable insights , but were spared much of the repetitious babble and striving for novelty that accompany big events They also missed some zero-sum punditry-someone must win , someone must lose-of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligently weigh their advantages and conclude that agreement was in their mutual interest . ( Or , as a Joseph Kraft column demanded right after Camp David , " Who caved ? " ) <P> Times readers , beneft of its acres of information and its sober ruminations , have n't got much help from the return to publication of Rupert Murdoch 's go-it-alone New York Post , which is crammed with ads , some news , and a lot of sell-promotion . Murdoch is too commercially astute to try to fill the gap left by the Times ( he could n't anyway ) . Instead , while he has the spotlight he has been trying to start up a new Sunday paper and a salty new morning tabloid to compete against the New York Daily News . <P> The city 's retail stores have done unexpectedly well . Of more concern to New York 's cultural role is the strike 's damage to first novels , unheralded plays , art openings and musical debuts , all dependent on favorable attention . <P> Other forms of journalism have proved ineffectual substitutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without improving them . Critics from the papers , reading their reviews on the air , soon found themselves simplifying their judgments-more fervently denouncing or plugging a book-having discovered television 's inpatience with verbal nuances . Reporters and columnists working for the strike-born papers seem less impressive than usual . Can it be that the role of editors in making news judgments is more crucial than writers like to admit ? Or perhaps , on interim papers , reporters are like football players in a postseason Hula Bowl . <P> As the long strike wears on , the public seems to feel less of a need for news . It has found other things to do , other things to read . Michael O'Neill , the wryly cheerful editor of the Daily News , acknowledges a cultural shock in himself : he feels uncomfortably out of touch with the city . The mayor greets him and says , " Is anything happening ? and asks nervously , " How am I doing ? "                  @ @ @
