txt Angus Phillips , 25 , is assistant , national news editor of the Washington Star . Ile was observing the demonstrations when he was arrested . BY ANGUS PHILLIPS Co 1971 by the Washington Marl WASHINGTON , M a y 4 ? I spent 20 hours yesterday as a guest of the District of Columbia government and they charged me 50 cents an hour for the privilege . I was arrested at the height of yesterday 's trashing and blockading in Georgetown . I was not told I was arrested until hours later . I. was an observer . I committed no crime . A lawyer in the compound I was assigned to put it this way : " They keep coning to me and staking , ' How long can they keep us here like this ? ' I do n't know what to tell them . If anybody were following the rules , they would n't be here at all . " In the Wrong Place The lawyer was there because he , and apparently a substantial number of others like him , Including me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . There were about 1,500 of us locked In ' a tiny yard at the D. C. jail all afternoon and most of the night . I finally was shifted to a crowded jail cell in the far northeast at midnight . Hundreds were vowing to stay on and refusing to be booked at the jail . Judging from what the prisoners had to say , there were plenty of legitimate arrests yesterday a n d there were plenty of bad ones , A 57-year-old woman who spends her days working for an outfit called For Love of Children said she had been seized when she had asked a policeman why he was arresing youngsters handing out leaflets . A George Washington University law professor said he had been standing on the steps of a university building wearing a " legal observer " armband when a policeman said the professor had bumped him . Seconds later he was in the paddy wagon . That is not to say that all the people were in on bad raps . Most said they were revolutionaries and had participated in May Day activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said they had not been doing ' anything , illegal when they were arrested . Guess 20 Per Sent Indecent One revolutionary , talking about the day over cold franks and beans in the breezy compound , guessed that 80 per cent of the people inside were " May Day types " and 20 per cent wore innocents . Well over half , he figured , had been arrested while they , at the moment , were acting legally . I was arrested for nothing at all . In fact , I was n't even told I was arrested until I was being booked . At about 9 a. m. a friend and I decided , since both of us live in Georgetown , to see what all the hubbub was about . The stench of tear gas was In the air a n d the sirens were screeching . Both of us felt confident about going out because we had covered riots as reporters . We made our way toward the action , stopping to snap pictures of the troops moving in and some sparring with the demonstrators . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went toward them . Walk Into Ambush ' But we walked right into an ambush . The buses were , in fact , prisoner buses just waiting to be filled . Being young , , we wore prime filler material . I think I was the first one grabbed . A policeman with a gas mask on walked up and said , " step over here . " He was carrying a hefty piece of oak and I felt no urge to argue . He put me up against one of the buses and searched all my pockets . He did not ask my name or occupation . He did not tell me I was arrested . My friend and I were then helped onto the bus . We were told by a policeman in the bus that we were being detained . Warning on Gas Once the bus , was filled , there was a bit of waiting around , a lot of turning around and a number of threats about the possibility of being " busgassed " if we chanted . The police put gas masks on and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20 hours later , $20 poorer , cold , dejected , frustrated , still uncertain of our legal status and very , very unhappy . We had spent 14 flours in the yard at the jail , about six of them without knowing what we were there for , and four hours in 5-by-8-toot cells with a toilet and a bunk , 10 persons to a cell . We sat thru two meals there frustrated b y repeated assurances that something ? lawyers , court ruling , bail money  --  was going on outside . Opinions All Vary The prisoners were almost always in disagreement . Some wanted to let the Army in to set up tents , others said no . Some wanted to eat and some chose to fast . Some wanted to submit to booking but most refused . I followed my lawyer friend 's advice and had myself booked . It was then that I learned officially that I was under arrest for disorderly conduct . I could n't have cared less . About midnight they herded 00 of us who had been booked into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 14th Precinct . They told us we would be released immediately on $10 collateral . No such luck . They released us immediately into the 5-by-8 cells and let us sit for four hours . Then they lel us go . And if you think I 'm not radicalized
