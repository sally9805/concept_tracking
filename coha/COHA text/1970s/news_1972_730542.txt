txt John N. Happy Camp , a shareholder in a small drug company , gets irritated when the government takes action that stunts the company 's growth . But unlike most disappointed investors , he does n't just sit back and stew . Instead , Mr. Camp arranges appointments for company executives at the Food and Drug Administration , invites agency officials to his office for long discussions and , when necessary , he even gets in to see FDA Commissioner Charles C. Edwards . Mr. Camp enjoys easy access to government regulators because he is more than just a shareholder trying to help R-P Co. of Tulsa gain approval for what could be a highly profitable drug to deal with venereal disease . He is also a member of Congress , and his intercession on behalf of a company in which he holds a financial stake involves him in what seems to be a clear conflict of interest : the use of public office for private benefit . Republican Camp was an incorporator of R-P Co. in 1964 . He acted as its treasurer before his election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He continues to serve on the company 's six-man board of directors . Together with immediate members of his family , he owns about 7,000 of the 600,000 or so shares of company stock , and the value of these holdings hinges on obtaining FDA clearance to market a drug known as Proganasyl , the company 's sole product . In such circumstances a circumspect Representative or Senator stands aside , because intervention for the company with the FDA could be deemed not only a breach of congressional ethics but also a violation of law . As the House Ethics Committee warned in 1970 , a Congressman risks conviction for criminal conduct if he benefits financially from " services rendered " in connection with any matter pending before a federal agency . " I Do n't Look on It That Way " Nonetheless , Congressman Camp is " working very hard , " says company president W. E. Botz  --  in effect to influence a government agency for the benefit of shareholder Camp . Yet the genial lawmaker ( he obtained a court order legalizing " Happy " so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised that his efforts to " sell " the FDA on the virtues of his company 's drug could be considered improper . " Oh , no , I do n't look at it that way at all , " Rep. Camp says , affirming that his motive is the protection of public health , not the promotion of private interests . The Congressman wo n't say how much he paid for the R-P Co. stock . But he contends , " I 'm not particularly worried about my investment , and I have n't tried to bring pressure on anybody down at Food and Drug . I would n't do that whether I had money in the company or not . It is n't right . The only thing I 've done is what anyone else in Washington would do , and that is make an appointment for ( company ) people who are handling it . " Right now , Rep. Camp 's investment is n't worth much , mostly because the FDA does n't share his enthusiasm for Proganasyl . The agency not only refuses to approve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year on 324 prostitutes working in Nevada 's legal brothels were considered inconclusive ) but also is threatening to remove it from the market as a prescription for vaginal infections generally . So , from a high of $18 a share half a dozen years ago , the unlisted company 's stock has skidded to " maybe a dollar or two , if anybody wants to take a flyer , " says Rep. Camp . A Productive Meeting Actually , the rarely traded shares must be worth less than the Congressman supposes , or else he 's violating a House ethics rule requiring Representatives to identify ownership interest in concerns substantially affected by federal regulation if their investment exceeds 65,000 in any one instance . Rep. Camp did n't list his ownership of R-P stock on any of three annual reports filed with the Ethics Committee since he came to Congress in 1969 . In any case , the committee 's mild policing has n't deterred his intervention at the FDA . Congressman Camp 's intervention for shareholder-director Camp 's drug company dates back at least to the summer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaginal Oil is a " new drug " ; the safety and efficacy of such a product must be proven or it will be yanked off the market . Joanne Southard , Rep. Camp 's administrative assistant , spent much of July 15 last year on the telephone , summoning FDA officials to a meeting on Capitol Hill . " Mrs. Southard said that Congressman Camp wants all those in the Food and Drug Administration involved in the finding that Proganasyl is a new drug to be present , " an agency memorandum records . On July 28 , 1971 , Dr. William J. Evans of the FDA 's Office of Compliance and Dr. Mar .. vin Seife of its Office of Scientific Evaluation met with Rep. Camp , company president Botz , director Ray Coward , L. H. Collins , president of Amerex Laboratories of San Antonio , which distributes Proganasyl under a licensing agreement with R-P Co. , and a staff man representing GOP Sen. John Tower of Texas . The meeting was somewhat productive for the company . Afterwards , FDA headquarters disapproved a recommendation by its Dallas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being marketed . One stated reason for disapproval was the " continuing dialogue between the FDA and Amerex Laboratories . " But in February 1972 , the FDA rejected the company 's New Drug Application as deficient on six counts , and in March the agency again pondered steps to seize the drug . " Because the firm continues to market the drug without an approved NDA it appears that legal action would again be indicated , " a staff memo to Commissioner Edwards stated . " Another factor involved is that one of the people interested in the company is John N. Happy Camp , Congressman from the Sixth District of Oklahoma , " the memo added . " I 'm Sure You Understand " When lower-level discussions failed , Rep. Camp sought a meeting with a reluctant Dr. Edwards . " I 'm sure you understand the policy I have adopted not to discuss compliance matters with interested parties without participation of those staff members who have been involved , " the commissioner replied in June this year , declining to meet privately with the Congressman . Apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his staff arranged just such a meeting in September . Dr. Edwards promptly canceled it . If the FDA were to act favorably afterwards , he explained more tartly this time , " the allegation could be made that the basis for FDA 's decision was a private meeting in your office with members of the firm involved . " That , he said , would jeopardize the agency 's integrity . Dr. Edwards ' letter is about as close as any bureaucrat ever gets to telling a member of Congress that further representations are n't welcome . But Rep. Camp bears him no ill will . " We 've struck up quite a friendship , " he says . " His old football and basketball coach up in Nebraska has been a very close personal friend of mine . " Sunburn and Poison Ivy And on Sept. 26 the Congressman accompanied financial and marketing executives of R-P CO. to a meeting in Dr. Edwards ' office ; the wary commissioner assembled five subordinates to hear Rep. Camp out . Mostly the Oklahoman spun tales about the wondrous qualities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieving such other discomforts as mosquito bites and scratches . The drug did a " tremendous job " in relieving Mrs. Camp 's sunburn pain , he claims , and " I 've got a sonin-law who had a brother who swore up and down that it cured his poison ivy . " ( At one time R-P Co. marketed Proganasyl as an antihemorrhoid preparation under the label ProAnal . ) On Oct. 4 the Congressman met with Dr. Edwards again , " reiterating , his arguments about the value of the drug , " according to an agency " memorandum of conference , " but never volunteering his financial interest in R-P Co . Rep. Camp did n't succeed in convincing Dr. Edwards . Yet his enthusiasm for Proganasyl remains undiminished , and he intends to keep lobbying ; company president Botz says another meeting is scheduled shortly . " If we do n't get FDA sold on it , why one of these big drug companies will come in and pick up that formula for sure , " the lawmaker-investor confides . " Somewhere , someplace down the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
