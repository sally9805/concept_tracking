The teak-colored woman in the red blouse with the large buttons and the expansive red belt was the television man 's on-the-spot celebrity guest , and despite her size and the babel around the stadium locker-room door she was a model of conscientious neatness and calm . As the mother of some 18 feet and 737 pounds of Oklahoma defense she was being pressed for revelations by the television man . // Yes , said Mrs. Lucious ( Jessie ) Selmon Sr. , she was very proud of her baby boys , Lucious , Dewey and LeRoy . Yes , she knew they were respected and respectable , the pride and joy of Eufaula , Okla. ( pop . 2,500 ) where they had grown up in the lap of poverty , on a sharecropper 's farm , and taught " to be polite and treat everybody nice , " to " take the world as they find it , " and " not let anything excite them . " // Did she get excited herself , watching the boys trammel opponents week after week ? The television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selmon . " Very . " // " We had a camera on you during the game and you did n't look excited , " said the television man . // " Pictures ca n't see into the heart , " said Jessie Selmon , placing a calloused hand on her Oklahoma-red blouse . // That particular scene occurred a couple of weeks ago , but it is no less accurate today to say that if the world was taken as it was found by Lucious , Dewey and LeRoy Selmon it is not likely to be left that way . Pictures will show , for example , that the world of Iowa State 's football team was dumped on its axis last week by the Selmons and some other talented members of what used to be a justifiably unheralded Oklahoma defense . // Oklahoma won as expected , 34-17 , after trailing 17-7 , a temporary , albeit regular , malady the unbeaten Sooners seem to go through until the Selmons " establish a good body relationship " with the opposition , as Rod Shoate , their All-America linebacker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as Coach Barry Switzer puts it . Iowa State made one first down and a net 47 yards in the second half , and a freshman quarterback named Buddy Hardeman , who survived that stretch of purgatory , was heard to offer a now-familiar lament : " Every time I looked up I saw one of the Selmons. " // Which , of course , is not nearly as bad as being hit by one . // The Selmons are not hard to see , being the logistic middle of the Oklahoma line . Before a play they stand there , three abreast , looking , with their mother 's benevolent , impassive , slightly Oriental expression , like an alliance of shoguns on the wall of a besieged ( but impregnable ) city . Brother Lucious , the 5 ' 11 " , 236-pound middle guard , is flanked by 6 ' 1 " , 249-pound Brother Dewey on the left and 6 ' 2 " , 252-pound Brother LeRoy on the right . Lucious is a senior , Dewey and LeRoy sophomores . The brothers Selmon are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach , Larry Lacewell. // But then they get down and into the action , and it is here , when the abstraction becomes a practicality , that the forest trembles and an awed adversary like Darrell Royal of Texas says , " You 're three-fourths of the way there when you start with three Selmons . " Kansas State Coach Vince Gibson found them " close to being the three best defensive players I ever saw on one team , let alone the three best brothers . " // Gibson laughs ruefully at the recollection of his team 's recent expedition against the Selmons . " My , my , the size and the quickness of those three . Great players . And what makes it tougher is they are surrounded by other great players . Three Selmons lined up together , and right behind them an All-America linebacker Shoate . I never saw so many fine athletes on a defensive team . " Gibson 's Wildcats wound up on the rocks , 56-14 . Oklahoma , he said , was capable of beating anybody just as badly . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the NCAA in August as penalty for altering the transcript of Quarterback Kerry Jackson  --  who was himself suspended for a year  --  is still loaded with talent and , obviously , high purpose . If they could not go to bowl games , Switzer told the Sooners then , nobody said anything against going for the Big Eight Conference title , or the national championship . // To that end Switzer , in his first year as a head coach , thumbed his nose at all the clouds ( in September he even had his car stolen ) and whistled up the sun . His offense is typically Oklahoma Awesome : Steve Davis runs the Wishbone in a style not even Jackson could fault , and has exceptional receivers , most notably Tinker Owens , who broke open the Texas and Miami games with long touchdown receptions . Rubber-legged sophomore Halfback Joe Washington , who plays in silver shoes , and Fullback Waymon Clark , a burly junior-college transfer , continue to deliver . Washington ran for 136 yards and two touchdowns against Iowa State . Switzer says Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the freshly Selmonized Oklahoma defense that has made the grandest difference . Just two years ago the Oklahoma defense was the perfect catalyst for the Oklahoma offense . Its weekly impersonation of an open gate forced the offense to win games by such scores as 48-27 . Or lose 35-31. // " Now , " says Larry Lacewell , " there are days when people know we do play defense . " And nobody has enjoyed it more than Lacewell . Oklahoma fans pay $30 for a black and white picture of him and the defense , and he is asked around to lecture . " Three years ago I was a mediocre defensive coach , " Lacewell smiles . " Now I 'm a defensive genius . " How do you get to be a defensive genius ? Lacewell asks himself . You drive 90 miles to Eufaula and sign Lucious Selmon to a scholarship , he answers . // It was not exactly an epiphany , Lacewell admits . " The fact is , I was n't impressed . Lucious was a 5 ' 10 " , 220-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already bigger than he was . The day I arrived he was sweeping out the halls of the high school . I asked him when we could talk . He said that afternoon , at the junior high . ' What do you do there ? ' ' Sweep that out , too , ' he said . Lucious and his brothers were janitoring before school , at noon and after school , earning money for the family . // " No one up till then had offered him a scholarship . And we did n't need a janitor . But when I got to know more about him , I began to warm to the idea that he had to be a prospect for something . " // What Lacewell got to know more about  --  and , ultimately , to appreciate  --  was the slightly incredible , totally wonderful Selmon family . Nine children raised in a tiny frame farmhouse west of Eufaula , in rooms no bigger than hotel closets . Without indoor plumbing , or even hot water until recently . // But Lacewell says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now the mark of the brothers ' athletic dormitory rooms at Oklahoma  --  with little gardens of zinnias and petunias painstakingly groomed . Recently , when an ABC-TV camera crew wanted to photograph the Selmons at home , Mrs. Selmon made them wait . " I have to cut the grass first , " Lucious explained . // Lucious Sr. , now retired after a series of debilitating illnesses , was father to a home charged with familial devotion and self-respect . ( Lucious Jr . makes this point so that " Mama does n't get all the publicity . " ) To the townspeople of Eufaula , the Selmons are beloved . They speak of their good citizenship ( " None of my nine children ever saw the inside of a jail , " says Jessie Selmon , " and when it came 9 o'clock I always knew where they were . They were home " ) . They speak , too , in Eufaula of the Selmons ' devotion to church and school . Lacewell recalls that the tiny television set in the living room was always dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we studied , " says Lucious. // Though wretchedly poor , the Selmons always paid their bills , and suffered the inconveniences of poverty . Without a tractor , the boys plowed with a harrow behind the family horse . Lucious , 2 ? years older than Dewey , who is 11 months older than LeRoy , grew uncommonly strong . He could carry a 150-pound hog under one arm . " But I was no match for Mama , " he says . " She caught me bringing in a can of beer one night and made me pour it into the hog slop . " Lucious is now old enough to enjoy an occasional orange blossom cocktail , but he has not forgotten that the hogs once beat him out of a beer . // Lucious was the first Selmon to be exposed to football . He taught Dewey and LeRoy the game with a tin can in the side yard , and took them on , one-on-two . " He always won , " says Jessie , " until we found out he was making up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme  --  but none recalls ever engaging in a serious fight , or even a falling-out . " It was unthinkable , " says Lucious . " It would be degrading to Mama and Daddy . " // Ultimately , Larry Lacewell had to out-talk Colorado Coach Eddie Crowder for Lucious , but he suspected all along he had the inside track . When Lucious signed , Jessie Selmon admonished Lacewell with this : " You 're recruiting my boy as a football player , but I 'm sending him to Oklahoma to get an education . He wo n't be a football player forever . " It was inevitable that Dewey and LeRoy would follow Lucious to Norman . Mama wanted it . But they accepted Crowder 's invitation to have a look at Colorado anyway . For the plane ride . // The brothers Selmon , all of whom were running backs in high school , no longer dream of scoring touchdowns . Lucious said he 'd much rather be " the chaser than the chasee , " and Switzer obligingly surrounded his central jewel with Dewey and LeRoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them progressively  --  say , 97 , 98 and 99. // There was considerable doubt early in the year that they would all make first string together . LeRoy , who as a 17-year-old freshman had started against Texas in the Cotton Bowl , was stricken with pericarditis , an inflammation of the sac around the heart . It was feared that Dewey and Lucious suffered from the same condition and they too were hospitalized . But their tests proved negative . LeRoy made a swift , almost frantic , recovery , and by the third game he was back in the lineup with his two older brothers . // And Switzer found himself caught up in the continuing contretemps of comparison . Lucious , he said , was the more experienced , the steadying hand , and maybe the stronger . Therefore the best . But then , Dewey had the closest thing to a mean streak one could find among the Selmons . Clearly the most aggressive . He was the best . And yet , here was LeRoy , a growing boy already bigger than the others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody can block him .... " Switzer whistles softly over the prodigies he can see ahead for LeRoy. // In Eufaula , meanwhile , the townspeople eagerly await the latest dispatches on the brothers . At the J &amp; M Cafe they gather daily and compare notes . Max Silverman , a retired merchant , is one of them . Max plays dominoes and , at opportune times , can be found holding good cards at the irregular meeting of " The Book Review Club . " // Max goes way back . For a long time when the school kids of Eufaula were asked who the most famous Jew in history was , they would write " Max Silverman " instead of " Jesus Christ . " Max can remember former Eufaula athletes who went on to play football at Oklahoma . Such as the late Joe Golding in 1946 and L.A. Cowling in 1942. // Eufaula was an agricultural center then . But the big dam built in 1965 changed everything . The town is mostly for tourists now , coming in to fish and boat on the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people do n't remember that Max was a basketball star years ago and , in his unflagging support of local athletics , was once the only paid spectator at a high school game . // Max watched all the Selmon kids grow up and counseled most of them , and when he had his department store he extended the Selmon family credit . " They always paid me back , " he says . When LeRoy was born , the ninth Selmon child , Lucious Selmon told Max he did n't know how he would manage , the cost of living being what it was . // " Lucious , " said Max , " the thing you ought to do is quit having children . " // Which is what Lucious did . // And Barry Switzer says if he 'd known Max Silverman then he would have told him to please keep his big mouth shut .
