To his legions of supporters , he is avant-garde and brilliant . To his many detractors , he is pass and boring . Actually , Choreographer Maurice Bjart of the Brussels-based Ballet of the 20th Century is all of those things . Part iconoclast , part P.T. Barnum , part aesthetic bluffer , Bjart deliberately gears his creations not to the sophisticated superegos of the modern dance audience but to the sensation-seeking ids of the young generation and the leisure class . <P> His stated mission is messianic . He is out to reach a new and bigger audience-the neophytes who may not necessarily understand or appreciate ballet but have a thirst for it anyway . In this he has succeeded . Opting for stadiums and arenas rather than conventional ballet halls , he has become probably the most commercially successful choreographer alive . When his latest full-length ballet , Nijinsky , Clown of God , came to New York for a 19-performance run that will end this weekend , it seemed only appropriate that the locale should be the 4,000-seat Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In it his flair for the spectacular , the mod and the grotesque is overwhelming , in ways that admittedly may whelm some more than others . Equipped with enough stage runways for a good suburban airport , adorned ominously by the obligatory - or so it seems these days-cross of Calvary , Nijinsky is essentially an old-fashioned allegory play dolled up for the stoned age . Its recounting of the life of the great Russian dancer is set to a schizoid musical score ( electronics by Pierre Henry , schmalz by Tchaikovsky ) . To Bjart , Nijinsky is a cast of characters all by himself-artist , simpleton , genius , child of nature and clown of God . Nijinsky also went mad in his last years and thought he was Jesus . Drawing on that , Bjart goes on to pose Nijinsky as a symbol of Man . On that allegorical level , the ballet is a paean to love as the true expression of God . Nijinsky stands for all the simple , warm people who need to love and be loved . <P> Opposed to him is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for daring to marry Woman ( Suzanne Farrell ) . Diaghilev symbolizes a false God who is at once greedy , arrogant and possessive . If Bjart 's whole dramatic concept is embarrassingly commonplace , it obviously appealed to him as a chance to fashion the kind of mass ritual he likes best . <P> The lights go up on three scanty-panty circles of writhing male dancers . They then form a single circle of life , and voil it is genesis time . Nijinsky is given life and immediately departs for Diaghilev 's Ballet Russe , which represents earthly paradise . Thereafter , the graceful and the grotesque prance the stage in some of the longest , slowest processionals since Catherine de Medici introduced ballet spectacle to the court of France in the late 16th century . Nymphs , whores and clowns flutter merrily about . Morality figures of death and madness strut menacingly . The serpent , dressed in a red flapperesque wig and pelvis-pinching tights , snakes sneakily around her victims . Nijinsky ascends the cross for several minutes of agony , then descends to triumph over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
