Grim thoughts from the OECD <P> The increase in oil prices-approximately 60% since January-will send the developed nations into their worst economic slowdown since the first round of OPEC price gouging touched off the 1974-75 recession . So says the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in its semi-annual forecast covering 24 member nations of the industrial world . In the next twelve months , predicts the OECD , their economic growth will average 2% , down from 3.7% last year ; their inflation will rise from 7.9% to 10% ; and their unemployment may swell from 5.25% to 6% , a postwar record of 19 million people out of work in OECD countries . <P> The forecast found that the U.S. will have no growth at all . Elsewhere , performances will range from flat in Britain to a healthy 4.5% to 5% expansion in Japan . West Germany , Europe 's trusty " locomotive , " will slow to about 3% , while France will do well to reach 2.5% . Because of higher prices for oil , balance of payment deficits for the OECD countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined surpluses of the OPEC cartel will also double , to $70 billion . <P> The report warns that any tinkering with the economy-such as a tax cut in the U.S. or further increases in West German interest rates-will only make the situation worse , and it advises policymakers to sit tight . Their main priority , the OECD advises , should be to reduce oil imports . Says John Fay , head of the OECD 's economic department : " We have a long road of rather slow growth ahead of us.
