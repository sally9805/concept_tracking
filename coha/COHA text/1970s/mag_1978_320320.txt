In California , State Supreme Court justices can usually afford to sit high above the political fray . Once appointed by the Governor , they need face the voters only for a yes or no vote at the next gubernatorial election before serving a twelve-year term , and in the past that public endorsement has proved to be little more than a rubber stamp . <P> But this year is different . After only 18 months in office , Chief Justice Rose Bird , the first woman ever put on the California high court , is in danger of becoming the first justice ever voted off it . Last week the state G.O.P. came out against her as " a serious threat to the California courts " ; by November a coalition of Bird hunters will have spent upwards of $600,000 on a campaign to clip the judge 's wings . Late last week , Bird 's chances of hanging on improved somewhat when the State Supreme Court approved the constitutionality of Proposition 13 , the highly popular tax-cut measure . <P> Bird 's appointment was attacked from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime and the death penalty , and because she had no prior experience as a judge . ( Neither did Felix Frankfurter or Earl Warren before they sat on the U.S. Supreme Court , her defenders pointed out . ) " She has a very clear mind , a good heart and strong administrative legal skills , " said Governor Jerry Brown when he elevated Bird to the court from her prior post as head of the state 's agriculture and services agency . " She is vindictive , snaps back and is autocratic as she can be , " charges conservative State Senator Hubert Leon ( " Bill " ) Richardson , who launched the campaign to unseat her . Richardson accuses the judge of poor administration and using judicial appointments to consolidate her own political power . Off the record , a few of her colleagues on the court echo the last complaint . Of Bird 's practice of using lower court judges to fill temporary vacancies on the supreme court , one justice says : " There 's power building here , and it 's under the heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liberal background ( at 15 she campaigned for Adlai Stevenson ) , a graduate of Berkeley 's law school , Bird , 41 , is also under fire for her vote in a controversial rape case . A man who had raped a woman over a four-hour period , while holding a knife over her and inflicting minor lacerations , did not commit " great bodily injury , " ruled the court . The majority opinion was written by one of Bird 's temporary appointees , and Bird concurred , alienating law-and-order advocates and many feminists , her natural allies . <P> However unpopular her vote in the rape case , Bird maintained that she was doing no more than deferring to the meaning given great bodily injury by popularly elected lawmakers . " Personal repugnance toward these crimes can not be a legitimate basis for rewriting the statute as it was adopted by the legislature , " she wrote . Stanford Criminal Law Professor John Kaplan agrees : " Rape , in itself , should n't be bodily harm . I think that 's what the legislature meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
