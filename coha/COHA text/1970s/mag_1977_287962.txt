From Jimmy , with abrazos <P> Not since John F. Kennedy launched the Alliance for Progress in 1961 had Latin Americans seen anything quite like the attention they were getting from Washington last week . Even as representatives of the U.S. and Panama were striking an agreement for a new Canal treaty ( see THE NATION ) , the Carter Administration was busy trying to patch up frayed relations and win new friends elsewhere south of the border . <P> Five high-level emissaries were out spreading the gospel of good will . United Nations Ambassador Andrew Young toured seven island countries in the Caribbean , as well as Mexico , Costa Rica and Venezuela , on a twelve-day mission designed to signal increased U.S. concern for the long-neglected area . At the same time , Assistant Secretary of State Terence Todman and Patricia Derian , State 's Coordinator for Human Rights , set out on separate South American missions , while State Department Counselor Matthew Nimetz went to Mexico City .

Mexico welcomes that proposal but also wants better trade terms with the U.S. in order to help its economy and its severe unemployment problem . <P> <P> South America 's right-wing military regimes <P> Carter 's early forcefulness on the human rights issue drove six Latin countries - Argentina , Uruguay , Chile , El Salvador , Guatemala and Brazil-to reject U.S. military assistance rather than agree to prepare " report cards " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations from deteriorating further-without , however , backing off on human rights entirely . Thus Todman was to shore up relations with the continent 's right-wing military regimes , while Derian would press Carter 's human rights campaign with civic leaders and government officials . In what was seen as an important move to improve relations with Washington , Chile 's President Augusto Pinochet announced late last week that he was disbanding the country 's notorious secret police agency , DINA . The action came shortly after Todman arrived .
