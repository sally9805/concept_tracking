While controversy swirls around the conduct of a few former prisoners of war , the vast majority of the 680 returned P.O.W.s continue to settle into the routine of free life . For most , the past three months have been a difficult time of readjustment and reacceptance . To find out what that period has been like , TIME Correspondent Philip Taubman repeatedly visited Air Force Lieut . Colonel Kenneth North and his family in Wellfteet , Mass . Taubman 's report : <P> At first , it is hard to tell that Ken North , now 43 , has been away for 6years in North Viet Nam . When Nancy , 14 , and Jodi , 15 , bring their report cards home from school , they sit expectantly next to their father as he examines the grades . Amy , 11 , tugs at Dad 's sleeve , pleading for permission to take her sunflower seedlings on the Norths ' Florida vacation " to see how they grow . " Before dinner . Cindy , at 17 the eldest of the four daughters , discusses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be too late , " she promises . <P> But just beyond the table talk and the girls ' tickling attacks on Ken , there is a world of rediscovery in this house , a father getting to know his wife and children , a family learning to be a family again . " The kids are going 90 m.p.h. and I 'm going ten , " says Ken . " It 's hard understanding a 17-year-old high school senior when you last knew her as a grade school child . " <P> The shocks of re-entry hit Ken every day . " We 've had dinner discussions when the girls used such vivid language that I was at a loss about how to clean it up , " he jokes . His eleven-year-old lectures him on Women 's Liberation . " She tells me how she is a person and has to be able to express herself , " he says in disbelief . In prison , he once took a vow that he would never let long-haired boys into his house . Now , he admits , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> The accommodation has to work both ways . Ken says , " I do n't want them to pity me , and I do n't want them to think ' Daddy 's home again and he 's going to crack the whip . ' I never want them to think ' Why does n't he go back to Viet Nam ? ' " When the girls once asked him whether he was tortured , he said " Yes , " and the family left it at that . <P> The comely housewife Ken left behind has helped organize P.O.W. wives , and she now is a selectwoman of her town . Before Ken 's return , she worried that she would be reluctant to give up the responsibilities she had taken on in his absence . Instead she finds she has " this tremendous sense of relief . There 's no longer a void to fill . " <P> Adjustments to the outside world have also been unsettling . When Ken takes the girls out for ice cream cones , he is likely to offer the cashier a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not in his favor : " That 's a buck thirty-five mister . " When North was in prison , he occasionally thought about the two homes he might own . " Now , " he says , " I 've discovered I ca n't afford those dreams and plans . Inflation has been so staggering I ca n't even equate my income with the cost of living and be confident I 'll have any money left at the end of the month . "
