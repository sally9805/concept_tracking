During his lifetime , United Auto Workers President Walter P. Reuther was regarded by many businessmen and rival union leaders as a dangerously disruptive force . Yet since his death two weeks ago in the fiery crash of a small chartered jet in Michigan , it has become increasingly clear that he was one of the healers that U.S. society sorely needs right now . Of all prominent labor leaders , he maintained the closest ties to the poor , the black and the young - those frustrated groups whose sense of alienation is fed by the suspicion that U.S. institutions , including big unions , care little for their aspirations . At the same time , Reuther kept the sort of control over his own union that many other labor leaders are losing in this potential Year of the Big Strike . The impact of his abrupt removal from the scene will be felt in the auto industry , the labor movement and throughout the nation . <P> Every Last Penny . Reuther helped to lead the 1963 civil rights march on Washington , spoke out almost alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly supported Cesar Chavez 's grape strikers . He bubbled with social ideas : for a national medical-insurance plan and for a program to build low-cost housing for the poor , using assembly-line techniques . At the end of his life , he was talking about adding some form of pollution control to the demands that the U.A.W. will serve on the auto companies when bargaining begins this summer . Not all his enthusiasms bore fruit , but the respect that they won is illustrated by the list of eulogists at the memorial services for Reuther and his wife . They included Michigan 's Senator Philip Hart , a leading spokesman for consumerism ; Sam Brown , the Viet Nam Moratorium organizer ; John Gardner , chairman of the National Urban Coalition ; and Mrs. Martin Luther King . Probably no other labor leader could have drawn a similar lineup . <P> Many of the U.A.W. 's 1,600,000 members were unenthusiastic about Reuther 's wide-ranging social ideas , but they trusted him completely to squeeze out the last possible penny in bargaining . He had little trouble convincing the rank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his 24 years as U.A.W. president , he made many bargaining breakthroughs that once seemed radical but have since become commonplace : long-term contracts , company-paid pensions , cost-of-living escalators , supplementary benefits for laid-off workers , a form of guaranteed annual income . Auto workers ' wages rose from the 850 an hour that Reuther earned as a young tool-and-die maker in 1926 to an average of $4.03 now . His successor , with no such rec ord to call on , will be under far more rank-and-file pressure to prove that he is driving a hard bargain . <P> The U.A.W. 's 25-man executive board will make the choice this week , probably from among these leading candidates : <P> &gt; Leonard Woodcock , 59 , director of the union 's General Motors and aerospace departments , which include almost half of all U.A.W. members . Woodcock , a graying , spectacled intellectual who looks more like a college president than a unionist , already has begun some discreet politicking for the job among U.A.W. local presidents . He recently was felled by tuberculosis , but has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
