One man 's endangered species is another man 's backyard pest . That modern-age anomaly is the crux of a dispute between the National Audubon Society and Louisiana 's Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wild Life . Arguing that a surplus of alligators was eating up such income-producing wildlife as muskrats and waterfowl , Louisiana reopened the swamplands in Cameron Parish to hunters last fall after an eight-year ban . In 13 days , 1,347 alligator hides were turned over to state authorities to be auctioned off to private businessmen . The Audubon Society , which long ago branched out from birds to the protection of all animals , promptly declared open season on Louisiana . Having praised the state in the past for its enlightened protection of gators , the society charged that even a short hunting season undermined public confidence in the federal endangered-species program . <P> Louisiana officials know that there is more than one way to skin a gator . Still determined to thin out the swamp population , they recently " offered " more than 2,000 of the reptiles to the Audubon Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plan to truck the alligators to refuges in other Southern states . In the bargain , Audubon officials also got some free advice from William Summerville , general curator of the Staten Island Zoo in New York City : " Keep their backs sprayed while they 're in the truck so they do n't dry out . Make sure they 're all the same size so they do n't eat each other , and keep them out of the sun . " Oh yes , and do n't look a gift gator in the mouth .
