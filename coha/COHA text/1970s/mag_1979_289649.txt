1979 awards continue U.S. domination of the sciences <P> They are the most prestigious prizes in the world . Besides a hefty stipend ( now $190,000 ) and a gold medal , they bring instant fame , flooding winners with speaking invitations , job offers , book contracts and honorary degrees . So heady is the honor that Physicist Tsung Dao Lee , who became a Nobel laureate at the precocious age of 31 , wondered what he could do for the rest of his life . Indeed , as the time of the announcements approaches each fall , many contenders are so afflicted with Nobel fever they literally jump whenever their telephones ring . <P> Last week the phones jangled for nine more winners , who , following the medicine award announced the previous week - to Allan Cormack , 55 ( U.S. ) , and Godfrey Hounsfield , 60 ( British ) - completed this year 's prize slate of eleven . The 1979 list of winners is notable for several reasons . For once , the often controversial Peace Prize went to an individual beyond criticism or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a selfless lifetime working in the slums of Calcutta . The prize for literature went to the Greek lyric poet Odysseus Elytis . The twin economics prizes went to men whose concern has been the problems of the developing world . <P> In one vital respect , this year 's winning roster was similar to those of previous years : it had , overall , a distinctly American cast . Continuing their domination of the Nobel science prizes , Americans took two out of three of the physics awards , and one each of the twin medicine , chemistry and economics honors . <P> Indeed , at a time when the U.S. is beset with economic woes , an energy crisis , weak leadership and growing self-doubt , Americans can take unalloyed pride in the honors that have been bestowed on its men and women of science . Since 1946 , 100 U.S. citizens have won Nobels in the sciences , more than half of the to tal number awarded and far more than America 's nearest rivals : Britain , with 34 ; Germany , 13 ; the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly as impressive in what Thomas Carlyle called the " dismal science . " Since the establishment of the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics in 1968 , Americans have carried off eight of the 17 medals awarded . In the most impressive U.S. Nobel coup , seven Americans made a clean sweep of the awards in 1976 , winning in economics , literature and all of the sciences ( no Peace Prize was awarded that year ) . <P> This week 's winners , in addition to Mother Teresa and Poet Elytis : <P> PHYSICS : Sheldon Glashow , 46 ( U.S. ) , Steven Weinberg , 46 ( U.S. ) , and Abdus Salam , 53 ( Pakistani ) , for their contributions to a theory that explains the relationship of two of nature 's basic forces : 1 ) electromagnetism , which accounts for such phenomena as sunlight and radio waves , and 2 ) the weak force that governs the release of a beta particle from the nucleus of an atom in a process called radioactive decay .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
