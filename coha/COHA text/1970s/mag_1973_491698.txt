Any old-time textile worker can tell you what Fuller 's earth is . A claylike substance used as a catalyst to thicken wool . In the process , Fuller 's earth gets rid of excess oils and other impurities which discolor the material . What remains is ready to become the warp and woof of a tight-knit fabric . Looming over the planet today is a similar resource . An earthy catalyst . A seeker of tight-knits . And a man who has done just about everything  --  including work in a textile mill . He is , of course , Richard Buckminstcr Fuller , better known as Bucky . Scientist , mathematician , structural engineer , ecologist , philosopher , poet  --  and all of them put together . At seventy-seven , he is one of the fastest-moving , most resilient figures of our age , and he has come to be revered  --  by statesmen , businessmen , and students  --  as a kind of savior . Dr. Martin Meyerson , President of the University of Pennsylvania , calls Fuller " one of the creative giants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologist , the humanist and the policy analyst can be combined in one man . " The late Ezra Pound wrote of him as " friend of the universe , bringer of happiness , liberator . " Indira Gandhi says , " He is a pathfinder in his obsession with the architecture of the universe . His innovations follow from his endeavor to understand what science and man can do to each other . He so clearly sees unity amidst specialization , that he can dismiss the pervasive feeling that technology is a toolroom of destruction . " In light of these comments , it is clear that Fuller 's greatest contribution is not the geodesic dome , although this spare , elegant structure  --  combining minimum materials and maximum strength  --  is his most famous invention in the public mind . His greatest contribution is the philosophical and mathematical system which the dome expresses  --  synergetics . And that system , evolved over forty years , pertains to the structure of nature 's processes , and to the structure of human relationships . They are , in Fuller 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talking endlessly ) , r traveling up to 200,000 miles a year , he says that man was born to be a success  --  as much a success as the hydrogen atom ; that man has distorted his technical advantages with inadequate attitudes ; that for the first time ( and maybe the last time ) man has a chance to bring his attitudes , strategies and ethics into alignment with universal law and actually build Kepler 's " cosmic harmonies " on earth . So anyone , however admiring , who thinks of Fuller as a dome salesman ( thousands , of all sizes , have been built under his patents ) is missing the point . The dome ( remember the U.S. Pavilion at the Montreal Expo 67 ) is not just a structural system . It is an ethical system . And the icon of a new philosophical age in which the technology of man will serve the intent of man , in which global strategies will be developed to serve his needs . In this spirit , the dome is a time ( maybe timeless ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about " ecology " has been condensed , and enshrined . Peter Ustinov got the message when he called the Montreal dome " Buckminster Cathedral "  - -  a statement of spirit , not just structure . Despite Fuller 's present stature as a revolutionary ( evolutionary would be more accurate ) , he comes off as quite a conservative gentleman ; and that , perhaps , is his strength . He is a short , dapper bundle of frequencies , almost always dressed in a navy-blue suit , white shirt and , usually , a New York Yacht Club tie . Other times , you will see him in a windbreaker , at the wheel of his sloop Intuition , which he sails most Augusts around his summer home at Bear Island , off the Maine coast in Penobscot Bay . Bear Island was really where Fuller 's " system " was launched . And it is , for anyone who has been there , one of the most cosmic spots in creation . From the time he was five , he has spent summers there with his family , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isstill skinny-dipping in the freezing water . Today , representatives of the militant left and the conservative right , of business and government , are liable to drop in , as are increasing numbers of writers and editors who know that Fuller is , in addition to being good counsel , good copy . Everyone , whether they go skinny-dipping or not , finds himself immediately immersed in an all-encompassing mind . The plunge is piercing ; complacencies and preconceptions are washed away ; Fuller leaves you , if gently , with an awareness of what you really know , and with the determination to organize that knowledge in some constructive direction . There is no place to hide on Bear Island . Especially from yourself . Years ago , Fuller decided that what you really counts , and that what you really know can only be what you really experience . He has never accepted anything secondhand and , for that reason , has been called the empirical pioneer of the century , His discoveries , his inventions  --  all are based on a sustained study of trends ; not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually have done , and are doing . He regards the universe as the aggregate of all experience , in all time . The universe is his minimum consideration . He regards single events and experiences as strands in a gently flapping sail , wafted by principles which interweave the strands . Sharing these principles is his minimum objective . " You are n't going to follow me unless you realize I talk comprehensive , " he 'll say . You sort of bristle with disbelief as he proceeds to tell you how he personally disbanded self-doubt and the torture of merely earning a living , and set out , in his words , to make sense , not money . " I 'm very used to something in science which says that if you get all your special cases together , some patterns begin to show up . You do something else with them . Then something else . All of a sudden , you 're liable to find something very fundamental running through it all . So met ping we call a generalized principle holding true in every case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to go as large as the universe and really get the fundamentals of what it is you are permitted to do by its laws . If you find out some of those things , you might really know something . " Fuller does . But , like most saviors , he endured a wilderness . First the wilderness was one of isolation . He was born in Milton , Massachusetts , just outside Boston , and came of good stock . The stock went back to the seventeenth century in America , and included celebrated theologians , jurists and writers , including Emerson 's friend Margaret Fuller , who founded The Dial . Through his mother 's family , he was as deeply rooted in the Midwest , directly descended from Colonel John Kinzie , one of Chicago 's founding fathers . Buck minster Fuller was meant to be " successful " but , frustrating family expectations , he set out to remake the word 's definition . For one thing , he was born so farsighted that he was practically blind . Until his fourth birthday , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mother made him play in an octagonal gazebo . It may be pushing it to say that its geometry influenced his penchant for non-rectilinear structures but , in this formative stage , there is no doubt that his preference for big patterns developed . At the age of four , he got glasses which , to this day , magnify his eyes to such an extent that it often seems he is looking through you , not at you . At this point , Fuller began looking through everything , His family took a steamship through the Great Lakes to Chicago  --  his love for navigation , for the sense of becoming , was born . About the same time , his maternal grandmother purchased Bear Island , where his actual experience as a sailor began . To this day , aboard Intuition , it and everyone else can be in a fog , but Fuller is able to pick out neighboring islands as they alternately appear and disappear in the soup , like so many generalized principles waiting to be recognized . It is not for nothing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with picking up several more honorary degrees ( now numbering twenty-nine ) . Four generations of male Fullers had been to venerable Harvard , and young Fuller , fresh out of Milton Academy , was to be no exception . Thing is , he could make no sense of the curriculum , and kidding around made more sense . The university did n't think so , of course , and expelled him . His family , not a little chagrined by his seeming love for trouble-making , decided that what money back he needed was some toughening up . So he was sent off to Quebec to work in a cotton mill , where he found the " curriculum " much more in keeping . There was machinery to assemble , notes to take , and he marveled at the processes of production . Soon he was back at Harvard on account of " good behavior , " but soon found himself more restless than ever . He has recalled how much the class-conscious ambiance perplexed him , and no number of distinguished New England ancestors seemed to make any difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupant of the Charles Eliot Norton Chair of Poetry there decades later , Fuller never took a degree . Had he been content to live up to academic ( and family ) expectations , no one would ever have heard of him and . given his sensitive mind , he would probably never have been able to live with himself . Out of Harvard , Fuller went hack to his boats and what he has called " my navy . " His navy was really the U.S. Navy , 1916 , and he was so good as a boatswain that he was recommended for special course work at Annapolis , where he excelled in electronics , chemistry and logistics . It was at this time , during the wat crunch , that Fuller began to realize what abundance . and distribution were . At the same time , he was acutely aware that material resources were being applied in every direction but that of human betterment . As in the half-century since . military advantage was not human advantage in terms of improving the living conditions or the options of ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical and tactical patterns of the military . Hejust wondered whether or not these same patterns would ever he available to create and sustain a peaceful , productive and cooperative world . Fuller stayed in the Navy until 1919 . Two years before , he had married Anne Hewlett , daughter of a prominent New York architect . She knew full well when she married him that this man was impatient to make a difference in the world . And she also knew that , while he enjoyed the elite social condition of the Architectural League and Long Island , this socializing , in many ways , bothered him . Throughout the years , Mrs. Fuller has been a quiet source of strength , a sounding board , a stenographer and , at times , a scapegoat-like many loyal wives . Benignly , she stuck . And the fact that she did so is a blessing . For the troubles came quickly . Their first daughter , Alexandra , born in 1918 , was afflicted with polio and spinal meningitis , and she suffered tremendously until het death in 1922 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , after that , for Armour &; Co . He was making about $50 a week , and most of that went to pay Alexandra 's nurses . Her death sent Fuller into an emotional tailspin which took him ten years to pull out of . He tried to recover by going into business with his father-in-law , who had developed a fibrous building block . Between 1922 and 1927 , he built 240 buildings , set up five factories , and invented the machinery that went into them . He also went the route of poker parties , drinking parties and , like so many of the rest of us , parroting everyone else 's views just to be " in " ? and just to forget . Inside , business success notwithstanding , he was being torn apart . The crunch point occurred in 1927 . Fuller had moved his family to Chicago to live , while supervising a factory in nearby Joliet . The block business was taken over by new owners , and Fuller was forced out . About the same time , a second daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up for grabs . " This precipitated my absolute determination to peel off , " he says . " 1 had kept pushing things , trying them out , and they always seemed to come to a dead end . I decided I 'd better call myself into account , with this new child to care for . Or get myself out of the way , because l was a mess . " The result was nearly two years of silence . Quite literally , Fuller shut up and started thinking about himself and his place in the web of life around him . He has said that he went back to thinking about all the things he had learned before trying to " get rich . " In many ways , he went back to being the child in the gazebo . Remembering those days , he says , " I told myself that if this was going to get anywhere , it would take fifty years and , unless I was willing to spend fifty years , do n't touch it . I was faced with the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways that 1 could try to help others without trespassing on them . I was not called a scientist , or architect , or anything . I was penniless , no credit , I was just me , and just trying to figure out what moves a little individual could make which might incite moves by other little individuals . The only thing really important about those days is , simply , that what I did to change course is in the potential of all human beings . am really an average individual ; in fact , I may be a little below average . " This moratorium led to his first invention  --  the Dymaxion House of 1928 . This " metallurgical pound cake , " as he called it , was a theoretical application of high-strength alloys and of the recycling of wastes for heat and light . Weighing three tons , selling at twenty-five cents a pound , fabricated in factories , deliverable in twenty-four hours , installed and serviced as a telephone would be , it would have been as much in reach of the average worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out . The Dymaxion House was not just a challenge to architecture in its appearance ; it was , basically , a challenge in its concept . Hexagonal in plan , cantilevered from a central mast , stayed to the ground with ca-bles , it was the antithesis of the heavy , overburdened architecture of the time  --  and , for that matter , our time . It expressed Fuller 's ethic of ephemeralization , of doing increasingly more with increasingly less  --  with the objective of eventually having more and more of everything . He has preached this ethic since . And in a world which has , on one hand , sanctioned scarcity and , on the other , abused abundance , ephemeralization is profoundly pertinent . Its application is an activity which Fuller has called " design science . " It assumes to improve the physical components of man 's environment instead of assuming to reform man himself . Fuller points out , " As a consequence of the extraordinary advances in technology during wartime , and during the post-World War 11 cold-war time , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrial network to 44 percent of the world 's total population . This acceleration has occurred despite the rapid increase in population , and concurrent with the continual decrease in the amount of metals per capita . This may only be accounted for by the increased ability of man to constantly do more with less , per given unit of resources , and per given function . " Although the architectural establishment generally disdained Fuller 's concept , letting it be known that architects would have nothing to do with " peas-in-a-pod-like " reproducible designs , many others did get the message . The House model was exhibited at restaurants , art shows and department stores . A Chicago Arts Club show in 1930 brought this comment from Inez Cunningham of the Chicago Evening Post : " Mr. Fuller had a dream of freeing women and children from the housing problem , but on account of his particular quality of intellect , the dream had to filter through the mind and so became a philosophy . There was the heart and the mind , but they had to be related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to the past , Mr. Fuller felt he had come to that state in our progress where mind must use matter , instead of matter using mind . This problem was not a problem for Boston or Detroit . It was not just a problem for 1930 . It was for humanity , in time . " Fuller and his family returned to New York late in 1929 . After the Chicago experience , he had plenty of things to say about the problems of humanity , in time . But the question was , who would listen ? His own family , and Anne 's , were tolerant , amused , and kept wondering how much money Fuller 's ideas would make , and how soon . First , there was Shelter magazine ( 1930 ) which explored how science might penetrate architecture . It had no regular editorial schedule , because Fuller refused to appease advertisers , and it was edited all over Manhattan , in various hotel rooms and friends ' apartments . Second , there was the Dymaxion Car ( 1933 ) , first conceived as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fuller was already a competent sailor and pilot , so it is not surprising that the Car looked more like something his friend Amelia Earhart would fly than something out of River Rouge . It had three wheels , including a rear one for steering . It had front traction , could reach 120 miles per hour , turn 180 degrees in its own length  --  and , one concession to Detroit , and a stock V-8 Ford engine . Only three were built . Third , there was the Dymaxion Bathroom , 1935 . Conceived in connection with research for the Pierce Foundation of the American Radiator Company , the Bathroom was five-foot square , consisting of four die-stamped elements . Mass-producible , delivered to a site for quick installation , only twelve prototypes were made due to pressure from the manufacturers of conventional plumbing . The 420-pound units were first built in copper , but were tooled for eventual production in aluminum and plastic . Like the refrigerator or stove , they were designed to be plugged in , and moved from house to house . Ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took them philosophically . But such distant relatives as the author John Marquand wrote , " On the rare occasions I have met him , there had been the same glitter in his eye which must have appeared in the eye of John the Baptist before he lost his head . He once told me that in his dream house , it will be unnecessary to worry about trivial duties . If your shirt is dirty , you simply open a slot in wall , throw it in , and out it comes three minutes later washed and dried . I asked him if it would come out ironed . He said no , but that it was silly to have an ironed shirt . lie has a great many brilliant ideas , any one of which should make him a fortune , but the trouble is the shirts never come out pressed . " Like Leonardo , with whom Fuller has often been compared , the task at hand was , oftentimes , little more than an excuse to think about lots else . Like Leonardo who , at several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or " patronage , " Fuller literally threw off his unironed shirts at the very point they might have been pressed and , to the world of business , presentable . But he knew that compromise is too often implicit in patronage . And he knew , also , that his concepts were far in advance of available technology . Trying to render , say , the House or the Bathroom in conventional materials would have been comparable , roughly , to rendering a DC-10 in adobe over wood latticework . So , during the 1930 's , as Fuller piled up inventions which might or might not get off the ground , he was , more importantly , accumulating insight and information about industrial trends , research and distribution patterns which , in the long run , proved powerful ammunition in his quest for " livingry " - for a liberated world in which all the essentials of life would be supplied , and in which the scourge of scarcity would enable greater self-fulfillment , greater participation , greater learning opportunities , to exist for all people . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by an inherent difference in human beings , that they are caused by differences in opportunity to express , to participate , to have a say , to fulfill . And he began talking about the " era of everybody . " As technical editor of Fortune , he supervised a special 1938 issue on American industrialization , and noted , " The historical fact referred to under the word industrialization is a great change in the life of the individual . The process has not been merely mechanical , but organic and evolutionary . It has created a new kind of life , augmented and hitherto unimaged . " Through his sustained , earnest study of events and experiences , Fuller began piecing together a comprehensive picture of mankind 's problems and potentials . He began developing what Norman Cousins not long ago described as " a remarkable capacity to look over his shoulder at the whole of the human procession , to see where it has been , where it 's going , where it gets its energy , what songs it marches to , what causes some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable the procession to reach its goals . " There is , of course , the question of whether mankind needs to know what is happening , or needs to look over the shoulder . According to Barbara Ward , other terrestrial species do not need to know . She says , " Instinctively , the animals move on when the grasses fail or the forests burn . Instinctively , they know where to hunt in summer or hibernate in winter . But they do not know or understand or forecast or control their habitat . If disasters strike , they may , like lemmings , simply surge to a collective death . " Fuller , many years in anticipation of Barbara Ward , was talking about the collective survival of mankind . And he was emphasizing that it is only anticipation and assessment , not instinct , which can insure survival . That is why he sought out trends running through varied events and experiences , those generalized principles he is always talking about . They are the benchmarks against which we must measure our moves if we are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spaceship Earth . " It is no coincidence that many of the statements , speeches and essays which came out of the recent Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment read like paraphrases of Fuller 's own teachings over the past several decades . Like many leading thinkers today , Fuller has urged that technology , of itself , not be blamed ; that , instead , we must turn technology around in thedirection of conscience and , beyond that , in the direction of more cohesive , thoughtful planning about the stewardship of our natural and human resources . He has not deified the machine ; he has created no myth around it . He has , before thousands of audiences , asserted that man 's mind is the key resource , and that man 's mind must measure and modulate man 's machine resources . In this , Fuller stands for reunification on every front ; the contingency he has always planned for is a state of peace and productivity ; and , in his planning and prophecy , he has foreseen a world in which human , social , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helping erode the barriers which have too long divided nations as well as those which have demoralized individuals . Fuller 's geodesic dome is , in this spirit , so much more than structure-it is a countenance of the generalized principles he has sought to share , It crystallized all the thinking which had gone on , largely in silence , during World War II when he was chief mechanical engineer for the Board of Economic Warfare , giving lectures about geopolitics to indoctrination classes . In March , 1943 , Life published a peculiar map projection he had worked out-the Airocean World . It received serious attention from scientists , and was accorded a patent . No wonder , for it was a real breakthrough on behalf of accuracy . The map eliminates all visible distortions of the relative shapes and sizes of land masses . In contrast to the regular maps hanging on your office wall , or in your child 's classroom , this one shows one world-island afloat in one world-ocean and offers , beyond accuracy , a more realistic sense of our place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new frame of reference for Fuller-the coordinate system upon which his Synergetic geometry would be based . The map was for him , and for us , a conceptual tool ( like his previous inventions ) , not just a curiosity item . And it was the genesis of the geodesic dome . The dome was the takeoff point of Fuller 's international reputation . From the late 1940 's on , he roamed from university to university-as one long-time friend put it , " a sort of wandering minstrel of quantum mechanics . " On campus after campus , his " young world " worked with his principles . And most of them realized that they were altering mental processes and attitudes in the process . One such student , the artist Sidney Budnick , remembers , " In those days , we wondered who had change to buy coffee and doughnuts . In Fuller 's classes , we pursued a scientific method toward structural form , and all manner of things ' came forth . Nothing we ' created ' was of much concern , for there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always there , just being together . Fuller is still faithful to the bond of love and understanding . Whatever his imaginative mind has produced , of all his wonderful toys or efficient structures , none are as tightly formed or economically stressed as the man he willed himself to be . " James Fitzgibbon , now Professor of Architecture at Washington University in St. Louis , recalls his impressions of Fuller from their days at Black Mountain College in North Carolina : " I had always been impressed with the depth and profundity of Fuller 's religious commitment , and there is a liturgy to his message ? this geometry . People could hear him , and go home to prepare toothpick and dried pea models of his structures . " The author Sam Rosenberg says , " He is a sort of Pied Piper of the intellect . He brings to the world of scientific ideas an order and cosmological view which previously had been found only in the supernatural . The reason that many students responded is that Fuller gave them a religion and an order they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying . " You can not understand Fuller 's significance today without understanding this aspect of his appeal . At present , his student audiences fill huge auditoriums  --  not just classrooms . He represents the spiritual undercurrent , as well as the social possibilities , of science . And he speaks to their longings for harmony in a world which is black and blue from bias . He can talk for fifteen minutes or , literally , fifteen hours . And he leaves you bewildered by the barrage but very much intent on getting it all together . A lot of people go away not believing a word he 's said , yet , somehow , comprehending the challenge . As Niels Bohr , the great Danish physicist , once observed , " The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement , But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth . " By creating mental connections and images , Fuller inspires keen interest in , simply , the idea of " think again , will you ? " He brings up points , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Johnny Appleseed , he deposits insights , knowing full well that some will take to seed , some not ; knowing full well that some will sprout conclusions many years hence . In a time when everyone is trying to find the right answers , Fuller has been reminding people that , first , we have to know the right questions , With no planetary plan , and few planetary priorities , mankind is doing a dangerous dance , shuffling between indecision and disaster . The coming out of China , the rapprochement with Russia  --  these too may go to seed unless nations undertake ways in which to help each other . While a handful of interests are benefitting directly from wheat and corn deals , millions continue to slide into oblivion at a time when the nations ' shared resources and expertise could create utopia . The alternative between utopia and oblivion is one which Fuller has tirelessly preached . With his eyeglasses on or off , it concerns him . And he has seen the wealth of nations diverted to slaughter , while the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without adequate shelter , food , health care and education . He has seen crisis after crisis . And he has seen an almost willful determination to ignore the causes . He has seen crime , and talked with criminals . He has also seen how much money and time are spent fighting crime instead of fighting for an environment where children are not merely born to live and die on cement . That is why Buckminster Fuller perseveres . And that is why he does so in a cosmic frame of reference . More than any single patent , or any single project , he stands for improving human interaction and understanding . " I know that man still has an option , " he says , " if he will become operative in the universe . All I have done is try to show men ways to improve their environment ; for , given the right tools , I believe man will reform himself . " He has not , contrary to popular belief , amassed a fortune ; any money he has ever made was plowed back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present schedule would be adequate compensation for most men  --  and an invitation to slow down . But Fuller will never slow down , and never settle for even the most winning rut . " The truth is completely spontaneous . Lies have to be taught , " he 'll say . And the feeling he generates everywhere opens up a spontaneous reception for what is just , honest and right . Books by and books about him are beginning to appear every few months . Newspaper and magazine articles every few weeks . While these repeat , with variations , so many of the same anecdotes and details of Fuller 's evolution , Fuller himself is , in his quiet moments aboard jets and in hotel rooms , already light-years ahead of the persona he has become . Besides , when a man has speeches scheduled well into 1974 , how can he slow down ? At the end of a recent stay-over in New York , Fuller was outside the hotel , refusing to let a bellman put his luggage in the taxi . In a series of determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were hasty bear-hugs and handshakes . And , last minute , a devoted deskman came rushing out with a publication for him to autograph . As the taxi careened off to Kennedy , t he desk man said , " 1 keep asking him when he 's going to rest , and he says when they put him six feet under . " Everyone present went off to their morning work , reassured that Bucky Fuller 's place is 30,000 feet up  --  or , as he would say , bristling , 30,000 feet our . " There is no up and down in the universe ! " One can only hope that the universe knows he is coming . Or , just perhaps , it 's known all along .
