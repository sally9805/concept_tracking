INSIDE THE COMPANY : CIA DIARY <P> by PHILIP AGEE 640 pages . Stonehill. $9.95 . <P> <P> The Rockefeller Commission report detailed its transgressions . Two congressional investigations are probing its involvement in assassination plots and domestic spying . The press keeps producing fresh disclosures . With all this going on , the CIA looks less like a clandestine fraternity and more like an open society . New sensations would seem impossible to find , and few , if any , are contained in the latest CIA expos by former Agent Philip Agee . His book , Inside the Company , is a sheaf of accusations and recollections that can no longer astonish a world grown familiar with the vagaries of secret services . Nevertheless , Agee 's tales are worth attention , less for their shock value than for the descriptions of a subterranean arena . <P> If ever the CIA recruited a candidate of uncompromising devotion , Agee seemed to be the man . When he joined " the Company " fresh out of Notre Dame in 1956 , the graduate experienced an epiphany atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Loyalty Day pageant , Agee claims to have sworn , " I 'll be a warrior against Communist subversive erosion of freedom and personal liberties around the world-a patriot dedicated to the preservation of my country and our way of life . " <P> Under the curious cover name of Jeremy S. Hodapp , Agee was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Quito , Ecuador , and then in Montevideo , Uruguay . Hodapp 's good works later made him aide to the U.S. ambassador in Mexico . As described by Agee , the CIA 's penetration of these South American nations was so thorough that it became a silent partner in the governments . Mexican authorities cooperated with the CIA to such an extent that the Company could tap 40 key telephone lines . <P> <P> Using agents to tap phones and penetrate the Ecuadorian Communist party , Agee &; Co. worked out an elaborate ruse to discredit a leftist named Antonio Flores Benitez . They concocted a report in the name of Flores , depicting him as a violent revolutionary . The paper was secreted in a tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then concealed the tube up his sleeve and let it fall out while examining Flores ' luggage . When the document was " discovered , " the ensuing uproar in the press helped discredit the government . <P> Comely Agent . A military junta took over , much to Agee 's satisfaction . Still he kept close tabs on the generals . The mistress of one of his agents was the official stenographer for Cabinet meetings ; Agee was privy to transcripts before the new governors . The CIA concentrated heavily on discovering the secrets of Cubans , Soviets and satellites . Agents installed eavesdropping bugs in apartments . Lip readers studied films taken of Soviet officials strolling in their embassy gardens . If the subtle approach failed , the Company happily played the role of pimp for overamorous Soviet officials . One was lured into bed by a comely agent , where his performance - said to be remarkable-was photographed and recorded for possible future use .
