Hardly had the fighting ended in Biafra when the world 's oilmen hustled in , checking damage to refineries , oil tanks and pipelines and preparing to tap wells that had been blocked off for 30 months . By early next month , drillers expect production to reach 780,000 bbl. a day . That would be enough to 1 ) supply all the needs of an industrial country the size of The Netherlands and the Union of South Africa combined , and 2 ) put Nigeria among the world 's top ten oil producers . <P> Oil fueled the Nigerian civil war . The major fields were in what was Biafra , and on them rested the region 's hopes of sustaining an independent economy . When the oilmen refused to pay revenues to the breakaway state , Biafran planes bombed rigs and installations . Biafran troops sabotaged pipelines and murdered an eleven-man Italian exploration crew . Nonetheless , except for one brief period when all of Nigeria 's 263 wells were idle , production never dropped below 300,000 bbl. a day - just over one-half the prewar output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling it to pay for the arms that finished off the Biafrans . For the oil companies the problem was , as one executive put it last week , " staying neutral while at the same time backing the winning side . " <P> Of the eleven companies that have interests in Nigeria , the best-placed is a combine of Shell-British Petroleum , which in 1967 was producing 500,000 bbl. a day . The company suffered the largest damage , and in 1969 spent $125 million in reconstruction . SAFRAP , the French state oil company , is probably in the shakiest position , since Paris backed the Biafrans with arms and cash . When SAFRAP tried to contribute money for relief , it was rebuffed by the Nigerian government . <P> The second largest producer is Gulf Oil , which is producing 200,000 bbl. a day offshore . Mobil , Italy 's AGIP , Texaco and Standard of California are moving rapidly to begin producing early this year . Most offshore operators anchor a ship next to their rigs to provide living quarters for the crew , equipment storage space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in demand for several reasons . It is low in pollution-producing sulfur , some 6,000 miles closer to Europe than Middle Eastern wells , and controlled by a stable government . Oilmen are confident that production will reach 2,000,000 bbl. a day by 1975 , enough to give the Nigerian government annual revenues of $1 billion , twice its present budget .
