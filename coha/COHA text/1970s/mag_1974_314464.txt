To many among the 10 million North American bird watchers , it was almost as if John James Audubon had been exposed as a forger or the American eagle reclassified as a turkey vulture . In fact , the American Ornithologists ' Union , the Vatican of bird watching , has come perilously close to such heresy . A pronunciamento in the A.O.U. magazine Auk stripped the Baltimore oriole of its name ; henceforth Icterus galbula will be known by the prosaic name " northern oriole . " A dozen other busted species include the European teal ( to green-winged teal ) , Audubon 's warbler and the myrtle warbler ( to yellow-rumped warbler ) , the red-shafted , yellow-shafted and gilded flicker ( to common flicker ) , the slate-colored junco ( to dark-eyed junco ) and the black-eared bushtit ( to common bushtit ) . <P> The reason for the taxonomic purge is that birds tend on occasion to be indiscreet in their mating habits . The Cape Sable sparrow and the dusky seaside sparrow , for example , have interbred ; Harlan 's hawks have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do not fit the A.O.U. 's official definition of a distinct species . As a result , the A.O.U. has punished the offending species by dropping them from birddom 's social register . <P> The new ruling has produced a flap among watchers , particularly those who aspire to the elite " 600 life list " of birders who have spent lives and fortunes spotting all the original 600 species on the A.O.U. list . As one infuriated enthusiast noted last week , " A lot of us people in the American Birding Association , which is made up of gung-ho list chasers as opposed to sedentary bathrobe birders , are fighting this . We 're going to make up our own list based on recognizable field markings , not on with whom the birds happen to mate . The Baltimore oriole lives ! "
