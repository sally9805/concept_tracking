" Since last summer , the President 's door has been open to New York officials and bankers , mayors , economists and others who pleaded their case . His position did not change , however . The President and his economic advisers argued that aid for the beleaguered city would constitute a breach of Federalstate relations and an invitation to municipal excesses : Precedent Feared aid one city and not others .
