LIBERTY 'S CHOSEN HOME <P> by ALAN LUPO <P> 330 pages . Little , Brown . $12.50 . <P> The question has become a shibboleth : Why has the North 's most violent resistance to integrated schools arisen in Boston , the place John Greenleaf Whittier called " Christian liberty 's chosen home " ? Alan Lupo , a onetime reporter ( the Baltimore Evening Sun , the Boston Globe ) and dogged historical researcher , provides some thoughtful answers . <P> Lupo writes out of sympathy and sadness for a city afflicted by tensions that stretch far beyond its precincts . Boston failed to cope peacefully with its school-busing crisis of 1974 in part because Boston had never been a unified city . It was schizophrenic : " A chic Boston , of specialty shops and bars and steak houses with hokey names " and " the old Boston , increasingly angry at the threats to its life-style and existence , convinced that somebody else was getting everything , while it was getting nothing more than the shaft . " Boston 's cursing , stone-throwing resistance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being hypocritical . " Instead , it was " a parochial city with a long history of ethnic and racial distrust and bigotry " integrating its schools with fear , anger and some violence-but with remarkably few deaths or serious injuries . <P> With a storyteller 's gift for narrative and vivid detail , Lupo enlivens the somewhat familiar history of poor , brawling Irish immigrants invading the Boston of the 1800s and suffering harassment from the threatened Yankees . He readily accepts Henry Adams ' description of the Puritan-descended New Englander , who " in his long struggle with a stingy or hostile universe , had learned also to love the pleasure of hating ; his joys were few . " <P> As the Yankees retreated to the suburbs , the Irish learned to organize the wards , seize power and dispense the meager benefits of city hall patronage . But in the interests of city growth and a progressive image , they yielded in the 1960s to wrecking-ball blitzes , which savaged homogeneous neighborhoods , displaced the poor and forged a distrust of city hall and all governments beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-integration plan ordered the busing of children between the city 's most antagonistic neighborhoods ( Irish Catholic South Boston and black Roxbury ) . It was resisted by every defiant or foot-dragging means possible by a Boston School Committee that exploited the town 's inherent bigotry and fear . Lupo contends that Mayor Kevin White , a progressive but hard-nosed political pro , saved Boston from chaos in 1974 by pleading , cajoling and threatening the city 's many factions-including its antibusing police-through wearying hours of public meetings , private coffee klatches , telephone calls and stormy sessions with top aides . White even assailed President Gerald Ford for expressing personal opposition to busing at the height of Boston 's agony . For all that , the mayor wound up sitting " alone on a bench on Boston Common with his head in his hands . He could no more hide his emotions from the city than it could from him .
