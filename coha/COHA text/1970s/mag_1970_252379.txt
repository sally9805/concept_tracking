" I 've been called a pig once too often , " said New York Supreme Court Justice John M. Murtagh last week . With that he recessed the pretrial hearings of 13 Black Panthers accused of plotting to blow up department stores , police stations and the New York Botanical Garden . Murtagh 's ire was understandable . For 13 days the defendants directed streams of verbal vitriol at the bench and the prosecuting attorneys , bringing courtroom proceedings to a virtual standstill . Murtagh 's solution : let the Panthers cool off in jail until they agree in writing to follow the traditional rules of courtroom decorum . He may have a long wait . <P> The shouts and curses and laughter of the Panthers are tactics of confrontation that were developed in the street . As the Chicago Seven ably demonstrated , determined men can disrupt a trial at will . And many defendants ' apparent disdain for punishment has rendered the traditional judicial fetters-contempt citations , gags and shackles-largely ineffective . <P> TV Trial .

Judge Julius Hoffman finally ordered Seale to jail to await trial alone . <P> Jurists are now pondering new ways to restrain unruly defendants without violating their constitutional rights . Judge Murtagh 's approach is simple but still may prove ineffective . Like Judge Hoffman in Chicago , Murtagh believes that the defendants will eventually play by the rules if they are punished enough . But the Panthers may well choose to remain in jail while they petition the federal courts for release on constitutional grounds . At the same time , lengthy incarceration will enhance their image as martyrs to judicial prejudice . That image is already well formed ; twelve of the 13 have been in jail since last April because they were unable to raise high bail . <P> To bring order to the court , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass isolation booths in which a defendant can hear the proceedings but not be heard himself . Such a booth was employed in the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann . But in that case the Israeli prosecutors used it to protect Eichmann from possible assassination-not as a muzzle . Even so , the booth smacks of suppression like the gag .
