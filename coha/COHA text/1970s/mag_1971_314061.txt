Faced with a desperate shortage of low-cost housing , New York City in 1965 began locating homeless families on welfare " temporarily " in hotels . What started as an emergency measure has burgeoned into a monstrous problem , a squalid way of life . Since January , 1969 , the number of welfare families housed in hotels throughout the city - many for periods of one year or longer - has risen from 262 to close to 1,120 , and their numbers are increasing at a rate of 10% a month . TIME Correspondents William Friedman and Robert Anson visited a number of such hotels in the city and found the conditions universally deplorable . Their report : <P> The signs of human decay are everywhere in the welfare hotels of New York ; they contaminate the very air . At the Hamilton Hotel on Manhattan 's West Side , junkies , prostitutes and gaunt young toughs haunt the vomit-stained hallways in search of a fix or their next mugging victim . Though classified as " temporary " by the Department of <P> Social Services , Mary White and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth floor of the Hamilton for two years . The apartment is a horror . In the bathroom , peeling paint drips leaking water from the toilet in the bathroom above ; a film of water containing feces gleams dully on the floor . Roaches and other bugs swarm over the walls , the bathtub and sink . A rotting pipe in the corner has a dual purpose : it doubles as the children 's " tree ; " because Mary is afraid to allow the children outside , the youngsters ' occasionally exercise by climbing the pipe when it is not too hot . <P> The remainder of the apartment is no better . Large gaping holes pattern the plaster , and broken windows are boarded over with plywood . The Whites have four single beds for the nine of them , and there are four chairs and a small table in the entrance way , where the family eats in two shifts . The kitchen is dim and terribly hot . Mary keeps the stove burning all day because the central heating rarely works . " The gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and the doctor says we 've got to keep the stove off . But if we did there would n't be no heat . " For Mary White 's two rooms , the City of New York pays the Hamilton Hotel $600 a month . <P> When the practice of placing emergency welfare cases-victims of fires , tenants of heatless buildings , or those who had been evicted for failing to pay rent-began five years ago , the average family 's stay before moving on to permanent quarters was 4 days . Then came urban renewal , which in the past three years succeeded admirably in clearing large tracts of slum dwellings ( 45,000 units in 1969 alone ) but failed woefully to put low-cost housing in their place . <P> Catastrophic Results . To add to the burden , an almost equal number of housing units-many of them tenements before the turn of the century-were abandoned by their owners . Last year , their number totaled 38,000 units . Consequently , the poor increasingly found themselves unable to obtain housing .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
