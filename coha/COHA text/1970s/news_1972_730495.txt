txt American relations with Eastern Europe are quietly but visibly moving into higher gear . Some of the movement was under way before President Nixon ' s visit to Moscow . But a clear spinoff of the summit with the Russians has been a growing effort of the Soviet-bloc countries to get on the bandwagon of detente . Moscow warmed up the atmosphere , in short , and the Czechoslovaks , Bulgarians , Poles , and others are gingerly but eagerly taking advantage of the thaw . Perhaps the most significant development is an overture from Czechoslovakia . Foreign Minister Bohuslav Chnoupek , in a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State William P. Rogers recently , indicated that his country would like to see forward action across the board , which could include such issues as consular arrangements and settlement of American claims arising from World War II and the Communist take-over . Trade at low level This looks to be something of a breakthrough , for relations with Prague since the Soviet invasion of 1968 , which the United States has repeatedly condemned , have been far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The possibilites of cultural exchange have been narrowed and contacts generally have been circumscribed . In view of the U.S. stand ? and Washington is still distressed about the continuing repressions in Czechoslovakia ? the Czechoslovaks apparently have realized that it is up to them to take the initiative if there is to be an improvement of relations . Bulgaria , a small country that is closely allied with its Soviet mentor , likewise has given its first sign that it wants a piece of the action . As a result of a recent meeting between Secretary Rogers and Sofia 's Foreign Minister , the two sides agreed that a Bulgarian delegation led by a deputy premier would visit the United States early next year . This would be the first such high-level visit since the war . Give-and-take proposition What the United States would like from the Bulgarians is the conclusion of a consular convention , which would facilitate travel and trade , as well as increased educational and cultural exchanges .

Since Mr. Nixon 's sally into Warsaw , the pace of bilateral activity , generated after a new Polish leadership came to power , has stepped up even more . Negotiations are under way for settlement of the claims of Americans who hold prewar Polish bonds . A science and technology agreement is expected to be signed this month . A U.S.-Polish Trade Commission has been set up . The Poles are also talking about the possibility of joint economic ventures , and licensing deals with American firms are growing . Agreement expected ? Relations with Hungary , too , are quietly improving . The two sides are now negotiating war-damage and naturalization claims totaling some $58 million . Mr. Rogers 's trip to Budapest last July gave impetus to these talks and an agreement is expected to be reached this fall . Assuming all goes well , the Hungarians will also make a high-level visit to the United States early next year . Romania and Yugoslavia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not of coursefit the same spinoff pattern . Possibly Romania is even concerned that Washington 's interest in it as a special political phenomenon may be diminished as a result of growing involvement with other East European countries . But the U.S. has been at pains to assure the Romanians that it views its relations with them as politically more significant and that it appreciates their independent position on some issues . Individual basis used In any event , it is not in Washington 's interest to try to undermine the Soviet sense of security in Eastern Europe , and it is dealing with each country on an individual basis within the broad framework of evolving detente in Europe generally . Presumably , each Soviet-bloc country , for its part , is acting with the clearance of the Kremlin , and the Russians are not upset by any of the recent developments .
