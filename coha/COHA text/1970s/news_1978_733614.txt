A22 Letters To Rid Lebanon of Alien Armies The Cost of Dying : 2 Cases in Point To the Editor : There are three foreign armies in Lebanon today  --  the P.L.O. , the Syrians and the Israelis . The Lebanese people want all of them out of their country and deserve the right of selfdetermination without the presence of foreign troops . A lasting solution of the crisis can only be achieved by expelling all these foreign troops and turning over control of all Lebanese territory to the Lebanese army . The troubles began with the establishment of P.L.O . military bases in Lebanon and effective control by the P.L.O . of certain areas in complete defiance of Lebanese sovereignty . The Syrians , Jordanians , Egyptians , Saudis and Iraqis , who are most vocal in paying lip service to the Palestinian cause , would not consider allowing the establishment of P.L.O . bases on their territory . The Lebanese people first sympathized with the Palestinians but turned against them when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . presence in their country . When tension between the Lebanese and the P.L.O . " state within a state " reached a crisis and erupted into civil war , the Syrians cynically exploited the situation by first supporting the P.L.O . and then turning against it with bruWhat Turkey Needs To the Editor : On Aug. 29 , 1977 , a timely cartoon by K. Metropoulos appeared in the Athenian afternoon daily Ta Nea ( The News ) . It shows Turkey as a patient , lying sick in bed with an ice pack on her head . Standing at the bedside , Uncle Sam listens to Turkey 's account of her ailments . The caption reads ( translation mine ) : " We are devastated by cholera . We have no doctor , and we have no medicine , heating or money . When are you going to send us weapons ? " With the recommendation of the Foreign Relations Committee to end the embargo on arms to Turkey , it is up to the Congress to see the issues clearly . Allow me to call attention to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military supplies really what Turkey needs right now ? And why ? The Administration feels that we need bases in Turkey . Is there no exchange possible other than weapons , perhaps to be used by Turkey in Cyprus again , or in the Aegean ? What certainty could the United States have that the Cyprus tragedy would not worsen , or that the Aegean would not become the ... scene of battle , both with farreaching consequences ? MIRIAM CASKEY Cincinnati , May 4 , 1978 Gangs ' in the Park To the Editor : Walking in Central Park this past Sunday , I was disturbed and saddened to realize the park has been taken over by great numbers of special-interest groups . Among the most offensive are the gangs of fast bicyclists , skateboarders and transistor-radio enthusiasts all tuned to the same station . On weekends , it is no longer possible to enjoy the park for its main asset : nature . Now , even here we must contend . with a mechanized society . GREGORY MARTINDALE New York , May 1 , 1978 Coastal Management : tal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp . This created a stalemate which could only be resolved by a so-called " Arab peacekeeping force , " which is in reality the Syrian army . The P.L.O . was pushed by the Syrians into the southern part of the country , where it harassed Christian villages , which turned to Israel for support . The Israeli attack on P.L.O . bases in Lebanon was a response not only to a wild act of terror in Israel but also to requests from Lebanese Christians to stop the continued murders of Lebanese civilians by the P.L.O . The Israeli incursion was in fact enthusiastically supported by the local Christian population . Any U.S. or U.N . resolution which calls for replacement of foreign troops by U.N . or Lebanese troops should be evenhanded and demand the withdrawal of all foreign troops . Taking sides on this issue and allowing any one of these armies to remain with extraterritorial rights in Lebanon will only produce further crises and will deny the fundamental right of selfdetermination to the Lebanese people . HARRY J. LIPKIN Professor of Physics The Weizmann Institute of Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chwast To Ask for a Job To the Editor : I recently had to apply for a summer job at the city 's Youth Employment Program . After Waiting for two wearisome hours in the Health Department Clinic for a physical examination , I was informed that I had to apply at the Job Placement Center first . It took me another Iwo exhausting hours to run to the Placement Center and return to the clinic . I was asked to wait , and after another tedious hour of patience , I was told that , because I came in late , the doctor could not waste his time on me . Therefore , I would have to lose another day of school in order to return . Whom do they think they 're fooling ? I think it 's about time we take affirmative action toward improving the city 's services to the public . We can begin by replacing the indolent employees with diligent people who know what they 're doing . VASILIOS S. GEORGIOU New York , April 28 , 1978 10 the Lanor : I read your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're calling themselves these days . Today I read in your letters columns a reply from the director of the New Jersey Funeral Directors ' Association , in which he set out to rebut some of your writer 's findings and to speak up for undertakers in general . One thing he wrote was , " Most people would say : ' My funeral director , he 's O.K. ' " By unhappy chance , I 've been involved in two funeral arrangements in the last two weeks . In the first , I watched a friend part with $1,200 to have his wife delivered to a crematory in a pine box in a station wagon . The funeral director showed him a kind of menu , and this choice of disposition was called " minimal . " He was n't in the mood to shop around , There was a sales tax . This week , my father-in-law died on a flight to Germany . It was a heart attack , not a crash . His hometown undertaker notified the family , and the American Consulate in Frankfurt confinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would have to send $4,500 . Options were offered : $1,700 for burial in Germany ; $1,200 for cremation . By some rules , someone wrote , it 's required that one funeral " home " over there deal with another funeral " home " over here . I called the airline to ask if it were possible that the family would have to pay $4,500 to receive their father 's body , and they said " yes . " I reached the cargo supervisor of the airline and asked how much they get for sending a body in a casket from Germany to New York . He said , " about $310 . " Who gets the rest ? I wondered how many people would have $4,500 to bring home a dead relative or friend . Then I wondered how many people realize that they might face this problem , so I 'm writing this . The office aides of two U.S. Senators and one Representative did n't know it , and people should know that , too . It seems - time to write some new rules for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made some inquiries before leaving , because of his frail health , and then left under the impression that there would be no problem since he had purchased a round-trip ticket ! Should n't an airline - that sells you a round-trip ticket be required to send you back , if dead , with some reasonable packaging charge ? DONALD REILLY Westport , Conn. , May 2 , 1978 Test ' the Death Penalty To the Editor : Governor Carey , of course , notes that a quite major percentage of his constituents fail to agree with his personal view on capital punishment . Would n't it then be fairer to them to conduct a test of capital punisment 's deterrent value by authorizing it for a specified trial period of , say , three years or five ? I should think that if , despite having somehow won through with the veto , he now volunteered such a plan , his public rating must rise dramatically , statewide and nationwide . The Governor 's assessment may turn out to be the accurate one , but at least let the survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with everyone meantime feeling just a shade more secure . LEE M. SCHOEI1 Darien , Conn. , May 3 , 1978 A Surprising Amount of Progress ' To the Editor : I applaud the April 25 article by Gladwin Hill ( " Effort to Preserve U.S. Coastline Lagging " ) and hope that it has acquainted more Americans with the fact that a major coastal-management effort is now under way in most of our coastal states and territories . Results have indeed been slow in coming , but not , in my opinion , because of any lagging in the effort . Rather , the pace is due to the inherent difficulty of the task . In fact , a surprising amount of progress has been made despite the presence of strongly vested interests that are generally resistant to change . The period since the passage of the Federal Coastal Act in 1972 has seen a sagging economy , the emergence of an energy crisis and growing discontent with government regulations , all of which have further complicated the problem . Since January 1969 , when the first major Government report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coastal states and territories have passed coastal or shoreline legislation . And that effort continues . At this moment , state legislatures as diverse as those in Delaware , Florida , Guam , Illinois , Louisiana and the Virgin Islands are debating coastal bills . And in a dozen states operational programs are now under way . In South Carolina , for example , for a mostly virgin Atlantic coastal area ripe for development , coastal legislation was signed into law last year after three years of sustained effort and two earlier unsuccessful attempts . For the first time , developments that affect sensitive coastal resources such as wetlands , beaches and dunes and intertidal areas are being controlled by a state permit system . Rhode Island , the " Ocean State , " enacted coastal management legislation in 1971 , prior to the Federal Act , but the progress on implementation was slow until Federal funds became available in 1974 . Since then , the program has been considerably broadened to address many more coastal issues , including the location of onshore support bases for offshore oil drilling . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been to enact entirely new pieces of state legislation and to create new agencies to administer state C.Z.M. programs . Many states have concluded , however , that while certain new legislation may be needed to put coastal policies in place or to deal with specific coastal issues , improving the The Times welcomes letters from readers . Letters for publication must include the writer 's name , address and telephone number . Because of the large volume of mail received , we regret that we are unable to acknowledge or to return unpublished letters . coordination and consistency between levels of government and making existing coastal laws and programs work more simply and effectively will go a long way toward improving the management of our coastal zones . Our shorelines and coastal waters are both beautiful and bountiful , We , and those who follow us , can enjoy this wealth forever or , through our carelessness , can lose it . Unfortunate , ly , ' major oil spills like the recent one along the coast of France are not the only way to degrade coastal resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private decisions on the use of our coasts can have an equivalent effect . That changing circumstances have made the task harder is not cause to despair but reason to redouble the effort . Given what is at stake , we can not afford to do less . ROBERT W. KNECHT Assistant Administrator , Coastal Zone Management , U.S. Dept. of Commerce Washington , April 27 , 1978
