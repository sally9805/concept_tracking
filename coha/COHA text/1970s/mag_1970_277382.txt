IT was not exactly an intimate rap session , as nearly 600 seamen , submariners and officers jammed a base theater at Pearl Harbor last week . But the pert WAVE spoke up boldly on behalf of two of her service friends with an unusual problem : " She works a day shift while her husband is on the night shift . Ca n't something be done ? " The officer directed her to leave their names , and since that officer was none other than Admiral Elmo ( " Bud " ) Zumwalt , Chief of Naval Operations and the U.S. Navy 's uniformed boss , the pair will soon be on more compatible assignments . <P> Similar scenes could be observed elsewhere in the U.S. armed services : <P> At Fort Benning , Ga. , it was 0600-reveille hour-but no bugle sounded . So SP/4C Terry Reed dozed blissfully until 7 a.m . Reveille has gone out of style at Fort Benning ; all a soldier need do is get to his first duty post on time . <P> Wearing dungarees and a flag-striped crash helmet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Charleston Naval Station , S.C. , by gunning his motorcycle up to the main gate . <P> On the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy in the Mediterranean , Captain Ferdinand B. Koch conducted an electronic forum via the ship 's closed-circuit TV , answering questions phoned to him from sailors below decks . <P> Those episodes are all part of a radical drive now under way in the U.S. armed forces to humanize military life . It was launched most effectively by the Navy , whose ships ' horns still bark , " Now hear this ! Now hear this ! " but whose officers more and more seem to be saying to men of all ranks : " We hear you ! We hear you ! " The movement was given further impetus last week by new directives from the Army and Air Force that seek to make life in the service more bearable and attractive . It aims to meet at least in part the demands of a brighter , more restive generation of young Americans who reject the artificiality of make-work chores and spit-and-polish regimen , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority . Each officer has his own definition of the new mood , and not all approve of the change . For one who does , Major General Bernard W. Rogers , commander of the Army 's 4th Infantry Division , it is simply to make everyone in his service " give a damn for the soldier . " <P> A Matter of Survival <P> The reform of military life is not a luxury or even merely an idea whose time has come , mirroring the changes in the rest of U.S. society . It is a necessity . Largely because of the Viet Nam War , the prestige of the military is plummeting . Many servicemen , including cadets and midshipmen from West Point and Annapolis , try to hide their military connections when on leave among their peers . There is even a wig market in Annapolis where middies can acquire hirsute camouflage . Re-enlistment rates have dropped to their lowest levels since 1955 . Barely 31% of servicemen of all ranks and branches now volunteer for a second term . <P> The mounting antimilitarism in the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must debate next year . Top Pentagon officials expect the vote to be extremely close . Until they have time to effect all the reforms that might make service more appealing , they consider Selective Service the only weapon they have to maintain adequate manpower .
