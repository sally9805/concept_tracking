One evening early in 1971 , as Author Gay Gaetano Galante Septimo Talese ( The Kingdom and the Power , Honor Thy Father ) was walking home from a Manhattan restaurant with his wife , he spotted a sign on a Lexington Avenue third-floor window : LIVE NUDE MODELS . That was when Talese , a lapsed Catholic of conventionally moralistic upbringing , suddenly realized that the sexual revolution had landed almost literally at his doorstep . Next day he walked back alone for his first massage-parlor massage . <P> That rubdown was inspiration-and the initial field research-for a projected 800-page magnum opus on sex , a work that Talese hoped would do for Eros what his earlier books had done for the New York Times and the Mafia . Instead , it has become perhaps the most famous unwritten volume in publishing history . Four years and a thousand orgasms later , not a word of Talese 's vast researches has appeared in print . <P> Not , that is , until now . This week Esquire will publish a 9,000-word chunk from Talese 's as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girlie photo , the man who has carried on a masturbatory affair with that picture since 1957 , and the California model who posed for it . Talese found the man , Harold Rubin , now 35 and a Chicago porn merchant , by wandering into his sex shop ; he eventually learned of his obsession and finally located the model , Diane Webber , now a Malibu , Calif. , housewife and belly-dance instructor . ( The two have never met . ) He interviewed the pair and their families more than a dozen times , and recounts the sexual histories of all in the smooth , detailed prose at which Talese excels . " I got people to talk because I care and I 'm interested , " he says . " I wanted to see how people get through their days and nights . " <P> One of the main characters of the book will be the self-described " participating observer " himself . Talese , now 43 and not visibly tired , will detail his experiences of managing two massage parlors at once ( " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the U.S. and Europe , sitting through porno films and sex-therapy sessions , frolicking in nudist camps , joining in group sex and otherwise living out the genitalian fantasies of millions-all in the name of journalism . " A writer can not write from the sidelines , " he says . " It 's my own life story . I 'm holding nothing back . " <P> Not that there would be that much left to hide . He has already been described in a nude health-spa romp in New York magazine ; Esquire has reported , among other brief encounters , his coupling with the ex-wife of a sex-magazine editor . Talese promises to tell in the book about his surprisingly tranquil domestic life . His wife Nan , a stunningly attractive senior editor at the Manhattan book publishing house of Simon <P> &; Schuster , married Talese in 1959 , when he was an obscure New York Times reporter . They live with their two daughters in an East Side townhouse . Nan has said she was pained at the descriptions of her husband 's infidelities , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they know something about us , " she says . " They don't. "
