We are coming out with a foreign-investment policy that is going to be the weakest of any industrialized nation 's . If I were an American , I would be amazed by the sweet reasonableness of it . <P> -A Canadian Cabinet Minister <P> When that long-awaited policy statement was finally released last week , U.S. investors were indeed pleasantly surprised . After two years of intense study by a task force under Canadian Revenue Minister Herbert Gray , the Ottawa government decided merely to " review " proposed takeovers of sizable Canadian companies by foreigners and to permit only those that seem likely to bring " significant benefit " to the country . <P> That was a modest response to the smoldering nationalist resentment against " domination " of the Canadian economy by U.S. business . The Canadian Cabinet had considered much tougher proposals , which would have given Ottawa control over the flow of investment to start plants in Canada or expand subsidiaries already operating there . But the Cabinet rejected those ideas . Executives of U.S. companies that have poured $28 billion into Canada-mostly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies-noted that the new policy will have no direct effect on their operations , or on the $1.8 billion in earnings that they bring back home each year . <P> Nationalists denounced the new policy as a " sellout , " " hoax " and " one big zero " and threatened to make it a hot issue in the forthcoming Canadian election campaign . Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau may well beat them because he has taken aim at an unpopular form of investment . Takeovers , mostly by U.S. firms , account for only 17% of the flow of foreign investment money into Canada , but they are especially noxious to many Canadians because they do nothing directly to expand production or jobs but only transfer ownership to outsiders . Whatever happens in the next election , it would be a grave mistake for U.S. executives to underestimate the deep worry that their operations north of the border cause among many Canadians . <P> U.S. companies own 99% of Canada 's oil refineries , 85% of its primary metal smelters , 84% of its rubber factories , 78% of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the transportation-equipment industry-indeed , 90% of all Canadian plants that employ 5,000 or more workers . Many a Canadian suburbanite begins his day by brushing his teeth with Crest , grabbing a cup of Maxwell House instant coffee , hopping into a Mustang and heading for work at , say , Du Pont of Canada Ltd . <P> U.S. investment has unquestionably enabled these industries to grow larger than they would have if they had been dependent solely on Canadian capital . In many a provincial town , U.S.-owned factories are almost the only source of employment and prosperity . Still , Canadians commonly complain that U.S. parent companies ( known in Canada as " American mothers " ) treat the country like one gigantic branch plant . The " mothers " are accused , for example , of concentrating research and development in the U.S. ; the percentage of Canadian gross national product devoted to R. and D. is among the lowest of industrialized nations .
