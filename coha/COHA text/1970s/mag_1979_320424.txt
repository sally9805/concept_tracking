Flight attendants cope with the trauma of fatal disasters <P> When a Southern Airways DC-9 crashed in rain and hail near New Hope , Ga. , in 1977 , Flight Attendant Sandy Purl was not among the 70 dead . But she came to wish she had been . Hospitalized and sedated for shock , Purl would leap from her bed each night shouting , " Grab your ankles ! " and try to force other patients into the classic precrash body position . A year later , she was still overcome with guilt that she had survived and her passengers died . One recurrent fantasy was that her arms and legs were gone . Says Purl : " I thought maybe if I had no legs or arms , I would be a victim of the crash and that would be O.K. I looked into the mirror one morning and beat it to splinters because I looked so good . My husband was absolutely supportive , but I divorced him . I woke up a year later and thought , ' My God , what have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postcrash syndrome among airline personnel : a deep trauma that combines survivor guilt , depression , rage and an array of physical symptoms ranging from digestive problems and hypertension to sleeplessness and heart ailments . Some survivors develop phobias or panic when they hear sounds that remind them of the crash , and many are so worn out by the continuing anguish that they say they are simply too tired to make even minor decisions about their lives . Says Psychiatric Sociologist Margaret Barbeau of Glendale , Calif. : " You can walk away from an accident without physical injury , but the emotional injury may be even worse . You ca n't X-ray it , but the injuries are real . " <P> Barbeau devotes much of her practice to treating airline personnel and families of the dead after fatal plane crashes . Hired by the Association of Flight Attendants , she conducts group sessions and keeps a phone line open night and day for troubled survivors . Reason : the victim 's obsessive need to talk about the ordeal is part of the healing process . Says Barbeau : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " <P> The first reaction of the survivor , says Barbeau , is " psychic numbing , " a defense mechanism that keeps him or her functioning . Then the full horror of the crash pokes through , fades again , and gradually comes to overwhelm the victim . Like many flight attendants , Arlene Feroe , who survived an Alaska Airlines accident , ran around the hospital for days apologizing to injured passengers . Another attendant drove his automobile into a tree during a hallucination ; he " saw " a colleague who died in a plane crash sitting beside him in the car . <P> Barbeau 's aim is to convert guilt and depression into rage and tears-to get the emotion out so that healing may begin .
