At last-the real truth about Watergate ! Richard Nixon had this unconscious " need to fail , " you see , which stemmed from guilt over his boyhood " sexual yearning for his mother . " The forbidden Oedipal urge required punishment , and with a man as competitive as Nixon , failure was the worst possible penalty . So Nixon punished himself by " arranging his own failures " and became " his own executioner . " <P> Or so concludes Manhattan Psychoanalyst David Abrahamsen in Nixon vs . Nixon : An Emotional Tragedy ( Farrar , Straus and Giroux , $10.95 ) , the latest entry in the burgeoning field known as " psychobiography . ' ' Psychobiographers seek to explain the lives of famous people by theorizing about their inner psyches . The best-known and most respected practitioner , Erik Erikson , subjected Luther and Gandhi to the treatment . Sigmund Freud once collaborated ( with William Bullitt ) on a job on Woodrow Wilson . By now psychobiography has become such a fad that last year an American Psychiatric Association task force recommended that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give their permission . <P> In Search . But some personalities are evidently too tantalizing to be resisted . Abrahamsen 's book follows others on the former President : M.I.T. Historian Bruce Mazlish 's In Search of Nixon and Duke Political Scientist James David Barber 's The Presidential Character . Abrahamsen , 73 , who was born in Norway and immigrated to the U.S. in 1940 , is an acknowledged expert on criminal behavior . He has also written two other psychobiographies , on a turn-of-the-century Viennese anti-Semite and on Lee Harvey Oswald . In preparing his Nixonalysis , Abrahamsen interviewed dozens of people , including several Nixon relatives ( but no members of his immediate family ) , onetime Colleagues Robert Finch and Roy Cohn , Watergate Prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste , and Alger Hiss . <P> Abrahamsen , however , has never met Richard Nixon , much less put him on the couch . That has not deterred him from making some sweeping generalizations in diagnosing Nixon 's alleged " emotional illness . " For much of his life , Abrahamsen argues , Nixon has been " totally lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anyone " and " incapable of making a firm commitment based on personal conviction . " ( The latter is fortunate , Abrahamsen says ; if the man had any strongly held ideals , he would have been much more dangerous . ) Abrahamsen fairly raids the professional lexicon of disorder in describing Nixon : he is variously tagged as obsessive-compulsive , self-hating , hysterical , masochistic , doubting of his masculinity and even psychopathic . <P> Some episodes of Nixon 's public career might support those descriptions , but Abrahamsen makes his mountains of childhood molehills . When Nixon was a boy , he would lie awake at night , listening to whistles of passing trains and fantasizing about faraway places . This wanderlust , which continued in adulthood , was an outlet for " frustrated sexual desires . " Young Nixon was also adept at mashing potatoes without leaving any lumps ; Abrahamsen writes that he " chose to release his energy " in this " unusual " way to win his mother 's love . The " extent and intensity " of the mashing suggests " aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
