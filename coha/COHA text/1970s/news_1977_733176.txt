txt After nearly 16 years of fighting , the war for independence in Eritrea has reached a decisive stage , with rebel forces braced to meet a Major offensive by Ethiopian troops . The rebels have grown far beyond the roving bands of guerrilla fighters who harassed Ethiopian soldiers a decade ago . They are now a full-fledged army , operating along the lines of conventional warfare in battalions 700 strong . They are heavily armed and highly trained . A two-week trip by this correspondent with guerrillas of the Eritrean Liberation Front confirmed that they had made significant advances over the last several months . Together with the forces of the Eritrean People 's Liberation Front , a faction that split off in 1970 and now cooperates in an uneasy military alliance , they control roughly 85 percent of the 50,000-squaremile province of Eritrea and all but about 300,000 of its 3.5 million people . From huts of woven grass nestled under spreading acacia trees , administrators in patchwork ? battle garb run schools , clinics , plantations and prisoner-of-war camps . The huts are designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberated zone " the Eritreans command everything but the airspace . In recent weeks , however , F-5 jet fighter aircraft and other American-supplied planes have rarely been spotted , leading to speculation that the Ethiopian forces are running low on spare parts or qualified pilots . The United States , breaking with the Marxist military regime in Addis Ababa , has stopped its arms shipments after 20 years . The Soviet Union , a new ally , has begun deliveries . Because the fear of bombardment lives on , activity is kept to a minimum during the day except in farm areas . The parched plains and boulder-strewn ridges of the lowlands lie absolutely still under the hot sun and buzzing flies . It seems a country ' side that is more than peaceful -- -it is dormant . But at night the landscape comes to life . Scores of trucks and Land-Rovers bearing supplies and troops crisscross the ? dwinding , dusty roads . They stop frequent ; ly at blazing campfires where the guerrillas put down their rifles and sit crosslegged upon straw mats . These are sweet-. tea shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck stops in the American Midwest . The Eritrean Liberatiore Front says it has 25,000 fighters and the Eritrean People 's Liberation Front 15,000 . Most observers believe that these figures are slightly exaggerated and estimate the total number under arms in the two groups at 25,000 to 30,000 ? roughly the same size as the Ethiopian force stationed in their midst . Government-Held Area Shrinking During the last two years the Eritreans have overrun 45 Ethiopian military camps and pressed the Government troops into an ever-shrinking enclave whose stronghold is the Central Highlands . The Ethiopians are now confined to seven cities and towns , including the provincial capital , Asmara , but even there their hold is slipping ? it does not extend to the roads connecting the towns and it usually stops at dusk . At this hour the Ethiopians withdraw to protected encampments and abandon the streets to urban guerrillas . The only route the Government forces can be said to control is the vital 56-mile stretch between Asmara and the Red Sea port of . Massawa . In traveling it , they negotiate cautiously , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for land mines . In a last-ditch attempt to quell the insurrection in its northernmost province , whose 1,000-mile coast is the country 's only access to the sea , Ethiopia 's besieged Government is mounting a major offensive that it calls the " red campaign . " It involves upwards of 200,000 peasant militiamen who are recruited largely in the southern regions , trained for 45 days in makeshift camps near Addis Ababa and then airlifted north to bolster the ranks of the demoralized regulars . Confidence Seems Unshaken The campaign is already under way . It has met with some initial success and because of it Eritrean commanders are reluctant to forecast a timetable for winning the war . But they are confident that they will ultimately repel the attack , even it they suffer temporary setbacks , and so bring their struggle for independence that much closer to victory . " We are not worried , " said Tesfal Woldemichael , secretary general of the Liberation Front . " We have had intelligence reports on their preparations for over a year . We are ready to face the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the war inside Ethiopia . " So far , about 40,000 peasant militiamen out of 70,000 already trained have been moved to staging areas along the three routes leading into the province . On June 5 , the Eritreans began a probing attack in the area of Adua , south of the provincial border . They encountered 12,000 militiamen . In a four-day period they took 30 prisoners , destroyed numerous armored cars and , they said , captured  --  for the first time  --  Soviet-made weapons . In late June the Ethiopian forces scored a notable victory by routing the Ethiopian Democratic Union , a right-wing force that since January had occupied parts of Gondar Province , south of Eritrea along the Sudanese border . Buffer Force Lost The Eritreans , who regard themselves as progressives striving to set up an independent , socialist state , looked upon the Ethiopian Democratic Union as an ideological anathema . But nonetheless they valued its military force of several thousand as a buffer army and one more weight upon the Dergue , the military council of 60 or so officers who rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union broken and most of its troops captured , killed or fleeing into the Sudan , a force of several thousand Ethiopians is entrenched in the border town of Humera and the Eritreans find their western flank exposed . To thwart the advance of an Ethiopian column , led by tanks that could speedacross the lowlands , they have demolished the single bridge that spans the 90-foot-wide Takkaze River and are digging in along the northern bank of the stream . . For the time being , much of the fighting is concentrated around this district capital , 150 miles inside the province . Barentu has been under heavy siege by the front since May 5 when Tessenei , a town 120 miles to the west , was seized after a bloody two-day battle . The military strategy of the independence fighters calls for the simultaneous encircling of all the Ethiopian-held towns . Step by step the noose is to be tightened so that the towns fall one by one along e the route leading to Asmara  --  first Barentu , then Agordat , then Keren and finally the capital itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barentu would be taken within three days . Their forces controlled three large hills overlooking the city , the airport , the market place and other key sites . Ethiopian troops had fled from the camps and were being decimated in house-to-house combat . Then a message from the Ethiopian high command was intercepted , promising reinforcements if the troops could just hold on . The help arrived . A column of Ethiopians , with tanks at the head , regulars at the rear and peasant militia in between , set out from Agordat , 34 miles to the northeast , and broke through guerrilla lines in three days of fighting . With the new troops raising their strength to 2,500 , the Ethiopians regained control over the deserted town and dislodged the Eritrean battalion of 700 from the surrounding hills . Militarily , the Government forces hold a superior position here . From their perches on the hilltops they lob down mortar fire and call for air strikes from the occasional planes that fly over . But the guerrillas move stealthily through the blanket of foliage in the deep gulleys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binoculars trained on Ethiopian soldiers , they are planting mines , laying ambushes , waiting for reinforcements . And they are setting up armaments , including antiaircraft guns . Their three camps are placed in such a way that the Ethiopians can not easily venture out . " We are planning our strategy , " said Saleh Naud Adem , commander of thebattalion , the 262d . " If they move out , we will kick them . If they remain where they are in a few days we will attack them . " He tapped his wristwatch and added : " We know these hills the way we know time . " The 30-year-old commander , who became an active fighter 13 years ago and has been wounded eight times in 130 battles , has seen the Liberation Front evolve over . the years from a ragtag band of commandos into a modem , disciplined army . Flexibility Retained Although it relies upon mechanized transport and . plans troop movements weeks in advance , it has retained the resilence of earlier days , he said . And so its fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into quagmires , now just beginning , and come out ahead in encounters , like the one he is now facing , where they are outnumbered two and three times over . " The Ethiopians are fighting because they are paid to , " the Eritrean commander said . " My men are fighting for a cause . Until there is only one of us left , we will fight to liberate Barentu . " The armed struggle in Eritrea began in September 1961 , when half a dozen men raided a police station and seized 16 guns . They were led by an aging fighter , now dead , who had led resistance to Italian and British occupations . He had been asked by the Eritrean Liberation Front , established by exile students in Cairo the year before , to spearhead a military campaign for independence . In the mid-60 's the movement gathered strength in the Moslem lowlands of Gash and Barka . Fighting with captured weapons , peasants and workers banded together and when their numbers grew they split into separate groups , which in turn grew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government of Emperor Haile Selassie , alarmed by the insurrection , began a policy of bombing and burning villages . According to the Liberation Front , 352 villages were leveled between February and June of that year , with 946 civilian deaths resulting . In two villages all adult males were rounded up , herded into mosques and gunned down . In 1975 the left-wing military officers who deposed the Emperor began a similar campaign of atrocities , members of the front said , but this time it was directed largely against the Christian-populated highlands , where the guerrilla organization was weakest . " Haile Selassie treated the movement as a Moslem conspiracy , directed from the outside , " said one official of the front . " This made it possible for us to get aid from Arab states but divided our people along religious lines . The Dergue treats all Eritreans , Christians and Moslems , as members of the , front to be liquidated . This united us . " Front Enjoys Wide Support Today the liberation groups appear to enjoy the support of almost the entire population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recruits , some as young as 14 years old , run away from home to join up . Peasant fathers boast about their sons " in the field , " and sympathetic workers in the Ethiopian-held cities carry out industrial sabotage . A volunteer militia has been formed drawn largely from seminomads who ride into combat positions on camelback . When villages are " liberated , " there is no looting or raping but , instead , usually a party . The Eritreans argue that culturally , linguistically and historically their land has a separate identity . A former Italian colony , it was administered by Britain for 10 years after World War II and was joined with Ethiopia in a federation under an American-supported United Nations resolution in 1950 . Twelve years later , its autonomy gradually undermined by bribes from Addis Ababa to local officials . prison sentences for dissidents and a growing army of occupation , it was formally annexed into the Ethiopian empire . Since they assert that they have never rightfully belonged to Ethiopia , Eritreans object to their movement 's being called " secessionist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black African states , ever conscious of their own tribal divisions . Instead , the Eritreans maintain that they are fighting a war against a " colonial . oppressor . ' " Our goal is simply to liberate our land as soon as possible , " said . Tesfal Woldemichael , the secretary general . " We see in our military strategy that this is now possible . Now the rural areas are liberated and the cities are being liberated . We are in the final stage just before total victory . " Tomorrow : Rebels in devastated Eritrea lay plans for independence .
