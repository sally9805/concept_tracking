Long before the October war exposed the vulnerability of Israel 's vaunted defense machine , the state-owned , supersecret Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd. , which builds and services planes for peace and war , was showing signs of strain . Its first two tries at building executive jets seemed to have flopped expensively , and its attempts to refurbish and resell old planes appeared to be sputtering . Shortly before the war , Moshe Dayan , then head of the Defense Ministry , tried to oust the company 's boss , Al Schwimmer . <P> A plain-spoken former grease monkey and TWA flight engineer from Bridgeport , Conn. , Schwimmer can barely speak Hebrew after 22 years in Israel . Many military men were troubled by the key role that a civilian with a U.S. passport was playing in their country 's defense . Israel 's Connecticut Yankee has survived , however , and not just because Dayan has been replaced by Shimon Peres , a Schwimmer champion for years . Pressed by mounting criticism and Dayan 's maneuvering , Schwimmer decided just before the October war to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures clearly showed smart management . Since 1968 , export sales had risen to an estimated $43 million from only $6.5 million . Total sales are estimated at $310 million a year ; profits are still kept secret . <P> Much more important for Schwimmer , I.A.I. 's planes and weapons performed well during the October war . The company 's own fighter , the Barak ( Hebrew for lightning ) , did especially well : of the 70 planes that saw combat , only three were lost . The plane carries a General Electric jet engine in an Israeli-built French Mirage III C , the plans for which were spirited out of France when Charles de Gaulle cut off deliveries to Israel after the Six-Day War in 1967 . It is the first fighter ever manufactured in Israel , and a special feather in Schwimmer 's hat . ( Israel buys most of its planes from the U.S. , but I.A.I , services them . ) <P> I.A.I. 's image might have improved much sooner were it not for Schwimmer 's predilection for secrecy ( he is a prime potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war for independence , he smuggled nine war-surplus C-46s and a Constellation out of the U.S. to Israel ( on the pretext of starting a civilian line in Panama ) , then surrendered to the FBI and was fined $10,000 for violating the U.S. arms embargo to Palestine . The smuggling helped create the Israeli Air Force , in which Schwimmer served as its first chief engineer . After the war , he set up his own aircraft servicing business in Burbank , Calif. , but David Ben-Gurion persuaded him to return to organize what eventually became I.A.I. Says Schwimmer : " Ben-Gurion did not know a screw driver from a slide rule , but he had a vision of what the state would need . It was apparent from the beginning that the security situation demanded that we produce our own arms . " Since I.A.I. 's balance sheet became public , Schwimmer 's specific achievements have more and more come to light .
