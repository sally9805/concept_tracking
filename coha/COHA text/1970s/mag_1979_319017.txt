Steady , now : one delicate shudder , then to business . Water with the pill ? Fine . Here we are in Hanover , N.H. , where the Dartmouth College campus quickens to the approach of the fall term and a few of the weaker maple trees are beginning to turn orange . The occasion is the Fourth International Conference on Computers and-what is this ? - the Humanities . Is the conference title a self-contradiction , like " fresh-frozen " or " Young Republican " ? The observer , a humanist in a dry season , resolutely programs himself to suppress his real attitude toward computers , which is a feeling of smugness and superiority masking a feeling of inferiority and hysteria . This dates from an episode ten years ago when he was living in Salzburg , Austria , and a computer sent all of his Diners ' Club bills by surface mail to Salisbury , Australia , but then unaccountably caught its error each month in time to send the subsequent " pay up or die " threats winging directly to Salzburg . <P> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them to be later picked up , dusted off and restored to use . The assembled scholars are classics professors , archaeologists , Shakespeareans , graphic artists , historians and musicians flown in from Norway , Israel , England , Canada , France , India and West Germany , as well as from the U.S. Most of them no longer consider themselves to be innovators merely because they work with computers . These days money does not invariably fall out of academia 's apple trees when the word computer appears in grant proposals . So says Stephen V.F. Waite , a research associate in computing in the humanities at Dartmouth , and an assistant professor of classics . <P> Waite , who organized this ICCH/4 conference , might be computer-classified in the " skinny , mild-mannered , wears glasses , enthusiastic " subset of the " professor " category . He likes computers so much that he bought an array of Hewlett-Packard hardware ( central processing unit , disc drive , digital tape unit , hardcopy printer , typesetter ) with his own money . He set the rig up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $70,000 cost by running a one-man computer typesetting business on the side . Waite 's machines are on display at the conference . A Los Angeles-based colleague named David Packard has been using them to demonstrate a Greek language program . Packard seems to have changed the locks , because when Waite begins noodling with his computer , the thing turns balky and refuses , despite cajoling , to come " up " ( awaken and get to work ) . A computer is either " up " or " down . " <P> Waite , undiscouraged , says that in 1968 he became the second classics student at Harvard to use a computer for Ph.D . thesis research . Now , Waite adds , it is " not outlandish , though still not common " for a Ph.D . candidate in classics to use a computer . There is still resentment though : " I know of humanities departments in which you would not get tenure if you did use computers . "                  @ @ @
