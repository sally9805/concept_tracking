Jerry Rafshoon tries to reverse a popularity slide <P> Is a new Jimmy Carter emerging - tougher , demanding more of his staff , focusing more sharply on issues ? Some recent evidence suggests that there is , despite the polls indicating that the public widely regards him as a weak leader . He acted unusually quickly to obtain the resignation of Adviser Peter Bourne when he became an embarrassment to the White House . He dramatically asserted presidential control over the scandal-tinged General Services Administration . And he has imposed a tighter rein on Cabinet officials . <P> Much of the credit ( or blame ) for this new Carter image belongs to Gerald Rafshoon , 44 , the well-tailored , curly-haired , New York-born adman who has worked in every Carter campaign since 1966 . After unofficially advising Carter since the Inauguration , he joined the White House 's senior staff in July . As the $56,000-a-year Assistant to the President for Communications , Rafshoon has the job of improving the public 's perception of his boss . He follows in the footsteps of such presidential image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagerty and Nixon 's Herbert Klein . <P> Rafshoon believes one of Carter 's problems is that he has not sufficiently followed his own political instincts . As a result , " too many people still feel that they do not know him . He has not made enough of an impression of who and what he really is . " Rafshoon , therefore , has been trying to increase Carter 's exposure in the press and on TV . When the President had his town meeting last month in West Berlin , for instance , Rafshoon arranged for live network coverage of it back in the U.S. After returning home , Carter held his first evening news conference in order to capture much of TV 's prime-time audience . In the near future , Rafshoon plans a few televised presidential interviews . Carter and Rosalynn , meanwhile , have been holding intimate dinners at the White House for news executives , to give them a better feel for his personality and goals . <P> To overcome Carter 's image as a weak leader , Rafshoon has been urging the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus when U.N . Ambassador Andrew Young thoughtlessly equated U.S. treatment of civil rights activists with the Soviet Union 's persecution of its dissidents , he was openly reprimanded by Carter . Similarly , in the wake of the Bourne episode , the President sternly lectured his staff that they would be fired if they broke the law by smoking marijuana or sniffing cocaine . Rafshoon has told Carter , who tends to be extremely loyal to his staff , that it is unwise to keep aides who are not performing well . <P> Another Rafshoon goal is ending the Administration 's confusing zigzags and fuzziness on key issues . Says a White House aide : " Jerry is doing things that should have been done all along . He is concentrating the emphasis on a few major themes and goals . " At Rafshoon 's urging , the Administration on the domestic front has begun focusing mainly on energy , the economy and Government efficiency .
