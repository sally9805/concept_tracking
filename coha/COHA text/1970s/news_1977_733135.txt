txt Americans are on the verge of breaking another energy consumption record ? burning more gasoline in their cars than ever before  --  and the White House does n't like it one bit . Billboards are about to sprout across the U.S. urging citizens to " keep off the gas , " thus reducing what Federal Energy Administrator John F. O'Leary calls " America 's unquenchable thirst for gasoline . " " Do n't discount the possibility , " said a White House energy official , " of another presidential fireside chat urging conservation during the summer driving season . " Federal energy officials are working with giant U.S. corporations on ways to reduce gasoline consumption by company car and truck fleets . " AT &T,; with the largest private car fleet in the world , " said a White House official , " has reduced its gasoline consumption by 6 percent . " On American TV screens this summer a number of entertainment stars ? including Johnny Carson , John Denver , and Pearl Bailey ? will plug the virtues of energy savings , in televised spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and local TV stations . " In the first seven days of July , " says James Bishop , aide to White House energy adviser James R. Schlesinger , " the U.S. may burn more oil than during the entire year of 1944 . " " From all indications so far , " says Mr. O'Leary , " gasoline use this summer will hit a record-high 7.7 million barrels per day , 6.9 percent above last year 's record level . " " I think this summer , " President Carter told his news conference June 13 , " We 'll see the highest use of gasoline in the history of our country " ? one reason , among others , why the President sees an energy catastrophe looming down the road . // From page , 1 Gas-guzzling summer brings new frown Last July , U.S. motorists burned more than 7.3 million barrels of gasoline daily . Already consumption this year is creeping close to that point , with the full brunt of summer driving still ahead . Clearly , soaring gasoline prices have not kept Americans off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite a jump in the retail price of a gallon of regular gasoline from 37.2 cents in Jan. , 1973 , to more than 61 cents today . Clearly , also President Carter has failed to communicate to the American people a sense of urgency about conserving energy , particularly oil . Despite all the publicity the energy crisis has received , roughly half the citizenry ? according to a recent Gallup poll ? do not even realize the U.S. imports oil . In fact , the United States imports almost half the oil it consumes , at a cost which President Carter says may total $45 billion this year ? almost $200 for every American man , woman , and child . The new billboard campaign , sponsored jointly by the Federal Energy Administration and the Outdoor Advertising Association of America , Inc. , is a further effort to convince American drivers to ease up on the gas pedal . Costs of printing the posters have been donated by the advertising association , whose member companies are giving the billboard space , estimated to be worth about $1 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
