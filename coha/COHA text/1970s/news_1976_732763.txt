NEVER IN 30 years of touch-and-go publishing has Shotgun News , published here in the local newspaper office , printed one item of news . But what it lacks in gossipy , interesting prose it makes up in ads that are read by 108,000 subscribers in 26 countries of the world . And not all the ads are gun ads . For example : ?

German Time observe time difference , EVERY ISSUE OF Shotgun News is loaded with thousands of ads for every kind of long gun and handgun imaginable ; for knives , holsters , and other paraphernalia that interest gun lovers . For people who are n't interested in guns , Shotgun News is probably one of the dullest publications around , Even to publisher Snell , who gave up a promising law career to become a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " Why should I ? I 'm not interested in guns . " His plush office in a new building just off the main drag in downtown Hastings has only two guns on the wall , both souvenirs . " THAT 'S ALL I want , " says the nth . letic-looking Snell , who says " special occasions " caused him to acquire those guns . " I do n't want to get involved in collecting guns . I do n't want to get hooked on that . Neither do I think it would be right in a business sense . " Snell believes his " newspaper " is the first of a number of specialty ad publications that have cropped up for hobbyists and collectors since his late father , Crawford , founded Shotgun News 30 years ago . The elder Snell printed the first fourpage Shotgun News  --  all ads , of course  --  on a mimeograph machine in his basement . A small-town Nebraska printer printed the second issue with hot lead type , and from then on Crawford Snell 's dream of becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 108,000 subscribers pays $7.50 a year to read an average of 190 tabloid pages of ads every two weeks . Shotgun News is , by Bob Snell 's estimation , the biggest pu , rveyor of guns its the world . And the thought of offering any news in Shotgun News is , well , unheard of to Snell . After all , his two competitors , Gun Week and the American Shotgunner , offer gun lovers lots of guts news and ; pictures , sometimes in full color . And where is their circulation ? The latest figures put the American Shotgunner circulation at 78,000 , and Gun Week at 30,000 . Snell believes most of his readers are gun dealers and gun collectors , but does n't know for sure because he 's never made any readership surveys . " THERE ARE over 200,000 federally licensed gun dealers in this country so it is not hard to get a circulation of 100,000 just among them , " he points out . Ads its Shotgun News begin at 10 cents a word for regular size type and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There also are rates for quarter- , half- , and full-page ads , as well as a $50 premium for having your ad announced on a banner headline on page one , One recent front page headline announced : " Japanese Sword Evaluation Sheet ? Page 115 . " Inside , on page 115 , David E. Pepin of Grant Park , Ill. , ran an ad wills diagrams showing how to identify various ; Japanese swords . BY FAR TILE biggest job in publishing Shotgun News is putting the ads together in some sort of order in the paper . Soliciting them is no problem . They come in day after day , by the mailbag full , to Snell 's office . The pages of Shotgun News are set by computerized typesetters . The offset printing and the mailing is done at the local newspaper office , A giant in the Chicago printing industry has been lobbying for the $500,000-a-year printing contract by wining and dining Snell . But Bears tickets notwithstanding , he has held back . Snell prefers to have the printing shop close to home ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup and put his fingers in the ink if he gets the urge . TO SNELL. publishing Shoopm News ? it cost him $400,000 to purchase from his father a few years back  --  beats lawyering for a living . But the job does have its potential traps , foremost of which is that terrible pain to gun lovers called gun laws . Says Snell : " I 'm vitally interested in gun laws and postage regulations , They can make or break me . " Take 1968 , for example , the year Congress outlawed mail-order sale of guns between individuals . Before the law , Shotgun News sold 60,054 copies every two weeks . A year later circulation was down to 50,900 . WITH MAIL-ORDER sales now a felony , it seemed the Shotgun News was destined for the same publishing graveyard occupied by two previous publishing ventures of Crawford Snell , " The Nebraskan Fireman " and something called " Trade A Boat , " The circulation setback was only temporary , however . Gun lovers soon learned they need n't travel to a distant city to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question was exchanged by licensed gun dealers in the two cities . The customer then purchased the gun from his local dealer . " The law was not designed to stop shipments through the mail , " Snell argues . " Rather , it was to prevent guns from getting in the hands of the wrong individuals . Shipping guns from one dealer to another does not circumvent the law . " WITH THAT Irritant out of the way . plus a promotional campaign among known gun owners , subscriptions shot back up . Before long Snell expects them to be nearly twice what they were before the federal gun law . The biggest state circulation is in California . However , the city where Shotgun News is most popular is Chicago . In August the newspaper celebrated its 30th anniversary . And , true to form , this milestone in publishing went unmentioned in Shotgun News .
