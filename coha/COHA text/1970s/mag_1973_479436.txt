DR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other people have said the same . HE PATIENT WAS A WOMAN in her late fifties I who had already undergone a partial resection of her stomach for cancer. * Nine months later , the tumor had spread into her liver and invaded her spine , and another operation was performed . Narcotics and sedatives could not overcome her pain : her doctors recommended radiation therapy . But the pain became progressively worse . Normally the life of a cancer patient like Mrs. Proctor would end in a miserable spiral : one by one , new organ systems would be assaulted by the spread of malignancy or by heroic medical attempts to slow the cancer with lethal radiation , toxic intravenous drugs , or surgery that often must be mutilative to offer any chance of success . While the blood count , pulse rate , electrocardiogram , liver function , and urinary composition of these patients may be monitored with care , rarely does anyone talk with them about their illness , about the very imminent prospect of dying . Mrs. Proctor was luckier ; her surgeon was sensitive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been changed , along with those of the other patients mentioned in this article . and spoke to her of a research project involving the use of LSD to ease the agony of terminal illness . She decided to volunteer . In an era when slow degenerative diseases ( heart disease , the cancers ) are replacing older , often quicker killers ( like pneumonia , " the old man 's friend " ) , Mrs. Proctor 's isolation at the edge of death was not unusual . Generally , when the terminal patient is brought into a hospital , tubes are hung from every orifice like space-age talismans to ward off the spirit of death . The burial begins soon thereafter : visits become shorter and more awkward ; if the dying happens in a university medical center , doctors and medical students making morning rounds may begin to pass by the room without entering . Some physicians prescribe morphine around the clock ; others , motivated by a sense of duty , or fear of lawsuit , or mere compulsiveness , mobilize the awesome armamentarium of medical technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patient is often treated more as a set of degenerating systems than as an individual watching the terrifying approach of his own end . Most medical discussions of this subject have been narrowly linear : should the doctor attempt to lengthen the patient 's life , or perhaps shorten it ? Only rarely has anyone asked more creative questions or considered what rights a patient might have in deciding the shape his last weeks will take . For several years now , a little-publicized project has been going on at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center in Catonsville , just outside Baltimore . The work embodies the assumption that it is at least as important to deal with a dying person 's psychic anguish as with his physical pain . The research concerns the use of psychedelic drugs within the framework of psychiatric counseling to help patients achieve a transcendent level of awareness from which it may he possible for them to deal more easily with impending death . Years before LSD became the illegal sacrament of the counterculture , psychiatrists at the Catonsville center , led by Dr. Albert Kurland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if its profound mind-altering powers could possibly help in the therapy of those for whom altered states of consciousness were a way of life . Gradually , a remarkable phenomenon emerged : with striking regularity , and with no suggestion from the therapists , many of the LSD subjects would undergo an experience of " dying " and " being reborn " that often left them with a much more serene , well-integrated approach to life that persisted long afterward . The following description of the drug session of a fifty-one-year-old homeless alcoholic illustrates this well : " Now I found myself not as a person but as what I can only describe as my soul or spirit . I was part of everything ugly , dirty , and filthy . I traveled through intestines , garbage , dung , in and out of a rectum , and anything else you can imagine ... It seems I became part of everything , good or bad . I did n't think I would ever get out of this . Next , I was going down through a lot of misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse it got . I was going clown something like a black vein that got smaller the further down I went . The closer I got to the end of it , the more afraid I became . I saw a vulture which I took as Death , or the Devil . When 1 got to the end , I was too terrified to look at it for fear of what I might see . Very much to my surprise , when I forced myself to look at the end , I iound whatever it was I was afraid to look at was nothing . . " After seeing all these horrible things , I came up to the beautiful and the wonderful . I continued to go higher , passing among billions and millions of minute spirits like myself . I felt a very , very small part of the whole thing . There seemed a small place above and beyond every thing else , and I found myself being drawn to this place . After getting to this peak , I found who I thought was God . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatness . Something made me feel He wanted me to exchange positions with Him . This I did n't want to do because I felt unworthy . He insisted , so we made the change . It was a wonderful feeling to be there with I I im , far beyond any of the ambitions of any astronaut peaceful and wonderful . , " It seemed at about this time I I 'm not sure if this is in the right sequence ) I found myself looking up and seeing Jesus a long distance above me . My body started to fill out to perfection and I wanted to go to Jesus . I reached my arm toward Him and I started to rise up to Him . As I got closer to Him , I began taking on His appearance . Something seemed to be holding me clown , but I wanted so much to go to Him . I looked down and my body seemed to be tearing apart from my feet up . I kept reaching for Him . The closer I got to Him the less there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I wanted to go to Him . Finally , when I got to Him , I became Him . I was Jesus and He was me . We were one . " Once , an experience like this would have been considered a manifestation of something holy , a bridge between our transient lives and Something Else . For our ancestors , encounters with the divine and demonic were legitimate facts of human existence Today , if this sort of thing happens spontaneously , we call it an " acute schizophrenic break with paranoid delusions and experiences of depersonalization . " These ritual words are inscribed on a sheet of pink paper arid thrust into the hands of an ambulance driver , a first step toward " curing " the patient of his " mental illness , " or at least preventing him from having his visions in public . Since the Enlightenment , Western civilization has steadily narrowed its view of the broad spectrum of consciousness , focusing on the pure , cool light of science to the exclusion of the more subtle and exotic colors beyond . Rationality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can openers in exchange for the kingdom with in . Death has suffered a parallel disfigurement : we find it hard even to imagine what medieval writers meant by ars moriendi ? the art of dying . With the passing of God , death has moved from the province of philosophy and theology to that of medicine . On one level , we medical professionals can claim better results than our predecessors . What priest could measure up to a well-placed defibrillator , what man of God could infuse the breath of life with the efficacy of a Bird Mark IV respirator ? We can even raise the dead , if we get there fast enough . Yet somehow in the process , we have made death another mass-produced , impersonal commodity controlled by expert providers rather than by the consumer . This narrow-minded attention to the preservation of vital signs is not enough . As if completing a cycle , a new kind of technology is developing that may put us hack in touch with the human roots from which other applications of science have alienated us . Coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Swiss biochemist studying derivatives of ergot was met with remarkably little interest . Over the next twenty-five years , researchers explored the molecular configuration of the drug and its contractile effects upon the rat uterus and tentatively looked into its effects on consciousness . But the mainstream of psychiatric research and practice flowed on , almost oblivious to these startling reports . One project that appeared and was then virtually forgotten by most of medicine was an experiment by Eric Kast , a physician at the University of Chicago Medical School . In the early 1960s , Kast found that LSD ( still practically unknown , even in medical circles ) had pain-relieving properties far more potent in many ways than morphine and its derivatives . Kast initially viewed the drug simply as an analgesic and administered it to terminal patients without regard for its hallucinogenic effects . His early results , published in a 1964 issue of Anesthesia and Analgesia : Current Research , did mention one unusual aspect of the drug 's action : " In addition to pain relief , these patients displayed a peculiar disregard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their impending death with an affect considered inappropriate in our western civilization but most beneficial to their own psychic states . This approach to their disease was noted usually for longer periods than the analgesic action lasted . " The possibility that LSD therapy might lighten both the physical and psychic anguish of dying became more immediate for the Catonsville group in 1965 : a research assistant working there was diagnosed as having inoperable carcinoma of the breast . When it became clear that neither medical nor surgical therapy had more to offer . and the pain grew increasingly severe , she agreed to become the group 's first terminal LSD subject . The encouraging results of her therapy led to a systematic study of the usefulness of LSD therapy fur the dying . Since those early days at Catonsville , psychedelic therapy with terminal patients has been crafted into a form involving elements of psychoanalysis , music therapy , neuropharmacology , Buddhist cosmology , existential psychotherapy , and traditional medical care to guide the dying patient through his suffering and , ideally , into a level of transcending awareness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( by now well known to the patient ) and a specially trained nurse arrive at the bedside with a portable stereo , headphones , eyeshades , some fresh roses , and a dose of pure LSD or related psychedelic that is three or four times as strong as the amount usually used when the drug is taken illegally . Even before the drug takes effect , the patient puts on the stereo headphones and the eyeshades ? to ease the journey inward and minimize distractions . The therapist ? who is present throughout the session encourages time patient to " get into " whatever internal imagery he is experiencing , no matter how unpleasant . This approach departs from popular notions of the " bad trip " ; the therapists feel that if you are battling dragons or being devoured by flames , those represent personal psychic spaces you must pass through , not around . This requires from the patient an almost perfect trust in the therapist and nurse ? enough to take their word that it 's safe.to be sucked into what may seem like an absolutely real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go of his own ego structure enough , he may achieve a sense of unity with all creation so strong that the decomposition of his earthly body will seem infinitely less important . In addition to reassurance . the therapists use music to modulate the drug experience . Through the subject 's posture , gestures , and occasional comments , an experienced guide can sense where the drug is taking him and can select music to deepen or shift the experience . ( All of the Catonsville therapists have been through one or more training LSD sessions themselves . ) If the drug has produced frightening imagery and the therapist feels the subject is confronting material that should not be avoided , he might play a Sturm and Drang selection like " The Ride of the Valkyries . " Or , if the patient has reached a placid plateau , the therapist might put on Debussy 's La Mer to prolong the moment . Special music is reserved for the evocation and accompaniment of the peak experience : the climax of Tristan . and I soIde , Strauss ' Death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass . B EFORE ANY OF THIS CAN START , however , the way must be cleared by conventional psychotherapy . In a culture that views death as something obscene , and that has endless ways of distracting our attention from it , the patient must first be brought to the point where he can admit the certainty of his own mortality . Often this is a major barrier , especially for the family . The late Dr. Walter Pahnke , who directed the early LSD-therapy research in Catonsville , came up hard against the problem in treating the woman whose words opened this article . " The family 's greatest reluctance over having the treatment at all , " he recalled , " was the fear that the patient would discover her diagnosis . They had decided in the past that she should never know , and that they would lie to her about her condition so as not to take away her hope and to keep her happy . However , in the last few months her psychological condition had worsened greatly and she was filled with anxiety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for the sake of the patient 's family members , who can not bear to confront the reality of a relative 's ? and hence their own ? mortality . No doubt Prometheus 's real sin was not that he let out the secret of fire but rather that he endowed man with the power to forget the inevitability of death . It 's a knack that keeps most of us going , helping to preserve the illusion that our day-to-day activities really do matter . Yet for all of us , after all , life is a terminal condition , and thinking about a loved one whom doctors have given six months to live can lead to jarring thoughts4bout our own lives , even if their expectancy is measured in years . or in decades . So , traditionally , the games continue around the dying patient , usually increasing his anxiety as the suspicion grows that no one is leveling with him . At a time when closeness is one of the *Interestingly , " protection " of a dying patient from the truth is rarely successful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Cancer Society showing that 80 percent of terminal cancer patients know their diagnosis whether they have been told it or not . only remaining sources of joy , it is undermined by an unacknowledged system of deceptions whose intricacy can reach Laingian dimensions , as Dr. Pahnke discovered with Mrs. Proctor : " It was obvious that she was testing me out . Although she was extremely frightened of the possibility of cancer , she was at the same time intensely curious . She had been playing this game with her family for years . Because of their own fear about death , they had interpreted this to mean that she really did not want to know . Her daughter and husband told me that she had been worried about getting cancer for forty years . They all assured me that the patient was a very nervous person and that she could not possibly stand to know the truth ; otherwise she would go to pieces . " The psychological choreography required for this work can be exquisitely difficult . On their first meeting , Mrs. Proctor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have cancer , do n't 1 ? " and followed immediately with , " But do n't tell me , I do n't want to know what I have . " He relied on an approach often used by doctors who must deal with a preterminal patient : never lie , but let the patient set the timetable of discovery . When they 're ready to know , they 'll ask . In the subsequent two weeks I one lacks the leisure of normal psychotherapy here ) , Dr. Pahnke and Mrs. Proctor explored issues of life and death , and again she asked her question , this time without the caveat . He told her the truth . " Although quite upset , " Pahnke recalled , " she was able to talk about the matter rationally , with some genuine emotion . She then admitted to me that she had really known all along that she had cancer , or at least strongly suspected it . in spite of the denials of her family . She expressed sonic concern that they were having a difficult time dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her too . " Another patient , Mrs. Busen , a fifty-year-old woman who knew her diagnosis of widely metastatic cancer of the ovaries , also had to overcome the denials of well-meaning relatives . " It was very hard for some of my family to swallow the words dead and dying , and to say them . In fact , they ca n't say them yet . It 's my mother-in-law who has refused to face the fact that I 'm even sick . She calls every morning to see how I slept . She thinks that every day I 'm going to feel better , so she refuses to accept the fact that I ca n't possibly feel better ? that if I feel the same as I felt yesterday which was a good day , fairly good ) , fine . " My husband had gotten tickets for Acapulco next February , and he would say , ' Oh . you 'll be well enough . Do n't he silly ? we 've got reservations , ' and all this kind of baloney , and I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next February . He 's been playing games with me since April and because of the pre-I.S1 ) 1 therapy the game stopped being played and we faced what we had we learned to enjoy each day together , even if it was just sitting watching a baseball game . And we 've enjoyed each other so much more because I do n't have the anxiety when I talk to him : the fear of hurting him , and he was always afraid of hurting me . So , in this sense , the therapy helped as much as the LSD . " Once this groundwork has been laid , the therapy proceeds to the drug experience . Pahnke , who held a Ph.D . in religion from Harvard as well as an M.D. from its medical school , brought to the work a deep interest in the " peak experiences " described by humanistic psychologists like Abraham Maslow and by centuries of religious mystics . As described by Maslow , people who achieved spontaneous peak experiences frequently felt an ineffable joy that they attributed to a fuller understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shown that subjects who underwent the death-rebirth-ecstasy experience were left with a " psychedelic afterglow " that seemed to infuse them with an exultant clarity that lasted long after the drug had left the body ? and that seemed similar to the effects of other kinds of peak experience . Knowing the importance of " set and setting " ( expectation and environment ) to the character of the drug experience , the Catonsville group set about devising a therapeutic program that would maximize the chances of inducing a " peak . " Now , in a modern new building ( constructed under the auspices of then governor Spiro Agnew 1 , as part of their work with cancer patients less far advanced in the course of the disease , they use specially designed " psychedelic treatment rooms " that at first look like comfortable living rooms : carpeting , sofa , stereo . Only one element distinguishes the rooms from thousands like them in homes across the country ? the small remote-controlled TV camera placed in a recess of the breakfront , for videotape recording of the drug sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer project , about one-third have reached what the Catonsville group considers a pure peak experience , with many more having less ecstatic but nonetheless therapeutic sessions . Psychic spaces W HEN WALTER PAHNKF disappeared suddenly while scuba diving off the Maine coast in the summer of 1971 . Dr. Stanislav Grof assumed leadership of the cancer project . A Czech-born psychiatrist , Grof first became interested in psychedelics as a medical student in Prague when he volunteered for some of the earliest LSD research , which involved studying the drug 's effects on the electroencephalographic response to a Hashing light . During the experiment , the strobe light and drug combined to generate in him an ecstatic experience of oneness that he still remembers vividly . While in Czechoslovakia , Grof pioneered in using LSD therapy to unlock unconscious material in psychotic and severely neurotic patients , within the framework of analytic therapy . An uncommonly quiet , tall man of forty-one , Dr. Grof has a manner that reflects the respectability necessary for this work : his medical credentials are solid ( he is on the faculty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his dress conservative . Yet when discussing the psychic spaces through which he guides his patients , he speaks with genuine empathy . His knowledge of the biochemistry and pharmacology of the drugs he uses is combined with a broad familiarity with the literature and theology of the ancient Orient . Mrs. Betser , a forty-five-year-old black factory worker with cervical cancer , illustrates the promise Crof sees in drug-assisted terminal therapy . Having undergone a hysterectomy and chemotherapy , Mrs. Betser was readmitted to the hospital seven months later with persistent weight loss , constipation , loss of appetite , difficulty breathing , and chest pain . Neither she nor any of her family knew of her diagnosis ; she discovered that she had cancer only when she overheard doctors discussing her case outside her room . Predrug counseling included her husband , oldest son , and other relatives , and worked toward enabling them to express their feelings about Mrs. Betser 's impending death . Then she was given DPT ( dipropyltryptamine ) , a short-acting psychedelic with effects similar to those of LSD but lasting three to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her experience was described by William Richards , who like his wife , a psychiatric nurse , is one of the more experienced therapists in the cancer project : - On April 20 , 1971 , 75 mg. of D PT was administered to Mrs. Betser . Initially , she experienced herself as a mad beast , something akin to a lion , and vomited intensely during approximately six episodes over perhaps 45 minutes . Each episode of vomiting seemed to have considerable psychological meaning to her , as though she was freeing herself of depression , anger , and frustration . She then became very quiet and , upon subsequent inquiry , said , ' I died , you know . ' She stated that she had seen various relatives , both living and dead , and also had experienced God awaiting her with outstretched arms . She claimed she had embraced God and found that there was ' No death anywhere . ' In the latter part of the session , she saw imagery about a little boy who continually blocked her way . At first , she suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had miscarried , but later she identified him as her husband Sam . She asked for her father 's picture and held it to her bosom as she had done with pillows during preparatory interviews . " Mrs. Betser was seen at her home by both therapist and nurse on June 22 , 1971 . Her husband was present with us during this interview . She had edema to her waist , was having trouble breathing , and manifested considerable additional weight loss . . . She said , ' I ca n't live much longer in this body , ' and again invited therapist and nurse to come to the funeral home to pay their last respects following her death . She was taking one tablet of codeine every four hours and claimed that she had no pain . She stated that if she did not take the codeine she became irritable . Her husband had been very supportive , and both were obviously facing the imminence of her death as fully as possible . " At two o'clock on the morning of July 1 , 1971 , Mrs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink water . Her husband , alone with her at the time , held her hand and talked with her for approximately one hour . He remembered this talk as a meaningful time . Around 3:00 A.M. , she stated that she felt similar to the way she felt at the beginning of her session as though she were a wild animal ? and expressed a desire to shout . Her husband encouraged her to go ahead and shout if she felt like it , and she did . After lying clown and sitting up several times , she chose to remain in a sitting position and encouraged her husband to get some sleep in the other room . Her husband reluctantly lay clown , slept for one and one-half hours , and awakened to find that Mrs. Betser had died . " WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE ABILITY of the V V psychedelic experience to ease the psychological pain of dying ? Dr. Grof offers one answer : " Death , instead of being seen as the ultimate end of everything and a step into nothingness , appears suddenly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergo the **32;2898;TOOLONG experience . The idea of possible continuity of consciousness beyond physical death becomes much more plausible than the opposite . The patients who have transcendental experiences develop a rather deep belief in the ultimate cosmic unity of all creation and experience themselves as part of it without regard to the situation they are facing . " The encounter with elements of the deep unconscious in the form of transpersonal experiences ( such as Jungian archetypes , racial and collective memories , experience of the cosmic drama . divine and demonic appearances ) enables them to relate in a very tangible and convincing way to psychic realities that are far beyond their individual frameworks . It seems that it is this opening of the transpersonal and cosmic panorama that provides a background and referential system against which the fact of individual destruction appears relatively unimportant . " Asked to explain the consistency of the feelings and imagery many of the terminal patients experience , Grof 's answer is characteristically cautious : " Whether these are valid insights into the nature of reality , or merely merciful delusions , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the evidence is impressive : without coaching or suggestion , patients with religious backgrounds varying from atheism to church-everySunday somehow experience the knowledge of an alternate reality-system that may be completely foreign to them . And there is a striking correspondence between this kind of reality and the concepts found in the sacred books of Taoism , the Upanishads of Hinduism , the Gospel according to SI.John , the teachings of Buddha , and the works of mystics throughout history . In a recent paper . Grof carefully suggests that a common cosmology can be derived from the experiences reported during the 3,500 or so drug sessions he has either conducted or studied , here and in Czechoslovakia . The example of Seth Case illustrates this phenomenon . A middle-aged laborer with only a rudimentary education and a homespun fundamentalist Christian belief , Case was in the terminal stage of metastatic lung cancer . Predrug counseling was limited by his debilitated condition and the literal , almost childlike simplicity with which he viewed the psychedelic treatment . His session took place during the month I spent with the Catonsville group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution over the closed-circuit TV system . After an hour or so , it became clear that Case ? despite all he had been told beforehand ? viewed the drug treatment as something to take his pain away ; the idea that the content of the experience was important seemed to he lost . Periodically he would say , " I hope I ai n't doin ' this wrong , " or , " Do I have to go through this every day ? " and then return to his inner journey , without the running verbal commentary that often accompanies subjects ' visions . The next day , hours after the drug effects had worn off , Dr. Grof discussed the session with him . At first Case kept referring to the pain , how the " treatment " had helped it somewhat , how he had slept , how his bowels were working . Despite Grof 's questions about the experience itself , he seemed reluctant to discuss it , as if what he had seen and heard during the treatment had no more importance for its effect than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment , he described what he had been through : MR . CASE : I was in a junkyard . Everything got thrown together : skeletons , cans , whatall . Then everything got burned , destroyed , by a big ball of fire . . . I felt I was pin ' in it too . I felt all my bones was in amongst all those other things . Like you said , you had to let it bypass you , or let it know it did n't get the best of you . During your session you mentioned Jehovah . MR . CASE : That 's when the prcachin ' was goin ' on ? how your soul is saved when you come back to earth you 'd be another ? er ? ah , person , or whatever you 'll be when you come back , why that 's what you 'll be . Whether it 's an animal , or what . You could he something different . Sometimes , in a dream you may think like you 're gon na be your own self , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll be something else . Just take what comes in life . DR . GROF : Some of these feelings are new , are n't they ? I did n't hear you talking like this before . MR . CASE : This is through this experience . This is what I feel through all this other stuff that was goin ' through me .... That you 'll be living , in other words that your soul will be livin ' , your soul will be with you all the time , but yet you do n't know what you 'll be on the next earth . DR . CROF : Do you feel that you will live in another form ? MR . CASE : Yeah , I feel that way , yes .... I did n't want to get into this junkyard ? course I was in it and that was it , but it all came to turn out the way I wanted it , you know , that I 'd be more ... more delightful , you know , more succeeding although I seen all them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any other things you remember from the session ? Not right off . Did you actually become aware of God during any part of the session ? Yeah , I felt like he was savin ' me .. I feel I 'm livin ' through God , that 's the way I 'd put it , if you can understand that right . I feel like God 's the onliest person can help you , can save you ... If you do n't got no faith in Him , why you ai n't got no faith in nobody . It 's yourself ? the way you feel about it ... Course I always says my prayers every night before going to bed . jORILE DRS . PAHNKE AND GROF both placed V V emphasis on helping subjects reach a peak unitive experience , not all of them have . There are , however , levels of transcendence , and the majority of patients do appear to experience some kind of heightened insight into the meaning of their own death , even if it falls short of cosmic consciousness . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring photographs of family members or friends to whom they feel especially close . With these as a trigger , the drug may make possible vivid reliving of life experiences . Patients often are reimmersed in feelings of warmth and closeness normally too powerful to allow into conciousness . Alternatively ( and less commonly , because of the supportive setting of the sessions ) , the patient may recall long-repressed bitter or tragic moments . In this case , the reexperiencing is often accompanied by a sense of catharsis , of resolving painful intrapsychic conflicts that had been generating considerable tension ( a phenomenon common in conventional psychiatry , elicited with its much weaker tools of spontaneous recall and free-association ) . There is , additionally , the issue of bodily pain . Neurophysiologists believe that the perception of pain has two components : the physical sensation itself , and the psychological interpretation of that sensation . LSD may have an effect on the latter . In line with Kast 's earlier speculations , Dr. Grof points out : " The experience of present pain involves activation of experiences of pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuation of the pain in the future . In that case , the unusual propensity of LSD to decrease the emphasis on past and future events and to increase the awareness of the present moment could reduce these anachronistic components of pain . In addition . the expansion of awareness and broadening of the sensory field could facilitate defocusing on the source of painful stimulation , thus alleviating the meaning of pain and its frightful psychic resonance . " In a paper presented to a symposium of the Foundation of Thanatology , Dr. Grof and his colleagues reported a highly significant increase in patients ' ability to tolerate their pain , as measured by several medical and family observers . Other variables such as depression , anxiety , fear of death , and social isolation also showed significant improvement , although unbiased measurement is notoriously difficult . These effects may or may not be permanent ; if a patient begins to suffer difficulty weeks or months after the initial drug session , another is often arranged . Nonetheless , not every patient who volunteers for the cancer project is left strikingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response , like Mr. Black : DR .

N 0 PATIENTS HAVE DETERIORATED physically or psychologically as a result of their drug therapy : still , it is hard to quantify the " success rate " of LSD-assisted death therapy . First , there is no reliable way to measure improvement in psychosocial well-being . Second , the small size of the sample makes generalization difficult . As the procedure gains more acceptance , Dr. Grof and his associates hope to make this kind of therapy available to more than just pilot-scale numbers of people . But right now that goal seems distant . Consciousness-altering drugs and the study of death are seemingly taboo subjects in our culture , for both are powerful reminders of the fragility and arbitrariness of our day-to-day existences . Even predeath counseling , the least revolutionary aspect of this work , meets heavy resistance ( usually in the form of apathy ) in most medical schools and hospitals . Then there is the public fear of psychedelic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies have shown that the specter of " chromosome damage " raised a few years ago was more the product of sensationalism and sloppy research than of fact. * Furthermore , a great deal of evidence has accumulated suggesting that if pure psychedelics are administered in supportive , supervised environments . the chance of real psychological damage in healthy subjects is vanishingly small . What these drugs do appear to do is provide access to a form of reality that challenges bedrock assumptions of Western culture , assumptions about the nature of man and the purpose of life that have been carried to often grotesque extremes in contemporary America . Death ca n't be made illegal , but altered states of consciousness can . When in the late Sixties the government stamped out virtually all human LSD research except for Catonsville and a small research enclave in Topeka , Kansas , it appeared , like the thirteenth-century Church forbidding the dissection of human bodies by early anatomists , to be denying an expansion of consciousness beyond the borders certified by the dominant culture . Perhaps after a few more years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal drugs will , by sheer mass effect , enable the awareness of other kinds of reality to become a powerful cultural force in its own right . But , for the present , above-ground investigations into the effects of these drugs proceed at a glacial pace . Until the rest of us are able to use these substances in protected settings and decide for ourselves the validity of the ontological insights suggested by this kind of research , we may have to learn some of our most valuable lessons on what it means to live from those who are about to die .
