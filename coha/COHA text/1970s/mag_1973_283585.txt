San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto announced last week that he will seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of California next year , and what he is using to recommend himself to the voters is , of all things , his connection with Watergate principals . When charges linking Alioto with the Mafia were published four years ago , they were followed with a set of allegations concerning fee-splitting in Washington State . Alioto successfully defended himself against both sets of charges in court , and he never misses an opportunity to voice his contention that the men behind the fee-splitting charge were none other than John Mitchell , John Ehrlichman and Egil ( " Bud " ) Krogh . He thus lays claim to being the first victim of the " unprincipled political saboteurs of Watergate , " and a man who beat them . Alioto is well-financed and has a progressive record as mayor ; the Watergate ploy seems designed in part to boost his standing with Democratic voters . In recent preferential polls , Alioto placed second ( with 22% ) to California Secretary of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though Brown has not yet announced , his popular father served two terms as Governor-and that connection California Democrats seem to find easy enough to remember without Brown 's mentioning it at all .
