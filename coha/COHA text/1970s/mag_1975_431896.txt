 | Until the time when medical science finds a sure cure , the best weapon against cancer is early diagnosis and prompt treatment . This is especially so with regard to cancer of the breast . When that malignancy is found in an early stage ( as in the case of Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller ) , the " cure rate " ( measured in terms of five years ' survival after treatment ) is close to 90 percent . But once the cancer cells have spread ? it 's usually to the lymph nodes under the arm ? the cure rate drops to about 50 percent . ( In Mrs. Gerald Ford 's case only two lymph nodes were involved and her chances have been set at 70 percent . ) No wonder , then , that experts emphasize the critical importance of the earliest possible detection . In recent years millions of women have been taught how to examine their own breasts ? yet most of them do not do so regularly . There have also been major improvements in X-ray and heat-detection devices used in mammography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermography ? yet most women either do not or can not avail themselves of these techniques . So despite these advances toward early diagnosis , the American Cancer Society 's statistics show that there has been no significant improvement in the cure rate over the past 35-year period . The question seems to be : How early is early enough ? Today , an answer may be in the making in the Breast Cancer Diagnostic Clinic at Santa Barbara , Calif. , General Hospital . There , a doctor named Otto W.  | Sartorius is developing a technique that may make it possible to detect breast cancer earlier than ever before . He says he has succeeded in identifying and locating malignant cells ? and even cells which are not malignant as yet , but have the potential to become so ? years before they could develop into a palpable lump in the breast . According to Dr. Sartorius , his method can also pick up signs of the disease well before they can be found by breast X-rays or thermography . If his findings stand the test of time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagnostic method can have enormous significance . The reason ? Today , almost all of the 90,000 new cases per year of breast cancer are first discovered by women themselves via self-examination . However , says the ACS , by the time a woman can feel a lump the chances are six out of ten that if it is cancerous the malignant cells already will have spread . ( It should be emphasized here that the vast majority of breast lumps turn out not to be malignant . ) Thus , Sartorius ' " very early warning " system ? if it can be applied on a mass screening basis ( and there are problems about this that we 'll discuss later ) ? has the potential to double the chance of survival for hundreds , perhaps thousands of women , including many whose cancers might not have shown up on a mammogram . Statistics about cancer can be tricky ; projecting them is even trickier . Yet that estimate is rooted in the basic ACS statistics . The 60 percent of cases where spreading has occurred by the time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? before the proliferation of cancer cells ? could raise these women 's chances of being cured from the 45 to the 90 percent level . This does not , however , mean that Sartorius ' technique will automatically make it possible to avoid breast surgery . Like most of his colleagues , Sartorius believes that , once malignancy is detected , some form of mastectomy is almost always the wisest course . That is the best way to make sure all cancer cells are removed , and to guard against a recurrence of the disease . " It is far more important at this point in the battle against breast cancer to concentrate on saving lives rather than breasts , " Sartorius says . Sartorius ' new diagnostic approach is based on a microscopic analysis of cells extracted from the hair-thin ducts that lead from the nipple to the interior of the breast . In tests on more than 2,000 women , Sartorius and his co-workers have found early cancer cells that were otherwise undetectable ? either by touch or by X-ray ? in one out of every 200 patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of Sartorius ' work has been done on women who already had breast problems ? not on women who were apparently healthy . If all his patients had been drawn from the population at large , he would surely have found fewer instances of pathology . ) I talked recently with several of those women . In her beachfront home in Santa Barbara , a woman I 'll call Alice Ryan told me how she had noticed a yellow discharge from her nipple on her bra about 18 months before . Alarmed , Mrs. Ryan immediately went to see her gynecologist . He could  | feel no lump , and her mammogram test was negative . But Mrs. Ryan continued to worry . " It seemed foolish to think about cancer after the results of my checkups , " she said . " But I did n't want to run even the slightest risk .... " When she asked her doctor about getting another medical opinion , he suggested she see Dr. Sartorius , with whose research he was familiar . When Mrs. Ryan did so , microscopic examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer . Other tests confirmed the finding . ( Although he does not question results of cell analysis , Sartorius does not consider it a substitute for more traditional diagnostic procedures , only an additional one . He also palpates and X-rays every patient . Nor does he ever proceed with a mastectomy until a biopsy has confirmed the diagnosis . ) Mrs. Ryan recalls that when Dr. Sartorius told her he had found cancer cells in her breast fluid , " I had one intense moment of fear and self-pity . Then I realized I was thankful that there was still time to do something about it . " Just how lucky Mrs. Ryan was became clear when Sartorius found that the cancer cells had extended to the far end of the breast duct and at that point were breaking through the duct wall , although no palpable mass was present . Because of this , Sartorius decided to perfotm a radical mastectomy . Mrs. Ryan believes that had it not been for Sartorius ' early diagnostic method , she might not be alive today . She says that both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been several years before the cancer cells became a lump big enough to feel , or to register on a mammogram . " There 's no telling , " she adds , " how far the trouble would have spread by then . " Cell analysis , or cytology , is a far from new medical tool . Indeed , it is a long-standing and valuable method for diagnosing many ailments . ( Recently , doctors at the Mayo Clinic and at Johns Hopkins University have started routine analysis of cells in sputum as a means of early diagnosis of lung cancer . ) But the technique is most familiar to the lay person for its use in the cervical cancer smear test developed years ago by the American physiologist , Dr , George Papanicolaou . In what is now a routine part of every gynecological exam , cells swabbed from the cervix are screened microscopically for evidence of cancer or for precancerous cells . The " Pap smears " have proven to be more than 85 percent accurate . Interestingly , Papanicolaou himself pondered the idea of analyzing breastfluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writing in the official medical journal of the ACS , he said that a  | routine collection of breast fluids could be developed as part of a physical checkup " with little loss of time . and may lead to the detection of early or unsuspected " breast cancer . From time to time other doctors wrote in medical journals about the potential value of breast cytology . The main ob .. stacle , however , was that there seemed to be no way to extract enough cellcontaining fluid to make a reliable diagnosis . Gradually the idea of breast-cell studies was relegated to an occasional reference in medical textbooks . Today , for the first time , Sartorius ' research promises to make breast-cell analysis a practical technique . His work started in 1966 when , as head of medical education for Santa Barbara General Hospital , Sartorius got a National Institutes of Health grant for a mass testing program on Pap smears . The doctor ? now 59 , and a tall , handsome man with the craggy face and goldrimmed glasses of a frontier doctor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way : " I thought it was crazy to just check a woman for cervical cancer . As long as she is coming to a clinic for tests , why not test both of her main cancer-prone areas ? I decided , " he says , " to try the same diagnostic method on breasts as we used for the cervix . " His background had prepared him well . A graduate of Yale and the Long Island College of Medicine , Sartorius interned as an **25;1354;TOOLONG . He later became an expert in pathology ( the study of cells and tissues ) , a professor of physiology and , in 1958 , a certified surgeon . He has practiced surgery in Santa Barbara for 13 years , and served as president of the ACS chapter there . In addition , Sartorius has suffered enough illness himself to be able to empathize with the feelings of his patients . As a child , he suffered from a severe bone infection in the leg . In those pre-antibiotic days little could be done to help him and he spent four years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have his hip fused to prevent the infection from spreading . He now walks with a limp . Before Sartorius could test his ideas about breastcell analysis , he had to devise a method for extracting fluid from the breast . Although medical texts still say that the female breast has 20 ducts , Sartorius found that while there are 20 openings in the nipple , most of them are " dead end " false ducts . The average woman has seven to nine true ducts , each with its own slit-like aperture at the tip . Ordinarily , unless a woman is nursing a child , no fluid comes out of the nipple because a tiny sphincter muscle in each duct keeps it closed . " But there is always fluid within the ducts , " says Sartorius . " Like all cells , those in the duct walls die and are replaced , the dead cells being sloughed off into the fluid and gradually reabsorbed into the bloodstream . " Early experimental attempts by Papanicolaou and others to extract this fluid were cumbersome and ineffective , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipple and can draw fluid from deep within the ducts painlessly and in sufficient quantity for testing . With this device , he overcame one big obstacle to successful cell analysis , but another and more fundamental problem has proved more stubborn : the fact that the breasts of an estimated one out of every five women do not yield fluid . Among women of childbearing age , there is seldom a problem , but among postmenopausal patients the number who yield no fluid runs as high as 50 percent . Since the risk of breast cancer increases with age ( about 90 percent of each year 's new cases occur in women 40 years and older ) , Sartorius ' critics claim his method has serious limitations . Sartorius himself is mindful of those limitations , but he believes he has found ways to bypass them . When he has nor been able to extract fluid from a patient he inserts a flexible nylon catheter , one eight-thousandths of an inch in diam-  | eter , into the duct opening and , using a specially designed surgical microscope , threads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painless ; a wornan feels , at most , a momentary " sting . " ) Next , a sterile saline solution carried through the catheter " washes out " the duct cells . Because this is a more timeconsuming and painstaking process than simple aspiration , Sartorius says it will be used only for high-risk patientsthose with previous malignancies or with a family history of cancer . Once the duct fluid is collected it is put through a " monolayer " filter that makes it possible for the cytologist to examine each single cell . To understand why that is important , it 's necessary to know the basics of how cancer cells develop in the breast . Most breast cancers , experts believe , originate in a duct . At first , cells increase in number , or tend to clump together . This condition is called hyperplasia and there is usually nothing abnormal about it . But sometimes hyperplastic cells become startlingly atypical ? and go on to become cancerous . As they grow and multiply , they eventually break through the duct wall and invade other parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rest of the body . If malignant cells are found in duct fluid , Sartorius next collects fluid separately from each individual duct ? via the nylon catheter method ? to identify their source . Then he injects a radioopaque dye through the catheter and takes X-rays . This procedure ( contrast mammography ) yields an unusually sharp picture , much clearer and more detailed than an ordinary mammogram . As a result , Sartorius can pinpoint the exact location of a malignancy . He then inserts a " marker " of sterile black surgical thread into the duct . " The marker tells me exactly where to take a biopsy for the pathologist , " he says . " It makes surgery simpler and quicker . " Although , as we have seen , early cell analysis may be our best defense against breast cancer , it does not mean that surgery can be avoided . No doctor can ever be certain that even an in situ cancer ( a technical term for one that does n't appear to have spread ) has not already seeded some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be what Sartorius calls " multifocal . " " In my opinion , " he says , " if you find malignant cells in one place the odds are extremely high that they are present somewhere else in the breast , too . " Several women who , like Mrs. Ryan , had early cancers diagnosed by the Sartorius method told me : ? In a small California town , a vivacious businesswoman in her mid-forties had no sign or suspicion of cancer . But she was actively involved with a civic club 's anticancer campaign , and thought it would be a good idea if she went through the diagnostic process at Sartorius ' clinic . He found an early invasive cancer which required a modified radical mastectomy . " I hate to think what could have happened if I 'd waited another year for my next checkup , " the woman said . ? A 52-year-old psychologist , who worked at a Los Angeles breast clinic as a counselor , decided she herself should have a cancer checkup . Her doctor found no lumps ; her mammograms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional visit to Sartorius ' clinic , she volunteered for cell analysis so she could know what the procedure was like . Sartorius found cancerous cells in a duct . Because of their grade and location , they required only a simple mastectomy . ? Every few months for five years a woman in her late fifties went to her doctor to have fluid drained from a large benign cyst in her breast . Eventually she grew concerned about the situation ? the cyst always filled up again ? and came to Sartorius . He found an invasive cancer which was right behind the cyst and had been masked from both mammogram and thermogram by it . " If we 'd been able to examine the fluid that had 141  | been discarded all those years , " Sartorius observed , " we might have been able to find the cancer early enough to avoid a radical mastectomy . " The doctor hopes that early diagnosis may ultimately make less-radical surgery possible , at least some of the time . Take , for example , a hypothetical young woman who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the disease , and whose own duct cells exhibit a typical hyperplasia , a strong hint of the beginning of trouble . Sartorius believes that it may be feasible , in such a case , to perform a " subcutaneous " mastectomy ? taking out all the breast tissue under the skin and nipple and replacing it with a silastic gel implant . " The woman will look and feel the same , " he says , " but she will be relieved of the burden of frequent and repeated checkups , and the anxiety over the possibility of developing a breast cancer . " Medicine is a traditionally conservative profession , rightfully cautious about new approaches until they are proven beyond all doubt . Moreover , new developments in the fight against breast cancer are sometimes overstated and often announced prematurely . Sartorius ' work , therefore , has been met with both hopeful interest and sharp questioning on the part of his colleagues . Recently , Dr. Sartorius became one of several researchers to work on breastfluid cytology under a grant of $175,000 from the National Cancer Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new techniques , " says Dr. Ihor Masnyk , project officer in charge of the grant . " Dr. Sartorius ' work has the potential for important progress in early detection of breast cancer . " Dr. Masnyk adds , " It will probably be most important for women under 40 . In younger breasts , the tissues are often too dense for palpation to be effective . Thermography yields many false positives . And ? although breast X-rays do n't give off any more radiation than dental X-rays ? there is some concern about repeated exposure to mammograms for women still in the childbearing years . " Dr. Arthur Holleb , medical director of the American Cancer Society , says ACS is " following Dr. Sartorius ' work with interest and anticipating his report of scientific results . Early detection is the key to survival , and we are hopeful of any progress to this end . " The chief criticisms of Sartorius ' findings fall into three main areas . One is that , at this writing , he has not yet published a definitive report on his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says that several papers including complete statistical data have now been submitted for publication . He also says that he has lectured on his findings at several ACS meetings , and in September 1974 spoke on " The Early Detection of Breast Cancer " at a UCLA symposium for mammographers and radiologists . A colleague , Dr. Nicholas Petrakis of the University of California at San Francisco , has reported frequently on cell analysis to professional groups , including the NCI Breast Cancer Task Force in October . Secondly , some experts question the comparatively high rate of malignancies Sartorius is finding ? one in 200 compared to an average of one in 1,000 detected by mammograms . Some feel that these statistics ? along with the implication that Sartorius can find cancers when other doctors ca n't ? will alarm women . Sartorius himself readily admits that his figures are high because he works with many high-risk women , and that if his patients were chosen at random his cancer-discovery rate would be lower . But the fact remains that Sartorius is finding cancers that can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks to cytology , malignancies are being discovered years before they would become palpable as a lump , or even show up on a standard mammogram . According to Sartorius , almost all of the cancers he has detected by cell analysis are far smaller than one centimeter ( about a third of an inch ) in diameter , which is the average size of a lump that a doctor can find by touch . In effect , he says , cytology finds malignancies at such an early stage that they would not otherwise become part of the cancer statistic for another five to eight years . A third reservation some experts have about the Sartorius method concerns the extent to which it can be adapted to mass screening . They point to the cancers that originate in the breast but outside of the ducts . Some experts criticize the technique as too time-consuming , too difficult , and/or not applicable to enough women . " Most of those who make this criticism , " observes the NCI 's Dr. Masnyk , " are those who can not extract enough fluid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others who train and work with him , can do this . " Nevertheless , as with any new diagnostic technique , it may take time before breast-cell analysis will be widely available , and it will be an extra ? although modest ? diagnostic cost to patients . Doctors must be trained in the aspiration technique , and encouraged to make it part of their routine examination . Many more technicians trained in breast-cell cytology will be needed . Pathologists , who are expert at recognizing cancer in tissues , will have to become adept at spotting it in single cells . ( For these reasons , cell analysis is ? with one exception ? not being used routinely at any of the 27 ACS-NCI screening centers that have recently been opened across the nation . Says Dr. Masnyk , " Basically , the centers hope to encourage more women to get regular checkups , which should include mammograms . These are the best diagnostic tests we now have . " The one center where breast-cell analysis is being used as an official addition to the regular screening program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Since Otto Sartorius is aware that other medical men must be able to duplicate his work before his claims can be validated , he is encouraged by the fact that several major health centers have now undertaken the task . Breastcell analysis is now being used on a broad scale at Detroit 's Michigan Cancer Foundation ( 7,000 patients a year ) ; at the Medical School of the University of California at Los Angeles ; and at the Medical Center of the University of California at San Francisco . Ultimately , Sartorius believes , his method holds the promise of providing a valid breakthrough in the earliest possible diagnosis of breast cancer . He knows that even if his findings are fully confirmed , it may still be many years for his technique to be widely accepted and widely used . But he is convinced that the time will come when it offers the best chance to save women 's lives . DEFINITIONS OF TERMS imography ?
