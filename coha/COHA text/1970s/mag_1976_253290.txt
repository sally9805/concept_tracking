The following Bicentennial Essay is the seventh in a series that has been appearing periodically , surveying how America has changed in its 200 years . On the eve of the Revolutionary War , many colonists-and not only Tories-feared that if rebellion came , " the bands of society would be dissolved , the harmony of the world confounded , and the order of nature subverted . " Crime and lawlessness would surely accompany any challenge to authority , especially one involving a resort to arms . <P> It did not happen-not , at least , during the war . In retrospect , that is remarkable . In 1776 there were no municipal police forces and almost no prisons . If a person was the victim of a crime , he would have to find and even apprehend the offender himself . There were sheriffs who could and did make arrests , but only on the basis of warrants issued by courts ; there was no provision for arrest on " probable cause , " and if a sheriff acted as if there were , he was liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial by jury , but the jury , unlike today 's juries , could settle questions of law as well as ones of fact . It was not unusual in those tumultuous days for a person charged with a crime to face a jury composed of sympathetic friends who were quite prepared to ignore a judge 's instructions and acquit the accused even though the law and the facts were plainly against him . <P> Mob action was so common and in the eyes of many so legitimate as to constitute , by 1776 , a conventional method of political action . The Boston Tea Party was hardly an isolated case : the mob also rioted to keep food from being shipped out of the colony during lean times , to prevent men from being impressed into the British navy , and to halt the collection of unpopular customs duties . The men who made up these mobs were , as likely as not , also the men to be found sitting in New England town meetings and on local juries . <P> Accordingly , these were not mobs in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun or profit . As University of Massachusetts Historian Pauline Maier has written : " The Boston mob was so domesticated that it refused to riot on Saturday and Sunday nights , which were considered holy by New Englanders . " Indeed , often the " mob " served quite legal ends , as when the hue and cry was set up to apprehend a thief , or when measures had to be taken to deal with public health problems . Small wonder , then , that a member of a mob was rarely convicted for his riotous actions . In the 20th century we have become accustomed to seeing theft and looting accompany mob action , but surprisingly that association did not exist in the 18th century . <P> <P> Crime not only did not increase during the Revolutionary War , but most of it , at least in New England , continued to involve religious and moral , not acquisitive or violent , offenses . William E. Nelson , analyzing the records of seven populous Massachusetts counties , finds an average of 23 prosecutions for theft each year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1776 , hardly indicative of a crime wave . But there was an average of 72 prosecutions for sexual offenses each year before 1776 and 58 a year from 1779 to 1786 , along with about 24 prosecutions a year for religious offenses , like missing church on Sunday .
