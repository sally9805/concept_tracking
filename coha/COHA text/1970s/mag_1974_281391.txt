As if to ensure the survival of some species over long periods of drought and temperature extremes , nature has produced organisms that can exist many years in suspended animation . Last week two scientists announced that in soil samples taken from deep below the surface of Antarctica , they found frozen bacteria that may be anywhere from 10,000 to 1 million years old . When incubated , some of the bacteria not only returned to life but also reproduced . <P> Microbiologists Roy Cameron and Frank Morelli made their discovery by accident . The researchers , now at the Darwin Research Institute in Dana Point , Calif. , had been working for the past three years on a project aimed at evaluating the environmental impact of deep drilling on Antarctica . As part of their work , they regularly analyzed the material brought up by the drills to determine what surface contaminants had seeped into the soil . Some experiments conducted on cores taken from layers of soil , rock and ice that had been laid down between 10,000 and 1 million years ago produced startling results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a depth of 1,260 ft. - contained rod-shaped bacteria of a type not encountered in previous testing . Another , brought up in an area called New Harbor from a depth of 280 ft. , carried club-shaped microbes . <P> Heat Shock . Following their normal procedure , the researchers sterilized the exterior of the core samples with a blowtorch , then used a sterile drill to remove sections containing the bacteria . Their precautions produced an unexpected side effect . When they examined chips from the Ross Island core under a microscope , they found that microbes were moving around . " We may have heat-shocked them out of dormancy , " says Cameron . Placed in a nutrient broth , the rod-shaped bacteria continued to move about . The club-shaped organisms proved even more responsive . On a culture plate , they reproduced and set up colonies that looked to Cameron like " inactive volcanoes . " <P> Neither Cameron nor Morelli is willing to claim categorically that their bacteria are the world 's oldest living organisms . But if the ancient origin of the bacteria is finally established , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mars . Even if the Viking Landers , which are scheduled to visit Mars in 1976 , find no evidence of life on the planet 's dry and frigid terrain , the Antarctic discovery holds out hope that living organisms-perhaps dormant-might still exist beneath the Martian surface .
