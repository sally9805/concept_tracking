THE NEW TORNi IV i1 i115 THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment A the Senate was voting to delay enactment of one of President Ford 's energy proposals last week , we sat down to try to puzzle out the logic of the Administration 's economic program as a whole . In purely economic terms , as many observers have argued , the policy cancels itself out , or even has harmful effects . On the one hand , the tax rebate of some billions of dollars would increase the public 's spending power , while on the . other hand the rise in oil prices caused by new taxes would decrease the public 's spending power . The net result for the economy would he inflationary pressure without the stimulating effects of a rise in buying . The only beneficial aim is the conservation of energy : a reduction in the use of fuel , and a reduction in imports of oil . The President 's " economic " policy seems to emerge as a conservation policy to he paid for with economic sacrifices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For , as many observers have also pointed out , the reduction attainable by the President 's oil policy would fall far short of breaking America 's dependency on imported oil . It is a long way from being anything like a Project Independence , or even the plausible beginning of one . In fact , government planners have yet to come up with any workable plan that would make the United States independent in energy in the near future . Pared down to its final consequences , then , the President 's policy offers only a less tangible result : a display of resoluteness  --  the appearance , but nor the substance , of effective conservationist action . As Secretary of State Henry Kissinger put it a few weeks ago in the course of arguing for an energy policy that would permanently prevent the price of imported oil from returning to its very low , pre-embargo level in order to encourage domestic investment in the search for alternative sources of energy , " It is the glory of our nationthat when challenged we have always stepped forward with spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to do so again , and in so doing to reaffirm to ourselves and to the world that this generation of Americans has the integrity of character to carry on the noble experiment that began two centuries ago . " Mr. Kissinger has frequently been a strong advocate of actions and statements that , while perhaps not attaining any concrete ends in themselves , demonstrate America 's resolute intentions to its adversaries . His Vietnam policy was rooted in calculations of this sort , and recently we have had his mention of the possibility of using force in the Middle East , and the dispatch of the aircraft carrier Enterprise to the Indian Ocean . In a recent article in the Washington Post , titled " Force and Diplomacy , " Barry Blechman , of the Brookings Institution , wrote , " Through an array of verbal , diplomatic , and military instruments , the United States sent a tough message to the Arab oil-producers : tinder certain circumstances , this nation would utilize its armed forces to end an oil-embargo . " And he concluded , " By deterring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor military and diplomatic demonstration may have preserved progress toward peace in the Middle East , thus helping to avoid contingencies with real dangers for wider conflict . " If the Kissinger threat of force was a military and diplomatic " demonstration " of resoluteness  --  aimed at the Arabs  --  then it stands to reason that the President 's energy policy may well he an economic demonstration of resoluteness aimed in the same direction . It may have been decided that just as a demonstration of force might obviate the use of force , so a demonstration of economic sacrifice might obviate the need for a full-hedged Project Independence . If this is the logic of the policy , then the policy was misnamed . It is not an economic policy but a foreign policy . In fact , in terms of the foreign-policy objective of letting the oil producers know just how serious we are , the unfortunate economic consequences we endure may be helpful , since a demonstration is more convincing when it is hacked by sacrifices . In Vietnam , the sacrifice was tens of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the nation 's economic health . The people who are losing their jobs and paying higher prices do n't know it , but the whole new system proposed by the Ford . Administration , with its fees and its rebates and its circular flow of billions of dollars throughout the American economy , may be not a program at all but a message  --  a move in the diplomatic , not the economic , game . ? ? Light-Consclousness UP in Cambridge , Massachusetts , Henry Kloss is doing for television what his Brattle Street neighbor Edwin H. Land has done for photography . Every week , Kloss 's factory , over in the M.I.T. area , produces a hundred VideoBeani 1000-A 's . The VideoBeam 1000-A , his new invention , is a color-television set that " Do n't you love today 's look ? Everything goes with everything . " ? ? comes in two parts . One is a threefoot-high projection unit , with familiar TV knobs on its top  --  tint , brightness , contrast , horizontal hold , channel selector , on-off . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a quiet whir , but you can hear the fan only when the high-fidelity speakers in the unit are turned way down low . The other part of 1000-A is a TV screen four and a quarter feet high and five and two-thirds feet wide . Just about the size of a hockey goal . Ordinary- TV sets are sold in diagonal widths ; that is , a twelve-inch screen measures twelve inches from the lower-left-hand corner of the screen to the upper-right-hand corner of the screen . By these measurements , the VideoBeam has an eighty-five-inch screen . That 's just over seven feet . The VideoBeam screen is concave in two directions . All four corners , in other words , bend toward the viewer . The surface of the screen is made of aluminum foil that looks like the reverse side of broiler-grade aluminum foil . The back of the screen is made of molded foam plastic , and from behind the screen looks a little like a radar screen . The screen sits eight feet away from the projection unit , which has three projectors  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green one . When the three images arc superimposed on the screen , they produce a color picture of startling clarity and brightness . Henry Kloss says he could have made a black-and-white Video-Beam but that for his money blackand-white is like camping out . To operate the VideoBeam 1000-A , you hook it up to an aerial , plug it into the wall , and turn it on . It warms up in fifteen to twenty seconds , and operates on a hundred and sixty watts . It costs two thousand seven hundred and ninety-five dollars , and its two parts occupy about as much space as a grand piano or a Ping-Pong table . Henry Kloss is forty-six years old . He is one of the Cambridge geniuses , a small but recognizable group . At his office , he dresses fifties casual  --  open-neck blue button-down shirt , chinos , narrow black belt , Hush Puppies . His gray hair is short in front , long in hack a Kunst-ler cut . He was born in Tyrone , Pennsylvania , a small town near Altoona ; came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; became the K MARCH 3 , 19 7 5 in KLH , one of the first manufacturers of high-fidelity record-players ; reluctantly went along when L and H wanted to sell the firm to the Singer Company ; founded and is now president of Advent , a company that makes speakers , stereo-cassette decks , and external-noise-reduction units  --  known as Dolby boxes  --  for hi-fi sets . About eight years ago , it occurred to Kloss to investigate the subject of TV . He watched TV only a few hours a week , but he wanted to get as much out of those hours as possible . So he bought a Heathkit color-TV kit , put it together , bought some good TV-studio monitor equipment , and eventually said to himself : ( A ) it is technically possible to construct a TV that can produce a picture ten times the size of my set and still have an interesting brightness ; ( B ) that 's the kind of thing I 'd like to have in my house . He spent the next six years , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So far , not many homes have Video-Beams . A few Cambridge and near-Cambridge bars have purchased them . The other night , we stopped in at Studley 's , a bar on Washington Street , for a look at their 1000-A . It was late , and the 1000-A sat by itself in a darkened corner screening an antismoking commercial . We plonked ourself down in front of it . Commercials are amazing on a VideoBeam 1000-A , and very funny . Pitches designed to really do a job on you when viewed on a twelve-inch screen lose their punch on an eighty-five-inch screen . Too much reality . You can see that those people do n't care whether you stop smoking or not . The next day , we met Henry Kloss at his showroom , which is in back of the factory . Reached by an outside staircase . Invisible from the street . He ran a few video-cassette tapes on a display-model 1000-A . Microphotographs of unicellular creatures , taken from a National Grographic special , were breathtaking . You just sit and look at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set to regular programming . We saw a baby-lotion cornmercial . " Look ! " said Kloss . " Look , there 's a fly in that commercial . A fly flying around one of the babies . You 'd never see that on a conventional set . " Floss said that the secret of his machine is a very effective use of light . This is how he gets a bright picture on less electricity than a two-hundredwatt bulb uses . And he said his product also happens to be the first hi-fi TV set . " KLH  --  the hi-fi industry , in fact  --  got started twenty years ago because the big manufacturers were making record-players that were worse than they had to be , " Klass said . " A lot of the information contained on records  --  a tot of the sound was being lost . Small companies like KLH started the process of jarring up the business , and now it 's not hard to gct a good record-player . This process has n't happened yet in TV . The same big companies that make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The quality of the picture transmitted by TV stations is far higher than what 's picked up on the little screens made by conventional manufacturers . My machine is expensive , but it 's designed for home use , even though it 's helping bars a lot at the moment . Let 's see what the next twenty years bring , " One thing that tickles Henry Kloss is that the security guards who watch over the home of his neighbor Edwin H. Land sometimes peer into Heniy Moss 's living-room window to look at his VideoBeam 1 0 00-A . Entertainer THERE are no slot machines in the lobby of the Waldorf-Astoria , and that 's probably bad news for Lovelace Wa t kin s , since his act is apparently designed to be performed in close proximity to them , Out in Vegas  --  or Las Vegas , as we prefer to call it  --  Lovelace Watkins is going to be big , really tremendous , if he is n't already . The Empire Room of the Waldorf is not un-Nevadan in the golden garishness of its decor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York simply is not Las Vegas . No getting around that . Lovelace Watkins is a Tom JonesEngeihert Humperdinck clone , a Donny Osmond surrogate for the biologically mature . In this connection , the fact that he is an American Creole is wholly irrelevant . He is one of those large-voiced singers of popular songs who always seem to have on a silk calypso shirt open to the navel , no matter what they are actually wearing . He has done very well on the other side of the Atlantic . He recently completed an engagement at the crassest night club in London , a place called ( we think we 've got this right ) The Talk of the Town , and the London Sunday Mirror , reviewing his performance , called him " the greatest cabaret entertainer in the world . " For his opening at the Empire Room , the Waldorf management went to a certain amount of trouble  --  kliegs out front of the hotel , a purple " Lovelace Watkins " banner flying from the flagstaff , numerous flash-equipped photographers . The photographers took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her entrance three times . When Lovelace Watkins made his entrance , on the Empire Room stage , he took immediate measures to establish himself as a great entertainer . He made eye contact with several members of the audience , strode masterfully hack and forth , and launched right into his first song ( " What the World Needs Now Is Love " ) in a powerful baritone voice . He was wearing a double-breasted tuxedo , a tie-dyed orangeand-black scarf , and a turquoise ring the size of a golf ball . He had blond hair . By the time he had entertained his way through " ' This Is My Life , " " He Ai n't Heavy , He 's My Brother , " and " The Way We Were , " he had got rid of the jacket and scarf to reveal the calypso shirt and the perhaps equally inevitable gold medallion on a chain . The turquoise ring stayed . Lovelace Watkins ' between-songs patter relied heavily on the kind of sentimentality that it would be uncharitable to regard as sincere . " All I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act important , not to try to act like Mr. Big Man , but to try to reach some people , " he said . And , " Think of how great this world could be with people reaching out for each other . " There was something familiar about his speaking voice . We closed our eyes and listened hard , until we came up with the answer : Elisha Cook , Jr. , the gunsel in " The Maltese Falcon . " Lovelace ' Watkins had three gimmicks . Two of them showed mixed results ; the third was an unqualified success . The first was a high-pitched giggle , which may have been not a gimmick at all but an actual personal mannerism . The giggle was disconcerting , because it contrasted so vividly with the masterful striding and the blather about reaching out to people . For the same reason , it was finally winning . Lovelace Watkins ' second gimmick involved dragging a member of the audience up onstage to help sing the chorus of " Hey Jude . " The volunteer in question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but acquitted himself well . He even essayed a tentative twirl of the microphone . Then Lovelace Watkins asked the man his name , so that the crowd could give him a big hand , but the man refused to say anything except " I do n't know . " The trouble was , Lovelace Watkins had some follow-up patter that depended upon addressing his remarks by name to the man , who was presumably to stand for the audience as whole . Lovelace Watkins forged ahead gamely . His tone grave , he said , " When I was asked to give the royal command performance in England , Mr. I Do n't Know , I asked myself what I could sing for royalty , " and so on . Lovelace Watkins unveiled his third gimmick at the very end of his act . The song itself was unmemorable , but the refrain was " I love you so . " He sang these words into the microphone a few times , and then he threw away the microphone and sang them again and again , unamplified . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an unamplified human voice in a night club was shocking at first , and then moving . Lovelace Watkins understood this , and it earned him an ovation . Contests THE crowd that gathered in the Grand Ballroom of the New York Hilton one recent night to attend the Model of the Year Pageant ( " New York City 's Only National Beauty Contest " ) included two conspicuous groups of people : cnit-oftowners and locals . The out-of-towners were the relatives of the contestants , young women who had been recruited for the pageant from all over the country  --  a few from Palm Springs , San Francisco , and Dallas , but the majority from places like Altus , Oklahoma ; Lookout Mountain , Tennessee ; and Sand Coulee , Montana . The out-of-town fathers and uncles made fun of each other 's tuxedos , but they seemed to have a wonderful time . Among the women locals , most of whom were escorted by sharp-featured , " dry look " young men , there were three look-alike types : the Cyhill Shepherds , the Carole Lombards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Year for 1968 , so more women tried to imitate her than anyone else . ) The contestants appeared more  --  well , wholesome . Each time Laura Grills , of Grand Blanc , Michigan , strolled down the runway , her father , Robert Grills , took several photographs of her . The flash unit on his Instamatic camera had a three-inch extension , and Mr. Grills popped away diligently to make sure he caught all of Laura , who is nineteen years old and five feet eleven inches tall . One time when Laura went by , Oleg Cassini , the fashion designer , who was acting as m.c. , failed to announce her name . In fact , Mr. Cassini either overlooked or mispronounced the name of virtually every contestant at least once during the evening . Although his lapses failed to bother him , they did bother Laura 's mother , Jean Grills , who  --  also could n't understand why Mr , Cassini insisted on pronouncing Grand Blanc " Cron Blonk . " The Model of the Year Pageant had most of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the orchestra played an overture that included " Manhattan " and " This Could Be the Start of Something , " thc arriving spectators decorously kissed cheekto-cheek , and an enormous chandelier in the shape of an eight-pointed star hovered above the stage . Most of the clothes worn by the contestants were designed by Mr. Cassini , who offered a play-by-play commentary punctuated with unremarkable sin gie-ente nd res . For one part of the competition , the contestants wore evening dresses of their own creation . Carol Edwards , of Flat Rock , North Carolina , was named Model of the Year for 1975 , which made her very happy , because the victory means a minimum guarantee of twenty-five thousand dollars in earnings during her first year of modelling . The first and second runners-up received guarantees of fifteen and ten thousand dollars , respectively . Three other girls were chosen by a man named John Casahlancas , owner of three Paris modelling agencies , to go to Paris to model . After Carol Edwards was crowned , she took a victory stroll , and then all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Party of the Year followed the pageant . There we tried to have a conversation with Linda Tonge , Model of the Year for 1974 , but we were interrupted by a young man in black tie and kilts . THE best riddle we 've heard in a long while entered the public domain when Bobby Safian , of West Eighty-ninth Street , competed in the elementary-school division of the Joke Day in New York contest at Town Hall last Saturday . Here is Bobby 's riddle : Q : What did the French engineer say after the train accident ? A : Toulouse-Lautrec . For his trouble , Bobby won a nip for four to Washington , D.C. , which he will presumably make with members of his family , including Tommy , his younger brother . Tommy did n't enter the contest , but he did ask us the following riddle : Q : There was a Mr. Bigger and he had a son . Who was bigger ? A : The son was a little Bigger . The difference between Bobby 's ? ? joke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his up . This explains why Bobby told his onstage at Town Hall and walked off with the big marbles , while Tommy was relegated to reciting his riddle in private , between bites of a large pickle . Joke Day , it turns out , was sponsored by the New York City Department of Recreation and Vlasic Foods , Inc. , which together gave away three family trips to Washington , three ten-speed bicycles , twelve dinners at the restaurant of a very fancy New York hotel , and six year-long supplies of pickles , plus all the hot dogs and pickles anyone could stand to eat on the premises . The pickle people also made certain that no one walked away without a copy of " Bob Vlasic 's 101 Pickle Jokes . " ( " Q : Vhat 's the first line of the pickle wedding ceremony ? A : ' Dilly Beloved , we are gathered together ... ' " ) Don Imus , the disc jockey and comedian , m.c. ' d this affair , and although he was in a rather prickly mood when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the children he met . One of the problems with Joke Day was that we had to endure a two-hour stretch of grown-up performers before the joke-telIing contest began . The most entertaining grownup was Zomar the Great , who does a balancing act that would make Philippe Petit envious . Rather than balancing his body upon things , Zomar balances things upon himself  --  specifically , upon his chin . He has a cleft chin . Zomar the Great is a thirty-eight-year-old black man who used to answer to the name Marvin Parks before he went into the balancing business . He was billed seventh in the Joke Day lineup , following Ed McMahon , who told a lot of stories about his dieting experience and made fun of Johnny Carson . Zomar 's act requires many accessories , including a baton , a battle-axe , a ladder , folding chairs , and a Lawnmower . First , he twirled the baton a few times , and then he tilted his head backward and placed the baton on his chin . It stood erect , and the crowd applauded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even walked a few steps up a fifteen-foot ladder with the axe in place . Then he began to work with the folding chairs . First , he balanced one by its leg on his chin , then two , three , four , and five . After the fifth chair , he took a breather and chinned a push-type lawnmower made it look like a snap ? and then prepared for the sixth folding chair . He had a bit of trouble locking it into the stack of five , and Lisa Parker , who was seated in front of us , said , " It 'll be a great balancing act if he can just get the sixth chair on top of the others . " While Zomar chinned the sixth chair , but before his climactic feat  --  balancing the ladder on his chin ! ? we spoke with Lisa , who wears glasses and has long black braids and had on a purple shirt and a blue vest with leather fringes . We asked her , among other things , how old she is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " we asked . " You seem very mature . " Lisa smiled and explained , " That 's because I 'm almost ten . "
