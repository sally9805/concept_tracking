He will be 70 next month , has no previous political experience , raised far less money than his main rivals , could not afford television commercials , has a rambling speaking style , and sometimes seems so becalmed that he is said to wink by opening one eye . Because such conventional debits count for little in this eccentric campaign year , S.I . ( for Samuel Ichiye ) Hayakawa last week won the Republican Senate nomination in California . <P> It was no squeak-through victory against a patsy , either . Running against three serious opponents , Hayakawa achieved a comfortable eleven-point plurality over Robert Finch , 50 , his principal adversary . Finch , once a close friend of Richard Nixon 's , was California 's top vote getter ten years ago when he won the lieutenant governorship . Later he served as Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare in the Nixon Administration . <P> There was little difference between the candidates ' campaign pitches-both followed mildly conservative lines-and the rivals agreed in explaining the results . " I was n't really surprised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disillusionment with politics helped me . I have no lOUs to the political buddy system . " <P> Hayakawa does candidly acknowledge his debt to the student riots of the late ' 60s . A semanticist with an excellent reputation among academics , Hayakawa was approaching retirement age in 1968 when he was made acting president of San Francisco State College . The school had been sundered by violent demonstrations . Short , normally mild of mien and sporting a tam-o ' - shanter , Hayakawa became an instant celebrity when he summoned riot police to the campus and suppressed the radical uprising . At one point the scholar personally ripped the wires from the protesters ' public address system in mid-diatribe . Today he says : " I had to become an effective college president in five minutes . I 'm still living off the television time I got in 1968 , 1969 and 1970 . " <P> In quelling the troublemakers and reopening the school , Hayakawa became something of a hero to conservatives and was appointed San Francisco State 's regular president . His entry into Republican politics was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a flaw that he did not remedy until three years ago . <P> Japanese Analogy . Republican voters this year seemed unconcerned by his late coming to their party . If Hayakawa 's campaign rhetoric was less than sensational , Finch 's was downright dull . Hayakawa answered questions about his age with an allusion to his ancestral homeland : " Before World War II in Japan they killed off all the older politicians . All that were left were the damn fools who attacked Pearl Harbor . I think that this country needs elder statesmen too . " If that rather strained analogy does not help , the age issue is reduced by the fact that he still tap-dances and fences . <P> While the Republicans were willing to accept a quirky non-pol , Democratic voters chose the competent if bland alternative . They renominated Incumbent John Tunney , 41 , who withstood a rough challenge from Tom Hayden , once the kind of radical youth leader warred upon by Hayakawa.                   @ @
