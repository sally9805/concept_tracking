Many of the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania remain unchanged from colonial times , and when Liberal Democratic Governor Milton Shapp was elected two years ago , he promised sweeping reform . He reckoned without the strength of a revitalized conservative coalition in the state legislature , consisting of more than 100 Roman Catholics in both houses , mostly from urban and suburban areas , aided by like-minded rural legislators . Working together , the two groups represent a formidable constituency : Pennsylvania has four million Catholic residents and the highest rural population in the nation . The Governor also reckoned without State Representative Martin P. Mullen , 51 , an archconservative Philadelphia Catholic , veteran of ten two-year terms and the head of the powerful house appropriations committee . <P> Mullen , backed by equally conservative John Cardinal Krol and his Pennsylvania Catholic Conference , decided that the state , with its 35% Catholic population , was natural terrain to make a stand against the trend to more liberal laws on public morality . The battle was joined over the issue of abortion . To counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own that outlawed abortion altogether except when a panel of three physicians certified that the mother 's life was endangered . It made no allowance for victims of rape , incest or mental illness . Supporting the conservative bill , the Catholic Conference ran a long and costly campaign that included weekly pictures of truncated fetuses and aborted embryos on Page One of the Cathotic Standard &; Times , the official organ of the archdiocese of Philadelphia . Last June the campaign paid off : the liberal bill was easily defeated , and the conservative bill was adopted by both houses and sent to Shapp for his signature . Mullen warned the Governor that if he attempted to stop the bill through veto or pocket veto he would run against him in the Democratic primary next year . <P> While Shapp mulled over what to do , the protest and counterprotest boiled on . In an unusual turn , Patricia Arney , 32 , a divorcee who is a district Democratic committeewoman , revealed to the Philadelphia Inquirer that State Senator Henry J. Cianfrani , 49 , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her abortion in 1970 while they were having an affair , and produced a receipt for his check to prove it . He did not deny their relationship , but said that he had given her the money to visit her family in Toledo and did not know that there had been an abortion . Though the disclosure caused yowls of protest on the floor of the state senate , letters to the Inquirer ran 10 to 1 in favor of Arney 's blow against hypocrites . <P> Last week Shapp , calling the bill " unsound , unenforceable and totally unfair , " vetoed it . Mullen failed to muster the three-fourths majority necessary to override the veto , leaving the state functionally without an abortion law of any kind , since lower courts have declared the present statute unconstitutionally vague and appeals are pending . With that , Mullen sounded the charge for his race against Shapp next spring , which could be among the bitterest elections in Pennsylvania 's history : he called the Governor 's veto the result of a " paganistic , atheistic philosophy .
