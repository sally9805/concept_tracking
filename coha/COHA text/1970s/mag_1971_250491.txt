WITH the awesome fury of a cyclone off the Bay of Bengal , civil war swept across East Pakistan last week . In city after crowded , dusty city the army turned its guns on mobs of rioting civilians . Casualties mounted into the thousands . Though the full toll remained uncertain because of censorship and disorganization in the world 's most densely populated corner ( 1,400 people per sq . mi. ) , at week 's end some estimates had 2,000 dead . Even if President Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan is prepared to accept casualties of a geometrically greater magnitude , the outcome is likely to be the final breakup of East and West Pakistan and the painful birth of a new nation named Bangla Desh ( Bengal State ) . <P> The indistinct battle lines reflected the ethnic and cultural divisions that have beset Pakistan since its creation as a Moslem homeland when British India was partitioned in 1947 . Two predominantly Moslem areas that used to be part of India became a new country , the two parts separated by 1,000 miles of Indian territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand to keep order in East Pakistan last week , their supply bases were 1,000 miles away and most food and ammunition had to be carried 3,000 miles around the coast of India . The troops - mostly tall , fierce Punjabis and Pa-thans-were surrounded in East Pakistan by a hostile population of 78 million Bengalis .

But a resistance movement , once organized , might eventually force the West Pakistanis to depart . In a way , the struggle evoked haunting memories of the Nigerian civil war of 1967-70 , when the federal regime sought justification in the name of national unity and the Biafrans in the name of self-determination . <P> First Shot . Until last week , Pakistan 's political leaders seemed on the verge of settling their differences . Then , in rapid order , three events carried the nation over the brink of violence . In Chittagong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the first shots came from is unclear , but when the troops opened fire , 35 Bengalis were killed . Their political leader , Sheik Mujibur Rahman , called a general strike to protest . Then , Yahya Khan outlawed Mujib and his Awami League Party as " enemies of Pakistan " and ordered the armed forces to " do their duty . " <P> In Dacca , army tanks and truckloads of troops with fixed bayonets came clattering out of their suburban base , shouting " Victory to Allah , " and " Victory to Pakistan . " TIME Correspondent Dan Coggin , who , along with other newsmen , was subsequently expelled from Pakistan , reported : " Before long , howitzer , tank artillery and rocket blasts rocked half a dozen scattered sections of Dacca . Tracers arced over the darkened city . The staccato chatter of automatic weapons was punctuated with grenade explosions , and tall columns of black smoke towered over the city . In the night came the occasional cry of ' Joi Bangla Victory to Bengal , ' followed by a burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
