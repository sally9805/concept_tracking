" A formal announcement is when you do it in the Senate caucus room with your family at your side . I do n't know what to call this one . " With this characteristic bit of mock diffidence , Minnesota 's Eugene J. McCarthy revealed at a Boston news conference late last week that he was- " de facto , de jure " - again a candidate for the presidency . The poet , professor and paladin of politics also confirmed that he had assented to the establishment of a McCarthy-for-President committee in Massachusetts . <P> The ex-Senator , however , said that he had not yet decided whether to enter the Massachusetts primary in April . Vague as ever , McCarthy added : " This is the beginning of an effort to get delegates . I do n't know if you could call it a drive or not . " The McCarthy faithful have long awaited his political renascence-but other Democrats are hardly likely to welcome another divisive figure into the ranks of candidates .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
