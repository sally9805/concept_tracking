txt Senator Henry M. Jackson , the Washington Democrat , once labeled them " obscene , " President Carter has called them " excessive " and , according to opinion polls , . thany people believe they are plainly outrageous . But , despite the widely held opinion that the big oil companies ' profits are much too great , the findings of financial specialists , including those at several leading banks , almost uniformly indicate otherwise , according to interviews with many analysts . Bearing on Decontrol By the routine measures of how profitable an industry or company is , the oil industry 's earnings are no better than average , these financial specialists said . Oil profits are considered respectable but not unusual . But , more narrowly , the analysts also point out , if one puts aside the oil companies ' refinery operations , tankers and retail outlets and looks only at the business of finding and extracting oil , exceptional profits are in fact quite common . These observations have direct bearing on the decontrol of crude oil prices , which began last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the President 's proposed " windfall " profits tax . Decontrol , a 28-month phasing out of ceilings on crude oil prices , is meant to infuse the oil industry with more money to help finance the search for new domestic oil reserves . It will allow the producers to sell their present reserves of oil at higher prices and thereby increase their profits . But critics in Congress and elsewhere contend that decontrol is mainly a windfall for the companies . As they see it , the industry is already exploiting the current shortage , and they cite recent and dramatic advances in oil profits to make their point . In response , the President has repeatedly urged Congress to enact a surtax on the expanded profits to capture for the public coffers some of the gains that decontrol will provide . In interviews , financial analysts did not wholly agree with Mr. Carter , his critics or the industry . The specialists generally found oil profits not excessive , yet ample enough to bear an excess profits , or windfall , tax . And in apparently in ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea to pump billions in profits into further oil exploration . Oil profits are poorly understood , the analysts ' said , in good part because the public does not seem to distinguish profits from profitability . Profitability , a broader measure , is simply the relationship between the profits that a company or industry clears and the investment required to generate them . And on that ' score , the oil industry has generally trailed slightly behind most other industries , analysts say . " In no way do the oil industry 's profits result from excessive , abnormal or unfair rates of return , " insisted Jeffrey A. Nichols , president and chief economist for the Argus Research Corporation , a consulting company that does financial and economic research for a variety of clients . " Over the long term , the industry has been underperforming and , except for the period around 1973.74 , it continues to underperform . " Although the analysts interviewed , none of whom works for an oil company , conceded that overall oil profits did rocket to record levels five years ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry has had its share of setbacks as well . 12.5% Average Return Accorrung to a study soon to be released by the Bankers Trust Company , over the last five years the return on equity of the 25 top domestic oil companies averaged 12.5 percent . By contrast , it said , the return for all manufacturing companies has averaged 13.3 percent since 1974 . ( It is also true , however , that the oil companies did achieve an exceptional 17.5 percent return in 1974 , when the explosion in world oil prices began . ) Financial analysts generally consider return on equity , or net.worth , the best measure of profitability . ( A company 's equity is simply its assets minus its liabilities ) . The return on equity , which is the profit expressed as a percentage of the equity , is considered the purest gauge of bow much is being earned by the money tied up in the business . In simple terms , it is the equivalent of the interest rate paid on a consumer 's savings account . Comparing profit figures alone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only part of the picture . Missing , they assert , is the size of the investment required to bring in those profits . A $100 million company that earns $10 million a year is obviously doing better than a $1 billion enterprise that clears the same sum . Big Rises in Quarter The outcry over oil profits was fueled anew this spring when the major companies reported startling increases in firstquarter earnings . Exxon 's earnings were 37 percent higher than they were in last year 's first quarter ; Gulf 's leaped 61 percent , and both Mobil and Texaco reported increases of 81 percent . By comparison , the quarter brought Exxon 's return on investment to 15.4 percent a year ; Gulf 's , to 11.7 percent ; Mobil 's , 15.4 percent , and Texaco 's , only 10.5 percent . There are other ways to measure performance than return on investment , but few of the common financial ratios , if any , cast overall oil profits in a harsher light . One common ratio is profit margin , or a company 's profits divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example ; that the oil industry 's profit margin was 4.8 percent last year , up from 4.7 percent in 1977 . By contrast , the manufacturing sector as a whole averaged 5.2 percent , up from 5 percent . Profit margins vary widely from industry to industry , however . In the high-volume supermarket business , for instance , which requires relatively little expensive investment , a margin of less than 2 percent is quite respectable , even though it would be considered abysmal in most other businesses . Effect of Decontrol At issue , now , however , is not simply what the profits in the oil business have been , but also what decontrol will do to them in the years ahead , particularly in exploration and production . The financial analysts are by no means unanimous on that score . Some contend that the industry 's earnings are already more than adequate to attract capital and , further , that higher profits could lead to wasteful uses of scarce investment funds . Even so , they questioned whether a " windfall " profits tax was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decontrol . Even without a new profits tax , they say , decontrol will expand not only the industry 's earnings but also the income taxes , severance taxes and royalties that Federal and state governments collect from the companies . ' Still others question whether the decontrol program will really increase production as much as the President has indicated . Most within this group recommended that price ceilings be raised on " old " oil , which includes most of the production from wells discovered before 1973 , at least enough to offset the Inflation of the last five years . But they questioned whether controls should be removed on " upper tier " oil : the crude oil discovered since that time . Impetus for Searching Their argument : If price ceilings are removed from the price of oil still to be discovered , that alone would prompt the industry to search out new reserves at a stepped-up pace . To force-feed this effort by completely decontrolling the price of existing oil supplies as well would set off a wasteful scramble . The oil industry generally contends that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , as this line of argument runs , that would amount to ecomomic overkill . It is also clear that the heart of the oil business ? finding and extracting oil ? has been unusually profitable .
