txt Gen. Alexander M. Haig once explained why soldiers and politicians are brothers under the skin . " It 's only a soldier who can respect and admire a politician , " he told a reporter late last year ? at a time when tr . Haig himself was inside the bunker as chief of staff of the embattled Nixon White House . Politics , he said , is " a field where a man lays everything on the line to win or lose . . . . When one does n't win the results are fatal .. . . " Alexander Haig laid it all on the line for Richard Nixon . But instead of suffering fatal consequences , Mr. Haig seems about to rise from the wreckage of the Nixon presidency into some new position of military prominence , thanks to President Ford . And that probability is stirring lots of controversy here . In May 1973 , President Nixon summoned Mr. Haig , a four-star general , from the Pentagon to replace the discredited H. R. Haldeman as White House staff chief . The general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with a growing sense of foreboding , that throughout the remaining days of the Watergate scandal he gave his complete loyalty to President Nixon . The " Sinister Force " Perhaps . But what is for sure is that Gen. Haig is the man who ordered William D. Ruckelshaus to follow an order from " your commander in chief " to fire Archibald Cox as Watergate prosecutor . It was Gen. Haig who later floated stories about Elliot Richardson 's alleged drinking problem . It was he who suggested to Judge John J. Sirica that " some sinister - force " had erased a crucial Watergate tape . It was Gen. Haig , almost to the very end , who stood at the heart of the attempt to prove Mr. Nixon innocent . All that could have ruined Mr. Haig ? in much the same way that other Nixon loyalists were brought down . But in the final week of the Nixon presidency , the lean , suntanned general executed a delicate maneuver that apparently persuaded his new commander-in-chief that the general deserves a promotion . What Mr. Haig did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to recognize finally that the Watergate battle was lost and to gently , deftly steer Mr. Nixon to the decision to resign the presidency . " It was a tightrope he was walking , " says a close Haig associate , " and he was walking it with skill and grace . " Furthermore , says this admirer , " the essential cog in the smooth transition to President Ford , as far as the staff is concerned , has been Al Haig . " Now President Ford seems genuinely to want to take care of Mr. Haig . At the same time , some Ford aides have been urging him to get Gen. Haig out of the White House , contending that he is too great a link to the Watergate scandal . So it is that Mr. Ford and the general are reported by the White House to be " exploring many options . " Published reports suggest that those options include a promotion to NATO commander or , less likely , Army chief of staff . Furious Congressmen But the idea of returning to military service a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some members of Congress . They are searching for ways to block such a move , although the odds are against them . Meanwhile , the promotion talk has revived an old charge against Mr. Haig  --  that he is a " political general " whose career benefited dramatically from his involvement in partisan politics . Yesterday , many here were wondering whether Mr. Haig , who still is White House chief of staff , had a part in President Ford 's highly controversial decision Sunday to pardon Richard Nixon of any Watergate crimes . It is n't known yet whether the general played any role in that decision . But Mr. Haig reportedly has maintained contact with Mr. Nixon during the transition , and he is the only Nixon holdover to have been a frequent consultant of President Ford . Not even Gen. Haig 's harshest critics deny his superior talent and extraordinary capacity for hard work . What they question is the manner in which he rase from colonel to four-star general in only four years . In 1968 , he was a colonel at West Point . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kissinger . In 1972 , he gained four-star rank and the job of Army vice chief of staff  --  vaulting over 240 more senior officers . When he returned to the White House as Mr. Nixon 's right-hand man in 1973 , Gen. Haig held onto his four-star ranking for three months , reluctantly resigning only because of congressional protests that the law expressly prohibits an active military man from holding such a civilian post . These congressional critics argue today that to promote Mr. Haig back across the civilianmilitary boundary would further compromise longstanding safeguards against military involvement in politics . " Haig has already been responsible for setting a dangerous precedent  --  occupying an appointive political office while on active Please Turn fo Page 37 , Column 1 Possibility of Gen. Haig Returning To Military Stirs Much Controversy , Costumed From First Page duty . " argues Rep. John Moss , a California ' Democrat . " We should not allow , nor should this President assist him , in setting a second potentially deadly precedent : that partisan politics pays off enormously for the professional military . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strenuously oppose " any Haig promotion . He calls the general " a fine officer , committed to his country and loyal to his obligations , " and notes that other military men have , on occasion , crossed and recrossed the military-civilian line . Nevertheless , he argues , a Haig appointment would " send a clear signal throughout the military officer corps that politics pays off  --  and in a big way . " The reason , he explains , is that " in no other case of recalling an officer has the officer been intimately involved in . . ( White House ) service during the greatest scandal the nation has ever known . " Success Is Likely It 's questionable whether the critics are strong enough to block an appointment . At the moment , they are n't even sure that appointment to the NATO post would require Senate confirmation , although they 're preparing to argue that it would . An appointment as Army-chief of staff would require Senate confirmation . But in either case , favorable treatment for the general by the pro-military Armed Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face an uphill battle on the Senate floor as well . Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizosa , for example , has dismissed the Proxmire views as " partisan politics . " Gen. Haig , Sen. Goldwater says , did nothing more than take orders from the man who was then his commander-in-chief , Richard Nixon . For Sen. Proxmire to oppose a recall to duty " for a man he describes as a ' fine officer ' merely because he followed orders strikes me as ridiculous , " Mr. Goldwater argues . The general also enjoys solid support among both Fordites and Nixomtes on the White House staff . Inside the White House he is depicted as a man whose only fault , if it can be called a fault , is a self-sacrificing sense.of duty . " He did n't volunteer to come back , " says a key Ford advisor . " Mr. Nixon asked him . Now what 's a man supposed to do in that situation ? What if he had said , speaking as Army vice chief of staff , ' No , Mr. President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape wouldj that have put him in and put the Army in ? " Mr. Haig could n't be reached for comment . But White House staffers who speak up for him vigorously dispute the tag of " political general . " He has had " a magnificent career as a combat officer , " a Ford aide says . " He was highly decorated in Korea . wounded in Korea , had a distinguished career in Vietnam , was wounded again , won the Distinguished Service Cross . Yet you see very few people who talk about Al Haig in terms of a Distinguished Service Cross . " " What man is better qualified " for the NATO post ? asks a close Haig associate . " Of course , he got involved in the Nixon White House , because there was a deterioration of government at the highest level . ... If one wants to call that defending the President , I do n't see how he could have done otherwise . But I think his commitment was , and always has been , to the best interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gen. Haig 's good friend and early booster , Washington attorney Joseph Califano , who was a top man in Lyndon Johnson 's White House . Mr. Califano recruited Mr Haig to the Pentagon in 1963 , when Robert for whom Mr. Califano worked then . was looking for bright young officers . And it was Mr. Califano who worried publicly a decade later that Mr. Haig was making a tragic mistake in returning to the Watergate White House , that the general could be sucked down by Mr. Nixon 's desperate efforts to stay in office . Today Joe Califano is still worried . " I think it would be a tragedy to lose him to public service . " he says " I think he is a fine person . In my own judgment , I ca n't believe that everything he did was n't straight . But people in this town often become symbols of issues , and it 's often very difficult to get around that .
