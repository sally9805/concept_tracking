When most people visit a city , they consult the regulation guidebook , dutifully trudge around to examine the local museum , the famous landmarks , and the historic sites-and then think they know all about the place . Nothing could be farther from the truth , says Richard Saul Wurman , 37 , a Philadelphia architect . Only when Americans really understand the thrust and logic , or illogic , of their cities can they start to improve the urban mess around them . <P> Easier said than done . But Wurman is convinced that the man-made environment of cities holds few mysteries if urban information is explained clearly and concisely . " Given a good map , " he says , " a person can see how parks relate to schools and residential areas . With that information , he can make intelligent decisions about where his city should build new schools or should not build new roads . " Similarly , photographs , drawings , density studies and traffic counts can reveal how cities really work . <P> Trouble is , this data is seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing of Apollo 14 with maps and diagrams clearer than any ever used to describe the location of a new highway on earth , " says Wurman . " We talk in numbers we ca n't comprehend and about sizes we ca n't visualize . " All of which has led the plump , bearded architect to try to fill the need himself . He and Fellow Architect John Gallery have just written a guidebook to his own home town . <P> Entitled Man-Made Philadelphia ( M.I.T. Press ; $3.95 ) , the guide is a boon to tourists and may open Philadelphian eyes as well . Instead of starting with the usual panegyric to Founder William Penn , it begins with three pages of maps of major streets , bus routes and the subway system-the city 's bone structure . The guide duly describes and portrays such Philadelphia splendors as Independence Hall , where the Declaration of Independence was signed , the old residential area of Society Hill , the Beaux Arts vistas of Ben Franklin Parkway . But the authors always remind the reader that there is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that these gaps-not the landmarks alone-give the city its texture , content and life . They thus unabashedly show Philadelphia 's dilapidated docks , bleak slums , traffic jams and ubiquitous graffiti-the real city . <P> The book 's user can find his way around with the help of the clearest , most informative urban maps this side of France 's Michelin guides . He will discover the delicate wrought-iron tracery of Fairmount Park 's old bridges , the city 's best ice cream stand ( Bassett 's in Reading Terminal Market ) , and even a giant automobile crusher on Penrose Avenue . To make sense of the city streets , the book traces Philadelphia 's growth from the neat rectangular grid of streets studded with parks laid out by Penn himself in 1622 , through later annexations of communities like Germantown , to the present sprawling conurbation . It diagrams the changing patterns of ethnic distribution . The old Irish , Russian and German neighborhoods have largely dispersed ; only the Italians in south Philadelphia and the blacks in the decaying north-central area still cluster together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of human decisions , economic pressures and geographical imperatives .
