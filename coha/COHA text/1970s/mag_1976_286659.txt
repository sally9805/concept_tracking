MY FAIR LADY <P> Book and Lyrics by ALAN JAY LERNER <P> Music by FREDERICK LOEWE <P> Yes , Virginia , there is a Broadway Santa Claus , and he has left your iridescent present at Manhattan 's St. James Theater . It is called My Fair Lady , and not to worry or hurry , it will probably run from here to eternity . <P> It is difficult to think of My Fair Lady as a revival , since its words and songs are still in our memories . To see it again is to embrace a much loved relative who has inexcusably spent 20 years abroad . Nothing has diminished ; this musical is one of the quintessential glo ries of the American theater . <P> Recently , in print , Producer Herman Levin asked everyone to perform a willed act of amnesia and forget that Rex Harrison ever played Professor Higgins and Julie Andrews played Eliza Doolittle . That is impossible . <P> Phonetic Retard . While still as elegant as it was before , My Fair Lady has changed in texture because of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glacial unconcern for people as people . Ian Richardson , on the other hand , is too humane to treat Eliza as a phonetic retard . For him , she is an emotional event . Despite Shaw 's impassioned lip service to English , he often treated it either as a handgun or a toy . Richardson treats it as the lineal descendant of Shakespeare . The text can not always bear the weight of that sort of gravity and eloquence . As Eliza , Christine Andreas has the richness of voice that one associates with opera-and , alas , some of the same crimped acting range . She is a more warm-blooded woman than Julie Andrews , but considerably less of a flower girl or a lady . Perhaps it is difficult for an American actress to comprehend either . But like a windjammer , Shaw 's imagination sails past all obstacles . <P> Repeating his original role as Pickering , Higgins ' bachelor buddy , Robert Coote is delightful , and George Rose is " loverly " as Eliza 's earthily vulgar father . The Lerner-Loewe score is incomparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first bar to applaud .
