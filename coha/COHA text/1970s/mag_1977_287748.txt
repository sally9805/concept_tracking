He had been baseball 's golden boy , the handsome hero with the strong right arm who almost singlehanded wrought the Miracle of 1969-the young New York Mets ' rise from happy-shabby obscurity to a World Series championship . In eleven seasons with the team , Tom Seaver had won the Cy Young Award three times . Only two weeks ago , in a game against the Cincinnati Reds , he chalked up the 42th shutout of his career , and in the process struck out ten Reds batters . This brought his lifetime strikeout total to 2,400 and pulled him ahead of Sandy Koufax ( 2,396 strikeouts ) on the list of alltime strikeout leaders . The game was held up for three minutes as the Mets ' faithful in New York 's Shea Stadium stood to cheer . <P> After months of acrimonious bickering between Seaver and his team 's front office , Mets fans seemed to sense that the game would be his farewell to New York . Sure enough , just hours before the trading deadline last week , the star , known among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Cincinnati Reds for second-year Pitcher Pat Zachry , Utility Infielder Doug Flynn and two minor leaguers . <P> The trade , one of the most dramatic in baseball history , climaxed a 16-month dispute between a proud-if sometimes preachy-player and a stubborn management . Early in 1976 , when Seaver balked at signing a new contract , Mets Board Chairman M. Donald Grant huffed that the pitcher was an " ingrate " who cared more about his wallet than his team . Seaver lashed back : " My loyalty is to my family . " The war was on . <P> Both men took to airing their views to sympathetic reporters , who eagerly carried on the dispute in the New York tabloids . Eventually , Seaver signed a three-year contract fixing his salary at $225,000 per year , with elaborate performance clauses , e.g. , bonus clauses which could increase his pay to $260,000 annually . But the damage had been done : Grant had threatened a trade , thus making a once unthinkable idea suddenly thinkable . <P> Irate Fans . Neither the Mets nor Seaver had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third in the National League 's Eastern Division . Attendance slipped , and with interest picking up in the Yankees , New Yorkers began to regard the Mets less as lovable losers than as just losers , period . Seaver pitched well , but was hobbled by the Mets ' impotent offense : the .246 team batting average was the lowest in the major leagues . When training opened this year , Seaver openly criticized Grant 's refusal to enter the free-agent draft in search of needed hitting talent . Grant was also locked in a contract dispute with Slugger Dave Kingman , the team 's single long-ball threat , and the effect of another round of debilitating negotiations showed up in Kingman 's performance . Still unsigned , he was traded to the San Diego Padres within hours after Seaver was sent to the Reds . <P> In Seaver 's view , Grant 's tightfisted , unaggressive management consigned the club to a mediocre future . He asked that his contract be renegotiated . Grant , a Wall Street stockbroker , issued a statement outlining club policy against renegotiation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental cornerstone of our country and baseball as well . " Seaver asked to be traded . <P>
