The standout this year : a pea with an edible pod <P> A classic New Yorker cartoon pictured Moppet staring mutinously at Mom over a plate of murky compost . " It 's broccoli , dear , " says Mom . Says Moppet : ' ' I say it 's spinach , and I say the hell with it . " There is good news for M. &; M. The 1979 garden catalogues piling into mailboxes this spring offer a number of vegetables that look like spinach , taste better than spinach , but are not Spinacia oleracea . Some of them have been imported from the Orient , notably shungiku ( Chrysanthemum coronarium ) and tampala hinn choy ( Amaranthus tricolor ) . <P> But the hell with spinach . For the venturesome home gardener , there is a new sweet pepper , Dutch Treat , whose pungent fruits progress from yellow to orange to red and are edible at all stages ; it comes , naturally , from Holland . There is also an improved version of the so-called yard-long bean , a.k.a . Orient Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China come bitter melon , gow choy , a garlicky chive , bok choy cabbage , and an aromatic celery , heung kuhn - all valuable for good wokmanship . A Japanese melon called Honey Drip is described by its originators as " intolerably delicious . " Vegetable growers , generally a conservative lot , have been slow to pick up on an unusual variety called vegetable spaghetti : it is a member of the squash family that , when opened up , yields oodles of non-noodles that can be prepared exactly like pasta . <P> There are several novelty strains of sweet corn , notably " candy stick , " which is only one inch thick but a foot long and is ideal for freezing ; other innovations include the first bush-type butternut squash and a tomato , Long-Keeper , that stays fresh up to four months after picking . The redoubtable Burpee catalogue alone offers such enticements as the spacemaster cucumber , a pumpkin whose seeds can be eaten raw , and Sugar Bush watermelon , which represent years of genetic selection not only for flavor but - more important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Not in decades , however , has a single new vegetable stirred such horti-culinary hyperbole as a rogue one-chance-in-a-million mutant developed over years by the Gallatin Valley Seed Co. of Twin Falls , Idaho . It is called the Sugar Snap pea . Somewhat like a snow pea , but with plump , juicy kernels and melt-in-the-mouth pods , it also has some of the characteristics of a snap green bean and should be eaten pod and all . The Burpee catalogue , which gives it cover-sweetie treatment , calls it " truly fantastic . " The authoritative magazine of the venerable Massachusetts Horticultural Society joins the seed industry in hailing it as " the best new vegetable in over 100 years of plant breeding .
