THE MACKINTOSH MAN is a triumph of the packager 's craft . It brings together a trio of international stars ( Paul Newman , Dominique Sanda and James Mason ) , an array of first-class English supporting players ( Harry Andrews , Ian Bannen , Nigel Patrick ) , and a renowned director ( John Huston ) whose work is not what it once was-or seemed to be - but who remains a solidly professional moviemaker . However , a close inspection of the script could have saved everyone a lot of trouble . It seems to have been prematurely disinterred from a time capsule devoted to the cultural artifacts of the 1960s , when spies were coming in out of the cold war 's shadows to warm themselves in the world 's moviehouses . Newman is a double agent who is sent to prison in England in order to be sprung by a gang specializing in elaborate and unlikely jail breaks ; then , using his fugitive status as a cover , he is to track down a major violator of the Official Secrets Act . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beatings , doublecrosses and whatnot . There are even two novelties : a woman kicked in the groin and a bit of blather about letting the Commie spies go , since everyone seems to be letting bygones be bygones these days . Within the limits of the genre , this stuff is handled well enough . It just seems terribly redundant , even to the people involved in it . <P> MAURIE is an unprecedented film - the first full-scale weeper for men . It is the slightly fictionalized history of the relationship between Maurice Stokes , a black basketball player who was named rookie of the year after his first season with the Cincinnati Royals , then was mysteriously paralyzed , and Jack Twyman , a white man and one of the team 's stars , who oversaw and financed a ten-year attempt to rehabilitate Stokes . In the end Stokes died , but not before recovering his ability to speak and to work , albeit painfully , with his hands . <P> As for Twyman , what began as a casual case of good Samaritanism and team spirit turned into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director Daniel Mann do not explore the complexities or growth of either character . They play their story strictly and obviously for tears and inspiration . <P> Bernie Casey in the title role and Bo Svenson as Twyman work with affecting simplicity and nice touches of humor , much of the time undercutting the film makers ' implacable drive for sentimentality . Their combined efforts remind us that the relationship between these men was more interesting than a Love Story for jocks . <P> BADGE 373 , according to the credits , is " inspired by the exploits of Eddie Egan , " the former New York cop whose fictionalized doings were also the basis for The French Connection . But inspired is not a word to be employed anywhere near this flat-footed flatfoot saga . <P> Indeed , Egan could probably sue the producers for defamation of character .
