Strange , oddball , unpredictable things have a way of happening on the night they give out the small modernistic golden figurines of a man with his hands clasped . Having him means being named the best this or the best that in the world of film making while the rest of the world watches . There was the year when Ronald Reagan , then president of the Screen Actors Guild , introduced a reel of excerpts from earlier Oscar-winning features . " This film embodies the glories of our past and the inspiration of our future , " Reagan intoned . The theater darkened . The hush deepened . And the film came on upside down . There was the night when a nude male " streaked " across the stage behind David Niven , who happened to be at the podium . This prompted Niven to remark , " It 's too bad that probably the only laugh that man will get in his lifetime is stripping off his shorts and revealing his shortcomings . " When Oscar happenings happen , 70 million television sets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been time to fly cans of TV film to 50 other countries , 200 million more viewers look and listen to the same goings on . It requires no brains to realize that the ringmaster for what shapes up every year as a 20-ring circus must be unflappable . He must be a man so unfazed by the unforeseeable that he takes the weirdest manifestations of human behavior in his stride . When the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences faced the problem of finding such a man this year , their quest ended with Mister Unflappable himself , a man to whom the unpredictable happens every time he wanders out from behind the glistening ripple of stage curtains to emcee his own show . This man is Johnny Carson . His program is the " Tonight " show . I knew all that when my phone rang one morning in my home in Chester County , Pennsylvania . A voicein Indianapolis asked , " Can you be in California at 10:00 on the morning of February 5 to talk with Johnny Carson ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't wonder why I 'd been given the Carson assignment any more than I 'd wondered why I was asked to call on Jimmy Stewart , Jim Garner , and Tony Randall last year  --  or All McGraw when she did Love Story or Robert Young when he was Marcus Welby . The fact that Carson was my next assignment did n't puzzle me . Almost every night I lie in my bed with a remote control in my hand and tune in on the " Tonight " show . After that I lie there laughing my fool head off at the monologue with which Johnny opens his show . I figured if I do that , millions of others must do it , too ; that makes him a hot prospect for an interview . The fact that Johnny had been this year 's Oscar awards emcee made him even hotter . Before I 'd flown to California , I 'd put in a few hours in the Philadelphia Bulletin 's library studying clippings mentioning Johnny 's name . I was lucky to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that paper 's Sunday magazine . I do n't do it any more , but the Bulletin 's librarian is very kind to me . The mental picture those clippings gave me of Johnny was wholly unlike the Carson I 'd watched on my TV set at the foot of my bed . One set of clippings was a story about Johnny written by a girl from Look . She had n't liked him . Then there was a TV Guide cover story about him . It made him seem prickly . The Look writer put it this way : " Johnny is a master of the put-down. . . of withering with a glance . .. of the acid tongue retort . . . . He rarely consents to see the press . Off camera he is defensive , preoccupied , withdrawn , inept , uncomfortable with people . . . . Each of his short sentences turns on and off like an ice-cold water tap . " He must have changed 200 percent since those stories were written . Or maybe I 'm just old lovable Pete Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I doubt that . I doubt it very much . I 've written stories for the Post about Shelley Winters , Debbie Reynolds , Rock Hudson , and Mike Wallace that none of them liked . Shelley called me long distance to tell me what a four-letter word she thought I was . She was so angry she sputtered and I could n't understand what she said . Rock did n't tell me what a heel I was for 20 years ; then he sent his reaction through an agent . The man described in the clippings I pored over in the Bulletin library was totally unlike the Johnny Carson I met in California and talked with in his home . When my taxi pulled up in front of his gate , he greeted me himself . He wore neat , trim tennis shorts . His face , which looks Irish to me , was split with the infectious grin I knew so well because of the hours I 'd spent with it only six feet away from me . On our way to his sitting room lounge I found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviewers ' names had been suggested to him ; he 'd okayed me . " One of the first jokes I ever wrote had your name in it , " he told me . " I was doing local television in the Midwest . I 'd written a script for myself about one of those old film fan magazines . ' Take this one , ' I said and held up one that looked Hollywoodish . ' Its lead article is " How Far Should Petting Go ? " by Lassie as told to Pete Martin . Do n't miss it . ' That was about 25 years ago . " I told him I had come into his life a long time ago , too . I said I 'd bet he could n't remember when and how . " Where did we meet ? " he asked , puzzled . I said , " You had a show in New York many years ago on which you gave a $50 prize to people who answered questions like , ' What was Washington 's first name ? ' I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks . " " Yes , I did a show like that called ' Who Do You Trust ? ' on ABC , " Johnny said . " It was a comedy interview show done originally by Edgar Bergen called ' Do You Trust Your Wife ? ' When Edgar gave it up , it went to New York . I did it for five years . The idea was to get people to play silly games . That had to be sometime between 1956 and 1962 , just before I took over the ' Tonight ' show after Jack Paar left it . " " Do you know why Jack wept so easily ? " I asked him with curiosity . " I did n't know Jack all that well , " Johnny said , " but he was a very emotional man . He took things personally . And he was super sensitive . He wore his heart on his sleeve , and if something bothered him , tears came . For Jack , weeping was a catharsis . " " Aside from featuring my story about Johnny Carson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photograph of you on its cover . It 's probably already at the photoengravers . " " They should have had the painting Norman Rockwell did of me a few years ago , " he said . " The only problem is it 's several years old . I got it on the eighth or ninth anniversary of the ' Tonight ' show . I 'm not sure people would recognize me in it now . " ( I made a mental note to call Indianapolis and tell the Post 's editors about that Rockwell as soon as I got back to my hotel . ) " One of the things I want to ask you is this , " I told him . " How would you react to some of the things that have happened on the Oscar show ? For example , take Vanessa Redgrave 's political speech last year when some people in the audience booed her . What would you have done if you 'd been the emcee ? " " That 's hard to say , " he told me . " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to sit at home and know . If you 're a host or a master of ceremonies , one of your jobs is to read your audience , to feel what kind of mood they are in and what their reactions are at the time . There were pros and cons about what she said . Some people felt she should n't have done it . I do n't think anyone should use a show that 's an industry show , whether it 's the Oscar show or the Emmy show or the Tony show , as a platform for a political statement . That 's not the place for it . Anyhow , I think I would have tried to handle it in a humorous vein . I might have said , ' I know just how you feel , Vanessa . I 'm for the Eskimos ' right to eat fish , too . ' But you really have to be there when a thing like that happens to have a gut instinct as to what 's right to say at the time . " " Suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage behind David Niven ? " I asked him . " I was watching that at home , " Johnny said , " and the first thing I said to my wife was , ' Obviously he 's not up for the best supporting actor award . He could n't hold anything up . ' That 's what I would have said if I 'd been there in Niven 's place . But David handled it beautifully . He really did . " " One of the things I am curious about is why they picked you to emcee the Oscar show , " I told him . " I 've done a lot of this kind of thing , " he said ; " I did the Emmy awards for three years . Or they might have picked me because of my experiences with the Tonight ' show . Hosting that show , you find yourself in a lot of situations . It trains your mind to work fast . If you do n't have a gift for ad-libbing , you 'd better develop one . " The Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on and on until it is finished . That 's one of the problems that a host finds it difficult to solve . It 's so easy for the Oscar show to become overly long . More than two and a half hours is very long indeed . " I said , " Greer Garson made one of the longest speeches ever made on an Oscar show . How would you handle a situation like that ? " " You ca n't , " he said . " They tell those who win to take only 30 seconds to say their thank-you 's . But if somebody wins an award like an Oscar , very likely it 's the only time in his life a thing that important will happen to him . So he gets emotional and he starts thanking everybody from the plumber to mom and dad . " " Do you remember the night when Marlon Brando refused to show up to accept his award ? Instead , he sent an Indian girl dressed in a leather dress and a beaded headband as a stand-in for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny said . " Sasheen Little Feather , I think . At least , that 's what my memory tells me it was . I believe that 's right . " " What would your reaction have been to that ? " " Once more , I do n't know from here , " he said . " I 'd have had to be there and get the feel of the situation . In a spot like that you work from the feeling you and the audience have at that moment . Things you might say if you watched it at home you might not say if you were there . " " Let 's go back to the Emmy shows you 've emceed , " I suggested . " You must remember a couple of spontaneous ad-libs you delivered on those occasions . " " I 'll have to think back , " he said . " A line I did once on one of the Emmy shows that drew comments was about an appearance of the Johnny Mann singers . They came out and did a medley of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohan-type things . They then saluted , and finished with a very large American flag unrolled on the stage . It seemed to me very chauvinistic and out of context in an Em-my show . So I told the audience I hoped they 'd find war bonds on sale in the lobby , and if they did , please to buy bundles of them . I do n't think Johnny Mann liked that , but the audience loved it . It needed a deadpan joshing . " Changing the subject , I told him , " This has nothing to do with Oscar night , but when you rejoined your Tonight ' show last week after being away from it two or three times , I thought you were great . You had fresh material about Billy Carter and Lee Marvin . It seems to me you 're better after a rest than when you work straight through night after night . " " Any performer 's ener- gy level is better after a rest , " he told me . " My writers are fresher , too . They 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show five days a week , it was tough to keep my energy level from drop- ping around Thursday or Friday . I got tired mental- ly , and when you tire mentally , you might re- peat yourself if you 're not alert and do n't watch it . The trick in our show is to keep from being boring . If I did n't have time off to do mental and physical re- bounding , I 'd have quit the show five years ago . " " Somehow , " I said , " I do n't think of your show as a talk show in the same sense that Dinah 's and Merv 's and Mike 's are talk shows . How do you de- scribe your show ? " " It 's comedy orient- ed , " he told me . " It 's en-tertainment . To me , a talk show is more like Bill Buckley 's or Dick Cavett 's  --  a straight kind of inter-view thing . We go more for humor . Not that we do n't occasionally touch on serious subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most comfortable doing . I feel at ease just entertaining . I go out there to make people laugh . Although we interview people , I feel awkward with the label ' Talk Show . ' We do comedy sketches and blackouts , and I do a monologue every night . So ours is more than just sitting there having a one-on-one interview . " " I think your monologue is the best part of the show , " I told him . " Your line  --  The President is having a bad year ; he has an unbalanced budget and an unbalanced brother at the same time ' ? was a killCT. 7 7 " If I did n't have the monologue to look forward to , I do n't know what I 'd do , " he said . " It 's about the only show on television right now that does a topical monologue every day . We can do it because our show is n't delayed . We tape our show the same day it 's seen so we can work out of the morning newspaper stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Lee Marvin trial or Billy Carter 's latest peccadillo . Once in a while , I might say something the audience might not be familiar with , but most people follow the news on television even if they do n't read the papers . They know what 's going on . " " How much of your monologue do you write yourself ? " I asked . " For the most part , my monologue is written by my writers . I edit it . I may add to it . I may even ad-lib during the monologue . But it 's an everyday thing and no one person can sit down and write a good monologue every single day . I 've got to have several good writers . So I ca n't take credit for the clever lines in my monologue . Of course , lots of times when I step out there , if something I say does n't play , I go off in a different direction on my own . " " What quality do you look for in your writers ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " is , I think , the most difficult form of writing . To write amusingly you need a mind that works like Stephen Lea-cock 's or P. G. Wodehouse 's or Robert Benchley 's . The one who does it best currently is Perelman and there 's only one like him . They 're rare . My writers not only have to be knowledgeable about what 's going on , they have to have more than average intelligence . They have to know what 's happening politically and socially in the country so they can write what I call observational comments on the human condition without coming on too heavy with it . Then , too , they have to be well read and be able to give the right visual concepts . I do n't think we ever get vicious . We are pretty satiric sometimes , and once in a while we will do a line that 's kind of a zinger . To me , a zinger is just as sharp as , but has less malice than , a stinger . I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a curve on it  --  as long as you do n't get cruel . I admire writers who can sit down at the typewriter every morning and knock out even 10 or 12 or 15 good lines . It 's a tough art . Mine also know my style . They know how I 'll deliver a certain line of theirs . " " What kind of style ? " I asked . " I ca n't tell you , " he said . " I really ca n't . I guess I do it by instinct and by editing . I suppose there is a certain irreverence in my humor . But when somebody asks ' How do you work ? ' or ' How do you describe yourself ? ' , I find it impossible to do a self-analysis on it . Most comedians do what they do without trying to think it out . Analysis gets in the way . " " I interviewed Jack Benny once , " I told him , " or at least I tried to . I found out that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper  --  and those two things were what made him a comic genius . " " Of course you could n't do that , " Johnny agreed . " Nobody could . I knew Jack very well . He was one of my best friends . Jack was a comedy actor . Not that he was n't amusing . He could be very amusing , but basically that 's what he was , a comedy actor . Over the years , he created a character known as Jack . He built up the image of a mythical tightwad trying to be perennially young . That happened over a period of many years through his work in radio and motion pictures . Jack was portraying that character all the time . You could write a situation for Jack because you knew how the character he 'd created would react to what was going on around him . Also , Jack was a wonderful editor , the best comedy editor I 've ever known . He knew exactly what was right for him . Jack gave everybody else the laughs . Very often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was smart enough to realize that whether it was Phil Harris or his wife Mary or Rochester who was putting him down , it was always ' The Jack Benny Show ' no matter who got the laughs . " Of course , he was n't that kind of person in real life . He was very generous and warm . With the concept of comedy he invented , he could walk out in front of an audience , look at them , say one word ( Well ... ' ) , and get a laugh . Nobody else could . You 're right , Pete . There is no way to put that on paper . Grouch() was more of a hostile , satiric type with a certain rhythm in his speech that was funny . " " When the Oscar award people offered you the job , did you give it some thought before you said yes ? " I asked . " I did a little , " he said . " My concern was that , since it 's a motion picture affair rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not involved in pictures would be the master of ceremonies for their show . But they seemed to feel that basically Oscar night is a television show , so they wanted somebody who 's used to doing television to handle it . Happily , there did n't seem to be any resentment over choosing me from the people in the business . ( Of course , I had to realize that I could n't be as irreverent about the Oscars as I have been with the Emmy awards ; having been in TV for so long makes a difference . ) " " I did n't like it when Oscar night had four or five different emcees , " I said . " It was less jerky when a man like Bob Hope kept things flowing . " " They tried multiple emcees with the Emmy awards a number of times , " he told me , " but I 've always felt that one person in charge could handle it easier and keep it moving better than having three or four emcees . " " I know people who say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " I asked him . " I do n't really know , " Johnny told me . " Words like that have a double entendre ; they mean different things to different people . What 's blue and what 's obscene and what 's raunchy are a puzzle to me . I do n't like the word blue . ' To me it connotes a cheap , dirty joke . Not that , on our ' Tonight ' show , we do n't occasionally lapse over into areas that make people uncomfortable ; I 'm sure we do . But , if we do , we do n't try to . I remember a few years ago in a TV drama they would n't let the actors say sexual intercourse . ' It was a play about a husband and wife and he was having trouble with impotency and I think she said to somebody , ' Somehow we are n't able to have sexual intercourse . ' The network found that abhorrent . I could n't understand why they could say ' sexual relations ' and could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' having sex ' is all right , " I suggested . " It might be , " Johnny said . " It is only ' sexual intercourse ' that seems to bother them . Somebody said in a recent issue of a magazine that Norman Lear and Lee Rich and some producers were talking about the problems of writing for television and they mentioned something that was forbidden on the Gunsmoke ' series for 20 years . You could show cowboys going up to the second floor of the saloon to kill somebody , but you could n't show them going upthose stairs with a girl and going into a room . It was forbidden if they might be going up there to make a little love , but if they were going upstairs to blow somebody 's head off it was fine and dandy . So everybody 's definition of what 's obscene or makes him uncomfortable is different . When I 'm on the air , I try to edit myself and not say things I think people will find offensive . But I 've discovered that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that offends somebody . " I made jokes about our show , like I 'd say we give a great night light if you do n't turn off your set when you have to go to the bathroom or ' Our show may be more effective than the pill when it comes to population control . ' Somebody in the audience took offense at both those . I did n't think either one was blue or obscene but there were people who objected . I realize that television goes into the home for free . It 's unlike motion pictures that people have to pay to go to see . If you watch it regularly , there are more violence and more sexual carryings on in daytime soap operas than there are in all nighttime television shows put together . In soaps , they talk about infidelity . They get into abortions . They get into homosexuality . They get into people sleeping with people and having affairs . But that does n't seem to bother anybody . " Still , television has grown up a little over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant ' even in motion pictures . Now you 'll hear hell ' and ' damn ' on television . I caught George Scott in Patton on my TV set a few nights ago and he said ' bastard ' . I think there might have been a ' son-of-a-bitch ' in there , too . But they drew the line at a four-letter word meaning human feces ' . They still do . I think that 's right . I 'm certainly not an advocate of the use of absolute freedom of speech in the field of entertainment . Nobody is for making a motion picture with people yelling foul words every other sentence . I 've certainly never held any such view . " Along with freedom comes a certain responsibility . You 've got to self-edit yourself as newspapers do . Motion pictures should have license to do what they want to do because no one has to go to see them . You have to pay money to see one , and if you know that a movie is X-rated or R-rated , you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Television is different . It , Continued on page 96 Johnny Carson continued from page 79 like newspapers , comes into the home . So they both have to have standards about what 's permissible and what 's not . " " What you tell me about soap operas in the afternoon interests me , " I said . " I 'd have thought that your being on late at night when children are in bed would give you more freedom . " " Being on from 11:30 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. does give us a little more freedom , " he agreed . " The truth is I have very few problems with the network about what we can do . I 've been in television so long I police myself instinctively . What 's more , I think we do a pretty good job at it . a year to do our show . Then we started making four trips west of three weeks apiece . The next thing we knew , we were doing three months a year in California , because the facilities were here to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's become a cliche , but the entertainment coming out of New York , especially in television , is not what it was 20 years ago  --  not the same quality . There were lots of shows emanating from New York then . Mighty few now . To simplify the reasons , we found it much easier to function out here as far as our show is concerned . If I say , ' We want to do a sketch tomorrow and I need a certain thing built for it , ' they can go right across the hall and build it . We did n't have those facilities in New just talking . That 's the way our characters usually start . Then I try to figure out how to play them . " The trouble with our skits is our time is so limited . We never have the rehearsal time you get on a weekly show . And when I say ' rehearsal ' that 's a loose word . There 's so little time for run-throughs . We stick a skit together ; then we 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all the rehearsal time we have . . . ? " " Have you ever been in a movie ? " I asked . " With the schedule I 'm on with the Tonight ' show , the longest period I 've ever had off was three or four weeks . People send me lots of movie scripts but you ca n't make a movie in three or four weeks . Movies would have in- I said , " To me you look better when you stand up there doing your monologue than you do when you sit down behind your desk . " " People have kidded me about the way I stand , " he said . " Maybe I picked it up from my parents who told me ' Stand up straight ' when I was a kid . I do n't know . It 's just the way I feel comfortable when I stand . I have more freedom when I 'm not behind my desk . I can use body language a little . " S peaking of body language reminded me of something . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of each of your monologues all about ? " I asked . He grinned ; then he said , " I do n't know how that started . I guess I did it years ago at the end of a monologue when I had just taken up golf . Then it got to be a habit . I do n't play golf any more , but one night when I finished up on TV , I made a little swinging gesture and somehow it became an identifiable tag meaning my monologue was over . " He changed the subject himself this time . " I 've enjoyed your stuff for many , many years , " he told me . " I used to have a Saturday Evening Post route when I was a kid .

Take the old lady we call Aunt Blabby . ' I was doing her in Omaha in 1949 . She played a variety of roles . She 'd arrange flowers . She gave lectures on how to set a table . When I got older myself , I played her a little older . My Carnac character I did years ago in a daytime show for KNXT in Los Angeles . We called it our ' Backward Quiz .

Making movies is a very rough thing to do . You do n't know after you have made a movie if it 's any good . What I get in television that you do n't get in movies is immediate feedback . I go on at night and get the audience 's reaction right away . I know whether I am good or had in a second or two . When you make a movie , your audience is nobody except the camera crew .

" He must be a good guy and he 's very loyal to you . But it seems to me that sometimes his laugh is almost too loud . " " He does n't mean it to be , " Johnny told me .

" Reaching over , I flicked off my recorder . " I 've plenty of material , " I said . " My trouble will be what to throw out .

" The catch is that each " It 's too bad about Carson " forecast had been followed by figures telling how many million more sets are tuned in on him each year and how much more generous his network was in paying him for his yearly stint . With each gloomy look-see at Johnny 's future , those figures grew larger . The way I see it , Johnny and his show can go right on being on tap for your entertainment and mine as long as he wants to stay in there swinging .
