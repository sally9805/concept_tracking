Racial jokes are also the staple of television 's other top comedy show , All in the Family-but with a difference . Where Flip Wilson kids conventional prejudices by turning them inside out , Family 's archbigot Archie Bunker ( Carroll O'Connor ) is a living compendium of those prejudices . To see how Archie might react to Flip , TIME asked Family Producer-Writer Norman Lear to imagine a scene in the Bunker living room after the family has watched Flip 's show . Lear 's script : <P> Gloria : Daddy , Flip Wilson really flips you , does n't he ? <P> Archie : Flip Wilson ? I can take him or leave him . <P> Mike : Come on , Arch , I ca n't remember when I saw you laugh so hard . <P> Edith : That 's right , Archie . Especially when he got in them lady 's clothes . . . <P> Archie : Edith , stifle ! <P> Edith : And played Ernestine . . . <P> Archie : I said , stifle ! I do n't know what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we enjoyed it ... <P> Mike : Enjoyed it , hell ! I saw you split a gut ! The guy is just plain funny-why ca n't you admit it ? <P> Archie : So . He 's funny . I 'm the foist to admit it . But I did n't split no gut . I do that maybe for Bob Hope . He 's really funny ! <P> Gloria : What 's Bob Hope got to do with this ? <P> Archie : Nothin ' . He 's just the daddy of ' em all , that 's all ! <P> Edith : ( amazed ) Bob Hope is Flip Wilson 's father ? <P> Archie : Edith ! ! <P> Mike : Archie , I never heard you laugh at Bob Hope the way you just laughed at Flip Wilson . <P> Archie : Go on ! The man entertained our boys through three wars-do n't that mean nothin ' to you ? <P> Mike : Okay . So he entertained the troops . But that does n't make him funnier . <P> Archie : The hell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he come up the hard way , too ! ! <P> Mike : What the hell does that mean , Bob Hope came up the hard way ? <P> Archie : Well , he did n't have whatchya call yer natural endowerments . His people was n't all singers and dancers an ' like that ! <P> Mike : You mean he was n't black ? <P> Archie : Right . <P> Mike : So Bob Hope came up the hard way-and Flip Wilson had it ready , made and waiting ! Is that it ? <P> Archie : You 're takin ' what I said out of contest , like ya always do , Mr. Big Liberal . All I meant was , bein ' colored , Flip had a natural advantage of entertainin ' being in his blood . <P> Edith : I thought it 's tougher bein ' born black . <P> Archie : Edith , you got ta stop readin ' what them two bleeding hearts bring home ! I 'm tellin ' ya-you wan na get into sports or entertainment , it 's easier bein ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell do we get from one hour of your solid laughter at Flip Wilson to another of your broadside attacks against all blacks ? <P> Archie : There you go-just about ready to accuse me of prejudice again , ai n't ya ? <P> Mike : ( hopelessly ) Yeah , Arch , " just about ready . " <P> Archie : An ' all because I paid yer favorite minority a few compliments . <P> Mike : But you said black Flip Wilson was n't as funny as white Bob Hope .
