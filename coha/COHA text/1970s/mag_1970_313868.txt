FROM THE CRASH TO THE BLITZ : 1929-1939 by Cabell Phillips . 596 pages . Macmillan . $12.50 . <P> What explains the popularity of the only-yesterday school of history ? Is it the reassuringly manageable look ? Chaos neatly packaged with all the shapeliness of the Farmer 's Almanac . Is it the pleasant mood of nostalgia ? One 's youth staged under soft lights to the music of Guy Lombardo . Is it the chewy , toothsome presence of facts ? Dates , names and practically nothing else . <P> Whatever the reason , just feed readers those scenario-setting lines like " Saturday , March 4 , 1933 , was a raw , blustery day in Washington ... " and watch them freak out , history-trippers all . <P> New York Timesman Cabell Phillips , author of The Truman Presidency and a Washington reporter for 25 years , says that the " framework " of what he calls his " journalistic reprise " is " necessarily political . " But the charm of the only-yesterday memoir is its look of pure miscellany . For all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no exception . <P> At the cocktail party of total recall , Lou Gehrig rubs elbows with Harry Hopkins , and Hitler bumps nastily into John Dillinger . Jean Harlow , meet Eleanor Roosevelt . Jim Farley , do you know Ina Ray Hutton ? Father Coughlin , as I live and breathe ! <P> Juxtaposition makes trivia . Election results get scrambled with World Series scores and the falling stock quotations on " Black Thursday , " 1929 . Depression breadlines seem to queue up next to Earl Carroll chorus lines . <P> And what can Phillips possibly say about the Depression ? First , the throat-clearing generalization : " Some authorities describe it as the ultimate collapse of the industrial revolution , with the machine devouring man . " Then on to the insatiate facts : one family in five had $3,000 to spend in 1932 , the average weekly wage of factory workers was $16.21 , the cost of a Chevy was $445 , etc . The New Deal becomes a kind of family album of brain-truster portraits , with a few hasty tributes from Old Liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most profound and the most enduring " of F.D.R. 's reforms . <P> Only-yesterday histories have special charm for the connoisseur who wants to collect early POLICE BRUTALITY pictures ( see page 263 ) . Or the crank who loves typographical errors-Charles Lindberg ( page 23 ) , P. G. Woodhouse ( page 472 ) , Charles Evens Hughes ( page 503 ) . The only-yesterday 's narrator is a White Rabbit . Always he must hurry on . With more than 850 photographs and drawings , Phillips ' documentary spews images at double-quick newsreel speed while spieling commentary at the tempo of a tobacco auctioneer . <P> From the Crash to the Blitz is the first volume in the New York Times series , Chronicle of American Life . The 1940s , 1950s and 1960s are also scheduled to be turned into only-yesterday history . Stand by , America , for all the nostalgia that 's fit to print .
