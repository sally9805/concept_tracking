The lefthander was still feeling his way through the first set , playing well but not brilliantly with the deft , almost effortless touch that is the trademark of his game , when suddenly it happened , and in an instant , there he was again-Peck 's bad boy of tennis . After blowing a key shot , John McEnroe hurled his racquet . The offending piece of equipment landed at the feet of McEnroe 's surprised opponent , Hie Nastase , the acknowledged prince of the tennis temper tantrum . <P> Whether his shots were dropping for winners or thudding into the net , McEnroe continued to pout his way through the match , projecting the air of a sullen young man seething with resentment at a world arrayed against him . He once demanded of Umpire Mike Blanchard , 71 : " Did you see that one ? Can you see that far , Mike ? " Smirking broadly , Nastase cleverly exploited the situation . At one point he waited for the crowd to stop booing McEnroe , then declared : " He 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nastase in the contest of theatrics , but unfortunately for the dashing vulgarian , they were playing tennis with a ball last week in the sultry heat of Montego Bay , Jamaica . And McEnroe , once he settled down , was magnificent , defeating Nastase in three sets , his first tournament victory over the old campaigner . For his two hours of work at the World Championship Tennis Challenge Cup , McEnroe earned $10,000 , raising his earnings to over $200,000 since he dropped out of Stanford University just six months ago , gave up washing his own socks and turned pro with a vengeance . <P> The money , and the hours , would be hard to beat , but McEnroe had other good reasons to be pleased . On the previous weekend , his temper well under control , he had led the U.S. team to victory over the British in the Davis Cup matches in Rancho Mirage , Calif , winning two singles without losing a set and overwhelming Buster Mottram in the key contest . No one in the 68 years of competition for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finals . The win was the first in six years for the American team , which has been shunned by top pros , such as Jimmy Connors , who prefer to play elsewhere . ( The Cup pays only $2,000 , plus expenses . ) But McEnroe thoroughly enjoyed the role of patriot athlete . " When you see your flag and they play your national anthem , it 's a little different , " he says . And McEnroe also liked the sensation of contributing to a team victory : " That 's really a nice feeling . There 's not really that much of that kind of thing in tennis any more . " <P> There sure is n't . The game is dominated by strong-willed individualists , led by the fiery Connors , 26 , and the icy Bjorn Borg , 22 , his great Swedish rival , who compete in a series of tournaments round the world for big money that is getting bigger all the time . Borg has earned $661,000 , Connors $519,000 and Vitas Gerulaitis $425,000 to date this year .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
