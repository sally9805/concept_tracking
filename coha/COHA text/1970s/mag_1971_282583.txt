Part of the price of doing business with the Arab world is that many oil companies for more than two decades have quietly complied with a worldwide boycott of Israeli products . But boycotts , like censorship , all too often take on absurd dimensions . <P> Witness the case of Mobil Oil Co . A London-based subsidiary , Mobil Marine Services , sent a letter to ships ' chandlers , ordering them not to supply Mobil tankers with " any products of Israeli origin , or seeming to have Israeli or Jewish connections . " Mobil 's caution stems from the fact that the boycott has been intensified of late by the fanatically anti-Israel government of Libya . Whenever a tanker enters a Libyan port , it is searched . If there is anything aboard that has been made or grown in Israel , the owner of the ship is fined or the vessel is seized . The Libyan government recently moved to new extremes , and so did Mobil . To the taboo list , the Libyan government added-and the company complied with-Jaffa orange juice canned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli connections at all : Brazilian beer and ginger ale , Trinidadian orange juice and Swedish matches . Reason : the labels of all four have six-pointed symbols vaguely similar to the Israeli Star of David . For example , Swedish Three-Star matches carry a trio of six-pointed symbols , and Brazilian Antarctica ginger ale has a six-pointed star on the label , though no one in the company can remember why .
