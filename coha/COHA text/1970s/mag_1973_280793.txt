No sport stands to reason . Horsehide struck with a stick , a fuzzy object whacked over a net , an inflated sphere thrown into a metal loop - any thinking child can see the absurdities of such games . A thinking adult , of course , is another matter . The intelligent , mature , reasonable fan can see no nonsense in his favorite game . On the contrary , the more ridiculous the better . This weekend some 70 million viewers will parse and analyze the most gripping , controversial absurdity of them all : professional football . <P> Twenty-two behemoths scrambling for possession of a ball that will not even bounce decently - why should anyone care so passionately about such a scrimmage ? <P> There are almost as many answers as there are fans . But essentially , the reasons fall into four broad categories : <P> 1 ) THE SHAKESPEAREAN . In Henry IV , Prince Hal declares : " If all the year were playing holidays , to sport would be as tedious as to work . " The sheer number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most avid fans . <P> Football , as rare and regular as weekends - or Monday nights - merely whets the appetite . <P> 2 ) THE SPARTAN . As the international Olympics take on the tones of factionalism and hypocrisy , professional sport looks almost sanitary . There are no exotic pennants to salute , no speeches of sportsmanship or geopolitical ideals . <P> There is only the pitting of muscles and cerebrums , all under a single unifying principle : aggression . <P> 3 ) THE MILITARY . Every athletic contest represents some sort of war , from the King-Riggs sexual skirmish to the bloody knockdowns of professional hockey . But the very terminology of football - marches downfield , throwing the bomb , guards , strategies - recalls the Von Clausewitz spirit . For the first time in ten years the viewer , accustomed to another living-room war , can watch these armies with no sense of unrest . <P> 4 ) THE VIDEOLOGICAL . The man who has exercised the greatest influence on modern football is neither Vince Lombardi nor Don Shula . His name is Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn , spawned television . <P> Football 's first major concession to TV occurred back in 1967 , when the Super Bowl featured two kickoffs for the second half ; NBC had been in the middle of a commercial for the first boot . Today , time-outs are given for a sound athletic reason - the sponsors need time to air their messages . ( Those sponsors tackle each other for the privilege of paying up to $70,000 for a one-minute , Sunday afternoon commercial . ) The networks , with their zeppelins and zoom lenses , their dreamlike instant replays of color and violence , have changed football watching from a remote college pastime to something very much like voyeurism . <P> Indeed , the recent congressional removal of the blackout on local games proves that , given a choice , onlookers now prefer a two-dimensional view of the game .
