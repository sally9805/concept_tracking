The technologic euphoria which began about 1600 with Francis Bacon and was continued by the 18th century philosophers of the enlightenment achieved its most extreme expression among the 20th century futurologists , who took it for granted that the year 2000 would see the dawn of a technologic Utopia . <P> - Ren Dubos , Beast or Angel ? <P> <P> America 's euphoric awe of science began to ebb with the Pandoran gift to mankind of the atomic bomb . Yet the most extreme expression of the nation 's continued reverence for science and technology-dramatized in the tendency to call products " wonders " ( as in drugs ) or " miracles " ( as in fabrics ) or " magic " ( as in electronics ) - awaited the moment that a human foot first touched the moon . That feat , the President of the U.S. assured his countrymen , was to be ranked as the greatest thing since - Creation . After that exaltation , there was only one way , by the law of psychological gravity , for Sci-Tech 's prestige to go . <P> <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place has risen a new public attitude that seems the antithesis of the former awe . That awe has given way to a new skepticism , the adulation to heckling . To the bewilderment of much of the scientific community , its past triumphs have been downgraded , and popular excitement over new achievements , like snapshots from Mars , seems to wane with the closing words of the evening news . Sci-Tech 's promises for the future , far from being welcomed as harbingers of Utopia , now seem too often to be threats . Fears that genetic tinkering might produce a Doomsday Bug , for example , bother many Americans , along with dread that the SST 's sonic booms may add horrid racket to the hazards ( auto fumes , fluorocarbons , strontium 90 ) that already burden the air . <P> Increasingly this new skepticism is spreading even among professionals in the world of Sci-Tech . Indeed , it could be heard conspicuously last week as 4,200 members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science gathered in Denver for their annual brainstorming . Arthur Kantrowitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mass. , came plugging , once again , for the creation of a " science court " that might help sort out " facts from values " in controversies that have been multiplying in the atmosphere of question and dispute . One of the speakers in Denver , Science Historian June Goodfield , a visiting professor at New York 's Rockefeller University , welcomed public skepticism as a healthy development that is basically " a call for science to turn a human face toward society . " The new spirit , said Goodfield , marks the end of " mutual myths " long held by society ( about the scientist as hero ) and science ( about its freedom from obligation to society ) .
