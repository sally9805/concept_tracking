NARCOTICS <P> AT a third-floor window of a Lower Manhattan hospital , a team of federal agents huddled behind a battery of cameras . Below them , other agents strolled along the sidewalks , or cruised down Gold Street in unmarked cars . One group waited in a windowless minibus parked across the street . Not far away , another group , posing as an emergency crew , sat under a yellow canvas work tent over the open manhole in which they had set up a communications center . Precisely at 8:40 p.m. , two undercover agents drove up Gold Street in a green 1970 Cadillac . They pulled to a stop in the No Parking zone in front of the hospital-and waited . <P> Minutes later the hidden agents-there were 40 in all-got the word over their short-wave radios : " Suspects are proceeding down Spruce Street , headed for Gold . " In the third-floor observation post , one agent cracked to TIME Correspondent James Willwerth , " The Chinese are very punctual . " So they were-right on time for the most important narcotics bust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men walked up to the green Cadillac : Kenneth Kan-kit Huie , 60 , self-styled " unofficial mayor of Chinatown , " and Tim Lok , 35 , known to federal agents as " the General " for his ramrod-stiff posture . The four men-two undercover narcotics agents , and the two " connections " whom they had been trying to nail for four months-wasted no time . The agents opened the trunk of the Cadillac and showed the Chinese the contents of an olive-drab attach case inside : $200,000 in $50 and $100 bills . Then the General led one of the agents off on a meandering excursion that ended up in a Chinatown sportswear shop . There it was the agent 's turn to inspect the wares : a cardboard box packed with 14 plastic bags containing 20 Ibs. of pure No. 4 white heroin from Southeast Asia . Street value : $10 million . <P> The agent and the General then went back toward Gold Street in a taxi , followed in a gray Dodge station wagon by a third Chinese , Guan Chow-tok , bringing the heroin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled back and dropped the heroin in a vacant lot , arriving emptyhanded . He seemed worried about police . The agent and Guan argued in the street in front of Beekman Hospital for several minutes , and finally the hesitant Chinese agreed to make the deal . The four men piled into the green Cadillac and followed the gray Dodge station wagon to a dark , deserted street , under the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge . Following the General 's directions , one undercover agent walked through waist-high grass into the vacant lot . Suddenly , he knelt down and said loudly : " This is the package ; this is the package . " <P> On that signal , the night fairly exploded with armed men and flashing lights . Two unmarked cars squealed to a stop at opposite ends of the street , blocking the escape routes . Agents waving pistols and shotguns sprinted out of the shadows from all directions . Huie , the General and a fourth Chinese accomplice surrendered immediately . Guan jumped into his gray Dodge-and found himself staring into the muzzle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaning through an open window . <P> Though last week 's Chinatown bust was motion-picture perfect , to U.S. narcotics experts it was another bittersweet element in an increasingly frustrating , not to say disastrous
