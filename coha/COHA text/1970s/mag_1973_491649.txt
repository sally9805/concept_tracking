The flood of change about to crash down upon us will spread from universities and research centers to factories and offices , from the marketplace and mass media into our social relationships , from the community into the home . Penetrating deep into our private lives , it will place absolutely unprecedented strains on the family itself . The family has been called the " giant shock absorber " of society  --  the place to which the bruised and battered individual returns after doing battle with the world , the one stable point in an increasingly flux-filled environment . As the superindustrial revolution unfolds , this " shock absorber " will come in for some shocks of its own . Social critics have a field day speculating about the family . The family is " near the point of complete extinction , " says Ferdinand Lundberg , author of The Coming World Transformation . " The family is dead except for the first year or two of child raising , " according to psychoanalyst William Wolf . " This will be its only function . " Pessimists tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us what will take its place . Family optimists , in contrast , contend that the family , having existed all this time , will continue to exist . Some go so far as to argue that the family is in for a Golden Age . As leisure spreads , they theorize , families will spend more time together and will derive great satisfaction from joint activity . " The family that plays together , stays together , " etc . It may be that both sides in this debate are wrong . For the future is more open than it might appear . The family may neither vanish nor enter upon a new Golden Age . It may  --  and this is far more likely  --  break up , shatter , only to come together again in weird and novel ways . The most obviously upsetting force likely to strike the family in the decades immediately ahead will be the impact of the new birth technology . The ability to pre-set the sex of one 's baby , or even to " program " its IQ , looks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility . Embryo implants , babies grown in vitro , the ability to swallow a pill and guarantee oneself twins or triplets or , even more , the ability to walk into a " babytorium " and actually purchase embryos  --  all this reaches far beyond any previous human experience . It is regarded as somehow unscholarly , even frivolous , to discuss these matters . Yet advances in science and technology , or in reproductive biology alone , could , within a short time , smash all orthodox ideas about the family and its responsibilities . When babies can be grown in a laboratory jar , what happens to the very notion of maternity ? And what happens to the self-image of the female in societies which , since the very beginnings of man , have taught her that herprimary mission is the propagation of and nurture of the race ? Few social scientists have begun as yet to concern themselves with such questions . One who has is psychiatrist Hyman G. Weitzen , director of Neuropsychiatric Service at Polyclinic Hospital in New York . The cycle of birth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major creative need ... The special aura that glorifies the pregnant woman has figured largely in the art and literature of both East and West . " If nothing else , we are about to kill off the mystique of motherhood . Not merely motherhood , but the concept of parenthood itself may be in for radical revision , If a couple can actually purchase an embryo , then parenthood becomes a legal , not a biological matter . Furthermore , if embryos are for sale , can a corporation buy one ? Can it buy ten thousand ? Can it resell them ? And if not a corporation , how about a noncommercial research laboratory ? If we buy and sell living embryos , are we back to a new form of slavery ? Such are the nightmarish questions soon to be debated by us . To continue to think of the family , therefore , in purely conventional terms is to defy all reason . Faced by rapid social change and the staggering implications of the scientific revolution , superindustrial man may be forced to experiment with novel family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colorful variety of family arrangements . They will begin by tinkering with existing forms . One simple thing they will do is streamline the family . The typical preindustrial family not only had a good many children , but numerous other dependents as well  --  grandparents , uncles , aunts , and cousins . Such " extended " families were well suited for survival in slow-paced agricultural societies . But such families are hard to transport or transplant . They are immobile . Industrialism demanded masses of workers ready and able to move off the land in pursuit of jobs , and to move again whenever necessary . Thus the extended family gradually shed its excess weight and the so-called " nuclear " family emerged  --  a stripped-down , portable family unit consisting only of parents and a small set of children . Superindustrialism , however , the next stage of ecotechnological development , requires an even higher mobility . Thus we may expect many among the people of the future to carry the streamlining process a step further by remaining childless , cutting the family down to its most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , perhaps with matched careers , will prove more efficient at navigating through education and social shoals , through job changes and geographic relocations , than the ordinary child-cluttered family . Indeed , anthropologist Margaret Mead has pointed out that we may already be moving toward a system under which , as she puts it , " parenthood would be limited to a smaller number of families whose principal functions would be childrearing , " leaving the rest of the population " free to function  --  for the first time in history  --  as individuals . " A compromise may be the postponement of children , rather than childlessness . Men and women today are often torn in conflict between a commitment to career and a commitment to children . In the future , many couples will sidestep this problem by deferring the entire task of raising children until after retirement . This may strike people of the present as odd . Yet once childbearing is broken away from its biological base , nothing more than tradition suggests having children at an early age . Why not wait , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus childlessness is likely to spread among young and middle-aged couples ; sexagenarians who raise infants may be far more common . The post-retirement family could become a recognized social institution . If a smaller number of families raise children , however , why do the children have to be their own ? Why not a system under which " professional parents " take on the childrearing function for others ? Raising children , after all , requires skills that are by no means universal . We do n't let " just anyone " perform brain surgery or , for that matter , sell stocks and bonds . Even the lowest-ranking civil servant is required to pass tests proving competence . Yet we allow virtually anyone , almost without regard for mental or moral qualification , to try his or her hand at raising young human beings , so long as these humans are biological offspring . There are far better ways to cope with the problems of youth , but professional parenthood is certain to be proposed . Moreover , there is a powerful , pent-up demand for this social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity , would happily relinquish their parental responsibilities - and not necessarily through irresponsibility or lack of love . Harried , frenzied , up against the wall , they have come to see themselves as inadequate to the tasks . Given affluence and the existence of specially equipped and licensed professional parents , many of today 's biological parents would not only gladly surrender their children to them , but would look upon it as an act of love , rather than rejection . Parental professionals would not be therapists , but actual family units assigned to , and well paid for , rearing children . With the adults paid to be professional parents , they would be freed of the occupational necessity to relocate repeatedly . Such families would take in new children as old ones " graduate " so that age-segregation would be Continued on page 124 reduced to a minimum . The " real " or " bio-parents " could fill the role presently played by interested godparents , namely that of friendly and helpful outsiders . In such a way , the society could continue to breed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of children over to mother-father groups who are equipped , both intellectually and emotionally , for the task of caring for kids . Quite a different alternative lies in the communal family . As transience increases the loneliness and alienation in society , we can anticipate increasing experimentation with various forms of group marriage . According to some observers , there are already hundreds of open or covert communes dotting the American map . Not all , by any means , are composed of young people or hippies . Some are organized around specific goals  --  like the group , quietly financed by three East Coast colleges ? which has taken as its function the task of counseling college freshmen , helping to orient them to campus life , The goals may he social , religious , political , even recreational . In Denmark , a bill to legalize group marriage has already been introduced in the Folketing ( Parliament ) . While passage is not imminent , the act of introduction is itself a significant symbol of change . Still another type of family unit likely to win adherents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? a group marriage of elderly people drawn together in a common search for companionship and assistance . Disengaged from the productive economy that makes mobility necessary , they will settle in a single place , band together , pool funds , collectively hire domestic or nursing help , and proceed  --  within limits  --  to have the " time of their lives . " We shall , however , also see many school seal at $10.80 per pair postage . school seal at $10.00 each plus $1.50 more " family " units consisting of a single unmarried adult and one or more children . Nor will all of these adults be women . It is already possible in some places for unmarried men to adopt children . In 19 65 in Oregon , for example , a thirty-eight-yea r-old musician named Tony Piazza became the first unmarried man in that state , and perhaps in the United States , to be granted the right to adopt a baby . Courts are more readily granting custody to divorced fathers , too . At the same time , the mass media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously that men who raise children hold special interest for the public . Extremely popular television shows in recent seasons have glamorized womanless households in which men scrub floors , cook , and , most significantly , raise children . Still another family form is even now springing up in our midst , a novel childrearing unit that 1 call the " aggregate family " ? a family based on relationships between divorced and remarried couples , in which all the children become part of " one big family . " Though sociologists have paid little attention as yet to this phenomenon , it is already so prevalent that it formed the basis for a hilarious scene in a recent American movie entitled Divorce American Style . We may expect aggregate families to take on increasing importance in the decades ahead . Childless marriage , professional parenthood , postretirement child-rearing , corporate families , communes , geriatric group marriages  --  then , are a few of the family forms and practices with which innovative minorities will experiment in the decades ahead . Not all of us , however , will he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority ? Minorities experiment ; majorities cling to the forms of the past . It is safe to say that large numbers of people will refuse to jettison the conventional idea of marriage or the familiar family forms . They will , no doubt , continue searching for happiness within the orthodox format . The orthodox format presupposes that two young people will " find " one another and marry . It presupposes that the two will fulfill certain psychological needs in one another , and that the two personalities will develop over the years , more or less in tandem , so that they continue to fulfill each other 's needs . It further presupposes that this process will last " until death do us part . " These expectations are built deeply into our culture . It is no longer respectable , as it once was , to marry for anything but love . Indeed , the pursuit of love through family life has become , for many , the very purpose of life itself . Love , however , is defined in terms of this notion of shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complementary needs , flowing into and out of one another , fulfilling the loved ones , and producing feelings of warmth , tenderness and devotion . This " parallel development " theory of love carries endorsement from marriage counsellors , psychologists and sociologists . if love is a product of shared growth , however , and we are to measure success in marriage by the degree to which matched development actually occurs , it becomes possible to make a strong and ominous prediction about the future . It is possible to demonstrate that , even in a relatively stagnant society , the mathematical odds are heavily stacked against any couple achieving this ideal of parallel growth . The odds for success positively plummet , however , when the rate of change in society accelerates , as it now is doing . In a fast-moving society , in which many things change , not once , but repeatedly , in which the family is again and again torn loose from home and community , in which individuals move further from their parents , further from the religion of origin , and further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . He also doctored the negatives with various darkroom techniques to " improve " the pictures . Bodine argued that the author doctors his text and the painter dubs all sorts of extras into his sketches , so as an artist-photographer he had every right to do whatever necessary to make the photograph worthwhile . This is all very interesting , for Bodine got his first break when , as a messenger for the newspaper , lie was hired as a photographer when the man who had the job was fired for making a picture of what purported to be a wild turkey slyly photographed in the woods when , in fact , it was a domestic fowl not so cleverly tied to a nearby tree . I agree with Bodine . Truth in photographic reporting can not be distorted . Pictorial photography is artistic and the rules which permit the writer and the painter to alter the facts apply . His old friend and coworker Harold A. Williams , in a new book , A. Aubrey Bodine-A Legend in His Time says , " I think that what continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two people develop at anything like comparable rates . It is this change in the statistical odds against love that accounts for the high divorce and separation rates in most of the techno-societies . The faster the rate of change and the longer the life span , the worse these odds grow . Something has to crack . In point of fact , of course , something has already cracked- and it is the old insistence on permanence . Millions of men and women now adopt what appears to them to be a sensible and conservative strategy . Rather than opting for some offbeat variety of the family , they marry conventionally , they attempt to make it " work , " and then , when the paths of the partners diverge beyond an acceptable point , they divorce or depart . Most of them go on to search for a new partner whose developmental stage , at that moment , matches their own . As human relationships grow more transient and modular , the pursuit of love becomes , if anything , more frenzied . But the temporal expectations change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delivering on its promise of lifelong love , therefore , we can anticipate open public acceptance of temporary marriages . Instead of wedding " until death us do part , " couples will enter into matrimony knowing from the first that the relationship is likely to be short-lived . They will know , too , that when the paths of husband and wife diverge , when there is too great a discrepancy in developmental stages , he leaves out of a picture is almost as important as what he allows into it . " Although locally famous wherever the Baltimore Sun circulated , he never gained national recognition . This was not true in photographic circles where he was well known by amateur and press photographers . His photographs have won a host of honors and awards . Of 51,038 entries in Popular Photography 's 1948 annual contest , a Bodine picture of oyster dredgers took first prize and $5,000 . The next year he copped second prize in the same contest with 53,554 entries . in 1953 the National Press Photographers ' Association named him a " Fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most successful of which is Chesapeake Bay and Tidewater . However , his photographs have been widely used in all kinds of publications . I am delighted that the Saturday Evening Post is reproducing these fine examples of Bodine 's photography through the courtesy of his widow , Nancy Tait Bodine. a they may call it quits-without shock or embarrassment , perhaps even without some of the pain that goes with divorce today . And when the opportunity presents itself , they will marry again , .. and again ... and again , In one sense , serial marriage is already the best kept family secret of the techno-societies . According to Professor Jessie Bernard , a world-prominent family sociologist , " Plural marriage is more extensive in our society today than it is in societies that permit polygamy- the chief difference being that we have institutionalized plural marriage serially or sequentially rather than contemporaneously . " Remarriage is already so prevalent a practice that nearly one out of every four bridegrooms in America has been to the altar before . It is so prevalent that one IBM personnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , in filling out a job application , paused when she came to the question of marital status . She put her pencil in her mouth , pondered for a moment , then wrote : " Unremarried . " Even young people who most passionately seek commitment , profound involvement with people and causes , recognize the power of the thrust toward transience . As serial marriages become more common , we shall begin to characterize people not in terms of their present marital status , but in terms of their marriage career or " trajectory . " This t rajectory will be formed by the decisions they make at certain vital turning points in their lives . For most people , the first such juncture will arrive in youth , when they enter into " trial marriage . " In the past , social pressures and lack of money restricted experimentation with trial marriage to a relative handful . In the future , both these limiting forces will evaporate . Trial marriage will be the first step in the serial marriage " careers " that millions will pursue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future will occur when the trial marriage ends . At this point , couples may choose to formalize their relationship and stay together into the next stage . Or they may terminate it and seek out new partners . In either case , they will then face several options . They may prefer to go childless . They may choose to have , adopt or " buy " one or more children . They may decide to raise these children themselves or to farm them out to professional parents . Such decisions will be made , by and large , in the early twenties  --  by which time many young adults will already be well into their second marriages . A third significant turning point in the marital career will come , as it does today , when the children finally leave home . The end of parenthood proves excruciating for many , particularly women who , once the children are gone , find themselves without a raison d ' ? tre . Even today divorces result from the failure of the couple to adapt to this traumatic break in continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise their own children in the time-honored fashion , this will continue to be a particularly painful time . It will , however , strike earlier . Young people today already leave home sooner than their counterparts a generation ago . They will probably depart even earlier tomorrow . Thus we may anticipate that the middle and late thirties will be another important breakpoint in the marital careers of millions . Many at that juncture will enter into their third marriage . This third marriage will bring together two people for what could well turn out to be the longest uninterrupted stretch of matrimony in their lives  --  from , say , the late thirties until one of the partners dies . This may , in fact , turn out to be the only " real " marriage , the basis of the only truly durable marital relationship . During this time two mature people , presumably with well-matched interests and complementary psychological needs , and with a sense of being at comparable stages of ' personality development , will be able to look forward to a relationship with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will he some who , through luck , interpersonal skill and high intelligence , will find it possible to make long-lasting monogamous marriages work . Some will succeed , as they do today , in marrying for life and finding durable love and affection . But others will fail to ma ke even sequential marriages Continued on page 128 continued from page 177 endure for long . Thus some will try two or even three partners within , say , the final stage of marriage . Across the board , the average number of marriages per capita will rise-slowly but relentlessly . Most people will probably move forward along this progression , engaging in one " conventional " temporary marriage after another . But with widespread fa milial experimentation in the society , the more daring or desperate will make side forays into less conventional arrangements as well , perhaps experimenting with communal life at some point , or going it alone with a child . The net result will be a rich variation in the types of marital trajectories that people will trace , a wider choice of life-patterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be more common than others . But temporary marriage will he a standard feature , perhaps the dominant feature , of family life in the future . A world in which marriage is temporary rather than permanent , in which family arrangements are diverse and colorful-such a world is vastly different from our own . Today all boys and girls are expected to find lifelong partners . In tomorrow 's world , being single will be no crime . Nor will couples be forced to remain imprisoned , as so many still are today , in marriages that have turned rancid . Divorce will be easy to arrange , so long as responsible provision is made for children . Those who stay together would be those who wish to stay together , those for whom marriage is actively fulfilling-those , in short , who are in love . Children in this super-industrial society will grow up with an ever enlarging circle of what might be called " semi-siblings " -a whole clan of boys and girls brought into the world by their successive sets of parents . What becomes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Semi-sibs may turn out to he like cousins , today . They may help one another professionally or in time of need . But they will also present the society with novel problems . Should semi-sibs marry , for example ? Surely , the whole relationship of the child to the family will be dramatically altered . Except perhaps in communal groupings , the family will lose what little remains of its power to transmit values to the younger generation . This will further accelerate the pace of change and intensify the problems that go with h it . Looming over all such changes , however . and even dwarfing them in significance is something far more subtle , Seldom discusser , there is a hidden rhythm m human affairs that until now has served as one of the key stabilizing forces in society : the family cycle . We begin as children ; we mature . we leave the parental nest : we give birth to children who , in turn , grow up , leave and begin the process all over again . This cycle has been operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularity , that men have taken it for granted . it is part of the human landscape . Long before they reach puberty , children learn the part they are expected to play in keeping this great cycle turning . This predictable succession of family events has provided all men , of whatever tribe or society , with a sense of continuity , a place in the temporal scheme of things . The family cycle has been one of the sanity-preserving constants in human existence . Today this cycle is accelerating . We grow up sooner , leave home sooner , marry sooner , have children sooner . In the words of Dr. Bernice Neugarten , a University of Chicago specialist on family development , " The trend is toward a more rapid rhythm of events through most of the family cycle . " But if industrialism , with its faster pace of life , has accelerated the family cycle , superindustrialism now threatens to smash it altogether . We shall not merely run the cycle more rapidly ; we shall introduce irregularity , suspense , unpredictability-in a word . novelty-into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Children will grow up into a world in which the family cycle , once so smooth and sure , will be jerkily arhylhmic . Another crucial stabilizer will have been removed from the wreckage of the old order , another pillar of sanity broken . There is , of course , nothing inevitable about the developments traced in the preceding pages , We have it in our power to shape change . We may choose one future over another . We can not , however , maintain the past . As we hurtle into tomorrow , millions of ordinary men and women will face emotion-packed options so unfamiliar , so untested , that past experience will otter little clue to wisdom . In their family ties , as in all other aspects of their lives , they will be compelled to cope not merely with transience. but with the adder problem of change as well . 7 .
