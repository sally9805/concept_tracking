Bomb Bursting <P> TWILIGHT 'S LAST GLEAMING <P> Directed by ROBERT ALDRICH Screenplay by RONALD M. COHEN and EDWARD HUEBSCH <P> If your yearning for the good old anxieties of yesteryear-that is , the late ' 50s and early ' 60s-is simply uncontrollable , you could do worse than spend a couple of hours with Twilight 's Last Gleaming . In it , a gang of desperate men seize a SAC missile silo in the Far West and threaten to unleash its contents on Russian targets , thus precipitating World War III , unless the President of the U.S. accedes to their demands . <P> Instantly one is reminded of Fail Safe , Seven Days in May and various other pop-cult expressions of former doomsday fears . This sense of deja vu is enhanced by the casting of that archetypal movie star of the ' 50s , Burt Lancaster , as the leading trespasser on Government property . His SAC nemesis is Richard Widmark , still energizing his performances with a subtle suggestion of psychopathy . Playing the President 's closest advisers are such good , gray actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is all rather comforting to see these old companions in adventure from bygone matinees . Director Aldrich , a veteran purveyor of thrills in all the low-caste genres , knows how to work this territory , nipping lightly on the nerve endings in the early going , then settling down for a protracted gnaw at them as the clocks tick toward the deadline set by the blackmailers . <P> Then the whole enterprise unravels , mostly because of an ill-considered at tempt to make a statement about contemporary issues . Lancaster is a cashiered Air Force general , unhinged by his experiences as a P.O.W. in Viet Nam . <P> What he wants the people in Washington to do is to release classified docu ments , which " prove " that the war was needlessly prolonged in order to lend " credibility " to U.S. protestations of cold war military toughness . <P> This is not exactly news . At this late date , one would be hard-pressed to find anyone who is unaware of that accusation . Yet the movie assumes that a President ( nicely played by Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shocked speechless by this revelation and his advisers would conspire to have him assainated rather than let him acknowledge something everyone knows . There is all kind of talk about the country 's not being able to stand the shock , but the script insists on quoting some of the infamous documents that are preying on Lancaster 's mind . There is nothing in them worth picking up a picket sign to protest , let alone knocking over a missile base . In short , the movie 's not in considerable possibilities for innocent entertainment are undercut by the feckless desire of small minds to make a big statement . R.S.
