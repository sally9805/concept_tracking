To the Roman Catholic Church , abortion is officially a grave sin . How to combat it effectively is a problem that has been troubling the nation 's Catholic bishops ever since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its liberalized ruling on abortion early in 1973 . While oft-shrill , heavily Catholic " right-to-life " committees waged political battles against abortion on all fronts , the bishops largely confined themselves to statements reaffirming church teachings and to limited lobbying in support of some kind of constitutional amendment that would nullify the court 's action . <P> All that changed last week as 255 bishops , at the church hierarchy 's 1975 meeting in Washington , D.C. , approved a new anti-abortion strategy , a " Pastoral Plan for Pro-Life Activities . " The plan marks a sharp shift from uncoordinated , at times strident opposition to abortion to a more reasoned and concerted attack on it . The bishops not only called for a parish-to national-level effort by Catholics but ventured into new territory . They proposed the formation of interdenominational " prolife " groups in all 435 congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 decision . <P> Adamant Opposition . In their effort to broaden the base of their anti-abortion drive , and to mollify potential critics , the bishops were careful to say that the interdenominational campaign is not being run as " an agency of the church , nor is it operated , controlled or financed by the church . " Instead , in the studied , ecumenical language of the plan , " it is an agency of the citizens . " Obviously , the bishops not only hope to win the backing of anti-abortion Protestants and Jews but also realize that without them an amendment has little chance of adoption . <P> Before the bishops can convert others to their cause , however , they are going to have to do some educating within their own flock . Admits Bishop James Rausch , general secretary of the conference : " Many of our people are n't sure what the church 's positions are . " Actually , the church 's positions clearly add up to adamant opposition to abortion . Many Catholics , however , are relatively tolerant of abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's life is endangered . <P> While not in any way retreating from the church 's total condemnation of abortion , the bishops have recognized political reality and now call upon government to protect " the unborn child to the maximum degree possible . " The " maximum-degree-possible " approach may fall short of the ideal , but to the bishops it has the virtue of being attainable.
