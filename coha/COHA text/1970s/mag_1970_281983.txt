A quarter of a century ago , the exhausted and half-leveled Continent of Europe declared an end to World War II . It was V-E day , the moment of Nazi Germany 's unconditional surrender to the Allied forces of the U.S. , Britain and the Soviet Union . In retrospect , May 8 , 1945 , was not the joyous release from conflict that it seemed to anyone who still remembers that bright spring day .

Official Soviet histories continue to condemn his political " excesses " during the Great Purges of the 1930s .
