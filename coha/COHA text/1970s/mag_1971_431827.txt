 | PERHAPS ARPAD GAVE US THE IDEA , for we had read the folklore of that nomadic Magyar chieftain . Before he stormed into Hungary with his conquering horsemen in A.D. 896 , Arpad dispatched scouts ahead to bring back " two pitchers full of water from the Danube and a bundle of grass from the dunes , " reported a medieval historian . And from those samples the chieftain formed his opinion of the land now known as Hungary . Like Arpad 's scouts , we collected souvenirs all over the land , and as we packed , our loot itself told the story of Hungary today . We had gathered cookbooks , wine , and records of Gypsy violins and Bartok concertos ? proof of delicious , romantic fun . We had also acquired some needlework , fine china , a riding crop , a humor magazine called Ludas Matyi , and some medals marking the centennial of Lenin and the millennium of St. Stephen .

Melodic verbunkos helped recruit the army , and for centuries Gypsy violinists led troops into battle . Hungarian dictionaries even note some special words for Gypsies : cigdnyozni ( literally Gypsying ) and mulatni ( to have a good time with Gypsies ) . In fact , Gypsy music has been such a festive part of historic Hungarian revels that Communist authorities at first banished the traditional orchestras as aristocratic symbols .

In his speech , the president praised " the statesmanship of the state-founding Stephen . " Together the prelates and the party functionaries applauded . No one mentioned Jozsef Cardinal Mindszenty , Primate of Hungary , who since 1456 has preferred refuge in the United States . Embassy to exile . Likewise , no one seemed to notice that the ceremony had no precise precedent in any Marxist land . " We 're hopeful , " remarked Dr. Ulrik Monsberger , prior of the Benedictine Pannonhalma Abbey .

We drove around easily from hilly Sopron near Austria ( " on good days we see the Alps " ) to Debrecen , the " Hungarian Calvinists ' Rome , " on the eastern plains . Only a shortage of hotel rooms proved a problem . " But do n't worry , " said Peter . " In Sopron , we can stay with my aunts . They are tailors , and they have a large apartment .

Traveling along the Danube , we got another kind of insight : into modern Hungarian industry and its close ties to the U.S.S.R.

"  |p466  " No mountain rivers for generating power . Yet we have solved that problem ; we reduce the bauxite to alumina and ship it by train to the U.S.S.R. The Russians process it with their cheap electricity and return finished aluminum to us . Within six or seven years Hungary will produce a million tons of alumina each year . " FARTHER SOUTH , near Szeged , we turned off toward the new Algyo oil field . A red-letter sign proclaimed " 978,000 tons of oil greets our Tenth Party Congress .

Hungary almost lost this oil field last spring . " Our elevation here is the lowest in Hungary , " said Mr. Juratovits , " and , you can see , the Tisza River cuts right beside us . Well , in full flood the Tisza rose 32 feet ? the highest water in recorded history ? enough to submerge us completely . The army brought sandbags ; 20,000 volunteers pitched in . In one week we built a new riverbank here with 90,000 cubic yards of earth . Then 70 frogmen lined that bank with plastic , so the Tisza would not undermine it . The floodwaters remained from May 20 until July 1 . We barely slept . But we saved Algyo . " Between our industrial stops , as we drove across flat Hungary , Peter kept Josh entertained with a large supply of student jokes . All Hungarians collect jokes : Lenin jokes , as we had already noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jokes about a certain Ivan Ivanovitch . In a special way such stories show how Hungarians feel about life , letters , and authority ; Josh doubled up laughing at all of them . But he quickly grew serious each time we passed a castle . At the town of Siklos , we rattled across a drawbridge and checked into the castle itself . " It 's real ! " Josh shouted . " Built before 1294 ? see the plaque ? " Only 13 refurbished rooms were ready for renting , but ours measured 40 feet square by 20 feet high .

" It costs only 15 forints to stay here ? 50 cents a night , " he reported . " Good for students . " I agreed . Castle accommodations with a clean cot and indoor plumbing fetch similar sums all over Hungary . Near Sopron , the 126-room Eszterhazy Palace of Fertod ?

In the country , you can often tell Hungarians ' ageby their girth ? like a tree-ring system . Lard . onions , paprika , and flour provide the base for most Hungarian dishes .

" We consume more calories than anyone else in central Europe , " one Hungarian boasted . " More than 3,000 a day . " Thereafter , I tried switching to saccharine-flavored espresso ? the fresh , steaming coffee essence that people sip all day long . " The Hungarian used to drink tea , " a friend told me . " Then one day a waiter asked him , Do you want Russian tea or Chinese tea ? ' Toddling hand in hand , children follow teachers from a day-care school to a nearby park .

Most welcome the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both husband and wife usually must be breadwinners , and those with an appetite for consumer goods hold two and even three jobs . Easing the income squeeze , Hungary 's Marxist regime provides free medical care and secondary-school education , paid vacations , and old-age pensions . Hungary in 1968 launched its bold New Economic Mechanism . The plan revived the sagging staterun economy with such unabashedly capitalist devices as measuring a plant 's success by the money it makes , and generating worker incentive through profit sharing . Well , ' he answered , just bring me coffee . ' " Besides fine food and drink , other aristocratic pleasures flourish in the People 's Republic . Great hunting preserves once owned by noble families have simply changed management . " Hunting was discouraged after World War II , " said young Bela Berdar , of the Ministry of Agriculture . " But the wild game multiplied dangerously . Now we must reduce this surplus with a 10-year plan : from 32,000 deer to 20,000 , from 140,000 roe deer to 100,000 , from 14,000 wild boar to 7,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the refurbished huntinglodges to bag trophies and leave behind 474  |p475  ) 0 a year in hard currencies .

My mother once sent me a food package that included a red pepper . I saved that beautiful pepper and looked at it until it rotted . I promised myself then to work for nature when I got out ? and so I went into the forestry service . " In the same spirit , we sought the open spaces of the flat , wide puszta to meet a friend , Mrs. Dorothy Grant , at Hortobagy . The owner of a riding stable in Washington , D. C. , Dorothy Grant has organized horseback tours of Hungary for five summers now ( above ) . " Towns are just the right distal ) , apart , " she says . " And these farms have ' - fences to jump .

So , at the state farm stables , he mounted a bay gelding 173 centimeters tall " More than 17 hands , " Josh calculated in apprehensive awe . " Do n't worry , your son can handle him . ' " said Tamas Flandorffer . A former hussar officer , Mr. Flandorffer started Hungary ' ,  |p477  Across a purple plain , visitors from the United States see Hungary on horseback . Led each summer by Mrs. Dorothy Grant of Washington , D. C. , small tour groups ride for two to three weeks over a countryside rich in history and beauty . Here on Lake Balaton 's Tihany Peninsula , they cross a field of lavender ; when ripe , the flowers will be harvested for their fragrant oil . postwar breeding stables and the crosscountry horseback tours that bring 500 lucky riders here each year . " We keep the tours small and individual , " Mr. Flandorffer explained . " We have a tradition . " " Indeed they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ride a steep trail up to a castle drawbridge ? climbing steps that were spaced for the stride of 13th-century Hungarian horses . Ours follow the same hoofprints . " " Your son 's horse is called Bulcsu , " said Mr. Flandorffer . " That was the name of a  |p479  Magyar chieftain from the time of Arpad . " Through history , almost all the country 's conquerors have come by horseback , and as we watched Dorothy 's group quickly ride off ? and they were visible for miles on the oceanic horizon ? I could understand the horseman 's advantage here . He could swiftly traverse this terrain to rule or plunder , according to his pleasure . With the horseback invasions came the great variety we noticed in Hungarian faces . Yet the marshy puszta was often spared the worst of the wars . Not until the 19th century did engineers transform this great flood plain . Then 300,000 people worked here to build dams and dig drainage canals for " the world 's largest civil-engineering project in that century , " as economic geographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ended in the 1890 's , " he adds , " many of those people emigrated to Canada and the U.S.A. " In a one-horse buckboard , we drove around the wide , flat pastures , stopping at water holes to see herds of gray long-horned cattle . Here I met some csikos , the native Hun.rarian horsemen . " You want to see us do our stunts ? " one csikos asked . Proudly he ordered his neat cow pony to lie flat ; then , standing atop his patient mount , he expertly cracked a horsewhip like a rifle ? and in perfect rhythm . I envied the csikos his nimble way of mounting a horse , for he uses no girth on his saddle . But the small , lonely wagon where the csikos sheltered I envied not at all . USZTA LIFE has always been isolated . P Author Gyula Illyes has written , " I still remember the stark , palpitatingastonishment that gripped me ... when at the age of eight or nine I first entered a village . The . treets , the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement and terror .... Up to that time I had never seen two houses deliberately built in line .... " My colleague Joseph Scherschel , taking photographs in the Hungarian hinterlands , recently ran into cases of similar isolation . Joe , whose mother was Hungarian , recalled a few phrases of greeting . " Why does the Fresh from Hungary 's inland sea , Lake Balaton f spotted foga , esteemed above all others , partially fil lake 's 230 square miles lure throngs of summer va @# photographer speak so strangely ? " an old farmer asked Joe 's translator . " He is a foreigner , " the translator replied . In deep puzzlement , the old man then asked , " And what is a foreigner ? " It came as a shock that in such a modern country this question could still be asked . Hungary , after all , has given America conductor Eugene Ormandy , entertainer Zsa Zsa Gabor , and physicist Edward Teller , and the forebears of quarterback Joe Namath and publisher Joseph Pulitzer ? a disparate but obviously gifted crowd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokingly toasted me with the famous Latin maxim ? " Extra Hungariam non est vita , si est vita , non est ita . " ( Roughly , and in rhyme : " Outside Hungary , no life you 'll find . And if you do , it 's not our kind . " ) HUNGARIANS have withstood outside pressure only with strong cultural defenses . A hard language helps . " Our code , " laughs Rudi Vig , but he adds affectionately , " If only our poets could be properly translated , they would be as famous as composers like Kodaly and Bartok . " Foreigners , however , will not soon master such single glued-together tongue twisters as **36;949;TOOLONG . ( It means " to the most irreconcilable ones . " ) One engineer told me , " Do n't bother with the name of our bauxite mine ? no foreign journal has ever spelled it correctly . " On behalf of the Society 's typesetters , I accept his challenge , though nervously : The mine is named Iszkaszentgyorgy ? Iszka Saint George . Behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emotions ? whether of love or anger ? find easy outlet . " We are quick-tempered ? a straw-flame people , " says Miklos Rabai , leader of the famous Folk-Dance Ensemble . " We are small , but like pepper . " With all the changes in their land , the Hungarian character prevails . And most of all , the national personality asserts itself in small villages . With Rudi Vig we visited Bogacs , the village near Eger where Rudi himself grew up . We passed a cluster of old ish pass from boat to dockside sorting bins . 1 the basket in foreground . The fresh-water , cationists ; resort facilities line its beaches .  |p483  men smoking pipes under a locust tree . " Our parliament is debating world affairs , " he laughed . Rudi introduced me to the village elders , to his cousins and aunts , and even to the Gypsies who live on the outskirts of town . " I remember that narrow walled street ? always useful for the drunks , " said Rudi . " Yet there are changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngsters . " Recorded music shook the windowpanes while village youths danced . " We were always more shy in visiting the girls . " Each village changes at its own pace . In Zsambok , population about 300 , we stopped to watch the tomato harvest , met the postwoman as she delivered the mail -- and got invited to a wedding . Our invitations were better than engraved . Here guests are invited by superbly embroidered lace-trimmed handkerchiefs that they then pin to their shirts . THE BRIDE , Margit Povazsonyi , came from Toalmas , a village three miles away and considered quite progressive . The groom , Erazmus Toth , was the son of a Zsambok widow who embroiders fokoto caps for a living . We met at the bride 's house , danced to a country band , and ? before leaving for the church ? sat down to a huge paprika-flavored feast . " How can you stay so slim ? " I asked our pretty bride . " I pick many tomatoes , " Margit laughed . But she also has worked in Budapest ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the traditionalists from Zsambok . The women came in big swirling skirts with bright embroidery and lace , as they have done for generations . " Let 's start for the church , in the name of God , " the best man declaimed in verse . So we walked through streets where flocks of geese had left wedge-shaped footprints in the dust . After the wedding Mass , Margit took leave of her parents , while the best man recited more verse ( " My mother , I have much pain in my heart ... " ) . Everyone shed tears , including the groom , and some relatives sobbed loudly . But tears dried quickly ; we returned to Zsambok and the groom 's house to find a six-piece band , pitchers of beer and wine and a second feast . The bride herself served us , but only between tunes , for men paid money to dance a csardas with her . " The bride is mine ! " they would shout , and dance away , one-two , one-two , sweating away their beer . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as jolly as any of us . " You must not leave until you eat some more ! " insisted the groom 's mother . But this time we could not ; the evening had been full ? and so were we . Hungarian life goes on , full of noise and tears and laughter . And in a land with strong customs and strong tempers , no proletarian dictatorship can long be considered total . " What is the difference between an optimist and a pessimist ? " asks the comic in a Budapest political cabaret . With a twist of lemon , the answer comes back : " A pessimist is better informed . " When a comic can publicly say such things , he makes me optimistic . And I know I have n't been brainwashed . Heartwashed , perhaps .
