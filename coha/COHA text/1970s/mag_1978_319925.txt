SHORT STORIES : FIVE DECADES by Irwin Shaw Delacorte ; 756 pages ; $14.95 <P> In the introduction to his collected stories John Cheever recalls a crusty , idiosyncratic editor at The New Yorker . But , adds the author , " since the men he encouraged ranged as widely as Irwin Shaw and Vladimir Nabokov , he seems to have done more good than anything else . " Cheever may be the only person in the world who would mention these writers in the same sentence . There are many who would not mention Shaw at all . Alfred Kazin 's massive study of American fiction , On Native Grounds , has no room for the author . Edmund Wilson 's definitive survey , Classics and Commercials , gives space to only one Shaw : George Bernard Today the Irwin Shaw Show means more than the Irwin Shaw books : Rich Man , Poor Man has eclipsed his previous works and further diminished his literary reputation . That is a mixed curse : the TV miniseries was comic-book melodrama ; yet , without its success , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a short-story master might have been missed . <P> All of which is fine with the author , who shuttles between Switzerland and New York . At 65 , he cherishes few illusions . " I am , " he says simply , " a product of my times . " Shaw spent five decades writing big movies and novels ( The Young Lions , Lucy Crown ) and unprofitable short fiction , because " in a novel or a play you must be a whole man . In a collection of stories you can be all the men or fragments of men , worthy and unworthy , who in different seasons abound in you . It is a luxury not to be scorned . " <P> Or ignored . In the ' 30s Shaw sang a chant of social significance ; the tales are filled with laborers and struggling families indistinguishable from Clifford Odets or Arthur Miller characters . But by the ' 40s he had found his own voice , a Shavian mix of irony and poignance . Since then the supple prose has been , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to lend common experiences and ordinary people a secular grace . <P> In The Girls in Their Summer Dresses a womanizer 's roving eye finally set ties on the most beautiful legs in the room : his wife's-a comment on male sexuality that says more than any behaviorist manual . Act of Faith , in which a Jewish soldier trades in a pistol to treat his Christian buddies to drinks , is an explanation of the Masada complex that remains undated . Mixed Doubles , the story of a couple whose on-court skirmishes reveal a betrayed trust , seems doubly acute in a time of Inner Tennis . <P> Unfortunately , these 63 polished works tend to turn self-mockery up to full volume : " Present it in a pitiful light . Three combat-scarred veterans , who fought their way from Omaha Beach to- what was the name of the town we fought our way to ? " Or : " What sort of poetry do you write ? " " Lyric , elegiac , and athletic In praise of youth , death , and anarchy . Very good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
