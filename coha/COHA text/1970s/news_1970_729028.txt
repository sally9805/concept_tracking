txt The military judge in the murder trial of First Lieut . William . L. Calley Jr . opened the way today for testimony by key , prosecution witnesses who were barred from taking the stand at the trial of another defendant in the alleged massacre of South Vietnamese civilians at Mylai . It was a serious legal setback for Lieutenant Calley , whose counsel had hoped that the judge , Col. Reid W. Kennedy , would follow the ' ruling last month of Col. George B. Robinson in the trial of Staff Sgt. David Mitchell at Fort Hood , Tex . When a House Armed Services subcommittee refused to release testimony given at closed hearings on the incident in South Vietnam , Colonel Robinson ruled out testimony by any witnesses who had appeared at those hearings . Colonel Robinson based his ruling on a 1957 law , the Jencks Act , permitting defense counsel to search for inconsistencies between a witness 's // trial testimony and previous statements " in possession of the United States . " In the contrary ruling today , Colonel Kennedy said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional committee . He said he had asked the Speaker of the House to provide transcripts of the testimony . Congress is in recess until next week and the subcommittee chairman , F. Edward Hebert , Democrat or Louisiana , has said he will not release the testimony unless instructed by the House as a whole . But Colonel Kennedy said the trial would not be delayed ; the prosecution is expected to open its case on Monday . At the final pretrial hearing this morning , George W. Latimer , chief counsel for Lieutenant Calley , warned Colonel Kennedy that a ruling contrary to Colonel Robinson 's would be " almost a travesty . " " This is not a game , " Mr. Latimer said . " A man 's life is at stake and you should not reject that Robinson finding : : Mr. Latimer said that the subcommittee 's hearings on the Mylai incident were " the only independent investigation , " an investigation " untainted and untouched " by the Army , and that it was imperative for him to see the testimony of all witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over one prospective witness , Ronald Haeberle , a formdr combat photographer . Mr. Latimer said that Mr : Haeberle 's pictures , " whether real or faked , " of dead and dying women and children allegedly shot by Lieutenant Calley would make " an indelible impression . " Pilot May Testify Another Hebert suAcommittee witness whose testimony will probably be heard here is Chief Warrant Officer Hugh C. Thompson of Decatur , Ga. , a helicopter pilot who says he was an eyewitness to the alleged massacre on March 16 , 1968 , and has said he vainly pleaded with Lieutenant Calley to halt the killings . Lieutenant Calley is accused of slaying at least 102 unarmed civilians in the Mylai 4 hamlet of the village of Sonmy . Colonel Kennedy , in his ruling , said that if the House eventually releases the transcripts of the subcommittee witnesses v/lo- appear here , these witnesses will be recalled for direct or cross-examination on any discrepancies in their testimony . Earlier , Colonel Kennedy ruled against a motion , by the prosecutor , Capt . Aubrey Marshall Daniel 3d , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calley 's actions were a result of orders from superior officers and were relevant to the ferocious climate of a free-fire zone . In such a zone , soldiers may ' shoot at anything that moves . ' he added , " that he Calley rounded up unarmed , unresisting old men , women and children and summarily executed these people . " ' Gag Rule ' Disputed Captain Daniel also wanted the court to rule out any argument by the defense that the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese committed frequent atrocities . " Talk about a gag rule ! " exploded Mr. Latimer when the prosecutor had finished . " If this motion were granted I might as well go home . " He said that " retribution " for enemy atrocities was ' recognized as a " material matter " under " the laws of the United States Army . " ' He said he had a right to explore the combat climate in which Lieutenant Calley and his platoon were under orders to " search and destroy ? kill everything including civilians to carry out their mission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operation Phoenix , a counterterrorist program by the Central Intelligence Agency , might have " changed the mental processes " of men like Lieutenant Calley . Lieutenant Calley , accused of premeditated murder , would be sentenced either to death or life imprisonment if found guilty . Colonel Kennedy told Mr. Latimer that he could tell the jury of Army officers , whose selection will begin Thursday , that this was a capital case . But he could not tell the panel that the only alternative was life imprisonment . Maj : Kenneth A. Raby , military defense council , charged today that the commanding officer of Fort Benning , Maj. Gen. Orwin C. Talbott , had stacked a court-martial panel against Lieutenant Calley by excluding young Army combat officers . Three members of the 10-man panel have been attached to an assault helicopter command in Vietnam and would thus be inclined to favor the testimony of helicopter pilots who said they had witnessed the alleged atrocity , Major Raby said . But his request for a mistrial or referral of the case to another court-martial board was denied .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
