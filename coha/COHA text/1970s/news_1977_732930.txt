txt In renewing today his plea for the public to accept discomfort and chilly rooms by conserving heating fuel , President Carter was embarking on an early test of his personal leadership . It was a test that conformed to his own views of the Presidency . Repeatedly in his long political campaign he had said that only the President could speak for the Government " with a clear and simple voice " and that " in the absence of Presi , dential leadership , there is no leader'ship . " Mr. Carter transmitted to Congress today a complex piece of legislation the Emergency Natural Gas Act of 1977 , in which he proposed legal measures that could help ease the gas shortage that has crippled some industries and shut off gas to some homes . But his call for voluntary public restraint in fuel consumption was , in fact , the most important single component of his program for dealing with the emergency . Partly for that reason , Mr. Carter , dressed in a somber blue suit and a red patterned necktie , walked into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarks on the energy crisis could be recorded for television and achieve greater impact in newspapers . " The severity of the present emergency will be significantly reduced if Americans respond to my request of Jan. 21 to turn down their thermostats to 65 degrees in the daytime and lower at night , " the President said . He added that ' half the shortage of natural gas can be made up through such action , thereby decreasing unemployment and reducing the possibility that some American homes might be completely without heat this winter . " James R. Schlesinger , the President 's energy adviser , later said that the Administration was as yet unsure of how effective had been the original appeal by Mr. Carter last Friday , which took the form of a written statement urging a reduction in home temperatures , but he said that the White House was gathering data . Mr. Carter sent telegrams to the governors of the states today , urging them to join with him in exhorting citizens to turn down thermostats and to conserve fuel .

In another symbolic demonstration of the style , and perhaps the substance , of the new Administration , Mr. Carter looked on this morning as his Attorney General , Griffin B. Bell , opened the massive steel doors of the main entrance of the Department of Justice . The doors had been closed and locked at the time of antiwar demonstrations in the term of President Nixon , and Mr. Carter said today , " I do n't doubt the need for it at the time . " The doors had been locked , he said , " because of a chasm that developed between our Government and many of our people " and added it had been " a symbolic separation of both disaffected and disadvantaged people from the core of justice . " " A few minutes ago Griffin Bell opened those doors , " Mr. Carter said , " They are going to be kept open . " The President was speaking at the swearing-in ceremony of the 58-year-old Mr. Bell , who was the most controversial of Mr. Carter 's Cabinet appointments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 75 to 21 . Mr. Carter also met this morning with the two top officials of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations  --  George Meany , the labor federation president , and Lane Kirkland , its secretary-treasurer . The White House released no official account of the hour-long breakfast meeting , but one source suggested that the labor leaders raised their publicly expressed disapproval of the size and character of Mr. Carter 's program to stimulate the economy . The labor leaders have called for a one-year program costing about $30 billion and concentrating more on direct job creation than on tax rebates and tax reductions . As the President was leaving the White House today for the ceremony at the Department of Justice he slipped on a patch of ice near his waiting limousine and , precariously balancing for an instant on one foot , avoided falling .
