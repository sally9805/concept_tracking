txt WASHINGTON , May 22 . ? Unseen apparently by office boys , receptionists , secretaries , building guards , in short , by the whole apparatus meant to shelter us from humanity , he had slipped into the office and had his sample cases open on the floor in a flash . " The latest machipe . . . " he began . He extracted a box which looked metallic but was actually - made of a chemical compound ; the name of which ended in cane . Perhaps it was epicene . No , it was epistocene . " This is the new miracle epistocene casing , " he explained . His voice was a , recorded announcement It was badly worn , and it immediately began- , repeating , " miracle epistocene epistocene casing , , miracle epistocene casing . " A hard slap ? on the , back got it going again . " Goes with . you ' anyplace , " his voice insisted , " To office , beach or that big business trip you 've been planning . " It was galling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine . Or a machine that looked like a man . You could n't tell any ; more , when somebody came into the office , whether to offer him a seat or oil him . " Go away . I have no time for machines todaY , . " " Simply place it on the lap , press OBSERVER ' the energizer. button , deflect the activator , throw the solenoid intake retractor outlet switch and . , . " " Will you , please and for the last time , get out of here before I pour water in your hop hinges ? " " . ... and , " he continued , soullessly , " it will disintegrate anybody you want disintegrated . " The foot that was poised to kick him or it out of the office stayed from the swift execution of its owner 's intent upon hearing these last words , which the salesman , or salesthing , began repeating from its worn groove . " . . . Anybody you want disintegrated , anybody you want disintegrated , anybody you want . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh groove . He said he was now prepared to answer certain questions which , market surveys showed , potential buyers were most likely to ask . " Did you say that this box will disintegrate anybody I want disintegrated ? " " I did indeed . " " Does it hurt ? " , " Such questions need not arise for the lucky owner of the Little Wonder Automatic Remote Miracle Human Disintegrating Machine , " the recorded pitch replied . " Because it works at distances of more than five miles from the person to be disintegrated , or the ' eliminee , ' as we refer , to this unfortunate individual , the user of the machine need never know whether the disintegration has caused the eliminee the slightest degree of discomfort . " " You mean that I would n't have to go in close in order to use it effectively ? So close that I 'd have , to see ? well , whatever the thing does to the ? to the eliminee ? " The salesman 's programed answer to this question was stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eliminator than there would be in , say , hitting a rabbit at .70 miles an hour on a turnpike at , night . " He smiled , and this . made it apparent that , his face was aluminum , or perhaps ' a new miracle Plastic , because the laugh lines around the eyes creaked as they opened and closed . It was silly talking to this machine about another machine , and yet-well , did n't everybody talk to , machines regularly ? Just because they didn't. usually look like people ... . " I ca n't stand the sight of ? you know  --  people suffering . Limbs . slowly vanishing in the disintegration , process  --  ugh ! You 'd have ' to be inhuman to be able to take that . . no offense intended , of course . " " We are aware , we are aware , we are aware , we are . . . " A punch in the back . " . . aware that no civilized man could bring himself to disintegrate an eliminee at close range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire disintegration from such great distances . " What could a man do ? People all over town would be buying them . Soon they would be selling like whisky and pills . . " You.will find that it is more effective than the telephone , less clumsy than the automobile and much cheaper to operate than the B-52 , the B-52 , the B-52 , the ** the salesman said and said and said . The punch on the back did n't work this time . He , became silent and a shoulder fell off and struck the floor with a clang . He needed servicing badly , but all the shops were filled for weeks , and , anyway , it would be cheaper for whoever operated him to scrap him and buy a new one . At least , that 's what they always say . In short , he went in the trash . ' The box is still here on the desk . N might be interesting just to see if it really works . Let 's see now , who could be disintegrated without much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yo-4. understand . . we wo n't have to see the'aCtual vanishing . . . ,
