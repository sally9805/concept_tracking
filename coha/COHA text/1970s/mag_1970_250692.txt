With his wayward orange mane and glazed fish-green eyes . Gene Wilder conveys a beguiling look of incipient madness . In his films to date he has seemed always on the verge of lurching into some marvelously insane enterprise . For a time he worried about becoming typecast as Hollywood 's favorite neurasthenic comedian . " There was always a reservoir of hysteria in me that I could call upon as an actor , " says Wilder . " As I grew out of it , I became more and more dissatisfied with the parts I was playing . But Hollywood , of course , could n't keep up with my psychological advancement . So I played hysterical accountants The Producers , nervous undertakers Bonnie and Clyde , and mad aristocrats Start the Revolution Without Me . " <P> Hollywood has caught up at last . Wilder , 35 , has lately been besieged with scripts and has sifted through them with his own brand of mad logic . What sort of actor would turn down a tempting offer from Mike Nichols to play in Catch-22 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a film improbably titled Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in The Bronx ? To everyone 's good fortune ( especially his own ) , Wilder did just that . Says he : " Quackser was the idealization of everything I 've wanted to do as an actor . He typifies where I 'm at now-humorous , sexual , innocent and striving for simplicity . " Wilder 's delicate blend of humor and pathos makes the viewer think he is seeing young Charlie Chaplin with reddish hair and an Irish brogue . It also makes Quackser Fortune one of the most delightful comic dramas in recent years . <P> <P> Quackser is an urban savage who prefers shoveling horse manure from the streets of Dublin and spreading it on ladies ' flowers to working in the foundry with his father . Without Wilder 's protean talents , the film could have been absurd : an upper-middle-class American girl studying at Trinity College ( Margot Kidder ) nearly runs Quackser over in an MG but winds up taking him to her farewell dance and ultimately to bed . Wilder makes the affair believable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as sexual overtones ; he himself added two scenes early in the film in which Quackser stays his daily rounds long enough to dally with a lusty Gaelic wench . The romance is only part of the film ; the rest concerns Quackser 's slow , painful acceptance of the inexorability of civilization . He is forced to a showdown with himself when the last milkwagon horses are cleared from the streets , and his eventual compromise is both whimsical and affecting .
