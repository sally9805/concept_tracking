In their relentless pursuit of a trim figure , American women by the millions have tried exercise wheels , home massage kits , sauna belts , sauna pants and mummy wraps . Now they are turning to something new : the Isotoner Body Beauty Suit , which seems to have a slender edge over the other devices . It requires no effort except for putting it on , and it slims the body , even if no pounds are shed . <P> Before pulling on the two-piece , leotard-like , nylon spandex suit , customers are advised to cover their bodies with a light film of greaseless Isotoner Motion Cream . Any movement , explains Aris Gloves , the manufacturer , then causes the suit and cream to work " synergistically . " The suit will knead the cream into the body and the fiber will produce an " isometric push-pull action " that makes the whole operation a kind of wear-a-massage . <P> Isotoner advertising carefully skirts the issue of weight reduction , claiming only to make wearers look and feel thinner . The nylon spandex suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one wearer told San Francisco 's I. Magnin &; Co. , " better than a lover 's caress . " <P> Isotoners come in several colors , have scoop or mock-turtle necks and are meant to be worn like any body suit . Prices : $45 for the turtle neck , $35 for the scoop , $35 for the bottoms . Four-ounce refills of the cream are $8.50 . The company recently introduced two-piece body suits for men , and this spring will place on sale a " safari " model with short sleeves , club collar and front pockets . Designer Cardinali has sketched " couture " print evening body suits for fall , and Geoffrey Beene already has a collection of separates designed to go with the Isotoner . <P> One word of caution . Isotoner suits should be worn with a bra , Aris ' Barbara Kling concedes , and for good reason : " Without a bra for women with a large bosom , Isotoner will flatten the bust . For women with small breasts , it will flatten the area completely . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
