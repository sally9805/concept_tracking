Trumpets blared . Fireworks exploded . Drums and cannons thundered . A 700-voice chorus sang hallelujah . A band played The Ballad of Rainbow and Snow . Eight hundred Japanese children on ice skates released 18,000 multicolored balloons into the air . More than 1,000 athletes from 35 countries paraded in their winter finery . And right in the middle of it all was the old ringmaster himself , Avery Brundage , president of the International Olympic Committee ( I.O.C. ) . In calling upon Emperor Hirohito officially to open the 1972 Winter Games in Sapporo , Japan , last week , Brundage said : " May the Olympic code of fair play and good sportsmanship prevail . " At least one observer was unimpressed by Brundage 's sentiment . Snapped Austrian Skier Karl Schranz : " That 's ridiculous , coming from him . " <P> Schranz , who watched the ceremonies on TV in a Sapporo hotel room , had good reason to be bitter . When Olympic history is written , he will be remembered as the man who was caught in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ski ( F.I.S. ) . The issue was clear-cut . For years F.I.S. skiers have been paid-either openly or under the table-for endorsing equipment . And for years Brundage has been threatening to bar the " trained seals of the merchandisers " from Olympic competition for violating the rule against professionalism . The F.I.S. hoped to call Brundage 's bluff at Sapporo . The Austrian and French ski teams announced that they would withdraw from the games if " even one " of their members was disqualified . The flinty Brundage , now 84 and due to retire after the Summer Games in Munich , was determined not to fold . Rather than make a sham of the games by ousting 30 to 40 of the world 's top skiers , he and the I.O.C. settled on one scapegoat . Just three days before the opening of the Sapporo games , and by a compromise vote of 28 to 14 , the committee agreed to disqualify Schranz , a veteran ski idol and a favorite in the men 's downhill . <P> Unmoved . " It 's absurd ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being sacrificed in a highly unethical manner . " Sneered Vienna 's Kronen Zeitung : " Amateurs of Brundage 's Olympic imagination exist only in the childhood dreams of this bad old man . " The old man was unmoved . Said Klee : " Under the circumstances , there is only one road open to us-the road home . " After a night of consultations , however , the Austrians decided to compete , ostensibly at the urging of Schranz . <P> Far from contrite , Schranz pointed out that " the Russians are subsidized by their government , and all international athletes get help from one source or another . " While Brundage ignores the open professionalism of Russian and other competitors from Iron Curtain countries because he says he lacks " documentation , " his case against Schranz was provoked in part by the skier 's criticism of the I.O.C. for its " 19th century attitudes " and for " favoring rich competitors over poor ones . " Brundage in turn characterized Schranz as a " blatant and verbose offender " who is " disrespectful to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
