Broadway has attempted the impossible so far this season-theater without plays . In this drama vacuum , we have been offered illustrated record albums , scissors-and-paste adaptations of short stories and documentary racial preachments . <P> Like a bridge player with an unbiddable hand , drama passes again in Unlikely Heroes : 3 Philip Roth Stories . <P> Right off , the title is a giveaway . Can anyone imagine that the writer 's name would have marquee pulling power , except for Portnoy 's Complaint ? Under the circumstances , it might have been cleverer to adapt the novel . After all , simulated masturbation poses no problem for the contemporary stage . However , it is almost a conditioned commercial reflex to exhume the early and lesser work of gifted men . <P> Universal Malady . The three short stories involved here , Defender of the Faith , Epstein and Eli , the Fanatic , have been faithfully adapted by Larry Arrick from the original late ' 50s texts . Indeed , he might have been better advised to put the evening together as a reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression that one has wandered into a library rather than a theater . <P> Defender of the Faith concerns a World War II trainee ( Jon Korkes ) who practices a kind of coreligionist blackmail on his sergeant ( David Ackroyd ) to secure special privileges for the camp 's Jewish contingent . Between the laughs and the plot twists lurks the question of where ethnic solidarity begins and ends . Epstein , the funniest of the tales , focuses on that universal malady , middle age . Epstein 's morale has drooped in exact ratio to the sag of his wife Goldie 's breasts . In the title role , Lou Jacobi , who looks rather like a Levantine Walter Cronkite , is hilarious , wistful , bewildered and altogether human . Epstein has an affair with a sprightly widow . But , under Jehovah 's unblinking eye , there is no sin without atonement . <P> Unitarian Solution . The last story , Eli , the Fanatic , borders on mysticism . Its chief characters are a lawyer in a Brooks Brothers suit ( Michael Tolan ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talmudic scholar ( Lou Jacob ! ) and the scholar 's helper ( David Ackroyd ) . The assistant is a bearded D.P. who survived a concentration camp with only the ghetto garb of a black suit , small prayer shawl and broad-brimmed hat . <P> This outfit and the scholar 's yeshiva students outrage a Jewish suburban group that looks on Unitarianism as rather a nice solution to any questions of Jewishness . The lawyer is appointed to rid the community of these symbols of religious exclusivity and suffering . But the lawyer undergoes a transformation of identity and winds up wearing the D.P. 's clothing , and beating his breast in ritual anguish . Michael Tolan undergoes this probe of the tribal subconscious with moving sensitivity . <P> The personal sense of anxiety about being faithful to one 's Jewishness gives the evening a curiously dated air . The freedom to be as greatly or as minimally Jewish as one wishes seems to be taken for granted nowadays . What was once a matter of conscience has become largely a question of will and desire .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
