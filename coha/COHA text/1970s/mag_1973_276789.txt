The death watch in Cambodia has begun . With signs of its vitality fast fading , the Phnom-Penh regime last week resembled a terminal patient approaching the end . As many as 12,000 Khmer insurgent troops had massed within a 20-mile radius of the capital . Some crept so close that they were within two-mile mortar range , from where they shelled the city , killing 20 civilians and wounding 75 . TIME Correspondent Barry Hillenbrand was in Phnom-Penh to measure the life expectancy of the regime . His report : <P> The situation in Cambodia is so grave that it is hard to find an optimistic military assessment around Phnom-Penh . The army of President Lon Nol is not performing well . Even with the intense U.S. bombing , the insurgents merely take their losses and keep on coming . A well-informed Western intelligence officer observes that " while the government 's forces have been going downhill , the insurgents have been improving . " Even usually optimistic Premier In Tam candidly allowed that the military situation was going " from bad to worse . " Villagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to Phnom-Penh are crowded with refugees , their pots , mattresses , bedframes and children piled high on ox-drawn carts . <P> The insurgents are only two miles from Takhmau , a suburb of Phnom-Penh so critical to the capital 's defenses that one Western diplomat vows that " if the insurgents take Takhmau . I 'm heading for the airport . " One might expect that the approach to Takhmau would be studded with government gun emplacements and fallback defensive positions . Not so . It is poorly defended . To the soldiers along Route 2 , which cuts through Takhmau to Phnom-Penh , the situation looks bleak . They feel that the government has done little for them . They complain about the corruption of the Lon Nol regime . One soldier , a deep orange flower stuck in the band of his helmet , asks as he takes time out from battle to fix some rice for a meager lunch : " Where are all the medicines ? We do n't see them out here . They are on the black market in Phnom-Penh . " Worrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he admits that " It 's going to be difficult to fight without it . " <P> The situation appears so hopeless that the Australian embassy has evacuated all dependents and has sent hand-delivered letters to all its other nationals living in Phnom-Penh , firmly suggesting that unless urgent business keeps them there , they had better leave as soon as possible . The British have done the same . The incessant bombing by American planes is now so close that the explosions not only rattle the windows of Phnom-Penh 's buildings but also shake some interior walls . On the broad park lawns of the capital , military instructors attempt to train new troops .
