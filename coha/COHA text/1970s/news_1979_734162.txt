txt TILE WORLD 'S biggest BB gun recoils and spits forth a 500-pound chunk of concrete at the speed of a ictliner . Eighty feet away , the hurtling mass slams into a reinforced wall  --  a wall exactly like the ones that protect nuclear reactor plants . The wall withstands the impact , and the assault fails . But failure is success for nuclear safety and for the scientists of the Illinois Institute of Technology iIITI who trigger the big gun at a remote testing ground near La Porte , lad . " The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has strict requirements for constructing nuclear plants . One requirement is that walls be capable of withstanding tornado-borne debris , " said Hyla Napadensky , head of fire and safety research at the IIT Research Institute . WITII THE increasing awareness and concern over nuclear accidents , the federal government wants to make sure the nuclear plants are safe , Napadensky said . To test what would happen if a tornado gust hurled a telephone pole at a plant wall , research institute scientists stuffed a 35-foot pole into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a tree , and God made trees tapered  --  engineers made the gun barrel straight . So we ran into problems , " said Milt Nusbaum , senior research engineer at the institute . To rectify the problem , the researchers inserted dowels into the pole to straighten it . But when the gun was fired , the pole landed short and the front crumbled into a mass of splinters and sawdust , Nusbaum said , " FINALLY . WE had to test quarterscale . We used a pole a quarter shorter and a wall a quarter as thick . We also tired pipes and two-by-fours , anything that might be at a construction site . Basically , we found that a tornado is n't much of a threat to a nuclear plant , " Nusbaum said . But sometimes scientists do n't have all tile answers . When asked to explain the frequently photographed post-tornado phenomenon of a straw that has penetrated through a steel beam , Nusbaum was at a loss . " Tye never understood that either , " the senior researcher confessed . Besides testing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy slabs of concrete at munition // Huge BB-gun tests safety of atom plant // shells to test their impact tolerance . " IN AWRY munitions plants , explo sive shells are stored in different rooms . We want to determine if an explosion in one room will cause the flying concrete blocks from the wall to explode other shells and start a chain reaction , " Napadensky said . Built in 1071 at a cost of $30,000 , the specially constructed gun would now cost nearly $250,000 . While the tests can be expensive I from $200 to $10,000 eachJ , the results can save millions  --  and lives . " A company wo n't have to build a two-foot wall if an eight-inch wall is sufficient . One nuclear plant saved $10 million . You have to do a lot of planning first . The tests may take a microsecond , but there may be weeks or months of preparation , " she said .

The gun is located near La Porte , she said , but she was reluctant to reveal the exact location . " It 's a rural and remote spot , almost impossible to get to . So far , we 've had no problem with vandalism . It 's a combination of modern technology and all old-fashioned watch dog . " At the center 's fire laboratory in Gary , IIT researchers do more testing Jack Mabley Column 1 for private companies , including whether pipelines can explode after being struck by vandals ' rifle fire . RESEARCHERS SET fires to test smoke detectors and detector placement and study the effect fire has on certain materials . The laboratory is equipped with movable walls so researchers can simulate different warehouse and room dimensions . In addition , the researchers use homes slated for demolition to test such possibilities as how quickly a fire would spread through a house after it was touched off by the heat of a nuclear blast followed by shockwaves . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract for the General Services Administration ( GSA tested the alarm time of duct-installed smoke detectors versus ceiling sprinkler systems . " WE SET up two typical vental configurations for GSA offices , The first was a setup in an older office with a more confined office space . In this , the air circulates out into a hallway before entering the ducts . In the second , a larger , more modern office , the air circulates through a ceiling duct , " said researcher Kim Mniszewski . To balance the test , a commercial smoke alarm sold in stores was installed in each office . " We were testing the duct detectors and the sprinklers ' reaction times and found little difference between the two . But WO did find that the commercial smoke detectors reacted faster than either one , " illniszewski said . The researchers conduct all kinds of rests to better man 's chances against the predictable , but sometimes all the tests in the world ca n't prevent disaster .
