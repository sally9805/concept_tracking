txt CAPE BIRD , Antarctica  --  The largest animal living an the Antarctic continent is a tiny wingless fly . It probably does n't need wings because if it were to fly en inch or two off the ground , it would freeze to death . So put away your lion-hunting gun and pull out your microscope if you plan to make a safari to the meanest land in the world . The environment is so hostile here that practically nothing grows larger than microscopic size . A few hardy lichens , mosses , yeast. bacteria , and algae call it home . MUCH OF THE high polar plateau is so sterile , in fact , that the instruments sent to Mars to search for life would fail to detect any living thing at the South Pole . The continent is basically unhabitable because it is so cold and dry . Except for a few living things that make up a miniature world , nothing much larger than a a thumb tack can survive . The coasts , however , are another matter . There you can find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TILE BIG DIFFERENCE Is that these animals live off the seas , not the land . The land and the seas are a study in contrasts . Whereas the continent is barren , the surrounding oceans may have the richest marine life anywhere in the world . The water Is cold and dense and therefore holds a lot of oxygen . It also is rich in nutrients that are percolated constantly by the action of cold water sinking and warm water rising . Phytoplankton , the single-celled plants that start the chain of sea life , thrive here in abundance . GIANTS LIVE in these seas . The blue whale , the biggest animal that has ever existed on Earth , lives here . Its size exceeds that of the largest prehistoric dinosaur . An adult may grow to 90 feet long and weigh 150 tons . The harsh climate has led to some strange evolutionary adaptations . The Weddell seal , for Instance , is the best diver in the world and lives comfortably on the ice all its life . The wingless fly lives in areas free of snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun heats the ground , creating a liveable environment about an Inch high where the fly can survive on moisture and microorganisms . ONE OF THE most unusual forms Of life is a microcosmic population inhabiting the perpetually frozen Bonne Lake in Taylor Valley , part of the mysterious Dry Valleys where there Is no snow . The population consists of bacteria and algae that have learned to live together in order to survive , said Dr. Bruce L. Parker of the Virginia Poly // Column 1 Antarctica is no kingdom for animals // technic Institute , who Is living in a nearby hut . It is a beautiful example of cooperation that allows each species of cell to survive in a hostile environment where neither could live alone , he said . THE BACTERIA and algae form a colony that looks like a spongy glob . During the Antarctic winter , when the sun does n't shine , the colony lies dormant underneath the lake ice . With the first ray of sunlight , the algae wake up and begin the process of photosynthesis , converting the sun 's energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria . There is nothing for them to eat except the algae , but if they ate all the algae their precarious food supply would run out , and the bacteria would perish . So they wait until some of the algae die to dine on their protein-rich remains . To pay for their dinner , the bacteria make carbon dioxide , a by-product of metabolism . The gas is an essential nutrient for the algae , and they quickly gobble it up . LIFE IS much more normal for the fish because they make their own antifreeze . In fact , one species , the Antarctic cod , weighs up to 160 pounds and is so plentiful that it may be a valuable new resource for commercial fishermen . These winterized denizens of the coldest place on Earth are being studied by Dr. Arthur DeVries , an assistant professor of physiology at the University of Illinois in Urbana . DEVBIES , who has caught more than 1,200 of the big cod through a hole in the Ice on Sound , discovered that the antifreeze Is glycoprotein , a molecube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from growing . Other scientists now are using the molecule to see whether better ways can be developed for preserving such things as frozen blood and milk . They also are using it in cancer studies because it acts as a cell marker . MEDICAL benefits also may came out of the study of the Weddell seals , These animals are the world 's champion divers . They can dive to depths of 1,650 feet and stay under water for as long as 1% hours . By studying their amazing diving ability researchers hope to develop new methods for treating shock , respiratory , problems , and crib death in man , Two anesthesiologists , Dr. Mike Snider of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and Dr. Jasper Qvist of Herlev Hospital in Copenhagen , have uncovered some of the seal 's secrets in their laboratory . WHEN a seal 's diving response is triggered , it shuts off all blood flow except to the heart and the brain . The heart , which normally pumps 40 quarts of blood a minute , slows to a trickle of only four quarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Snider . Learning how the seal can live without blood to most of its body may shed new light on how to help people survive shock , he said . Such information also may help people with respiratory problems who have an uneven distribution of blood . Man has a reaction similar to the seal 's when he 's immersed in cold water . The reflex may play a role in the sudden stoppage of breathing in the mysterious crib deaths , said Snider . TILE BONE-CHILLING job of studying the sea floor life around belongs to John Oliver of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla , Cal. , and Pete Slattery , of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratory in Monterey , Cal . Donning rubberized dry suits , they dive 100 feet underneath the ice to examine the teeming life of invertebrates such as sponges , worms , and starfish that inhabit the bottom . The heavy plankton blooms , stimulated by months of continuous sunshine , give the bottom life a fabulous feast , said Oliver . Bottom-dwelling animals are more abundant here than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very cold water , life processes are slowed down and things seem to live longer , said Slattery . Preliminary studies show that shrimp live longer and that sponges live hundreds of years , he added . Not wanting to upset the delicate balance of life , many nations interested in Antarctica have agreed not to introduce any foreign species here . The only exception is New Zealand , which for nostalgic reasons , is allowed to maintain sled dogs ,
