txt IT USED TO be that when anybody was mugged , shot , raped , or stabbed in Hyde Park , the crime drew an inordinate amount of attention . But now everybody knows that strong-arm artists , sex creeps , and amateur burglars are everywhere , including in the lakeshore communities on the North Side , where people used to feel safe . If you do n't believe it , consider all of the closed-circuit TV eyes , private still rate crime as their number one problem . Listen , for example , to Mrs. Linda Brakel , mother of two and the wife of Samuel , an American Bar Foundation staff member : " IT WAS A Sunday afternoon , and the four of us were visiting the Museum of Science and Industry . I remember it was crowded and we were at the hardwood exhibit when these three teen-age boys began molesting some girls , verbally and physically . When my husband tried to stop them , they pulled out knives . Then my husband picked up a chair from the exhibit and smashed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all ran away . " And that is n't all . There was a murder in a parking lot near where we live and a purse-snatching right in front of our place . We bought bikes , but I never use mine because the kids throw rocks at you . Taking walks at night is out of the question . " Mrs. Brakel quickly added that she and her family have " loved " Hyde Park 's amenities and made many friends there . M 0 S T VETERAN Hyde Park residents , like their counterparts in other neighborhoods , accept the threat of crime as an unpleasant fact of life , take-precautions , hope things will get better . " I 've probably made myself a pain in the neck to my family because I 'm so security-i conscious , " said a University of Chicago administrator who requested anonymity . " We 're careful about keeping doors locked . We do n't make ourselves sitting ducks . We  --  have a big dog . I know we have problems in this neighborhood , but where else can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of going thru the hassle of commuting ! " ' WE 'VE DISCUSSED moving out , but where would we go ? " said Mrs. Lia Green , managing editor of an academic journal . Mrs. Green , her husband and their three children have lived in Hyde Park for 10 years . The thought . of moving to the suburbs chills them . Many old specialty shops and other businesses that once gave the neighborhood a touch of elegance are gone , largely because of urban renewal , said Mrs. Green . " We only have one movie house , " she said . " You ca n't even find a place to buy a cup of coffee or a pack of cigarets after 10 at night , and I ca n't go out alone at night because I 'm afraid I 'll get mugged . Burglars hit our home a couple of years ago . But maybe this is just the price you pay for living in the city . " The integrated Kenwood High School " has helped keep us here , " said Mrs. Green , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a super experience for him . " HYDE PARKERS endlessly debate their school problems . Some feel the university 's fam o u s Laboratory Schools which children of faculty may attend at half-tuition ) are essential to the community 's preservation . They say many residents would move out were it not for the kindergartenthru-high school facility . Others believe that if there were no university schools , the bright youngsters who now attend them would upgrade the learning climate of public schools in the neighborhood . The casual acceptance of integration by blacks and whites who live in Hyde Park collides with white fear of that small percentage of blacks whom they perceive as threatening . This sets up a delicate balance of emotions and results in feelings of guilt on the part of some whites who move out . Whites also have ambivalent feelings about police protection in the neighborhood . They demand extra-attentive policing , particularly after a major crime has been committed ? and they get It , in part because of the university 's clout . AT THE same time , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they define as harassment of blacks . Some middle-class blacks on the other hand , quietly wish for tougher policing to rid the community of street people who c r ea t e trouble and unease . " Do n't use my name , " said one such black , " But what I 'd like to see is the police getting out of their cars and poundinv , beats and getting the winos out of this neighborhood . I 'm telling you this even tho it just happens that most of those winos are black , like me . " " I 've observed hostility that 's increasing , dreadful , and disturbing , " said Ald. Leon Desures 5thl , who has lived in Hyde Park since he was 3 years old . " I ride a bike , and I used to go anywhere on it , but now I 'm very careful about where I go . The hostility I see is among black adolescents , and I view it as grave and as growing thruout Chicago and the rest of the country . " ISAIAH Henderson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago , shifted the subject of race into a different perspective . " Why does integration work here ? Most people I run into here are people of aspiration and education , and that 's natural in a place in the environs of the university . We 're all snobs here , in one sense . " You know , we ca n't afford to lose too many whites from Hyde Park . We do n't want it all black . If we lose all the white families , we weaken the tax base and the schools , and we ca n't afford to let that happen . " Integration ? In Hyde Park , we 're not Negroes at all . We 're just people .
