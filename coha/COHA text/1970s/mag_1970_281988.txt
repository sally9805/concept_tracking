Never before had the myth of German cleanliness been questioned so rudely , and the Bundesrepublik erupted in indignant protest . In a full-page advertisement in West Germany 's weekly magazine Der Spiegel , a family of three was shown in impeccable dress-but all with pigs ' faces . Beneath them were the words : " This year , in the average German family , the child will wear his underwear four days , the wife five days and the husband seven days . " The ad was placed by the obviously phony " Action Committee for Fresh Underwear , " presumably an invention of German soft-goods manufacturers . <P> Sober periodicals such as the intellectual weekly Die Zeit questioned the ad 's statistics , and the business journal Handelsblatt attacked it as " a model of tastelessness . " Popular reaction was less restrained . Der Spiegel was deluged by bitter letters of complaint . <P> Less emotional observers , however , wondered whether the very scale of the response indicated that the accusation had hit home . A poll taken by the Allensbach Institute showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The average German housewife spends perhaps four hours daily scrubbing and polishing her home , and 75% of car owners feel obliged to wash and polish their autos every Saturday afternoon . <P> This obsessive cleanliness , however , applies chiefly to things the neighbors may see-and not to more personal areas . According to statistics gathered by two highly reliable market-research institutes , the average German changes his shirt every other day , his socks and underwear every three to four days , and his bed linen every four weeks . More than half of West Germany 's citizens brush their teeth only rarely , and the same proportion bathe only once a week ; for roughly 10% of the population , the figure is once every four weeks . <P> The cleanliness issue has cropped up across the border , too . East Germany 's Volksarmee , honoring Lenin 's 100th birthday , recently launched " Operation Clean Underpants " with an ambitious goal : to get 80% of the troopers to change their shorts once a week . The results have been scanty . Many soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new arrivals , unworn , to the Army laundry . Meanwhile they continued to wear , for periods of up to several weeks , the older , more lived-in garments to which they had become so attached .
