" I have a vast plan in my pocket , " boasted Lieut . General Juan Carlos On-gania to his countrymen four years ago after an army coup had installed him as President of Argentina . It became increasingly clear that Ongania 's chief aim was to perpetuate his own authoritarian rule . To do so , he sought to create a corporate state in the style of Italy 's Mussolini or Spain 's Franco . Instead of holding elections , Ongania planned to establish a " three-pillared state " by appointing representatives of the unions , business interests and the technical-professional class to new executive advisory councils . <P> In pursuit of this goal , Ongania began to solicit the support of the labor unions , many of which are still dominated by the totalitarian principles of the long-deposed Juan Peron . Ongania 's appeal to the unions and entrepreneurs angered the army generals , who consider themselves the guardians of Argentina 's welfare . At a meeting last month the generals barraged the President with complaints about his dictatorial designs . When one young general complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But we are having a dialogue now . " " We are not , " snapped the general . " You are lecturing us , and besides I doubt if the people would consider us their just representatives . " The generals sought to persuade Ongania to set a date for the election of a representative civilian government , but Ongania refused . Last week , in Argentina 's sixth military coup in 40 years , the army surrounded Buenos Aires ' Government House with troops . After holding out for twelve hours , the stubborn Ongania stepped into a Mercedes and drove 21 blocks to the junta 's headquarters . " Gentlemen , I have come to present my resignation , " he announced . <P> <P> Ongania was unpopular with civilians and military alike for his stubborn authoritarianism . His generals called him " El Cano " ( The Pipe ) , because , as one officer explained it , " He is very straight , but also very hollow . " He did manage to curb Argentina 's dangerous inflation , which dropped from 26.7% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of foreign businessmen by allowing repatriation of profits and by inviting the return of foreign oil companies whose exploration contracts had been canceled by his civilian predecessor , President Arturo Umberto Illia.
