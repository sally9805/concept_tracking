" The American farmer today is land happy and iron crazy . He buys bigger equipment because he figures he is going to own more land ; then he has to buy land to justify the expense . Then the farmer realizes he is not making much of a living considering his capital investment , and he quits . " <P> This sharp dissent to the " get big or get out " philosophy comes from , of all people , David Garst , 52 , the ruler of a family agribusiness empire big enough to make him a prairie Rockefeller . Based in Coon Rapids , Iowa , the business includes 8,000 acres on which the Garsts raise seed corn and breeding cattle , as well as a grain-elevator and storage operation , machinery manufacturing , the preparation and sale of agricultural chemicals , five banks and an insurance company . The Garst assets , which are divided among David , one brother , three sisters and their children , probably total more than $50 million . But as a supplier to farmers , Garst sees agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the key to farming efficiency is not size but careful management and enlistment in a technological revolution of which Garst is a leader . <P> Being out front with ideas is a Garst family tradition . David 's father Roswell , who died last November at 79 , is remembered internationally as the corn grower who played host to Nikita Khrushchev on his U.S. tour in 1959 . But on the prairies Roswell is remembered as a developer , with Henry Wallace , of hybrid corn . David , a blunt-featured bear of a man who graduated from Stanford ( ' 50 ) , is promoting innovation on his own . Among the techniques that he and his family have pushed : <P> &gt; No plowing . For millennia , farmers have turned over the land with plows before tilling it , cultivating it and putting in seed . Now , machines are available that combine several operations in a process called minimum tillage . One machine , on which Garst and a partner hold the patent , cuts a V-shaped furrow in unplowed land and simultaneously drops in seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone back to the pointed stick . " <P> &gt; No rotation . Insecticides and herbicides have done away with the need to rotate crops in order to keep pests from infesting the soil . No longer must a farmer periodically allow his best land to lie fallow , or plant it with unprofitable crops . <P> &gt;No waste . The Garsts have promoted the idea of feeding cattle corn cobs , stalks and leaves that traditionally were thrown away ; when this " stover " is mixed with other nutrients , the beasts love it . If this method became universal , Garst estimates , the U.S. could fatten 50% more cattle than the 110 million or so now in the national herd . <P> Garst believes that " it is in livestock that we will see the great revolution of the next 20 years . We will be producing more meat less expensively , and we will have the opportunity for much more export . " He is crossing U.S. breeds with European stock to produce " exotic " cattle that grow fatter faster or produce more milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We have one of the largest accumulations of exotic semen from Europe .
