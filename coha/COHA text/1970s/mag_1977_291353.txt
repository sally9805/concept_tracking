Since Charles II appointed John Dryden England 's first Poet Laureate in 1668 , the office has been occupied by a number of distinguished men , including Wordsworth , Tennyson , John Masefield and C. Day Lewis . But the job is no plum . As an officer of the royal household , a Poet Laureate ranks just above Bargemaster and Keeper of the Swans . By today 's devaluated standards , his pay is $122.50 a year , plus $47.25 in lieu of a butt of sack-once part of the traditional stipend . <P> Last week Britain 's literate and near-literate were howling to give the present P.L. , Sir John Betjeman , the sack . The reason was the verse he had written on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth 's reign . It was as if the mother tongue of Shakespeare and Milton had lapsed into baby talk . Betjeman 's quatrains palpitated with cliches and such treacly rhymes as people/steeple , dutiful/beautiful and blue/true . Stanza 4 particularly captured the poem 's schoolboy earnestness : <P> <P> Hers the grace the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is here . <P> Let the bells do what they 're made <P> for ! <P> Ring out Thanks both loud and <P> clear <P> " It 's a nice Valentine's-card poem , " said Poet Laurie Lee . Other critics less charitably called Betjeman 's work " absolutely pathetic " and " nursery-rhyme gibberish . " Member of Parliament Nicholas Fairbairn vowed to write a superior poem ( he could not ) , and the Sunday People invited schoolchildren to submit their efforts with the appeal , " Can YOU do better than Sir John ? " <P> At 70 , Betjeman is one of Britain 's bestselling poets . His light verse frequently reflects the loss of 19th century pastoral England . Last week he defended his 24-line Jubilee Hymn on grounds that it was meant to be sung , not recited . Indeed , it had been set to melody by Malcolm Williamson , Master of the Queen 's Music , and drew loud applause when performed by the Trinity Boys ' Choir at London 's Royal Albert Hall . <P> England 's 17th Poet Laureate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betjeman is not really to blame . The problem is having to get emotional about the monarchy at all . " History seems to support Grigson 's point . Most Laureates have found the muse reluctant to lower herself for mere royalty . At the birth of Prince Andrew in 1960 , C. Day Lewis , Betjeman 's predecessor , had to make do with " You princely babe , you pretty dear/ For you we bring/ The birthday honors of the quickening year . " He could have done worse . When the future Edward VII lay ill at the turn of the century , Laureate Alfred Austin wrote : " Along the wires the electric message came/ He is no better , he is much the same .
