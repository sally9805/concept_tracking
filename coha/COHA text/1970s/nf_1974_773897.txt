txt WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? breathing smog ; they 're not subject to the environmental stresses humans are . They live in an air-conditioned , constant-temperature controlled environment called Utopia . This is obviously not the case with the human population , where you have the weak and the puny , the sick and the undernourished , the elderly and the stressridden , all eating foods and breathing air loaded with other chemicals . All of these variables can influence chemical effects ; studies show that animals as well as humans subjected to stress , temperature changes and nutrient deficiencies are more susceptible to chemical assaults . The same has been found in humans with respect to cancer . Why do some smokers get cancer while others do not ? When asked how animal studies apply to man , Dr. John H. Weisburger of the National Cancer Institute replies , " Which man ? You or me ? " ? so great is individual variance in susceptibility . Dr. Saffiotti has stated : " It has been found that . .. changes in age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic factors , individual variations in the metabolic handling of chemicals , or the combined effects of different chemicals all can alter the response of an individual to a chemical carcinogen ; differences in response as high as ioo-fold or i , 000-fold can be obtained by changing only one factor at a time . " ' 0 Obviously , test animals must be homogeneous ? though they too have individual susceptibilities ? and must be free from extraneous influences , so that we can be sure the tested chemical is indeed the factor causing the harm . But , precisely because we use only the elite and pampered of a species , it is a rare event when their resistance is overcome by a chemical . Third , because of the small number of animals used in testing , it is far easier to miss a harmful chemical than to spot it . Imagine the problem of housing and the cost of using aoo million animals for a single experiment , though theoretically this would provide the most reliable results possible ? on a one-to-one animal ? people basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6o FAST POISON , SLOW POISON hundred rats or mice ; and if monkeys or other primates are used the figure is much lower ? perhaps seven to ten or so because of the expense . Now , these small numbers of animals , let 's say fifty mice for example , are supposed to represent the total population of over 20o million Americans ? each mouse standing for four million persons . Considering the vast differences in individual susceptibility of humans , it is impossible that one mouse could contain all the vagaries in his body that might plague some four million diverse persons in the country . To try to compensate for the small numbers and the short life span of mice , scientists give doses a hundred or even a thousand times higher than those given to humans . These massive doses are often ridiculed by the food industry and inexcusably by FDA officials themselves as irrelevant to humans . When cyclamate was banned , some persons contended you would have to drink bathtubs of soft drinks every day to ingest cyclamate comparable to the great amounts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense . The well-accepted toxicological theory is that to compensate for the small numbers of animals used in experiments , massive doses are necessary to elicit all of the possible adverse effects that might occur throughout the animal 's lifetime . But even using massive doses in small numbers of animals , it is easy to miss chemically induced damage that could have enormous consequences to the population . Suppose a chemical is a carcinogen of such potency that it is inciting cancer in one percent of the population . Since one percent of fifty experimental rats is half a rat , such cancer would be totally overlooked in an ordinary animal experiment ? and yet on the human scale the results could be disastrous . One percent of our population is two million persons ! The situation becomes more precarious when you 're trying to spot harmful chemicals that may affect only fractions of percentages of animals and people . A chemical that provoked high blood pressure or liver damage in only one twentieth of one percent of the population would be virtually impossible to detect through 61 WHAT 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , 400,000 persons in this country would be adversely affected . The same is true with weak carcinogens . Dr. Saffiotti says that if you pick up a carcinogen from present animal testing you can be sure it is a strong one ; the weak ones just do n't show up . Working under such limited circumstances it then is pure chance when we spot a chemical that is not superextreme in its harmful potency . Because of the nature of cancer-causing agents , no " safe " level can be set for them . But with chemicals displaying ordinary chronic toxicity , toxicologists try to interpret " safe " dosages for humans ? tolerances ? based on the amount of chemical it took to harm the animals . Theoretically , in valid experiments the more of a chemical you give , the greater the harm . Ten micrograms of a chemical is supposed to produce roughly ten times as much harm as one microgram . That is why in an experiment you administer several dosage levels , graduated down the scale , to a group of chosen animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to the point where no statistically significant damage shows up . ( Controls ? untreated animals ? which are included in every experiment , may develop tumors and other diseases as they age , and these have to be considered and appraised statistically to determine any difference . ) The point at which no damage occurs is called the " no effect " level or " safe dosage " for animals . To set tolerances , toxicologists , however do not apply the " safe " animal dosage directly to humans . If a rat weighing one pound could tolerate one ounce per day of chemical without exhibiting harm , it does not mean that a 12o-pound woman could safely eat no ounces , or about seven and a half pounds , of the stuff daily . Here 's where a lot of novices get into trouble ? as well as knowledgeable persons trying to mislead the public . When they simply shift the figures to humans , the matter looks absurd . But it is n't scientifically . Knowing that humans are more sensitive to chemicals than animals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // scientists in extrapolating test results build in a " safety margin . " They multiply the safe animal dose by ten to accommodate the species sensitivity difference ; then they up that figure ten times again to make up for individual susceptibility . This adds up to a hundredfold safety margin , a figure firmly accepted in toxicological circles , though admittedly it is based on the crudest guesswork and has little real scientific basis . In truth , from what we know , the margin could well be greater , considering all the unknowns . No such extrapolation of one hundred , for example , would have helped the women who were two hundred times more sensitive to thalidomide . But as a general rule ? approved by the World Health Organization and written into FDA regulations ? the hundredfold margin is used , usually expressed in parts per million of the chemical per kilogram of body weight . If an animal shows no reaction to a chemical at one hundred parts per million in the diet , it is assumed the chemical is safe for humans at only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred times less . THE WORLD SERIES APPROACH TO SCIENCE We now can see that the more species of animals you test , the greater the chance of picking up hazard . For validity , the tests must be done on at least two species , including males and females . But what if one test shows up positive and the other negative ? Or one test is positive and three are negative ? Or four are positive and two negative ? There are all kinds of ways to juggle scientific results , depending on the species you use ( perhaps a certain strain is extraordinarily resistant to breast tumors ) , the stage at which you give the chemical ( in one positive study of Red 2 food dye the chemical was given from conception , in negative studies the chemical was administered only after the sixth day of pregnancy ) , the time you look for damage ( if you know brain lesions generally show up only after six hours in newborn but you look for them 63 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? sooner , you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , experiments should be able to be duplicated ; ones conducted precisely the same way should show very similar results . It is essential to understand , though , that studies with negative findings do not cancel out the significance of positive studies , though that is the approach of many industry representatives . The FDA comes up with a study showing that mice get thyroid disturbances from eating chemical X , and the industry comes up with one showing that three mice in Kenosha ate the same thing and nothing happened . Then they assert that the first test showing danger is inconclusive or is insufficient basis for making a regulatory decision , or that the studies are " conflicting " or " contradictory " and thus worthless entirely . If more positive data show up , they find more negative data . And so it goes ? " Let 's go for two out of three , four out of seven , five out of nine . " Then there is not even assurance that , arithmetically , numbers will win out . Negative studies sometimes triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychiatry at Washington University Medical School , tells how in the FDA 's eyes four negative studies on MSG ( monosodium glutamate ) " washed out " thirteen positive studies showing a wide range of dangers . MSG is still on the government 's safe list . This World Series approach to science and regulatory decisions is totally unjustified . Considering the crudeness of our testing , a positive result must be taken extremely seriously . FDA scientists consistently state in principle that when in doubt we must rely for maximum safety on the animal most sensitive and assume that man is at least equally sensitive . Thus , any animals that exhibit damage ? under well-conducted experiments ? indicate that something is wrong , negative evidence notwithstanding . Negative studies simply can not be given equal or more equal weight in the presence of contrary positive evidence . Particularly in cancer testing , Dr. Saffiotti points out , weak cancer-causing agents would show up negative because current tests fail to detect cancer inci- // dence below 5 to io percent . " Accordingly , " he stresses , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a positive animal test . " The overriding question is , considering the crudeness of our testing methods , the near-impossibility of discovering harm from human experience , and the frivolous use of many food additives : Why take the risk ? What harm can there be in a conservative approach to protection , as Congress intended ? Government officials often rationalize their laxness by saying that precipitous action against food additives would be rash on the basis of " so little evidence . " Considering everything , it is not caution that is rash but the government 's failure to stringently enforce the law and to protect us against possible future catastrophe . 65 // The logical question as a result of all this is : Why does n't the FDA clean up the food supply ? Why must we be subjected to so many untested or unsafe chemicals in our diet , many of which if taken in pill form could be obtained only by prescription ? The simple answer is that the FDA is not performing its public function . Legally , it has the authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risks drastically , but it does n't . Often the FDA seems more preoccupied with perpetuating the use of food additives than with getting rid of them ? even though they are found unsafe . Some observers of the Washington scene laughingly say " FDA " stands for " foot-dragging artists . " The law is clear . The government does not have to prove additives unsafe . The burden is on industry to prove additives safe . If they ca n't do that , the additives should go out the window . But it does n't work that way , because the prosecutor , judge and jury ? that is , the FDA ? sometimes shifts sides , assumes a defensive posture and lets the industry bulldoze or coax it into taking a stand detrimental to the public interest . The main authority of the FDA over food additives stems from the federal Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 and the Food Additive Amendments of 1958.1 Under the 1938 law , the government had to prove a substance unsafe before it could force its removal from food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by James D. Delaney , Congressman from New 66 York , to bring the preclearance of additives in line with similar preclearance requirements for drugs . Now the law reads that manufacturers must show " proof of a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of an additive . " Thus , the burden of proof for establishing safety was shifted from the government to the users who reaped the economic benefits . Since that time the creators of new additives have had to submit proof of safety , as outlined by the FDA , before the additive could be placed under " a food additive order . " Using an additive without such approval could make a food " adulterated " and subject to government seizure . However , there were loopholes . By the time the 1958 law was passed , there were already a lot of additives in use . Wiley 's optimistic report of 1906 that food manufacturers had abandoned the use of " drugs in food " was short-lived , and additives had proliferated . Also , there were such common " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for centuries , which congressmen felt had to be allowed . So the country was stuck with a whole big group in common use which , after making some perfunctory inquiries around the medical community , FDA officials declared " generally recognized as safe , " or GRAS ( pronounced " grass " ) . These listed items , then ? at the time , 182 ? as allowed by law , were exempt from food additive orders . The GRAS items were not supposed to have detrimental information ( to man or animal ) against them in the medical literature , although , as it was revealed later , few of the medical authorities consulted by FDA even made a search to find out . Some opinions against certain proposed GRAS items were summarily scratched out by FDA officials as " unscientific " or " hearsay " ? for example , one physician 's opinion that cyclamate was unsafe.2 Since few of these additives had ever been tested , the scientific journals were blank about their safety , and what studies had been done were probably locked away ( especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WITH YOUR FOOD ? files or buried somewhere at FDA , unpublished . The fact these items had been used ? sometimes for centuries ? was no reliable indicator of their safety . So , your government 's decision to make an item GRAS was hardly a scientific judgment you would want to stake your life on , and , not surprisingly , many of the GRAS items , when finally rigorously tested , have turned out to be dangerous , such as cyclamate , safrole , saccharin , brominated vegetable oil . And who knows how many others may fail , if and when we ever get around to testing them ? Furthermore , through the years the GRAS list grew as manufacturers came up with more candidates ; sometimes the FDA knew about the items and added them officially to the list , sometimes not . So now nobody knows for sure how many GRAS items are in use , though there is a list of about six hundred published in the Federal Register . James S. Turner noted in The Chemical Feast that the figure is so vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 575 and 68o items on the list . Since the definition of GRAS was not well controlled by FDA , the industry interpreted the law to mean that they alone could decide whether an additive was generally recognized by the scientific community as safe , use it and never feel compelled to notify the FDA of it . Incredibly , the FDA went along with this interpretation . Winton B. Rankin , then Deputy Commissioner of the FDA , said in October 1969 , " The manufacturer is entitled to reach his own conclusions , based on his scientific evidence , that a substance is , in fact , generally recognized as safe . And he is not required to come to us then and get the material added to the list . " Thus , the government let control of the GRAS list slip from its hands into industry 's , and only now , under consumer pressure , is the FDA trying to regain control over it . Another quirky problem is " prior sanctions . " Under the 1958 law , another way industry could get permission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in effect that there was nothing // wrong with an additive they had been using and ask the FDA to send them a letter confirming that it was okay to go ahead using it . Nobody knows how many of these letters through the years went out from FDA , because they were n't filed in any central place and now ca n't be found . But manufacturers , when challenged , keep popping up with letters from FDA ? and according to FDA 's general counsel , Peter B. Hutt , these prior sanctions ca n't be revoked , because they too , like GRAS items , are exempt from food additive orders . In 1970 the FDA announced it was revoking all prior sanction letters , but not the prior sanctions themselves , and what that legally confusing statement means is anybody 's guess . Except the end result is that manufacturers can still legally use additives because once upon a time they received prior-sanction approval from FDA . Nitrite , for example , is a prior-sanction additive , as is SAPP ( sodium acid pyrophosphate ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooked sausages . In March 1972 the U. S. Depart ment of Agriculture petitioned to allow SAPP for such use , and the FDA ruled that the additive would , as other new food addi tives do , require the filing of a food additive petition , showing it had been tested and proved safe for that use . But Griffith Labs , the producers , then informed FDA that they had received a letter of prior sanction in 1962 and had , in fact , been selling SAPP for use in cooked sausages since .1952 , six years prior to the Food Additive Amendments . Thus , SAPP is now in hot dogs as well as other sausages , despite its lack of safety testing . Generally the law gives FDA much discretion in determining what is " safe . " However , an additive is not either always in or always out . GRAS items , however , are considered so safe they are unrestricted and can be used in any amount in any food . For additives under " food additive orders " the FDA can , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts per million in food ) and prescribe specified uses . According to a House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce , reporting out the bill : 69 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? In determining the " safety " of an additive , scientists must take into consideration the cumulative effect of such additive in the diet of man or animals over their respective life spans together with any chemically or pharmacologically related substances in such diet . Thus , the safety of a given additive involves informed judgments based on educated estimates by scientists and experts of the anticipated ingestion of an additive by man and animals under likely patterns of use . Cancer-causing additives arc the one striking exception . The FDA was given no discretion , no room for shilly-shallying , on the question of cancer vis-a-vis food additives . Worldwide authorities on carcinogenesis ( the study of cancer ) time and again stress that there is no such thing as safely eating a little bit of a chemical known to cause a cancer in man or animals . A safe tolerance simply can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for some diseases ( though the FDA in its inferior wisdom sometimes ignores and disputes this ) . Fortunately , this was codified by Congress in the 1958 Food Additive Amendments . A clause was inserted , sponsored by and named after Congressman Delaney , which prohibited the use of any food additive shown to cause cancer when fed to either animals or humans . Thus if the FDA discovers that a food chemical causes cancer , as determined by legitimately conducted studies , it must ban its use in food ; the government can not make any discretionary excuses . The intent of the 1958 law is clear , as outlined by the House committee report : " to protect the public health . . . to prohibit the use in food of additives which have not been adequately tested to establish their safety .. . " The only question in regulating food additives is : Is it safe or unsafe ? Or is it safe used in X quantities ? That is all . The FDA does not have the authority to make judgments about whether an additive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to additives deemed decep- // tive ) or whether , if it is removed , harm will result to some vested interests in the country . In short , the FDA does not have the power to allow or disallow the use of additives after trading off risk against benefit . Government authorities can not say , " Well , this is of value to consumers ? or industry ? so we can leave it on the market , even though it is not safe , because , in our opinion , the benefits to society outweigh the risks . " Legislators clearly displayed their opposition to any such determination by saying that the Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare ( legal enforcer of the law ) should make no judgment " of whether such effect of an additive results in any added value ' to the consumer of such food or enhances the marketability from a merchandising point of view . " 3 Although FDA administrators do n't seem to have total recall on much of the 1958 law , this is a provision about which they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color additives were omitted from the 1958 law , but they were brought under similar regulations through the Color Additive Amendments of 1960 . And in 1968 , federal legislation was updated again , bringing under FDA control medicated feeds fed to food-producing animals , which might leave residues in the meat . But on additives put directly into meat and poultry ? for example nitrite ? the FDA maintains only advisory capacity . These additives were left under the jurisdiction of the U. S. Department of Agriculture . Under the law the FDA is also charged with protecting us from " indirect " additives , such as packaging chemicals that may migrate into food and accidental environmental contaminants , such as industrial chemicals ( PCBs ) and natural molds ( aflatoxin ) . It is the FDA 's responsibility to decide how much of such chemicals may be tolerated in food , to monitor the residues , to condemn the food if necessary and to prosecute the violators . The Delaney anticancer clause has not been interpreted as applying to such situations . 71 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the essential ways of keeping unproved additives out of food are ( I ) adequate testing of new additives and ( 2 ) the swift removal from the legal list of additives which because of new evidence can no longer be regarded as safe . Animal testing as a proper method of detection of danger is also recognized in the law . What the government does with this authority , however , is another matter . You might say the FDA ? and the USDA ? operate on two premises : " You ca n't find what you 're not looking for , " and " It takes a mountain of data to raise suspicion about an additive 's safety . " LACK OF TESTING We know that many additives in common use have never been adequately tested for safety , except perhaps for acute toxicity , because they were in existence long before the Food Additive Amendments of 1958 were thought of ? and some , especially those on the GRAS list , are now being tested for some aspects of safety . But even additives that have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market may not be adequately screened . The FDA does not routinely require tests for long-term reproductive harm or mutations ( though it does now require some testing for birth defects ) , nor , in a few cases , even for long-term chronic toxicity . FDA toxicologists make a judgment about whether an additive needs to be tested for cancer incitement on the basis of whether it is " toxicologically insignificant " ? that is , is it to be used in small amounts in food not consumed on a large scale ? If so a toxicologist may decide that a lifetime feeding study is not worthwhile because the chemical is " toxicologically insignificant " ? is incapable of causing harm , and demands only a subchronic toxicity test which will not pick up cancer or a number of other diseases . The concept " toxicologically insignificant " is accepted by a few scientists , but not by cancer experts at the National Cancer Institute . They say there 's no such thing when it comes to cancer and // chemicals . It is illegal to use additives which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But how can you prohibit a food additive on that basis if you do n't even ask if it can cause cancer ? Certainly you ca n't strictly enforce the Delaney clause . The official excuse for not requiring mutagenicity tests is that they are not reliable , though this is disputed by a number of experts . In fact , four expert advisory committees have recom mended mandatory mutagenicity testing for food additives , using present test methods .4 Certainly industry is entitled to know specifically what tests and test methods are required of it by the FDA . But indisputably , through scientific advances , some additives we thought safe on the basis of today 's tests may turn out harmful when tested by more sophisticated methods in the future . Conversely , it 's entirely pos sible that some additives now on the blacklist might be shown to be safe . As industry is rightly fond of saying in trying to trip up critics , " Nothing can be proved totally safe for all time . " But the point is , additives can be and should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge . After all , the worst that could happen is that by overestimating an additive 's toxicity we are temporarily deprived use of an additive , one we may not need or want anyway . On the other hand , if the tests spot true danger , we would be spared long-term damage . It is bad enough to consume untested additives . But it is more distressing to be asked to eat additives that are suspect or exhibit danger . Can something still be " generally recognized as safe " when there are a number of unanswered questions about its safety or scientific evidence against it ? Consumer advocates argue " No , " their definition of " safe " being " not apt or able to cause danger or harm . " Again the intent of the law becomes important , as further delineated by the House committee report on the bill : to make manufacturers " pretest any potentially unsafe substances which are to be added to food . " Preclearance or pretesting , then , is the legal intent . 73 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have declared that we do not want to accept any risks from additives . We want them to be prejudged safe ? without hazard . We did not say we wanted to take certain risks as determined by the FDA . If indeed we as a society want to accept some risks , then they should be spelled out ( is exposing one out of , say , ioo , 000 people to cancer , permissible ? ) and the law changed . In the meantime if the FDA were legally honoring our wishes as expressed by law , when hazards show up in additives previously thought safe it would not dawdle but would take immediate action to remove them from the food supply . By permitting industry to continue use of the additive , pending tests to prove it safe , the FDA is in clear violation of the pretesting intent . Sometimes it is a case of simple delay ? as with food colors . Nearly every high-school chemistry student knows that the term " coal-tar dye " is synonymous with hazard . And most of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal-tar derivatives . They were discovered in 1856 by William Perkin , then himself an eighteen-year-old schoolboy , who subsequently earned fame and fortune through his discovery . The dyes he synthesized ( by mixing potassium chromate and aniline , a coal-tar material ) were almost immediately snatched up by the fabric industry because they gave such brilliant , lasting hues ? purple , blue , green , red , yellow . It was n't long before the artificial dyes found their way into food , and soon afterward cases of people being poisoned by the dyes began showing up in the medical literature . The problem at the time was mostly impurities , but as early as 1900 there was worldwide suspicion that the coal-tar dyes might have toxic properties of their own . Eighty were being used in this country then , but , under the stringent supervision of II . W. Wiley , only seven got on the FDA 's approved list in 1907 , after they were tested on dogs and rabbits for acute toxicity . As the demand for artificial color grew , new dyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delisted when it became apparent that // they were unsafe : Green I , Orange I and ' 2 , Yellow i , 2 , 3 , 4 , and Red 4 . Red 4 was subsequently given a provisional listing , allowing it to be used to color maraschino cherries . It is hardly a notable record of safety . As Dr. Jacobson has commented , " The history of approved dyes reads like a guest register in a hotel for transients . " With the Color Additive Amendments of 196o , everyone thought the question of the safety of coal-tar dyes would be answered once and for all . But they did not reckon with the footdragging agility of the FDA . The law had , as one industry spokesman put it , a " permanent part " and a " temporary part . " The " permanent part " called for testing of the dyes to prove them safe before they could be added to food . However , the " temporary part " allowed a " provisional listing " for certain dyes , enabling manufacturers to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific investigations needed as a basis for making determinations " about their safety . Originally , two and a half years were granted for the testing to be completed ; thus , all of the dyes should have been evaluated ? and approved or junked ? by the end of 1962 . But under the law , the FDA was permitted also to grant " extensions " for the completion of the scientific tests . And this it has done with frustrating regularity from that day to this . Since the Color Additive Amendments were passed ? at this writing , thirteen years ago ! ? only two of the ten dyes in use have qualified for a " permanent " listing on the basis of safety tests . All of the others are still only " provisionally " listed without proof that they are safe . There have been yearly extensions of the " provisional " listing for more than a decade , because , as one industry publication explained it , " difficulties have arisen in obtaining permanent listings for color additives . " Understandably , because many simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dyes , Yellow 6 was found to cause blindness in dogs . Violet I , used to stamp meat and put into some foods , is suspected , according to a Canadian study , of causing cancer . Here is what an FAO/WHO Expert Commit-75 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? tee in 1969 said of Citrus Red 2 , the color used to dye the skins of oranges : " Citrus Red 2 has been shown to have carcinogenic activity and the toxicological data available were inadequate to allow the determination of a safe limit ; the Committee therefore recommends that it should not be used as a food color . " The clincher came when the Russians reported in 1970 that Red 2 , used under a " provisional " listing in this country , might cause cancer and reproductive harm . In September 1971 , under pressure , the FDA decided that it was time once again to put the coal-tar dyes under scrutiny , and in a " get tough " ultimatum it gave industry another two years to come up with safety data on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not ? perhaps in good conscience and with everyone looking ? renew the " provisional listing " for Red 2 in 1972 , because of new evidence , both from the Russians and from new FDA studies , showing potential harm . So instead the FDA did nothing ; that is , though failing to grant a provisional listing , it took no action to prohibit continued use of the dye by manufacturers . Attorney Anita Johnson of the Health Research Group calls this FDA silence " a blatant flouting of the law , " claiming that the dye then is under no regulation whatsoever . The FDA argues that legally its failure to renew the Red 2 listing was meaningless ( a strange admission ) , since the dyes automatically remain " provisionally listed " unless the FDA publishes an order revoking the provisional status . For at least a century , these dyes have been under suspicion . It is now thirteen years since a law was passed demanding a show of their safety . During that time we have been eating food dyes at a rapidly increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dye . By 1972 the figure had almost doubled , to 4,000,000 pounds . Ironically , all food dyes are used only to make foods artificially more attractive , sometimes deceptively so , and to render them more devoid of natural flavor and color . // WHEN IS GRAS NOT GRAS ? The FDA 's largest problem is the GRAS list , now " under review . " Under contract the FDA is having monographs compiled from the scientific literature on GRAS items and having some items screened for birth defects and mutations in animals . Incredibly , the FDA is not having GRAS items screened for cancer potential ! The big question is : how will the FDA use information now flowing in on possible hazards ? The FDA has not said that they will use the generated data to ban additives shown unsafe . Dr. Virgil Wodicka , director of the FDA 's Bureau of Foods , has hinted that the test methods used on GRAS items may not be reliable enough to depend on . He said , " We have several contracts under way to test a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as much to test the methods as to test the substances . The novelty of these fields is such that the methods are not generally accepted or agreed to and we need to make sure that the methods are okay before we draw any conclusions from the results . " The FDA , it would appear , is not committed to heeding the results . That many GRAS items may not be safe is generally recognized . In a 1969 internal FDA memo assessing the safety of the GRAS list , several experts in the FDA 's Bureau of Science found many items " suspect " and others about which there were " substantial grounds for concern . " Included were MSG ( " neurotoxicity in newborn mice " ) ; saccharin ( " possible bladder cancer " ) ; brominated vegetable oils ( " growth inhibition and organ pathology in rats " ) ; ammoniated glycyrrhizin ( " possible inducer of adrenal-like difficulties " ) ; potassium bisulfite ( " powerful reductants which may impair nutrients or introduce toxicants " ) ; hydrogen peroxide ( " powerful oxidant which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to ionizing radiation " ) ; 77 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? carob bean gum , ghatti gum , guar gum , sterculia gum , gum tragacanth ( " FAO/WHO Expert Committee refused recently to set acceptable daily intake levels on basis of available evidence " ) . Forty-eight other suspect items were listed , including benzoic acid , sodium benzoate , BHA , and most of the flavorings and spices , which have not been tested . The FDA has data , never published , showing that allyl hep talate , a synthetic pineapple flavor , may cause liver damage when ingested by both rats and dogs . The rat study was completed in 196o , the dog study in 1963 . All six of the dogs on high doses of allyl heptalate died of hemorrhage and cirrhosis of the liver within seven months after the study began ? an alarming mortality rate . Yet the data remain buried and allyl heptalate continues to be used .

Because of an erratic dose response , scientists are troubled over the validity of the study ; nevertheless , as Morris A. Weinberger , director of the Division of Pathology , pointed out , it is impossible to make " a positive statement that carcinogenicity for gamma valerolactone has been ruled out . " In mammalian teratology studies being done by Dr. Bernard Oser 's Food and Drug Research Laboratories in Maspeth , New York ( not connected with the FDA ) , preliminary evidence showed sodium acid pyrophosphate ( SAPP ) , carrageenan and sodium benzoate to cause some fetal harm . Dr. Oser is screening a number of GRAS items for teratogenesis , using mice , rats , ham sters and rabbits . Aspirin too , although it is obviously not a food , is getting a teratology run-through by Dr. Oser . At the insistence of the FDA , // he is using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals are susceptible to birth defects . And the reason he is using aspirin , in the words of one FDA official , is that the drug is such a " potent and reliable teratogen . " It can be depended on to produce birth defects and fetal deaths over and over , as Dr. Oser has confirmed . His experiments show that the offspring of animals given aspirin during pregnancy are born with serious abnormalities ? such as spina bifida , in which the spine is incomplete ( a human born with this defect usually does not survive long ) , and exencephaly , in which the brain is exposed . The doses are high ? between 150 and aoo milligrams per kilogram of body weight daily ? but some humans do take large doses of aspirin . Also , when the doses were lowered , fetal deaths went down but abnormalities went up . There is evidence going back fifteen years that aspirin may cause birth defects , but this is not generally known to the public . Aspirin is considered one of our safest drugs ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocently gulp it down by the handful . Yet the FDA is so sure aspirin is a cause of birth defects that it uses the drug as a yardstick against which to measure the teratogenic power of food additives , and then it does n't tell anyone but just quietly files away the information as it keeps coming in . What happens to a GRAS item that becomes suspect ? Since it can no longer be " generally recognized as safe , " it is no longer legally entitled to exempt status and should be banned until it can meet safety testing requirements demanded of a food additive under a " food additive order . " However , faced with banning many GRAS items under the new " review , " the FDA in July 1970 invented a new legal gimmick , the " interim food additive order , " to skirt the spirit of the law and save such chemicals.5 When evidence of hazard accumulates against a GRAS item to the extent that it can no longer be considered safe , the FDA may indeed sweep it off the GRAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? illustrate tough action . You may think that means it 's removed from food , but this is not so . It may merely have been shifted to another legal status , the " interim " order , under which industry can continue its use pending a promise to produce new studies showing the item safe within a specified period ? usually two or three years . It 's much like the " provisional " listing for colors . The chemical has n't been proved safe ; yet industry can still use it . Essentially , the interim regulation is a grace period giving industry time to come up with studies showing safety or with conflicting studies to confuse the issue , or time to develop a substitute or reformulate their products to eliminate the harmful additive . In the meantime , you and I are guinea pigs as much as the animals in industry 's labs . Such is the case with brominated vegetable oil ( BVO ) , which spurred creation of the first interim order . BVO for years has been used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavoring oils in suspension and give the drink " body . " Scientists had been uneasy about BVO because of a lack of long-term studies and a suspicion that bromine from the BVO might be stored in human tissue . Expressing these concerns , an FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives in 1966 noted that it did n't have enough evidence to evaluate the toxicity of BVO . But by 1970 the same committee said new evidence " suggests that a human epidemiological problem could arise from the uses of BVO " and that it " should not be used as a food additive in the absence of evidence indicating safety . " That new evidence came from two sources . The British Industrial Biological Research Association ( BIBRA ) found that animals did indeed store bromine in their tissues ? notably in the liver , the kidneys and the heart , but also in the spleen , the pancreas and the lungs . Around the same time scientists at the ' Canadian Food and Drug Directorate , testing BVO in the diet of rats for eighty days , found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thyroid damage . The study was published in 1969 . In January 1970 8o FDA DECISION-MAKING the Canadian Health Minister reduced the level of BVO allowed in beverages to fifteen parts per million ( formerly it had been three hundred parts per million ) . Take note that other countries were more cautious . Belgium gave up BVO in 1967 ; Sweden banned it in 1968 , as did Great Britain in 1970 ? on the heels of the new studies at home and in Canada . The Canadian study and action caused a flurry of activity at the FDA . And Dr. Charles Edwards , newly arrived at the FDA as Commissioner* after the departure of Commissioner Ley over the cyclamate incident , made a tough pronouncement that a use-now , test-later philosophy would not be tolerated for food additives . In January 1970 , in a dramatic move , he banished BVO from the GRAS list ; industry , he said , would have six months to eliminate it or come up with evidence for setting a safe level . He said of BVO at a press conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months or for years while we attempt to accumulate all the scientific data needed for an absolute determination of safety or danger . Therefore , we will sometimes make decisions to regulate out of commerce suspect products , on the basis of demonstrated doubt , and we will not regulate them back into society until science has allayed these doubts . " And then what happened ? The lobbying machinery of the food , beverage and chemical industries went to work . It convinced the FDA that the British and Canadian studies were inconclusive and promised that American industry would do its own tests ? if given time . So , in July 1970 , on the very day of the six-month deadline when BVO was to expire or be scientifically cleared , the FDA quietly published notice in the Federal Register that BVO would be authorized at fifteen parts per million in beverages and would be regulated under an unprecedented interim food additive order . The industry was given three years ? until 1973 ? to complete tests under the interim arrangement either exonerating BVO or setting WHAT 'S WRONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which writer Daniel Zwerdling compared with " commissioning ARCO to do a study of whether or not the Alaska pipeline should be built . " The interim order is precisely what Dr. Edwards had six months previously railed against . The interim order has now become an established procedure for dealing with suspect food chemicals ( saccharin was the second item to be thrown into that status ) , and the FDA intends to use it routinely after the review of the GRAS list is completed ? in 1974 at a cost of some $2o million to taxpayers . Two- and three-inchthick monographs ( containing toxicological data from a search of the literature as well as new results from the teratology and mutagenecity studies ) on 593 additives are to be submitted for review to the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology . Then the FDA will review and decide , say officials , whether an additive should be classified as GRAS , banned or put under a food additive order or an interim food additive order , pending further two- or three-year tests . It 's not difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 . And there 's also the question ? if industry is allowed to do the follow-up safety studies on interim additives ? whether we 'll be much better off than before . For it has not been unheard of for labs beholden to industry for their livelihood to consistently come up with sponsor-pleasing results . BUCKING DECISIONS TO THE ACADEMY Sometimes the FDA does not even make the decisions about food additives . Instead , it evades responsibility by referring the matter to the National Academy of Sciences , which then appoints a committee to study the available information on an additive and come up with a recommendation . And so the decision passes from the public arena , where it belongs , to a private one , and finally // trickles down to a select group of seven or eight men who operate in secret and are not accountable to the public . Though some FDA officials say that they dislike consulting the Academy and that they sometimes get bad advice , it is a consistent practice whenever a tough decision with great impact on the food industry must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like the idea of fobbing off our job on someone else , and I do n't think the Academy especially likes it either . But the issues are so controversial we are trying to take them out of the area of special interest . It 's like a court of last resort , although I wish we did n't get pushed there so often . " Another top official believes that " a good proportion of FDA 's problems are traceable to the Academy . " He terms some of their recommendations " miserable . " Although the FDA is not obligated to , it usually follows NAS advice . It is the path of least resistance and the path that usually leads us right to the wolf 's door . The FDA often has better scientific expertise than the men who sit on NAS committees . The National Academy of Sciences , it is true , is an august body , made up of some 950 distinguished scientists elected to it because of their formidable scientific achievements . Many of them are Nobel Prize winners , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Academy committees that make the judgments . The Academy has what it calls its " working arm , " the National Research Council , under which are a number of standing committees , including the Food Protection Committee . When the FDA has a sticky food problem , it asks the Food Protection Committee to set up an ad-hoc subcommittee to study all the data available ( which is supplied by the FDA ) and come up with conclusions and recommendations for action . The men appointed to the committees make grave decisions affecting public health , yet they often hold views contrary to those of consumer advocates and of FDA and National Cancer Institute scientists , and have close connections with industry , which would 83 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? be considered outrageous in FDA personnel . Any FDA scientist making an evaluation on public health who took money on the side for doing research for the companies he was required to regulate would be quickly fired and probably taken to court on conflictof-interest charges . No such strings of delicacy tie the hands of scientists working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subcommittees are or have been employees of industry , or are professors or independent laboratory personnel deriving much of their livelihood from research contracts with industry . The Food Protection Committee is both supported by and beholden to industry . In 1970- ' 71 the food chemical and packaging industries contributed $68,000 to the committee 's general administrative expenses . The committee also has an Industry Liaison Committee , whose head , Arthur T. Schramm , says it was set up by the Academy to give industry a " pragmatic input . " The Food Protection Committee 's conflict of interest in making public decisions is clearly spelled out in one of its pamphlets : " The Food Protection Committee was formed as an advisory group , its primary purpose being to provide critical evaluation of information concerning the relation to the public health of technologies used in food protection for the counsel and encouragement of the food industry and as guidance for public agencies . " ( Italics added . ) At the time the pamphlet was issued , in 1970 , the committee had a Toxicology Committee , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson University in Philadelphia ; ten members served on this subcommittee , and five of them were receiving industry funds either as direct employees ? such as D. W. Fassett , Eastman Kodak Company ? or as directors of laboratories depending on industry money for research . Not surprisingly , the thinking of the Academy subcommittee members reflects their orientations , and their advice to the FDA is invariably antagonistic to the law and to consumer interests . The consulting committees have made it clear they oppose both the // point of view and certain specifics of the Food Additive Laws . The Food Protection Committee has gone on record as favoring repeal of the Delaney clause , and Dr. Coon , often a chairman of the subcommittees , personally calls the clause " scientifically preposterous . " In 1970 the Food Protection Committee issued a report setting guidelines for " toxicologically insignificant " amounts of cancer-causing chemicals in foods , in direct contradiction of the Delaney provision . An ad-hoc committee of leading scientists under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute was so appalled by the report that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total misunderstanding of the problems of chemical carcinogenesis.6 Generally , the Academy subcommittees are picked from a clique of scientists well known for sharing the industry point of view on food chemicals . ( They are sometimes jokingly referred to as the Hertz Rent-a-Scientists . ) They can be counted on at scientific meetings to pop up with the view that additives are good for you , necessary for progress , and harmless . Says Dr. Coon , who chaired the Academy ad-hoc subcommittees on cyclamate , saccharin and Red a : " There is not a shred of evidence or even a basis of reasonable suspicion that any such damaging effects have ever been caused by the additives or pesticides in food consumed in North America . Certainly some defects have been observed in test animals after they have been fed exceedingly large amounts of some additives . But it is a long , frequently too long , step from the observation of the effects of such provocative and bizarre experiments to those of man 's daily diet . " Further indication of the character of judgment expected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William J. Darby , former head of the Department of Biochemistry and director of the Division of Nutrition at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine , who for eighteen years , until his recent retirement , was chairman of the National Academy 's Food Protection Committee . During his tenure Rachel Carson 's Silent Spring , an 85 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? eloquent plea for a sensible examination of pesticides , was published . Miss Carson 's best-selling book was attacked from a number of sources , including the U.S. Department of Agriculture and establishment scientists . One of the most widely circulated and virulent attacks in a scientific magazine was written by Dr. Darby in Chemical and Engineering News . He wrote , " Her ignorance or bias on some of the considerations throws doubt on her competence to judge policy , " and then went on , as Fred Graham in his book Since Silent Spring recounts , to refute statements Rachel Carson never made . Dr. Darby is now president of the Nutrition Foundation , an industry-supported group , and is still a fervent crusader against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " alarm the public unnecessarily . " Those who do n't bend so easily to the prevailing opinions of the Academy committees do n't get on them or are n't invited back . A former executive director of the Food Protection Committee , Paul Johnson , who held that position for fifteen years until 1971 , said he could n't remember a time when an actual elected member of the Academy served on a working committee judging food safety . Dr. Wilhelm Heuper , formerly of the National Cancer Institute , was appointed to the Food Protection Committee for one term , but was not reappointed , in his view because he took a tough stand against cancer-causing additives . James Crow , a geneticist at the University of Wisconsin , was called in by an Academy subcommittee as a special consultant on the mutagenic potential of cyclamate , but when he disagreed with the committee members his views were totally ignored , though he is a topflight scientist in the field , and no mention of his dissenting opinion was included in the Academy report to the FDA . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent as others available to the government , and they frequently do not include an authority in the field under study . It 's not surprising that the reports of these Academy subcommittees often // contain scientific gibberish , embarrassing both to the prestigious Academy and to the FDA . Their recommendations invarably follow a predictable pattern of " do nothing now ; there 's no imminent danger , and we need more study " ? which is a safe bet . In the meantime the public is left exposed to the hazard in question . The Academy subcommittees have seen little or no danger in a long string of additives , including cyclamate , saccharin , MSG and the food dye Red 2 , all of which at the time had substantial scientific evidence against them . The subcommittees have been strongly criticized by consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader . And some Academy members privately find the subcommittees ' recommendations , which come out under the imprint of the prestigious Academy , embarrassing scientifically . To try to correct this , the Academy 's president , Dr. Philip Handler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviews the subcommittees ' reports prior to release . However , the reviewers can only recommend , and have no authority to compel their lesser colleagues to change interpretations or advice . In fact , the ad-hoc committees are treated gingerly by the Academy staff , who are reluctant to offend them . Said one staffer , " These men are volunteers ; they donate their time , and the only thing they get out of it is traveling expenses and the prestige of associating with the Academy . " Surely the impropriety of referring public decisions to such NAS committees is evident . As Dr. Epstein has said , " The close identification of the NAS-NRC Food Protection Committee with industrial interests make it singularly inappropriate as a major source of independent ' advice . " 7 One has only to consider the scandal of monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) to see how right he is . Anybody who has ever had Chinese Restaurant Syndrome , caused by an overenthusiastic use of MSG in Oriental food , knows that this chemical ca n't be all good for you . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? damage and affects only certain persons , it can be frightening when the numbness creeps up the back of your neck and you begin to have headaches and a tightening of the chest , typical symptoms of CRS , as it 's called . Scientists once thought that MSG , the sodium salt of glutamic acid , which is a naturally occurring amino acid , was one of the most harmless chemical substances . It was isolated from seaweed in 1908 , and for years the white chemical substance has been made and sold in the U.S. by bulk ( mostly under the label Accent ) . It 's now in thousands of processed foods to " enhance flavor " and is virtually impossible to avoid . It 's in canned vegetables and frozen foods galore , in TV dinners , all kinds of convenience foods , in soups , soup mixes , salad dressings , mayonnaise , baked goods , even potato chips and crackers . MSG was also in baby foods until 1969 , when baby-food manufacturers removed it on the heels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous to infant nervous systems . Harvard nutritionist Dr. Jean Mayer said MSG had no nutritional value and was put in baby foods to please mothers ' taste buds and to conceal the overuse of starches and the underuse of meats . The very day after Dr. Mayer told a women 's press club audience , " I would take the damn stuff out of baby food , " an agitated industry surrendered and removed it . Perhaps if we had waited for action from the FDA , it would still be in baby food . For the FDA had the same evidence as Dr. Mayer and Ralph Nader and Jim Turner that MSG was suspect , but made no move to curtail its use . In fact , to this day ( 1973 ) the FDA considers MSG " generally recognized as safe , " despite staggering evidence against it . Dr. John W. Olney , a psychiatrist at Washington University School of Medicine , first brought to light in 1969 the fact that MSG caused irreversible brain damage in infant animals . His studies spurred more studies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Nelson , Dr. Olney viewed what had happened since his original revelation : 88 MSG-induced brain damage has been demonstrated in infant mice , rats , chicks , monkeys . The effect occurs following oral as well as subcutaneous administration and at doses of MSG which do not differ in order of magnitude from those used in foods . Obesity and neuroendocrine disturbances following treatment of infant rodents with MSG have been confirmed by neuroendocrine specialists . A recent report from Japan , which has been confirmed in my laboratory , documents lesions induced in fetal brain by administration of MSG to pregnant mice . Behavioral disturbances , including learning deficits , have been shown in adult rats treated with MSG in infancy . It has also been shown that MSG penetrates and is accumulated in the particular brain region known to be most vulnerable to damage from this food chemical . Several additional compounds have now been found which produce the MSG-type lesion ; each is similar to MSG in molecular structure and in neuroexcitatory action ; each increases the neurotoxicity of MSG if administered with it.8 He documented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " That MSG intake can irreversibly damage the brain of infant animals is well accepted now by any serious student of the neurosciences . Yet MSG remains on the GRAS list today to be used freely in any foods , in any amounts and for any age group . How is this explained ? " Dr. Olney has an explanation : " an industry-arranged whitewash " carried out by a largely industry-oriented committee of the National Academy of Sciences , appointed to assess the hazards of MSG . " I remember it well , " Maurice Chevalier might have sung . For , after Dr. Olney published his findings in the May 1969 Science , there was a scramble at the FDA to justify the presence of MSG on the GRAS list . In September of that year Commissioner Ley testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Health along with Dr. Olney , and presented evidence from four studies showing that MSG was safe . The only hitch was that the WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? commissioner had been misinformed , as Jim Turner found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomplete and two did not exist . One of the studies touted was one I had done with chicks to determine whether MSG caused fetal defects . When it was cited to the senators as proof of safety , the study had barely begun and the results were far from conclusive . I had tested only 18o eggs ? a very preliminary study . Particularly disturbing was the fact that the policy-makers attached great credence to this partially finished test which apparently revealed no damage , while refusing at the same time to countenance an impeccable 13,000-egg study on cyclamate which revealed severe skeletal defects . It was a striking instance of selectively sifting scientific evidence to ratify agency policy . Confronted with a messy situation , the FDA contracted with the National Academy ( whose services are not free ? the taxpayers pay for its advice ) to set up a committee to evaluate MSG in baby food . In July 1970 the committee reported that " the risk associated with using MSG in foods for infants is extremely small . " The report stated that since the committee could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was recommending that the chemical be eliminated from infant foods , but it added : The committee found no evidence of hazard from the responsible use of MSG in foods for older children and adults , except for those who are individually sensitive to the substance . The flavorenhancing property of MSG is considered to be beneficial to the general consumer in these age groups . Note : the committee is here weighing a benefit ? risk trade-off which exceeds its charge and which is clearly forbidden by law from entering into FDA judgments . The committee , therefore , recommends that use of MSG be permitted in processed foods for these groups and that such foods be clearly labeled to indicate the presence of added MSG for the information of those who wish to avoid it . Sale of MSG in packages for institutional and home consumer use need not be curtailed . // Dr. Olney says he tried to pound home to the committee the very slim margin of safety in his experiments ? only eight to one . A one-pound monkey showed brain damage after being given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing usual amounts of MSG . The mice he tested were a sight . Those given MSG daily in the first ten days of life were obese and stunted at nine months old ? apparently because MSG damaged the part of the brain that controls the appetite mechanism . The MSG-fed mice were lethargic ; some females were sterile ; their livers , uteri and ovaries were affected . Dr. Olney noted that the small percent-age of brain cells destroyed in the infants was " evidence of a subtle process of brain damage in the developmental period which could easily go unrecognized were it to occur in the human infant under routine circumstances . " Yet the NAS committee gave more weight to two negative studies on MSG hurriedly done by two laboratories which derive most of their income from industry-contracted research . In his 1972 Senate testimony , Dr. Olney ? at the senators ' request ? gave his views on this negative research , pointing out flaws that the NAS committee had failed to examine . He also said that there were " many reputable neuropathologists in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authenticity of evidence , " ? but except for one those chosen for the committee had little or no qualifications in neuropathology . But most shock-ing to the senators was Olney 's disclosure that five of the seven members of the NAS committee that had exonerated MSG in 1970 had industry connections ? some of them directly with MSG manufacturers or with baby-food companies . The chairman of the Academy 's MSG committee was Lloyd J. Filer , Jr. , a professor of pediatrics at the University of Iowa Medical School , who while serving as chairman was under contract to do research on MSG paid for by Gerber Products , Inc. , a lead-ing baby-food manufacturer , and the International Mineral and Chemical Corporation , the producer of Accent and of 8o percent 91 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? of the MSG sold in this country . Another committee member trusted with an objective appraisal of MSG was George M. Owen , a researcher at Children 's 1-Iospital in Columbus , Ohio , who shortly before his appointment to the committee had also done work for Gerber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. Zapp , Jr. , with Du Pont , and Virgil B. Robinson with Dow Chemical Company . Rounding out the industry representatives on the committee was Lloyd W. Hazelton of Hazelton Labs in Virginia , which also has done testing of MSG for International Mineral and Chemical . Iazelton also appeared at the Senate hearings as an industry spokesman on behalf of the Grocery Manufacturers Association.9 All of this caused Senator Charles Percy , a member of the Senate committee , to explode : " Here is the same person acting as judge and jury . Regardless of his objectivity and competence it appears there is a conflict of interest here . Are n't there enough scientists in the United States so we can select a panel that would be above reproach ? " Percy compared the apparent conflict of interest on the Academy panels with that forbidden by the Bar Association and the Supreme Court , and suggested a Congressional investigation of the NAS committee procedures . The National Academy was offered a chance to send a spokesman to the hearings to testify on its behalf , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently submit a document to the Senate committee , defending the Academy 's procedures . He admitted that the Academy did not prohibit persons from serving on committees because of apparent conflict of interest.10 Obviously , with twenty studies at last count showing MSG to possess hazard and four ( all industry-supported ) showing no hazard , this chemical ca n't be generally recognized as safe . Nor is the problem solved with its removal from baby foods . As Dr. Olney stresses , it is still present in adult foods at significant levels ? in fact , a recent Academy survey revealed that more MSG is used in the United States than any other GRAS item ? and these foods // are given to infants also . Many babies eat right from the table today , as a trend toward solid food at earlier ages increases . What is the good of taking MSG out of baby foods , if babies still get it and parents are n't warned about its presence ? There is no warning on food cans or packages . Furthermore , whether MSG may be hazardous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproductive damage are unsettled questions . In any event , the point remains that the FDA 's decision-making function is compromised when it fobs off decisions on any group ? particularly one that is private , secret , and ca n't be held publicly accountable . 93 // Despite its legal mandate to safeguard the public health , the FDA , like other governmental agencies , becomes more identified with the industry it is regulating than the consumer it 's supposed to be protecting . It 's the bureaucratic disease , and it comes from too much elbow-rubbing . Many government officials assume that the consumer and the food industry have identical interests . What 's good for one is good for the other , to paraphrase the onetime head of General Motors . There 's no disputing that industry has the ear of our government guardians far more than do consumers . At the top the pressures are considerable . It is reported that when Robert Finch , then Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , was compelled by law to ban cyclamate , he was immediately contacted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artificial sweetener in its wide-selling Diet-Pepsi ) , who was also a personal friend of President Nixon 's . For others , though , it is a sharing of like interests with industry personnel or buying a ticket for the future . Many FDA decision-makers either come from industry or plan to go there later . It 's been called the " revolving-door " policy and the " deferred bribe . " Commissioner Edwards , prior to taking the position of head of the FDA , was with Booze , Allen and Hamilton , management consultants . When his deputy , James D. Grant , resigned , he became assistant to the chairman of the Board of CPC International , which owns Best Foods . The director of the Bureau of Foods , Dr. Virgil Wodicka , was formerly with Hunt- // Wesson Foods . When there was a recent flap over the food color Red 2 , one of the men sent by industry to discuss the situation was the former chief of the colors division of FDA . The interchange of personnel is so legion that some meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble a reunion more than a conference . In a study called " Who 's Who at FDA , " Dr. Jacobson notes that twenty-two out of fifty-two top FDA officials were former employees of regulated industries or trade associations . ' It is not unusual at scientific meetings for an FDA person to publicly defend industry if it is attacked . Even the lower echelons at Food and Drug are exposed to constant contact with industry but are very much insulated from consumers . Industry representatives ? from companies , from laboratories doing industry-sponsored research , from trade associations ? are constantly showing up at the door , either with or without appointments . They can walk into any office , be given data and be treated like friendly colleagues . But let a consumer come in and ask for the same information , and he is often treated with suspicion . Industry representatives can walk in , but consumers must fight their way in . Recently , industry people who were concerned about some damaging new FDA data on Red 2 asked to come in and discuss it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph Nader 's Health Research Group asked for the same privilege they were initially refused . Only after vigorous protest were they too permitted to see the ongoing studies . What is common knowledge to industry is often kept secret from the public . Though this has lessened under new interpretations of the Freedom of Information Act , the FDA still gripes about taking time to dig out the information ; yet its staff spends hour after hour , day after day talking with industry . I personally have attended dozens of meetings with industry , but I have never been to a single one with consumer representatives . There are other ways too of hiding information to try to keep it out of the public eye , circumventing the Freedom of Information 95 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? Act . A new propensity has developed among some FDA officials to hold telephone conferences with industry , in which formal proceedings need not be kept in detail . In case something goes wrong or concessions are made , there are no tracks across the bureaucratic carpet with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two memos of meetings : a detailed one for the commissioner and another , a short summary , to be circulated among participants and made available for public information . How little the consumer is listened to was illustrated by a recent reaction of the Department of Agriculture when Griffith Labs asked approval for use of the chemical SAPP in hot dogs and other sausage meats . The USDA received 447 public comments , nearly 90 percent of them from consumers who opposed approval because they did n't want more unnecessary additives in food . Even some scientists in Agriculture argued against using SAPP for accelerated curing , saying that the new reduced cycle might fail to kill dangerous organisms . Nevertheless industry wanted it ( SAPP also cuts manufacturing costs and increases profits ) , and industry got it . Said Dr. Kenneth McEnroe of the Agriculture Department , " Consumers told us they did n't like SAPP and did n't want it , but they did n't provide any data that was truly useful and industry did . " 2 It is not that government decision-makers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly eroded by industry contacts and the consideration of short-term effects on industry instead of long-term effects on consumers . Attorneys working with Ralph Nader captured the spirit of the situation precisely when they wrote : The food industry , its trade associations and research foundations , is well financed and highly organized to pressure the FDA . Industry representatives visit , phone and write FDA officials about every decision that could affect their financial position , constantly badgering , cajoling , presenting facts , figures , etc. , to persuade // officials to their points of view . There is no comparable input from the consumer side . Industry pressures gradually erode even the most vigilant FDA officials . In delicate situations where risk is suspect and not proved , industry presence makes the difference . If the FDA acts on the side of caution and prohibits an additive , industry can quantify their losses in terms of a dollars and cents economic loss . Human loss , on the other hand , is never a definite sum of money .3 A possible catastrophe from cancer or mutations to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one official 's mistake , whereas an immediate one affecting industry decidedly can . Confronted with threats to his advancement and little or no pressure or rewards from the consumer side , the policy-maker may give in . If he resists , he may actually be punished by his superiors or colleagues for being " overly conscientious , " " rash " or " irresponsible " or " unethical " for " unduly alarming the public " or " making the agency look bad . " Particularly disturbing is that both industry and FDA play down the danger from food additives . It is common for spokesmen from both to lament the " crisis in confidence in the food supply , " which consumer advocates and some scientists bring . Dr. ' William Darby , president of the industry-supported Nutrition Foundation , has on several occasions criticized the " premature , nonobjective , biased statements " of scientists " who undermine the public confidence in the food supply . " It is , he contends , " a betrayal of trust . " FDA personnel at meetings have also echoed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of confidence in the FDA and the food supply . What is the public to think after years of assurance that its food supply is the safest , upon learning that food is not free of filth ? that there are only " filth guidelines " allowing certain percentages of insects , rodent droppings , mold and other debris in food ; that fish contain unacceptable levels of mercury ; that chickens are contaminated with industrial compounds such as PCBs ; that additives by the hundreds have never been tested , and 97 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? that when beginning to take on the appearance of the Emperor 's new clothes . To counteract the public reaction , industry has stepped up its public-information programs , such as the one launched by the Institute of Food Technologists to give the press and the communications media the " straight " story on such controversial food topics as the significance of mercury in food , the use of nitrites and nitrates , and the nutritional changes in processed food . The IFT has set up " expert committees " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry point of view in a crisis . Included on the panels is Dr. Darby , Dr. Emil Mrak and Arthur T. Schramm ? all known for their permissive attitudes toward chemicals in foods . Dr. Darby and Schramm have long griped about the lack of a " balanced " point of view in the lay press when it comes to food additives . Right after the cyclamate ban , Schramm , in his capacity as chairman of the National Academy of Sciences ' Industry Liaison Committee , wrote a " Dear Bill " letter to Darby which some scientists considered at the least indelicate considering Darby 's position as chairman of the Food Protection Committee .. Schramm complained that recent developments concerning the safety of certain GRAS chemicals have put the entire food processing industry in an embarrassingly defensive position ; ? one that is not warranted by the objective scientific facts . The communications media , particularly TV , have given considerable publicity to experimental data actually having little or no bearing on safety , but presented in such manner as to dispose a large majority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , to TV reports on chick embryo studies involving cyclamates and subcutaneous injection studies involving sodium glutamate MSG . Both reports were inconclusive with respect to the safety of their use in food , but this type of psy- // chological pressure has already taken its toll in the defensive action recently employed by the baby food manufacturers . The entire atmosphere growing out of such TV programming , coupled with politically oriented Congressional hearings and careless statements by apparently qualified publicity seeking individuals , is one of economic terrorism . Many of the members of the Industrial Liaison Panel , recognizing this sinister development , have expressed strong feelings on the subject and have asked me , as chairman of the Industry Committee , to urge you , as chairman of the Food Protection Committee , to take steps necessary to secure equal time for qualified members of the scientific community to put this matter in proper perspective for the public . In other words , Schramm was pressuring Darby to make way for an industry point of view . The FDA , for its part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interview with FDA Papers ( now called FDA Consumer ) of March 1972 , Dr. Wodicka was asked , " Is the American food supply safe at the present time ? " Answer : " It is safer than it has ever been before , and as safe as we know how to make it . . . " Dr. Wodicka went on to list the priority concerns of the FDA about food safety . In order , they were foodborne disease such as botulism and aflatoxin ; malnutrition ; environmental contaminants such as industrial chemicals ; naturally occurring toxins ? that is , natural poisons in vegetables , such as cabbage , lima beans and potatoes , and in certain seafoods ; pesticide residues ; and , sixth , food additives . In Dr. Wodicka 's view , any hazard from food chemicals is the lowest rung on the ladder ; preceding it are any number of problems in which food processors have the least direct implication ? malnutrition , environmental contaminants , natural toxins . The only item on the list for which food processors are directly responsible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDA 's to correct , is food additives . Depressing it to a low priority , however , diminishes the need for action . 99 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? Even the toxins put into our food by Mother Nature alarm the FDA more than man-made chemical additives . Of late the FDA has begun to focus on ferreting out natural hazards in common foods such as vegetables . It is true that cabbage may contain a goiter-promoting chemical ; spinach may contain nitrate ( which may explain why kids spit it out ? they may be smarter than adults ) ; potatoes , especially when sprouting or blighted , contain solaninc , which has long been known to be toxic . According to studies there are hundreds of other natural toxins in the food we consider the safest . And Dr. Julius Coon , who has made a study of the subject , contends that our ordinary food is so filled with toxins that to keep them " in balance " ? so that they neutralize each other or so that we do n't consume one toxin i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a single food but get our vitamins and minerals from a wide variety of sources . Strangely , some proponents of food additives use the same argument , saying that the more additives we use the better , so that we do n't consume great quantities of any one which could be toxic . Scientifically , of course , there is no reason to exonerate age-old foods from a poisoning capacity . And people who hark back to natural food as " pure " and " good for us " in reaction against synthetic foods may be as mistaken as those who say all additives are perfectly safe . After all , birth defects and cancer and disease have plagued man since the Creation , and some of the trouble may literally come from the apple . Natural foods , like many chemicals , simply have not been tested for long-term toxicity and should he studied , since all chemicals , even natural ones , may have some risk . However , it is folly to concentrate on natural foods as public policy while ignoring potential hazards from synthetic food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toxins , of which we know little , why compound the danger by adding synthetic chemicals to foods ? Even when legally compelled to take action on food chemicals , ioo INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT COALITION the FDA downplays it , minimizing the hazard to such an extent that the public is bound to wonder why it was necessary . In banning cyclamates , Secretary Robert Finch apologized at his press conference , " I have acted under the provisions of the law because . . . I am required to do so . " Other HEW officials let it be known they thought enforcing this law was a lot of poppycock . After mercury , lead and arsenic were found in fish , beef , shellfish and chicken livers , Surgeon General Jesse R. Steinfeld testified that these were extraordinary findings in the country 's generally safe food supply and insisted that " the country is not presently faced with widespread , serious human health hazards . " Senator Philip Hart of Michigan , on the other hand , said he found the news some of " the most depressing " he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable oils were removed from the GRAS list because they caused heart lesions in animals , the FDA announced that the oils were not " considered an imminent hazard to humans . " After FDA officials found PCBs , considered more acutely toxic than DDT , in fish , cheese , milk and eggs on grocery shelves , and estimated that half the human population carries PCBs in their tissues , Dr. Albert Kolbye , Jr. , deputy director of the FDA 's Bureau of Foods , said in a speech in New York that despite their widespread presence , the chemicals were not considered " a threat to human health . " " I think the problem is under control , " he said . When forced to ban from feed the cattle-fattening hormone DES , Commissioner Charles Edwards insisted ; " DES has been used in the feed of cattle and sheep for nearly two decades without a single known instance of human harm . " Edwards stressed that DES " is not a public health problem , " but that it had to be banned anyway under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' voice was full of regret . r0I WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? The most common rotten chestnut thrown into nearly every FDA press release announcing action on a food additive is that " there is absolutely no evidence that humans have been harmed by this chemical . " But it is never followed up by the fact that nobody has looked to see whether humans have been harmed or that there is absolutely no way of determining such harm , since isolating a cause ? effect relationship when millions of people are eating thousands of chemicals is a needle-in-the-haystack proposition . Thus this statement , as every scientist knows and every official at FDA should know , is meaningless and serves no purpose except to deceive an unknowing public into believing there is , therefore , no reason to be concerned . Similarly common in government terminology is " There is no imminent or immediate hazard to health " or " no public-health danger , " followed by " therefore , chemical X will remain on the market until January I " of whatever year . What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it means we did not find chemical X had arsenical properties that will kill three fourths of the population who eat it in two days , then there is no " imminent hazard . " But if it means that every day the chemical continues in existence tissue cells may be harmed , then there is " imminent " ( or , as the dictionary defines it , " impending " ) danger . Perhaps not coincidentally , the " imminent hazard " has an incubation period that usually matches the time it takes industry to use up its stocks and get rolling with newly formulated products . Obviously , a hazard is a hazard ? whether you eat it on July I or six months later on January T. Can it matter to a mother who has a child born with no arms whether she ate Red 2 , a teratogenic food dye , during the period when it was not governmentally classified as an " imminent hazard " ? To her it was an imminent hazard . And to someone whose system is overloaded with chemical carcinogens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an imminent hazard . " The concept is based on that outmoded Ioa INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT COALITION philosophy of acute toxicity . The consumer can not be harmed by immediately cutting off the sale of food additives when they are declared unsafe . If it seems harsh to lower the boom on industry immediately , instead of granting prolonged recuperation periods , remember several things : I. Industry is perfectly aware of its legal reponsibility as the makers and users of food chemicals to prove them safe . 2 . Most chemicals are produced by large companies which are knowledgeable and have Washington lobbyists and lawyers galore . 3 . There are usually warnings of danger from preceding acute or subchronic or other tests , all of which lead up to the final conclusion . Sometimes studies are not even undertaken unless there is suggestion of hazard in the first place . Thus industry is usually forewarned ; if it fails to heed the warnings we should not be forced to subsidize its irresponsibility with our bodies ? nor for that matter with our tax money through loss compensation , as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is permitted to use these additives on the presumption that they are safe . As Representative Delaney commented recently , " The nation 's health and that of future generations demand that regulatory agencies immediately stop the practice of vesting chemicals with rights . Chemicals do not have rights : people do . Chemicals generally are highly toxic and should be considered guilty of being hazardous until proved innocuous . " Since industry reaps the profits from food additives , it should take the risks . The situation should not be turned topsy-turvy so that we assume the health risks for the economic gain of the food producers . It is not only their legal but their moral responsibility to conduct rigorous tests for safety and to anticipate dangers that may arise . Since so few additives have been tested , industry should not be surprised when they turn out harmful , and it should be prepared to take the consequences . 103 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? THE ANTI-DELANEY CRUSADE The Delaney clause states : " No additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it is found , after tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of food additives , to induce cancer in man or animal . . . " It is our most ironclad protection . Naturally , because the Delaney clause robs industry of its customary influ ence on FDA decisions , it is opposed by industry , which has been recently joined by top officials at the VDA , on President Nixon 's staff and in the parent department , HEW . In March 1972 , Foster D. Snell , Inc. , Biological Science Labora tories , sent to a number of scientists ? including myself ? a ques tionnaire to gather opinion on the dangers of saccharin and whether or not the Delaney clause should be repealed . The solicitation did not appear objective and bore the stamp of an anti-Delaney-clause campaign . Enclosed was the statement of an anon ymous physician ; a few excerpts will illustrate the quality of his bias : Last week it was announced that saccharin was to be removed from the GRAS ( Generally Recognized As Safe ) list . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which means that if one laboratory animal under ANY set of circum stances , no matter how bizarre , can be shown to develop a malignant tumor , then that product , by law , must be summarily removed from the marketplace , no matter how useful or critical it is to our society . At the present time a few rats in the Wisconsin Alumni Re-search Foundation study show signs of bladder tumors as a result of being given dosages of saccharin far beyond the range of reasonable scientific investigation . The two-year-old rats ( equal to a human 's 90 years ) were fed the equivalent in human consump tion of 875 bottles of diet soda per day for a lifetime . If any one // of these tumors proves to be malignant , then by law , the last remaining non-nutritive sugar substitute will be removed from our culture . Numerous inquiries by Dr. Samuel Epstein to Snell failed to determine who had asked for the survey , who was paying for it and for what purpose it was to be used . Finally , Food Chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " ad hoc committee comprised of unnamed physicians and firms for the fair evaluation of saccharin , " and that the physician whose views were expressed was Dr. Robert C. Atkins of New York City ( author of Dr. Atkins ' Diet Revolution ) . Moreover , Food Chemical News reported speculation that the FDA was , in fact , behind the poll.4 Ever since the banning of cyclamate , government and industry , almost in unison , have been quietly hammering away at the Delaney clause , trying to think of politically acceptable ways to modify it , which per se would destroy it . Pressures mounted again against the law in 1972 when the government was compelled to ban the carcinogen DES , which when put into cattle feed left residues in meat . During the controversy , one of President Nixon 's advisers declared that the Delaney clause would have to be " reviewed . " In September 1972 , before Senator Nelson 's subcommittee , Commissioner Edwards devoted most of his testimony to presenting arguments on why the Delaney clause was scientifically invalid . In October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments and deplored the action against DES , " whose benefits to society in terms of food production and nutrition have to be weighed against its theoretical risks as a carcinogen . " The Delaney clause , he noted , made a weighing of that risk ? benefit impossible . He continued : The Delaney Amendment represents one extreme in the continuing search for accommodation between benefit and risk . Unfortunately , the Delaney Amendment is at the extreme of no accommodation . 105 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? It fails to accept that in fourteen years since its passage , technology to measure in parts per billion has at time outstripped our ability to interpret the meaning of such findings . We are approaching the capability of detecting the presence of single molecules of materials under study . Yet , even if it were possible to show that a single molecule of a carcinogen produced no effect in animals or man , that material would still have to be removed from the food supply . And if the Delaney Amendment ? as some are suggesting ? were broadened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dilemma we would face would be immense . It seems to me that time and technology have brought us to the point where Congress and the scientific world must reevaluate some of its thinking about regulatory law . It is simply not enough to hand down legal dictates that allow no measure of scientific judgment and reflect no limit on human abilities to achieve absolute safety in anything . The battle lines on the Delaney clause are now rather firmly drawn . On one side are certain high-ranking government officials ? the " policy-makers " ? and industry , including a number of scientists working in private laboratories under contract for industry . For example , at the 1970 White House Conference on Food , Nutrition and Health , Dr. Leon Golberg of the Institute of Experimental Pathology and Toxicology , Albany Medical College , gave an impassioned plea for repealing the Delaney clause and received a rousing hand of applause from industry representatives . On the other side , supporting the Delaney clause , are consumer advocates such as James Turner and Ralph Nader 's Health Research Group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ? perhaps most importantly ? the whole weight of the most respected scientific opinion in the world on chemical carcinogenesis , including the National Cancer Institute . As Dr. Epstein , in testimony before Senator Nelson 's committee , has noted ; " It is striking that no such criticisms of the Delaney clause have emerged from qualified independent experts , io6 INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT COALITION from the scientific staff of the National Cancer Institute , from the membership of the International Union Against Cancer , from the American Cancer Society , or from qualified scientific representatives of citizen , consumer and public-interest groups . " All of the clamor to change the Delaney clause , he points out , comes from " captive " industry spokesmen , distinguished in their " lack of expertise and lack of national recognition in the field of chemical carcinogenesis. " 6 Dr. Epstein 's contention was upheld in January 1973 when the prestigious New York Academy of Sciences , noting increased activity to destroy the Delaney clause , called together more than a hundred prominent scientists , lawyers and executives from government agencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that there was no justification for adding a carcinogen to food regardless of the so-called benefits . When asked , all twelve participants chosen by the attending press to answer questions agreed they could not think of a single scientist outside industry who openly favored a change in the Delaney clause . It 's important to note that the FDA was conspicuously absent from tins conference , despite repeated invitations to attend . The commissioner sent no representative , and reportedly half a dozen staffers who had accepted invitations to participate hastily withdrew . Thus , FDA officials openly displayed their bias against a law they were hired to uphold . In contrast , the day after the New York meeting , Dr. Wodicka reportedly went to Florida to confer with industry representatives who had at Dr. Edwards ' suggestion formed a " Citizens ' Commission " to set up an international symposium to study the broad question of " benefit ? risk " of food additives . Dr. Edwards , irked by the Delaney clause , had urged such an international symposium after his September testimony to Senator Nelson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with industry groups to set up the ill-named Citizens ' Commission . It is composed of and financed by the Rockefeller Foundation , the Macy Foundation , 107 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? the National Science Board , the Nutrition Foundation and the Food and Drug Law Institute , and its express purpose is to destroy the Delaney clause . Consumers ' Union when invited to participate flatly refused . Both industry and the FDA try to make the swirl of argument around the Delaney clause sound scientific rather than economic , fearing that the latter would be blatantly offensive to the public . Thus opponents , including the FDA , have drawn up a list of " scientific objections " to the clause ? objections which in top scientific circles are viewed in the most charitable language as illinformed . Here are the arguments you 'll hear time and again from the FDA and industry scientists in attacking the Delaney clause , and the reasons why top cancer experts disagree : 1 . It is unnecessary to ban all cancer-causing chemicals , as the law demands , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Garbage , " is the scientific retort . This argument denies everything we know about carcinogenic effects , essentially that they are cumulative . Therefore , who gives a hang even if we could establish a so-called safe dose for a single cancer-causing chemical ( which is unlikely ) , because such a " safe " dose would be meaningless in the context of our lives . We would still be taking in small doses of carcinogens from various sources : a whiff of polluted air , a bit of contaminated food , the inhalation of cigarette smoke , all of which would add up to make a so-called safe dose a lethal dose . Dr. Umberto Saffiotti , a supporter of the Delaney clause , has repeatedly pointed out that it is impossible to set such a " safe " level because no one knows how little of a carcinogen it takes to trigger cancer at the cellular level , and the effects of small levels of carcinogens we are exposed to are unknown and cumulative , and potentiating to each other . " We have produced no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he declared . " Exposure to cancerproducing agents . . . shows that the tissue which is exposed io8 INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT COALITION acquires new susceptibility . The tissue stores the damage , so to speak , so that even with low levels of a carcinogen if the cells are exposed to additional insults , the damage can add up so you reach a level where a tumor develops . All of this gives us a situation in which we can not assume that low level exposure to carcinogens may be insignificant . " His viewpoint , which is also that of his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute , is shared by the weight of scientific opinion throughout the world . A report from a committee of international scientists for the World Health Organization is unequivocal in its opposition to setting any safe doses for carcinogens . " The uncertainty of the extrapolation of the safe dose to man , and lack of knowledge of the possible summating or potentiating effects of different carcinogens in the total human environment preclude the establishment of a safe dose at the present time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the opposite view ? that eating small amounts of carcinogens is not dangerous ? such as Dr. Leon Golberg , admit that they are " in the minority . " Yet it is this minority , instead of the National Cancer Institute , that the FDA listens to . 2 . The Delaney clause is invalid because any chemical , administered in high enough doses , will produce cancer in animals . Dr. Golberg has written : " It is safe to predict that , by appropriate choice of dose , concentration of solution and frequency of administration by the subcutaneous route , any chemical agent can be shown to be a carcinogen in the rat and probably also in other species of laboratory rodent . " Although it is true that subcutaneous injections of chemicals do frequently cause cancer , especially local lesions , it is unusual for chemicals ingested by animals to cause cancer , and the Delaney clause specifies ingestion as the route of administration . In a study by Bionetics Research Laboratories done in 1970 , mice were fed 12o compounds at the highest doses they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chemicals produced cancer.8 109 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? 3 . Our scientific methods of detecting scant amounts of carcinogens are now becoming so sophisticated that if we ban everything that contains even a molecule of a carcinogen , we 'll starve . As other arguments are discredited , this one is being increasingly put forth to obfuscate the issue , and at first blush it seems to have merit . Dr. Edwards used it extensively in his September 1972 Senate testimony . He said in effect that the concept of zero tolerance and zero residues of cancer-causing substances would make mandatory the banning of " all animal and plant products containing not only detectable levels of naturally occurring carcinogens , as well as those having the potential to contain a few molecules of a naturally occurring carcinogen , but also all food containing such carcinogenic environmental contaminants as traces of radioactive materials . " This line of argument , which implies that we would have to ban virtually all foods , is an enormous red herring . It is true that advancing methodology makes it possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per billion . However , Dr. Edwards ' argument applies mainly to accidental residues , such as pesticides , that may inadvertently and without our knowledge get into food and that as such do not come under the Delaney clause anyway . Legal interpretations of the clause made by the FDA itself make it applicable only to direct or indirect additives in food or in animal feed which may leave residues in food . One might think from the FDA 's protestations that it had had to invoke the Delaney clause at every turn as science turned up new methods of detecting low levels of carcinogens . Such is hardly the case . According to FDA general counsel , Peter B. Hutt , in the fifteen years since the amendment was passed it has been invoked only twice ! ? 4 . The Delaney clause is unscientifically restrictive because it allows no room for scientific judgment . Industry spokesmen insist that if cancer shows up in only one rat fed a certain chemical , no matter how sleazy or invalid the 11o INDUSTRY-GOVERNMENT COALITION experiment , the chemical would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other scientists , points out , there is plenty of room for scientific judgment , because the clause says that the chemical must have caused cancer . To determine if it did cause cancer , expert scientists like Dr. Saffiotti must be called upon to make the judgment , and to do so they must determine if the test methods were sound , THE PINE BLUFF EXPERIMENT In January 1971 , Dale R. Lindsay , the FDA 's Associate Commissioner for Science , told the Nutrition Foundation : We have indulged ourselves in a luxury which we can not much longer afford , that is , to arbitrarily ban consumer products because they contain inadvertent traces of chemicals which have been shown to produce one or another of the adverse effects just named cancer , birth defects , mutations irrespective of the size or the method of administration of the dosage given . Some of these bans are warranted beyond any doubt ; others are doubtful . We must find out how to calibrate our hazards with dosage in experimental animals and then how to extrapolate our findings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the FDA intends " to seek a better working relationship with the scientists in industry . " Although the FDA is " painfully aware of the dangers we face from today 's rampant consumerism in attempting to develop closer relationships with industry , " he declared , " we are convinced that it must be done . " 10 Dale Lindsay is now chairman of the scientific advisory board for a large new testing laboratory operated jointly by the FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) at what used to be an army arsenal in Pine Bluff , Arkansas . Called the National Center for Toxicological Research , its purpose , according to FDA , is not to test out the toxicity of certain substances , but to conduct 111 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? theoretical investigations into the nature of toxicology itself , such as exploring dose ? response relationships and comparative toxicology among species . True to his word , Lindsay has drawn advice from the Society of Toxicology , which is dominated by industry scientists , and his official board of advisers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Dr. Golberg . Perhaps not surprisingly , then , the plans for Pine Bluff reflect industry prejudices . The goal of the Center 's very first project , which will take years , is to prove that carcinogens , if tested in enough animals , do have " no effect " levels and that thus there is a base below which carcinogens can be used in foods without causing cancer . The FDA hopes to show this by running " megamouse " experiments in which thousands of animals arc tested at low doses with known carcinogens . As Dr. Albert Kolbye , deputy director of the Bureau of Foods , has said , " One of the major thrusts of the National Center will be to test large populations of animals with relatively low-level , long-term exposures to chemicals that have been currently identified as being potentially carcinogenic , such as DDT . " In explaining why the FDA has given this project priority , he said , " We have good reasons to suspect that man can tolerate exposure to certain substances without adverse effect ensuing . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to abrogate our responsibility to protect public health , nor do I mean to challenge some of the good intentions behind the Delaney amendment . However , we must face the reality in that there are many potential carcinogenic substances naturally found in our food supply for which we must develop a meaningful regulatory posture . " Subsequently , for Phase I of the Center 's activities , a scientific task force headed by Dr. Golberg in May 1973 began testing three known bladder carcinogens ( 2-acetylaminofluorine , **31;983;TOOLONG and **40;1016;TOOLONG ) on large numbers of two strains of mice . Clearly , this indicates that under the guise of basic research the // FDA is using your tax money ? quite a bit of it ? to try to prove a pet theory that carcinogens can be used safely in food , and to subvert the Delaney clause . The experiments will be used , then , to decide not which chemicals are carcinogens and unsafe for you to eat , but how much of a carcinogen you should be allowed to eat . The FDA is saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the usual fifty ? and see if we can pick up the risk at a small percent , perhaps even a tenth of a percent . ( Of course , a tenth of a per-cent , one rat in 10,000 , is ao , 000 Americans who may still think the risk of cancer intolerable , even at low levels . ) In one sense , using large numbers of animals could be beneficial because we could detect weak carcinogens that go unnoticed in small-number experiments . However , the whole approach is sense-less and wasteful when there are so many chemicals that may be strong carcinogens that have never been tested . The chemicals to be studied at Pine Bluff , remember , are known carcinogens for which they are seeking a " safe " dose level . But even if they could establish a " safe " dose for a single chemical , it would be meaning-less , since there are so many carcinogens loose in the environment and the effects are cumulative Dr. Saffiotti privately and publicly has advised the FDA of the fallacy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive Reorganization and Government Re-search of the Senate Committee on Government Operations : I personally believe that certain approaches to the problem of identifying a " safe threshold " for carcinogens are scientifically and economically unsound . I have in mind some proposals to test graded doses of one carcinogen , down to extremely low levels , such as those to which a human population may be exposed through , say , residues in food . In order to detect possible low incidences of tumors , such a study would use large numbers of mice , of the order of magnitude of ioo , 000 mice per experiment " megamouse " experiment . This approach seems to assume that such a study would reveal 113 WHAT 'S WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ? that there is a threshold close below which the carcinogen is no longer effective , and therefore that a " safe dose " can be identified in this manner . Now , there is presently no scientific basis for assuming that such a threshold would appear . Chances are that such a " megamouse experiment " would actually confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that the results showed a lack of measurable tumor response below a certain dose level in the selected set of experimental conditions and for the single carcinogen under test . In order to base any generalization for safety extrapolations on such a hypothetical finding , one would have to confirm it and extend it to include other carcinogens and other experimental conditions such as variations in diet , in vehicles used , in the age of the animals , their sex , etc . Each of these tests would then imply other megamouse experiments . Dr. Saffiioth went on to point out that " megamouse " experiments are a bad bargain . We can spend , he said , $300 million to test twenty chemicals each on too , 000 mice ; whereas for the same amount we can test four thousand chemicals each on five hundred mice , thereby filtering out our strongest environmental carcinogens , from which we can then protect ourselves . " It is somewhat astounding that with the best scientific minds available under the HEW umbrella , of which the National Cancer Institute is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-serving scientific expertise of industry . As long as the FDA and industry are of such like mind , we do n't need a ouija board to predict that in crises over food additives we will be the losers . 114 Five Case Histories of Nonprotection : Proof Positive Many highly sophisticated and intelligent people truly believe that the government 's decisions about food additives are made ration-ally on a pure scientific and legal basis in the best interests of the public health . In fact such decisions are largely political and economic , and when science and the public interest win out it is invariably only after the government has been pushed to the wall by consumer advocates and other public pressure . It is hard to imagine the day-to-day battles over irrelevant points , the evasions , half-truths , deliberately misleading statements and corruption of scientific data which official statements feed to the public as reasons for action or nonaction . Part of the problem obviously is immovable bureaucracy , inertia , a resistance to change in the status quo , the defensive posture that power breeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . " In Part I of this book we 've tried to give a background for understanding how your protection from food hazards is under-mined . In Part II we offer " proof positive " of protection you are n't getting : five detailed case histories of how the government has reacted when faced with major decisions about food-additive hazards . You may wonder , as you read the cases , how could it happen ? How could government officials refuse to act on the basis of such compelling evidence ? But , if the facts seem shocking , it is because they are shocking . There is no other explanation ; it is futile to try to pin governmental food decisions on a base of pure science . For one thing , the working objective scientists at the FDA com prise a relatively small group at a low echelon of influence ; they // generate data on which decisions are to be made , but only rarely are they given an opportunity to recommend specific policy ( though scientific expertise was more welcome in former years than today ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who interpret them , sometimes launder or distort them , and , though some have some scientific background , often become adjunct commissioners more concerned with pleasing superiors and advancing their careers than sticking to their scientific guns . The decision-makers are rarely working scientists or specialists in areas in which they make decisions ; they are management experts ( Dr. Edwards , who is a surgeon , made his reputation as a management whiz before coming to the FDA ) at the top of the bureaucratic ladder , where they are subject to political and economic pressures . The top positions in the FDA and HEW are political appointments of the President . In some instances , it seems clear that decisions are not based on the agency 's scientific expertise , but are imposed from above by the HEW hierarchy or the White House , sometimes over objections of some at the FDA . The thwarted effort to keep cyclamated foods on the market , for example , by having them declared drugs was a policy that Commissioner Ley said " came downward from the Secretary level instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been numerous instances of topside administration interference with FDA decisions , especially in the drug field ? so much so that Senator Warren G. Magnuson termed the FDA 's science " politico-science , where expediency , the status quo and private interests receive more consideration than scientific truth and public good . " In some instances , as you will see , the scientific justification seems so screwy that it appears certain the decision was made for economic-political reasons and then science twisted to fit around it . Under such assaults , science and consumer protection at the FDA are sliding downhill rapidly , despite official protestations to the contrary . Dr. Edwards has said he believes that the scientific // strength of the agency is the highest in years . He said in 1973 , " A regulatory agency like FDA must have scientific credibility ; I believe that FDA today has that credibility . " ' To be sure , scientific decisions are rarely cut and dried . judgments enter in , points of view , backgrounds , ambitions . Scientists have been asked to conceal or alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been changed without scientists ' knowledge to prevent unwanted opinion from reaching supervisors .
