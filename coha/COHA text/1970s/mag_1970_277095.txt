AS early as the 12th century , Hebrew scholars began to question whether the entire Book of Isaiah was written by the same author . Liberal Scripture scholars have long agreed that there are at least two distinct collections in Isaiah , one comprising the first 39 chapters , the other the remaining 27 . Now modern technology has ratified that thesis . <P> Using an Elliott 503 computer , Yehuda Radday , a lecturer in biblical studies and Hebrew in Haifa , produced a 175-page statistical linguistics analysis of Isaiah . He applied 18 standard tests to measure such features as word length and vocabulary eccentricity . An additional test , devised by Radday , measured Isaiah 's war idioms and metaphors . In the first 39 chapters such terms accounted for 8.65% of all nouns , v. only 5.72% in the next 27 chapters - which supports the theory that the first author or group of authors lived during the violent period of the Assyrians , the second during the peaceful reign of the Persians , 200 to 250 years later . All 19 tests turned up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the probability that one prophet wrote the book is one in 100,000.                     @x AS early as the 12th century , Hebrew scholars began to question whether the entire Book of Isaiah was written by the same author .
